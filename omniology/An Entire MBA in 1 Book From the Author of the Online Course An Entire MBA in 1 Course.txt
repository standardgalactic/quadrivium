PLEASE READ THIS FIRST: PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK 
Many business concepts are simply common sense. This book will focus on business concepts that you 
need to know that might not be common sense! This book will teach you everything you need to know 
about business….from starting a company to taking it public. Most business books are significantly 
outdated. This book leverages many incredible online resources and makes the whole business, accounting 
and finance process very easy! There are many incredibly engaging and entertaining video links in the book 
to YouTube and other sources; edutainment rocks! I tried to visualize the content of this book as much 
as possible as this is a more impactful and enjoyable way to learn (think Pinterest versus the tiny words 
in the Economist)!   
The contents of this book are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, 
the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I 
worked at Citadel and most recently based on my 
experience at a prominent San Francisco based venture 
capital firm. I also included helpful practical business 
concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia 
University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill 
University. Think of this book as a “greatest hits” 
business summary from my MBA, undergraduate 
business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, 
hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own 
companies.  
As the title of this book suggests, this is an entire MBA in 
1 book; this book will help you accomplish your business 
career goals. I have minimized “boring theoretical 
concepts” in this book in order to keep it as close to 
reality as possible. I hope you enjoy it! In addition to 
teaching at 4 universities in the Bay Area, you can find 
other     courses that I teach online at : 
www.tiny.cc/chris1 
I hope you enjoy this book! I am a firm believer that ‘edutainment’ works best!  
Thanks a lot,

CHAPTER 1: LAUNCHING A NEW VENTURE 
 
“I've failed over and over and over again in my life  
and that is why I succeed.”

Before we begin, please watch this video and believe every damn word of it: www.tiny.cc/chris4 .  
 
WHAT MAKES A GREAT ENTREPRENEUR / LEADER? 
 
You can’t successfully launch a new venture unless you and your management team have incredible 
management qualities. What are some of the qualities that make a great leader or entrepreneur? 
 Passion 
 Optimistic 
 Forward thinking 
 Strategic 
 Determined 
 Team players 
 Long term focused 
 Resilient 
 Great sales skills as all great CEOs and entrepreneurs are superb salespeople.  
Wait a minute…what if I don’t have any experience at all? Don’t worry, investors will take you seriously if, 
in addition to a great business model, you also have incredible board advisors. In the networking section 
of this book I will show you how easy this is to do. Mark Zuckerberg is no smarter than you are. Prior to 
dropping out of school, Mark surrounded himself with incredible advisors, including Peter Thiel (the 
founder of PayPal) as well as Sean Parker (the founder of Napster) and Justin Timberlake…um no not Justin 
Timberlake, that was in the Social Network movie only!

THE MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS SKILL 
 
Networking is crucial in business. You 
can’t successfully launch a new venture 
unless you network. This short video will 
change your life: www.tiny.cc/chris5 . 
You need to ask in business.  
Many of us use iPhones and iPads and 
other Apple products because of one 
simple business and life strategy that 
Steve Jobs practiced from a very young age: “Ask and you shall receive.” Steve Jobs never had issues 
reaching out and asking for help from strangers. You will be amazed how many people want to help you if 
you just ask! Fortunately, not many people do this. 
When Steve Jobs was only 12 years old he called Bill Hewlett from Hewlett Packard. The young Steve Jobs 
asked Bill Hewlett if he could give Steve spare parts for a device that he was creating. Hewlett laughed and 
not only gave him the spare parts, but gave Steve Jobs a job! 
Many of us are too shy or we think that it is outside of our comfort zone to ask for help, especially from 
strangers. Culturally it feels uncomfortable for many people to ask for help or ask strangers for something. 
You need to do this often. 
THE EASY WAY TO GET CUSTOMERS OR A JOB! 
So in this day and age of social media, how do we successfully ask for help? It’s much easier than you 
think. In LinkedIn please do an advanced search and find people with something in common with you. If 
you are from Bombay but live in the United States and live in New York, enter Bombay in LinkedIn and 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 17 of 384 
then the zip code that you live in. Then send an “inMail” message in LinkedIn with a very short message 
as follows: 
John, 
Hope all is well. I am also from Bombay and I also live in New York. Please let me know if you have time 
for a coffee in the next few weeks. 
Thanks a lot, 
Chris 
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 18 of 384 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 19 of 384 
 
Yes it is that easy! People really do want to help you, especially the farther away you get from the place 
you grew up in. You can also reach people by leveraging your school as follows: 
Matt, 
Hope all is well. I also went to McGill University and I also live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Please let 
me know if you have time for a coffee in the next few weeks. 
Thanks a lot, 
Chris 
Trust me – this works! My success rate on getting meetings with strangers using LinkedIn has always 
been very high. Why? Because I ask often and most people don’t. The key is to find at least one thing you 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 20 of 384 
have in common and mention this in your very brief and very polite message. This works exceptionally 
well. It works because very few people do it. Too many people today use email which is why it is not an 
effective tool to set up meetings. InMails work. Please try it. I promise you that you will be amazed at the 
outcome! Relationships are always more important than product knowledge. People want to help 
you! Simply ask and you shall receive : ) 
 
If you set up one informational meeting per week with someone that works at a company you want to 
work at for at least 20 weeks then I guarantee you that you will get an amazing job or customers. Please 
try it!

SOURCES OF ENTREPRENEURIAL IDEAS 
 
How do we come up with ideas to launch 
a company? What are the best sources?  
Before coming up with ideas, we must 
make sure that the size of the Total 
Addressable Market (or T.A.M.) is 
massive. Why? Because most start-ups 
fail and if you are successful, you don’t 
want to get a small piece of a small pie. 
In venture capital we generally look for 
the TAM to be at least $20bn. The 
rationale is that if a company is successful 
and able to capture 5% of the market 
then it can achieve an annual revenue 
target of $1bn (or 5% of $20bn).  
Start-up ideas and business themes last 
longer than we think. The same can be 
said for business trends. Here is a great 
example:  
Can you believe that the management 
team below changed the world? Guess 
who they are: The management team in 
this picture saw the cover of a magazine in the 1970s 
called Popular Electronics on the next page which 
changed their (and our) lives!  
Any idea who they are? It was none other than Bill 
Gates and his friend Paul Allen who decided in the 
1970s that “one day there would be a computer on 
every desk and in every home.” This was close to 40 
years ago and that investment trend still has legs! 
Investment trends last much longer than we think 
they do.  
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 22 of 384 
Other investment ideas that are only in the early 
innings of customer adoption includes the cloud 
computing paradigm shift where companies and 
consumers are putting much more data up in the 
cloud.  
 
 
 
Global trends include, the material infrastructure development we see in Dubai or China:   

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 23 of 384 
Other trends include the buildout of the 
Internet, which was initially created in the 
late 1960s by the US government in case 
there was a nuclear war and the east 
coast of the US could not communicate 
with the west coast.  
The ‘Internet of things’ trend is another 
one that is in the early innings. We are 
seeing many startups focused on this 
area.  
Hollywood also has a material impact on 
investment ideas too! Many great tech 
products only exist because of Hollywood 
dreampreneurs that predicted the self-fulfilling 
way that technology will enhance our lives in 
the future; the future is now.  
Hollywood has always had a fascinating and 
material impact on consumer technology. 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 24 of 384 
Hollywood is also the place where technology meets the liberal arts. One can argue that we would not 
have many cool consumer tech products without Hollywood’s influence on empowering the empowers to 
dream in tech. There are so many superb examples of this, including Star Trek’s beam me up device, which 
was the genesis of the flip phone. What is fascinating about Star Trek is that they were on such a tight 
budget that the only reason that the beam me up device existed was because filming scenes of the Star 
Trek Enterprise landing on planets was really expensive; as a result, Scotty beamed them up! Without Star 
Trek we might not have sophisticated space dreampreneurs like Elon Musk.  
Other cool Hollywood/media ideas that are now a reality include screen sharing scenes in Avatar that is 
now Apple’s AirPlay, hand based gestures from Minority Report and the voice based operating system 
from Her; Scarlett Johansson you rock! Even this year’s superb Ex Machina movie is now a reality; if you 
visit the awesome tech entrepreneurial Cuckoo’s Nest in Menlo Park you are greeted by robots! Talk about 
forward thinking! This place is also the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.  
Companies that have historically dominated operating systems like Microsoft (Windows), Apple (iOS) and 
Amazon (AWS) are all aggressively vying to be the market leader in voice based operating systems. You 
can witness the impact of the media on Microsoft as the company’s Cortana voice product was named 
after a character in Halo; how cool is that! The movie 2001 A Space Odyssey had a chilling voice based 
operating system called HAL that was the genesis for today’s voice based operating system. If you add one 
letter to H.A.L., you get I.B.M. which is also making progress in the voice market. The movie 2001 A Space 
Odyssey was released in 1968 while Star Trek was on television; the 1960s was such an incredible decade 
for tech influence and superb social justice (the two are not mutually exclusive).     
Here are links to three movies that have a material impact on Silicon Valley venture capital investments 
from a graphical user interface perspective:Minority Report: www.tiny.cc/chris7  and the movie Her: 
www.tiny.cc/chris8  
We must keep in mind that start-up ideas are irrelevant if we don’t have the right management team.  
The best CEOs and entrepreneurs are also superb salespeople. We need to beef up our sales skills in order 
to create a successful company. When you start a company you are constantly raising money. For more 
information on how to raise money, please see: www.tiny.cc/chris107 .

ETHICS 
 
All you have in business is your integrity. You might fail one or 
more times (which is ok) at launching a company, but you can 
only lose your reputation www.tiny.cc/chris9 . 
Transparency builds trust – especially when it comes to crisis 
management; with crisis comes opportunity. This is precisely 
what happened in 1994 with Intel. The company noticed a 
small issue that would result in incorrect calculations for a 
very small percent of computer users running on Intel’s latest Pentium processor. Once CEO Andy Grove 
found out about the incident he informed the general public about a recall which cost the company close 
to $500mn.  
What Andy Grove didn’t realize would happen is that he accidentally created the most important 
marketing campaign in the history of the semiconductor industry. Many people watching the news that 
day didn’t know what Intel was. By the end of the relatively benign crisis management event, the first 
impression many consumers had of the Intel brand was that of trust.   
Many other technology companies are also incredibly transparent and this creates outstanding brand 
loyalty and significantly enhances shareholder value. More importantly, it’s the right thing to do. 
Salesforce.com discloses all outages and security issues in real time on this web site: www.tiny.cc/chris10  
Google 
is 
also 
incredibly 
transparent. 
 Google 
even 
discloses all Google self-driving 
car incidents online at this site: : 
www.tiny.cc/chris11 
When 
companies 
are 
transparent, 
customers and investors are 
more comfortable doing business 
with 
or 
investing 
in 
the 
underlying company. This often 
leads to stellar long term revenue 
growth and in many cases, stock 
price appreciation.  Always be 
100% transparent in business, 
especially with the risks of the 
product or service you are selling. 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 26 of 384 
All you have in business is your reputation, which you take with you from one employer or start up to 
another. 
I always feel that it is important to disclose risks within the first 30 minutes of a meeting with a potential 
or existing client. It’s the right and ethical thing to do. It also leads to trust which is of paramount 
importance in business. It’s crucial to disclose all risks to your clients or prospective clients before doing 
business with them. The only reason you might not offer 100% disclosure is in the rare situation when you 
can’t divulge an issue due to confidentiality reasons. If this is the case and if the investment or 
product/service has significant risks that outweigh the potential returns, then don’t sell the 
product/service. Life is too short to destroy your or your company’s reputation and compromise your 
values. 
I love Warren Buffett’s quote of “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you 
think about that, you'll do things differently.” Companies like Google, Salesforce and Intel have developed 
an incredibly loyal following over the years given their intense focus on ethics and transparency. It’s not a 
coincidence that Google, Salesforce and Intel are all the market leaders in their sectors as transparency 
builds trust.  
 
INVESTMENT STAGES 
 
When you start a company, this is 
called the “seed stage”. During 
the seed stage you have a 
concept or an unproven business 
model. At this stage you might 
raise money from friends, family 
or from what are called “seed” or 
“angel” investors. This is usually a 
smaller amount ($10,000 to 
$500,000).  
7 or more years later (on average 
if you are successful) then you go 
public. This is called an initial 
public offering which is run by an investment bank. We will cover this topic in detail later in this book.  
Quite often, in between the seed stage and the IPO stage you receive funding from either venture capital 
firms or banks. I strongly recommend never getting bank loans in the first 2 or 3 years of the company’s 
life cycle. The reason is that banks are brutal when it comes to missing just one payment. More often than 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 27 of 384 
not, if you miss just one payment to a bank, then your business dies as the banks come after your assets. 
Brutal! We will cover the different ways to raise money in great detail in a future chapter.  
You will find that you are always raising money when you start a company until you are cash flow positive, 
which can be several years after you launch a company. I don’t recommend raising money from friends or 
families as this can strain your important personal relationships. I also don’t recommend using your own 
money to start a company unless you have a lot of it! Don’t ever put your family at risk of losing your house 
or your lifestyle via debt. Don’t worry, we will go into a lot of detail on how to legally protect your family 
when starting a company and how to raise money from high net worth investors, corporations and venture 
capital firms.  
In this book you will also learn how to present to different types of investors and how to significantly 
increase your chances of raising money.  
 
WHAT KIND OF LEGAL ENTITY SHOULD I SET UP?  
 
There are many different types of companies that you can set up and each has their pros and cons as 
follows:  
Proprietorship: This is a company registered in one person’s name: 
 
 
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 28 of 384 
General Partnership: This is a company registered in two or more people’s names: 
 
Limited Partnership: This is a company registered where some partners (i.e., investors) are partners in the 
firm but their influence on the company is limited (they are usually passive investors): 
 
 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 29 of 384 
Corporations: This is a company registered usually in many people’s names and has a large board of 
directors and is necessary for an IPO: 
 
 
Limited Liability Corporation: My favorite type of legal structure for a new company is the LLC (limited 
liability corporation) as this type of entity can protect your house and personal assets if your company gets 
sued:  
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 30 of 384 
The annual cost to have a limited liability company is $800 in California, $300 in Delaware and can vary 
by region. More details are available at www.business.usa.gov. At this website simply search for “register 
LLC” then select “Start a Business Wizard” or “choose your business structure” or “forming an LLC blog.”  
Quite often companies choose to register in Delaware as it is more cost effective to do so in this state 
(among other reasons: www.tiny.cc/chris12 ). You can register a Delaware based company here: 
www.tiny.cc/chris13 .

WHAT ABOUT TAXES? 
In order to simplify how taxes work for companies or individuals, there are 4 government tax schedules 
that matter as follows:  
Taxes for Single People:  
 
Taxes for Married Couples (filing together):

Page 33 of 384 
Taxes for Married Couples (filing separately): 
 
Taxes for Companies 
 
What does all of this mean? Let’s look at an example. If a corporation makes $100,000 then how much tax 
will it have to pay?

Given the fact that we are looking at calculating taxes for a corporation, we have to use the “Taxes for 
Companies” table. The answer is not 34%. It’s not that easy! It’s not too hard either. It’s just a few steps 
as follows:  
The company pays 15% tax on the first $50,000 that it makes ~ meaning between $0 and $50,000(or 
$7,500).  
The company pays 25% tax on the next $25,000 it makes ~ meaning over $50,000 and $75,000 of income 
(or $6,250).  
The company pays 34% on the next $25,000 it makes ~ meaning between $75,000 and $100,000 (or 
$8,500).  
This means that the total tax paid on $100,000 of corporate income is $7,500 + $6,250 + $8,500 = $22,250 
or 22.25% 
Now if a company issues dividends, then the recipient has to also pay taxes on the dividends. Hence, we 
get double taxation with dividends. WTF? Why the face : )  
 
HOW DO I STOP COMPETITORS FROM ILLEGALLY COPYING MY PRODUCTS?  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 35 of 384 
What does that symbol R or TM or C with a circle around it mean? I see that stuff everywhere! Well this is 
a legal way to protect your stuff. You can also stop your employees from leaking your corporate secrets 
using an NDA (non-disclosure agreement…more details on this soon). 
Patents: 
You can legally protect your product from being copied by filing a patent, which usually costs about $1k or 
much higher for a complex product (Google “hire a patent lawyer” rather than trying to do it yourself: 
www.tiny.cc/chris14 ). Once you file the patent, it takes about a year for it to be completed. While you 
wait to have the patent protected you are basically protected as if the patent had already been granted. 
This is why you often hear of the term “patent pending”.  
Trademarks: 
How do you protect the name of your company or the name of a brand like Google or Microsoft? You file 
a trademark. If you want to protect your brand in all states in the United States, then you file a registered 
trademark, which is an R with a circle around it: ®. If you want to save money on expensive lawyers and 
just protect your brand in one or a few states (instead of on a federal level), then the trademark is TM with 
a circle around it: ™.  
Copyright: 
What if I want to protect something you can’t touch like music or software or movies? In this case you can 
protect it with a copyright, which is a C with a circle around it©. A copyright lasts for 50 years after you 
die, which is why classical music is cheap to buy! Copyright is very common in the software sector. If you 
don’t file many copyrights in software, you can lose control of protecting your company 
(www.tiny.cc/chris16)! On your computer in any software program go to the help and then go to “about” 
(pronounced “aboooooot” in my Canadian accent! www.tiny.cc/chris17 ) and look for ® or © symbols.

Trade Secrets & NDAs: 
If I file patents then aren’t I giving away my company secrets? Potentially yes. This is why some companies 
have “trade secrets” and protect their trade secrets by making employees sign complex length contracts. 
Companies can even get employees to sign NDAs or non-disclosure agreements which means there are 
legal ramifications to breaking employment contracts www.tiny.cc/chris18 . Be careful with legal contract 
documents. If they are handed to you, pay a lawyer a few hundred dollars to help you understand what 
you are signing. Lawyers are a necessary evil. You need to protect your family by seeking their advice 
whenever you are considering signing an employment or large investment related legal contract.

THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT BUSINESS SKILL 
Your ability to present to investors, customers, potential customers and peers is a crucial skill that you 
can improve at with practice. Please keep in mind that “less is always more” when it comes to 
presenting. The best CEOs and entrepreneurs often have the best presentation skills. Don’t worry as you 
can improve materially with practice. Steve Jobs is the best presenter in history in my opinion. He didn’t 
start off this way: www.tiny.cc/chris19  
Compare and contrast that last video with how Steve Jobs presented later in life. Watch for how easy it is 
to understand him and how simplistic his slides are (less is more):  
www.tiny.cc/chris20 
In business presentations there is no need to be nervous. As strange as this might sound, when you present 
you need to remember that nobody is smarter than you. I am not telling you to be arrogant, just confident 
and passionate. This video will change your life (repeated on purpose):  
www.tiny.cc/chris21   
Rather than teach you how to present via boring text, I decided to simply paste presentation slides..less is 
always more…you can also watch the presentation version of this chapter online at http://tiny.cc/chris108

Observe how politicians or passionate business 
leaders like Marc Benioff or Richard Branson 
present. Also, watch for superb presentations

A few simple words can literally change the world. Watch this incredible speech by the late great Ronald 
Reagan in front of the Berlin Wall. Reagan went off script and created these two brilliant phrases that 
ended communism: “Open this gate”. “Tear down this wall”.

A common enemy is not something that only politicians use. Successful advertising campaigns also 
highlight who the enemy is. Here is an incredible 
commercial that Apple aired just one time in 1984 
during the super bowl. The athlete represents 
Apple and every other character represents IBM: 
www.tiny.cc/chris23  
In 2007 Apple used a commensurate strategy using 
humor to ridicule the competition, which was then 
Microsoft (the character in this video looks a little 
bit like Bill Gates):  www.tiny.cc/chris25

 Steve Jobs used the phrase ‘insanely great’ a lot. 
Always present in layman’s or easy to understand 
terms. Oddly enough, some business executives 
chose to present at an 8th grade (or lower) 
vocabulary level in order to reach the widest 
audience possible. My kids have always been so 
excited after each Apple keynote presentation as 
nobody communicates better to the masses than 
Apple does.

Your audience will pay more attention to you if you 
use your hands often as this makes you present in 
a much more passionate and engaging way.  
 
 
 
If you try your best to make eye contact with as 
many people as possible when you are presenting, 
then most people will pay attention as they feel 
that you are communicating directly with them.  
 
 
When you say something prophetic in a speech or 
somewhat confrontational, pause for about 2 
seconds. Then resume your presentation. This 
dramatic pause is incredibly effective. The next 
time you see a politician like Barrack Obama on 
television, watch how he uses dramatic pauses.  
 
 
Speak honestly from your heart and don’t 
memorize speeches or use cue cards. If you speak 
from the heart you will come across as incredibly 
engaging and sincere.

It’s a cliché, but every battle is won before it has been fought. You can become literally the best 
presenter in the world (yes) if you practice a lot. I sometimes record myself with my iPhone and I watch 
for my bad habits, which includes the words “um”, “ah”, etc… I also try to watch that my voice isn’t too 
monotone. I practice in front of my wife and friends often before presenting to a large audience.  
 
 
 
Malcolm Gladwell coined the term “the 10,000 rule” in his book called Outliers. Each of the stars above 
practiced for literally 10,000 before they became the best in their game. See if you can name them all! The 
same can be said for Steve Jobs.  
As a proud Canadian, I will be incredibly insulted if you don’t recognize the “great one” in the black and 
white photo above : )

CHAPTER 3: VENTURE CAPITAL PART 1 
 
“Ideas are commodities. Execution is not.” 
- Michael Dell

Why do we spend so much time on venture capital in this book? The reason is that you always want to 
use other people’s money when starting a company (unless you are loaded). I don’t want you to put your 
family at risk by over leveraging yourself. I don’t want you to ever get bank loans either as banks will panic 
and make you pay back every penny if you are late on just one loan payment (and maybe come after your 
house…always put your family first)! Instead, I want you to sell part of your company (unless you are 
loaded) to an equity investor, including high net worths, companies or venture capital firms. It is so 
incredibly hard to get funded by a top venture capital firm. If a top venture capital firm funds you, then 
your chances of being successful rises materially. As such, we need to understand what these top venture 
capital firms look for in a company they are considering investing in! We also need to understand the 
fascinating history of the venture industry too (which we will do in another chapter…observe how the 
greatest entrepreneurs did it). 
 
THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTIC IS…. 
Venture capital firms focus primarily on having a superb management team unlike this dude presenting to 
a potential investor and also to venture capitalists. Pay very close attention to what not to do in this video:  
www.tiny.cc/chris36   
: )  
There is nothing more important with an investment that finding the right management team. The jockey 
is always more important than the horse. 
Ideas are commodities. Execution is 
not. The most important critical 
success factor in business is investing 
in the right management team and 
not investing in the right idea. Why is 
it that most business schools don’t 
dedicate any time to assessing the 
quality of a company’s management 
team? Shouldn’t this be the most 
important thing to consider before 
making an investment in a company? 
We spend far too much time 
analyzing business models, markets and financial statements and we often overlook the most important 
investment quality, which is who is running the company and are they the right choice?  
This is especially true in the money management or venture capital industry where the most important 
success factor in any investment is making sure that you have the right management team in place. The 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 63 of 384 
right management team can pivot, adapt and react to a material crisis or constantly changing end markets. 
The right management team can effectively market elegant products to their customers with the simplicity 
of Apple’s Steve Jobs and with the healthy paranoia of Intel’s Andy Grove. 
Past performance is indicative of future performance if you have the right CEO and the right management 
team. Yes that was a very controversial statement, but I believe that if you bet on a management team 
that has been extraordinarily successful in the past, then your chance of success betting on this 
management team in the future is materially higher than it is betting on a B or a C management team. 
The best CEOs and entrepreneurs don’t have a job; they have a passion. Superb examples of passionate 
CEOs and entrepreneurs include Richard Branson of Virgin, Marc Benioff of Salesforce, Christian Chabot of 
Tableau and Godfrey Sullivan of Splunk. The best CEOs and businesspeople in the world are passionate 
salespeople with unbelievably positive attitudes. Their positive attitudes lead to an incredibly positive 
corporate culture. Fly on Virgin America or Virgin Atlantic and you will understand why Virgin is an 
exceptional brand. Virgin employees are so happy that they don’t appear to have a job! Rather, they have 
a passion. Watch an interview with Richard Branson and you will understand why. 
Similarly, employees of technology company Splunk are incredibly positive people and this might be due, 
in part, to the incredible leadership of their CEO Godfrey Sullivan whose genius is that he praises often in 
public and only offers constructive feedback in private. The result is a relentless, positive ‘can-do’ attitude 
that resonates throughout the entire company. This has led to the creation of one of the best corporate 
cultures in the history of the technology sector.  
How do we assess if a CEO or an entrepreneur is worth backing? We can use www.Glassdoor.com  and 
read reviews of the management team written by employees. Godfrey Sullivan from Splunk and Marc 
Benioff from Salesforce both have 96% approval ratings according to Glassdoor.com from employees and 
Christian Chabot from Tableau has a 100% approval rating!  
How do we do additional background checks on a CEO before deciding to invest in the company? Never 
call references that the CEO provides as nobody would ever provide a reference list of people that wouldn’t 
say something positive! Rather, use LinkedIn and find contacts that you (or your friends/colleagues) have 
that know the CEO or people that work at the CEO’s company. Then simply call these contacts and ask for 
feedback on whether or not the CEO is an effective salesperson and leader. 
For private companies, read about the background of the management team on the company’s website. 
For publically traded companies, you can read the annual reports, which all have descriptions of the 
background experience of the executive team. You can find a wealth of information online at www.sec.gov 
. 
The productivity of employees of a company with a passionate, visionary leader is materially higher than 
the competition. More productive employees leads to enhanced shareholder value over time. We will all 
be much better investors if we spent a lot more time analyzing management teams. Only after we feel 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 64 of 384 
comfortable backing the right management teams should we start doing due diligence on the business 
model or the total addressable market. 
Ideas are commodities. Execution is not. Always bet on the jockey and not on the horse. 
 
WHAT IS VENTURE CAPITAL?  
 
When you start a company you raise money 
from friends or family members or high net 
worth individuals (if you can, avoid soliciting 
money from family and friends). All of these 
investors in an early stage company are 
referred to as “seed” or “angel” investors: 
Then once your company is huge and usually 
at least 7 or 8 years old and growth is 
positive but slowing, then a company goes 
public through an IPO (initial public offering):  
Everything in between the Seed investment 
and the IPO is what we refer to as venture 
capital:  
Venture capital is usually raised when a firm 
has been around for more than one year and 
the company needs access to larger pools of 
capital to grow. The first time a company 
raises money from a venture capital firm it is 
called “The A Round”. Then 1 or 2 years later 
when a start-up needs even more capital to 
grow then they raise even more money from 
another venture capital firm in what is called 
“The B Round”. Then in another 1-2 years 
when the firm needs even more capital to 
grow, then there is “The C Round”. Quite 
often companies do a D or E round and then 
they go public. 6 months after the IPO then 
the venture capital firms are allowed to sell 
their stake in the company and “harvest” 
their investment.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 65 of 384 
About 50% of all venture capital in the United States is based in the San Francisco Bay Area given the 
plethora of high quality technology engineers, of which more than 60% were born overseas.  
There has been a lot of recent interest in the venture capital from institutional investment firms that have 
historically focused on public only investments. Many publicly focused mutual fund companies are now 
also investing in the venture capital sector as they are realizing that technology companies are staying 
private much longer. Many technology 
companies are staying private much longer 
as they know that large cap technology 
companies like Cisco or HP or Oracle no 
longer have great organic growth prospects 
(given their size and the law of large 
numbers). The aforementioned companies 
have also realized that it makes more sense 
for them to acquire innovation instead of 
innovating internally. As a result, valuation 
has become a bit of an issue in venture 
capital lately.  
HOW DO VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS MAKE MONEY? 
 
Venture firms charge an annual 2% management fee that covers their labor and infrastructure overhead. 
Venture firms charge a 20% fee on investments that have been harvested through either an IPO or a sale 
to another company. For example, if you invested $100 in a venture capital fund for 5 years that had a 10x 
return profile, then you would make $790 as follows 
 Management fee = $2 annual management fee x’s 5 years = $10 in management fees over 5 
years 
 Fund carry (or ‘incentive’) fee of 20% + management fee= $100*10x return *0.20 fee minus 
the $10 management fees over 5 years = $210 fee for the venture capital firm over 10 years 
 Profit for the investor on a $100 investment = 100x10 -210 = $790  
Venture capital firms typically look to make 5x’s their money in 5 or so years on each company that they 
invest in. They call this “a 5 by 5”. The reason that they have to focus on significant returns is that most of 
their investments end up not making any money. For every Facebook, there are countless thousands of 
investments that run out of money and go belly up.

HOW DO I RAISE MONEY FROM A VC FIRM? 
 
In the previous section we covered the basics of presenting to potential investors. That was part of the 30 
minute first meeting with a VC firm. You need to also have a condensed 30 second “tweet pitch” which is 
also referred to as an elevator pitch. This 30 second pitch is crucial as you need it to get your first meeting 
with a venture capital firm.  
Once you get your first meeting with a venture capital firm, you need to sell yourself. They will be assessing 
you more so than your business model. Give them every reason to believe that you are a superb 
salesperson and the right passionate leader for your company. If you don’t have enough experience, then 
make sure that your board of advisors do! For more details on how to put together a board of advisors 
please refer to the networking section of this book. If you are building a tech company, then use your 
LinkedIn networking skills to get employees of Apple or Google or Facebook, for example, on your board. 
All you have to do is ask (that’s right). Investors will take you more seriously if you have a seriously 
awesome board. 
Make sure to keep your pitch to no more than 10 slides and dumb it down a lot as your investors are not 
as sophisticated as you think they are. Keep everything in easy to understand language like Steve Jobs did 
when pitching the iPhone or iPod or iPad to customers. I have a friend in Boston named Rubin Gruber from 
McGill University who has founded many incredibly successful companies, including Sonus Networks. 
Before starting any company, he flies up to Montreal and has dinner with his 90 year old mother who is 
also his best advisor. If he has trouble pitching the idea to his mom, then he either changes his approach 
or he decides not to launch that company.  
Make sure that you are an expert in the market that you are participating in when presenting to venture 
capital firms. You need to be able to discuss the total addressable market size, your anticipated market 
share and who your partners, investors and advisors are (name drop if you can). You also need very basic 
annual revenue and expense line items for at least 5 years.  
Show the product by the second slide of the presentation. You will be amazed how many people pitch 
business models without ever showing the product! By showing the product early in your presentation, 
your potential investors will have no problem paying attention or understanding your business model. If 
you confuse them in the first few minutes of a presentation, then you have lost them for good. Why? 
Because they won’t have confidence that you can sell to potential customers! Remember that the best 
founders and CEOs are incredible sales people like Marc Benioff from cloud company pioneer Salesforce, 
which is now the largest employer in San Francisco.  
Make sure that your pitch and slides are simplistic, elegant and be somewhat entertaining too. Be 
passionate about the company when presenting. You want to let them know that this is not a job for you. 
Rather, it is a passion. Keep it simple; less is always more!

THE FASCINATING HISTORY OF VENTURE CAPITAL 
In order to understand the brilliant minds of commerce, including Steve Jobs, Andy Grove, John Doer, Bill 
Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Marc Benioff, Doug Leone, Andy Bechtolsheim, and other Silicon 
Valley legends, we need to understand why Silicon Valley is the birthplace of so many incredible 
companies. Why is it relevant? Shouldn’t Boston be more relevant with MIT, Harvard and other great 
schools? Shouldn’t London be more relevant given Oxford, Cambridge and other great schools? What is it 
about Silicon Valley that makes brilliant drop outs like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg so successful?  
We need to do a deep dive on the genesis of Silicon Valley to really understand what drives entrepreneurs 
in this region and what we can learn from them. This chapter and Silicon Valley is where technology meets 
the liberal arts… 
The most successful people in business think different. They challenge conventional wisdom and authority 
and the way things are done. They don’t care what others think about them. They are pioneers. They are 
passionate. They are positive and often criticized; they believe that unjustified criticism is a disguised 
complement…and so they welcome criticism and thrive on it…..I love that! They are my business heroes 
and we will learn about what drove/drives them in this chapter.  
This will be a highly entertaining chapter. A video version of this chapter can be accessed online at 
www.tiny.cc/chris37 . 
Silicon Valley is relevant today because of many different 1960’s conflicts, including the following:  
 The conflict between the USSR and the USA. 
 The conflict between those in favor of and those against the war in Vietnam. 
 The conflict between those over 30 and those under 30. A popular hippie saying then was 
“don’t trust anyone over 30”. 
 Those in favor of drug use and those against drug use.  
 Those in favor of free love and those against it.

Most people don’t realize that the largest employer today in Palo Alto is not Facebook. Palantir 
(www.tiny.cc/chris39 )is now the largest Palo Alto based employer. Palantir makes an extremely 
sophisticated software program that solves many of the world’s most complex problems. In fact, a 
significant reason that the Obama administration was able to find Osama bin Laden was because of the 
use of Palantir.

America was worried about the Soviet Union’s superior rocket technologies and military might. Russia’s 
‘Sputnik’ rocket beat America’s rockets to space. National pride was a significant issue in the 1960s for 
America for so many reasons, including the cold war, many assassinations etc. America needed to get a 
person on the moon before The Soviet Union.  
   
 
 
Growing up in Canada we were warned that Soviet nuclear missiles would fly over Alaska and Canada en

PayPal is the most important technology company to go public in the past 20 years because out of PayPal 
came many incredible companies. Including the founders of YouTube, Yelp, Tesla, SpaceX and many more. 
Similar to the 1960s hippie heroes, Peter Thiel (the cofounder of PayPal along with Elon Musk) believes in 
decreasing government authority. His libertarian political views via PayPal intended to disintermediate 
government authority by creating a form of payment that governments could not regulate. Take away a 
government’s ability to alter monetary policy, and take away its most important weapon (the ability to 
print money in order to 
fund government projects or to stabilize economies etc.).

In the public markets, there is a notion that ‘past 
performance 
is 
not 
indicative 
of 
future 
performance.’ In the private markets it is though - if 
you have an incredible management team. A 
founder that has started and sold multiple 
successful start-ups has a much higher probability of 
being successful in the future. As a result, venture 
capitalists prefer to invest in solid management 
teams (ahead of solid ideas). For some reason, 
public market investors don’t spend enough time analyzing management teams. The jockey is always way 
more important than the horse with all investments.

Valuations are lofty for many venture backed 
companies today, but not nearly as egregious as 
what we saw when the last VC cycle peaked shortly 
after 1999 when Pets.com was still in business. 
When rates rise (and they will) then investors will 
likely invest in other asset classes. That being said, 
the best investors have a very long term 
investment time horizon and aren’t easily 
influenced by long term economic cycles.  
 
What Buffett is saying is common sense of course…but being a contrarian in the investment industry 
always pays off.

If you are looking for your company to get funded by 
a venture capital firm, it is imperative that you pick 
the right VC firm to partner with, otherwise you 
cannot be successful. Make sure the VC firm is early 
stage if your business is too. If you raised seed 
money and you are now looking for an A Round VC 
investor, then target a superb earlier stage VC firm 
like Sequoia or Kleiner. If you are closer to your initial 
public offering (IPO) and you want to do one more 
late stage D or E round, then try to work with the best late stage venture firms like Meritech, who have a 
great reputation and are fantastic trustworthy people too.  
To state the obvious, don’t approach venture capital 
firms or partners at these firms that don’t cover the 
market that your company operates in. Also, make 
sure the VC firm that you partner with has an 
impeccable reputation of helping founders grow 
their company (instead of being activist disturbers 
in board meetings…. “lead, follow or get out of the 
way” to quote Ted Turner).  
Make sure the venture firm that is going to finance your company’s growth has a similar view on their 
target return on investment period. If your business won’t likely do an IPO in 7-10 years, then make sure 
you pick a patient, long-term focused VC firm to work with.   
If your gut tells you not to trust them (even after a brief first meeting), then chose to partner with another 
venture firm. Your gut impression is right more often than not, when it comes to who to partner with in 
business.  
Make sure the VC firm is growth oriented (most are) instead of value focused if your firm isn’t going to be 
profitable for many years. There is nothing more stressful than having differing expectations of business 
goals than your investors do.  
Most venture capital firms charge their investors a 
2% annual management fee (to pay for salaries, rent 
etc.). Venture firms make most of their money, 
though, through a 20% incentive fee that they collect 
after they are profitable (as we covered in more 
detail earlier in this book). The “2 and 20” economics 
of the VC sector is commensurate with how the 
hedge fund industry works. The difference between 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 96 of 384 
the two sectors is that the hedge fund market is incredibly short-term focused and the venture capital 
sector is incredibly long-term focused.  
When you invest your money in a venture capital firm, you don’t give your entire agreed upon investment 
amount to the firm right away. Instead, they call you and ask for the capital as they need it. This is called 
“a capital call.” Venture firms will call you when they need to deploy the capital. Let’s look at an example. 
Let’s assume you are an “accredited investor”, meaning you have a very large liquid net worth and are 
allowed to invest in a venture capital firm. You agree to invest $100,000. The hypothetical venture capital 
firm you are investing in has a risk management policy of never investing more than 10% of their fund in 
any one particular company. Then one month after you agree to invest your $100,000 in the venture firm 
their CFO calls you and informs you that they are making a 10% (of their fund) investment in a company. 
They call you and ask for you to wire them $10,000 of your $100,000 investment. They will keep calling 
you and asking for money until about 80% or 90% of your capital has been invested or called for. The 10%-
20% of your money that has not been called for is left over in case another venture capital firm invests in 
a company the VC firm you invested in at a future round. This is to offset your percent ownership in a 
company from being diluted. This process is called “pro rata.” 
What does this mean? Let’s assume that 10% of a $100mn venture capital firm that you invested in was 
put in Facebook in say 2005 in the first VC funded round, called the A round. That means $10mn of the 
fund was invested in Facebook at a valuation of say $1bn. The CFO of the VC firm called you and asked for 
$10k from you for an investment in Facebook. Then in 2006 (1 year later) another venture capital firm 
invests in Facebook at a valuation of $2bn. Since Facebook is a great company and since the VC firm that 
you invested in doesn’t want their percent ownership of Facebook to be diluted, then they will call all of 
their investors and ask them to invest in Facebook again so that the amount they own of Facebook remains 
the same percent wise. This is called “pro rata”. You contribute more money (or your ”pro rata”) to offset 
dilution. This is why VC firms typically only invest 80%-90% of your investment as they leave 10% to 20% 
left over in case there are “pro rata” investment follow-on opportunities.  
We know that networking is the most important skill 
that we can learn in business. Venture capital firms 
get access to the best deals by networking 
aggressively. Your success in business will be 
predicated on the strength of your network, so 
make sure to connect with everyone you have ever 
met with using LinkedIn.  
Venture firms love to invest in the same 
entrepreneurs over and over again (of course assuming the executives they are investing in have had a 
successful exit in the past). Venture firms also work with competing venture firms by introducing them to 
their portfolio companies so that other VC firms can lead future rounds. Co-opetition in the venture 
industry makes it incredibly unique compared to other roles in financial services industries. You usually 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 97 of 384 
need to fight to get access to the best investments in VC though. If you are introduced to a potential 
investment by another VC firm or from a friend, always ask yourself “why am I so lucky to be seeing this 
investment opportunity?” Unfortunately the reason can sometimes be that nobody else wants to invest. 
Venture capitalists also love to spend time walking up and down the halls of the best universities in search 
of the next Google! 
Since venture capital firms often become “stuck 
holders” or long term shareholders in illiquid 
investments, they have to do an enormous amount 
of due diligence before deciding whether or not to 
invest in a company. Venture capital employees will 
leverage LinkedIn and find contacts of theirs (or 
their friends) that know the management team of a 
start-up they are considering investing in when 
doing background checks.  
Venture firms will also study the competition at length and often interview them as well. I found from 
working in the hedge fund industry years ago that meeting with competitors and asking them what the 
weaknesses are of their competitors really helps you to find gaps in an underlying company’s business 
model (of course assuming that you are not compromising your integrity by discussing confidential 
information with those not privy to this information).  
Venture firms will also analyze in great detail what the size is of a particular market they are considering 
investing in. Quite often they won’t invest in a company that has a T.A.M. or total addressable market of 
less than $20bn. Why? Because they want the company they are investing in to get at least 5% market 
share of this market in the very long run, which equates to $1bn+ in annual revenue. Venture firms have 
to aim high as many of their investments will lose money. Often all you need is a handful of investments 
in a given fund to make money for the fund to be incredibly profitable.  
I know that the end markets or business models of many companies that VC firms invest in will change 
materially in the long run. As such, it is always prudent to invest in industry veterans that have been 
successful pivoting or changing their business models in the past.  
Each venture capital round has a different venture 
capital firm leading the investment round. Investors 
in earlier rounds usually invest again as well so as 
not to get diluted (we covered this in the pro forma 
explanation). Most venture backed investor rounds 
have several different venture capital investors for 
risk management purposes. The same thing happens 
with IPOs and investment banks, which will cover

later in this book. Several investment firms working together is called an ‘investment syndicate’. Why does 
this happen? Because the investment rounds are enormous. Ask yourself “would I ever only get loans 
many years from now when my business is massive from just one bank?” Heck no! You need to diversify 
by doing business with several banks so they will compete for your business and give you the best terms.  
So what is a good blueprint to use for a successful 
venture capital investment? Here is a model that 
works (for VC and other investments): 
1) 
Make sure the management team is strong 
and with a deep bench (if it is a later stage 
investment). It is ok if the management team has 
failed in the past….but make sure they learned a lot 
from this failure and that they have had multiple 
successes (past exits) as well. Chances are if they 
have made other investors money in the past, then they will make you money as well (or at least have a 
higher probability of making you money). If the management team has no experience or if they are just 
out of school, make sure they have a solid board of advisors.  
2) 
As mentioned earlier, you need to invest in companies that compete in markets with enormous 
TAMs as you want to get paid huge if they make it big! 
3) 
If this is a later stage investment, it is more often than not prudent to make sure that the previous 
investors have great reputations for returning a very high return on investment to their investors over the 
years. The same can be said for an investment in anything! 
4) 
Lastly (yes I know it’s bizarre that I list this one last….) we need to make sure that the company has 
an incredibly disruptive business model. Can they do to the industry that they participate in what Airbnb 
has done to the hotel sector? What is unique and proprietary about their value proposition? Is the market 
too crowded? Is it scalable (meaning can revenue growth massively accelerate with little additional 
investment capital and labor)?  
I will keep saying this: ‘ideas are commodities, but execution is not’. Start always with a solid management 
team. If you aren’t thoroughly impressed by the management team’s ability to get you excited about their 
business prospects, then pass on this investment. Make sure that the founder(s) is not running the 
business to make money. Make sure that they are so incredibly driven that they want their company to 
literally change the world. Otherwise, this founder might look to sell the company at a very low return on 
investment. They need to convince you like you are a customer. They need to sincerely convince you that 
the reason that they were put on this earth was to make their company bigger and better than Apple, Inc.  
Attitude is everything.

There are many different legal structures for ownership of investment vehicles. We will only cover the 
most common ones and we will do so in easy to understand terms (my boss at hedge fund Citadel used to 
tell me that if I can’t explain it, then I don’t understand it)! 
You are done if you don’t lawyer up when starting a 
company!  www.tiny.cc/chris49 . As painful as it 
may seem, you need to hire a lawyer to help you 
with the legal paperwork of protecting you and your 
company and your company if you are accepting 
investments from anyone, including a venture 
capital firm. If it’s costly, don’t worry as you can bill 
this to your company. In fact, after you raise money 
from investors, you can bill your company for this. I 
used to amortize my legal set up fees for my companies over 60 moths (or 5 years), which is allowed under 
US corporate accounting laws.  
You wouldn’t operate on yourself if you needed surgery. Why? Because doctors spend 4-5+ years in 
medical school learnings how to not kill patients! The same can be said for lawyers, who spend 3+ years 
learning how to not kill your career, business and life. If you work for someone else, you need to hire a 
lawyer for $500+ to quickly review the contract you are signing so you can protect your family and your 
assets. Your employer is likely cool but her or his lawyer is never looking in the best interests of your family.

Your employer did not write the legal employment documents; Rather, her or his lawyer did…..so please 
lawyer up like Peter Parker did in that movie clip you just watched.  ; )  
 
 
   
 
If a company goes belly up and there is a little bit of money left over then the first to get their money back 
are the banks or people that loaned the company money. The last class of investors to get paid back are 
the common stock holders. Employees of a firm that is VC backed usually get common stock. The VC 
investors usually get shares that are better, or preferred. Not surprisingly, they are called preferred shares.  
Why would anyone want to own common stock then? Because they are very easy to buy and sell. Most 
stocks on the stock exchanges are common stock. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 101 of 384 
   
Don’t ever value your company too high when dealing with investors. I know that this sounds strange. If 
you raise multiple investment rounds, existing investors usually only agree to let you raise more money if 
it is done at a much higher valuation. Why? Because they want their shares to be worth more! If you raise 
more money at the same valuation as the previous investment round, then new investors have to be given 
new shares, which dilutes existing investors’ ownership stake in the company. Keep valuations low enough 
so that you have the luxury of being able to raise more money at a higher valuation in the future. A “down 
round” can destroy a company as existing investors and current employees will be upset that their 
investment is now worth less!  
  
 
It is always prudent to price the company during the A Round low enough so that you can do the B Round 
at a higher valuation.

Sometimes start-ups plan on doing the B round, for 
example, about 2 years after the A round. However, 
in 
this 
hypothetical 
scenario, 
the 
start-up 
unexpectedly immediately runs out of money 1.5 
years after the A round. As a result, the start-up 
needs to raise money right away. The start-up was 
planning on raising a large amount in 6 months 
anyway….but needs a small amount of capital to 
make sure they can make payroll before doing the 
Series B in 6 months (which is 2 years after the Series A). The start-up can raise debt from an investor (or 
venture debt investor like Silicon Valley Bank – also called SVB). This debt can be at an annual interest rate 
of say 8% and will convert into shares (or equity) 
once the B round is done at a 20% discount to the 
Series B valuation.  
Warrants can be granted to service providers like 
legal or debt firms that do business with a start-up. 
It is just another way to give financing flexibility to a 
start-up.  
 
 
Options are granted to employees slowly over a long 
period of time. An option is the right to buy or 
receive shares in a company in the future at a 
certain price. They are slowly granted over time or 
else employees might quit after receiving them. 
They are given usually over 4 years so that 25% of 
the options realize their true value (or “vest”) every 
year for 4 years. After two years this employee in 
this hypothetical example is “50% vested” and then 
“100% vested over 4 years”. CEOs of publically traded companies and many employees also receive stock 
options that “vest” over time. Vesting is also known as “golden handcuffs” for employees to make sure 
that they remain loyal and don’t leave for another company.

If you get out of bed in the morning and tell 
yourself that you are going to work, then you 
are doing it wrong. You need to keep 
changing careers until you find your passion. 
Find out what is the reason you were put on 
this earth to accomplish professionally.  
www.tiny.cc/chris50  
I repeat the most important themes in the 
book often, like finding your passion or the 
importance of networking and, of course, 
the importance of investing in the right 
people, which is more important than 
investing in the right business model. VC 
firms love investing in the best athlete.  
 
HOW MANY SHARES DO I HAVE AND HOW MANY DOES THE VC HAVE?  
 
I love baseball so this chapter we will use the best 
athlete analogy in venture by investing in the best 
athlete in baseball, who in my humble opinion is 
Giancarlo Stanton: www.tiny.cc/chris51   
In our hypothetical example, let’s assume that 
Giancarlo started a cool payments company similar 
to Square and that he was also a founder of PayPal, 
which he took public and then sold to eBay. So yes 
he has had an exit (and not just out of Dodger 
stadium)!  
Giancarlo designed a prototype or a P.O.C. (proof of 
concept) device that is a P.O.S. (ahem….a point of 
sale product that is). The P.O.C. was created using 
angel or seed money he raised from his a few high 
net worth investors.

Now Giancarlo needs to raise $1mn in an A Round. Since he has had an exit and he is the best athlete, 
naturally the best venture capital firm, Sequoia will lead the Series A. Sequoia thinks they will make a 50% 
annual return for 5 years (yes they are that good).

 As a side note, the best VC firms in the world have 
1% of their portfolios in ‘unicorns’, which means 
companies that have a valuation above $1bn. 
Sequoia has 5% of their portfolio in unicorns!  
Sequoia did a deep due diligence dive on the 
company and they think that the P.O.S. company will 
make $1mn in net income in 5 years.  
Giancarlo decided to launch the firm with an 
arbitrary 2mn shares. Don’t overthink this – it’s 
always a random number and results in a random 
share price at launch 
…usually well under $1 
per share. We will do a lot of math in the next few 
pages that will determine Giancarlo’s ownership in 
the firm….but the original price per share and the 
number of shares is always given and not calculated.  
 
Awesome! One of Giancarlo’s competitors did an 
IPO at a price / earnings multiple of $20mn divided 
by $2mn in net income of a P/E or price to earnings 
multiple of 10 times! Hmm – ok this means that in 5 
years when Giancarlo’s company makes $1mn in net 
income, then he and Sequoia agree that their P.O.S. 
firm will be worth the same 10x multiple or 10 x’s 
$1mn or $10mn! Sweet!  
If the firm is worth $10mn in 5 years then what is 
the firm worth today? Well Sequoia expects to make 
50% annually on this investment. So if we know that 
the company is worth $10mn in 5 years (which is 
10x’s $1mn in net income), then what is $10mn in 5 
years worth today? We need to discount $10mn 
over 5 years assuming that it will be worth 50% 
more annually each year for 5 years.

Page 110 of 384 
The math is calculated as follows (I will use another 
example first): if I tell you that you have an 
investment in a hypothetical company that will go 
up 50% in one year to be worth $1mn, then today 
your investment is worth $1mn / 1+50% = 
1,000,000/1.5 = $666,667.  
Ok now if I tell you that if you invested a certain 
amount of money for 2 years and each year you 
would make a 50% return and that the value of your investment is $1mn in 2 years, then how much would 
you need to invest today? In this example we need to discount the $1mn over 2 years as follows: 
$1,000,000/(1+50%)^2  = $444,444. 
Ok so if Sequoia expects to make 50% per year for 5 years, then $10,000,000 in 5 years is worth what 
today? $10,000,000 / (1.5)^5 = $1,316,872 today. Or $1,316,872 that appreciates 50% annually for 5 years 
= $1,316,872 *1.5^5 = $10,000,000.. Recall that Giancarlo wants to raise $1mn from Sequoia so he can 
build his P.O.S.. So what percent of the firm does Sequoia own today? The firm is worth $1,316,872 today, 
so Sequoia owns $1,000,000 / $1,316,872 or 76% of the company, leaving Giancarlo owning 24% of the 
firm.  Per the next image, we already know that Giancarlo owns 2mn shares, so we can calculate how many 
shares Sequoia owns.  
 
Cool. So Sequoia owns 6.3mn shares, and $1mn of these shares.

Don’t worry, we will go over the easy way to create 
financial models and value companies in a future 
chapter using Microsoft Excel. The fun thing about 
finance and math is that there are multiple ways to 
value companies and model companies. More on 
that later. Finance isn’t hard when you slowly build 
on basic math and layer more stuff on it over 
time….you’ll see.

Oh no. We have an unfortunate set back with our company….don’t worry as Giancarlo will be 100% ok: 
www.tiny.cc/chris52   
   
 
Companies tend to overestimate what they can accomplish in a year but they underestimate what they 
can accomplish in a decade. We always know in venture capital that the companies that we invest in are 
often dramatically different by the time we harvest the investment. This is why we invest in superb 
managers/athletes. Giancarlo is the best athlete for our hypothetical P.O.S. company.  
   
 
We went through a set back and unfortunately we need to raise more money 
way sooner than we expected. Remember that cash is always ‘king’!

When Giancarlo did the A round with Sequoia he was so confident in his P.O.S. company that he made the 
terrible mistake of assuming that he would never need to raise money again until the IPO in 5 years. To 
make matters even worse, Giancarlo never consulted a lawyer when he registered his company! His fiancé 
Sue Yoo is a prominent lawyer and told him time and time again that he needed to lawyer up. Even his 
best friend Benjamin Dover who is also a lawyer warned him many times. Unfortunately Giancarlo will get 
diluted….and it’s not any venture capital’s fault. It is 100% Giancarlo’s fault for not lawyering up.  
www.tiny.cc/chris53  
Giancarlo got lucky as another amazing 
venture capital firm wants to invest. 
Sequoia led the A round and Kleiner 
Perkins will lead the B. How awesome is 
Kleiner’s reputation? Legend has it that 
John Doer from Kleiner who led an early 
venture capital round in Amazon.com 
has never sold a share of AMZN and his 
return 
on 
investment 
is 
literally 
55,000%!

Ok so we are now in year 3 and Giancarlo needs to 
raise another $1mn. 
Giancarlo is a machine – he still expects to go public 
in year 5 at a $10mn valuation! 
 
 
Eesh – too bad Giancarlo didn’t talk to Sue Yoo or Benjamin Dover. He is going to get diluted. I want to 
stress that it is his fault entirely.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 115 of 384 
Sequoia is not going to get diluted and nor should 
they as they had a law firm do the paperwork on 
their end. It’s ok because Giancarlo will still make a 
lot of money but unfortunately the only way he 
could get another investor to take a risk and invest 
was if he gave up more of his equity.  
 
 
Later stage investments usually have lower return 
profiles as they are usually closer to going public. 
Kleiner expects to make 25% annually for the next 2 
years (when the P.O.S. firm will go public). Kleiner 
will put in $1mn and in 2 years expects to have $1mn 
* (1+25%)^2 = $1.5625mn 
 
 
So Kleiner will do the deal with Giancarlo if their 
$1mn buys them $15.625%. Giancarlo does the deal 
despite the dilution. He is so passionate about the 
P.O.S. market that the dilution doesn’t bother him 
too much. He isn’t in this for the money. He wants 
to put a dent in the P.O.S. market!  
 
 
Giancarlo’s ownership was 24.07% and now that he has given 15.625% of his stake to Kleiner, he now 
owns 8.4% of the company.

He still wants to keep his 2mn shares….so there are now 23.7mn shares.

My kids told me not to put this in the book. I 
presented to 2 Stanford MBA classes recently and 
only a few students in one of the classes politely 
laughed at this pie chart. Come on I thought this was 
a bit funny!  
Ok hopefully you laughed a bit there! Back to our 
math...employees need to be incentivized to stay at 
Giancarlo’s awesome P.O.S. firm!  
 
 
 
Unfortunately Giancarlo never hired a lawyer and forgot to given then options….. 
Well unfortunately Giancarlo will get diluted for a 3rd time now! He needs to give 6% of the firm to his 
employees to keep them hanging around. They are worried as the firm almost ran out of money. He is in 
good company as this has happened to many amazing firms, including Oracle in the early 90s! Ok now 
Giancarlo only has 2.4% ownership!

Giancarlo is now on top of the world again as his company went public at $10mn and was a 10 bagger in 
the first year post IPO and a 10 bagger again in the next year and YES a 10 bagger again in the 3rd year! 
There is a reason Sequoia and Kleiner backed him! Giancarlo did such an amazing job that the board even 
granted him lots and lots of options. The firm is worth $10bn and Giancarlo owns 10% of it! A happy ending 
as he knocked it out of the park! www.tiny.cc/chris54  CURTAIN CALL!!!!

In VC, a unicorn is a VC backed company that has a private or public market valuation of at least $1bn. The 
probability of this occurring is <0.07%. Most VC investments are black holes or fims that are walking dead.

The most successful entrepreneurs are exceptionally confident. They didn’t always start out this way, but 
over time they learned to develop confidence and eventually learned how to stay in this peak mental 
confident state, especially when presenting in business.  
Whether or not you think you can do it, you are right! www.tiny.cc/chris56  
 
UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE EASY WAY 
 
Ok. Next topic we will discuss is financial analysis and accounting.  
   
 
The first time I took accounting during my undergraduate business degree at McGill University, I got a D 
and I had to retake the course. Why did I get a D? Because I was fresh out of high school and I did well in 
high school because I memorized stuff. In university and in business, you need to understand concepts, 
not memorize them. As such, I want you to understand finance and accounting concepts. Understand why 
math formulas are the way they are in finance and accounting and I promise you that you will excel and 
enjoy the finance and accounting process.  
Your company is getting closer to an IPO. In addition to Point of Sale Terminals you decide to start also 
selling watches. “Banana Watch” is your product. You want to sell them in all 50 states in the US.

There are 3 financial statements we need to understand. Don’t worry, we won’t go into too much detail. 
Why? Because we use software in this century to actually create financial statements for us! That’s right 
the Internet and software programs do accounting stuff for us. Heck if we don’t call taxis to pick us up this 
century but we use Uber, then why can’t we also simplify the accounting process? We will. In fact, I don’t 
want you to create financial statements ever again after reading this book. Instead, find your favorite 
software package like QuickBooks from Intuit and just insert “money spent” and “money not spent” into 
those programs! I told you this is a modern business book! 
As with all concepts in business, understand why they are called what they are called! Say what Chris? 
There are 3 financial statements we will learn aboooot (my Canadian again for about). They are as follows:  
1: ‘Balance Sheet’: think of an old scale that balances stuff….this tells you what you own and who owns 
that stuff (you, your investors or a bank). 
2: ‘Income Statement’: this tells you how much money or income you make after you subtract the money 
it cost you to sell a product or service.  
3: ‘Cash Flow Statement’: for some reason the income statement records expenses that you deduct that 
aren’t cash out of your pocket expenses. Why? It’s cool because it does this to make sure you pay less 
taxes. Huh? Well if you buy a car and it starts getting old, then you can ‘depreciate’ it so you can deduct 
part of the wear and tear of the car to reduce how much tax you have to pay. Don’t worry, we will cover 
all this stuff in a bit more detail. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 129 of 384 
 
BALANCE SHEET 
 
   
 
 
Why is it called a balance sheet again? Because stuff you own is owned by you, an investor in your company 
or a bank. Why do I even need to care about the balance sheet anyway? Because it tells you exactly what 
you own and who else owns your stuff. The left side of the balance scale must equal the right side of the 
balance scale. Why? Because someone owns all of the stuff in your company – it’s either you or your 
investors or a bank. The balance sheet keeps track of who owns stuff! 
 
   
 
 
On the right side of the scale or balance sheet is the offsetting or balancing side. The right side is just telling 
you who owns your stuff….it can be you or other people (including yourself) or banks/companies that lend 
you money like credit card companies etc.  
There is a left side and a right side of the balance sheet. The left side is stuff you own. This is called ‘assets’. 
Capiche? 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 130 of 384 
 
On the right side of the balance sheet you have 2 
claims or 2 groups that claim they own your assets. 
The first group is called liabilities or banks (and other 
groups) that you owe money too. So liabilities is 
people you owe money to and includes your 
employees or credit card companies etc.  
Well the banks don’t own all of your stuff. Credit 
card companies don’t own all of your stuff either. 
Say you buy a car for $10k with a $10k bank loan. 
The $10k car is an asset which you put on the left 
side of the scale. Then in order to make sure the 
scale remains balanced, then on the right side you 
include the bank loan for the car. The scale always 
has to be balanced because all of your stuff is either 
owned by people you owe money to or people that own your company (including you). Chris why is this 
statement even necessary? Because you will forget who you owe money to if you don’t have a balance 
sheet. 
 
See how the left side (assets) has to equal the right side (liabilities + equity)? 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 131 of 384 
 
   
 
Let’s build on this concept. Current assets are assets you can sell or liquidate in less than a year like cash 
or bonds you own.  
   
 
Stuff that likely takes you more than a year to sell is called long term assets, like a building which can take 
>1 year to sell. Similarly, stuff you owe in under a year like credit cards or short term loans are called 
current liabilities.  
   
 
Long term liabilities are debts that you owe in greater than 1 year like a long term loan that is not due for 
a few years. Equity is just people that own your company including you!  
 
www.ebook3000.com

Long term assets includes factories. If you can tell 
me what album cover is showed above in long term 
assets I will be very impressed!  
 
 
   
 
 
Notice how I included many banks in the long term 
section. I am not encouraging you to take on too 
much debt. Rather, if you have to work with banks 
when your company is mature, then please work 
with a few so that you can make them compete to 
give you the best rates.  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 133 of 384 
 
 
Please don’t forget that the left side of 
the Balance Sheet (Assets) must always 
equal the right side of the Balance 
Sheet (Liabilities + Equity) 
 
 
 
 
You order stuff on a balance sheet in 
the order of liquidity. Say what? This 
means the stuff that you can convert to 
cash first is listed first and the stuff you 
can convert to cash last you list last.  
 
 
www.ebook3000.com

Page 134 of 384 
In the next image of assets, obviously the first thing you would list is cash. Notice the kids playing hockey 
on the back of the $5 Canadian bill? How awesome is that!  
 
Similarly, order liabilities on the balance sheet in the order that you have to pay them back. Credit cards 
go first as well as salaries payable.

What the heck is this lease stuff? I don’t get it. 
You lease something for accounting reasons. Huh? 
Well think of it like renting a machine. If you don’t 
have enough money to buy a machine then you can 
lease or rent it.  
 
 
 
 
INCOME STATEMENT 
 
 
Recall that a balance sheet just tells you who owns your stuff (a bank or people that own part of your 
company., including you). How do I keep track of how much money I make and how much I need to pay in 
taxes? The answer is through the income statement…..the statement that explains to you how much 
income you make (and how we can pay as little tax as possible….great now the IRS is going to fn audit me)! 
The income statement has 2 sections: A and B. A is the amount we sold our banana watches for. B is the 
cost to sell those bad ass watches! A – B = our Net Income.  
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 136 of 384 
 
Let’s walk through an income statement. At the top is always sales (which is the same thing as revenue). 
Accounting and finance nerds call this the ‘top line’. They say stuff like “what is my top line growth”. This 
means how fast is my revenue (or sales…same thing) growing. Then the bottom of the income statement 
is called net income or ‘the bottom line’ [of the income statement]. Accounting and finance nerds will say 
“what is my bottom line growth” which just means how much is my net income or profit (same thing) 
growing. The top line is at the top and the bottom line is at the bottom. Easy.  
Sales minus the cost to make that product is called “Gross Profit” as dumb as that sounds. So with our 
banana watch, the cost to make that product includes the cost of all the little components inside of the 
watch.  
Hold on a second. How do we ‘account’ for other expenses in our company like salaries and rent etc.? Well 
this is recorded after ‘Gross Profit’. The cost of paying employees or research and development or rent or 
other stuff are the expenses you have associated with ‘operating’ your business. Ok so we will call these 
expenses ‘operating expenses’. If you deduct the cost to operate your business from Gross Profit, then this 
is called ‘Operating Profit’ or E.B.I.T. EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes.  
Why the heck do we have to learn about EBIT? This sucks. Why don’t you just look at net income? Because 
all companies pay a different tax rate and have different interest amounts. Therefore we might want to 
compare our company to our competition or other companies that are similar. We know that their 
expenses are similar but their tax or interest they pay are all massively different. Huh? Well we have a few 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 137 of 384 
competitors in Switzerland that claim that they make better watches than we do (what the heck do the 
Swiss know abooot watches anyway?). The tax rate is way different in Switzerland. We have a potential 
investor in our company that is also an investor in a few Swiss watch companies. He is looking at our 
financial statements now and he wants an “apples to apples” comparison of our company to the Swiss 
companies. Ok cool – he will compare the EBIT of those companies to our EBIT because the tax rates are 
wildly different for different companies.  
For some dumb reason, expenses below EBIT (also called Operating Profit) are called ‘below the line items’. 
These items include taxes or interest. Once you deduct taxes and interest payments (or interest income) 
from Operating Profit (also called EBIT), then you get the bottom line, which is called Net Income or Net 
Profit…..think if this as Profit or Income ‘net of all expenses.’ 
Cool. I get it. So I see that our net income is $30k.  
 
No our cash balance doesn’t go up by $30k. But Chris you said our net income was $30k so of course I have 
$30k more now right? No you might have more than this (or less)!!!! How awesome. Pennies from heaven!   
www.tiny.cc/chris58  
On our income statement there is $2k in ‘depreciation’ (also called wear and tear) that we paid….but wait 
we didn’t actually pay. So we have more than $30k? Maybe…

CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
 
 
All we really care about is cash in my hand and cash out of my hand….heck let’s just let software figure this 
out for us. We will….but I want you to understand accounting and finance with our very last financial 
statement, called ‘The Cash Flow Statement’.  
 
 
Cool. Ok so the $30k in our income statement isn’t our new cash balance? No. Let’s start the Cash Flow 
Statement by trying to find out what our cash balance should be. Actually there are 3 sections to our Cash 
Flow Statement. Let’s start with understanding how much cash we made or lost while ‘operating’ our 
business. Let’s add back or deduct cash items that helped or hurt our operations. Let’s call this section 
“Cash Flow from Operations.” At the top of this section we always put in net income.  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 139 of 384 
Let’s add back the wear and tear on our equipment 
that we deducted in our income statement. This is 
called depreciation and we get to add it back to our 
cash flow statement because we never paid $2k 
out of our pocket! Why did we deduct it then in our 
income statement? Because the government 
wants you to invest in your company through 
having the most bad ass and newest equipment. 
The government incentivizes you by letting you 
deduct the wear and tear from your pre-tax 
income so you pay less tax!  
 
 
 
 
 
From the assets section of the balance sheet we saw 
an item called ‘accounts receivable’, which is 
accounting nerd talk for money that is owed to 
us….think of it like money owed to us by a customer. 
Sometimes we sell stuff and we tell the customer, 
just pay us later or within 30 days (we are desperate 
to sell stuff sometimes). Well we didn’t get that 
money yet so we need to deduct it from our net 
income (or what we think we have for cash on 
hand).  
From the liabilities section of the balance sheet we 
saw an item called ‘accounts payable’. This means 
money we haven’t paid yet to (for example) a credit 
card company or employees. Since we haven’t paid 
for this item yet but we accounted for it, we add it 
back to our cash balance.

In fact, you always want to pay back debts as late as 
you can (assuming you don’t get penalized through 
interest payments). Why? Because in accounting 
everyone thinks of people they do business with as 
banks.  
Everyone wants to pay everyone else back as late as 
possible without incurring late expenses as this is 
always economically beneficial (you earn a bit of 
interest in the bank if you pay bills right before they 
are due).  
 
Cool. Ok so instead of making $30k in net income we 
actually made $42k from operating our business; 
this cash flow statement stuff rocks! You are 
thinking that you actually hate accounting a little bit  
 
less now (just a little bit)…..but wait, there’s 
more!!!!   
We invested in buying equipment to make our 
watches faster. This cost us $40k in cash.

We also got a loan this month so add $20k  
  ;
 
Ok so we actually make $22k in net cash.

The balance sheet told us that we already had 
$60k….no we now have $82k in cash! 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 143 of 384 
There is a link between the 3 financial statements as 
show in the previous graphic. The income statement 
talks to the balance sheet because net income is 
also in the balance sheet’s equity section. The 
balance sheet talks to the cash flow statement as 
beginning cash is on both statements. The cash flow 
statement talks to the income statement as both 
have net income reflected.  
 
 
Ok no more financial statement talk! (Yay!)  
In reality you use software to do all that accounting 
stuff for you. If you are a small firm, I recommend 
and have used QuickBooks a lot. It is so awesome as 
all you do is enter in money made and money owed 
and QuickBooks makes a gazillion financial 
statements for you! I even had QuickBooks 
automatically pay my employees and automatically 
send taxes when due at both the state and federal level! When you have a firm with a few hundred 
employees then you graduate from using QuickBooks to using NetSuite which is all cloud based. Then 
when you are a massive ‘too big’ firm, you use accounting software from a bigger firm like SAP or Oracle.

The only ratio we really care about when we start a company is the monthly cash burn rate….or how much 
cash we spend each month. Then closer to the B venture capital round when we are actually selling our 
product, then we have more financial data to analyze and apply ratio analytics to.

I know it sounds nerdy, but learn to enjoy reading financials like a good book. Looks for trends in the data. 
One data point does not make a trend, but multiple data points do…this is what Wall Street Analysts do! 
They look for trends! Fun! 
INCOME STATEMENT ANALYSIS 
 
Cool. Let’s look for trends in our income statement. It looks like revenue is growing at a healthy 25% rate 
YoY (year over year). Let’s look at everything on this income statement as a percent of revenue. In fact, 
the most important thing to keep in mind is analyzing everything in finance as a percent of revenue (much 
more on that later).

Aha! We found a number of red flags or problems with our company. Our gross profit as a percent of 
revenue was 35% last year and it is only 34% now. Ouch – our profitability on selling our stuff is going 
down as a percent of revenue. Many line items as a percent of revenue are rising. I see a lot of red flags 
here. 
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS 
 
Oh no….there are many issues with our balance sheet. Cash is down $20 but our inventory is up $110! So 
our assets are up $90 but due to an inventory spike? Recall that Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So what went 
up $90 in the Liabilities and Equity section? Well it looks like we are financing our $90 increase through a 
combination of short term loans ($20) + long terms loans ($40) + our $30 in net income. Disaster. We are 
burning through too much cash!!!!

Liquidity is a term that means how fast can we turn 
our stuff into cash…or how liquid we are. Banks and 
investors analyze liquidity ratios a lot to determine 
whether or not they will finance or lend us money.  
 
 
Recall that current assets are stuff we can convert 
to cash in less than 1 year and current liabilities are 
debt due in less than a year. Banks love looking at 
the current ratio…or the ratio of current assets to 
current liabilities. If the number is >1 then they feel 
that you can pay back your debts. Don’t memorize 
this…understand it. 
 
However, if your company has inventory (unsold products) then it’s not fair to look at the current ratio. 
Why? Because current assets includes inventory. Why should we benefit in the current ratio from a high 
current assets amount if our inventory levels are too high? 
   
 
Shute. The banana watches we just made have a massive recall! The watches don’t work if the 
temperature is above 70 degrees or under 60 degrees. Damnit we forgot to account for this when we 
made the watches! We thought people only use watches inside… 
The bank now thinks that the current ratio is misleading because of our massive inventory position given 
the recall. Well how can the bank assess our company now that the previous ratio is useless?

Oh boy, we are in BIG trouble now as the quick ratio is not more than 1. Oh no are we in trouble????

Banks will analyze your business by looking at the 
ratio of how much debt you have to your assets.  
 
 
 
Lenders also want to make sure that you have enough operating profit (also called EBIT or EBITDA) to cover 
your interest payments. Lenders want you to be able to make enough money to cover your interest 
payments many times over. EBITDA is just like EBIT but it stands for Earnings Before I Tricked Dumb 
Accountant. Kidding of course. It actually stands for Earnings Before Interest, Depreciation and 
Amortization. The A in EBITDA accounts for when you overpay for an acquisition (for example) and you 
want to depreciate it like you depreciate equipment.

Most companies end their accounting or ‘fiscal’ year 
on December 31st. However, some companies end 
their fiscal years at different times. Why? Because 
some companies started their companies in the 
summer. As a result, they start their accounting 
years then, like Microsoft and Oracle, whose 
accounting years end and begin in the summer.  
Interestingly enough, retail companies have their 
fiscal years ending in January and not December. 
Why? Because they make most of their money in 
the holiday shopping season. This is why they call it 
‘Black Friday’…because they go from losing money 
(in the red) to making money every year by black 
Friday where they are ‘in the black’.  
We need to understand seasonality too when 
making forecasts. Most companies have their best 
quarter of the year in calendar Q4 (October through December) and their lowest in calendar Q1 or during 
the summer (especially in Europe where business can grind to a halt there in the summer).

ETHICS IN FINANCE 
 
It is so easy to break the law in finance. A short quick buck is never worth it in the long run. 
www.tiny.cc/chris66 
 
   
 
I have a lot of respect for Goldman Sachs, where I worked for 5 years. I will never forget my first day of 
work there. They told us “Welcome to Goldman Sachs. You have a greater chance of causing harm than 
good to this company. Don’t ever do anything that can get you or this firm on the front page of the Wall 
Street Journal.” Then they fingerprinted us.  
If you think someone is unethical in business, avoid them at all costs. www.tiny.cc/chris67 . Raj Rajaratnam 
started a hedge fund called Galleon and he is in jail today. He is in jail because of greed and a lack of 
business ethics. He broke many securities laws and the FBI raided his company.

your integrity in business. If you think someone might be unethical, again please avoid them at all costs.

FINANCIAL CAPITAL  
 
There is a big difference between finance and accounting.  
   
 
Accounting is more focused on recording revenue that you recognized (‘accrued’) or expenses that have 
taken place.  
 
 
In finance we focus a bit more on projections and real cash earnings and real expenses.  
www.ebook3000.com

Accounting is a science. Finance is a science and an 
art. 
Accounting 
is 
quantitative. 
Finance 
is 
quantitative and qualitative.  
 
 
 
Let’s analyze the differences between early stage 
companies (‘seed’) and late stage companies (ones 
that might be publicly traded on the stock market). 
The x axis is t=time:  
The cost to raise money (i=interest) is always lower 
for a company that is mature and has been in 
business for a long time (common sense I know).  
 
Earlier stage companies tend to look at cash flow on 
a monthly basis. Companies that have been in 
business for a few years look a bit more at quarterly 
cash flow. Companies that have been in business for 
a long time often look at annual cash flow metrics.  
 
 
To state the obvious, earlier stage companies have 
much more risk than companies that have been in 
business for years.  
‘ 
 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 167 of 384 
 
 
 
Older companies have much more corporate 
governance than earlier stage companies. This 
means that they have more checks and balances in 
place like a larger board of directors who have a 
fiduciary duty or a fiscal responsibility to their 
shareholders.  
 
 
Older companies usually also have many more 
patents to protect their intellectual property.  
 
 
 
Early stage companies should NEVER use debt to 
grow. Why? Because if you miss just one payment, 
the banks don’t give a damn and they could make 
your business go belly up.  
 
 
The interest rate for companies that are more 
seasoned and want to get a loan is determined by 
analyzing liquidity risk, inflation risk, default risk and 
maturity (time) risk.

The lowest interest rate is usually the rate on US government as this entity has the lowest risk of defaulting.  
 
  
 
 
A yield curve is a chart that shows you what the interest rate is over time. Let’s build one from scratch:

Great. Now we know how to calculate what government interest rates will be over time. What about 
inflation? We can calculate it online:  
www.tiny.cc/chris69  
 
   
 
In 2014 per the previous image, I saw that we were temporarily in a deflationary environment. Wow! This 
is a big deal. Why? Because governments only raise interest rates if the economy is doing well. In fact, until 
recently interest rates had not increased for literally 9 years! From 2006 until 2015 rates were declining 
and near zero as the global economy had anemic growth.  
Why does this matter? Because you need to understand global macroeconomics in order to understand 
what interest rate you will be getting. If the economy sucks, rates are usually low. Why? Because the 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 171 of 384 
government wants to encourage economic growth by having low rates so companies will borrow and 
invest in growing their company.  
When the economy is doing incredibly well, then demand for goods and services is high and, as a result, 
prices go up. This is called inflation. In an effort to cool down the economy, the government likes to raise 
rates so that prices don’t go up much. They raise rates so that they can later cut rates if the economy is 
not doing well.  
What does raising rates really mean? Well the government raises interest rates by selling bonds to the 
public. By selling bonds to the public the public gives the government money, in exchange for a piece of 
paper saying that the government owes the buyer the money back plus interest. The government then 
takes this money out of circulation. If there is less money out there, then demand for money goes up (or 
the money supply goes down), which means the interest rates banks charge for borrowing money goes 
up. This is called supply and demand. I won’t nerd out on economic stuff, but just keep in mind that if 
there is a scarcity of a product like diamonds, then the price of that product goes up. Just like with money. 
If there is less money in circulation, then the price of money goes up. This means demand for money goes 
up as the supply decreases and, hence, the interest rate rises for borrowing money.  
You need to understand these concepts because one day you might borrow money to buy a house or to 
expand your business empire. Let’s talk about what happened in 2008. We were literally 24 hours away 
from bank machines not working then! 
 
I recommend that you all watch the movie “Too Big 
to Fail”.  
www.tiny.cc/chris70  
www.tiny.cc/chris71  
 
 
Fortunately, reckless unethical business practices 
that pushed us into the “great recession” in 2008 
will never occur again.  
 
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 172 of 384 
 
Up until recently, deflation was flat or even slightly negative!  
   
 
Because rates are so incredibly low, housing prices 
are high. Why? Because you pay next to nothing for 
a loan. The government tried to save the economy 
by making rates (or the cost of capital) very low. As 
a result, people borrow money to invest in houses 
or less liquid venture capital investments etc.  
Business is highly cyclical. Once rates rise a bunch 
(and they will one day), then people will prefer to 
keep money in the bank as rates are higher and they can make money on the interest rate that the bank 
is providing them. As a result, fewer people will buy houses or invest in illiquid investments when rates go 
up a bunch.  
Recall that we calculated using the yield curve that the cost of capital (or interest rate) is about 0.24%. This 
doesn’t mean that you can borrow from the bank or the government at only 0.24%. Why? Because the 
lender needs to account for the risks associated with lending to you or to a company by looking as various 
risk factors, including liquidity risk, inflation risk, default risk and maturity (or time) risk.

This is all a bit complex and theoretical. Don’t worry, 
you don’t need to memorize all of this. Give me a 
few slides to explain why.  
 
 
IBM is a mature company with a long history and a 
decent balance sheet. They are fiscally conservative. 
How can we tell what interest rate they should pay? 
 
 
 
 
Well we can look at IBM’s yield curve! We can even buy bonds from IBM and they will pay you an interest 
rate in return that is higher than the US government’s rate as IBM has a higher risk of defaulting than the 
US government does.

In the 1990s an amazing thing happened. We had amazing economic growth and interest rates were low! 
Why? Because even though demand for goods and services were high, inflation was low! Why? Because 
in the late 1980s the Berlin Wall fell and all of this awesome cheap and brilliant Eastern European labor 
moved west into first world countries. As a result, the cost of labor didn’t rise much. Labor is the biggest

RISK AND RETURN 
 
 
Remember all that standard deviation statistics crap 
you learned but never thought you would ever apply 
in real life? Well now we can! Lenders like to lend to 
firms that have lower risk or have a lower standard 
deviation. When we look at stocks and we calculate 
what they might make us, we call this the ‘expected 
return’ which is the return % we expect to receive.  
 
However, when we analyze a lot of data, we find that some stocks go up and down a lot more than others. 
This up and down movement is called volatility and the standard deviation measures the magnitude of 
this up and down behavior!  
Again, this up and down behavior is a measure of risk.  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 177 of 384 
 
 
If I tell you that a stock has an average or ‘mean’ return to investors of 20% with a standard deviation of 
31, then this means that 68% of the potential returns on investment in this stock will be 20% plus or 
minus 31%. So the stock that returns 20% has a risk or 1 standard deviation probability of making you 
51% or losing you 
11%. One 
standard 
deviation means 
68% of all data 
points are within 
the average plus 
one standard 
deviation. Now 2 
standard 
deviations means 
that 98% of your 
data points will 
lie within 2 
standard deviations. This means that 98% of our investment scenarios will return up 20% +/- 62 (or 31 
times2). You always want the standard deviation (which  measures risk) to be as low as possible.

COST OF EQUITY CAPITAL 
   
 
The beta means how volatile a stock is relative to the market. We will cover this later in this book in much 
more detail.  
   
 
I am not going to go into too much detail on this concept yet because reality is much different. As most 
investors calculate the interest rate in debt instruments using 3rd party companies like Moody’s or 
Standard and Poors. When it comes to equity investment returns, many venture capital firms look for a 5 
x 5., which means that they would like the underlying investment to return 500% within 5 years. Why so 
high? Because many venture capital investments go to zero.

LATE STAGE INVESTMENT ROUND 
We are going to do our last venture capital round now before our IPO. We will work with a late stage 
company and eventually a venture debt company. Prior to our IPO and last round though, we should 
complete a detailed model on our company and come up with an appropriate valuation. We re-engineered 
our product so we are now selling supercomputers and not P.O.S. or banana watches anymore (remember 
our awful recall issues)! These computers will sell for close to an ASP (average selling price) of $100k each. 
The software that runs on these bad boys is off the charts awesome! This last pre IPO VC round valuation 
might be around $350mn….we are close to signing a term sheet with a superb late stage VC firm. Fingers 
crossed…!  
   
 
We need to project our financial model for 3-5 years. Creating financial forecasts is a lot of fun and it was 
easier than you think! Wall Street analysts call projections “pro forma”.  
   
 
 
That’s right – ideas are commodities and there is no 
point ever making a model if you don’t have the 
right management team to invest in. As a result, all 
financial modeling done in this book assumes that 
you are happy first of all with the management team 
that you are investing in.  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 185 of 384 
 
Fortunately our management team is off the charts awesome! The company is relatively new but they are 
already on a run rate to make $1mn in revenue this year.  
In the previous company that our founder founded, he got the company from founding to $300mn+ in 
revenue in 3 years! He is a rock star! He thinks that he can get to $500mn in revenue in 3 years with this 
company. 
   
 
Recall that the T.A.M. stands for the total addressable market. We will never invest in a company that 
doesn’t have a T.A.M. of at least $20bn. Fortunately the T.A.M. of this company is $50bn!  
 
 
The founder tells us that he thinks the company can 
get 10% market share in 10 years or $5bn in revenue 
in 10 years. Wow!

We always start our financial models with sales. 
Remember that modeling is easy as everything 
becomes a percent of revenue (remember that sales 
is the same thing as revenue) 
 
 
 
 
The market size is $50bn and our guy thinks he will 
get 10% of this market in 10 years.  
 
 
 
The average selling price (ASP) of the product is 
$100k. Revenue divided by the ASP  = 50k units sold 
in year 10. Remember we are spending the bulk of 
our modeling time on figuring out what revenue 
will be. Then almost every other line item in the 
model becomes a percent of revenue.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book

His forecast of $500mn in revenue in year 3 seems too high to me; let’s haircut it and assume it is $400mn.

Spend a lot of time on forecasting revenue. I often spend a whole day doing this….then I sleep on it and 
revisit my model the next morning.  
 
When we create financial models, we make many assumptions. Please document all of them per the images in this 
chapter. You can enter comments in each cell (the yellow boxes) or you can just type your assumptions in your 
spreadsheet. If you are working in groups modeling a company (which happens often in the asset management and 
investment banking business), make sure to enter your name at the beginning of each cell comment. When I used 
to be a software engineer, I would add many comments to my code…this helps a lot when you revisit your model or 
code in the future.

Ok this feels much better. Growth has slowed a lot 
by year ten. Ok let’s use this for revenue. Now the 
easy part… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cool. Ok let’s copy our revenue column and past 
special and transpose it to a revenue row in a new 
tab in our spreadsheet.

Again, remember to add many comments to your spreadsheet. The comment above reminds us that we 
think that $350mn is more accurate for our revenue estimate in year 3.  
Wow – lots going on here….let’s take a break and watch this incredibly important video: 
www.tiny.cc/chris75  
 
 
Recall that COGS is the cost of goods sold. You can 
ask the founder or their CFO to help you construct 
the expense line items. Alternatively, you can go to 
www.sec.gov and find financial statements for 
companies that are similar to this company and find 
out what the percent of revenue was for each line 
item in the early years for their company.

This modeling trick will save you a lot of time: highlight the sales or revenue row and then rename it ‘sales’, 
which you can see in the top left hand corner of the previous image. Going forward, don’t worry about 
referring to row 5….just call it sales in your formulas!  
 
 
 
Cool beans! We are making progress. See how S&M 
(sales and marketing) is 25% of revenue and 
improving to 20% the next year?

Alrighty then we are getting there. Let’s now do the ‘below the line’ items 
 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 195 of 384 
'
 
Sweet nectar we are done! Note that we are not paying any tax in the first few years as we are not yet 
profitable.  
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 196 of 384 
See how easy the rest of this income statement was!  
   
 
Now that we are done with the model we can ask ourselves if the $350mn valuation of the private 
company we just invested in is attractive or not?  
 
Since the stock market is valuing similar companies 
to ours that go public at close to 10x’s revenue, 
then is our company cheap or expensive at a 
valuation of $350mn? I would argue that it is a 
damn bargain as we will go public in a few years 
when revenue is higher than $400mn annually….. 
which means that 10x’s revenue over $400mn 
implies an IPO valuation of way over $4bn, which 
means that we have more than a 10 bagger here!  
 
Woohoo! Yeah! Can you feel that!!!!!! www.tiny.cc/chris76 
 
Value investors suck at tech so we will only stick 
with appeasing our growth investors. You are either 
a growth investor (meaning you don’t mind paying 
high perceived near term valuations as a company 
will be uber profitable in the future…like Amazon or 
LinkedIn)…..or you are a value investor and you like 
companies that have low price to earnings ratios, of 
which there are relatively few that are relevant in 
tech.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 197 of 384 
 
 
Assume we are in 2015 today and we will go public in 2020. Assume that the market will pay 10x’s revenue 
for a high growth company like ours. Cool as this means that our company can be valued at almost a $14bn 
market cap by then. Value investors (who again suck at tech investing) will argue that they should pay 10 
times earnings on our earnings estimate in 5 years. We think we can make about $500mn in net income 
in 5 years to those investors would pay 10 times’ earnings or about $5bn. Either way, we are looking to 
make a damn impressive return 
on investment in our company!  
Wait a second…..10x’s revenue 
is what investors pay in a bull 
(or 
great) 
stock 
market 
environment. 
Ok 
let’s 
be 
conservative and haircut our 
target 
price 
for 
both 
methodologies by say 25%. 
Let’s 
be 
even 
more 
conservative 
by 
taking 
an 
average valuation of the growth 
investor’s math and the value 
investor’s 
math. 
This 
very 
conservatively 
values 
our 
company at over $4.8bn, which 
is still a hefty 14 bagger return 
given our $350mn investment.  
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 198 of 384 
Wait a second. Is our revenue multiple estimate too high? Well we can compare our company to other 
amazing high growth tech companies to compare for a sanity check.  
 
We see that Salesforce is trading at close to 9x’s revenue 
and its growth rate is way lower than our firm. Even if you 
think Salesforce is overvalued, you likely see tremendous 
value in our investment (there is a cloud software 
component to our business model too which is why we 
compare it to Salesforce’s valuation).  
‘
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 199 of 384 
Heck our growth rate in 2020 is 40% which is likely at least 2x’s higher than Salesforce’s growth in 2020. 
So if we apply a 9x’s revenue multiple on 2020 revenue, then our return on our $350mn investment is off 
the charts!

98%:  
 
www.ebook3000.com

Ok note how Sales and Marketing (S&M) as a percent of revenue is 15%? Let’s decrease this to 14% and 
see what happens to our YoY (year over year) net income growth. It should increase from 98%.to…. 
 
Holy leverage! Wow – our net income growth increased from 98% to 115% year over year by tweaking our 
Sales and Marketing as a percent of revenue from 15% to 14%!!!! Leverage is a beautiful thing.

Always do your own research. Always do your own due diligence. Everyone else has a bias and they want 
to influence your opinion. Please please please don’t let anyone rent space in your head. Do your own 
work.

You need to understand why companies do what 
they do (‘market signals’). Why is Oracle buying a 
massive tech company every year? Because the 
company is so big that organic revenue (its core 
competency) is actually contracting! Others will tell 
you otherwise. Just do your own research.  
Don’t rely on people that seem to speak gooder 
than you do : )  
 
Every financial model that you create when 
analyzing a company is different as different 
companies have different revenue drivers for your 
model.  
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 214 of 384 
 
In technology investing, balance sheets aren’t 
usually too relevant as most technology companies 
don’t have massive debt positions (you don’t need 
factories to sell software on the Internet). We tend 
to analyze deferred revenue a lot with tech 
companies. What is deferred revenue? It is revenue 
that you can’t recognize today. Huh? Well you can 
only account or record revenue on your income statement when you get the benefit of selling the product 
in this financial period. Huh huh? Well if you sell 1 years worth of software today and your customer will 
pick up only 1 box of software this quarter and will come back to pick up the other box next quarter, then 
the box not picked up becomes deferred revenue so that you can only account for it in next quarter’s 
financial statements (and not in this quarter’s financial statements). Until then it is a liability on your 
balance sheet. Once you recognize it in your income statement then it is no longer a liability.   
 
Since tech companies don’t usually have much debt, 
then cash flow is usually very close to net 
income…..so we don’t have to bother creating a 
cash flow statement! Yep that’s right.  
 
 
You always want to model at least 5 years into the 
future. Ask yourself this basic question before doing 
any due diligence: “In 5 years is this company going 
to be more relevant or less relevant that it is today?” 
If you do this then you will make a killing owning 
companies like Amazon or LinkedIn and not lose your 
short shorting these companies in a bull market! 
Huh? Well in my LinkedIn financial model, I can get 
to $50 in earnings in 5 years so LinkedIn’s stock is 
only trading at 5x my 5 years earnings per share (EPS) estimate and is a bargain! Well if I looked at LinkedIn 
and Amazon on this year’s earnings (bad idea) then I would think that both companies are ridiculously 
expensive.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 215 of 384 
If you are valuing non tech companies, you still want 
to look 5 years out but you might be more inclined 
to make a discounted cash flow analysis instead of a 
p/e or p/sales based target price.

Questions Based on Chapter 10:  
1: When doing due diligence on a company, it’s important to: 
a) Do your own research and form your own opinion.  
b) Listen to the experts because their opinion becomes your opinion. 
 
2: Value investors only buy expensive stocks.  
True    or    False 
 
3: The best investors value companies based on estimates in 5+ years. 
True    or    False

Don’t send in your resume anymore. Huh? It’s too competitive and you have similar chances of winning 
the lottery. You need to set up many informational meetings using LinkedIn.  
 
Every year I tell my students during the first day of class that I could guarantee them a job if they do 20 
informational meetings with strangers at firms that they want to work for during the school semester. I 
ask them all who would do this if I would guarantee that you got the job of your dreams? Of course every 
single hand goes up! Then during the last class, I ask how many students actually did this? Usually only 1 
or 2 hands go up and these students always get a great job! They are never the top students in the class 
either. Remember the Steve Jobs video. If you want something in life you need to ask for it! Ask and you 
shall receive.

were born in the US) are the most confident and with confidence comes the ability to sell yourself, raise 
money, reinvent an industry….etc. Please read the section on confidence in the last chapter of this book

BUILD FINANCIAL MODELS AND VALUE COMPANIES THE EASY WAY 
 
 
BREAKING NEWS!  
Microsoft’s investment bankers just 
approached us and Microsoft might want to 
buy our company! We need to decide if we 
should do an IPO or just sell to Microsoft!  
 
 
 
I created an online version of this chapter as well at: 
www.tiny.cc/chris80  
 
In the previous chapter we modeled and came up with the appropriate valuation for our 
private company. We will be going public soon and we will discuss the entire IPO process. 
Before we do so, let’s discuss how to value and model Microsoft, a company that is 
already public. 
We will make the process very easy to understand! In fact, we will make this chapter more 
Pinterest like versus previous chapters where we covered the basics of valuing a private 
company. The difference here is we have WAY more information available!

Stocks usually trade near their earnings growth rate. 
Huh? Well if a company’s earnings are growing 20% 
next year, then the stock should trade at about 20x’s 
that year’s earnings at that point in time. If a 
ocmpany is growing at 8% earnings, then the stock 
should trade at about 8x’s that earnings number 
that year. Simple enough eh!

The WACC stands for the weighted average cost of 
capital….basically what is the cost of renting money 
for Microsoft. Note: it will be a heck of a lot less than 
for a private company as Microsoft is pretty stable. 
We then use the WACC to find out what Microsoft’s 
future net income or cash flow is worth today 
(rember that a dollar in the future is worth a heck of 
a lot less than it is worth today…..the trick is to find 
the right WACC to discount future net income or 
cash flow to today).  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 263 of 384 
   
 
Rmember tech firms don’t usually have much debt. If they have some then deduct the debt from your 
target market capitalization (after accounting for the cash balance)…..I know that this is not an exact 
science but it is close enough for government work! With Microsoft I am bearish on the company longer 
term as the founders don’t run the company any more so I will just assume that growth will be anemic and 
they will use their cash balance to keep buying back shares.  
   
 
Let’s just assume that the stock market goes up about 12% per year. Microsoft is likely to grow slower 
than the stock market in the long run and it is likely less volatile as it is a stable old company….so I expect 
the beta to be less than 1. The market’s beta or volatility is 1. Your stock is either more volatile (meaning 
higher beta and riskier) or less volatile than the market (meaning lower beta and less risky than the 
market).  
 
 
You can find a company’s beta at Yahoo Finance or 
any good finance website. In fact, I used to pay $25k 
per year for Bloomberg’s financial data system 
when I was running my company but I ditched 
Bloomberg because you can get almost everything 
that Bloomberg provides online now for free!

Alright now we need to discount our future net 
income to today’s value. We discount next year’s 
earnings by 1 year. We discount the following year’s 
earnings by 2 years. We discount the year after 
that’s earnings by 3 years……all the way up to 10 
years from now per the discounted cash flow 
formula on the right .

What’s awesome is that we can do all of the DCF calculations using a very cool quick formula called Excel’s 
NPV formula (Net Present Value). This NPV formula needs 2 inputs: all of the future net income or cash 
flow values and the interest rate we use to discount them, which was 9.5%:

Microsoft offered us $1bn in cash to buy our 
company! Screw that though cuz we is worth way 
more than that!  
Before we talk about how Goldman Sachs is going to 
take our firm public, let’s try to understand tech 
valuations through a quick case study on Facebook’s 
purchase of Instagram:  
 
Before we jump in, let’s see what Mark Zuckerberg has to say about the acquisition: www.tiny.cc/chris87  
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 275 of 384 
 
$1bn for Instagram which had no revenue is a HUGE bargain when Facebook bought them in 2012! Why? 
  
  
 
Facebook only paid $10 per 
subscriber versus its own 
valuation of much much higher 
per Facebook subscriber!

That $1bn acquisition was very acretive per sub acquired for Facebook. Check out Instagram’s user growth:

Page 277 of 384 
Facebook had to buy Instagram and they had to buy Sequoia backed WhatsApp 
as Facebook’s growth is decelerating. Facebook is much less relevant to younger 
demographics.   
 
 
 
Facebook got another bargain by 
paying only $28 per subscriber for 
WhatsApp. This deal was “accretive” to 
Facebook’s value per subscriber.  
www.ebook3000.com

Valuing companies in the short term always 
differs based on the sector that the company 
competes in. In consumer technology, we 
look at the value per subscriber. 
 
 
VALUATION DRIVERS 
 
   
 
The hotel industry’s valuation driver is “REVPAR” which stands for Revenue Per Available Room. In the 
telco market we look at ”ARPU” which stands for Average Revenue Per User. In biotech we look at the 
probability a company will get FDA approval, which is why investing in biotech stocks is like a binary event 
at times. In the retail sector, we look at “SSS” which stands for Same Store Sales as we only care about the 
growth of each individual store on a YoY or year over year basis. This is why investors loved it when 
McDonald’s started serving food 24 hours a day or when McDonald’s started selling high margin coffee 
beverages.  
 
In the long run all we care about from a 
valuation perspective in all industries is 
earnings and cash flow.

We will ask our awesome VC investors Sequoia, Kleiner and Meritech who we should select for our initial 
public offering (IPO). They all tell us to go with Goldman Sachs as they are the best company when it comes 
to helping technology firms go public. Goldman puts together a group of investment banks to work with 
for the IPO, which is called the IPO syndicate. They do this as our IPO is going to be massive and Goldman 
wants to spread the risk by partnering with and sharing the economics with several firms. We also want 
to decide whoever does the best job of all the investment banks in the syndicate who to compensate a bit 
more so than the others. Competition is always good for us, the consumer.  
   
 
 
Investment bankers work with lawyers and create 
all the legal documents required to take us public. 
They list all of the risks as well in the legal filings so 
that our investors can’t sue us or Goldman if 
something goes wrong.  
Recall when we went to www.sec.gov when we 
were building our model we used the 10-k (the 
annual report) to analyze the company we were 
modeling. At the same website we can search for an 
“S-1” which is legal filing code for the IPO document 
that contains everything investors need to know 
about our firm in order to make an intelligent 
decision on whether or not to buy our stock in the 
IPO!  
 
Here is the actual S-1 filing for Facebook’s IPO: www.tiny.cc/chris88 . You can see that Morgan Stanley is 
listed first so they led the IPO for Facebook.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 281 of 384 
 
 
 
 
Goldman’s investment bankers work with our 
management team and advise us on how to go 
public and when to go public and who to sell our 
shares to. At Goldman there is a team called ECM or 
Equity Capital Markets that summarize the lengthy 
S-1 that the bankers created into a few pages called 
the Sales Memo.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ECM then teaches the salesforce at Goldman how to 
sell the company going public to their clients. The 
Goldman salesforce works on the Goldman trading 
floor beside Goldman’s army of traders. ECM tells 
the Salesforce what the risks are with the 
investment in our company as well as the positive 
selling points.  
 
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 282 of 384 
 
 
 
Then the Goldman salesforce calls their customers 
and market the deal to their mutual fund and hedge 
fund clients (their clients manage billions of dollars 
in retirement savings, pension fund money, 
endowment money and rich people’s money etc.).  
 
 
 
 
 
The Goldman salesforce then collects all the orders 
for the IPO from their customers and articulates the 
orders to ECM. The larger customers like Fidelity or 
T.Rowe or Citadel get larger allocations as they pay 
Goldman more via trading commissions over time. 
Some companies going public tell the salespeople at 
Goldman that they only want to participate if the 
price is low. Others say they don’t care about the 
price and they will buy a large chunk of the IPO with 
little pricing sensitivity.  
Customers know that a deal is hot if they don’t get 
the amount of shares that they ask for. When I used 
to work at a prominent hedge fund, if a salesperson 
during an IPO process called me to tell me that I 
should be happy that I got allocated exactly what I 
asked for in a deal, then I would be worried as this basically signals that demand for the IPO was anemic 
(watch out for signals)!  
ECM and the company going public ultimately get to decide which clients get which allocations. 
Management of the company going public usually wants the potential shareholders that they met with 
that have the best understanding of the business model in the long run to receive large allocations. Why? 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 283 of 384 
Because they are less likely to be tourists in the stock and panic if it goes down and sell it. Goldman will 
help the company understand which shareholders stick around in IPOs in the long run and which firms 
‘flip’ or quickly sell previous IPOs. Since companies that buy stocks have to file their long position holdings 
every 3 months or so, it is quite easy to track this information online.  
 
 
Then the traders on the Goldman trading floor 
distribute the shares to customers like Fidelity and 
the Goldman salespeople call their customers to 
inform them what their allocation was. Then 30 days 
later the Goldman equity research analyst can 
initiate coverage on the company with a Buy, Hold 
or Sell rating which is dependent of course on the 
valuation of the underlying company at the point of 
initiation.

There are so many independent variables when 
calculating a DCF, which is an issue. If I told you that 
X+1=3, of course you know that X is 2. If I told you 
that X+T+Y+Q=3, then you have no idea what X is! 
The same can be said for DCF as there are so many 
independent variables like the WACC, the Terminal 
Value etc.

We have no debt so there is no need to account for 
the cost of debt in our DCF. 
 
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
For some reason, the investment bankers think that our beta should be similar to storage company betas 
as there is a storage element to our product. Fine. We will take the average beta of a few storage 
companies and that is the beta we will use in our wacc when calculating our DCF valuation.

Ok. We calculated the average beta of companies that the bankers think are similar to us…..the average 
beta is 1.57. 
 
Our beta ends up being way above 1 which makes 
sense as we are a newer and riskier and likely more 
volatile stock, unlike Microsoft, which has a beta of 
under 1.  
 
 
Notice that our cost of capital or wacc is about twice 
as high as Microsoft’s. This is the case as we are a 
much riskier investment. As a result, we need to 
discount our future net income or cash flow using a 
much higher interest rate. This will result in a lower 
valuation than if we used Microsoft’s interest rate. 
Again, this makes a lot of sense as we are a much 
riskier investment than stable Microsoft (MSFT) is.

Comps means comparative or similar companies. We need to look at them so we can make sure that the 
financial statements we have prepared are not dramatically different. Looks like there is a company Called 
Nimble Storage, which Sequoia invested in before with an amazing management team and investment 
syndicate. We can look at Nimble’s financials to see if we are thinking about modeling our company the 
right way. As always, we get this information from www.sec.gov

www.sec.gov  is an amazing resource. We find S1 
IPO filing documents there as well as annual reports 
(called 10-k’s), quarterly reports (called 10-q’s) and 
press releases that companies much disclose (called 
8-k’s). The beautiful thing about being an individual 
investor is that we all now have the exact same 
access to information that the Fidelity’s of the 
world have as well (and at the exact same) time!

Microsoft tried to buy our company for an insulting $1bn. Oracle just approached us and is considering 
buying our firm for $10bn! Wow. Why would they do this? Is it because they are not growing anymore and 
they have to ‘acquire growth’ in order to appease concerned shareholders? Maybe they are too big to 
innovate? Tough call. Oracle needs some big time advice…. 
 
MANAGEMENT CONSULTING

Oracle (www.tiny.cc/chris89 )is one of the oldest and most successful enterprise software companies in 
the world. The company has been trying to build on its core database product for years.

opportunity for Oracle.

Oracle has been incredibly successful because of their CEO and founder Larry Ellison. You need to watch 
this video to understand his brilliant cerebral intensity: www.tiny.cc/chris92 . 
Unfortunately Larry Ellison is stepping away from managing the day to day activities of the company. Per 
my article on founders leaving a company in the last chapter of this book, I am always worried about 
investing in a tech company when the founder is not as active as she or he used to be.

Let’s look at an overview of the consulting industry:  
   
   
 
I used to work in the i.t. consulting industry at 
Accenture, which I loved! 3 projects I worked on are 
listed in the previous graphic. What I loved about 
the consulting industry is that if you hate your job, 
it’s all good as you can easily move on to another 
project in 6 months at another client site! 
Fortunately I loved every second of my employment 
there!

After each course I took during my MBA and 
undergraduate business education, I would always 
reflect and try to recall one framework that I could 
take with me for analyzing business problems. Here 
are a few:  
 
 
This is the Boston Consulting Group Framework. 
This framework helps companies categorize if their 
products or services are high or low growth and if 
they have high or low market share relative to the 
competition. Per the following slides, see if you can 
put each Apple product it the right categories. The 
categories are called: Question Marks, Stars (my 
kids tell me the Star logo is from the Mario Galaxy 
game which is a masterpiece), Dogs or Cash Cows.

Let’s see if you can place each of the Apple products in the image above in the correct Boston consulting 
Group (BCG) boxes. Again, the categories are: Question Marks, Stars, Dogs and Cash Cows. 
 
 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 309 of 384 
 
 
Another cool framework that I like to use is a SWOT analysts, which lets you categorize what a company’s 
Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities or Threats are. 
 
Here is an example of a SWOT analysis in real (sort of) life here in Silicon Valley: http://tiny.cc/chris113  
 
 
 
 
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 310 of 384 
See if you can do a SWOT analysis for Facebook. 
 
Another framework that consultants use and that I find helpful is the PLC or Product Life Cycle framework. 
Here you can analyze using time as the x axis and revenue growth as the y axis where companies or 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 311 of 384 
products are in their life cycle. The categories are Introduction Phase, Growth Phase, Maturity Phase and 
Decline Phase. Let’s see if you can categorize where the following products are in the PLC: Microsoft 
Windows, The Apple Watch (our banana watch is way better!), IBM’s Mainframe and the Tesla Model S 
car.   
 
   
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 312 of 384 
Another popular framework is Michael Porter’s 5 Forces Model, where you analyze the following 5 forces 
have on a company: Supplier Power, Buyer Power, Competition, Substitutes and New Entrants. See if you 
can analyze Apple using this framework.  
 
 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 313 of 384 
We can analyze a companies’ T.A.M. or total addressable market as well, which we have already done 
earlier in this book. We can also analyze a company’s B.T.E. or barrier’s to [market] entry. Lastly, we have 
already used the www.sec.gov website to read about a company’s or a company’s competitor’s risks in 
10-k, 10-q, S-1 or 8-k filings. The next image shows some www.sec.gov highlighted risks as filed by 
Microsoft.

Every chart tells a story. We already know that Oracle’s organic growth is negative. In fact, if the company 
didn’t make the acquisitions listed above, then actual revenue growth would be negative. The danger with 
Oracle’s acquisition strategy is that they need to make multi-billion dollar acquisitions every single year or 
else investors will catch on that they have anemic growth. It’s not their fault as all great tech companies 
get too big and it just gets hard to grow given the law of large numbers.  
Below is a 10 year P/E chart for Oracle. It looks like Wall St. is catching on as the P/E continues to contract.  
 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 316 of 384 
  
 
Oracle has many issues, which you as the consultant can analyze. There is a concern that they have way 
too much market power as many of their customers buy too much from them. We call this a ‘one neck to 
choke’ strategy as customers complain to one salesperson at Oracle if they have issues since they buy 
many products from one firm. However, this can lead to higher prices if a company has too much market 
power over customers (side note: Is Apple getting this way? Have you ever seen a product on sale in an 
Apple Store?).  
 
 
A cornerstone of this book is business ethics, which 
of course are of paramount importance also in the 
consulting industry as well: www.tiny.cc/chris97 .

you improve Oracle? What would you recommend 
they do?

HOW TO TELL IF SOMEONE IS LYING 
When I worked at a large hedge fund called Citadel, management hired 25 year CIA and FBI veterans to 
teach us how to tell if a CEO is lying to us. Here are some of the key takeaways:  
1: A liar often gives long winded answers to a simple yes or no question. 
2: A liar often does not make eye contact when answering a question and the answer contains a lie (unless 
this is their normal demeanor). 
3: A liar often puts their hand on their mouth when answering a question with a lie.  
4: A liar often shakes his or her foot when answering a question with a lie (unless they drink too much 
coffee)! 
 
Questions Based on Chapter 13:  
 
1: Companies often hire consultants because that company can’t solve complex themselves. 
True    or    False 
 
2: Positives of working in the consulting industry might include:  
a) The ability to travel. 
b) The ability to receive excellent compensation. 
c) The work can be very intellectually stimulating. 
d) All of the above.

3: S.W.O.T analysis stands for: Strengths. Weaknesses. Opportunities. Threats 
True    or    False

HOW DO I MAKE A TERM SHEET? 
 
A term sheet is a non-legally binding document that you and your investors sign highlighting the high level 
terms of an investment by the investor(s) in your company. I highly recommend getting a lawyer to draft 
all of your documents. However, if you want to know the contents of a term sheet you can make one 
yourself using an easy to follow step by step process on the web at a great law firm’s web site called Wilson 
Sonsini. This website will automatically generate a term sheet for you for free: www.tiny.cc/chris106

THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT YOU WILL EVER MAKE 
 
 
You are your biggest investment. Don’t be cheap when it comes to education and self-improvement.  
Continuous improvement is of paramount importance when it comes to your success in business or in life 
in general. 
Spend more than you think you can afford on education, including degrees, online education, books, audio 
books, podcasts etc. Whatever it takes. You do have time to read. Yes you do; you can listen to audio books 
during your commute to work or at the gym. You can also watch many online lectures. In fact, most online 
lectures are free and my favorites are inspiring Ted Talks. If you have Wi-Fi and a stationary bike at home 
you can watch online courses at www.Udemy.com or even on YouTube. 
Be a voracious reader. Read as many books as you can on successful business people and humanitarians. 
What are their secrets? Learn from them and watch your career take off. 
Follow these People... 
I have always been a voracious reader of biographies of successful people. I love learning from them. What 
are their recipes for success? How did they do it? Did they lead a well-balanced life on the road to their 
success? Although I am incredibly busy, I listen to many biographies of successful people in the car, and in 
the kitchen. 
Use Twitter to follow your business heroes. They often tweet incredibly motivational quotes that resonate 
well with me. I love their short snippets of optimism, hope and best practices.  
I find it incredibly motivating to know as much as I can about these successful people as most of them 
came from very uncompromising backgrounds. I love the poor, smart and hungry rags to riches stories. I 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 343 of 384 
feel empowered when thinking about them; there are no limits to what you can achieve. These people are 
no smarter than you are. They all have very positive attitudes, which I love! 
I Have Never Met a Successful Person With… 
You will never meet a successful person with a negative attitude. If they didn’t believe in themselves and 
in their goals, then they would never have been successful. The quintessential example of this is Richard 
Branson. I just finished his latest audio book and my goodness does he ever have an amazing positive 
attitude! In fact, what I have learned from most of the audio books that I have completed on successful 
people is that the secret of their success is that they all believe that there are no limits to what you can 
achieve! 
I have spent a lot of money on many biographies of successful people over the years and this was probably 
my best investment ever. So what is the biggest takeaway of the many biographies that I have read? How 
did all of these positive people all maintain a positive attitude with so many negative people around them? 
Their secret is that many of them believed that unjustified criticism is a disguised complement? How 
prophetic! Successful people often see criticism as a complement!  
I used to get a bit sensitive when others would criticize me in business. I don’t let this bother me anymore. 
In fact, the more successful in life you become, the more this will happen to you. How should you react? 
Well first of all I hope this happens to you more often because it is a reflection of your success. You almost 
want this to happen more often as it is incredibly flattering. Your coworkers or competitors might develop 
a very slightly condescending tone with you over the years the more successful you become as well. You 
almost want to reach out and thank them for the disguised complement! Don’t worry because maybe they 
just feel threatened by you which is a euphemism for a huge complement.  
Successful people are criticized all the time. The ones that are the happiest and have the best peace of 
mind are those that see criticism as nothing more than a disguised complement. So bring it on doubters! 
: ) 
The most important investment you will ever make is you! Be a voracious reader of published works 
written by or written on your business and humanitarian heroes. Follow their success blueprints and one 
day others will follow and read about you as part of the most important investment they ever make!

A COMPANY IS ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS CUSTOMER SERVICE 
 
 
I have never heard of anyone that had a bad customer experience with Amazon, Apple, Costco or 
Salesforce. The aforementioned companies are incredibly successful due, in large part, to a material focus 
on the customer experience. Not surprisingly, the stock market has handsomely rewarded these four 
companies over the past decade.  
Amazon is so customer focused that it will literally send you a replacement for a lost package immediately 
without ever implying that the customer is at fault. The result is a consumer experience that is so optimal 
that Amazon is the only place where many consumers decide to shop online.  
The same can be said for Apple when it comes to the in store experience. Apple employees are so 
passionate about their products that I feel like I am talking to a polite tech enthusiast in the Apple stores 
and not Apple employees! The result is incredibly brand loyal customers. When was the last time we heard 
of a consumer switching from using primarily Apple products to non-Apple products? Apple's in 
store Genius Bar customer support concept is brilliant and I can't understand why more companies don't 
do it. The result is Apple having the highest sales per square foot of any retailer in the U.S. at close to 
$5,000 per square foot per year! 
The customer experience at Costco is also superb. In fact, Costco has the best return policy in the retail 
industry. We only buy televisions from Costco given the company's multiyear return policy. Costco also 
doesn't even bother asking for a receipt when you return items (given their digital receipt policy). In 
addition, Costco has never raised prices on its fast food products; you still pay only $1.50 for the hot dog 
and drink combo, which was the same price Costco charged consumers 30 years ago! Most consumers 
don't know that you can even trade in your old consumer electronic devices at Costco and receive a 'Costco 
Cash Card' in return. A friend of mine jokes that "if you can't find it at Costco, then you don't need it!"

Page 345 of 384 
Not surprisingly, Salesforce, whose roots are in the customer relationship market, also has superb 
customer service. In fact, Salesforce is so customer focused and so transparent that the company will 
publicly disclose in real time when its cloud services are unavailable or having reliance issues. Consumer 
trust is of paramount importance as 'transparency builds trust'. For more details, please see the following 
link for real time Salesforce outages:  
 https://trust.salesforce.com/.  
How good is Salesforce's customer experience? Here is what happens when you start typing 'salesforce 
customer support' in your browser address box or in Google:  
 
 
In conclusion, a superb customer experience begets more loyal customers that will no doubt spend more 
money on a company's products or services in the long run. A superb customer experience also leads to 
higher stock prices over time. In this digital social media age, if a customer has a poor experience, all of 
their online contacts might find out about it very quickly. It can take 30+ years to build a brand and just a 
handful of poor customer experiences to destroy it; a company is only as good as its customer service.

3 REASONS TO BE LONG-TERM GREEDY 
 
 
When I worked at Goldman Sachs my mentors would always tell me to "be long-term greedy.” I didn’t 
fully appreciate it at the time but it makes perfect sense to me now, especially when it comes to investing. 
Here are 3 reasons to be long-term greedy: 
1: If you think long-term, then you can think like the founder does. 
My favorite investments are the ones run by founders that don’t care about quarterly earnings. Rather, 
they think about long-term strategies only (especially after the IPO). This is why I love Google and Amazon 
as both companies don’t really care about short-term guidance metrics for investors. I love this quote from 
Amazon's incredible CEO, Jeff Bezos: "If we have a good quarter it's because of work we did 3, 4 or 
5 years ago. It's not because we did a good job this quarter." When you invest in a company, you 
are investing in the management team. Hence, we must think like the founder does before considering 
investing. In the technology sector, if all of the founders have left the firm, then the company is not a 
worthwhile investment in my humble opinion.  
2: If you think long-term, then you can ignore irrational market volatility which purges ‘tourist investors’; 
this creates buying opportunities so that you are not fooled by randomness. 
Warren Buffet is the best long-term investor in the history of the stock market. My favorite quote of his is 
“the New York Stock Exchange is the only store in the world where consumers sell stuff when 
it goes on sale.” Brilliant! Mister Buffett also said “be greedy when others are fearful and fearful 
when others are greedy.” This is a euphemism for being a contrarian; don't buy stocks everyone else 
buys as there will be fewer incremental buyers. Being a long-term investor lets you focus on the company's 
destination and not on the path. 
3: If you think long-term, then your outlook on the company’s prospects will not be the same as 
consensus. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 347 of 384 
Before I do due diligence on any company as a potential investment candidate, I ask myself one very basic 
question: “In 5 years will this company be more relevant or less relevant than it is today?” Sounds 
pretty simple! It should be because the best investors see the forest from the trees and understand that 
investment trends last much longer than we think. I always ask myself this basic 5 year question before I 
do any due diligence on companies. 
Nobody is better at being a wise long-term investor than Warren Buffett. I remember when I was an MBA 
student at Columbia University in 1999 and Warren Buffett was teaching one of our classes on value 
investing. One of my classmates pitched a technology stock to him. He very politely interrupted 30 seconds 
after my classmate pitched the stock and said “Son thank you very much for the idea but I don’t 
have enough visibility where this company is going to be product cycle wise in 3, 5, 10 or 20 
years.” He was right as 6 months later the technology company my classmate was pitching went belly up; 
there is a reason Warren Buffett is called the Sage of Omaha. 
Mister Buffett ended his presentation to us with this prophetic investing quote: “The longer the view, the 
wiser the intention”.

WEALTH = HEALTH + GRATITUDE + HAPPINESS  
 
 
MONEY DOES NOT = HAPPINESS 
When I started my second company, I was stressed out and I took a drive alone down the beautiful 
California coast. I stopped by Carmel and I went for a long walk as I often do to come up with personal and 
professional goals. I stopped by a beautiful old church and I sat down and collected my thoughts. 
A priest was there and sat down next to me. We spoke for a while about what I was trying to accomplish 
in life. I mentioned that I wanted to make as much money as possible so that I could give my children the 
standard of living that I wanted them to have. What he told me that day was incredibly prophetic and just 
what I needed to hear: 
“Chris, 50 years from now your children will not look back on you and remember how much 
money you made. They will look back and reflect how good of a father you were.” 
I was blown away by his comment and I thanked him profusely for imparting this incredible wisdom on 
me. I now know in my heart that money does not equal happiness. Please don’t make it your primary goal. 
Find your passion in life and the money will come whether you want it to or not! Then you can focus on 
giving it away and making the world a better place. 
I have seen money destroy friendships and families so many times. Money can destroy your relationship 
with many people including your children. Give most of your money away to charities and only keep 
enough to keep your family happy as counterintuitive as that might sound. 
PERSONAL GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS 
You will be much more successful in business if you have sincere personal gratitude for what you have. 
Years ago I read The Art of Happiness by the Dalai Lama. He said that in western society people are so 
unhappy as we tend to compare ourselves to those that have more than us. By contrast, those that live in 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 349 of 384 
second, or third world countries are happier than we are as they focus on what is important in life, like 
family and friends and a beautiful day! 
If we are grateful for at least one different thing in our lives every day and help others that are less 
fortunate, then we will all lead more fulfilled lives. At night when I say prayers with my 3 wonderful 
children, I always make them thank God for something different every day. 
If we spend more time helping others that are less fortunate, we will all be much more fulfilled and we 
will be much more successful in life. 
ALL YOUR WEALTH CAN'T BUY YOU HEALTH 
If you are happy in your life personally and professionally, then you will be much more productive. 
However, in order to be happy you need to find time to exercise daily (no excuses) and focus on nutrition 
(no excuses) and get 7-8 hours of sleep per night (no excuses). 
I promise you that your productivity and level of happiness will increase materially if you exercise daily. 
Nothing is more important. Exercising daily helps you think more clearly and be generally happier at work. 
That positive attitude will remain elevated with exercise. 
The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered: 
“Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to 
recuperate health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the 
present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is 
never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.” 
Wealth = Health + Gratitude +Happiness

TURNAROUNDS DON'T WORK IN TECH 
 
 
Yahoo, Dell, RIM, HP and Computer Associates are all technology companies that are in secular or terminal 
decline as they continue to lose market share to companies like Apple, Google and Salesforce. When a 
technology company is in secular decline, then the road ahead is filled with potholes, false hope and empty 
promises. Only 1 turnaround in the technology sector tends to work each decade in the public markets. 
Last decade it was Apple only because Steve Jobs returned to the company and in the 1990s it was IBM 
under Lou Gerstner, the brilliant former McKinsey consultant.   
Once consumers sense that a technology company is in secular decline, they gradually use the product 
less often regardless of what new products are introduced by the company in secular decline. This is what 
happened with BlackBerry’s parent Research in Motion. Many executives, especially on Wall Street, used 
the BlackBerry as their very first smart phone. Then the iPhone and Android handsets were released which 
had awesome app stores, unlike the BlackBerry. Then for a while executives carried a BlackBerry and either 
an Android or iPhone device. Then executives phased out the use of their BlackBerries entirely. The biggest 
problem with the BlackBerry was that its app store paled in comparison to Apple or Google’s app stores. 
BlackBerry had trouble trying to be a decent software company as well as a decent hardware company. 
Most companies can’t effectively produce high quality software and hardware products. Apple is probably 
the only company in the world that can be a great hardware and a great software company at the same 
time. Google was smart enough to know that it is a software company and therefore partnered with 
Samsung and other hardware companies to make Android-based smart phones. Google is trying to change 
this though by acquiring hardware related start-ups including Nest while retaining some of the patents 
from its Motorola acquisition. 
The same argument can be said for enterprises; where there’s smoke there’s fire. Once an enterprise 
decides that a technology company might be in secular decline, then they no longer purchase products 
from the company. In many cases they even rip and replace the technology company’s products as they 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 351 of 384 
are fearful that they won’t be able to get the proper support for the underlying products in the long run. 
When I used to work in the technology consulting sector at Accenture as a software engineer, I would 
always be neutral when it came to the decision of which database to use and I would leave it up to my 
clients to decide. Clients would always ask me which company is most likely to be in business in the long 
run. As a result, we usually chose to deal with Microsoft’s SQL Server database or IBM’s DB2 database or 
Oracle’s database Instead of Sybase, which had a less rosy long term outlook (this was a wise choice as the 
company was later acquired by SAP). The same can be said for today when it comes to antiquated 
technology companies like CA (Computer Associates). Forward thinking enterprises prefer to use cloud-
based solutions from incredibly forward thinking companies like Salesforce.com, Workday or NetSuite. We 
all know that the cloud is the future and that the mainframe and antiquated client server products from 
companies like CA are in secular decline. 
Consumer and enterprise companies will be well served to ask themselves one very basic question before 
purchasing a technology product, which is this: “in five years is this technology company going to be 
more relevant or less relevant that it is today”. This is a simple question but it has a lot to do with 
future technology purchases. As a result, IT purchasers might decide not to use products from companies 
that have structural or secular issues including Hewlett-Packard or CA, among others. 
We can use the same logic when it comes to investing in technology companies. Technology investors 
should never invest in a company that they believe is not going to be more relevant in 5 years. This is why 
investors tend to flock to Apple, Amazon, Salesforce and Google instead of HP, Yahoo, CA, RIM or Dell 
(when it was publically traded). Quite often we see investors lose their shirts by getting seduced into 
investing in companies in secular decline because their valuations seem attractive. What we often 
overlook when chasing ‘value traps’ is the fact that the earnings estimates by Wall Street analysts for these 
companies for this year and next year and the year after are usually way too high. As a result, the valuations 
of these companies are incorrect. Investing in a technology company because valuation seems attractive 
this year or next year is not a winning proposition. 
Investors are far better served to create a financial model and value a company on earnings at least five 
years from today. Why? Once a consumer or an enterprise has decided that a technology company is in 
secular decline, it is almost impossible to convince them to go back and use the products they thought 
were once relevant. If you disagree, then why don’t we all wear fashions that were in style in the 70s like 
bell bottom pants? How many of us that used to use Yahoo as our search engine and then switched to 
Google have ever switched back to using Yahoo? Exactly! How many of us that used to use a Windows 
laptop and then switch to using a Mac have switched back to using a Windows laptop? How many of us 
that used to go to Barnes & Noble and then switched to Amazon have decided to go back to shopping only 
at Barnes & Noble for books? Lastly, how many of us print more documents using HP printers since we 
purchased our first tablet? Exactly! 
Companies that are in secular growth mode are those with superb customer service too. I have always 
believed that a company is only as good as its customer service is. The companies that are in secular growth 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 352 of 384 
mode like Apple and Amazon have the best customer service. Those that are in secular decline (including 
Comcast) have very poor customer service. Perhaps this is due to low employee morale given the difficult 
outlook for the company they work for 
Smart money investors value companies off of their earnings estimates at least five years in the future. If 
you disagree talk to hedge fund portfolio managers who have tried to short Amazon over the past decade 
because the stock seemed expensive. The smart money investors in secular growth companies love 
Amazon because earnings will be much much higher in at least five years from today. The same can be 
said for hedge funds that shorted Netflix because valuation seemed lofty. Don’t ever bet against secular 
growth companies (unless we are in a horrific bear market, in which case almost all tech stocks will fall). 
Valuing secular growth tech companies based on this year’s earnings is illogical. What matters much more 
is valuation based on your earnings estimates at least five years into the future. Many investors get 
tempted to invest in companies in secular decline given their relative attractive valuation. Most of the 
time, this is a huge mistake. Investors might be fooled by randomness and profit once or twice from this 
strategy but this is usually due to the markets rallying and all ships or all stocks rising as well. More often 
than not, investors buying turnarounds in tech are merely ‘tourists’ and give up investing after realizing 
that there are better secular growth opportunities elsewhere; they learn their lessons from ‘renting’ and 
losing money investing in the companies in secular decline. 
Given the slippery slope that technology companies face once they enter the secular decline phase of their 
life, it’s no wonder why value investors are usually not very good investors in technology companies. 
Rather, growth investors that love to invest in secular growth companies that might appear expensive on 
this year’s earnings and next year’s earnings do far better when investing in technology companies than 
value investors do. If you disagree with statement, then look at the historical price earnings chart for 
Hewlett-Packard over the past decade. Investors that argue the stock might have been cheap at 18 times 
earnings lost their shirts as price earnings multiple contraction always occurs over time to companies in 
secular decline. Investing in technology companies because you believe you will see price earnings 
multiple expansion is not prudent. All that should matter is if your estimates are higher than Wall Street 
estimates up to five years from today. 
So how do we know if a technology company is in secular decline? There are a few ways. If you notice that 
fewer people are using a technology product today than they did a year or two ago then chances are that 
the company is in secular decline. Another way to tell if a company is in secular decline is if the company 
misses several quarters in a row versus Wall Street estimates (unless we are in a recession). When I used 
to work in the hedge fund industry we would always say that software companies never miss just once. 
Another way to tell is if many employees start resigning because they are on a sinking ship. Check 
outwww.glassdoor.com and see if the employee reviews of the company they work for deteriorates over 
time. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 353 of 384 
So should you invest in technology companies that think they can improve their business prospects once 
they are in secular decline? Absolutely not. There’s usually only one company per decade that can buck 
this trend; I don’t like those odds. If a founder comes back to the company then there is a small chance 
that the company will no longer be in secular decline, but the odds are against it. When you hear Wall 
Street analysts or other pundits telling you that a technology company is a turnaround play, be very 
skeptical as the chances of a turnaround working in technology is extraordinarily low. Where there is 
smoke there is fire; turnarounds almost never work in technology.

SUCCESS = APPLE'S SIMPLICITY + INTEL'S PARANOIA 
 
 
Some of the best investments in history have had a combination of Apple’s simplicity and Intel’s paranoia. 
In fact, both Apple and Intel had a healthy dose of paranoia and simplicity under CEOs Steve Jobs and Andy 
Grove respectively, which is a winning combination. Other companies that have showed similar 
characteristics include Microsoft, Nintendo and Netflix. 
In 1997 Andy Grove wrote his masterpiece, 'Only the Paranoid Survive' which stipulated that a company 
contains the seeds of its own destruction and that success, in fact, breeds complacency. Complacency then 
tends to breed failure. As a result, companies must be paranoid in order to survive by either disrupting 
their own markets or being overly paranoid of the competition. Steve Jobs was paranoid of employees 
leaking products ahead of product launch dates and even had many secret code words for the same 
product so that he would know who leaked a product name should the press write about it. Grove was 
incredibly paranoid about the viability of his company’s business when it came to competing with the 
Japanese, who were much more aggressive with pricing. Grove reacted accordingly and reinvented the 
company in the processor market.  
Steve Jobs’ genius was the simplicity of his products’ designs and marketing efforts. He was the 
quintessential communicator and he was famous for his simple catch phrases. He believed that 'less is 
more' and he was adamant about having only one physical method for entering information in hand held 
devices, unlike the post Jobs products which are a bit more complex (including the Apple Watch which is 
slightly confusing to use at first and the stylus on the new larger iPad). In fact, Jobs believed in product 
portfolio simplicity by having relatively few products to sell. The number of Apple products that the 
company sells increased from 12 four years ago prior to the passing of Mr. Jobs to 24 today. Under Andy 
Grove, Intel created the brilliant yet simplistic ‘Intel Inside’ advertising campaign with the Intel jingle, 
creating consumer brand loyalty for a chip that consumers never see! Simply brilliant.  

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 355 of 384 
Microsoft also had a healthy dose of Apple’s simplicity and Intel’s paranoia under Bill Gates as he believed 
that Microsoft was always one and a half years away from bankruptcy. Under Gates, Microsoft simplified 
the process of using computers with the release of Windows. In the post Bill Gates Microsoft era, the 
number of products has also grown materially leading a slightly more complex product portfolio. 
Nintendo, similarly, has prided itself on very simple video game designs while being incredibly paranoid 
since its founding in 1889. For many years Nintendo has had a multi-billion dollar cash balance that many 
investors feel is unnecessary. In fact, Nintendo is so paranoid when it comes to its cash balance that the 
company could actually operate at a $250mn annual deficit for more than 35 years if needed! I met the 
CFO of Nintendo in Tokyo about 8 years ago and I asked him why they have such an enormous cash balance 
while the Nintendo Wii was a huge success. He told me that they are always paranoid about companies 
that they compete with that are much larger than they are, including Microsoft and Sony. The Wii U, which 
is the follow up to the Wii, has been such a flop that it would cause many competitors to declare 
bankruptcy, which happens often in the video game sector (i.e., Sega). I now appreciate and understand 
why the company is now in its third century of existence! 
Netflix is yet another example of a company that has embraced simplicity in all of its platform solutions 
on multiple devices while using paranoia to its benefit. Netflix’s streaming business was created in order 
to cannibalize its cash cow DVD rental business years before competing streaming devices could do so. 
Founder Reed Hastings was paranoid that his DVD rental business would not be viable in the long run, so 
he preemptively destroyed his own cash cow. Please leave a comment at the bottom of this article if you 
can think of a company that has ever reinvented itself as well as Netflix has. 
Companies run by CEOs that have a healthy dose of Apple's simplicity in its products and marketing tend 
to outperform those that do not. Similarly, companies run by CEOs that have a healthy dose of Intel’s 
paranoia withstand the test of time and remain relevant. Companies that have a healthy dose of simplicity 
and a healthy dose of paranoia are extraordinarily rare and are superb investments. Simply put, only the 
paranoid survive.

SUPERB MARKETING BEATS GREAT PRODUCTS 
 
 
Remember the days when we used to talk about the type of processor we had in our computers? Nobody 
really cares or knows anymore what processor our iPads or iPhones or laptops or Samsung products have. 
Superb marketing almost always beats great products; this trend exists in the technology sector, the 
clothing market, academics and even in politics! 
Windows 3.1 was released in 1992 and it certainly paled in comparison to Apple’s ‘Mac 84’. The same can 
be said for Windows 95. So why did Microsoft Windows have materially higher market share than Apple 
back then? One of the reasons was that Microsoft then had much better marketing strategies than Apple 
did. Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer was a marketing genius. Most people don’t realize that prior to joining 
Microsoft, Ballmer was a Product Manager on the Duncan Hines cake mix product at Procter and Gamble. 
He managed to get Duncan Hines to the #1 product in the sector by market share by simply making the 
box bigger! In fact, per the image below, Steve Ballmer made the size of the Microsoft Windows box 
exactly the same size as the Duncan Hines box which was larger than competing products! Marketing was 
a key reason why Microsoft was so incredibly successful then.

Microsoft’s marketing savvy has since deteriorated, in part, due to founder Bill Gates resigning. In fact, 
when all the founders leave a company, both the marketing and product quality deteriorates; remember 
how much more dominant Nike’s marketing efforts were prior to founder Phil Knight retiring? There are 
many examples of this in the technology sector, clothing sector and many other industry verticals. 
 
The 'superb marketing trumping great products' trend is also very much apparent in politics where the 
person that often wins an election does so because he or she has a much better marketing campaign than 
the competition does. In fact, think of most political leaders since the Nixon Kennedy’s televised debate in 
the 1960s and we might conclude that many elections around the world were won by candidates that 
had better marketing campaigns and by candidates that were more affable; the quality of their product or 
policies doesn’t seem to be the primary driver for election success. Superb marketing beats great policies 
in politics too. 
The same trend can be said for academics. In many cases, students with the top grades are not the most 
successful in life. Rather, students that have superb ‘Marc Benioff-esque’ personal marketing skills tend to 
prosper the most. Their grades (or their diploma product) is not nearly as relevant compared to their 
personal marketing skills. 
It is extraordinarily rare for a company to have a combination of superb marketing and superb products. 
When this occurs, we get companies that tend to dominate their sectors at least until the founder is no 
longer running the company. Companies that have this killer approach of having superb marketing and 
superb products almost always knock out the competition and offer superior investor returns.

LESS IS MORE IN BUSINESS 
 
President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address on November 19, 1863 on the battlefield near 
Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. This speech was incredibly powerful yet it was only 272 words! Less is more. 
Steve Jobs was the quintessential communicator and entrepreneur. He firmly believed that for a product 
or idea to be widely adopted, it needed to have a simplistic design. The iPhone and iPad have only one 
button. His presentations usually have 3 bullet points or 3 images per slide and that’s all. 
In this day and age we are so inundated with information that 140 character bottom line summaries are 
more relevant than lengthy write-ups. This is why Twitter has been so incredibly successful. The best 
business model presentations that I see as a venture capitalist have a maximum of 10 slides with only 3 
bullet points per slide; less is more works. 
Executives and potential investors have extraordinarily short attention spans in this day and age given the 
many screens that we are addicted to like smart phones, tablets, laptops, watches etc. You need to get 
your point across in as few words as possible. 
Pretend that each message that you send costs you $100 per word. With this in mind you will definitely 
embrace the winning methodology of less is more in business.

TIMING IS CRUCIAL IN BUSINESS 
 
Since I am Canadian, I have to quote the greatest hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky was 
incredibly successful not because he skated to where the puck is. Rather, he skated to where the puck is 
going to be. Companies that have incredible foresight into a market that will have an enormous total 
addressable market (T.A.M.) are essentially subscribing to Gretzky’s forward thinking strategy. This is what 
Bill Gates and Paul Allen did in the 1970s when they read the cover story of Popular Mechanics and knew 
in their hearts that there would be a day in the not too distant future that we would all have computers 
on our desks. 
The right idea at the right time is a major driver of success. Yahoo’s purchase of Broadcast.com for $5.7bn 
in 1999 could have had YouTube-like returns for investors. Similarly, Yahoo’s purchase of social media 
pioneer GeoCities for $3.6bn in 1999 could have produced Facebook-like returns for investors. 
Unfortunately the timing of the two aforementioned acquisitions by Yahoo was way too early. 
The same can be said for Apple’s Newton product, which was several years too early or Microsoft’s early 
tablet computer strategy or even Oracle’s brilliant but failed Network Computer strategy in the 1990s. 
There are also so many amazing environmentally friendly clean tech companies out there that might be 
decades too early to succeed; I am certainly hopeful that they do. Timing is everything. 
I had the privilege of speaking with Silicon Valley legend Andy Bechtolsheim about the drivers for success. 
Many people, myself included, believe Andy is the most successful technology entrepreneur in Silicon 
Valley history. Andy was not only the very first investor in Google, but he was also the first employee at 
Sun Microsystems and a founder of so many unbelievable companies that are public or have been 
acquired, including Arista, Granite, DSSD etc. As I always do when I meet incredibly successful 
entrepreneurs, I ask for reasons for their success. Andy has never had a failed startup and he very humbly 
told me that timing is one of the most important drivers of success. 
Timing also matters when it comes to venture capital investment opportunities in cyclical economic 
downturns. During the recession of 2001 there was 1 notable company that venture investors felt safe 
www.ebook3000.com

Page 360 of 384 
investing in, which was Google, which went public in 2004. The same can be said in 2008 when we were 
within 24 hours of bank machines not working! Venture capital investors then wanted to back a sure thing, 
which of course was Facebook. Of course we know that Google and Facebook succeeded for many reasons, 
including brilliant management teams and execution, but timing helped them as well. 
So how do we know if our timing is good enough to succeed? It comes down to several factors, including 
a huge consumer or enterprise appetite for a product or service which can be quantified through an 
enormous T.A.M. Component or input prices for products needs to be low enough as well, which is a 
reason why Android and Apple smartphones have been so incredibly successful. Years ago I read an 
incredible McKinsey study about how all component prices in computers, phones and TVs drop in price 
close to 1% every single week! The hard part is assessing through focus groups when prices for consumer 
or enterprise products or services will be low enough to entice them to buy the products or services. 
Timing might be a bit less relevant in technology today for a reason aside from the price of purchasing the 
product or service. What I mean by this is that many technology companies are copying the magazine 
subscription business model and renting or allowing consumers or enterprises to effectively subscribe to 
use their products, which is superb from a revenue visibility perspective. A two year subscription to a smart 
phone might cost close to $1,000. By having consumers subscribe to products on a monthly basis, the 
sticker shock risk is mitigated. As a result of subscription business models from companies like Apple or 
Salesforce, timing is a big less of an issue today. 
Timing has a lot to do with success; we need to skate to where the puck is going to be in the not too distant 
future.

FRUSTRATION IS A GOOD THING IN BUSINESS 
 
 
If you have a high level of professional frustration in your life then this is a gift to you. It’s a gift to you 
because you are not professionally doing what you are most passionate about. 
It’s perfectly normal to be frustrated in business. The fun part is figuring out what you love doing in life 
and what your business purpose is in life. What were you put on this earth to accomplish professionally? 
How many lives could you help improve if you accomplished your business goals? What would it take for 
you to no longer feel professionally frustrated? 
Find humor in stressful and frustrating business situations and you will live a much longer and happier life! 
Self-deprecation is an admirable trait. Finding humor in frustration instantly changes your state and helps 
you to focus on turning a crisis into an opportunity. Rather than be depressed given a perceived failure or 
frustration, smile and cheer up because your future incredible success in business is a result of that 
failure. You will be grateful later in life that you 'failed'. 
There are so many amazing examples of executives that have failed or have been fired which forced them 
to realize their dreams by starting their own company. Frustration often leads to breakthroughs in your 
career. 
Here are some incredibly inspirational examples of people that were fired. Thank goodness they were or 
we wouldn’t enjoy the benefits of their future business empire creations: 
Tomas Edison was fired by Western Union. 
Michael Bloomberg was fired which made him get his revenge by starting his financial empire Bloomberg. 
Without getting fired he wouldn’t have ever become the Mayor of New York.

J K Rowling hated her job as an administrative assistant. She quit and found her passion, which was writing 
the Harry Potter books. 
Walt Disney was fired by a publication he worked for. 
Madonna was fired from Dunkin Donuts 
Robert Redford was fired from an oil company. 
Lee Iacocca was fired from Ford. So he turned around and led Chrysler. 
All these amazing people lost their jobs because of a lack of passion or because of frustration with their 
careers. They then became incredibly successful because they focused on their passion. 
What is your calling? What is your raison d’être? Find your passion and you will always be happy in business 
and in life. If you feel suffocated in your current job, then find your passion, write a business plan and quit.  
Frustration leads to breakthroughs. 
Frustration leads to reinvention. 
Embrace it. 
Find your professional passion and end your frustration; welcome to the new you.

SUCCEED LIKE DEREK JETER BY WRITING THESE DOWN 
 
 
A major reason for baseball icon Derek Jeter’s success in every aspect of his life was because his parents 
made him write down his goals every single year. You need to write down your goals and update them 
often. If you do, the chances of you achieving your dreams rises materially; most of your competitors won’t 
bother doing this! 
In 1953 there was a famous study conducted at Yale University. The graduating class was asked if they had 
written down their goals. Only 3% had done so. Then 20 years later, a poll was taken and the graduating 
students from the class of 1953 were asked what their net worth was. The net worth of the 3% that had 
written down their goals was greater than the other 97% combined!  
Write down your goals in your smart phone’s calendar and have this calendar entry be repeated daily. Tell 
your friends or family members what your long term goals are so that it forces you to work towards them 
and think of your goals often. Consider writing your goals down on paper and then placing them in a sealed 
and stamped envelope with your address on the envelope. Then give the envelope to a good friend or 
family member and tell them to mail the letter in 6 months or 1 year.   
Think of the most ambitious goal you can achieve in your life. Don’t ask yourself if it is achievable; of course 
it is. Rather, ask yourself what you need to accomplish in order to make this goal a reality. Make a 
rudimentary gap analysis. Once you know what your goal is then focus on filling the gap, meaning what 
you need to accomplish in order to make this goal a reality.   
When you first think of an incredibly ambitious goal, you are so fired up and excited to start the journey. 
Before you start the journey you can clearly see the top of the mountain, which is a metaphor for your 
goal. 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 364 of 384 
Once you embark upon your journey you are full of energy and excitement as with each step you get closer 
and closer to your goal. Then much later in the journey you become frustrated as you can no longer see 
the top of the mountain. As a result, your pace deviates a bit and is perhaps slower than it once was. 
You wonder what happened to my goal? Why can’t I see the top of the mountain anymore? Well the 
reason is simple; the reason is that you are half way up the mountain and can't see the top of the mountain. 
Rest assured, your goal is within reach. Finish what you started, be long term greedy and reap the 
rewards.  
Set a goal so big that you can’t achieve it until you become the person that actually can achieve it. Update 
these goals often and I promise you will wake up one day and realize that you accomplished all of your 
goals and more. 
We often overestimate what we can accomplish in a year but we significantly underestimate what we 
can accomplish in a decade. Please write down your short and long term goals and watch your career take 
off!

TECH INNOVATION THRIVES IN THE US DUE TO YOUTH WITH CONFIDENCE 
 
 
 Tech Innovation Thrives in the US Due to Youth with Confidence 
“We are witnessing the downfall of the U.S. economic growth engine as U.S. student test scores are way 
below test scores of other countries.” I have seen the aforementioned quote in countless media 
publications for my entire life, but the quote is flawed. American students, whether or not they were born 
in the U.S., are number one globally in the most crucial economic category that nobody acknowledges, 
which is confidence. Confidence leads to innovation. Innovation leads to entrepreneurship. 
Entrepreneurship leads to business models getting funded. Business models getting funded leads to risk 
taking. And risk taking leads to GDP growth. 
Most generations criticize the next generation for being too entitled or the previous generation for taking 
on too much debt. Each American generation blames the one before or makes renegade critical comments 
like “don’t trust anyone over 30!” Each generation has the confidence to disrupt the previous generations’ 
business model empires and the confidence to question authority. This isn’t just a Haight Ashbury 
phenomenon; it transcends generations. The one common link all generations of American students have 
is the ability to confidently take risk and sell the dream of global innovation or global social justice. 
The American Dream is based on the notion of confidence and innovation. Anybody can make it in America 
regardless of their backgrounds or where they were born. Due to this, there is a belief in the U.S. that 
anything is possible. Some of the best salespeople in the world were students in America regardless of 
where they were born. A great CEO is a great salesperson and a great salesperson has above average 
confidence. In all of our portfolio company investments in venture capital we look for a little bit of Marc 
Benioff or Steve Jobs, two quintessential, confident, brilliant visionaries and salespeople. Individualism 
and freedom of expression is embraced in America. Some other countries are more conformist, which 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 366 of 384 
leads to the antithesis of individualism and entrepreneurship and we hear of quotes like “the nail that 
sticks out gets hammered down.” In the U.S. failure is not shameful. Rather, entrepreneurs in the U.S., 
whether or not they were born here and regardless of their age, see defeat as merely a challenge to try 
again. 
Confidence among American students is more apparent today than ever before. It’s hard to keep track 
here in the Bay Area of the number of successful student-founded ventures over the years where a student 
creates an overnight multi-billion dollar company, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, etc. Also, with 
ubiquitous mobile broadband offerings, expect the number of new multi-billion dollar disruptive business 
models to accelerate. In addition, given the extraordinary low cost of cloud computing from companies 
like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, the barriers to entry for start-ups are also extremely low. As a result, 
it is significantly easier for larger companies to see their business models disrupted by student run start-
ups. 
Each generation is given a label from Generation X to Generation Y to the Entitlement Generation, and so 
on. I refer to the current generation as Generation C for Confidence. With confidence comes innovation, 
prosperity and continuous generational improvements in economic productivity and social justice; I 
applaud the sub 25 year old Generation Confidence, as no other generation has had the same positive 
impact on older generations as the current generation. The cynical pundits that are calling for the long 
term downfall of U.S. economic growth due to poor student test scores have flawed logic; tech innovation 
has always thrived in the U.S. due to youth with confidence.

AMAZON AWS: THIS GENERATION'S BERLIN WALL TEARDOWN DEFLATIONARY 
EVENT 
 
 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), with its ‘Walmartesque’ everyday low prices strategy, has single handedly 
altered the enterprise software pricing model and has created the most important deflationary impact of 
this century. 
The ‘old tech’ business model was to dominate an industry and then release mediocre upgrades at 
commensurate pricing points and with minimal worthwhile innovation. The ‘new tech’ model is to 
undercut the competition with material value added lower cost upgrades, which is exactly what AWS is 
doing. Amazon’s low cost strategy has influenced many technology companies to also cut prices for their 
platform solutions, including Microsoft with its competing web platform, Azure, as well as Google 
Compute. In fact, you could argue that Windows 10 will be free for many users initially because of 
Amazon’s influence. 
We are being conditioned to expect to pay nothing or next to nothing for operating system platforms. I 
can’t think of a more deflationary secular trend. 
There are so many intriguing free Internet software products available now because of Amazon and there 
are no historical industry vertical precedents. The optimist in me believes that interest rates are low in 
part due to the deflationary impact of Amazon Web Services (AWS), and that the impact of low cost cloud 
platform computing will cause many verticals and software companies to cut prices in the years ahead 
and, hence, cause interest rates to remain close to historically low levels. AWS in 2015 is this generation’s 
1989 Berlin Wall tear down deflationary economic event. 
Today, enterprise applications and operating system prices are plummeting thanks to Amazon acting as a 
price cut leader. This deflationary trend has started to accelerate as Microsoft and Google have started to 
also be price cut leaders by materially cutting the pricing points of their cloud service provider platforms, 
www.ebook3000.com

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 368 of 384 
which are the platforms that some of the most disruptive companies in the world operate on top of. New 
companies are being created like Uber that charge much lower pricing points due to the inherent cost 
savings of low cost cloud platform solutions like AWS. This deflationary trend should continue for the 
foreseeable future. Many disruptive new companies don’t use any software from old school tech 
companies like Oracle or Microsoft as there are widely available free (or lower cost) alternatives that run 
entirely on AWS. As a result, as consumers, we have so many opportunities to use technology products 
that now cost next to nothing to use or subscribe to (i.e., Netflix). 
Why was the global economy booming in the ‘90s? It wasn’t primarily because of the booming tech sector. 
Rather, it was mainly because the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and a plethora of lower-cost, high-quality labor 
was unleashed from Eastern Europe; this was the reason we had low interest rates then, relative to the 
booming global economy. 
AWS is today’s equivalent. And the technology cost savings we’re seeing today are commensurate with 
the deflationary labor cost savings in that era. Instead of the late, great Ronald Reagan prophetically telling 
Mr. Gorbachev to “Tear down this wall,” Amazon has forced the entire enterprise software market to 
dramatically reduce prices around the walled garden of ridiculously high-margin software prices. Only it 
was Jeff Bezos telling Mr. Ballmer in 2005, when AWS was released, to “Tear down this wall.” The 
deflationary impacts are remarkably similar. 
How is AWS deflationary? Your monthly cable bill is now more than 50 percent cheaper. Your hotel fees 
are more than 50 percent cheaper. Your server computing bill is more than 50 percent cheaper. The IT 
cost to start a business is now more than 50 percent cheaper. The list goes on. 
Netflix is profitable and is dirt cheap at only $7.99 per month, with superb proprietary content, because 
Netflix runs on AWS. Airbnb allows us to pay next to nothing for hotels because Airbnb runs on AWS. 
Dropbox has cut our company’s server costs by more than 50 percent because it runs on AWS. As AWS 
continues to materially cut the pricing point of its platform and applications, we can expect more 
companies to cut prices and/or new companies to emerge that compete with, and materially disrupt, old 
school companies that have dominated their respective industries for decades. It’s astonishing how much 
better Netflix’s content is today versus a decade ago when its pricing point was much higher; thanks in 
large part to Netflix running on AWS. 
Under Ballmer, Microsoft only cut the price point of Windows three times since it was launched more than 
20 years ago. By contrast, Bezos has cut the price point of AWS close to an astonishing 50 times in less 
than 10 years. 
But now, under new CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s competing product to AWS, Microsoft Azure, is not 
just a price cut follower, but also a price cut leader. Google’s superb cloud platform, Google Compute, is 
also now a price cut leader. We have three unbelievable cloud service providers all aggressively cutting 
prices. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 369 of 384 
These platforms are the most important cloud operating systems and, thanks to AWS, the deflationary 
impact of the aforementioned platform price cuts is staggering and unprecedented. This is not an irrational 
exuberance event. 
There is no historical deflationary precedent in any other industry. The impact is commensurate with Ford, 
GM, and Toyota cutting prices on cars 50 times in 10 years. Or Marriott, Holiday Inn, and Ramada cutting 
hotel prices 50 times in 10 years. Or General Electric, Sub-Zero, and Maytag cutting prices on their 
appliances 50 times in 10 years. 
In the past, companies were slaves to the enterprise software giants with their “one neck to choke” 
strategy. Conglomerates like Oracle, with their patched together acquired vertical offerings from the 
hardware layer (Sun Microsystems), to the middleware layer (BEA) to the enterprise resource planning 
layer (PeopleSoft and others), would charge hefty annual maintenance fees. Never again. AWS and lower 
priced deflationary cloud computing options have finally disrupted this model. In the years ahead, we will 
continue to see cloud service provider platform giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google continue to cut 
prices, furthering the most deflationary event we have seen since that historic event in 1989.

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY, THE REGION THAT REVOLUTIONIZES HOW WE 
DO EVERYTHING 
 
If you live in Silicon Valley, chances are that you are reading this article from your iPhone, while riding in 
an Uber car to the company you work at that holds the next world-changing technology. 
But it goes beyond the technology we see and hold in our hands and includes all the industries the Valley 
has helped flourish, providing growth for technology that shapes our lives in ways many of us not only 
don’t understand, but don’t even know. The minds and innovation that live and thrive here hold the keys 
to future technology innovation. The San Francisco the Bay Area receives more than 50 percent of the 
country’s VC funding. 
Silicon Valley offers unparalleled access to high-quality engineers, a risk-taking culture, venture capitalists 
and superb universities. But the reason this particular spot ended up at the heart of the technology 
industry might surprise you. It all starts with Sputnik. 
Americans were brokenhearted when Russia beat the United States in the space race with the launch of 
Sputnik 1. NASA was created, and NASA needed high-powered components to be developed in order to 
put the first person on the moon. Fulfilling that need was Fairchild Semiconductor, which was founded in 
the Bay Area in the midst of Cold War competition. 
The seminal event was the spark that ignited Silicon Valley’s innovative, risk-taking culture five decades 
ago and it has truly shaped the way our lives have been, and will continue to be, enhanced by technology. 
If not for Sputnik we would not have witnessed the massive technology innovations that spawned from 
Fairchild Semiconductor and “Fairchildren” companies like Intel, AMD and NVIDIA. This was just the 
beginning. A flourishing hardware industry emerged. As a result, the software and Internet industries also 
flourished. 
Bay Area innovation is changing the way we do everything – from Uber disrupting the taxi industry, to 
Twitter disrupting the media industry and Facebook disrupting the communications industry. One can 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 371 of 384 
even argue that Barack Obama is president partially as a result of embracing social media technologies 
and Salesforce’s cloud-based software for campaign management – talk about a political disruption! In 
truth, you can look at any industry that has yet to be optimized by tech and bet that in the not so distant 
future it will experience a revolution in part due to innovations from Silicon Valley. 
Think about the transportation sector, an industry that hasn’t changed much in the last half century, but 
is on the precipice of complete technological disruption. Automated, self-driving cars are something we 
already see sharing our Bay Area roads, but in as little as five years these cars will likely be broadly 
available, instituting a massive disruption in the way we commute. Longer-term, this disruption will also 
offer a sizable boost to economic growth, with the number of accidents falling because of this sensor-
based self-driving technology. 
The opportunity for mobile commerce and communication are also limitless. While these are areas that 
receive a lot of air time, it’s breathtaking to think that each of us with a smartphone holds more power in 
the palm of our hand than every computer we used to put a person on the moon (take that, Sputnik!), or 
that a child in Africa has more and faster access to information than Bill Clinton did in the 1990s. These 
revolutionary communications tools have worked to keep rogue governments in check, spurred political 
revolutions and enabled countries without sophisticated, tech-enabled banking systems to able to flourish, 
thanks to smartphone computing and the advent of Bitcoin. In short, the disruptive power of technology 
can, and will, rock every industry as we know it on a global scale. 
Still more industry-disrupting companies will be born in the Bay Area over the next decade, leveraging 
technologies via the Internet of Things (IoT) movement or, in true Valley style, creating an entirely new 
movement altogether. 
As an investor, the best investments are platform solutions because they own the ecosystem and are 
technologies that have the ability to scale and grow. Facebook, LinkedIn, eBay and even YouTube (as a 
media platform) are great examples of platform-based approaches that have scaled, with skyrocketing 
numbers of users, but also content or applications that run on top of them. It starts as one platform and 
morphs into something much bigger. The healthcare industry is beginning to see the platform tectonic 
shift that will change the way we all give and receive medical services. Once we address cloud-based 
security issues, enterprise public cloud computing will also flourish. 
Other regions have tried to emulate what the Bay Area has done with little success. The region’s 
technological prowess isn’t just due to great minds and high-quality schools like Stanford and UC Berkeley. 
If this were the case, then Oxford and Cambridge would make London a dominant tech center. Silicon 
Valley is a fertile technology crescent 50 years in the making. It is the product of Sputnik-induced 
competition, a 1960s induced cultural renaissance and an open-minded, risk-taking approach where 
failure is accepted. Silicon Valley cannot be replicated anywhere else, but the effects of its innovation will 
continue to be shared around the world.

SPUTNIK, HIPPIES AND THE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY OF SILICON VALLEY 
 
 
SIT DOWN AND talk with anyone about technology and you’ll have little trouble arguing that the San 
Francisco Bay Area is the quintessential location for tech startups. The area offers unparalleled access to 
high quality engineers, venture capitalists and superb universities. But the reason this particular spot 
ended up at the heart of the technology industry might surprise you, and it all starts with Sputnik. 
The seminal event was the spark that ignited Silicon Valley’s innovative, risk-taking culture more than 50 
years ago, and it has truly shaped the way our lives have been and will continue to be enhanced by 
technology. If not for Sputnik, we would not have witnessed the massive technology innovations that 
spawned from Fairchild Semiconductors and “Fairchildren” companies like Intel, AMD and NVIDIA. Apple, 
Google, Oracle, Uber, Twitter, Facebook and many other disruptive technology companies would not exist. 
Still more industry-disrupting companies will be born in the Bay Area over the next decade. What Uber 
has done to the taxi industry is the just the tip of the iceberg. Bay Area innovation will disrupt countless 
industry verticals with Google and Tesla disrupting the transportation industry with self-driving cars. Then 
you have Twitter disrupting the media industry; Facebook disrupting the communications industry; 
LinkedIn disrupting the human resources industry; Salesforce disrupting the political and customer 
relationship management industries; and many emerging startups disrupting consumer markets via the 
Internet of Things (IOT) movement. 
Silicon Valley has shaped our lives in so many ways that we don’t realize. One can easily argue that Barrack 
Obama is president partially as a result of embracing social media technologies and Salesforce’s cloud 
based software for campaign management. The advent of real-time data and communication allowed him 
to target specific regions for campaigning and reach out to tech-savvy voters across the country. 
We also can’t forget the incredibly open nature of the Bay Area, which has led to unprecedented sharing 
of information and empowering technologies. During the hippie movement of the 60s, Bay Area 
technology companies became more open minded and embraced the open-source movement and the 
sharing of ideas. This unparalleled culture has been critical to innovation and the exceptional speed at 
which new companies have been and will continue to be founded. 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 373 of 384 
Additionally, this open nature mentality has led to a culture that embraces risk-taking where failure is seen 
as a learning experience and — unlike in other global economic hubs — is not shameful. As a result, risk-
taking is embedded in the DNA of Silicon Valley. 
Other regions have tried to emulate what the Bay Area has done with little success. The region’s 
technological prowess isn’t just due to great minds and high quality schools like Stanford and Berkeley, 
among others. If this were the case then Oxford and Cambridge would make London a dominant tech 
center. 
Silicon Valley cannot be replicated without the 50-plus years of history it has taken to develop the ideal 
fertile technology crescent. So if you want to work in technology and change the world, move to the San 
Francisco Bay Area

WHEN A COMPANY FOUNDER RESIGNS, INVESTORS SHOULD HEAD FOR THE EXIT TOO 
 
 
Most large tech companies are no longer run by their founders. This is problematic for investors, because 
a painful corporate bureaucracy develops when a founder leaves and, as a result, risk-taking and 
innovation deteriorates. 
Any large tech company no longer run by its founder that tells you otherwise is being disingenuous to its 
investors. 
Why is this the case? Many tech companies with enormous research and development budgets can’t 
innovate as effectively as a few engineers in a garage if they’re not run by their founder. Executives who 
work at large tech firms are focused mainly on climbing the corporate ladder. If they step out of line to 
take a risk by innovating and are unsuccessful, then their careers are significantly damaged. If they are 
successful, they won’t get compensated, as HR departments refuse to materially disrupt compensation 
structures. For non-C-level executives, the best way to get compensated is to quit and join a startup or 
smaller founder-led private company. 
Founders have earned the respect of their investors. They are less exposed to the pressures of having a 
short-term investment horizon, and they can take long-term innovation risks. They aren’t subject to the 
same politics as executives at big companies, nor do they care. They don’t have a job, they have a passion. 
To quote Steve Jobs, they are crazy enough to think they can change the world. 
When a CEO founder leaves a company, passion, innovation, and risk-taking materially deteriorates, which 
obliterates shareholder value. 
But what about Google, Amazon, and Salesforce? Aren’t these enormous tech companies that are 
incredibly innovative? Yes they are, and all are still run by their founders. How are they different? They 
don’t care about short-term quarterly results; they are correctly greedy in the long term, not the short 
term.

Google is run by a founder, Larry Page, who has given engineers an incredible amount of flexibility by 
allowing them to spend 20 percent of their time on R&D initiatives that they are incredibly passionate 
about. 
At Amazon, founder Jeff Bezos doesn’t allow any meeting to take place that requires more than two pizzas 
in order to eliminate the “too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome” (otherwise known as bureaucracy). 
At Salesforce, founder Mark Benioff emerged as the quintessential cloud evangelist; I look for Mark’s 
passion in all CEO/founders that I meet with when I do due diligence on potential venture capital 
investments. (As an example, we invested in cloud company Bracket Computing partially due to the 
visionary passion of cofounder Tom Gillis.) 
Many investors believe that we are in a tech bubble. While I can’t disagree that valuations on some private 
companies are lofty, I can argue that part of the lofty valuation is due to the fact that many large-cap tech 
companies have extremely low organic growth. As a result, and due to their inability to innovate, they 
have no choice but to make many acquisitions. 
Given the large number of mature, large-cap tech companies no longer run by their founders, the number 
of expensive private market acquisitions has materially increased. The private tech market has caught on 
to this and, as a result, many tech companies are staying private longer. 
The goal of many VCs, and private companies, is no longer to have a sub-billion dollar IPO. Rather, it has 
been fruitful for VCs to encourage portfolio companies to wait even longer to go public; large-cap tech 
companies are partially to blame for current lofty valuations, which is indirectly due to the fact that they 
are incredibly ineffective at innovation. 
Does this mean that large-cap tech companies no longer run by their founders are significantly overpaying 
for acquisitions? Not necessarily, as many large-cap tech companies have more than 50 percent of their 
revenue overseas, versus many private companies that have almost all of their revenues from domestic 
sources. Small private companies are better innovators but have problems scaling; large companies are 
better at scaling but have problems innovating. 
How do we address the large company innovation conundrum? Perhaps they should emulate the 
Google/Amazon/Salesforce practices of giving engineers much more creative freedom, keeping innovation 
teams small, and ensuring that there is more evangelical passion present. 
It’s also important for large tech companies to encourage innovation risk-taking by implementing 
unlimited upside bonus structures for engineering teams, tying them to the upside success of the products 
and services that they pioneer. Otherwise, your best talent will be incentivized to quit and join a startup 
run by a passionate founder, and investors will also run for the exits.

YOU NEED YODAS IN ORDER TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS AND LIFE 
 
 
You need many Yodas in your life and in your career. You need mentors and you need to mentor others in 
order to reinforce what your core beliefs or critical career and life success factors are. 
Make sure that your Yodas (or mentors) are in a position that you want to be in one day. Are they 
successful professionally? More importantly, are they successful personally? Did they achieve a great 
work/life balance? Are some of their past accomplishments your future goals? Can you trust them? Do 
you enjoy their company? Can they offer you constructive criticism so that they can help you to seek 
continuous improvement? 
It is extraordinarily rare for an executive to rise to the top of any organization or for any entrepreneur to 
be wildly successful without many mentors. Hewlett mentored Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs paid it forward 
too by mentoring Marc Benioff from Salesforce, which is now the largest employer in San Francisco. 
Behind almost every single successful business person is a great spouse. You are a team and you have 
likely only gotten to where you are in life because of their mentoring. Listen to them and thank them often 
especially this Thanksgiving weekend as they are also one of your Yodas. I often read my emails that I am 
composing to my wife Christine before sending them. Her feedback always rocks. 
Your spouse knows what makes you happy in business. Remind them often what your business passions 
are. In return, they will remind you what you love in life and reinforce and hence help guide and remind 
you what you are on this earth to accomplish in business. What is your purpose? 
Your spouse is your ultimate confidant and life coach. Only your spouse can tell you if what you are wearing 
went out of style 80 years ago! Only your spouse can tell you that you sound too arrogant when practicing 
a corporate presentation. Only your spouse can remind you why you wanted to work in the industry you 
currently work in. Only your spouse can help you achieve your long term goals. So thank your spouse often 
as you will never get a better life coach / Yoda.

Give and you shall receive. This statement has been true since the beginning of time; those that are 
generous with their time and mentor others are much more successful than those that are not. Why? First 
of all it is the right thing to do as others helped you to get to where you are today, but by mentoring others 
you also reinforce your core beliefs and remind yourself what the drivers of success are. 
I am so honored and so humbled to be on the board of a wonderful charity called the LEMO Foundation, 
whose mission is to eradicate poverty through scholarships to those that are less fortunate. LEMO’s core 
mission statement is brilliant: “Don’t expect to accomplish your dreams unless you help others accomplish 
their dreams.” I love that; so prophetic and so true! Some call it karma and others call it paying it forward. 
Everyone should seek mentors and mentor others; you will be much more successful in the long run if you 
practice what you preach. 
People are flattered when you ask them to mentor you. They almost always say yes when you ask them. 
Ask and you shall receive mentors. They will help you achieve your goals in life. More importantly, there 
is nothing more satisfying in life than watching people that you mentor become incredibly successful. This 
is worth repeating: “Don’t expect to accomplish your dreams unless you help others accomplish their 
dreams.”

WHEN TO CHANGE CAREERS 
 
 
If you get up in the morning and tell yourself that you are going to work, then you are doing it wrong; you 
need to change careers. Find out what your passion is. Find out what you were put on this earth to 
accomplish. It certainly isn’t to make a lot of money. Don’t worry, odds are that if what you are doing in 
life is your passion, then compensation will never be an issue. What is your calling? 
Success does not lead to happiness; rather, happiness, leads to success. In venture capital when deciding 
what companies to invest in, we don’t look for founders that want to be rich. Rather, we look for 
passionate entrepreneurs that want to put a dent in the universe. This is their calling. This is their reason 
d’être. 
Don’t worry about money early in your career; if you follow your passion, then everything else will fall into 
place. Many of my business students want to become investment bankers but then they hate it and they 
are miserable once they start. Focus on what you love doing most in life. The best entrepreneurs don’t 
have a job; they have a passion. Superb examples of passionate entrepreneurs include Sir Richard Branson 
of Virgin, Mark Benioff of Salesforce, Christian Chabot of Tableau and of course Steve Jobs. The best CEOs 
and businesspeople in the world are passionate salespeople. 
What is your passion? Ask yourself this question “who is a rock star to me but is not a musician?” Sounds 
out there I know, but for me when I was younger it was Bill Gates….so my passion then as it is now is 
software! 
Don’t ever focus on money as your primary career goal or you will never have a happy existence; you will 
never feel fulfilled. Here is a wonderful quote by the Dalai Lama on this topic: 
“Man…sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And 
then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 379 of 384 
live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really 
lived.” 
Don’t have regrets later in life. Change careers if it will make you a happier person. It’s never too late to 
start over. 
Take that Walk & Ponder a Career Change! 
Some of the best decisions in life are made on long walks. Steve Jobs used to go on long walks with his 
friend, Oracle founder Larry Ellison. All US Presidents needed R&R at Camp David to go on long walks to 
come up with impactful decisions. 
Go on at least one long walk per week in order to clear your thoughts and assess where you are in life. 
When you have a critical decision that needs to be made in life, take a long walk and decide what to do, 
especially when it comes to your career. 
When I worked in the consulting industry, I wasn’t passionate about what I was doing and I thought maybe 
an MBA might help? I played a round of golf alone and in between holes, I wrote down the pros and cons 
on going to business school on two separate pieces of paper. I then put a score out of ten next to each 
criteria; 10 was the highest score and 1 was the lowest score. I then added up the scores. The total score 
on the pros card outweighed the total score on the cons page. 
That long walk on the golf course that day in 1997 changed my life. 
Should I Go Back to School? 
Should you bother getting a graduate business or law or engineering or other degrees? Only if you need 
another degree in order to change careers. Only if getting a graduate degree will likely get you closer to 
your goals. If you want to go to business / MBA school and want help on how to get into a top school, 
please see this course: http://tiny.cc/chris116  
When Changing Careers Remember that ‘Nobody is Smarter than You!” 
Please accept that fact that everything around you in business was created by people that are no smarter 
than you. I am not asking you to be arrogant. Rather, I am asking you to materially increase your confidence 
by accepting the fact that you are the smartest person in the world. 
Why am I making such an outrageous request? Because if you believe it then you can accomplish any goal 
that you create in life regardless of how unrealistic others think it is. Actually, who cares what others think 
anyway! 
Quite often the reason people are not successful in business or don’t change careers is because they are 
not confident enough to accomplish their goals.

Can I do it? People Say I Can’t. Avoid ‘those” People 
Don’t let them get you down. That’s right. If you can, going forward disassociate yourself with negative 
people. Friends with negative attitudes are often not worth having. Surround yourself with positive people 
that believe there are no limits to what they and you can achieve. Surround yourself with people that are 
incredibly successful as their success, confidence and positive outlook on business and life will rub off on 
you and vice versa. 
Surround yourself with positive people and the chances of you being extraordinarily successful in changing 
careers rises 1,000,000%. I have never met a successful entrepreneur, investor or CEO that doesn’t have a 
positive attitude. Richard Branson is the quintessential example of a positive role model. I believe that his 
cheerful and positive outlook in life and business is the primary reason for his incredible success.  His 
positive attitude is the cornerstone of the happy and positive corporate culture at all of his Virgin 
companies. Try flying Virgin America or Virgin Atlantic or one day Virgin Galactic and observe how amazing 
the attitude is of all of his employees. A company with an incredibly positive corporate culture will no 
doubt be much more successful than a company filled with negative people. A negative person would 
never consider launching a galactic service or taking on the airline industry. Richard Branson clearly avoids 
hiring “those” people. 
I am a firm believer in letting our children do and be anything they want to be in life. Gone are the days of 
telling children to be doctors or lawyers. It’s their lives so they should just do what they are most 
passionate about. Steve Jobs was passionate about calligraphy and my kids enjoy legos and Minecraft. 
They can be anything they want to be. My goal is to make sure they do what they are most passionate 
about in life. 
 
Why are Technology Employees More Passionate than Other Sectors When it Comes to their Careers? 

An Entire MBA in 1 Book 
Page 381 of 384 
It certainly is fascinating how much innovation has come out of the technology sector versus other sectors. 
Why is this the case? It is partially due to passionate software engineers that never saw the profession as 
a job. Lawyers see their daily activities as jobs and the same can be said for most people in other 
professions, which is why most non-tech industries pale in innovation advancement, by comparison. 
In technology it is astonishing how a great engineer can be 10 times as productive as an average engineer. 
Why is this the case? Because the best engineers love what they do! This is more apparent in the 
technology industry than any other industry, which is why there are so many passionate CEOs like Marc 
Benioff in the sector. I bet that none of the parents of technology innovators urged them to be a 
programmer when they were younger! 
Can Someone be too Old to Change Careers? 
No darn way! When I was a kid I remember seeing commercials in Canada on TV for 'Freedom 55', which 
was a retirement savings company. Then as I got older, this age became 65 for those eligible to receive 
social security benefits. This age is slowly increasing. It’s ludicrous that people retire in their 60s or 70s. 
Heck, I know of many people in their 80s that are much sharper than I am. 
We are on the cusp of a biotech and healthcare renaissance were we will see the eradication of many 
diseases in the next few decades. I think most people alive today will live to be more than 100 if they take 
care of themselves. I know in my heart that at some point in my life people will live to 150+ years old. 
With this in mind, why would you want to retire in your 60s when you have another 100 potential years? 
You are never too old to start a new career or start a new company. Anybody that thinks otherwise is guilty 
in my humble opinion of age discrimination. It doesn’t matter how old or young you are, leverage your 
network and reinvent yourself over and over again until you find your passion!  
Ok are You Ready to Do this? 
Condition yourself to embrace change and enjoy the process. This will help you deal with the perceived 
stress and profit from adversity while you change careers. If you feel stressed when you start embarking 
upon the next [augmented] chapter of your life, ask yourself in business “what is positive about this event 
and how can I enjoy and benefit from it?” 
The belief that anything is possible leads to amazing accomplishments. 
The glass is not empty. 
The glass is not half empty. 
The glass is not half full. 
The glass is ALWAYS full!
