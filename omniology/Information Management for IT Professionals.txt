PREFACE
Considering the absolute key role that information plays in life in general and in 
business specifically, there is clearly a need to take control of the management 
of information in a business to ensure the ultimate success of that business. This 
book will be useful to students and managers who are currently involved in or 
learning about handling information in an office or business environment. 
The aim of the book is to provide a context in the minds of readers as to where 
information fits in a business and what the key considerations are when it comes 
to information. In the course of six chapters this book sets out how information 
and communication technologies can support information, how information can 
be linked together through information systems, how the Internet and the Web 
support the dissemination of information, and how to best manage information 
and information systems.
This book should equip you to better understand the flow, role and importance 
of information in your current or future business or what you can do to improve 
information management in a business. The book is easy to read and concise 
enough to bring together all the key considerations relating to information, 
management and business. I hope you enjoy it and learn from it. The world 
of information is an exciting one, and one that will open up many new career 
opportunities for you.

1.1 Introduction
Th is book is about information in business and how to manage that information. 
Th ere is a saying that information makes the world go round, which is certainly 
true. In the twenty-fi rst century, with hundreds of TV channels, the Web, 
Xboxes, email, smartphones and computer chips built into everything from cars 
to our pets’ bodies so they can’t get lost, we can certainly say the information age 
is upon us. 
Th is chapter introduces the context of business and business management. It 
identifi es various activities typically found in business, and outlines the various 
environments in which businesses operate. Within these contexts, we briefl y 
identify the role that information can play in business. Th is chapter sets the scene 
for the rest of the book.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
1.2 The context of business 
Centuries ago, our forefathers hunted and gathered foods in a nomadic fashion 
in order to survive. Slowly, they evolved a more organised and settled lifestyle, 
growing crops and keeping animals in groups. They made basic clothes, tools and 
homewares. They often exchanged or bartered their goods for goods that they did 
not have; for example, ten eggs for a piece of woven material. 
Today, modern societies consisting of entire cities and countries work together 
in an organised fashion to produce and exchange goods (products) and services. 
Modern society is built on the concept of exchange. As individuals, we are not 
able to produce everything that we need to survive and enjoy life. The only way we 
can do this is by working together, exchanging our physical strength, our time, our 
ideas, and our resources in order to create the goods and services that we need. By 
working together, we are able to create goods and services much more efficiently 
than we could on our own. However, there needs to be a way of determining how 
much we will each receive for the contribution we make to produce these goods and 
services. The work that people do is seldom involved in producing the goods and 
services they want or need, for example someone working in a car-manufacturing 
factory needs food, housing, medicine and clothing, not a small part of a car. It is 
therefore necessary to reward individuals for their effort or work and enable them 
to use these ‘rewards’ to acquire the goods and services they need. 
This is where money is useful. Each country has its own currency – such as the 
dollar, the pound, the yen, or the rand – which serves as a measure of the value 
of the effort we put into our work, and the value that we attach to the goods and 
services we need or wish to acquire. This makes it possible to receive money for 
our work effort and to exchange this money for the goods and services we need 
(food, clothing, transportation, etc). Money is our medium of exchange. The 
value attached to an item includes the cost of producing that particular good or 
service; it also includes an extra reward for having taken the initiative and effort to 
create the item – this reward component is usually referred to as a profit, margin 
or profit margin. The value of a particular good or service is reflected in its price (a 
monetary value which we define below). The price should be sufficient to cover all 
costs and to allow for a profit.
Another important concept is that of a market. A market is a physical place (often 
referred to as a marketplace) where we go to exchange money for goods or services 
(in the modern world marketplaces can also be a virtual place in cyberspace 
which is referred to as the market space). Put another way, a market is a place 
of exchange. In the marketplace, there are at least two parties to every exchange 

3
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
that takes place. The first is the seller who wishes to sell a good or service (the 
service could be labour, for example, where workers are willing to exchange their 
physical efforts for money). The second is the buyer who wishes to buy a particular 
good or service. These two parties come together in the marketplace and the buyer 
exchanges money at an agreed price for the good or service provided by the seller. 
The price is normally set by the seller. If the buyer does not agree to the price, no 
exchange is likely to take place; the seller will either have to lower the price or find 
a different buyer. Whether the seller is willing to drop the price depends on who is 
more desperate for the exchange to take place. If there are many other buyers or if 
the product is very scarce, then the seller is likely to keep their price; this is called a 
seller’s market. If there are many other or similar products for the buyer to choose 
from, or if there are many sellers, then the buyer will expect to pay a lower price; 
this is called a buyer’s market. 
The final and most important concept is that of a business. A business is an entity 
created by one or more individuals in order to use various resources (for example, 
money, equipment, labour and ideas) in order to create goods or services that 
are then sold in the marketplace in exchange for money. The word ‘business’ can 
also be part of a verb (‘do business’) that describes the act or process of bringing 
together various resources in order to create goods and services. Thus, a business 
(the entity) does business (the process). Businesses can also be referred to as firms, 
companies or organisations; all these terms are used in this book.
There are many reasons or purposes for creating a business entity. In relatively 
free-market societies such as South Africa, the United States, Australia and Japan, 
the main purpose is to make a profit. A profit can be defined as the additional 
monetary reward (or margin) that is added to the actual cost of producing a good 
or delivering a service to the consumer. In other, more socialist or controlled 
societies such as Cuba and China, the purpose behind creating a business is 
for the social good of the community. Businesses can be started by individuals, 
other businesses, governments, and even by groups of people or communities. 
Businesses either have a profit (reward) motive, or a non-profit (social) motive. In 
modern societies, businesses have legal status and are seen as legal entities in their 
own right just like individuals; this means that businesses can be sued by or can 
sue other businesses or individuals.
At the heart of all successful businesses is information. Businesses need to have 
information in order to make decisions. A business needs to make countless 
decisions in order to be successful and make a profit. A few examples are: what 
type of business to start, where to locate the business, which consumers to focus 

 
4
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
on, the selling prices for goods and services, how to attract customers, etc. All 
these decisions are made based on information; this book provides insight into 
the nature of this information and how to manage it.
In the next section, the focus moves to the context of business management.
1.3 The context of business management
The previous section referred to the many decisions that are taken when running 
a business, and the importance of information when making decisions. After 
considering many options, different facts and possible results, the person makes 
the decision that is likely to produce the greatest profit for the least risk. These 
decisions may either be longer-term, future decisions or shorter-term, right-now 
decisions. Longer-term decisions are usually more risky and require much more 
consideration and factual information in order to get them right; these are referred 
to as strategic decisions. Shorter-term decisions can be either tactical  (medium-
term) or operational decisions (to do with the day-to-day running of the business). 
The important point to remember is that, although we often speak of decisions or 
actions taken by company X or Y, in reality those decisions were taken by people. 
The decisions may be taken alone, as a group or in committees, but at the base of 
all business decisions is a person. Even in the case where automated decisions 
are taken (for example when machines are programmed to automatically decide 
to reject a product because it does not meet certain set standards), a person 
programmed the machine. 
Finally, it is also important to point out that there is a management task associated 
with doing business. All the activities and decisions associated with doing business 
need to be managed somehow. The management task involves certain individuals 
(managers) first setting business objectives and then deciding what activities are 
necessary to meet these objectives. The management task also involves ensuring 
that the business activities are carried out on time, effectively and efficiently to 
minimise costs and maximise profits for the business. The management task 
generally involves instructing and controlling other people for example labourers, 
designers, researchers, engineers, technicians, cleaners, accountants, and so on. 
The management and workers in a firm make up its staff.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
1.4 The role of the firm in business
In this section, we revisit the concept of the business (the entity).
1.4.1 The firm
The firm can be described as an independent institution, established by an 
entrepreneur to make a profit by producing goods or providing services that 
satisfy the needs of consumers. The entrepreneur identifies a consumer need 
and establishes a firm (also referred to as a company, enterprise, or organisation) 
to produce goods or provide services to satisfy that need. The entrepreneur’s 
motivation is to make a profit. Both the entrepreneur and the consumer benefit 
from the establishment of the enterprise; consumers are able to satisfy their needs 
and the entrepreneur makes a profit.
1.4.2 Typical tasks, activities and functions in a firm
Figure 1.1 illustrates the relationship between the business activities of an 
entrepreneur, Thumi Lekoto, and the physical business itself. Thumi manufactures 
shoes and will combine various factors of production in his business, including 
raw materials (for example leather, glue, electricity), capital (for example money, 
machines and the factory building), labour (ie the staff), and entrepreneurship 
(his own willingness to take creative risks with his money in order to make a profit).

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Put another way, Thumi will employ people to work for him (labour). He will 
also use his capital to buy the raw materials (natural resources) that he needs to 
manufacture the shoes. In the factory, the production activities will take place 
involving machines and tools (capital goods) combined with labour (staff). The 
factory can therefore be described as the place or location where inputs like raw 
materials and other components are processed to produce a product. Thumi will 
now use marketing techniques to sell these shoes to customers to generate income 
for his business. He will also use various external promotional activities to improve 
the image of his firm. Co-ordinating all these activities is a management task. There 
are also various administrative and office activities that are needed to perform the 
tasks and functions outlined above. 
There is a relationship between the firm and its physical location because that is 
usually where all the business activities take place. In larger firms or enterprises, 
however, there may be many factories involved and the firm may have one or 
more separate buildings where the management and other specialist tasks (such 
as research and development) are undertaken. The main location where the 
management tasks are undertaken is usually referred to as the firm’s head office 
or headquarters. For example, SABMiller, previously an entirely South African 
company with its head office in Johannesburg and factories around South Africa, 
is now a global enterprise headquartered in London in the United Kingdom. They 
are one of the largest beer producers in the world and have many factories located 
across the globe (including in South Africa). 
Figure 1.2 below depicts the various departments commonly found in business 
entities. The typical functions undertaken by most manufacturing firms include 
those listed below. 


General management – this management function cannot be placed in a 
‘department of its own’. It concerns all the broad activities necessary to ensure 
the smooth operation of the firm as a whole, such as setting the overall business 
strategy of the firm. 


Office management – like general management, office management also does 
not exist in a ‘department on its own’. The office function is concerned with the 
tasks of obtaining information, recording and analysing it, and communicating 
the results to management. Management uses this information to promote 
and improve the firm’s activities and achieve the objectives of the business.


Financial department – manages the business’s financial activities, including 
obtaining capital and the efficient use of capital. The financial manager is 
responsible for controlling all the financial activities in the business.

7
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT


Purchasing department – obtains all the resources that a business needs to 
achieve its objectives. This includes, among other things, determining what 
needs to be purchased, establishing alternative suppliers, and negotiating 
agreements with the suppliers to the long-term advantage of the firm.


Production (operations) department – operations management refers to the 
processes used to manufacture or supply the product, or deliver the service, 
that the business supplies to the consumer. 


Marketing department – marketing is the process of promoting, pricing and 
transferring goods and services to customers. Marketing entails more than just 
advertising; it includes a variety of activities across all functions of the business.


Human resources department – includes all the activities concerned with 
personnel, for example recruitment, training and development, employee 
rights and payment.


Public relations department – creates positive publicity for the firm. It often 
forms part of the marketing department. Public relations management 
evaluates public attitudes and takes action to earn the public’s acceptance 
and understanding of the business’s policies and procedures. 


Accounting department – this department may sometimes fall within the 
finance department. It is responsible for keeping the accounts for the firm. 
These accounts may include recording all transactions with the debtors and 
creditors of the firm, as well as creating the annual accounts required for tax 
purposes.


Other departments – will depend on the nature of the business. For example, 
some firms have additional departments such as research and development, 
design (especially in creative firms), customer support, call centres and 
servicing departments to repair and maintain the products they sell.

1.5 The business environment of the firm
Firms do not operate as isolated, empty entities. Instead, they employ people 
(staff), they buy products and services from other firms (their suppliers) and they 
sell their products or services to other companies or individuals (their customers). 
Firms also make use of service providers (such as banks, transport companies and 
advertising agencies) to help them do their work. 
All the activities that occur around and within a firm are referred to as an 
environment. The environment in which a business functions may be defined 
as all the factors which influence the business either positively or negatively 
Firms generally have to deal with two broad environments, namely their internal 
environment and their external environment. The external environment may be 
further divided into sub-environments, which we will discuss in more detail later 
in this chapter. 
These environments influence how firms operate. They may represent opportunities 
(for example a competitor goes out of business) or constraints (for example staff 
who are not very well trained, or an increase in the tax). Firms need to know how 
to react to the changes in the various environments. The firm’s success depends 
on how well they react to these opportunities and challenges; for this reason, we 
examine the business environment in more detail in the following section.
EXAMPLE 1.1 Reacting to the business environment3
A countrywide drought is an example of a change in the external environment that will have 
a significant influence on farmers, while it has no effect on the manufacturers of sporting 
equipment. However, if consumers’ recreation needs change, there will be implications for the 
manufacturers of sports equipment, while farmers will be unaffected. The effect of environmental 
variables on a business is therefore determined by the place and role of the business in the total 
national economy of a country.
1.5.1 Characteristics of the business environment
The business environment has several unique characteristics. Some of these are 
outlined below.


The business environment changes constantly – Factors which influence the 
business today will not necessarily have the same influence tomorrow. In 
1985, disinvestment in South Africa had a tremendous impact on the economy. 
However, as a result of political change in the country, disinvestment no longer 
plays a role in the economy and the products of various overseas countries are 
now freely available in South Africa.

9
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT


The business must be in step with the changing environment – During the 
past few years, emphasis has been placed on the protection of the natural 
environment and this has resulted in businesses having to adapt their 
products accordingly. Today environmentally friendly or ‘green’ products are 
available on all shop shelves.


There are both opportunities and threats in the business environment – 
Opportunities and threats arise as a result of certain events in the environment 
and they influence the functioning of the business. An opportunity is a 
favourable situation for the business, while a threat may bankrupt it. For 
example, a new restaurant opening nearby might be an advantage for a guest 
house, but a threat to other restaurants in the area. Businesses must decide 
how to react to opportunities and threats. 


The establishment, growth and continued existence of the business are directly 
influenced by the business environment – If a business does not take account of 
the variables in the business environment, it may no longer be able to compete 
in the marketplace. This could result in a drastic reduction in the business’s 
sales and could lead to its eventual closure.


The business environment influences the future of the business – The continued 
existence of the business is directly related to its future potential. The 
management of the business should consider how conditions may change in 
the future, and make adjustments accordingly.
1.5.2 The internal and external environments
Firms need to make decisions in the context of two core environments within 
which they operate. 


Internal environment – this is the business itself and is also described as the 
micro-business environment.


External environment – everything outside the business that affects the 
growth and existence of the business. The external environment can be divided 
into the market environment and the macro-environment.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
The micro-environment
The micro-environment consists of all the internal factors and variables in 
the business; it is influenced directly or indirectly by the decisions of the firm’s 
management. These factors and variables are vitally important to the establishment, 
growth and continued existence of the business. The factors include:


Mission statement and objectives of the business – This is what the business 
hopes to achieve and the way in which it can be achieved. The mission 
statement and objectives of the business must correspond with the demands 
of the external environment.


The functions within the firm – These include general management, production 
management, purchasing management, marketing management, financial 
management, administrative management, personnel management and 
public relations.


The factors of production of the business – This refers to the resources available to 
a business. The production factors or resources include labour, raw materials, 
capital and entrepreneurship. Using these resources, the business must utilise 
opportunities or respond to threats in the external environment. For example, 
if a business has sufficient capital available, new markets and new products 
can be explored. On the other hand, a lack of capital may be a threat to the 
business because, unlike its competitors, the business is placed in a weaker 
position in the market.
The influence of management on the micro-environment
The management of a business exerts a direct influence on the mission 
statement and objectives of the business. Management decides where the 
business is going and what it will do to get there. Management produces 
guidelines according to which the business’s functions will be handled. In 
other words, management decides how personnel functions will be done, and 
how the business will execute its administrative function. Management can 
also decide how the available production factors should be combined. For 
example, is the business capital-intensive, as in the construction industry, or 
is it labour-intensive as in the case of nurseries and vegetable farms?
The micro-environment is the heart of a business. It also indicates to what 
extent a business is able to utilise opportunities or oppose threats in the 
external environment. Although the business can influence the internal 
environment by means of decision making, it does not possess all the internal 
resources needed to handle opportunities and threats from the external 
environment. In other words, a business cannot function, grow or survive in a 
vacuum or in isolation.

11
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
The market environment 
A market can be seen as the link between the business and the business 
environment in which it functions. It surrounds the micro-environment. The 
market consists of all the factors and variables which exist externally and which can 
positively or negatively influences the growth and existence of the business. The 
market environment is surrounded by the macro-environment (see Figure 1.3). 
The business’s management has limited influence on the market environment. It 
is possible for the business to influence the market on occasion, for example if 
it markets a successful product which is popular everywhere. The business can 
also create a need in the market which did not exist before, for example when 
cordless telephones were introduced for the first time, a need was created in the 
marketplace. The market environment therefore does not exist in isolation, but 
is influenced by both the micro- and macro-environments. We can explain this 
interaction by means of the following examples.
EXAMPLE 1.2 How the micro-environment influences the market environment4
lf one business introduces a new product to the market, for example a new shampoo, this 
influences consumers. In many cases, the new product is preferred to existing products on the 
market (in other words, it is preferred to the products of competitors).
A business credit and collection policy can influence the consumer in the market environment. For 
example, consumers may prefer to buy from a business which sells on credit, even if they know 
that the prices of the products are inflated to provide for credit risks (the possibility of bad debts). 
A consumer may therefore prefer to buy clothes from a chain store rather than from a boutique 
because the chain store offers credit facilities, while the boutique only sells goods on a cash basis. 
The market environment is also influenced by the macro-environment. During 
a downward trend in the economy, for example, consumers have less money to 
spend on luxury items and this leads to a reduction in the sale of products such as 
expensive, imported dinner services, fancy clothing and luxury cars.
The lifting of the trade sanctions which were imposed on South Africa has made 
a greater variety of imported products available in the country. Imported ceramic 
ware from countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal is commonly available at chain 
stores, whereas a few years ago it was available only in exclusive shops.
The variables in the market environment, and the way they affect the firm at 
times, differ from business to business. However, certain sectors or branches are 
more affected by market variables; compare, for example, the shoe industry and 
the construction industry. There are three variables in the market environment, 
namely the market, the competition and the suppliers of resources and services.

 
12
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
The market 
In this sense, ‘market’ refers to consumers and their needs rather than the actual 
marketplace. Business manufacturers buy products and/or provide services 
with the idea of selling these to consumers. However, before consumers can 
become active in the market, they must have the financial means (money) 
to acquire the available goods or services in the market. Consumers have 
to choose between different goods and services because they have limited 
financial means. Even if consumers have the necessary financial means, they 
might not be prepared to spend them on the available goods and services in 
the market.
From the point of view of the business, the market is therefore all individuals, 
groups or institutions who have specific needs for goods and who are prepared 
to use the available financial means to acquire them.
EXAMPLE 1.3 The markets of different businesses


The market of a clothing shop like Edgars includes all people with a need for clothing. These 
people are prepared to spend the money they have available on these articles. Their activities 
are therefore directed at satisfying their needs.


The market of South African Airways includes all people with a need to travel domestically or 
internationally, and who have the financial means to pay for the air ticket. These people must 
therefore be prepared to spend money on an air ticket in order to satisfy a need to travel.


Some manufacturing businesses do not trade directly with the general public. Their market 
may include wholesalers and retailers. In these cases, the market does not consist of 
individuals but rather of other businesses. For example, you cannot buy a bottle of apple juice 
directly from a fruit farmer; you would buy it from a retailer like Pick n Pay. The retailer, in 
turn, buys it from its manufacturers, for example Liqui-Fruit. 
From the above examples it is clear that we can identify more than one type of 
market. These include:


the consumer market comprising consumers who buy goods for their own 
or home consumption


industrial markets where raw materials, components and consumables are 
purchased by businesses as part of their production processes to create 
products for sale to consumers or other businesses


the resale market where manufactured goods are purchased by businesses 
in order to resell them at a profit (Pick n Pay, for example, buys canned 
vegetables such as KOO and All Gold to sell at a profit to their customers)


the international market where goods are sold and exported outside of the 
borders of South Africa

13
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT


the government market, where goods and services are purchased 
by the various government authorities such as central government, 
municipalities, regional agencies, and provincial government, in order to 
provide certain services and carry out certain activities (for example the 
purchase of furniture and equipment for use in government schools).
Consumers
The business must be geared towards satisfying the consumer’s needs while 
at the same time trying to achieve the objective of profitability. A fine balance 
between these two objectives is essential, especially in the light of the current 
emphasis on marketing-oriented business management. It is important for the 
business to handle its market, which is actually the consumer, in the right way. 
Consumers have certain rights in the interaction between themselves and 
the business. The business must be aware of information from the external 
environment to keep abreast of the rights of consumers. Institutions like 
the Consumer Goods Council of South Africa (CGCSA) focus on informing 
consumers of their rights and therefore prepare them to approach the 
marketplace as informed people. The consumer’s rights are summarised below.
The consumer has the right to:


Be informed – The consumer must be informed in an objective way about 
the products and services which are available. The business must not 
mislead or harm the consumer by withholding information about a specific 
product. For example, the consumer has a right to know the ingredients in 
a tin of food.


Exercise personal choice – A variety of products and services is available 
on the market and consumers have the right to decide which product or 
service they are going to buy. For example, they have the right to choose 
between All Gold and KOO products.


Be heard – The business must be geared towards listening to and 
responding to their customers’ complaints and requests. For example, if 
consumers complain about the service which they receive from a business, 
the manager should respond. 


Protection – The safety of consumers is important and they should be 
protected against unsafe products, for example the warning on cigarette 
boxes that smoking is a health risk.

 
14
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Competitors
The fact that the business does not function in a vacuum has already been 
emphasised. Competition is an important variable in this regard. A certain 
business, for example, is probably not the only business offering a specific 
product or service to the customer. There are various businesses which compete 
with one another to sell the same product or service to the same consumers.
The essence of competition is the fact that each business tries to convince 
the same consumers that its products and services are the best, and that the 
consumer should support that business rather than the competitors. One need 
only consider the large number of businesses that manufacture and sell cars. 
The consumer may choose which product to buy and from whom to buy it. The 
choice between different products indicates competition in the market.
The business must be fully aware of influence and strength of their competition, 
because the actions of competitors may create threats to the business. For 
example, a business may fold if the demand for a product drops (for example 
Blu-ray is beginning to take over from DVDs, which took over from CDs, which 
took over from long-playing records). Businesses are continually forced to 
make adjustments to counteract the threats of competitors. It is therefore 
extremely important to be informed about competitors in the external business 
environment. Each business must know who its competitors are, where they are 
situated (the geographic distribution), the products they offer the market, the 
quality of the products, the specific markets they serve, what their share of the 
market is, their financial resources, and their general image in the marketplace.
Businesses try to influence consumers to choose their products or services 
instead of their competitors’ products or services; this is one of the reasons 
why businesses advertise their products and services. Over and above the fact 
that businesses compete with one another’s products and services, we can also 
distinguish between the following types of competition.


Competition between the needs of consumers – A person may go to a new 
shopping complex and be prepared to spend a certain amount of money 
there, which may entail either buying new clothes or having something 
to eat. This is called competition for the limited disposable income of the 
consumer.


Competition between the ways that a need can be satisfied – Let us suppose 
that the person decides to buy new clothes. Depending on the person’s 
needs, this could be formal wear (a suit), casual wear (jeans, a jersey or 
leather jacket) or sportswear (a tracksuit).

15
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT


Competition between product types – Suppose the person wants to buy a 
new suit. He or she must now choose between wool, cotton and linen.


Competition between different trademarks – If the person decides to buy a 
woollen suit, there is a choice between the various brands or trademarks.
Suppliers 
A business decides for itself which products it is going to manufacture and 
market, in what quantities, and how much capital will be invested in the 
specific projects. However, the business depends on certain institutions in the 
external environment in order to start and carry out its activities. The business 
does not necessarily have the raw materials to manufacture its products and 
therefore uses the products or services of other businesses. For example:


A manufacturing business buys land and resources from another business 
in the interests of further development. Some commercial businesses will 
purchase products (such as toiletries, groceries or hardware products) 
from the manufacturers in order to resell them to various chain stores.


Businesses need resources like electricity, water and communications 
services. These are purchased from suppliers in the external business 
environment. Electricity, for example, is obtained from Eskom and 
communications services from Telkom.


It is almost impossible to run a business without the help of financial 
institutions. In the money and capital markets, these include commercial 
banks and the stock exchange. It is important for the business to raise 
long- and short-term capital. Commercial banks make loans available over 
different periods. A public company can sell shares on the Johannesburg 
Stock Exchange (JSE) in order to raise external source of capital.


The business needs labour in order to be able to function properly, which is 
obtained from the external business environment. Pick n Pay, for example, 
employs people in a wide variety of posts, including store managers, sales 
staff and till operators. When there are vacancies, the posts are advertised 
in the open labour market, which is part of the external environment.


The business uses various intermediaries to make products available 
to the target market. For example, a manufacturing business may sell its 
products to a wholesaler (an intermediary), who in turn sells them to a 
retailer. In the same way, the business makes use of an advertising agency 
(an intermediary) to advertise its products. An intermediary is also called 
a middleman.

 
16
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
The macro-environment
The macro-environment surrounds the business and its marketing environment. 
It is made up of a wide variety of variables which can affect the business either 
positively or negatively. The macro-environment can be defined as consisting of 
all the variables and factors outside the business which influence the business and 
affect the achievement of objectives. The individual business has no control over 
this environment or the variables which operate within it. For example, a business 
has no control over a rise in interest rates or a change in the exchange rate. The 
macro-environment influences all businesses, even their competitors. 
The macro-environment consists of a number of sub-environments which cannot 
be controlled by the business, but which can exert a significant influence over 
it. These sub-environments may also be described as variables or forces in the 
macro-environment. These sub-environments are the economic, socio-cultural, 
political, technological, legal, statutory, physical and international influences and 
forces that form part of the macro-environment.
These sub-environments influence one another to the extent that they cannot be 
regarded as being distinct from one another. The effect that these sub-environments 
have on a business differs from business to business and from time to time. At a 
specific time, for example, an economic environment where interest rates are very 
high (which influences the availability of external capital) may constitute a much 
greater threat of influence than variables operating in the technological area. Each 
sub-environment is characterised by various factors peculiar to that environment. 
This is a topic that is beyond this book, but it is a topic that you should read up on 
more, by searching for ‘macro environment’ on the Internet.
1.6 It’s about people
This point was made earlier, but is worth repeating. It is not the legal or physical 
firm that reacts to environments; it’s the people – the individuals – within the 
firm that react to the environments, and that make decisions. Often, however, 
researchers, academics, journalists and the public in general, refer to firms 
and businesses as though they have a ‘human’ character and that the ‘firm’ is 
responsible for its actions. From a legal perspective this may well be true – all 
legally constituted firms have a legal standing and can be sued or can, in turn, 
sue others. However, it is important to remember that it is the individual within 
the firm that is actually making a decision or doing something, even if machines 
ultimately execute their decisions or undertake many of the mundane tasks 
within a firm. It’s about people.

17
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
1.7 Input–Transform–Output
Most manufacturing firms take part in three main activities in order to make money. 
1. 	 The firm buys inputs from other firms (their suppliers). These inputs could 
be raw materials, parts that need to be assembled, electricity, etc. 
2. 	 The business then transforms or changes these inputs into something else – a 
product. This is referred to as a transformation or conversion process and the 
product is the output of the firm. 
3. 	 The firm sells these outputs to their customers (other firms or consumers).
This input–transform–output process is also referred to as the manufacturing 
process. Various other terms or phrases are also used to describe this manufacturing 
process. Figure 1.4 summarises this process.

1.8 Management
We have briefly introduced the concept of management earlier in this chapter and 
we return to it in chapter 6. Management is crucial for the successful operation of 
any business. Without an overarching ‘guiding hand’ (the manager), the activities 
within the business will be directionless.
The key tasks underpinning management are planning, implementing the 
plan, and controlling or ensuring that what is being done achieves the original 
purpose behind the action or activity. However, in order to plan, implement and 
control effectively, one key ingredient is required, namely information. Without 
information, there can be no managing, no managers and no management. This 
leads us to our last point for this chapter, namely the role of information in business.

 
18
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
1.9 The role of information in business
This book is about information, information principles and information management. 
Everything we have discussed above has an information component to it. 


There can be no management without information to guide their decisions.


The environments are built on and around information.


Firms need to inform customers. 


Customers need information to make choices between products that they are 
considering buying.
Businesses thrive on information; humans couldn’t exist with information. In fact, 
information is the ‘oil’ that enables our entire human world to function as it does. 
Take information out of the loop and society would almost certainly collapse. 
Good information translates into success, while bad information is likely to lead to 
failure. In the next chapter we discuss this topic in greater detail. 
1.10 Summary
This chapter introduced the concept of the firm and business (both the entity 
and the process). We discussed the business environment, the importance of the 
human element, the need for management and the role of information in ‘oiling’ 
all business activities in the firm. In the next chapter, we move on to discuss the 
role of information in business in more detail.

2.1 Introduction
Th e previous chapter introduced the concepts of business and business 
management and the context in which business is done. Th e chapter emphasised 
the role that information plays in ‘oiling’ the smooth running of businesses. 
Th is chapter builds on this by discussing the role of information in business. 
Th e nature of information is discussed, including the information requirements 
of fi rms, the characteristics of good information, and the relationship between 
information and the various functions in a fi rm. 

 
22
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
2.2 The nature of information
This section defines the term information and examines its links to data, knowledge 
and intelligence. 
2.2.1 Defining information, data and knowledge
There are many definitions for the term information. Information is meaningful 
collections of data.1 Drawing on the work of Zins, information can be further 
defined as data that has been processed, manipulated and organised in a way 
suitable for human interpretation, and that adds to the knowledge of the person 
receiving it.2 Information is usually compiled in response to a specific need and 
often with the purpose of revealing trends or patterns.
Information is a critical resource in business as it represents the key to decision 
making at all levels in the business.3, 4, 5 Without information, business owners and 
managers cannot make the critical decisions that they need to make every day. 
Typical decisions could be what staff to hire, what marketing strategy to follow, 
whether to expand the business, and whether to offer a discount to a particular 
customer. Each of these decisions must be made after studying information 
(which, in turn, is linked to data). Data and information are very closely linked. 
Data (the plural of datum) can be defined as ‘a collection of facts from which 
conclusions may be drawn’. 6 Put another way, data is factual information used as 
a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation. It is the raw material – the input – 
of information.7 Data can exist in many forms, for instance, as written numbers or 
text, as bits and bytes stored electronically, or as facts stored in a person’s mind.8 
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines knowledge as the fact or condition 
of knowing something with familiarity and is often gained through experience 
or association. Put another way, knowledge is what you already know. It can 
be categorised as either unstructured or structured, explicit or tacit. What one 
knows one knows is explicit knowledge. Knowledge that is unstructured and 
understood, but not clearly expressed is implicit knowledge. If the knowledge is 
organised and easy to share then it is called structured knowledge.9 To convert 
implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, it must be extracted and formatted. Be 
aware that tacit knowledge – the knowledge in our heads and that comes personal 
experiences and contexts – is not the same as implicent knowledge.
Beyond knowledge there is intelligence. Intelligence is defined as the ability to 
learn or understand or deal with new or trying situations. Oz expands this view by 
arguing that intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge, to think, 
and to reason.10 It takes both knowledge and intelligence to be successful – neither 
is sufficient on its own.11 Figure 2.1 below links intelligence to knowledge.

2.2.2 The information revolution
More than thirty years ago, Bell foretold the coming of what he called ‘post-
industrial society’ – an information society.12 He envisaged businesses moving 
away from mainly manufacturing industries, towards processing, recycling, and 
services. Bell suggested that this new information society would have three main 
features: 


It would involve the change from a commodity-producing society to a service 
society.


It would concentrate on the codification of theoretical knowledge for 
innovation in technology.


It would create a new ‘intellectual technology,’ which would serve as a key 
component of systems analysis and decision theory.
Indeed, Bell wrote, ‘when knowledge becomes involved in some systemic form in 
the applied transformation of resources (through invention or social design), then 
one can say that knowledge, not labor, is the source of value’. 13
In this new society, knowledge (including information) is the main commodity 
exchanged in the marketplace. In an industrial society, the main factors of production 
are capital and labour; in today’s information society, information and knowledge 
are the main factors of production. Martin suggests that ‘Without an uninterrupted 
flow for this vital resource, society as we know it would quickly run into difficulties, 
with business and industry, education, leisure, travel and communications, national 
and international affairs vulnerable to disruption. In more advanced societies, this 
vulnerability is heightened by an increased dependence on the enabling powers of 
information and communications technologies’. 14

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
2.3 The role of the information function in a firm
The information function is one of the basic functions that usually exists in all 
firms. In many medium to larger firms, the function is a formal function, perhaps 
even a department on its own. In small firms, the information function may be part 
of the firm’s other functions. 
Generally, information management does not comprise one position, one office 
or one department, but instead the entire management component works in an 
information capacity. In other words, all the firm’s departments also perform 
certain information-related tasks and activities; they are not performed by a single 
information department. For example, all departments make use of telephone 
calls, reprography (photocopying) and handle mail on a daily basis.
The information function relates to reporting in the widest sense of the word. 
Although the focus is on the management information system and its components, 
it covers the whole network of records of the firm, providing information for 
management purposes.
The information function does not earn income for the firm. It is a function that 
provides a service to other individuals and departments in the firm, enabling the 
latter to be more cost-effective. The information function frees individuals from 
many of their information responsibilities, enabling them to give attention to other 
matters. In management, a manager may appoint an office professional to take 
care of office tasks such as filing and correspondence, allowing the manager to 
focus on managing the firm.
In addition to the individual manager’s field of specialisation, information is 
regarded as the most important management tool. Managers have never before 
had so much information at their disposal to support their work and decision-
making activities. Most managers will also agree that the effectiveness with 
which the information is managed will determine its usefulness. The information 
function is able to make a significant contribution to the success of the firm through 
specialised support in the management of information.
It is crucial for the information manager to keep up with technological 
developments in this field. Technological development is the largest factor 
responsible for the considerable increase in the amount of information available 
to managers. It not only creates large amounts of new information, but it also 

25
CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN BUSINESS
makes existing information more readily available, accessible and convenient to 
use. Think of the development of computer software packages that are improved 
daily to make provision for faster and better processing of information.
2.3.1 Information activities
The information function covers a wide spectrum of information activities. The 
needs of different departments and the amount of information needed in the 
firm will determine which of these activities will be found in the firm. Information 
activities are quite diverse and could include the handling of information in all 
its forms; for example handling mail, filing, indexing and copying documents. It 
could even include reception, word processing, correspondence, costing, credit 
control, bookkeeping and ordering. In small firms one often finds that many other 
activities are also classified as administration, such as the activities related to sales 
warehouse management and deliveries.
Information managers must possess a thorough understanding of various aspects 
of the firm. A solid background of all the other organisational functions is needed 
to do the work effectively and efficiently. According to Quible, a specialised 
knowledge of the following areas is important:15

FIGURE 2.2 The position of the information function in a firm16
The information manager is responsible for the general management of the 
information function. This person is also constantly in contact with all the other 
functional managers and users of information systems. These functional managers 
need to co-ordinate their needs, especially their information needs. This will 
ensure an efficient flow of information, enabling each function to plan realistically 
and reach their objectives in the most efficient manner.
There are many alternatives available for staffing the information function. The 
positions to manage and execute all the activities in this function will depend on 
many factors and is governed by:


The size of the firm – The larger the organisations the more specialised the 
positions in this function become. Smaller firms often combine many of these 
tasks (for example finance and administration) into one position.


The type of industry in which the firm is involved – It could be in the primary 
(exploitative 
organisations), 
secondary 
(transforming 
or 
processing 
organisations) or tertiary (provides final product or service) sectors. The needs 
in these sectors are different.


The policy and philosophy of top management – Do they accept the use of 
the systems approach and technology? The amount of money available for 
technology and the maintenance of the systems often govern these decisions.
In some firms, consultants are used to design, implement and maintain information 
systems. Part-time staff can also be used. These decisions depend on the needs of 
the specific firm. Consultants usually make recommendations but leave the final 
decision to the management of the firm. Consultants provide the expertise and, 
because they are outsiders, their recommendations are usually objective. Many are 
hired on a temporary or part-time basis to maintain the system. One disadvantage 
in this case is that they are not available all the time, especially when immediate 
assistance is needed.

27
CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN BUSINESS
2.4 Information and the roles and levels of management
Botha, Bothma and Geldenhuys point out that managers essentially play three 
roles in their organisations, namely the interpersonal, decision-making and 
information roles (see Figure 2.3).17 In the interpersonal role, the manager acts 
as a ﬁgurehead who attends meetings and staff functions and makes speeches 
at various events. In this role, the manager has to be well informed; for example, 
when speaking at a staff member’s funeral, the manager needs to know personal 
details about the deceased. 
In the decision-making role, the manager needs relevant and reliable facts and ﬁgures 
in order to take informed decisions. Uninformed decision making could lead to poor 
or incorrect decisions. Technology can assist in making the necessary information 
available to the manager. Uninformed decisions can have serious negative 
consequences for an organisation, hence the need for high-quality information.
In their information role, managers provide information to their subordinates. 
They also collect information from various sources and then share it with their 
superiors, peers and subordinates to ensure effective management of the business. 
FIGURE 2.3 The role of managers in an organisation18
It is evident that information is required by managers in order to perform the 
management function effectively and efﬁciently. Information also plays a major 
role in the success of a business in that it supports operations, decision making 
and business strategy; this is made possible through the use of technology (see 
Figures 2.4 and 2.5).

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
EXAMPLE 2.1 The role of information in a supermarket
In order to understand the role of information in organisations, a hypothetical situation in a 
technologically advanced supermarket will be used.19


Operational level – One of the basic operations of a supermarket is cashing up. When customers’ 
purchases are scanned, the data is stored on a database. Based on previous reports, it is possible 
to identify the peak shopping periods. The checkout manager can schedule when to open all tills, 
when to increase or decrease the number of casuals, and when to plan for overtime work. At an 
operational level, historical information is needed. 


Decision-making level – At this level, managers can access information from the database in the 
form of reports and graphs. They will be able to differentiate between products or services that sell 
fast and those that move more slowly. Based on this information, management can take decisions, 
such as how much space to allocate to certain lines, which items to order more or less of, or which 
items to promote or discontinue. Managers can also use external information, such as competitors’ 
advertisements to adjust pricing in order to increase sales. At this level, the manager relies on 
current information. 


Strategic level – At this level, management is not concerned with the number of bars of soap 
that pass through a till, or the number of days that an employee was absent. Senior management 
requires information that shows ‘the big picture’ of what is going on over a period of time, or at 
different branches. This information comes from cumulative figures, information regarding changes 
in the economy, and changes in competitor strategies. Examples of long-term decisions are 
selling off unproﬁtable stores, upsizing stores that have the potential to succeed, and opening or 
acquiring new stores. At a strategic level, most decisions regarding the future are predictions, and 
here information has to be historical, current and also consist of forecasts.
Based on Figure 2.4, it would seem that the least information is required by senior management 
at a strategic level. However, this is not the case, as Figure 2.5 shows. At an operational level, 
information is historical and sourced internally. At a decision-making level, information must be 
current and is mainly internal with some external inﬂuence. At a strategic level, large quantities of 
information of a predictive nature, sourced mainly from the outside, are required in order to take 
long-term decisions. Information sourced from the outside is not always relevant or reliable and, as 
such, organisations need to be very systematic in their search. The Internet is proving to be a major 
resource in acquiring and sharing information. Businesses are increasingly using the Internet to 
engage in competitive intelligence.

2.5 The information needs of the firm
Firms have different goals, products and managers and because of this they 
will have different information needs. The information needs at the different 
management levels within the firm are also different. Furthermore, there are 
external role-players who need information regarding certain aspects of the firm, 
and their needs also differ. 
2.5.1 Information needs of external role-players
Depending on the type of external organisation the firm is involved with, it needs 
a system to supply external role-players with specific information. They could be 
any of the following:


government departments requiring information on income, labour, health 
and safety, etc


governing bodies of certain industries that need statistics about their industry


suppliers who need to know about future order quantities


shareholders who would like to know how their firms are performing


banks that would like to know how their clients are doing


any other external person or entity that requires information.
The firm must determine this need and develop a system whereby the relevant 
information can be collected, processed and distributed wherever and whenever 
required. Information could be also supplied to the environment in the form of 
advertisements, and annual and financial reporting. Supplying the information to 
the external environment is usually the task of the marketing and external relations 
function manager.

 
30
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
2.5.2 Internal information needs of the firm
Secondly we have the need for information for internal use. This information 
can be gathered from the external environment, as well as from within the firm. 
To survive and compete in the global market, the firm surely needs information 
about the external environment. This information must be analysed and the 
relevant information should be incorporated in the decision-making process. The 
information needed at each management level will differ and is determined by the 
type of decisions and the speed at which they need to be taken.
Information needs of top management
Top management needs information from outside the firm about the following:


The general economic variables – especially if the business operates in the 
global market. The value of the rand against other currencies can make a 
huge difference if it drops while you are in the process of buying goods from 
overseas. Locally, the interest rates can change and certain materials might 
become scarce in the future.


Government legislation – Depending on the type of industry, changes in 
legislation can force the firm to make costly changes.


Technological changes and developments – The most recent models of 
computers are usually faster and can handle more information. This can give 
an organisation the competitive edge they need.


Competitors in the market – Management needs to know how strong the 
competition is, and what their competitors are doing regarding marketing and 
product strategies.
Top management relies on direct information for long-term planning and policy 
decisions. In order to make long-term decisions regarding the business itself, 
management considers information such as:


changing consumer patterns


the trends of income and expenditure in different product lines


the impact of new technology


population and other social trends. 
Computerised technology plays an important role in long-term planning. 
Computerised information processing, information retrieval and centralised 
computer facilities provide management with data and information. Top 
management can use sophisticated analysis, forecasting and simulation techniques 
as a basis for the long-term decisions.

31
CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN BUSINESS
All this information enables top management to make decisions and counteract 
any changes from competitors that could affect the firm negatively. With this 
external information available, management can then look internally and decide 
whether the firm is properly aligned to face the future.
Information needs of the functional (middle level) managers
Senior management takes strategic decisions about the business’s future. These 
decisions are then communicated to the functional managers. The functional 
managers, representing the middle management level, need information to manage 
their individual functions effectively. They also use information to enable them 
to assist senior management in the planning, development and implementation 
of policies. Table 2.1 summarises examples of external and internal information 
needed by functional managers.

Information needs of supervisors (lower level managers)
Supervisors need information to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities on 
a day-to-day basis. They need information to control daily operations. They can 
obtain this information from schedules, Gantt charts, budgets, and feedback from 
subordinates. This data or information is then processed to enable supervisors 
to make meaningful decisions about corrective action or changes if and when 
necessary. The relevant information is also given to middle management every 
week or month as feedback about operations, the work processes and productivity.
2.5.3 The flow of information in the firm
Managers and employees at all levels of the firm need information to make 
decisions and solve problems in their daily work. Information flows vertically 
and horizontally within the firm. As we have seen, higher level managers need 
information for strategic planning, while middle and lower level managers 
need information for the implementation of these plans and daily operations. 
Employees need information to accomplish their tasks. Figure 2.6 illustrates the 
flow of information and the information needs in a firm.

FIGURE 2.6 External and internal information needs of a firm23
Figure 2.6 shows the different management levels of the firm as a whole. The middle 
and lower levels consist of the different organisational functions such as marketing, 
operations, purchasing, human resources, financial and public relations. In each 
of these functional areas employees are executing their daily tasks, and it is here 
where data is captured and analysed internally.
The information needed by all these functional areas at the different levels 
must be gathered, processed, stored and distributed, communicated or 
shared when needed. Those firms that are quickest at analysing and extracting 
relevant information to use in their decision-making process, usually have a  
competitive advantage.
It is not always possible to gather information; usually only data is gathered. You 
cannot learn much from data. It could be a pile of invoices containing figures or 
just a list of quantities. This cannot be used for decision-making purposes because 
it does not mean anything. Information (converted data) could, for example, be 
the turnover figures for the past twelve months. This information could be used by 
the relevant manager to make decisions.

 
34
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
When building and maintaining information resources to support the information 
needs in a firm, managers face numerous challenges, including: 


the speed of change in information technology


choosing the right system from the many available


finding and retaining staff with the required information skills


increasing information security and confidentiality issues


ensuring positive cost–benefit perceptions and realities


commitment and learning through networking and self-directed research.24
2.6 The requirements of useful information
Information must comply with the following requirements to be valuable to 
decision makers:


Information must be correct and accurate to contribute to effective decision 
making. If this is not the case, incorrect conclusions may be drawn.


Information must be timely. If information is not available on time, it delays 
decision making; it could even be worthless. The longer it takes to trace a 
problem, the more difficult it becomes to correct the problem. Something that 
was a fact yesterday, may no longer be a fact today.


Information needs to be complete. A compromise must be reached between 
conciseness and completeness. It is therefore important to know what the 
specific need is. Partial information can be very misleading.


Information must be summarised where possible and presented in an 
acceptable form. Graphs and diagrams should be used wherever possible. 
Decision makers do not have time to work through long documents.


Information needs to be relevant. A sifting process is necessary. Information 
must be replaced by new information to keep up with changes. Never collect 
unnecessary information. It must be relevant to the problem at hand.


Information needs to be clear, detailed or summarised as required, presented 
in a predetermined sequence and relevant or required format.


The cost of providing information must be relatively economical.


Information must be collected from various quarters so that decisions can be 
approached from various points of view.


Managers need such information and the information function ensures that 
the information is shared with the other functions in the firm.

35
CHAPTER 2 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION IN BUSINESS
2.7 The relationship between the information function and the 
other functions in a firm
As previously discussed, most large firms have different departments or functions 
to deal with different aspects of the business, for example administration, 
marketing and so on. In smaller firms, these functions are often combined and 
one person manages two or even three of these functions. In a one-man concern, 
the owner will manage all the functions. The managers of these functions require 
information to make meaningful decisions.
It is the responsibility of the information manager to make information available to 
the department manager. It is also essential that the information manager is aware 
of the different levels of management in the firm, the types of decisions made at 
each level and the need for management information required at the particular 
level. Only then can useful and relevant information be communicated to the 
different levels and sections.
An information system needs to be created to facilitate the gathering of relevant 
information from all the functions and different levels of management. This system 
must be able to process the information and store it so that it can be extracted 
easily. When the information system has the information stored, it also meets 
the requirements or needs of the different functions. These two aspects must 
be matched by the system. The information manager must make sure that the 
relevant information is sent to those who require it for decision-making purposes. 
This  process must be co-ordinated and managed by the information manager.
If the information is complete, accurate, on time and logical, the average 
management decision will help to improve the business’s performance. When the 
information is inaccurate, unsuitable or obsolete, the decisions cannot possibly be 
any better. The decisions that must be made by the different functional managers 
may be simple or complex. Simple decisions refer to routine decisions that are 
made daily with the minimum of information as input. This type of decision occurs 
at various levels in the hierarchy and requires a specific type of management 
information. The information manager must satisfy these requirements.

3.1 Introduction
Th e impact of information on business really came to the fore as a result of 
the computer revolution of the late 1900s. Th is revolution was started by the 
development of the microchip, which made it possible to build much smaller 
computers, particularly the personal computer (PC) of the late 1970s and early 
1980s. Before then, information was processed manually, which was time-
consuming, error-prone, ineffi  cient and relatively expensive. Th e computer 
made the processing of information quick, easy and cheap. Information became 
a competitive advantage and fi rms with better information are now able to 
outperform their information-challenged competitors. Information became a 
commodity and today there are many businesses which provide an ‘information 
service’ – they gather, process and sell information. Th e computer revolution led 
to the information revolution.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
At the heart of the computer and information revolutions, are the microchip and 
the computer. The microchip, computer and other physical devices that are linked 
to the computer, are together called hardware. The microchip and computer, 
however, are really only devices that can process data extremely quickly (today’s 
Intel i7 computers can process up to 92 billion instructions per second).1 The 
hardware can do this because of its software. Software enables computer users 
to interact with the computer, enter data and extract useful information. Word 
processors, electronic spreadsheets, web browsers, and packages for specialised 
tasks such as accounts management, preparing a presentation and project 
management are just some of the software programs available. Managers are 
constantly looking for the best available software to provide their company with a 
competitive edge.
Single computers on their own, while useful, are not nearly as powerful as several 
computers connected together.  By linking several computers together into a  
network,  the processing power of the computer network can be increased. Each 
individual computer on the network becomes as powerful as the combined power 
of all of the computers together. Data can also be shared between the computers on 
the network, and communication can take place between the different computers; 
this makes business processes and activities more efficient. Separate networks 
can also be combined into ‘super-networks’. The power of the Internet came about 
by connecting millions of computers and computer networks together to create 
the world’s biggest and most powerful network. Modern telecommunications 
technology allows businesses to send and receive information in a fraction of a 
second. People can now work together as if they were sitting next to each other, 
even if they are thousands of kilometres apart. This is made possible by extremely 
fast computers and networks. 
This chapter introduces the hardware and software tools available to the infor-
mation manager. You need to understand the various components or building 
blocks of information and communication technologies. 
3.2 Information and communication technologies
Information and communications technology (ICT) is an umbrella term 
that includes any communication device or application, encompassing: radio, 
television, cell phones, computer and network hardware and software, satellite 
systems, and so on. The term also includes  the various services and applications 
associated with the devices, such as videoconferencing, programming, gaming, 
web design and distance learning.

41
CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES
According to the European Commission, ICT is important because it gives under-
served communities access to information and communication.2 Many countries 
around the world have established organisations to promote ICT and assist less 
technologically advanced areas in catching up with technologically developed 
countries. Because technology develops so fast in developed nations, the economic 
gap will also increase if ICT is not promoted in developing countries. 
3.3 Hardware
Hardware can be defined as the physical components (microchips, printed 
circuit boards, computers, monitors, printers, scanners, hard drives, etc) that are 
combined to make up a computer system. At the core of any modern information 
system, there is at least one computer.
3.3.1 What is a computer?
A computer is a device that can be programmed to process data and provide 
information as output. Computers carry out a list of instructions (called a program) 
which take input – in the form of data – and rework that data to provide output (the 
information). Computers are made up of printed circuit boards, wires, transistors 
and other electronic components. Regardless of the size, age, function, or 
capability, all computers have the same basic components and operate according 
to the same basic principles. 
A computer must handle four basic operations, namely input, store, process and 
output.


The computer must be able to accept data – input.


It must be able to store both the data (the input), and a set of instructions (the 
program) that it will carry out. 


The computer must be able to process the data using the programmed 
instructions.


Finally, the computer must be able to output the information or further data 
generated from the processing phase in a form that can be assimilated by 
humans or other machines.
Components of a computer
In general, every computer has the following components: input devices, a central 
processing unit (CPU), memory, output devices, and external media storage.

 
42
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Input devices
These include all the machines and other apparatus used to enter instructions 
and data into the computer’s main memory. Commonly used input devices 
include:


keyboards


a mouse


trackball or track pad (for point-and-click use)


touch screens 


drawing tablets with a pen stylus


digital scanners.
In some businesses, it is important to input data at high speeds. These 
businesses make use of machine-reading devices such as:


bar code scanners


magnetic ink


magnetic cards (with a magnetic strip as in a credit card)


smart cards (with a chip built into the card – like many credit cards)


imaging devices


speech recognition.
Central processing unit (CPU) 
This is the ‘brain’ of the computer, where all the processing takes place. The 
CPU carries out the instructions (the program) together with the input (the 
data) at very high speeds. It is a silicon chip and, because it is so small, it is 
often referred to as a ‘microprocessor’ or sometimes just ‘processor’. It consists 
of two parts:


The control unit (CU) – This is like a ‘manager’. It decides when and how 
instructions are carried out.


The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) – This is the actual computing device or 
‘calculator’. It takes data and reworks it into different data or information 
(the output).
Memory
At various points in the computing cycle, program instructions and data must 
be stored, at least temporarily and often also for longer times. Common types 
of memory include the following:


Registers – A register is a small data-holding or storage space for data or 
instructions that are currently being processed and still need further 
processing. Registers are the fastest of all forms of storage. The more 
registers a computer has, the faster the computer is.

43
CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES


Internal memory – This is usually referred to as random access memory 
(RAM) and is where the program and data are stored temporarily while the 
computer executes the program. When the computer is switched off, the 
RAM is automatically emptied.


ROM – Read-only memory (ROM)  has instructions permanently written in 
the memory. In other words, you can read from the memory, but you can’t 
write to the memory. Unlike RAM, instructions remain in ROM when the 
power is switched off. ROM memory is usually used for those initial basic 
instructions required to get the computer started or ‘booted up’. 


External memory – This usually refers to the hard drive that one finds in 
the modern computer. Computer programs and data files are stored on the 
hard drive for long-term use. 


Cache memory – This is a very high-speed of internal memory. It is a 
temporary storage space for instructions or data that are often reused.
Output devices
Most computers have a monitor or screen to view the information being 
inputted as well as the resultant output. There are two types of outputs:


softcopy –the picture or words that appear on a monitor or the sound that 
one hears from a computer


hardcopy – information printed on paper.
Other output devices include: printers, speakers, projectors, etc. Printers can 
be classified into two basic types:


Non-impact printers – the most commonly used printer is the laser printer. 
It is called a laser printer because it creates images on a page without any 
mechanism being pressed against the paper; it ‘burns’ the text or image 
onto the paper or sprays an ink onto the paper.


Impact printers – these printers reproduce images on a page using 
mechanical impact.
External media storage
These are external devices on which large amounts of data can be stored or 
‘backed-up’. CDs and DVDs are still in use, but more common examples are 
USB flash drives and SD cards.
The basics of computer communication and language: bits and bytes
Computers use electricity rather than  human language to run or to communicate 
between their components. Every piece of communication inside a computer is 
translated into a string of electrical signals that are in one of two of the following 
states: low voltage or high voltage.

 
44
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
The computer translates these states into an ‘on’ or ‘off’ state. Each ‘on’ or ‘off’ signal 
represents a binary digit. A binary digit is either a 0 (zero) or a 1 (one). A binary digit 
is also called a bit. A string of bits (usually eight or multiple groups of eight) is called 
a byte. A byte is a unit of information used to represent characters such as letters, 
numerals, symbols and punctuation marks. An encoding scheme is a system for 
representing symbols or characters using unique strings of bits. ASCII (American 
Standard Code for Information Interchange) and EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded 
Decimal Interchange Code) are two examples of standard organisations.
3.3.2 Computer categories
The different categories of computers are as follows:


Super computers – These are huge computers with incredible processing 
power. Only a few nations in the world possess such computers and they may 
cost hundreds of millions of rand.


Mainframe computers – These are large and powerful computer systems used 
by big companies and government organisations. Large numbers of users can 
work on a mainframe at the same time. Today, mainframes are often made up 
of a matrix of PCs that are connected together to function as a single computing 
entity. These computers work in conjunction with each other sharing the 
computing workload. It is much cheaper to create a large matrix computer 
system than to establish a mainframe or supercomputer. Companies such as 
Google use matrix computing to handle their processing needs. Nevertheless, 
mainframes still exist in large companies, but they require a lot of maintenance, 
special care and specialised programming in order to do their work. They are 
expensive and struggle to compete with modern-day matrix computers. 


Microcomputers – also known as personal computers (or PCs), these are the 
most common type of computer available today. Even basic PCs are quite 
powerful – as powerful as many of the larger mainframes of times gone by. In 
a network of business PCs, the server is the most powerful machine, which 
‘manages’ the network and contains the network’s software.
3.4 Computer software
In the early days of computers, programming a computer meant actually changing 
the computer’s wiring by opening and closing switches or moving plugs from one 
circuit to another. When the computer was turned on, it would then perform a 
different computation. Programs today consist of instructions written in special 
languages called programming languages. The process of writing programs is 
called programming.

45
CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES
The only ‘language’ that a computer’s hardware can understand is a series of 
on/off electrical signals that represent bits and bytes, discussed in section 3.3.1. 
Together, these provide computer hardware with instructions for carrying out 
certain operations. This basic language is called machine language. 
3.4.1 Application software
An application (or ‘app’) is a program developed to address a specific need or 
software that allows non-programmers to develop such programs. Most programs 
that professionals use are application programs, such as word-processing 
programs, spreadsheet programs, payroll programs, and so on. Programs designed 
to perform specific functions are called application software. Programs that serve 
varied purposes are called general-purpose application software.
Custom-designed applications
Custom-designed (also referred to as ‘bespoke’) applications are developed to 
satisfy the specific needs of an organisation. Custom-designed applications are 
tailor-made for a specific organisation, usually when no other software will do. 
Custom-designed software is very expensive to develop and even more expensive 
to maintain. Only larger firms can really afford to develop customised applications. 
It is only worth developing customised software if the software is likely to provide 
the firm with a competitive advantage of some sort. The alternative to custom-
designed software is ‘packaged software’.
Packaged software
Third-party software vendors now offer a large variety of ‘off-the-shelf’ software. 
These are general applications that have been developed so that they can be used 
by a variety of different firms with easy adaption to fit in with each company’s 
unique needs. Examples of packaged application software is the MS Office suite of 
software (including MS Word, MS PowerPoint and MS Excel), as well as software 
such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe Acrobat, and Oracle. Packaged software has 
multiple advantages.


It saves costs – No ‘high-cost’ development and maintenance work is involved 
in writing such programs.


It improves quality – Because of economies of scale and other efficiencies, these 
programs are very efficient; the developers can put in additional research and 
development expertise that they can offset over a wide number of sales.


The user receives support – The customer can contact the vendor for advice, 
assistance and even training. 


It is immediately available to users – That is why it is called ‘off-the-shelf’ software.

 
46
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Multimedia
Programs that can handle many different types of data-types such as video or 
audio, are called multimedia software. Multimedia technology allows users to 
enjoy text, audio, still pictures, and animation. Multimedia software is used in 
education, training, research and business.
Virtual Reality
Virtual Reality (VR) applications mimic sensory reality using software. They can 
create the illusion of experiencing situations through simulated sight, hearing 
and touch. Sophisticated VR devices provide two important elements, namely 
immersion and interaction.
3.4.2 System software
System software is a program that is designed to carry out general routine 
operations, such as managing the interface between the user and the computer, 
loading a file, copying a file or deleting a file, as well as managing memory 
resources and operating peripheral equipment such as monitors and printers. The 
most common type of system software is the OS software.
Operating systems
The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a 
computer. Computers are powerless unless they have software that co-ordinates 
and manages all the operations on the computer. This core software on a PC is 
the OS. Microsoft Windows is the most widely used operating system on PCs, with 
updated versions being regularly released. ‘X’ (which stands for 10) is currently the 
latest OS for Apple. Other OSs include open-source software (OSS) such as Linux. 
OSS is software that can be downloaded free of charge from the Web. The functions 
of OSs include the following:


managing the user interface


memory allocation


multi-tasking, multi-programming, and multi-processing


times and statistics


user-friendliness.
3.5 Telecommunications in business
Telecommunications is the communication of data and information between 
two devices over a distance. The distance could be a few centimetres or 
thousands of kilometres. The connection between the devices could be wired 
(connected by a cable) or wireless (using radio, infrared or other form of wireless 
technology); sometimes, a combination of wired and wireless connections is used. 

47
CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES
Telecommunications has improved the way in which business is conducted as 
follows:


improved business communication due to computers around the world being 
able to connect with each other


increased efficiency by sharing data at high speed


improved distribution of data by increasing the reach of networks (which could 
include devices such as smartphones, tablets or even fridges, gate motors and 
car engines)


instant transactions using these worldwide networks.
3.5.1 Data communications
Data communications is an important part of the telecommunications infra-
structure. It deals with the transfer of data within a computer, between a computer 
and another device (such as printer or smartphone), or between two computers.
3.5.2 Channels and media
A communication channel is the physical medium, such as a telephone line, 
through which data can be communicated. The capacity of a channel is the speed at 
which data is communicated over the channel. It is also known as bandwidth and 
is measured in bits per second (bps). When the bandwidth is low, the channel is 
known as a narrowband channel. Media with the lowest capacity, such as copper 
wire, are said to have base-band capacity. Broadband channels are capable of 
transmitting several streams of data simultaneously, which makes the channel 
capacity very high.
A channel is also called a medium. A medium is anything through which data can 
be transmitted. A guided medium is one with physical channel-like cables, while an 
unguided medium has no physical channel, for example, air. This type of medium 
allows for wireless communication. There are various types of transmission media. 
These include:


Twisted pair cable – a traditional telephone line is made of a pair of twisted 
copper wires that act as a single communications link. The wires are twisted 
to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can alter voice and data 
and make them unclear.


Coaxial cable – this cable is often called TV cable because it is commonly used 
for cable television transmission.


Microwaves – high-frequency, short radio frequency (RF) waves. Short radio 
frequency waves can carry signals over long distances with high accuracy. 
Bluetooth and infrared are examples of microwaves.

 
48
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS


Optical fibre – fibre optic technology uses light instead of electricity to represent 
bits. Fibre optic lines are made of thin fibre glass filaments.
A repeater is a device that receives a transmission signal, strengthens the signal, 
and then sends the signal on. A repeater is what you would use at home if you 
have a wireless ADSL device that does not reach to all the parts of you home. By 
installing a repeater, you can ensure that the entire house receives a strong signal.
3.5.3 Modulation
Several years ago, the widespread communications networks comprised a huge 
web of twisted-pair telephone lines designed to carry voice communication 
and analogue signals. Recently, however, business demands and technological 
progress have resulted in the same lines being used to transmit computer data, 
which is digital in nature. Modulation is the process of converting a digital signal 
into an analogue signal. The reverse process is called demodulation. Modulation 
is executed by a modem. The word ‘modem’ is an abbreviation of modulator/
demodulator. In the world of modems, a ‘multiplexer’ is a communications device 
that allows several telephones or computers to transmit voice or digital data 
through a single line.
3.5.4 Networks
A network is a combination of devices (at least two computers or devices) 
connected to each other through one of the communication channels discussed 
above. Two common types of networks are LANs and WANs.
The layout of a network is referred to as its topology. In the case of a local area 
network (LAN) the distance between the devices is quite small, for example 
within the building. A LAN is usually confined to a radius of approximately 5 km.
A wide area network (WAN), on the other hand, is a computer network that 
crosses organisational boundaries and they have much longer distances that  
they can cover. WANs can be public or private. The Internet is an example of a 
public WAN.
3.6 Managing ICT
Today, even small firms have computers, peripheral equipment, software and 
networks. These ICT assets need to be carefully managed to ensure that they are 
an asset, or at least an advantage, to the firm. If these ICT assets become a liability 
(if they are old, break down often or create communication problems), the firm 
can be in serious trouble and may even fail as a result. The management of ICT is 

49
CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES
a very important issue that definitely requires forethought and careful planning. 
This management task could be undertaken by  the firm’s owner, by an ICT-literate 
staff member, or by an ICT specialist.

After studying this chapter, you should be able to:


Explain the systems concept


List the objectives of a system


Identify the characteristics of an effi cient information system


Modify an existing information system



Identify different types of information systems in a fi rm and explain the integration 
of these systems. 
4.1 Introduction
Information is collected from outside as well as from inside the fi rm. Internally, 
information is collected from the diff erent organisational functions, departments 
and management levels. Because the whole organisation is involved, all staff  and 
all levels of management contribute to the eff ectiveness and effi  ciency of the 
information system. Like all the other managers in a fi rm, the information manager 
must manage the available resources eff ectively. 
Most fi rms implement information systems that make it possible for the 
information manager to manage information and reach the information objectives 
productively. Th is chapter focuses on the implementation and/or modifi cation 
of information systems. Th e objectives of information systems, as well as the 
characteristics of an effi  cient information system, will be discussed. Diff erent 

 
52
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
types of information systems are required to meet the needs of different business 
objectives, specialities and levels. Implementing, modifying and integrating 
different systems will also be discussed. 
4.2 What is a system?
A system is a set of procedures that must be followed in order to achieve a goal. 
A procedure consists of steps to follow to perform a specific task; these steps are 
consecutive (follow a particular order). A method describes how each step of a 
procedure is completed. A large system can be broken down into subsystems.1 
(See Figure 4.1.)
Let us use the firm as an example to explain these definitions. The firm as a whole 
can be seen as a system, while the functions of the firm (administration, marketing, 
production, purchasing, human resources, finance, etc) are the subsystems of the 
firm. Each one of these functions, taken separately, can also be seen as a system by 
itself with subsystems.
If the information function, for example, is the system, then the different sections 
or divisions within the function will be the subsystems. These sections could 
be programming, facilities, network operations, user assistance and strategic 
planning and research. Within each subsystem, there are certain procedures and 
methods that must be followed to ensure the effective and efficient functioning of 
that section. In the mailroom, for example, certain procedures must be followed 
when dealing with incoming mail. The procedures could be:
1. 	 Receive mail.
2. 	 Open mail.
3. 	 Date-stamp mail.
4. 	 Sort according to section.
5. 	 Distribute mail.
Each of the above procedures consists of specific methods to execute each step. 
These usually differ from one firm to another. The method for receiving and 
opening mail could be the following:
1. 	 Fetch the mail at the post office before 10:00 every morning.
2. 	 Separate confidential and personal mail for delivery.
3. 	 Open the rest of the mail.

53
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
A system includes all the people, technology, machinery and facilities that form 
part of that specific unit. A system can be open or closed. An open system interacts 
with its environment; a closed system is self-sufficient and can exist independently 
of a particular environment. The information function is an open system because 
it functions within the firm (its environment) and is interrelated with all the other 
functions of the firm, as well as the external environment. Figure 4.1 illustrates a 
basic system with all its components.
FIGURE 4.1 The design of a system2
Let us look at this systems concept in a practical way. The firm is the system. 
Everything inside the firm is part of the system and can be seen as the internal 
environment (internal subsystems). It is also an open system because it interacts 
with the external environment (clients, suppliers, customers, etc). These could 
also be seen as the external subsystems of the firm.
Because of this interaction, transactions are recorded between the internal and 
the external subsystems. Data is transferred between the subsystems to facilitate 
co-ordinated actions relating to the clients, suppliers, customers or other agencies. 
The internal subsystems support all the internal operations of the firm. This 
includes cost accounting, budgetary control, planning, etc.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
A system can also be based on the value-chain approach, which shows the linkages 
between the various activities in a firm. These activities can be categorised as 
primary and supporting activities.
Primary activities include the following:3


Inbound logistics


Production


Marketing and sales


Services and support
Support activities include the following:


Organisational infrastructure


Management of human resources


Technology development


Procurement of resources
The linkages between the various activities can be characterised by the following 
features:


Each of the primary and support activity groupings develops its own 
information system to be sufficient to support the operations of the activity.


Within each of these groups, there are a number of information subsystems.


The subsystem within each group relies, not only on information generated 
within the group, but also on information provided by the other groups’ 
information systems (ie through the linkages).


Certain systems operated by the support activities encompass the whole firm 
and require the input of information from each activity, eg the budgetary 
control system.


The information system may be based on either manual or computer 
processing. The transmission of information may be undertaken either 
formally or informally and use a variety of media.
4.3 The objectives of a system
There are different objectives for developing and using a system. Quible identifies 
the following major objectives:4


maximising the efficient use of the organisational resources


controlling the operating costs


improving the operating efficiency


helping to achieve the objectives of the firm


helping to carry out the various functions of the firm.

55
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
As you can see from these objectives, there are obvious advantages when using 
a system. If we look at systems in a firm, it is hard to imagine any organisation 
functioning in any other way. The functions of the firm are co-ordinated through the 
system concept. Managers know where their input comes from and who is affected 
by their output, and therefore better control is possible and total efficiency in the 
firm is improved. However, it is important that managers identify any inefficiency 
in their subsystems and change them to avoid the ripple effect through the system 
as a whole. These changes must be communicated to all those who could possibly 
be affected.
4.4 The elements of a system
All systems consist of the following elements:


In any system, there is an input of some sort. Input involves capturing data that 
enters the system to be processed. The data resources could be from inside or 
outside the firm.5 Input includes the staff performing the tasks as well as the 
equipment needed for the tasks.


To become useful information, the input or data must be calculated, analysed, 
classified, counted, grouped, sorted, compared, evaluated, summarised or 
prepared as graphs. This is called processing. It converts the input into an 
output. One of the basic objectives of the information function is to convert data 
into information. This runs parallel to the objective of computer information 
systems, which is to transform data into information.


Once the data is processed into useful information, it needs to be stored until 
needed by decision makers. Today information is mostly stored electronically.


Processing is done in a certain manner and produces a specific outcome called 
the output. The output has to be in the required form and specified quality to 
meet the need of the user (the ultimate destination). Often this output becomes 
the input of the subsequent subsystem.


There is usually some mechanism in a system to provide feedback. Feedback is 
the data concerning the performances of a system. It can be regarded as output 
that is returned to the appropriate members of the firm to adjust, correct, 
refine or supplement the original data.6 The amount of feedback required is 
determined by the importance of the system for the survival of the firm. The 
more important the system or the desired output, the more important it is to 
have proper feedback. Feedback is necessary to determine whether the desired 
input is received, the proper processes are executed and the required output is 
available. Feedback is received as a controlling measure to make sure that the 
system remains effective and efficient.


Control involves monitoring and evaluating feedback to determine whether 
a system is achieving its goals. The control function initiates adjustments to  
the input and processing components to direct the activities towards reaching 
the objectives.7


Some firms also include the environment and communication channels as 
elements of information systems. The firm has to interact with the environment 
and this interaction needs to be identified and assessed. Communication 
channels need to be recognised and the most appropriate channels selected 
in terms of volume and quality of data transmitted.
These elements will probably be found in most systems. Although the information 
manager will have to manage different systems in a firm, the focus will be on 
the information system and we will use the information system as an example 
throughout the rest of this chapter. Richie et al describe the main activities of 
information systems as follows:8


Identify potential available data


Collect data 


Process data


Store data


Distribute data


Identify users of data.
According to Lessing and Scheepers, information systems consist of basic resources 
that work together to produce information (as an output).9 These are:


Data – These form the input in the systems model. The data resources in 
information systems can be organised in various types of bases such as 
database, knowledge base and model base. 
•	
A database is a collection of related data files and holds data in a structured 
format. It can be accessed and used in various different applications. 
•	
A knowledge base is part of an expert system that is designed to analyse 
data, identify patterns and propose decisions. 
•	
A model base comprises analytical tools such as models that express 
business relationships and is used in a decision support system, where it 
could include sophisticated tools such as built-in spreadsheets, statistical 
analysis and simulation.


Hardware – These are all the physical devices and materials used in 
information processing. It includes the computer system (motherboard, CPU, 
memory chips, etc), computer peripherals (keyboard, mouse, screen, etc) and 
telecommunication networks (communication devices).

57
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS


Software – These include all sets of information processing instructions, 
programs for computer instructions and procedures for human instruction. 
The following classification is used: system software (operating systems such as 
Microsoft Windows), application software (for a specific use such as a payroll 
program) and procedures (instructions on how to use a package).


People – Here we find users (end-users or clients) and information professionals 
who develop, implement, operate and maintain information systems. Lessing 
and Scheepers mention the following categories of information system 
professionals: business analysts, system analysts, analyst-programmers, 
programmers, database administrators, network professionals, support 
professionals, computer operators and information system auditors.10 


Procedures – Procedures are to people what software is to hardware. These 
are the rules, descriptions and instructions for how things are done. They are 
often found in instruction or user manuals and they describe how to use the 
hardware, software and data.


Communications – This could refer to the connectivity between hardware 
to ensure optimal functioning. Computers (hardware) communicate with 
one another through components controlled by software. Communication 
between people could also be included here. 
4.5 The characteristics of an efficient information system
An efficient information system that uses the latest technology has the potential to 
give a firm a major advantage over its competitors. However, gaining an advantage 
does not happen automatically. There are certain factors that are considered 
essential to the success of a system. These are:


the technical quality of the system


the participation and involvement of users in the system design


the capability and the skills levels of the users 


the support from top management.
Furthermore, an effective information system should satisfy certain requirements. 
It must supply decision makers with information that is new and relevant. Managers 
do not need information that they are already familiar with. They need information 
that leads to action, or that is essential for background study regarding a certain 
issue. To provide information that satisfies these requirements, an information 
system must have the following characteristics:


The output must facilitate decision making. It is important that the system 
must serve the purpose for which it was intended.

 
58
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS


Data must be processed effectively. For this to happen, adequate control must 
be exercised over the entire process as well as the hardware and software used.


Data must be managed effectively. Files must be updated regularly, data input 
needs to be accurate, and an adequate security system needs to be in place to 
ensure the integrity of stored data.


The system must be flexible to accommodate special or unusual circumstances.


The system must be adaptable to accommodate changes within the firm or 
new technology. The system should be able to continue to function when 
changes are made.


The system should be systematic and logical.


Interaction between components needs to be organised and co-ordinated.


The system must be user-friendly so that the tasks can be performed effectively 
and efficiently. It should be as simple as circumstances allow.
Technology is increasingly included in the design and operations of information 
systems. According to Quible, a web-based workflow will increasingly be used 
for knowledge management and the processing of documents.11 Even ‘push 
technology’ will be incorporated, where information is delivered to users without 
them requesting it. An example of push technology is when an employee makes 
a mistake on an electronic document; the software identifies the mistake and 
sends it back to the employee for correction. Procedures will also accommodate 
technology-based collaboration, using email and collaborative software.
The software used to facilitate the technologically integrated procedures must 
facilitate the delivery of tasks from one person, department or management level 
to another. Existing data must also be accommodated and facilitated in the system.
Although we have discussed the characteristics of an efficient information system, 
the information manager cannot change or modify the system at any time. This 
type of action needs to be managed properly.

59
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
4.6 The implementation and modification of information systems
If a firm has an information system, it must be managed. If the current information 
system is out of date, it must be modified to meet the present needs. If the firm 
does not have an information system but needs one, the firm needs to design 
and implement one. The management, modification and implementation of the 
information system are the responsibilities of the information manager.
A new information system should be designed within a planned framework and be 
created from the ground up. It is not wise to patch together different subsystems. A 
firm usually develops information systems when management finds that the firm 
is not competitive, or when the existing system no longer meets the firm’s needs. 
Organisations could also consider designing a new information system when 
they realise that such a system could boost their productivity and increase their 
income, when there is a problem that can be solved by using information systems, 
or when government forces them into such action. Developing such a system is 
not so simple. It requires a thorough understanding of the existing processes and 
a vision on how a firm should operate. It also requires discipline, knowledge and 
excellent communication skills.12
Before an information system is developed, it must obviously be planned. The 
planning phase provides the framework within which the information system 
will be implemented. Once the decision is taken to implement a new system, the 
process of developing it will begin. This process is called a systems development 
life cycle.
When designing and implementing a new system, a series of steps must be 
followed. Oz distinguishes between the following four major phases:13


Phase 1: Analysis


Phase 2: Design


Phase 3: Implementation


Phase 4: Support.
4.6.1 Phase 1: Analysis
This phase consists of a five-step process that is designed to answer the following 
questions:


How does the existing system (if there is one) work?


What is the purpose of the system?


Is there technology to meet the need?


What resources are needed?

 
60
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS


Will the benefits outweigh the costs?


Will its intended users use the system appropriately?


Will the system be used to its full capacity?


What features does management want the system to have?


What interfaces will the system have with other systems?
The analysis phases consists of five steps as follows.
Step 1: Investigation
During this step, it must be determined whether there is a real need for an 
information system. A small committee consisting of system analysts, some of 
the intended users, as well as the manager leading the initiative, will perform a 
preliminary investigation. The committee interviews and spends time with the staff 
to determine the present system in use and the problems the users encounter. A 
written report about the information gathered is given to the requesting managers. 
The opinions of the committee members are also given. They may even indicate 
that a new information system is not justified. However, if they decide to continue, 
a larger committee is formed to investigate whether the proposed system is feasible 
technically, economically and operationally.
Step 2: The technical feasibility study
The system will be feasible if its components (such as software, hardware and 
telecommunications) exist or if they can be developed with available tools. It must 
be determined whether the system can be built and whether it will be able to run 
on existing hardware. Additional hardware will obviously increase the cost.
Step 3: The economic feasibility study
The development of the system must also be economically justified. The committee 
must determine whether the benefits will outweigh the costs over the life of the 
system. A spreadsheet including all the costs and benefits over the projected time 
period can be drawn up. The most accurate method of economic analysis is return 
on investment (ROI), which is a calculation of the difference between the stream 
of benefits and the stream of costs over the life of the system, discounted by the 
applicable interest rate. This method will not be discussed in more detail, as the 
committee will use a specialist in this field to do the calculations.
Step 4: The operational feasibility study
The purpose of this study is to determine if the system will be used as intended. 
The system should not interfere with the policies of the organisation or any 
government regulations. All the intended users must be able to use the system to 

61
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
its full capacity. It must also fit into the culture of the firm (for example flexible 
working hours and staff who work from home).
Step 5: Requirements definition
Once management accepts that the system will be feasible, a project team is 
established. A project leader is nominated and, together with management, puts 
together a team that will develop the system until it is ready for delivery. Such a 
team usually includes the following people: system analysts, programmers and 
representatives from the departments that will form part of the system.
The analysts need to know the system requirements, that is, what the system 
should be able to do and the means by which it will perform its tasks. To collect 
this information the following methods can be used: interviews, questionnaires, 
examination of documents and on-the-job observation.
All the facts are recorded and presented to the users and their managers. The users 
study these detailed requirements to confirm that it is what they need. Developing 
clearly defined requirements is a crucial time in the development process. It is not 
cost-effective to make changes once the system is in operation. Keep in mind that, 
at this stage, specific hardware and software have not yet been chosen. 
4.6.2 Phase 2: Design
Once the requirements are known, the project team can commence with designing 
the system. The team must evaluate alternative solutions and specify the hardware, 
software and communications technology for the chosen solution. The purpose of 
this phase is to satisfy all the requirements identified in Phase 1.
An information system is an aid to managers. The designer and user must keep the 
following in mind:


More information is not always better. In fact, the vast amount of information 
has become more of a problem today.


The computer can only give back what it has received. Although it can do 
complicated calculations, human judgement is still crucial.


The newest technology is not necessarily the best. The technology that meets 
the need is the best.
According to Oz, this phase consists of four steps.14 One step describes how the 
system will work logically, the next step describes the physical layout and the last 
two steps deal with the construction and testing of the system.

 
62
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Step 1: Logical design
During this step the team determines the following components:


the input files that will be used to capture the input data


the procedures used to process the input


the output files that will capture the processed data as well as the files that will 
record input by all the other users of the system


the user dialog which is the way the users will interact with the system


the interfaces which will enable users to interact with other systems.
The design phase is often a complicated and complex task. To assist with this phase 
designers make use of flowcharts and data flow diagrams. There are also software 
programs available to create graphical interpretations of information systems.
Step 2: Physical design
The physical design includes the software and hardware needed for the system. 
Regarding the software, always look for a software package that can satisfy the need 
before developing your own software. This can save you a lot of time and effort.
Step 3: Construction
Construction is predominantly programming. Programmers design a program to 
facilitate the input, processing and output of the system. Every subsystem is tested 
once the programming for it has been completed. This is usually done by walk-
through and simulation.
Step 4: Testing
The entire integrated system is now tested. The results are compared with the 
system requirements as defined in Phase 1. The quality, output and processing 
times are measured. It is also good to try and get the system to fail and to try 
different things to see how the system reacts. Any flaws must be identified during 
this stage.
4.6.3 Phase 3: Implementation
The implementation phase consists of two steps: training and conversion.
Step 1: Training
One cannot assume that everyone knows how the system works. The users of the 
information system must be trained. Different methods can be considered for 
training. The most common way is to give the users the background and basic 
information regarding the system and its functioning in a classroom situation. 
Thereafter the users are trained on the job. The trainers assist the users at their 

63
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
workstations. This, however, could be time consuming, especially if there are 
many users to be trained. It is good to consider using software packages specially 
designed for self-training. Users can train themselves at their own pace. This frees 
the trainers to attend to other business or assist those who experience problems.
Step 2: Conversion
This is the process of switching from the old to the new system. On the one side 
users have to get used to the new system and on the other side it often happens 
that system problems arise once the system is in full operation. These problems 
were not or could not have been detected earlier. This is usually a time in the 
organisation when productivity goes down temporarily, processes may be delayed 
and data may be lost.
Oz describes four conversion strategies designed to manage the transition:15


The parallel conversion – The old system is used along with the new system for 
a predetermined period of time. If the new system fails, the old one is there to 
fall back on, but it is expensive to run two systems concurrently.


The phased conversion – The subsystems or modules are phased in one at a time. 
The risk of this method is fairly low, but the benefit of using the new system is 
delayed. Users, however, have time to learn the system as it is introduced.


The cold turkey conversion – The old system is stopped and the new one 
is introduced. This is inexpensive, but risky. The benefits are realised 
immediately.


The pilot conversion – The new system is introduced in only one unit until all 
the problems are sorted out and it operates effectively. It can then either be 
introduced to other units or not used at all.
4.6.4 Phase 4: Support
Support includes two main responsibilities: maintenance and user help. 
Maintenance consists of solving and rectifying any problems that still arise, and 
making changes and additions. Once a system is running, management might 
discover that they need more information about a certain aspect or that they need 
other units to be included. Setting up a help desk is one way to provide advice and 
guidance to users. 

 
64
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
4.7 Tools to assist systems and procedural changes
If you have to change an existing system or if you are involved in the development 
of a new system, there are a number of tools that can assist you. 
4.7.1 A workload chart
A workload chart or work distribution chart is used for developing efficient systems 
and for simplifying work processes (see Quible16 for an example). A workload chart 
will identify the following information:


the major activities performed by a business unit


the amount of time the unit spends on each activity


the activities performed by each employee and the time taken to complete the 
activities.
The information provided here could assist in identifying areas of inefficiency and 
should be corrected before developing a new system. The workload chart shows 
what the work unit is supposed to do, highlighting any duplicate operations, 
related tasks, time taken for the major functions, productivity of the workforce, and 
work flow. This information is collected over a typical work period of one or two 
weeks, where the employees are involved in collecting this data.
4.7.2 An office layout chart
Quible also describes an office layout chart that is used for visualising workflow.17 
An office layout chart can be used to improve workflow (which is also a subsystem 
of the information function) in the firm.
When an office is planned or re-organised, it is important to consider the 
relationship between people, equipment and the flow of work. In this regard you 
need to:


Use your floor space effectively.


Create a pleasant working environment for yourself and others.


Create a positive impact for visitors.


Organise your work area for effective workflow.


Provide for effective work areas.
To improve operations in your office it is essential that procedures flow in the 
simplest and most effective way. This is established by investigating the existing 
system and making the required changes to it. To help you with this, you can make 
use of an office layout chart.

65
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
An office layout chart shows the location of the office workers and the way work 
moves from person to person. You can use arrows to indicate and connect all these 
movements, which will provide you with a type of ‘rope diagram’ (see Horsfall and 
Cairns for an illustration).18
Say, for example, that there are two people in the office. If there is a lot of 
crisscrossing of arrows, the office layout needs to be improved so as to also improve 
the workflow. Some rules regarding this are:


Avoid crisscrossing and backtracking.


Enter, walk around once and exit.


Follow a circular route of the least distance.
You could move the furniture around and draw arrows for the movements to see if 
you can find a better solution to increase the efficiency in the office.
Other tools that are also available include: 


The right- and left-hand chart – Used to identify hand movements in a particular 
work process.


The operator-machine process chart – Used to study the relationship between 
and operator and the machine that is used. Its use is primarily limited to 
analysing high-volume, repetitive work processes.


A horizontal flow process chart – Illustrates work processes that involve 
multicopy forms. These charts follow the movement of each copy of the form, 
starting with the point of origin, moving through the various steps in the 
workflow and ending with the disposition of each copy of the form.
4.8 Different types of information systems
Within the firm, there are many different types of systems and information systems. 
The type of system that is used will be determined by:


the level of decision making (strategic, tactical or operational)


the use of information (planning or control)


the source type and application


the destination of the information (internal or external).
An information system mostly consists of many subsystems. Each of these 
subsystems has its own goal and reason for existence, but operates within the 
bigger system and serves the firm as a whole. To classify information systems is 
not so simple. As new uses are found for computer-based information systems 

 
66
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
so new categories of information systems are developed. Laudon and Laudon 
differentiate between the following four main types of information systems that 
serve the three different organisational levels:19


transaction processing system (TPS)	
(Operational level)


management information system (MIS)	
(Management level)


decision support system (DSS)	
(Management level)


executive support system (ESS)	
(Strategic level)	
4.8.1 Transaction processing system (TPS)
These are the basic business systems that serve the operational level of the firm. 
A TPS is a computerised system that performs and records the daily routine 
transactions necessary to conduct business.20 Examples of these activities are 
sales, receipts, payroll, hours worked and the flow of material in a factory. The 
main purpose is to track the flow of transactions through the firm and to answer 
routine questions. The information here is used to manage the operational level 
activities in the firm.
These systems can only carry out the tasks for which they are designed and cannot 
be changed easily by the user. When designing such a system it is important that 
the programmers understand the exact need of the users. The system must do 
what the users require. The inflexibility of these types of systems was one of the 
reasons for the development of more advanced systems that could support the 
decision-making process of managers.
4.8.2 Management information system (MIS)
The MIS serves the management level of the firm, providing managers with reports 
and possibly with online access to the firm’s current performance and historical 
records.21 These systems give an overall view of the functioning of the firm and 
usually provide periodic feedback in report form. This information is used for 
control purposes. An example could be a report for the month regarding the 
budget, noting where actual costs exceeded budgeted costs.
The MIS is specifically designed to use information technology (IT) to meet 
the information needs of lower and middle managers as they make a variety of 
decisions on a day-to-day basis. The MIS provides managers with information 
they need to carry out their function. It generates regular performance-monitoring 
information, maintains co-ordination and provides background information about 
organisational activities. This can take the form of routine management reporting 
or ad hoc decision support.22

67
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The MIS usually draws its data from the database of the firm. The analytical power 
of the MIS is limited and data is usually just presented in a form that makes it more 
meaningful than raw data. The MIS does not directly support the decision-making 
process but makes information available that managers use to base their decisions 
on. The MIS usually provides the internal information of the firm about its past 
performance. The system does not do any forecasting itself. Databases from which 
the information is gathered must be updated first before the MIS can provide the 
information to managers. This can cause a delay in the decision-making process. 
Computer-generated reports are an important part of the MIS.
Different subsystems exist to supply information to functional managers. The 
subsystems are the marketing, production, purchasing, human resources, financial 
and accounting information systems. The data and information regarding the 
operations of these functions are recorded and transferred to a database. Each 
function supplies the information regarding its own operations. The information 
regarding each function referred to here was discussed in chapters 1 and 2.
Some information processed or gathered by each organisational function is only 
for its own use. However, there is also information that needs to be supplied to the 
other functions for them to function effectively. An example of this is the financial 
function that has to supply information to all the other functions regarding the 
budget. Each function needs to draw up a budget and this cannot be done without 
getting guidelines regarding the financial situation. Another example is the human 
resources function supplying all the other functions with information on the 
policies of the firm. If you look at the information needs as described in chapter 
2, you will see that some of this information can be obtained internally from 
other functions. This information will be included in the MIS. Any confidential 
information will obviously not be available to the other functions and will only be 
available to the specific user.
4.8.3 Decision support system (DSS)
A DSS is also found at the management level of the firm. It uses special software to 
allow users to interact directly with a computer to help make decisions for solving 
complex and sometimes unstructured problems. The DSS has arisen from an ever-
increasing need for information system support in non-routine, non-repetitive 
uncertain situations where success criteria are by no means clear. It was developed 
to overcome the rigidity of the MIS with its reporting structures and limitations.

 
68
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
The DSS can be used in a number of different ways, such as in financial services 
where insurance agents need to structure sales situations and respond to clients’ 
requests by choosing the best combinations from a set of options. An example of 
analytical use of DSS would be the consideration of product range, price, sales, 
advertising, etc to assist the marketing manager in planning and in monitoring 
results by consulting various models and databases.23
The DSS does not provide the decision, but provides information about different 
options that the manager will use to make the decision. The DSS can be used very 
effectively where the virtual office is in place. The DSS has also been improved 
to facilitate group decision making. Different people in a firm work together on 
the same problem using software called groupware. They all work on the same 
file or database on a computer network. They all participate in the decision-
making process without seeing one another. This is especially useful in firms doing 
business nationally and even globally, where managers are situated in different 
geographical areas. This system is called a Group Decision Support System (GDSS).
The main characteristics and capabilities of a DSS are to:


provide support for decision makers in either unstructured or semi-structured 
situations by combining computerised information with human judgement


increase the number of alternatives


enhance different levels of managers’ understanding of the business


enable more rapid response to unexpected situations


enhance teamwork by providing support to all involved


improve management control.24
Some firms also make use of an expert system. This system is more advanced than 
the DSS and is capable of arriving at a decision when certain facts are given to it. 
The system is programmed to select specific options when receiving certain inputs. 
When designing such a system, you need a specialist in the field of application to 
assist the developer/programmer. Data about the specific field are collected from a 
specialist and placed in a database. Managers can then extract this expertise when 
a problem arises. Once the system is in operation, you need not be a specialist to 
use the system.
Organisations also make use of network systems called Intranets and Extranets. 
These systems are computer networks that link different people in the firm and 
allow them to communicate electronically and share databases. Information can 
be transferred and shared by these computer linkages. The system can also be 

69
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
expanded to link computers of firms in different localities and even in different 
cities all over the world. Information can be moved very quickly from one locality 
to another.
Extranets are computer networks that make use of the Internet to communicate 
with the external environment. Information is transferred between two or more 
firms by using inter-organisational information systems. This also forms the basis 
for electronic commerce and e-business. They are also major components in the 
computer-based linkages between a firm’s suppliers and/or customers.
4.8.4 Executive support system (ESS)
Senior and top managers use executive support systems to make decisions and 
serve the strategic level of the firm. They address non-routine decisions requiring 
judgement, evaluation and insight. ESSs create a generalised computing and 
communications environment rather than any fixed application or specific 
capability. The focus is on long-term trends, internally and externally. External 
changes must be noted to adjust internally and thereby remain competitive. 
Examples are the long-term industry trends and future products of the industry.
The system gathers information from many different sources and this information 
is put on an IT system. This system must be user-friendly so that these managers 
do not spend all their time trying to operate the system instead of just getting the 
information they need.
The information must of course be relevant to the decisions they need to take. 
This information will be on matters such as competitors, the economy, politics, 
customer needs and government rules and regulations. The information must be 
presented graphically where possible and summarised to save time when working 
through it. Detail must be available on request. This system makes use of the 
available databases, internally and externally, as well as a database specifically 
designed for this purpose.
4.8.5 Serving the functional areas
The systems at the different levels are specialised to serve each of the functional 
areas, such as sales and marketing, manufacturing and production, and human 
resources. A system is not necessarily used only by one section or level. It is possible 
for a middle manager to get information from a TPS. Let us look at the finance and 
accounting systems as an example.

EXAMPLE 4.1: Information systems for the financial function
The financial function is responsible for managing the firm’s financial assets (cash, bonds and 
investments) as well as the capitalisation of the firm (finding new bonds, and other forms of 
debt). In order to determine whether the firm is getting the best return on their investments, they 
need a lot of information from external sources. The accounting section maintains and manages 
the firm’s financial records. Table 4.1 summarises the types of systems required.

Systems are often developed as stand-alone units and are not linked to other 
systems in the firm. System integration looks at a firm as a whole and at the needs 
of the firm. System analysts then look at the possibility of integrating the different 
systems within the firm so that information can flow between them and that this 
information can be made available to all the users with any of these systems.
4.9 The integration of systems and flow of information
As we have shown, each function in the firm could be seen as a system on its own. 
Although each function is managed individually, they are still part of the firm and 
must function interdependently as integrated systems. Each functional manager 
has to produce certain outputs in order for the firm as a whole to be profitable.
The question is: ‘Who must take care of this integration?’ We can generally say 
that this is the function of top management, but each functional manager is also 
responsible. Each functional manager, for example, cannot do planning in isolation. 
There is no use in expanding one of the functions without informing the human 
resources function. Who will recruit and employ the necessary staff? The matter will 
therefore be facilitated if a team approach is followed in the management process.
To ensure successful integration and co-ordination in the firm, the following 
requirements must be satisfied:


There must be mutual co-operation between individuals and the different 
functions.

71
CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS


Each function and its subdivisions must be aware of their share in the goal of 
the firm. 


Each function must be flexible and able to adapt to changing circumstances.
We will briefly look at the integration of the functions in a firm:


The information function  – The information manager plays an important and 
pertinent role in the integration and co-ordination of the different functional 
divisions. It is his/her responsibility to ensure that the information required by 
the different functions in the firm reaches them at the right time. To ensure this 
it is essential that the functional divisions also send the required information 
to the information manager at the right time, so that he/she has enough 
time to process the information and ensure that the correct information is 
available at the right time for the other functions. The data manager and the 
information systems manager can assist the information manager. The data 
manager gathers information through observation and measurement. The 
data comprises the unprocessed primary facts, which cannot be used in their 
present form by the decision makers. The information systems manager now 
processes the data, in other words, places the data in context and makes it 
available to the functional divisions of the firm. This aspect requires that the 
information system be designed in such a way that integration be allowed with 
the sections of the firms with which it works closely.


The marketing function – The marketing strategy selected by the manager is 
very important since it often reflects the overall strategy of the firm. Together 
with the financial and information managers, the marketing manager 
must consider the capital needs implications of the marketing policy and 
marketing strategy. A large scope of marketing costs may have a beneficial 
effect on credit sales, but at the same time the accompanying capital needs 
may influence the profitability of the firm negatively. The purchasing manager 
and the production manager must also be aware of increased sales so that the 
necessary precautionary measures can be taken.


The production function – Production is the key function in the firm because it 
is the process whereby input is converted into valuable output. The production 
manager must plan and control his/her activities according to the marketing 
budget and the production capacity and he/she must determine the extent to 
which the different processes must be integrated. The strategy to be followed by 
the production manager can also be regarded as an extension of the marketing 
strategy. The production manager therefore depends on information from the 
marketing, information and financial managers. The production manager in 
turn must provide the purchasing function with information on resources and 
materials required.

 
72
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS


The purchasing function – The purchasing manager bases his/her policy to be 
followed in the division on information he/she obtains from the information 
or information function. The information concerns the suppliers, delivery 
times, quality and scope of requirements, storage space, production needs and 
rate of consumption. These and other factors influence the cost and capital 
needs of purchases and stockholding. Based on quality of service, punctuality 
of delivery and quality of raw materials, the production function will also serve 
the purchasing function in selecting the right suppliers.


The human resources function – The human resources manager is in control of 
the most important resource in the firm, namely people. The manager requires 
information from the different functions on staff matters (such as additional 
staff required) and training needs. According to the needs of the different 
functions, employment, career development, career guidance, performance 
appraisal and training will be initiated by the human resources function. To 
ensure uniformity in the firm, the human resources function must also provide 
guidelines to all the other functions of the firm on trade union relations and 
discipline.


The financial function – The financial manager must be aware of the capital and 
financial needs of the other functions, so that the correct funds are available at 
the right time at the lowest cost. This information is reflected in the position 
of debtors, creditors, cash and stock. The financial manager must therefore 
know what the priorities are for capital allocation projects. He/she must also 
be aware of what levels of capital allocation can be made by the operating 
managers without permission from their superiors.


The external relations function – All the different functions must provide the 
external relations manager with information on opportunities as well as 
threats. Opportunities can be used to improve the external image of the firm. 
Negative publicity in turn must be avoided when there are threats. Steps must 
be taken in good time to avoid the threats. The external relations manager can 
thereby attempt to maintain good external relations with his/her consumers; 
wholesalers; retailers; competitors; local, provincial and government 
authorities; financial institutions; trade unions and the community in which 
the firm operates.
The functions can be described as a number of mutually dependent subsystems, 
parts or procedures and methods that work together towards a common goal. 
Within each function you need to get the work done in a co-ordinated way and 
according to certain standards, such as quality, quantity and time. For this you 
need procedures and methods that need to be followed by the staff in the different 
functions.

CHAPTER 4 INFORMATION SYSTEMS
4.10 Summary
The continuing development in information technology and applications thereof 
bring in many opportunities for improvement of information systems and the 
more efficient use of information. Latest technologies are also being used more 
and more by firms in order to stay competitive, especially in the global market. 
Even firms that have not used technology in the past are now using it. E-business 
(electronic commerce through the Web or Internet) is also a growing force in the 
economy. Some firms have been transformed to accommodate this development. 
Databases are becoming more powerful and telecommunications technology is 
changing to accommodate inter-organisational trading and trading between the 
firm and the consumer and/or supplier. The Web will probably also be used more 
in the future to accommodate workflow, processing of documents and making 
information available. The increasing amount of technological integration used 
in designing operating systems and procedures is responsible for the evolution 
of what is known as knowledge management. Basically, it involves providing 
information to the right persons at the right time. 
 Self-assessment questions
1. 	 Explain the relationship between systems, subsystems, procedures and 
methods. Use examples applicable to your work environment to illustrate your 
answer.
2. 	 List the objectives of a system.
3. 	 You have to explain to your top management what you think an effective 
information system is. What would you tell them?
4. 	 Discuss the different types of system at the different levels of an organisation 
and give examples of each.

5.1 Introduction
In this chapter, the focus moves to the online world. 
Dave Evans, Cisco’s previous Chief Futurist, suggests that the Internet is one of the 
most important and powerful creations in all of human history.1 Today, many – if 
not most – of us could not envisage a world without the Internet. Already there are 
more than 3 billion people (about 42% of the world’s population) that have access 
to the Internet, and that number continues to grow. Driven by social media, email, 
e-business, e-learning, online gaming, and a multitude of websites, the online 
world is a key part of most people’s lives today. Th e Internet is a computer network 
and the term ‘online’ is used to refer to being connected to this network.

 
78
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
In this chapter we begin by defining the Internet and the Web. We provide an 
idea of the current size of the Internet and where the Internet is going and its 
likely impact on businesses. We introduce the concept of the ‘Internet of things’ 
and we highlight the benefits of being online. We introduce the concept of the 
new economy and identify the drivers of the new economy. We briefly discuss 
e-business, e-marketing, e-commerce, social media and the mobile world, 
before focusing on the role of information in the online world. We specifically 
discuss search engines and other sources of online information, before ending 
the chapter by touching on how to manage online information, thus leading in 
to the last chapter.
5.2 The Internet and the Web
The online world is built using a number of building blocks. The first of these is 
the Internet and the second is the World Wide Web, simply referred to as ‘the Web’. 
Finally, more recently, there is the mobile world of cellular phones. In this section, 
we briefly introduce and define these three concepts.
5.2.1 The Internet
The Internet (often just called the Net) is most commonly defined as a worldwide, 
interconnected network of computer networks. 
The Internet enables a computer or network in one part of the world to communicate 
with a computer or computer network located somewhere else in the world, using 
either an ordinary telephone line or a special dedicated data line.
FIGURE 5.1 The Internet – a network of computer networks

79
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
The power of this global system of interconnected computer networks comes from 
the fact that:


It provides easy access to one another for billions of individual and corporate 
Internet users.


The information available on all of these computer networks is now available 
to everyone.


It provides a fast and affordable communication channel for users. 


Individuals and firms can now do business across the Internet relatively easily.
Previously, only users on a specific network had access to the information on 
that particular network. Of course, much of that information is still owned by 
individuals or organisations, and thus password-protected. Nevertheless, there 
remains gigabyte upon gigabyte of information freely available via the Internet. 
5.2.2 The World Wide Web
The World Wide Web (or simply the Web) is a way of looking at and organising the 
information that is transmitted across the Internet. Although these terms are often 
used interchangeably, they actually refer to two different things. The Internet is the 
underlying infrastructure for the online world, whereas the Web is its interface. We 
are really working with the Web when we are online, and the Internet is allowing 
us to work with the Web. 
The Web is basically a subset or part of the Internet, and organises information 
according to pages – more than 4.3 billion of them – that lie all over the Internet.2 
These pages are interlinked using hypertext, also called hyperlinks. In other words, 
each page is connected to other pages, that are connected to other pages, that in 
turn are connected to still more pages, and so on.

 
80
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Other websites
FIGURE 5.2 Inter-linked pages on the Web
The Web was created in 1989 at CERN, Switzerland’s nuclear research facility, 
by Tim Berners-Lee. The term ‘Web’ was coined in 1990 to describe information 
spanning the planet like a giant spider’s web, with threads linking knowledge and 
information from all over the globe, making it available to a worldwide audience.
There have been few developments in the modern world that have grabbed the 
imagination of people across the globe as the Web has done. In the complex world 
of technology, the Web is easy to use. There are few commands necessary, as the 
Web incorporates a simple ‘point-and-click’ environment using your mouse. The 
Web incorporates multimedia features such as pictures, sounds, animations, 
photographs and video, adding to its attraction and intuitiveness. 
It also provides access to a greater range of topics from more sources than any 
other single information system on the planet. It doesn’t matter whether you’re 
operating an Apple computer, a PC (personal computer), a Unix operating system 
or some other type of computer; the Web is about compatibility. The concept of 
hypertext allows users to explore different ideas and topics on different webpages, 
without having to follow a linear train of thought.
As a businessperson, the Web will be the tool that you will probably use the most. 

81
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
Webpages, websites and home pages
We have said that the Web is made up of pages – called webpages – that are linked to 
each other using hyperlinks. A website is a collection of webpages which typically 
cover a common subject area. The first page of a website is termed the home page.
FIGURE 5.3 Websites and home pages
Hyperlinks and hypertext
Hypertext is a way of linking documents together. By clicking on a word or picture 
on a webpage, you are automatically transported to some point in either the same 
document or in another document. The other document may be located on the 
same computer, or on a computer situated in another country halfway across 
the world. On this second document, there may be more hyperlinks to other 
documents located elsewhere on the Internet. 
All the information on webpages (the text, graphics, photographs, buttons, pictures, 
etc) is edited in such a way as to be viewable in a special software program called 
a web browser. This editing is done using an editing or ‘markup’ language, called 
HyperText Markup Language (HTML). HTML adds specific tags – also called 
hypertags – to the text and graphics, such as bold, page breaks, centre, underline, 
table formats, hyperlinks, etc. Figure 5.4 provides an example of the HTML code 
underlying a typical webpage.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
FIGURE 5.4 What HTML looks like and the resulting webpage (press control + U to see the HTML)
The term hypertext was invented by Ted Nelson in the mid-60s to describe his 
vision of information linked together within a document. Hypertext has become 
the foundation stone of the World Wide Web. 
Web browsers
A  web browser is a software program that provides access to the information on 
the World Wide Web. It allows the user to navigate (or ‘surf’) from one webpage or 
hyperlink to another; it is essentially a ‘window’ through which the information 
on the Internet and the Web can be seen. Using a web browser such as Microsoft 
Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, the hypertags that are 
embedded in a webpage are interpreted by the browser and they control the way 
the information is presented on your computer screen.

83
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
As of November 2014, the most popular web browser in use is Google Chrome, 
with just over 60% of the market share. Its strongest competitor is Mozilla Firefox 
which has 23.4% of the market. The rest of the market is divided up between 
Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera, and other browsers.3 Most browsers are available 
as free downloads from the Net.
Web addresses and URLs
There is a standardised addressing system for all webpages on the Internet. It is 
important to note that every webpage has its own unique address (when someone 
gives you a website address, they are in fact giving you the address of a website’s 
home page). This web address is called the universal resource locator (URL) and 
looks something as follows: http://www.dti.gov.za/policy/mission.htm
The URL is made up of different components. These include the following:


the tool the web browser uses to get to the target page


the address of the computer the webpage is on (called the computer’s domain 
name)


the specific instructions necessary to find the page on the computer concerned, 
such as the directory and subdirectory paths


the target file name.
The first part of the URL indicates whether it is a hypertext or another type of Internet 
resource such as file transfer protocol (FTP). Recall that earlier in this chapter we 
said that the Internet comprises different ‘parts’ or ‘tools’ and mentioned FTP and 
Telnet as examples. In most instances, these facilities are also accessible using 
your web browser. The web address (ie URL) will reflect the facility being used, 
that is, whether it is FTP, Telnet or perhaps a secure webpage (indicated by the 
prefix ‘shttp’). 
The second part of the address indicates the target computer where the file is 
located. The next part of the address, which may consist of one or more levels, 
indicates the directory and subdirectories in which the actual target file is located. 
The last part of the URL indicates the actual file name. Each part of the URL is 
separated by a forward slash (except for the first part which is separated by a colon 
and double forward slash).

 
84
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
EXAMPLE 5.1: Web addresses and URLS
We will analyse these three examples.
Example 1: http://www.ireality.co.za/sport/skyrider/Welcome.html
Example 2: ftp://sun.su.ac.co.za/marketing/direct/plans.txt
Example 3: http://www.ireality.co.za
Example 1
http:// = a Hypertext Transfer Protocol file and contains hypertext links
www.ireality.co.za/ = the address (domain name) of the target computer
sport/skyrider/ = the directories and subdirectories in which the target file is located
Welcome.html = the name of the target file (Note that the file extension, while commonly .htm, 
may sometimes be .html – you must type in the URL exactly as it is.)
Example 2
ftp:// = a File Transfer Protocol file
sun.su.ac.co.za/ = the address (domain name) of the target computer
marketing/ = the directory in which the target file is located
direct/ = the subdirectory in which the target file is located
plans.txt = the name of the target file
Example 3
http:// = a HyperText Transfer Protocol file and contains hypertext links
www.ireality.co.za/ = the address (domain name) of the target computer
Although there appears to be no file name in this URL, there will be a default file name 
associated with the address (in the above example, it is http://www.ireality.co.za/Welcome.html, 
although it might be ‘home.htm’, or ‘index.htm’, or something similar). In fact, by typing in http://
www.ireality.co.za/Welcome.html, you will arrive at the same home page as if you had typed in 
http://www.ireality.co.za.
5.2.3 Mobile technologies
When we refer to ‘mobile’ in this book, we are referring to cellular technologies. 
The first commercial mobile networks started appearing in South Africa in the 
early 1990s, but have grown tremendously since then. Today, South Africa is one of 
the most connected countries in the world, with almost 60 million devices in use 
in the country (more than one device per person).
Initially, the mobile phone was exactly that – a phone. The user could make a call 
and do little else. These basic telephone devices could not initially send or receive 
SMSs. SMS stands for Short Messaging Service, also known as text messages or 
text messaging. It was the SMS feature that turned the modern mobile phone into 
a powerful business and marketing device.

85
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
SMSs are short, 160-character text messages that can be sent across the cellular 
network. The first test SMS was sent in 1992 and the first commercial SMS service 
was introduced in the mid-1990s, with worldwide adoption occurring only in the 
latter part of the 1990s. The power of SMS is that it is an affordable, effective, fast 
and asynchronous communication system. It is affordable; bulk SMSs costs as 
little as 30c–75c per message. It is effective because its brevity forces the sender 
to get to the point quickly. It is fast because when the message is sent, the receiver 
receives it a few minutes later. The asynchronous nature of SMS means that the 
receiver doesn’t even have to have their cell phone on when the message is sent; 
if the target phone is off, messages get stored until the recipient switches on their 
phone, at which point all the stored messages are sent through to the phone.
As mobile technology has evolved, so the services and facilities available on these 
phones have grown and improved. Today, these simple cellular phones that were 
capable only of making calls, have developed into smartphones – phones that have 
computer-like features and that can create documents, deliver presentations, view 
videos, play games, surf the Web, and much more. What is more, as the number of 
smartphones on the market increases, so their prices decrease and so they become 
more commonplace. Soon, everyone will have a smartphone and businesses can 
leverage business value off the features that these smartphones offer them.
For many years, mobile technology was seen as the ‘baby brother’ of the other 
e-marketing tools. However, the development of smartphones has led to the 
emergence of apps, small software applications intended to do very specific 
tasks, found on most smartphones. These can be found on most smartphones. 
Together with the introduction of other mobile devices such as tablets and ultra-
light laptops, generally referred to as Ultrabooks and Netbooks, the use of mobile 
devices as business tools has grown exponentially in a very short period.
Interestingly enough, the mobile network that we know is essentially a radio 
network. The radio signal is transmitted from a cellular device such as a cell phone 
to a nearby transmitter–receiver (transceiver) tower, called a base station or cell 
site. It is then transmitted to another tower, and then another, until it reaches and 
is received by a designated or target cell phone, which may be located anywhere on 
the globe. These towers are connected together in imaginary ‘cells’, each served by 
one or more transceiver towers. They are located next to each other and are usually 
within sight of each other, thus enabling the radio signal to be passed on from one 
tower within a cell to another tower within a nearby cell – hence the name ‘cellular 
network’. In cities, these transceiver towers are probably about half a kilometre to a 
kilometre away from each other, while in rural areas that can be as far away as eight 

 
86
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
to ten kilometres from each other. This suggests that the cells are much smaller in 
cities than in rural areas. Geographical features such as seas, rivers and mountains 
mean that the cell system is not feasible for transmitting these signals between 
different countries. Instead, the signal is sent by satellite to a corresponding 
network in another country, and from there across their cellular network to the 
destination cell phone. Incredibly, all of this takes place in milliseconds. 
Cellular systems and cellular connectivity has gone through several levels or 
generations of sophistication since they were first introduced. These generations 
of sophistication are called 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G. The second generation of cellular 
network, namely 2G, was a digital network and most countries around the world 
bypassed 1G and started off with 2G. In fact, today about 90% of the world has 2G 
coverage.4 One of the big developments associated with the digital 2G networks, 
and one that has had a profound effect on mobile marketing, was the introduction 
of the SMS. Being digital, the 2G network also made it possible to send and receive 
digital media such as ring tones which became a big business for ringtone and 
other media providers. 
The move to digital and the demand for data forced cellular developers to upgrade 
their networks from 2G to 3G. The main difference, between the two is the capacity 
to handle data, especially in terms of speed. This, in turn, has gone hand-in-hand 
with the introduction of smartphones with computer-like data handling capacity 
that can be used to access and surf the Web, create, edit and read MS Word, 
Excel and PowerPoint documents, enable PDF document viewing, application 
processing, as well as video viewing, audio playback, and more. Currently about 
45% of the world (including southern Africa) has 3G coverage.5 
The latest generation of cellular service is 4G (also sometimes referred to as 
Long-Term Evolution or LTE), which has not yet been widely adopted. The 
main difference between 3G and 4G is the speed of data transmission and data-
optimised 4G networks are expected to be between four and ten times faster than 
3G. This will have a major impact on the role that cellular devices play in accessing 
the Web and for marketing purposes. One can expect cellular devices to become 
the primary means of accessing online services in the near future.

87
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
5.3 The size of the online world
The size of the Internet is estimated at about 2.9 billion people worldwide, or 40% 
of the world’s population, as at July 2014.6 In 1993, approximately 14 million people 
(or 0.3% of the world’s population) were connected, an increase of 19 000%.

5.4 The future – the Internet of things
As the ever-present Internet continues to grow, supported by wireless, radio and 
mobile technologies, so we move to a world encapsulated in the ‘Internet of things’. 
This term refers to a world where ‘things’ (ie objects of all types) are connected to 
the Internet using tiny wireless or radio frequency sensors embedded in the objects 
in question. These objects could be refrigerators, sunglasses, spectacles, cars, your 
pets, watches, clothing, water pipes, electrical plugs, credit cards, money, homes, 
beds, lights, plants, and even humans. With microscopic (but powerful) sensors 
embedded or attached to these objects, having the ability to send and receive 
information to wireless networks, it becomes possible to track, record and analyse 
almost everything we use and do. 

 
88
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
While many of these networks already exist (think of the modern car engine and 
all the monitoring systems that exist in the car), these are not yet connected to the 
Internet. When this happens, these tiny networks can begin to talk to each other 
and share the information that they gather. For example, it would be possible 
for a refrigerator to track how often you use the device, how long the door stays 
open, what products you keep in the refrigerator, how often and when you use 
these products, and much more. This information can then be sent to the Internet 
and captured by the refrigerator manufacturer. They would analyse the data and 
build better products and services based on this information. They could sell this 
information to a milk carton manufacturer who could, in turn, manufacture a 
better milk carton that is optimised for the number of times it is used. 
Google Glass is another example of the Internet of things. It is a wearable pair of 
spectacles (that could be specially made for your vision), but that has a computer 
chip connected to the Internet embedded in it. With Google Glass, you can have a 
tiny Web screen displayed on the inside of one of your spectacles so that you can 
access the Internet and get real-time information about the things you are looking 
at (history, location, cost, specifications, availability, etc). You can also record what 
you see and send that immediately to a social media site such as Facebook. Think 
of the both the business possibilities that this technology offers firms, as well as the 
ethical implications of being able to instantly record everything you see. Google 
Glass is not science fiction; it is already available today. There is even talk about 
embedding this technology into contact lenses.
The Internet of things opens up a new world of opportunities but also translates 
into a gigantic leap in the amount of information that will be captured, processed, 
analysed and used. The question is how this growth in information will be managed.
5.5 Information and the benefits of the online world
Why have the Internet and the Web proved so successful in business? Together 
they have some unique advantages that make them powerful business tools. These 
advantages include the following:


Large amounts of information can easily be stored and updated on the Internet 
and are accessible to anyone connected to the Internet.


Information that is normally filed away as paper-based documents and only 
made available to a limited audience because of the cost involved in wider 
distribution, can now be made available quickly and easily to all interested 
parties – a much wider, international audience.


Any information disseminated on the Web by a firm is immediately available 
to a global audience.

89
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD


The information can be presented in multimedia form, including text, sound, 
video, photographs and animations, making it very user-friendly.


The information is interactive – the reader can complete a reply or order form, 
send an email message to the company concerned and can also navigate 
between sites located at the opposite sides of the globe.


A web-based document and its contents can be linked by hypertext to a wealth 
of supporting documentation also available on the web that may be spread 
across the world.


Information on the web is available 24 hours a day and 365 days a year.


The Web is easy and intuitive to use.


The Web is an affordable environment to use for both the user and supplier of 
information and services.


The Web allows you to reach the masses – a market of just over 3 billion users 
presently, expected to rise even further.


The Web allows you to customise your information for one user.


You can transact sales directly on the Web.
5.6 The new economy
Over the centuries, humankind has gone through 
several reformations. During this time – from the 
earliest days of civilisation, through the many 
empires and revolutions, until today – technology 
has played a role in what we do and how we live. 
Every time a new technology comes into play, 
civilisation turns the corner on the road to a 
new era. This was the case with fire, the wheel, 
the printing press, the industrial revolution, 
It is common to talk about 
‘e-something’, such as e-commerce, 
e-business, e-economy, e-literacy, 
etc. The ‘e’ stands for ‘electronic’ 
and has to do with the new 
electronic world of microchip 
technologies and online activities. 
Many companies are striving to 
copyright and to brand names that 
have the ‘e’ in them; there is clearly 
an e-revolution on the go!
the motor car, the aeroplane, the computer revolution, and is also the case today 
with the e-revolution embodied in the new economy.
The difference today is that we are so much more in tune with what is happening 
around us. With the Industrial Revolution, most people were still tilling the lands 
and few even knew that the Industrial Revolution was taking place. Having entered 
the new millennium, a large portion of the world’s population is at least aware – 
through television, radio, print media and the Internet – that there is a revolution 
happening. The impact of the new economy on humankind, therefore, is more 
palpable than ever before.

 
90
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
What is more, the new economy is not an attempt to create a separate universe, 
as was the case with communism, for example. Instead, it is an evolution 
stemming from the late twentieth century’s vital centres. Forces acting on this 
new economy include the proliferation of computers, technologies enabled by 
the microchip, networks, wireless technologies, television, telecommunications, 
rapid globalisation, the elimination of barriers to trade, the Internet and the online 
world, the growth in cellular technologies and smartphones, nanotechnology, 
mobility, and the Information Age. These forces are generally referred to as the 
drivers of the new economy. Of course, the arrival of this new era has been nicely 
timed (albeit, not deliberately) with the arrival of the new millennium. 
FIGURE 5.6 The drivers of the new economy8
5.7 E-business, e-marketing, e-commerce, social media and  
mobile technology
From a business perspective, the online world can be divided into a number of 
overlapping groupings. These include e-marketing, e-commerce, e-business, 
e-tailing, e-learning, social media marketing, and even e-government. Although 
e-learning and e-government is not strictly speaking business, they do impact on 
business directly.


E-marketing – this addresses the use of the Web as a marketing channel. 
E-marketing encompasses using the Web to create websites that facilitate 
marketing in one or another. As such, e-marketing is a fairly broad and inclusive 
term. E-commerce, e-tailing, social media marketing and email marketing 
are generally all subsets of e-marketing, or at least overlap with e-marketing 
to some extent. At the same time, e-marketing can be said to be a subset of 
e-business, an even broader concept.

E-business – this is the broadest of the descriptions that one will find to 
describe the online world and includes all of the other categories. E-business 
can be defined as doing business electronically (or online). E-business not 
only incorporates e-marketing and all of the other groupings, but it also covers 
the integration of businesses electronically and online. Thus in the instances 
where two companies that work together as business partners integrate their 
information systems using the Web as the means to do so, this is considered to 
be an example of e-business.


E-commerce – in the early day of the Web, e-commerce was the favoured term to 
describe all online commercial activities. In recent years, e-commerce is more 
commonly used to describe online transactions, where products or services 
are purchased and paid for online. Thus, today e-commerce – the result of the 
sale of goods online – can be seen as overlapping with e-marketing. As there 
are also many instances of transactions not related to marketing that take 
place online, e-commerce is not entirely a subset of e-marketing but rather 
overlaps it. An example of this would be where businesses make automated 
transactions online as part of a supply chain process, without there being any 
direct marketing context. E-commerce is definitely still part of the broader 
e-business world.


E-tailing – when sales are conducted online either by a bricks-and mortar 
retailer, or by an entirely virtual store. These entities are evidenced by websites 
that generally look like an online shop – visit www.yuppiechef.co.za to see an 
example. E-tailing is a subset of e-commerce and of e-marketing.


Social media marketing – Social media marketing is another form of online 
marketing which seeks to ‘plug into’ the social interactions between online 
individuals. Almost all social media interactions are facilitated by third party 
web-based services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and blogs. 
As such, social media marketing can be seen as a subset of e-marketing. 


Mobile technology – The mobile world, although not directly embedded in the 
Internet, is closely aligned to the online world and there is direct information 
sharing and integration between the Internet-based technologies and mobile-
based technologies.
5.8 Information and the online world
5.8.1 The Web as a source of information 
We must always remember that the main function of the Web has traditionally been 
to provide information and to serve as a channel for communication. The Web is 
vast. It is host to a myriad of information resources that provide access to a wide 
range of information. Finding your way around the Web is a bit like ﬁnding your 

 
92
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
way around a new city. You need to establish a plan of action before you get there or 
you could risk getting lost. In both cases, there are a few questions you may want to 
ask yourself: Where am I going? Why am I going? What will I ﬁnd when I get there? 
Taking time to think about these questions before you begin your online travels 
can save you a lot of time and effort and will give you a better chance of finding all 
the things you want to see. One thing that can help you get orientated on the Web is 
to be aware of the different resources you will ﬁnd. There is a wide range of online 
or web-based resources in the ﬁeld of business and management, and different 
resource types offer different kinds of information. 
Types of online resources 


Business and management journals – Many of the key printed business and 
management journals are also now available in electronic format on the Web, 
but some require payment for access to them. 


Papers and documents – Many papers, documents and articles written by 
business experts can be found on the Web. 


Databases – Many business and management databases can be found on the 
Web, including bibliographic databases and library catalogues. 


Organisations – Most business and management organisations have a Web 
presence that contains information about their activities, aims and research. 


Mailing lists – Mailing lists and discussion lists are available in many areas of 
business and management. They offer students, researchers and lecturers an 
opportunity to discuss topics with fellow professionals. 


Educational materials – Interactive teaching and learning materials are now 
available on the Web. These can take many forms; from lecture notes to 
tutorials, to online quizzes, and video clips of business practices. 


News services – These are provided by a range of sources, such as large 
broadcasting news services (including the BBC and CNN), online newspapers 
(such as The Times and The Guardian), and specialised business and 
management news services (like FT.com and London Business News). 


Discovery tools – There is a wide range of search tools available on the Web that 
enables you to ﬁnd information. These vary from search engines and subject 
gateways to Web guides, library catalogues, portals and directories.
In the next section, we focus on one of the main sources of online information, 
namely search engines.

93
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
5.9 Search engines
Search engines are computerised programs that slowly crawl through the Web 
detecting all the pages of available information on a particular website, indexing 
all of the information on these pages into a databank, and then listing these in 
databases that users can search through – hence the name ‘search engine’. Search 
engines retrieve lots of information. For example, if you enter the word ‘Zulu’ using 
Google, at least 55 million matches are found in 0.21 seconds (interestingly enough 
in the year 2004, the same search on Google generated only about 200 000 results 
in 0.14 seconds – bear in mind that searches will change in size as the web grows). 
Search engines allow the user to type in keywords, which are then compared 
against the search engine’s database. The search engine retrieves documents 
from the database that match the keywords. Many users believe that when they 
run a search it is being done live in real time. However, this is not so. All search 
engine databases contain information that was compiled some time previous to 
the search. Hence, the 0.14 second response time. There are many search engines 
available online, including, among others, Google, Bing, Excite, and Yahoo. 
As of November 2013, Google was the most used search engine on the Web with 
just over 67% of market, ahead of Bing (18%) and Yahoo (11%).9 Google indexes 
billions of webpages so that users can search for the information they desire, 
through the use of keywords and operators. Google has also employed Web 
search technology in other search services, including Google Image Search, 
Google News, Google Product Search (a price comparison site), Google Groups 
and Google Maps. 
The main purpose behind search engines is obviously finding information. From 
a business perspective, search engines can be used to find business information 
that can be used as secondary information about market information, customers, 
competitors, business opportunities, suppliers, service providers, and intermediaries. 
This means that a firm can always be kept up to date with current developments in all 
aspects of their business model. They can access information about their consumers’ 
world through sources such as government, universities and commercial websites 
that report on demographic and survey data of the population. The particular data 
that might be of interest to the consumer-related aspects of the business include: 


the general structure and characteristics of the consumer market 


product and media consumption habits 


media trends 


changes in market values such as disposable income, needs and trends.

 
94
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Alternatively, search engines can be used to obtain information about the activities 
and strategies of its competitors. Such information is invaluable for planning a 
competitive strategy and for attaining a sustainable competitive advantage. This 
information can be obtained through search engines by looking at websites of 
competitors, searching the websites of trade associations, as well as the archives of 
news services or interacting with consumers and competitors in newsgroups and 
mailing lists. 
5.10 Beyond search engines
Search engines are not the only way to find information online. Firms and their 
staff can also browse the Web by following links from one site to the next looking 
for information (also referred to as ‘surfing’). This is an extremely unreliable 
means of ﬁnding information, as it is unplanned, unstructured and can be 
misleading. Browsing is also time-consuming and it can cost huge sums of money 
to remain connected to the Web. Browsing is a haphazard yet interesting way of  
ﬁnding material, although good quality starting webpages usually give rise to high 
quality links.
Often you ﬁnd new site names in newspaper articles, journals and magazines. 
Sometimes colleagues may refer you to new sites. Generally, these make a good 
starting point, as they have been tried and tested with regard to useful information. 
Popular sites are excellent sources for information or at least as a starting point 
for your online information search. You should not be ashamed to start your 
data collection at your competitor’s website. The competitor’s site could provide 
information, such as the vision, mission, management structures, products and 
services, and ﬁnancial reports. For example, if Sanlam wanted information on 
Old Mutual, what better place to start than at www.oldmutual.co.za? From this 
webpage, you can obtain information about Old Mutual in South Africa, and the 
company worldwide. The Old Mutual in South Africa website provides detailed 
information that competitors would be interested in. 
Alternatively, you could join discussion groups and newsgroups. There are literally 
thousands of discussion groups on the Web that engage in debate and that 
share knowledge on various topics. In some instances, these groups are hosted 
by leading academics and experts, who add to the authenticity and credibility 
of the information. Participants in a discussion are free to ask questions speciﬁc 
to their problems. Newsgroups offer a broader range of topics than discussion 
groups. Newsgroups are electronic bulletin boards that hold online discussions 
on many topics. This enables virtual communities to be formed according to their 
interests. Discussion group mailing lists are very similar, but here the individual 

95
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
does not visit a bulletin board. Instead, the messages posted are sent directly to 
the email inboxes of subscribers. Researchers can give expert advice on these 
newsgroups and gather valuable information, such as the desires of consumers 
and their opinions of different businesses and products, and ﬁnd respondents for 
conducting online surveys. 
Another source of good information is the information portal. This is a large site 
created and managed by third party individuals around specific (often narrow) 
topics. In other words, portals are gateways to other sites containing information 
related to a particular topic. For example, www.exporthelp.co.za is an information 
portal about exporting in South Africa and serves as an excellent place from which 
to start your information search. 
An alternative to a search engine is a search directory. In the early history of the 
Web, directories were quite common, but today the speed and power of automated 
software has superseded the human power of directories (that are collated and 
maintained mainly by humans). Yahoo Directory and the Open Directory are two 
examples that still remain. In directories, authors and editors list their documents 
in subject directories. Unlike search engines, subject directories do not contain 
all the text within a document. Instead, they use broad or general terms, such as  
titles and descriptions of articles. Business.com is another good example of this 
type of directory.
Still another option is the searchable database. These are generally closed-access 
(often paid for) search services that serve only the people who have access to them. 
One such example is EBSCOhost. However, there are searchable databases that 
are in the public domain. Searchable databases have special search facilities to sift 
through masses of data and create matches. The information on these databases 
generally cannot be aggregated by normal search engines such as Google as they 
don’t have permission to search and index the databases of such services. 
5.11 Evaluating online information
After conducting a search, you are often faced with pages and pages and ﬁle 
upon ﬁle of information, some of which may be of doubtful quality and doubtful 
origin. In order to take proper decisions, information has to be credible, accurate, 
reasonable and accompanied by support (referred to as the CARS checklist).10 
5.11.1 Credibility 
When determining the credibility of a document, you have to interrogate the 
author’s credentials and the evidence of quality control. The author’s credentials, 

 
96
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
such as qualiﬁcations, employer, job status and years of experience can play a role 
in determining the credibility of a document. The work of highly qualiﬁed authors 
working for reputed organisations tends to be more credible. Furthermore, if the 
document has undergone some review or editing process by reputed editors it 
has greater credibility. Documents that are anonymous, lack evidence of quality 
control, do not have a list of references and are poorly presented with spelling and 
grammatical errors should be avoided. 
5.11.2 Accuracy 
When determining accuracy of information, you have to consider the detail of 
the content, how recent the information is, reference to other credible sources, 
and whether statements and factual content can be backed up by these sources. 
More detailed documents show that the author has applied his or her mind to 
the subject. Old information that has not been updated in the last two or three 
years may no longer be accurate. Referencing is important in ensuring accuracy. 
Works that have been properly referenced can be compared with previous work to 
determine the accuracy of the current work. Documents that merely state opinions 
without being backed up with facts and empirical evidence should not be trusted 
as being an accurate representation of facts. You should guard against documents 
without dates, documents that have old dates in ﬁelds where information is 
regularly changing, links to other documents that no longer exist, and statements 
that cannot be backed up with statistics and facts.
5.11.3 Reasonableness 
Reasonable information is tempered with fairness, objectivity and consistency.11 
An author reviewing a company, product or service must be fair in criticism. Not 
only the negative, but also some merits in what the organisation is doing should be 
emphasised. In being objective, the article should look at all sides of the issue, and 
the author should not allow personal bias to prejudice the report. An author who 
swings from one extreme to the next and contradicts himself or herself is being 
unreasonable, and the document should be treated with grave suspicion. 
5.11.4 Support 
All documents must be clearly referenced in order that readers can read the source 
documents for a greater understanding of the subject. Links to discussion groups, 
related sites, PowerPoint presentations and other online resources add to the 
credibility of a document. The presentation and format of the document is also 
an important consideration. Documents should be user-friendly and easy to read.

97
CHAPTER 5 INFORMATION IN AN ONLINE WORLD
The CARS checklist12 is by no means the only method for evaluating online 
information. However, it provides a valuable framework for the competitive 
intelligence department to improve on, or to develop its own evaluation technique. 
Even after applying a technique, such as CARS, some organisations end up with 
piles of information that seems to be authentic but really is not. 
5.12 Obstacles in the way of gathering online information
There are a few important obstacles to Internet marketing research just as in any 
other method of marketing research. However, this does not mean that it is not 
usable. It means that people should be on the lookout for these obstacles and plan 
to overcome them, for example: 


Information overload – Any person who has been exposed to the Internet for a 
while and tried to surf and use the search engines will realise the abundance of 
information that it contains. There is simply too much to consume and use. It is 
impossible to go through all the information and analyse or use it. Businesses 
must therefore plan how this information will be screened to get the best from 
it. 


Not all information is useful – Much of the information included in the overload 
of information found in Internet searches is irrelevant. The researcher must 
know how to sort out the valuable information. Intelligent agent software that 
learns your likes and dislikes is becoming more powerful and increasingly 
available to everyone.


The speed of the Internet – Using the internet is faster than other ways of 
gathering information. However, any researcher must always make sure that 
he or she has the latest and fastest affordable technology. In South Africa, 
there tends to be a problem with bandwidth, but the new ISDN lines have 
brought a welcome relief. 


Reluctance by respondents to divulge information over the Internet – Respondents 
are sometimes hesitant to divulge information over the Internet, especially if 
it is of a private nature and if they have not yet built their conﬁdence in the 
privacy and security of the Internet medium. Researchers must emphasise that 
the information will be treated conﬁdentially and stress the security measures 
of the website. 


Many people are still not on the Internet – This is a very valuable point, 
especially in South Africa. This causes biased results for researchers when they 
are gathering data. But you must remember that if you want information about 
your online market, all you need are the online people. 

 
98
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS


The importance of information in organisations is growing in stature – Some 
managers recognise that information is an important resource in achieving the 
bottom line, while others view information as a strategic resource that will give 
them a competitive edge over their rivals. 


Disinformation – Just as your firm wants to secure an advantage over your 
rivals, so your rivals want to secure an advantage over you. It is very likely that 
the target competitor would be aware of your firm’s information gathering 
efforts and could make all possible efforts to thwart or jeopardise these efforts. 
Providing false or misleading information has long been recognised as a tool 
of governments and military organisations in order to gain an advantage over 
their adversaries. This adversarial culture has spilled over into the corporate 
environment, where companies intentionally generate online disinformation 
to mislead the efforts of competing organisations. In fact, your information-
gathering activities may ﬁnd data that the competitor has planted so as to 
keep the organisation preoccupied and off-balance or distracted. Incorrect 
or incomplete information is also used to disrupt a competitive intelligence 
programme. You need to guard against disinformation by checking and 
cross¬checking their sources with other sources of information. A rule of 
thumb would be to treat all information with suspicion and to interrogate it 
thoroughly before using it.
5.13 Managing information in an online world
The biggest challenge for a business wanting to maximise their use of the online 
world is how to manage the huge amounts of information available to them. Many 
companies are intimidated by this challenge, and instead wait a long time before 
‘going online’. In so doing they lose out to other companies. In the next chapter we 
touch on the management of digital and online information.
5.14 Summary
In this chapter we began by defining the Internet and the Web. We provided an 
idea of the current size of the Internet and where the Internet is going and its likely 
impact on businesses. We introduced the concept of the ‘Internet of things’ and 
we highlighted the benefits of being online. We introduced the concept of the new 
economy and identified the drivers of the new economy. We briefly discussed 
e-business, e-marketing, e-commerce, social media and the mobile world, before 
focusing on the role of information in the online world. We discussed search 
engines and other sources of online information, before ending the chapter by 
touching on how to manage online information, thus leading in to the last chapter.

6.1 Introduction
In the earlier chapters of this book, the role of and importance of information was 
discussed. It was emphasised that the importance of information in a business 
cannot be underestimated in our modern society. In this chapter, we move into the 
realm of management. According to Chen, Snyman and Sewdass, organisational 
success depends on the effi  ciency and eff ectiveness with which a fi rm can 
manage its information.1 Although the value of information and its management 
is sometimes underestimated, it is vitally important. Th e information manager, 
who is responsible for the management of information in the fi rm, needs to be 
equipped with the right knowledge and skills to fulfi l this function eff ectively.
Duff y off ers a possible reason for the underestimation of the value of information 
and highlights the link between information and knowledge management:2
“[P]erhaps the most fundamental reason why the importance of the offi  ce of 
twentieth-century society has always been underestimated is that much of 
what it generates is … invisible – certainly to the outside world. Information

cannot be seen. In a materialist century, if you expect something to 
be noticed and talked about, immateriality is, not surprisingly, a grave 
disadvantage. Yet today, more than ever before, offices are essentially all 
about knowledge, the highest form of information, and the most precious 
commodity we have.”
This chapter investigates the nature of information and aspects of information 
management, such as document management, mail management and forms 
management. The nature of information is discussed in terms of its impact on 
the management of information. The role of information management in general 
management is identified. This chapter also looks at the function of information 
and the management thereof in knowledge management.
6.2 The nature of information: a management view
Decision making comprises the choice of various possibilities. Since all 
management decisions are taken based on the available information, the 
availability of information can influence decisions considerably. Incomplete or 
inadequate information is frequently the main reason for wrong decisions that can 
result in a loss of large amounts of money, labour and time. For rational decision-
making it is therefore important that the information on which managers base 
their decisions meets with the following requirements: 


correctness: information should contain the correct facts


timeliness: information should be received in time


completeness: documents should contain all the information


conciseness: information should be presented in a concise format, such as 
tables and graphs


relevance: information should contain only the necessary facts 


versatility: it should be possible to apply the information to a variety of 
decision-making situations.
In the remainder of this section, we revisit the nature of information, on which all 
management decisions are based. 
The nature of information is problematic, not only for the everyday user of 
information but also for the manager who must use information to make decisions. 
Kroenke refers to information as follows: ‘Information is an odd concept. All of us 
seem to understand what the word information means, yet, when pressed, it is very 
difficult to define the word’. 3 This lack of clarity about what information is or even 
what kind of information may be needed to make management decisions indicates 
that we need to investigate the nature of information in a management context. 

103
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
For this purpose we will focus on the fact that information flows, information is 
intangible, information is a human representation of occurrences, and information 
is valuable. Van Loggerenberg says the following about information: ‘We refer 
to information on a daily basis and in so doing we believe we know what we 
mean by it. It is only when we try to accurately define the term when we find that 
there are various fitting statements’. 4 We now look at four of the most important 
characteristics of information.
6.2.1 Information flows
The office is the entity that receives, processes and distributes information. In 
other words, the office has to ensure that information flows. Information flows 
involuntarily and information will always flow. The office can facilitate the flow 
of information. In other words, the office can ensure that information flows faster 
and is uninterrupted, and the office staff can manipulate the amount, quality and 
contents of information. Certain information can, for example, be withheld and in 
this way the actions of the receiver can be manipulated. A variety of methods can 
be used to facilitate the flow of information, such as the telephone, electronic mail, 
fax machines and computer printouts.
The method that is chosen to distribute information is important, since this may 
influence the way in which information is handled and understood. This will 
have an impact on the message to be conveyed. Loubser says that the dawn of 
the computer age and Internet have made people more sensitive to the variety of 
methods available to distribute information.5
We also have to note that information always flows in cycles. Firstly, this means 
that data is collected, processed, reproduced as information and distributed to 
announce certain occurrences or events. This means that information is futuristic 
in nature. An example of this characteristic of information is the distribution of 
an agenda for a meeting. Secondly, information is also distributed at the time of 
occurrences or events. Think about what happens at a meeting. The whole point 
of having a meeting is to share information and to base decisions regarding future 
actions on the information provided at the meeting. This can be seen as the second 
step in the cyclical flow of information. Thirdly, information is distributed after 
occurrences or events. An example of this would be the minutes of the meeting. 
The minutes or report of a meeting is the last step in the cycle, but at the same 
time also the first step of the new cycle, since future actions will be prompted by 
information in the minutes. Refer to Figure 6.1 for a graphic representation of the 
cyclical flow of information.

6.2.2 Information is intangible
The fact that information cannot be touched contributes to its problematic 
nature. Only the method that we use to distribute information can be touched, 
for example paper, the computer screen, the fax machine or the telephone. 
Because we cannot touch information, it is difficult to determine the extent of its 
influence or effect. It is difficult to determine the exact amount of success achieved 
because information was received in time, or the amount of damage done because 
information was received too late. This is one of the main reasons why people 
sometimes underestimate the value of information in the day-to-day operations 
of the firm. As a result of this attitude, people often neglect the way in which they 
deal with information; they sometimes adopt a careless approach to the timeous 
distribution of information.
6.2.3 Information is a human representation of occurrences
Because information is always a human representation of events, it is possible that 
information can sometimes be somewhat incorrect. Management should take this 
into consideration when reading reports. The information supplied in the report is 
influenced by the frame of reference of the report writer, the corporate culture and 
the objective of the report writer.
6.2.4 Information is valuable
Since 1975, the value of information has increased tremendously. According to 
Neethling, we currently find ourselves in the third big so-called paradigm shift.7 
Neethling’s first paradigm shift was represented by the birth of Christ, the second 
was brought about by Galileo Galilei’s inventions in the sixteenth century, and 
now we find ourselves in the information revolution, or the third paradigm shift.
Modern organisations function in a time when the value of information has 
increased. Evans called the period from approximately 1975 to 2000 the second 
industrial revolution.8 During this time, she says that the manner in which 
information was handled and communicated was totally transformed. 

105
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
Drucker, one of the world’s great management scientists, describes the changes we 
observe as a change in the society in which individuals and firms find themselves, 
and is convinced that the most important resource of the future is knowledge.9 
Drucker continues, ‘Value is now created by “productivity” and “innovation”, both 
applications of knowledge to work’. 10 Knowledge, in other words, is applied to work 
and in this way value is created. Ondari-Okemwa and Minishi-Majanja extend 
this line of thought: ‘The most profound aspect of knowledge management is that 
at the end of the day, an organization’s only sustainable competitive advantage 
lies in what its members know and how to apply that knowledge to achieve the 
organisation’s objectives’. 11 Therefore, the direct link between information and 
knowledge is the potential value that information has for knowledge management 
and the firm’s competitive advantage.
It is clear that one of the objectives of the distribution of information is to enable 
users to apply information in a useful manner. The uninterrupted and fast flow 
of information facilitates the application of information, thereby raising the 
knowledge and skill levels of all staff in the firm.
In addition to the general value of information, there are three specific areas in 
which the potential value of information is high. These are in communication, in 
feedback, and in managerial action and decision making. We will now look at each 
of these.
Communication
Communication conveys information. The information, together with other factors, 
is meant to pull all resources together in a way that works to the organisation’s 
advantage. Communication is what makes information productive.12 This 
means that, when information is communicated, it will activate the receiver of 
the information. While communication is the method of facilitating the flow of 
information, information is the reason for communication. 
Feedback
Feedback describes the status of a task in progress. Receiving feedback is a sign 
that further action can be taken. Schultheis and Sumner are of the opinion that 
information facilitates interaction.13  In other words, when feedback is an important 
part of organisational procedures, interaction will take place between individuals 
and departments; this will lead to the successful integration (working together) 
of the various functions in the firm. Feedback is thus an essential requirement for 
healthy interpersonal and inter-team relationships.

 
106
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
It is important to design effective feedback mechanisms. Feedback mechanisms 
should therefore be designed to integrate the efforts of the functional areas jointly. 
According to Schultheis and Sumner, it is the flow of information that binds the 
different management levels together.14 They are of the opinion that access to 
information empowers staff.15 This contributes to a feeling of being part of the 
larger team, which is transferred to other teams and eventually to the whole firm. 
They also maintain the view that regular feedback has a positive impact on the 
morale of the staff. One can easily understand this because when feedback is 
received as each step of a task is completed, every individual in the team, as well 
as the team itself, has a clear direction of what to do next.
Higher productivity levels impact positively on production costs. Remember, 
feedback is one of the elements in the flow of information that contributes to the 
staff’s ability to react. The more regularly feedback is received, the faster staff can 
react to new information. The higher the added value, the greater the increase in 
the firm’s competitive advantage.
Managerial action and decision-making processes
A manager’s job consists mostly of handling information.16 Management’s role is 
described by Kroenke as consisting of three aspects, namely an interpersonal role, 
an information role and a decision-making role.17
When managers receive information, they act as assimilators or monitors of their 
sections and immediate environment. This role is described as the information 
role. The manager plays an assimilation role when he or she receives information 
and correctly places it into perspective in the relevant context before distributing it 
to the relevant people. To fulfil the role of monitor, the manager will, by means of 
available information, be aware of all activities in their sections and as a result be 
in a position to effectively manage the sections.
To achieve these results it is important to be aware that there is a variety of types of 
information that can be utilised in the firm. The following section discusses these.
6.3 Types of information
In gathering information for decision makers it is not only compliance with 
requirements that is important, but also the type of information needed. The three 
prominent types of information that are used in organisations are:

107
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES


descriptive information: indicates change taking place (for example rising 
interest rates) 


explanatory information: indicates the consequences of occurrences (for example 
less credit being used as a result of the institution of higher interest rates) 


comparative information: for example indicating the comparison between this 
year’s and last year’s profit figures.
Figure 6.1 described the flow of information. The next section looks at the factors 
influencing the flow of information.
6.4 Factors influencing the flow of information
There are quite a number of factors that influence the flow of information, but for 
the purpose of the discussion we highlight the following: structure and culture, 
distribution methods, and people.
6.4.1 Structure and culture of the firm
Bourdreau and Couillard describe organisational culture as consisting of beliefs, 
commitment, organisational form and people know-how.18 Schultheis and Sumner 
are of the view that the communication pattern in the firm is determined by the 
nature of the organisational structure. It is therefore important to pay attention to 
the organisational structure.19
Schultheis and Sumner write as follows: ‘In more traditional organizations, 
information is filtered as it moves upwards through the hierarchy’. 20 By this they 
mean that, as the information is fed higher through the management levels, it 
becomes less and less dense by means of a filtering process. The intention of this 
filtering of information is to provide management only with relevant information in 
order to avoid an information overload. The danger, however, is that management 
can be prevented from having a complete picture of a particular situation because 
of the filtering of information.
6.4.2 Distribution methods
The second factor that can influence the flow of information is the methods used 
to distribute information. Attention has already been given to this factor earlier in 
the chapter.
6.4.3 People
The people in the firm are the key players in facilitating the flow of information. 
Bear in mind that people are not always fully informed; they sometimes keep 
information to themselves; they sometimes do not supply the correct information; 

 
108
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
they tend to supply incomplete information; sometimes they do not react to 
information; they do not always keep documents up to date; and they cannot 
always anticipate the impact of information.
So far we have dealt with the nature of information, the main types of information 
most organisations deal with, as well as the factors influencing the flow of 
information. We now take a closer look at information management. 
6.5 The role of the information manager in a firm
In earlier chapters it was made clear that the information manager is responsible 
for managing the activities in a firm that relate to information. The information 
manager is responsible for combining people, technology, material, money 
and sources of information in such a way that the objectives of the information 
function, as well as of the firm, are achieved.
The information manager can therefore be defined as the person who is responsible 
for managing the information function (ie planning, organising, leading and 
controlling) of all information activities and of the human resources related to 
these activities in a firm. The information manager must create an information 
system that can be used by the firm as a whole.
6.5.1 Objectives of the information manager
The information manager can be classified as a functional manager and therefore 
will form part of middle management. The information manager, like any other 
manager, is responsible for certain key objectives in the organisation. According to 
Quible, the most common objectives are as follows:21


To ensure that the relevant organisational activities are designed to maximise 
individual and unit productivity. One example would be developing a system 
for dealing with mail so that the employees do not waste unnecessary time on 
tedious procedures. By using a good system, the overall productivity of the firm 
can be increased.


To provide effective management of the information of the firm. For example, 
managing all the information that the firm requires to be able to function. In 
other words, determining what information must be provided by whom, when, 
in what format, and to whom; checking whether it has been done; and giving 
the necessary guidance if the worker does not know how to do it.


To maintain reasonable qualitative and quantitative standards. For example, 
the workers know from these standards that it will take them a day to compile 
a specific report according to a specific pro-forma.

109
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES


To provide a satisfactory physical and mental working environment for 
the employees of the firm. For example, ensuring that the employees have 
adequate equipment such as desks, computers, chairs, stationery, and so 
forth, to complete their daily tasks, as well as considering aspects such as office 
layout and air-conditioning.


To help define duties and responsibilities of employees assigned within the 
information office management functional area. For example, giving each 
employee a list of duties or a job description stating the tasks for which they 
are responsible and to whom they must report.


To develop satisfactory lines of communication among employees in the 
information office management department, and between these employees 
and employees in other departments or functions. For example, holding 
regular information sessions during which all staff are informed on general 
matters, and using memorandums or electronic mail so that the employees 
can communicate with one another if necessary.


To help employees maintain a high level of work effectiveness. For example, 
setting objectives for employees, with procedures and standards of how they 
must complete a specific task. Once the task has been completed, the result is 
measured against the set standards.


To enhance the effective supervision of office personnel. For example, 
developing control mechanisms whereby the information manager can control 
or the workers can perform their tasks as they are supposed to.


To ensure the efficient and proper use of specialised office equipment. For 
example, by keeping up to date with the new equipment available and, if 
necessary, introducing the equipment to the organisation.


Ensuring that staff are trained in the use of new and existing equipment.
The primary objective of information management is to present relevant 
information, at the right time, in the right format and at an acceptable cost to 
specific decision makers in a firm. To achieve this objective:


data must be captured according to a specific medium


source documents and data must be stored in the most effective manner


the most appropriate aids for the administration of the information must be 
identified and used


information must be made available to the decision maker through the most 
appropriate medium, for example paper, computer screen, telephone or fax.

 
110
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
6.5.2 Management tasks of the information manager
Within each of the management functions, the information manager also has specific 
job responsibilities. Quible presents some of the more common responsibilities:22
Planning function
This includes:


developing goals and objectives for each of the office functions and services, 
including layout, environment, telecommunications, word processing, 
automation, electronic data processing, records management, forms design, 
photocopies, mail services, and control 


keeping abreast of new developments in the field and determining what 
changes should be made in existing functions and services to maintain a state-
of-the-art position


assessing the need for designing and implementing totally new functions  
and services


developing policies that will help ensure the attainment of goals and objectives.


determining the most effective means of implementing desired changes


developing the unit’s budget


determining personnel requirements


determining space and equipment needs


designing new operating systems.
Organising function
This function in turn includes:


determining the most effective means of organising resources to achieve goals 
and objectives


determining the most effective way for employees to perform specific tasks


designing efficient work methods and procedures


ensuring the maximum utilisation of the firm’s office equipment


developing techniques to maximise organisational and individual productivity.


developing effective methods and techniques when implementing changes


developing effective procedures for evaluating equipment being considered 
for acquisition


ensuring the use of efficient employee selection procedures including 
placement and orientation


providing sufficient growth opportunities and experiences for employees


providing appropriate training experiences


ensuring effective appraisal of employee performance


ensuring the realistic description of employees’ jobs.

111
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
The last five points are mentioned under ‘staffing’ by Quible. Many other authors, 
however, see them as part of organising.
Directing or leading function
This function involves:


using effective techniques to supervise employees


using effective techniques to motivate employees


designing effective lines of communication within the unit


ensuring employee compliance with organisational policies and procedures


ensuring that employee performance meets expectations


helping employees solve work-related problems


using a fair, objective approach for adjusting employees’ salaries.
Controlling function
The controlling function addresses the following:


developing efficient procedures to control the quantity and quality of work 
processes in areas for which the information office manager is responsible


developing efficient procedures for scheduling work


developing efficient procedures for use in readily determining the status of 
unfinished work


maintaining the unit’s budget


ensuring that methods and procedures are cost-effective


motivating employees to be cost-conscious


developing effective assessment procedures to determine why actual results 
fail to conform with anticipated results


developing effective procedures for dealing with employees who fail to comply 
with the organisation’s rules and policies


developing effective strategies for taking corrective action when and where 
necessary.
With the increasing importance of the information function in the firm, the 
information manager will, in future, be more involved in policy decisions at top 
management level. When decisions are to be made about automated systems, the 
information manager will have to increase their knowledge of how new technology 
and systems are designed and how they work. Large organisations such as Sasol, 
SABMiller, Edgars and Gencor usually have a very large information component. 
The demand for information managers in large office-type organisations, such as 
insurance companies and banks, has also increased.

6.6 Perspectives on information management
Information management can be seen as a continuous process consisting of a 
number of aspects, including the planning, organising and control of information, 
as well as the control of the application of information in order to achieve 
organisational aims and objectives. The first three elements – the planning, 
organising and controlling of information – do not function in isolation. They can 
be distinguished, but not separated when executed.

113
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
One view or perspective of information management maintains that we should 
differentiate between the following information functions:


creating or collecting data


processing of data into information


storing data or information


retrieving data or information


distributing information


disposing of or destroying data or information.
It is important to note that, for the purposes of this discussion, ‘the office’ refers to 
the information office of the organisation and plays an important role in terms of 
the above functions, namely:


receiving data and information


documenting or recording data and information


preparing data and information


communicating data and information.
The information manager plays an important role in information management. 
The information manager is responsible for administration and management of 
the information‑related activities of the organisation.
The information manager is also responsible for the combination of people, 
technology, resources, money and sources of information in such a way that the 
firm’s goals are achieved.24 We now look at a number of the more important aspects 
of information management, namely document management, mail management 
and forms management.
6.7 Document management
A document is written evidence that information has been collected and is kept 
for use in the decision-making process. Strict control is therefore essential so 
that documents can be effectively stored, retrieved and maintained. Document 
management is only effective when the document management system is able to 
supply the correct information to the correct person in the shortest possible time, 
and at the lowest possible costs.
Documents can be stored by means of a manual system as well as by means of an 
automated system. About 25% of all paper documents involve correspondence, 
reports and operating papers. The remaining 75% are used to store information 
of a recurring nature that may be used inside and outside the firm, for example 
forms such as purchase orders. With today’s information technology, documents 

 
114
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
are produced with relative ease, quickly, in great numbers and at low costs. 
Photocopiers, duplicating machines, computers and telecommunication 
equipment such as telephones and fax machines, quickly and easily create and 
distribute information by means of documents.
Document management entails the management of the document cycle consisting 
of the following stages:


The creation of documents – Decisions must be taken about the format of a 
document, who will use it and for how long it has to be stored.


Utilisation – Documents are created to be used, so they must be stored in such 
a way that they can be effectively and readily retrieved.


Storage – During the storage stage of the document management cycle, 
decisions regarding the filing methods, equipment and the effective use of 
space are taken. Documents must also be stored in such a way that they can 
be easily used.


Retrieval – The speed with which the documents can be traced is of importance. 
Factors that influence the retrieval speed are storage methods, classification 
methods and filing procedures.


Maintenance – Documents must be maintained, some for long periods of time. 
Decisions must be taken concerning the suitable space and equipment for 
storage while some documents have to be destroyed completely.
In certain firms, the ownership of document management is entrusted to a group 
of individuals. We refer to this as centralised document management. However, 
documents can also be the responsibility of the specialised departments in the 
firm. We refer to this as decentralised document management. In addition to this, 
as information is released from the document management system and used 
by most people in the firm, it is important that the procedures and methods of 
document management are well known.
The tangible format of paper documents facilitates their control. In contrast with 
this, documents in computer systems appear in intangible forms. These intangible 
documents can be produced in unlimited numbers, which has greatly increased 
the responsibility of the information manager to provide adequate document 
management control systems.
We differentiate between two types of document management systems, namely 
manual document management and electronic document management.

115
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
6.7.1 Manual document management
We often refer to manual document management as filing, which consists of the 
following distinguishable elements: the classification of documents, the place 
of filing, filing systems, filing stock, filing equipment, indexing procedures and 
equipment, the filing procedure and filing management.
The classification of documents
The key to effective document management is the classification of documents 
in order of importance for the firm. We distinguish between four classification 
categories.


Essential documents – These documents are the documents that are so 
important to the firm that the firm cannot function without them, for example 
legal documents, tax documents and financial documents. These documents 
are irreplaceable and the firm should see to it that they are guarded against 
theft and fire.


Important documents – These documents are the documents necessary for the 
functioning of the firm, for example personnel documents. The documents are 
replaceable, although it will be difficult, time-consuming and costly.


Useful documents – These documents are necessary for the smooth running of 
all the activities of the firm, for example copies of orders, reports and catalogues. 
These documents are replaceable, but their loss will be inconvenient.


Dispensable documents – These documents contain useful information, but do 
not have a particular advantage to the firm, for example notices of meetings 
and agendas.
The place of filing
When documents are stored in a central place in the organisation, it is referred to 
as centralised filing. Only one person or a small team of people receive training in 
the filing procedures. This option facilitates a high level of maintenance as well as 
tight control of the security of the documents.
Another way of storing documents is to decentralise them. This means all the 
specialised departments store the documents that are applicable to their own 
functions. The firm decides whether to centralise or decentralise the documents. 
It might be the case that a single decision to centralise or decentralise does not 
satisfy the document management needs of the firm.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Filing systems
There are a number of systems that can be used to store documents: 


The alphabetical system – Documents are arranged strictly according to the 
alphabet. The system facilitates the filing of documents according to clients’ 
surnames, geographical areas where business is done or according to subjects. The 
filing of documents according to geographical areas is mostly used in firms that are 
involved in regional collaboration and national and/or international trade.


Documents are filed according to subject when client information is not as 
important. The biggest problem with this system is the allocation of the most 
appropriate subject. The use of a cross-referencing system can be of great help 
with this.


In the case where clients’ surnames are used and two clients have the same 
surname, the initials of the clients will indicate the position of the client’s 
file in the system. The system is widely used and direct access to the files is 
possible. The system is also easy to understand. The biggest disadvantage of 
the system is that the bigger the system, the more difficult it is to maintain. It is 
also difficult to judge the future space needed and it might happen that there 
will be files with the same name.


The duplex-alphabetical system – This system is an outcome of the above and is 
mostly used in large systems. Documents are filed in a more strict alphabetical 
order, namely A-a to A-c; A-d to A-f. An example of this is the surname Aäron to 
Ackermann and Adendorf to Africa.


The numerical system – In this system each document, as it is created, is allocated 
a number. The letters of the alphabet are not taken into consideration. With 
this system it is very important to keep a well-maintained index to facilitate 
retrieval of and access to the documents.


To facilitate expansion in the system, a variation, namely the duplex-numerical 
system, can be installed. This system is mostly found in warehouses. Files are 
stored from the lower to the higher numbers. This system facilitates a higher 
degree of security as files cannot be retrieved and accessed without consulting 
the index.


The alpha-numerical system – This system is a combination of the alphabetical 
and numerical systems. Files are arranged alphabetically, but not strictly so. 
Files are also allocated a number, for example J for the surname Jones together 
with the number 28 – which indicates that Mr Jones is client number 28 with a 
surname starting with the letter J.
Within each system, the documents should always be sorted chronologically. 
This means that documents are stored according to the date of the document, 
with the most recent document at the front.

117
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
Filing stock
In addition to the above important aspects of document management, the correct 
use of the most appropriate filing stock also plays an important role in document 
management. Filing stock includes folders, files, labels, guides, cross-reference 
cards, out-cards and colour coding. We now look at each of these briefly.


Folders and files – Folders and files enable you to keep documents that belong 
together in one place. They also help you to identify documents and to keep 
documents safe. Folders and files come in various sizes and shapes. Standard 
sizes are used for letters and special sizes are used for other types of documents, 
for example computer printouts or town plans. We distinguish between the 
following different types of folders and files: the manila folder, the lever arch 
file, the box file, the concertina file and the ring file.


Labels – Labels are used to name a file or folder. This name is normally the 
name that is used in the indexing system and can be the surname of the client, 
the subject or the number of the file. The information on the label should 
preferably appear in typed format. A number of labelling software packages, 
and dedicated electronic labelling devices are available on the market.


Guides – A guide is any type of card used to divide the contents of a file or folder 
that serves as a marker and also strengthens the folder. The guide can also be 
equipped with a reference code on a label. Guides can be divided into primary 
guides to indicate the main sections of the file or folder and secondary guides 
to indicate the sub-sections of the file or folder. The use of guides facilitates the 
retrieval of information and documents.


Cross-reference cards – Sometimes documents can be filed under more than 
one possible subject. In such a case the document will be put in the most 
suitable file while cross-reference forms are placed into all the other possible 
places. Such cards consist of a description of the document and the name of 
the file in which it can be found.


Out-cards – These can be used in the format of a file, guide or a sheet of paper 
inserted in the place of the document that has been removed. This indicates 
that there is such a file and that it has been removed. The name of the person 
who took the file and the date of removal must be written on this form.


Colour coding – The use of colour coding is a very big cost-saving element in 
filing. Colour coding can be used with practically every system of filing. The 
method is as follows: each number or letter is allocated a colour. Each figure 
from 0–9 has its own colour and each letter of the alphabet has its own colour. 
It will now be easy to see whether a file fits because colour blocks are formed.

 
118
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Filing equipment
The use of the appropriate filing equipment facilitates the protection of files, the 
prevention of theft and also minimises physical strain when retrieving documents. 
If one wants to select filing equipment, the following points should be considered:


The equipment should be adaptable. This means it should be able to be 
changed so that it can adapt to different filing needs of the firm.


The equipment should allow for variety. This means it should be able to 
accommodate a variety of document sizes.


The equipment should be accessible. This means it should assist in minimising 
the costs of information retrieval by being barrier free and physically easy to 
operate.
A variety of filing cabinets are available on the market. The firm should decide 
upon the most appropriate filing system and then acquire the most suitable 
equipment to accommodate the filing system. The five most widely used cabinets 
are as follows:


Vertical filing cabinet – This cabinet consists of a number of drawers where 
documents are stored in an upright position. The disadvantages of this filing 
cabinet are as follows: the inside of the cabinet is clumsy, the cabinet uses a 
substantial amount of floor space, people are inclined to overload the cabinet 
and it is difficult to store a large number of documents. The advantage of this 
filing cabinet is that it appears neat from the outside.


Lateral filing cabinet – This cabinet is very practical when one has to consider 
floor space since the cabinet can reach up to the ceiling. Files are put next to 
each other with the spines of the files displaying the information references.


Horizontal filing cabinet – This cabinet is especially suitable for the storage of 
maps and plans. The cabinet consists of deep drawers in which the material is 
placed on top of each other. The one disadvantage of this cabinet is that it takes 
up floor space and the documents can be damaged easily because of frequent 
handling.


Rotating filing cabinet – This cabinet rotates around a spill and consists of levels 
of different depths with different files in which each level rotates independently 
of the other.


Mobile filing cabinet – This cabinet usually consists of very simple units of 
drawers placed on wheels. The cabinet is ideal for use in open plan offices.
Indexing procedures and equipment
Indexes are used with most filing systems in order to facilitate information retrieval. 
It is very important to maintain the index and the best way to achieve this is to 
add each new document to the index as soon as the document has been created. 

119
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
As soon as documents are destroyed, the document must be removed from the 
index. All changes to the document management system should also be effected 
immediately on the index.
The index can be done separately from the documents or the documents can be 
arranged in such a manner that they are self-indexing, for example a telephone 
directory. Indexing equipment should also assist the information retrieval process. 
There is a variety of indexing equipment.


Vertical card index – This index consists of a number of cards, each one dealing 
with one item of the index. The heading with the reference information where 
the document can be found in the filing system appears on the card. The cards 
are organised vertically in a drawer. The wheel index is a type of vertical card 
index. The cards are organised around a spill in the form of a wheel. The wheel 
index can either be portable, in a cabinet or built into a desk.


Visible card index – This index consists of a range of cards organised so that 
they overlap each other. Only a part of the card is visible. This index is mostly 
found in a book or cabinet.


Book index –This index appears in a special book with indented guide pages 
on which the letters of the alphabet appear, for example a little book with 
telephone numbers.


The alphabetical filing system is self-indexing – This means no index is 
necessary to retrieve documents. Indexes should be used with the numerical 
and alpha-numerical systems.
The filing procedure
Here we use mail as an example of a document that is filed.
Step 1: Identify the type of mail. Mail should be identified as incoming, outgoing 
or internal mail.
Step 2: Inspection. Make sure that the mail is supposed to be filed. The 
correspondence must have been seen by somebody. Look for the initials of  
the addressee, a filing stamp or any sign that indicates that the document is ready 
for filing.
Step 3: Indexing. Select an appropriate name or reference code. Incoming mail 
is normally filed under the name of the firm on the letterhead or the name of the 
sender, if this is important. On outgoing correspondence the name of the addressee 
is important. If the address on the inside of the letter consists of the name of the 
sender and their firm, it is better to use the name of the firm. The only exception is 

 
120
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
that of personal mail sent to a business address. Internal correspondence is filed 
according to the subject or contents of the correspondence. Make sure that you are 
familiar with the contents of the correspondence to select the most appropriate 
subject. If more than one subject is suitable, cross-referencing should be used.
Step 4: Coding. The name, subject, date or any reference code are highlighted. This 
is especially useful when documents need to be replaced after being used.
Step 5: Cross-referencing. The document is filed under the most appropriate 
subject. A cross-reference card is placed in all the other possible files. As mentioned, 
the cross-reference card consists of a description of the document and the name of 
the files where the document can be found.
Step 6: Sorting. Sort all the correspondence into groups according to the filing 
system used.
Step 7: Filing. Place the documents in the appropriate files or folders.
Filing management
It is not only important to know how and when documents need to be filed, it is 
also necessary to know how to manage and control the place of filing. If no control 
is exercised, documents will get lost or fall into the wrong hands. The person 
responsible for the documents should do everything in his/her ability to guard the 
documents. It is always a good policy to grant only authorised personnel access to 
the documents. It is also important to place a restriction on the number of people 
that have access to the documents.
The control of documents entails the control of access to classified material, the 
control of documents storage, the control of information retrieval and the control 
of the destruction of documents. Each of these is now briefly discussed.


The control of access to classified material: Some documents are irreplaceable. 
If these fall into the wrong hands, it can damage the firm. Special precautions 
should therefore be taken to ensure that this does not happen. One method 
to control access to classified material is to keep the filing cabinet locked at 
all times. Alternatively, classified material can be stored at a bank, locked in 
a safe or put on microfilm. In electronic filing, a password can be installed on 
the document. In addition to this, special filing procedures can also be used.

121
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES


The control of documents storage: File documents immediately when dealt 
with. Always file documents chronologically according to the system being 
used. Maintain the index.


The control of information retrieval: Make use of labels and guides. In the case 
of centralised filing, establish a procedure for information retrieval. Make use 
of out-cards once a document has been removed.


The control of the destruction of documents: The physical space to store all 
documents will not always be sufficient. Every firm therefore will have to 
destroy files on a regular basis. In any event, it is necessary to file only essential, 
important and useful documents. Another solution to the space problem is to 
clean out files regularly. Make use of a schedule to do this. When doing this, 
take the type of the documents into consideration, for example catalogues can 
be thrown away if new ones arrive. Essential and important documents should 
be stored permanently and will never be destroyed. The recommended time 
for storing essential and important documents should be determined by each 
firm. To destroy documents safely, use a paper shredder.
The following are the usual time periods for the retention of documents:


one year: all correspondence, for example unsuccessful job applications


five years: salary adjustment schedules, industrial training documents, tax 
receipts, guarantee documents


six years: cancelled cheques and contracts with clients and suppliers


seven years: all manpower documents


ten years: tax receipts sent in by stockbrokers


twelve years: share transactions from listed companies


fifteen years: accounting documents and registers


indeterminable period of time: permanent registration documents, personnel 
documents of senior members of staff.
6.8 Electronic documents management
Electronic documents management is mostly known as electronic filing. 
Nowadays there is a definite shift away from paper documents to using automated 
equipment. This mainly refers to using computers to file documents. Computers 
are more sophisticated and the storage and retrieval of information take place 
faster. The storage of information also takes up less space. When a computer is 
used for the storage of documents, the document as such is not stored, but rather 
the information it contains. The information is stored in the computer on magnetic 
disks by means of electronic impulses. Documents are stored electronically in files 
and folders.

 
122
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
There is an important link between a document, information and knowledge, 
and the management thereof. A document is the holder of information, which 
is an organisational resource and representation of knowledge. Knowledge is a 
combination of contextual information that is created by experiences, interaction 
and learning.25
As far as equipment and time are concerned, an automated electronic filing system 
is expensive to develop. Costs will be recovered at a later stage as a result of savings 
on salaries and a better information system. The maintenance of such a system 
will largely depend on the staff in charge. Their knowledge of and proficiency in 
the use of electronic equipment, devices and systems will play a determining role.
The training of staff in the use of automated equipment, devices and systems 
is essential as special skills are required. Usually, the suppliers of automated 
equipment, devices and systems, such as computers and software packages, 
provide training. Consultants also render training services and advice. Although 
all the above-mentioned people contribute to the training process, it remains the 
task of management to select and place staff in such a manner that the right person 
is appointed in the right position.
6.8.1	 Electronic filing procedures
The electronic filing of folders and files can be done by means of a program such as 
Program Manager or Windows Explorer.
The principle for creating a folder in Windows Explorer is the same as with 
manual filing. This means that a folder contains a group of files that are related 
to one another.
When saving a file in a folder, choose the specific drive, then choose the 
appropriate folder, then save the file.
6.9 Mail management
The firm can use a number of methods to distribute hard copy information, such 
as incoming, internal and outgoing mail. These include: an effective mailroom 
system, messengers, conveyor systems or self-propelled delivery vehicles. To 
distribute electronic information within the firm, use can be made of local area 
networks. To distribute electronic information within and outside of the firm the 
following methods can be used: telecommunication systems such as the telephone, 
fax machines, electronic mail, wide area networks and teleconferencing. We now 
take a closer look at the mailroom activities.

123
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
In larger organisations the mailing department is a specialist area which must 
operate with competence and economy, and all departments concerned with 
correspondence must feed into and out of the mailroom. Total efficiency demands 
that:


the handling of mail must be recognised as being a specialist function


the mailroom must be supplied with suitable equipment and trained staff


costs should be kept as low as possible


mail must be distributed according to a set procedure and promptly


a system should be developed whereby outgoing mail is signed for and made 
available to the mail department at prescribed times


correspondence must be produced efficiently and economically.
6.9.1 Managing the mailroom
A good mailing service ensures the quickest, most economical and most direct flow 
of mail from the sender to the receiver. It reduces delays in completing work and 
creates a positive image with customers. The mailing centre, therefore, enhances 
all business relationships and presents a service to customers. Because of this, the 
mail centre or mailroom and mailing system should be organised and operated 
according to sound management principles.
Mailrooms differ from one organisation to another. The structure and size of 
a mailroom is determined by the amount of postal communication sent and 
received by the firm. In smaller firms one person can generally handle the mail. In 
larger firms you will often find employees who have full-time responsibilities for 
the mail service.
When managing the mailroom and mail system, you will have to look at the 
following issues:


The employees in the mailroom – In organisations with small mail quantities, 
the duties of the mail clerk could be combined with other jobs, such as the filing 
clerk or messenger. The organisations with larger mail quantities will employ 
experienced, full-time employees as well as a supervisor to do the job. The 
supervisor needs to do the manpower planning for the mailroom, develop an 
effective internal mailing system, design the layout of the mailroom, manage 
incoming and outgoing mail, develop schedules, procedures and guidelines 
for all aspects of the mail system and obtaining the necessary equipment.


Develop an effective internal mailing system – Internal mail is a form of 
communication conducted in writing amongst the staff of an organisation. 
It usually consists of statistics, time schedules, notices, different types of 
memorandums, minutes of meetings and reports. When different people 

 
124
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
must see the same document, put it in an internal envelope and write the 
names of those it must go to on it. It will then be sent from one to the other 
by internal mail. You can make use of personal messengers to deliver inter-
office communications. It saves highly paid employees or managers time 
for not having to do it themselves. You can also make use of office conveyor 
systems, which are recommended in cases where large amounts of paper are 
circulated on a continuous basis and such paperwork can be distributed to 
fixed locations. Horizontal and vertical conveyors are available to transport 
papers on the same level and between floors.


Designing the layout of the mailroom – The mailing function is usually 
centralised in a firm. The mailroom should be located near the receiving area 
of the building and be as centrally located as possible. In a mailroom you will 
find three main areas or mail procedures. They are the incoming, sorting and 
outgoing areas or procedures. They are arranged in a straight-line sequence 
that reduces backtracking and delays in processing. A separate desk and chair 
must be provided for the supervisor. Make sure that it is not in the way of the 
movement of the mail. Modular furniture is recommended. This is furniture 
that is flexible. It can be assembled in different ways to meet a specific need 
and, if a need changes, the furniture can be assembled differently to suit that 
need. It permits different arrangements of tables, sorting units and shelving. 
Furniture must be durable to withstand the heavy usage that usually occurs 
here. In Figure 6.2 you can see the layout of a typical mailroom.



The equipment in the mailroom – The most common types of furniture and 
equipment used in the mailroom includes sorting bins and tables, postage 
meters, addressing machines, folding and inserting machines, and a mailing 
scale. If your mail volume is very high, it might be worth looking at some of the 
machines available on the market.


Develop mailroom procedures – In developing procedures, you must cover 
all the phases of the mailing functions. The procedures are divided into 
incoming mail and outgoing mail. All mail received by the organisation is 
incoming mail. It must be passed on to the designated people or departments 
as quickly as possible. Outgoing mail is all the mail leaving the organisation. 
It must be prepared (for example, addressed and put in an envelope) and 
sent to the Post Office. It is good to supply all the staff in the mailroom with 
written procedures regarding the handling of the mail. This can be written up 
in a manual and kept in the mailroom to be used whenever required.

 
126
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
Mail procedures
The procedures for incoming mail are as follows:


Ensure early delivery of mail from the Post Office. Mail arriving at an 
organisation may include a variety of documents, for example letters, 
quotations, orders, advertisements, invoices, enquiries and job applications. 
Mail must be opened, sorted and distributed quickly and accurately.


Sign for registered and delivery items. Enter the details into a special mail 
register recording the date, time, sender, method of delivery and receiver.


Remove all mail that is marked ‘private’ or ‘confidential’ and put it aside. This 
must be taken to the person or section to whom or which it is addressed.


Open the remainder of the envelopes. Remove all the contents from each 
envelope. Attach all enclosures to the back of the letter with a staple or paper 
clip. Date stamp all the mail and unopened envelopes. Some organisations 
require other documentation such as a record of all incoming mail. This can 
be done in a book or file.


Mail containing any form of money must be recorded in a remittances book. 
Use the following columns: date, sender, type of payment, amount and 
signature. The cashier signs the last column on receipt of the money and this 
signature will transfer the responsibility of the remittance to him or her.
The procedures for outgoing mail are as follows:


All items for mail should be securely sealed in appropriate sized envelopes, 
packets or parcels. Understand and apply the postal regulations regarding this 
matter.


If it is the responsibility of the mailroom, check that the enclosures are included, 
the letters are signed, the inside address is the same as on the envelope and the 
envelope is marked ‘confidential’ where applicable.


Fold the letter so that it is creased as few times as possible. Make sure the 
address is visible through the window on the envelope.


If the letter is bulky or addressed to a country overseas, it may need extra 
postage. Contact the Post Office for the cost per kilogram details.


Affix the correct stamps, if this is your responsibility. A franking machine 
can be used where large amounts of mail are sent. This machine prints on an 
envelope, post card or label in coloured ink the value of the stamp, the date 
and the place of posting.


Assemble mail in the appropriate out baskets or collection boxes. Maintain 
a prompt, regularly scheduled pickup service so that mail received in the 
mailroom is dispatched the same day. It is important that all employees know 
the deadlines for pickup each day.

127
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
Automated mail equipment
You will find new equipment on the market that automates the mailing function. 
In small organisations, this type of equipment is often not cost-effective. In 
organisations handling large quantities of mail, however, it will be good to consider 
such equipment.
Conserving mailing costs
As with all functions, the mailroom costs the organisation money and this 
contributes directly to the profit or loss of the organisation. You should consider 
the following in this regard:


Use the correct size envelopes. The larger the envelope, the more the cost. Use 
the envelopes and boxes sold by the Post Office where possible.


Affix the correct amount of postage on each piece of mail.


Keep your mailing lists up to date.


Use light-weight envelopes/packaging if available.


Investigate the use of alternative delivery services.


Make use of email where possible.
6.10 Forms management
A form is a paper document that contains fixed data and provides spaces for 
variable data. Data elements that do not change or are known in advance can 
become part of the standard entries on the form. Only data elements that vary or 
may vary with each transaction need to be filled in. Forms are used to simplify 
and standardise office work and to accumulate, report on, transmit/distribute 
and process information. A form can also be an electronic document saved on the 
computer. Forms are used to simplify and standardise office work and to gather, 
report, transmit and process information. To manage the organisational forms 
effectively, the information manager should have a clear forms management 
policy in place. This will make provision for a forms management system that will 
provide the organisation with forms that are necessary, efficient and generated 
at the lowest printing and processing costs. The following elements should be 
addressed in a forms management policy:


Policies and procedures for the creation, review, production and storage of 
forms must be established.


Personnel who are responsible for the management of forms must be specified.

 
128
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
6.10.1 Forms analysis
Part of any well-established forms management system is the continuous analysis 
of forms to determine whether a form is necessary and, if so, how it should be 
designed to perform its function effectively. This can be done either systematically 
as an assigned project or when the form is due for printing. A forms analysis 
exercise may result in improvements and therefore a cut in costs by eliminating a 
form item or changing to a smaller standard form size.
Forms analysis may reveal the following: that the form is not needed, that the 
form is not cost-effective, that another form can be used or that two or more forms 
can be combined. The analysis should be a group effort involving the analyst 
and all the users of the form. The role of the analyst is to provide direction while 
the users supply the required information and make the necessary suggestions. 
The analyst should have a thorough knowledge of the flow of the form, how the 
form is completed as well as the information that is extracted from the form as it 
moves from one workstation to another. The users of the form consist of all those 
who enter data on the form, who extract information from the form and who are 
involved in filing out the form.
According to Tedesco and Mitchell, the following questions should be asked when 
conducting forms analysis:27


Is the form necessary?


Does everyone who receives a copy need one?


Is every item on the form necessary?


Is the data entry limited to one entry?


Can the form data be converted into computer language quickly, if necessary?


Have the basic principles of design been applied to the form?


Does the form present its message clearly?
Another very important information management function of the information 
manager is to design forms. We now look at some of the aspects of forms design.
6.10.2 Forms design
Forms design is a crucial forms management function and is done manually or by 
computer. The layout of a form accompanies the form specification information 
when the form is ready to be produced. According to Tedesco and Mitchell, there 
are twelve principles to apply when a form is designed.28 These are simplicity, 
zoning, title, number, self‑instruction, logical sequence, sufficient spacing, 
headings, boxes, lines, font style and size, and printing on both sides.

129
CHAPTER 6 THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION AND RELATED ISSUES
Simplicity refers to exactly what the term says – the form should be easy to 
understand and complete. Zoning refers to the allocation of specific and clearly 
indicated sections on the form. The form should have a title, for example Leave 
Application Form. For filing and redesign purposes, the form should have a 
reference number. Where possible, the form should indicate how data entries 
should be made, for example ‘tick the appropriate block’. The entries on the form 
should appear in a logical sequence, for example surname, initials, title, etc. 
Sufficient spacing should be allowed for people to complete the form.
Each sub-section of the form should have its own heading. Boxes and lines will 
facilitate the completion of the form. The font style and size will influence the 
physical attractiveness of the form and lastly, only if applicable, the form should 
be completed on both sides.
A telephone message pad is an example of a form that does not lend itself to be 
completed on both sides, since an individual message will be taken from the pad 
to distribute to the receiver of the message.
6.10.3 The storage and distribution of forms
The storage and distribution of forms are two other important information 
management functions of the information manager. The objective of storing forms is 
to obtain low‑unit cost of volume production and to avoid using excess storage space 
and losing forms through deterioration. Distribution procedures may vary, but in 
many cases the main office of the organisation may maintain the forms supply. The 
offices then supply forms to regional branches or other offices on request.
6.10.4 Forms control
In addition to the storage and distribution of forms, the information manager 
should also control the whole forms management process. Forms control 
procedures should be clearly outlined and understood by employees before any 
attempt is made to implement control mechanisms.
The forms control procedure is as follows:
1.	 Initiate the procedure: Submit in writing a request for the approval of a new form.
2.	 Register and review the form: Enter the request in the Forms Control Catalogue.
3.	 Analyse and design the new form.

 
130
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR IT PROFESSIONALS
4.	 Assign a number and edition date to the form. Record information about the 
reproduced form. After reproduction and distribution, also place the form in 
the Forms Control Catalogue.
5.	 Notify for reordering when stock levels reach a minimum.
6.11 Summary
From the contents of this chapter, we can conclude that information management 
is a very important part of the job of the information manager. If information is 
not properly managed, general management will not be able to perform their task 
efficiently and effectively. The information manager has to see that the creation 
and processing of data, the storage of data and information, the retrieval of data 
and information, and the distribution and disposal of data and information are 
done according to sound principles. In this manner the information manager will 
assist the firm to optimise its profits by cutting information management costs. 
As the nature of information makes it difficult to handle, the necessary systems 
should be put into place to ensure the uninterrupted flow of information.
