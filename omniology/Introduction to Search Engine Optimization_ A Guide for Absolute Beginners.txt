Introduction
Welcome to search engine optimization!
The purpose of this book is to provide a simple, focused introduction to 
search engine optimization, for interns who may be working at a company or 
non-profit organization, for students at a university, or for self-paced learners. 
The approach is the same one taken in most of the books I’ve written, which 
is conversational, friendly, with an attempt at making things fun.
The experiment is to help you get started with search engine optimization in 
a way that is fun and helps strengthen your career at your employer, or help 
you find work through an internship, paid work, volunteer efforts, freelancing, 
or any other type of work. The focus is on skills and approaches that might 
be immediately useful to a business or non-profit organization. I’m not going 
to try to cover everything—just the things that I think are the most helpful.
The other goal is to help you leave intimidation in the dust. I used to be 
intimidated by marketing and now look at me, I’m a marketing strategist, and 
an assistant professor of marketing! But I remember the feeling of intimida-
tion, so part of my approach is to encourage readers who may feel uncertain 
about the field.
The fact is, that search engine optimization has a lot of option—especially in 
the “tools” area—it has grown rapidly, and there is a lot of material out there. 
It can be overwhelming! But it can also be very doable, if you leave intimida-
tion in the dust, by taking incremental steps, trying things out, and building 
confidence.
For example, I had a friend who used to be a journalist and was looking for 
career opportunities. I helped get him started in digital marketing, and one of 
the first things he ran into was feeling overwhelmed by all the options, includ-
ing all the articles about all the options. “There are so many tools out there!” 
he used to say, “How am I ever going to learn all of them?!?”
The answer is that you don’t need to learn all of them. No one can.
The thing to do is focus on some of the tools and skills and build from there.
I encouraged my friend not to worry about trying to learn everything, but 
instead to just learn some basics.

Introduction
xii
The friend worked with Facebook advertising, learned a bit about Twitter, and 
was able to find a local agency that gave him a shot at doing some freelance 
digital marketing work. The career didn’t develop easily for him—he had to 
put effort into it. But a few years later, he’s doing full-time freelance work in 
digital marketing and is writing Google ads. He was able to leave his intimida-
tion in the dust—and I believe he’s also had some fun with it too.
This book is not a collection of individual skills, such as “The Top 10 List of 
Most Effective SEO Techniques” or anything like that. It’s not comprehensive. 
A blog search will reveal that kind of material, which can have its uses.
What I try to do is start a conversation and show you some skills, concepts, 
and topics that have jumped out at me based on my experience. In other 
words, it’s fairly informal and is mainly intended for beginners, especially those 
who might be intimidated by technology. I think my perspective is valid, but I 
don’t claim to know everything, and I learn from third parties and students all 
the time. This especially applies to search engine optimization, which changes 
a lot.
LinkedIn shows digital/online marketing as a top skill to have year after year, 
and search engine marketing is one of the core skills for digital marketing. It’s 
what makes Google and other companies tens of billions of dollars a year.
Each year the way they refer to digital marketing seems to change, but since 
2013, digital marketing (of which analytics is a core part) has been at the top. 
Demand will fluctuate over time, but these are the top skills in any field that 
get people hired.

Introduction
xiii
One of the other points I’ve learned during my career, which I try to reinforce 
in these books and in my classes, is the way that the core areas of digital mar-
keting are related. For example, I consider search engine marketing to be 
tightly connected to all other areas in digital marketing. The central goal of 
digital marketing is to develop content that flows through various channels, 
including search engines.
Just like each of the other areas, search engine marketing is crucial. If you do all 
the other steps, but you don’t advertise, you won’t get as much traffic, and it 
will be that much harder to succeed. On the other hand, as you’ll learn, search 
marketing allows you to track return on investment, unlike almost every other 
kind of traditional advertising (radio, TV, billboards, etc.), and that’s why it is so 
important. You can start out small, look at how much revenue resulted from 
the ads, and build with confidence. Search engine marketing has helped busi-
nesses around the world, both large and small, effectively sell on the Internet.
This book mentions what I call the core areas of digital marketing: Content, 
AdWords, Social, and Analytics (CASA). My goal is to reinforce how all the 
areas are connected. AdWords is Google’s tool for creating ads for search 
engine marketing. The inspiration came from my professional background, as 
well as looking at trends in the marketplace.

Introduction
I make liberal use of Google resources whenever I can, but sometimes it helps 
to curate them a bit. The quality and understandability varies; usually Google 
is technically accurate, but sometimes the results make more sense to an 
engineer, not a beginner.
I’ve come across a few videos that I recommend you watch, before you do 
anything else, and they present things dynamically and interestingly. It will help 
make these ideas concrete. Depending on how you are reading this book, you 
can go on YouTube and search for them there.
#1: How Search Works by Matt Cutts
If you end up pursuing digital marketing, you will probably want to seriously 
consider exploring Google’s YouTube channel and look for blog posts and 
articles by Matt Cutts:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNHR6IQJGZs
#2: What Is AdWords?
Google AdWords is Google’s tool for creating paid advertising. This book is 
about search engine optimization, which is also known as “organic” search, but 
it’s helpful to understand how paid ads and unpaid organic results relate to 
each other, and this gives some context.

#3: Marketing in 60 Seconds: What Are Google Ads?
This is a non-Google video that I made with the help of a “whiteboard 
animator,” who helped me to boil things down.

How Search Works for You
I think it’s helpful to point out that even though the inner workings of search 
can seem complex, when you’re learning, you can always go back to the 
so-called “user experience”. That is, what your own experience of a given tool 
or process is.
Without thinking about it, you are probably regularly engaged in the Google 
ecosystem of search engine optimization and search engine marketing. In fact, 
if you ever type in anything on Google, you’re there.
For example, here is a slightly “older” view of Google, which I think serves 
our purposes:
This is from around 2010, so the search page looks similar but some things have 
changed. If we run this same search today, it would look something like this:

It looks a little more elegant, easier on the eyes, and has more whitespace.
The ads and “organic search results” are delineated a bit differently. In the next 
image, the ads, driven by the Google AdWords platform, are highlighted with 
boxes, and the arrow is pointing at the organic search result.
One way to think of it is kind of like a library, except Google is a for-profit 
library.

Chapter 1 | Introduction
4
If you walk into a typical library, they’ll have all kinds of free guides that list 
resources in your communities. But if they were a for-profit library, they 
sell advertising, and advertisers might compete with each other to get the 
prominent position for their ads. It’s the same thing on Google—there’s a 
space where you compete with other advertisers for paid ads that are driven 
by AdWords (see www.google.com/adwords).
But in a library, there are the free resources, and how are they typically 
organized? Probably neutrally—that is, using some kind of system that allows 
you to find what you’re looking for, such as alphabetically, or some kind of 
searchable system. They might also curate things, such as organize them, or 
feature them, for browsing and exploring.
What Google, or any other search system for that matter, tries to do is guess 
what would be the most relevant result based on what you search for. Then, in 
the paid advertising space, companies compete to get the top spot, and in the 
unpaid, organic search results, Google will also list things based on relevance 
and popularity.
To get technical about it, there are several hundred known and theoretical 
ranking factors, and they affect “position” on Google. They determine how high 
your web site or article will rank on Google—the search engine optimization 
community is constantly trying to figure everything out. Google is public with 
some things and transparent with others.
But in the end, Google tries to keep things relevant and calculate a rank based 
on a variety of factors, including how popular material is. The more people 
who visit a site, the higher it will rank on a particular topic.
Google also takes into account other sites that link to yours, and the “authority” 
of those sites. For example, if you get a news article written about your site, 
media sources often have a lot of authority, because Google basically figures 
that if they cover something (depending on the site), it has a higher chance 
of being newsworthy. Since some legitimate human has made the choice to 
highlight it, Google pays more attention.
It All Comes Down to Quality Content
What I’ve seen in search engine optimization is that it has grown as an 
industry as Google has grown, and in the field of digital marketing, it seems to 
be the most constantly changing area. Best practices mean companies have to 
constantly react to what Google does, where they constantly seek to expand 
and improve how search results appear (and to impact their own profitability).
Naturally, marketing agencies, experts, workshops, and entire conferences and 
publications have arisen to address the area, and a great variety of techniques 
and philosophies and best practices have converged. A great number of people

have also tried to game Google, by trying all kinds of tricks to get higher 
ranking in search results for their web sites and clients.
What I tell my students, and what I find constantly reinforced by the industry 
and by Google itself, is that in the end, it pretty much all comes down to 
quality of the content.
For example, if you did nothing other than write high quality, compelling, 
relevant articles on topics related to your business and organization, Google 
will find them, and more importantly, people will find them. If they’re relevant 
and interesting, meaningful or helpful, more people will share them with other 
people. If this happens, they will climb higher in rankings.
I feel like the 90% figure is fair—if you spend 90% of your time on developing 
quality content (which could include video, of course), that’s the biggest battle 
of search engine optimization. I’ve definitely witnessed efforts to master all the 
supposed “best practices” but which end up short changing the content itself.
Remember what I called the core areas of digital marketing? Content, 
AdWords, Social, and Analytics (CASA). The largest components of the field 
of digital marketing can basically be reduced to these parts—notice that it all 
begins with Content:
You need content to deploy on the social networks and messaging apps 
where people spend increasing amounts of time. For the time being, for the 
foreseeable future, people are using search engines to find information. What 
you want to determine is how did it all perform?
Not the Only Game in Town
This book focuses on Google, google.com in particular, but it’s fair to say that 
it’s not the only game in town. There are other search engines. As people’s 
preferences shift and evolve, there will be other ways people search the 
Internet .

Chapter 1 | Introduction
6
YouTube
For example, YouTube is technically, actually the second most popular search 
engine. People increasingly turn to it, not only for entertainment, but also to 
become more informed. This is especially true for people who prefer to learn 
from video rather than reading an article. Video content is definitely on the rise.
How does search work on YouTube? Similar principles apply.
For example, what follows is a silly music project I did in my past life in rock 
‘n’ roll. The “real” band I was in didn’t have a hit radio single, so I got together 
with some friends and made a joke, but we also made a few videos.
If you type the name of the project—“Gerbil Liberation Front”—into YouTube, 
at least at the moment, the top result is by someone who copied the video 
and uploaded it themselves. The reason it appears at the top is because they 
included the name of the project in the title of the video. (In “conventional” 
search engines, it’s worth remembering that the title of an article is important.)
Whereas the second result (shown with an arrow) is a YouTube channel, so 
it doesn’t rank as high:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization

Then, very recently, the album was added to a site called CD Baby, which 
offers artists the ability to be included in a kind of automatic video that people 
can watch to get exposed to the music, so that shows up third.
All the way in fourth place is the original video upload, simply titled “Chew”. In 
order to increase the rank, I could change the title to Gerbil Liberation Front. 
I could also try to write Google and ask them to remove the unauthorized 
content. Then, just as with any other search engine, I could try to get more 
traffic to the video—for example, by mentioning it in a book.
Bing (not Crosby)
Bing.com is another search engine, not as huge as Google, but still fairly 
popular. Techniques for getting higher-ranked content on Google apply to Bing 
as well, and in the end, it still comes down to quality content.
What’s Next?
Not only does Google constantly evolve, but the entire industry of how people 
get information and media changes. For example, around the time of this 
writing, Apple introduced a new version of its operating system for iPhones, 
which has a feature that allows developers to more easily write “ad blockers”. 
Guess what is the core of Google’s 60 billion dollars a year in revenue? Ads.
If you consider how many people have iPhones out there (bajillions), then 
something like being able to remove ads could have a significant impact on 
Google. At the moment, pundits say various things—some tout doomsday, 
others say that not everyone will even be aware or run the ad blockers. Plus 
some ad blockers distinguish between “unobtrusive” ads like Google’s. (Try 
searching on google.com—it appears really simple—then try visiting a page 
like cnn.com and notice the obtrusive ads.) Then there’s evidence to suggest 
that Google might make deals with some of the ad blockers to let at least 
Google’s ads through.
Apple is not the only game in town—the other half or so of the market for 
mobile phone operating systems is Android, which is a Google project.
But just sayin’—things change.
It wouldn’t shock me if Apple and Google merged, or Google bought Facebook, 
or Google bought Twitter; but there’s still a need for search engines, and I 
don’t think they will go away. The search experience for some people probably 
started in libraries, looking for books on a computer system, or even a pre-
computer card system. And then there is just browsing! Through books, video, 
music. Libraries have evolved and people don’t visit traditional physical libraries 
as much as they used to. The search experience is there, and for most people, 
it begins on Google, YouTube, or Amazon.

Conclusion
Thanks for taking a look at this chapter, where we’ve scratched the surface of 
the nature of search, and considered where it’s been, what it does, and where 
it’s going.
In the next chapter, we’ll take a look at an important toolbox for working with 
search engine optimization. You guessed it—Content!

Skillbox: Content
This chapter takes a look at the relationship between content related to 
search engine optimization, including tools you can use to do it yourself. You 
can think of it as a toolbox of skills, or a skillbox. We’ll take a tour of some 
of the things I’m suggesting that you’ll want to try when working with search 
engine optimization.
In some cases, if you’re working for a company, they will already have systems 
and content, and may even have processes for search engine optimization. 
Still, there might be the occasional need to develop more, outside of the 
regular systems. During the learning phase, it can be helpful to know how to 
do it yourself, so you can get the feel of it or start straight out making “real” 
content as you’re learning.
The goal is to introduce you to some concepts and tools that I think are 
worth trying, including for having material to work with as we learn more 
about search engine optimization through the rest of the book.
Curation vs. Creation vs. Collaboration
The general approach I recommend with content, especially if you’re just 
learning about search engine optimization, is to think about each of these 
areas as connected.
2

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
10
Curation
When you curate content, you go out and find it, and then share, review, 
and comment on it. You might just be gathering and collecting information. 
Even if you don’t feel like you have a creative bone in your body, you can 
certainly go out and find material that might be interesting and relevant to 
your organization and then point to it and comment on it.
For example, in a blog post, you might find a collection of articles on a topic, 
write brief summaries/reviews, provide links to the original articles, and then 
offer some kind of conclusion. Or you might find YouTube videos that relate 
to a particular topic and link to them or embed them in a blog post. Then 
you might post your blog to social media, and thereby generate some traffic 
and awareness. The overall goal is to generate traffic to your site, based on 
providing relevant, compelling content, which will have a positive impact on 
search engine rank.
Creation
This is the best way to go if you can manage it, and can be the most fun. It takes 
more time, but it will probably result in the highest impact on search engine 
optimization. If the content is all you, you are less likely to lead someone to 
another web site. Ideally, you are inviting people to visit you, and not only 
giving them a reason to stay on your site longer than 60 seconds, but giving 
them reasons to come back.
Writing an article, posting to a blog, creating a video—all of these things are fair 
game, and if you go the extra mile to get know your customers and determine 
what they actually are interested in, you can create content tailored to the 
audience. What kind of content you create depends on the organization, but 
ask yourself who the audience is and consider what kinds of things they’d 
be interested in. You can ask people in person, by phone, by e-mail, on social 
media, and so on. It never hurts to test ideas and find out what people are 
interested in by going directly to them in some way.
Even if you aren’t a “media professional,” it can be helpful to develop some 
basic content. You can always ask others to review your efforts, and trying it 
out will help you be in a better position to source it. If you end up having the 
choice, it’s better to focus on what you do best and hire someone to do the 
rest.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
11
Collaboration
I think this one is helpful, especially for freelancers, independent business 
owners, and students. It can be a way to save money, a way to pool resources. 
You find people you can work with. It might be that you find someone who 
is a writer, offer to cowrite some content or do some research, and get the 
benefit of their writing skills or their reputation. If you want to make a video, 
you find people who are interested in the same outcome—raising awareness 
of a particular topic—or people who want to try something new just like 
yourself.
In other words, don’t rule out anything. Even if you don’t feel confident doing 
it yourself, can’t afford to hire anyone, and don’t know where to start, you 
might be able to find people who are looking to collaborate, even if it’s just for 
the learning experience.
In a business sense, it can be the same thing. If a single local business owner 
doesn’t have enough money for a particular project, you might be able to find 
a collection of business owners who want to pool resources for some kind of 
project (such as a video featuring local businesses). Or, using the Internet, you 
can find similar businesses in different areas and develop an article, a video, or 
content that could be repurposed for each business. With slight changes, the 
material could be re-used effectively.
Create a Google Account/Gmail Address
Google has a lot of free tools that make it easier to work with content, and 
when you have a Google account, it’s easier to sign in to all the tools.
As a first step, I recommend creating a free Google account by going to 
http://mail.google.com and clicking Create Account. I advise my students 
in all my classes do this.
Content: Start a Blog (or Find One)
Blogs are an excellent starting places for developing content; they are basically 
specialized web sites for developing and posting articles on any topic you 
choose. A blog is a good example of how some of the core areas of digital 
marketing tie together.
As you saw in the first chapter, one way to think of the relationship of content 
to other areas in digital marketing is as a circle, where you start the whole 
thing with content:

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
12
• 
Content: At a typical company, you might have a web site 
and possibly a blog as platforms for content. The idea is 
to draw people in and then promote the content.
• 
Social/Search: Then you take some of that content, a blog 
post for example, and do several things to promote it. 
You share that article on social media, and you run some 
ads to let people know about it. You’re putting something 
out there, and the idea is to draw people back to your 
site. Google sees it and determines if the content is good 
enough. If so and if people click on it, Google gives you a

Analytics: You can put all the effort into digital marketing 
you want, but if you’re not measuring performance, 
what’s the point? It’s not just for show, it’s to help your 
organization be sustainable. The best way to keep things 
clear is to measure performance, which means paying 
attention to analytics, such as the number of visitors to 
your web site.
If you want to start a blog, there are a variety of platforms for blogging, but 
blogger.com is one of the easiest to use.
My general experience with developing content is that the more complicated 
you get, the less sustainable it is. That is, you might try to use the most 
sophisticated platform, approach or tools, but in some cases that can slow 
you down, when all you really need is good writing and some visuals (or a 
video). I believe in using the simplest platforms possible, to help make it easier 
to actually develop content. Blogging and writing articles is one of those things 
that is easy to set aside or delay. The easier and simpler it is to make and post 
content, I believe the more likely it will be that you do it regularly. Simplicity is 
important. That’s why I recommend Blogger as a starting point, and why I ask 
my students to create a blog as part of every class.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization

If you’re interested in developing content as a skill, my general suggestion is to 
create a blog and set the goal of posting to it at least once a month. Choose 
a topic or tool you’re learning about or a technique you’re interested in, do 
some research, gather some links, and get in the habit of developing some 
ongoing posts. It will help keep your skills current and it will also be something 
you can point to when you’re trying to get clients or find work.
Even if you already have a blog or one that’s been untouched for a while, I still 
suggest creating a new one in Blogger. It’s always helpful to learn new tools. 
Another reason it’s helpful is because you could end up in a situation where a 
client might want to create a blog, and you can help them get started, by being 
familiar with and showing them different tools.
This same principle applies to some of the other tools we’re looking at in 
this chapter. I recommend trying them in some way, both for own education 
but also because the skills could be useful for showing a client (or potential 
employer) someday.
So to get started, visit http://www.blogger.com. Either sign in with your 
Google account or click the Create an Account link at the bottom.

On the Blogger site, click the New Blog button.
For practice, I wouldn’t be too concerned with the title. You can change it 
later easily, and you can also create/delete blogs easily. Feel free to use “Social 
Media Perspective” as a title if you want.
The title is simply what appears visually at the top of the blog. The Address 
field is the opportunity Google gives you to create a custom address. Because 
it’s a free tool, you might have to experiment a bit until you find one that’s 
available. Type your ideas in the Address field and see what happens:
What you’re doing is coming up with the custom portion of the blog’s address.
It turns out that, for this example, the address socialbuzznews.blogspot.com 
is available. The link for this blog is http://socialbuzznews.blogspot.com.
Then, after you choose a title and address, you can choose a template to 
determine the look and feel of the blog, which you can also change later:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
15
After you’ve selected a template (I recommend starting with Simple), click the 
Create Blog! button. Following these simple steps, you’ve created a blog and 
you can start blogging!
Your mission if you choose to accept it is to make a sample post, and then 
share the link on Facebook or via e-mail.
■
■Note  One way to “cheat” if you forget the link for your blog is to click on the View Blog button 
(see the previous screenshot), which will open up the blog in your browser. Then you can copy the 
link from the address field and paste it into Facebook, or an e-mail, etc.

Weekly Bloggery: What I Do in My Classes
In case you picked the book up from Amazon, you might be interested to 
try the exercise that I require my students do in the classes I teach, which is 
simply to blog at least once a week. I often have them blog on specific chapters 
they are reading.
As a way to learn and as build up a habit of blogging, and as a way to impress 
recruiters (blogs do), I invite you to start blogging, on this chapter even, 
and to do so at least once a week. Go into Google Calendar and set up a 
weekly reminder if you need to. Do whatever it takes. It’s a habit that makes 
a difference over time.
Simple suggested guidelines until it becomes a habit is to blog as little as 
2-3 paragraphs and include a visual of some kind. Learn how to take a 
screenshot (I recommend using Snagit) or find a picture on a site like www.
publicdomainpictures.net.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
17
Just start blogging, simply, and describe something you’re learning. To explore 
digital marketing more fully, go on over to social media (Facebook or LinkedIn) 
and share your blog post. Not only will you most likely have people who 
appreciate seeing it, it will also give you more confidence going forward. That’s 
no big thing. You might think, “I’m blogging as part of learning how content 
impacts search engine optimization!”. That sounds impressive, because it is!
Search Drill: Find a Blog
I recommend that you try creating a blog (and even setting a reminder to 
make a post once a month or more!).
I also a good idea to find a blog that you’re interested in reading, as an example 
of “curating” content. You can find them using Google (search for “seo blogs”). 
Find articles that looks interesting and make a note of the links. Then take 
your readers on a tour of some of the blogs that you found helpful.
Content: Create a Free Web Site
Ultimately, when you talk about search engine optimization, you’re talking 
about optimizing a web site. To review, a blog can be a web site on its own 
or it can be part of a larger web site, such as an e-commerce web site where 
you buy products. But in either case, whatever features a web site has (blog, 
e-commerce, etc.), it is primarily the content that results in people visiting, the 
site sending signals to Google, and Google rewarding you with higher search 
engine rankings.
Whether you are optimizing your own web site or working on someone 
else’s, it can be helpful to consider creating an “official” web site for a project, 
event, campaign, or client. I like Blogger because it is simple to use, but it’s 
not really designed to create general web sites. Other blogging platforms, 
such as WordPress (www.wordpress.com—there are free and paid versions), 
have grown to the point where they can serve as fully-functional web sites, 
depending on how you organize them.
If you’re getting confused, just think of a blog as a place you post ongoing 
content, such as a library of articles, and your main site is the reference material 
that may not change as often, whether it’s for a business or organization.
For general use, I think Google Sites is a good tool for anyone creating a 
simple web site, and more tools are mentioned at the end of this chapter. I 
recommend you try making a Google Site and keep it as part of your arsenal. 
You might even want to have a Google Site be your main site, such as your 
freelance business, with basic information.

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
18
To get started, go to http://sites.google.com. Log in if you need to (it’s 
best to use a Gmail address created at mail.google.com) or click the Create 
Account button. (You do this to create a new Google account using your 
existing e-mail address.) You should see something like this:
Like Blogger, Google Sites looks simple, but it packs a lot of power. The other 
advantage of keeping in mind sites like Blogger and Google Sites, is if you’re 
not a developer, you don’t need to have technical skills in order to create web 
sites using these tools. It might be a good alternative to provide the service of 
focusing on the content for the site or marketing, and whip up a site without 
necessarily having to hire a web developer. There are limits, of course, but it 
can also be a starting point. For example, use Google Sites to gather content, 
organize, and prototype, and then, when you have a better idea of where 
things are going, hire a designer/web developer or get costs and let your client 
choose.
I think the same applies to marketing microsites—say you develop a social 
media campaign and you want to have a microsite. A large part of the battle 
is developing the content—gathering it in the first place—and you could start 
with a free tool, take it to the limits, and then decide if you need a more 
flexible or professional looking design.
One other thing I’ll say is that with the rise of mobile devices, the rules of 
design are changing a bit. It’s not that you want to ignore design, it’s just 
that you can’t fit as many visuals on a smaller screen, and the mobile user is 
particularly interested in getting to the information. In other words, going to a 
site that looks okay on mobile devices (i.e., is simpler) is not such a bad idea.
So, back to Google Sites.
It’s that easy. You click the Create button. (Note, in this chapter, we use the 
Classic Sites option; depending on when you read this you may have an option 
for the New Sites).

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
19
If you’re taking it for granted how easy it is, try going to Godaddy.com and 
look at how much effort is required to start a hosting account and get a web 
site started. Whether you’re using a content management system like Drupal, 
which is a website builder or using a manual tool like Dreamweaver, it’s a lot 
of work. I guarantee after trying that, you’ll appreciate how much time you’re 
saving by just being able to click Create. Thanks, Google.

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
20
As with Blogger, there are some prebuilt templates you can choose from. In 
It’s a little bit trickier to go back and change things in Google Sites, so until 
you spend some time really exploring it, I recommend choosing the Blank 
template at first.
You select the template and then choose an address, just like you do in Blogger.
You can click in the Name Your Site field and type in a name, which is like a 
title, and can be changed easily later. Then you have to experiment and try 
different “site location” names. You can also click on Select a Theme, or on 
More Options, but to begin with I suggest keeping it simple. (In Google Sites, 
you can always come back and change the theme later. Themes provide the 
basic look and feel of the site.)

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
21
You also have to type in the CAPTCHA code (such as “bitsu” shown previously) 
before you click the Create button.
As you’re typing in site location names, Google may tell you that the one you 
want isn’t available:

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
22
Keep trying until you find one that’s available. Voila! You have a new web site.
To learn more about Google Sites, go to either of these links, which point to the 
same place: https://support.google.com/sites/?hl=en#topic=1689606 
or http://tinyurl.com/googsite-help.
My recommendation is to begin by making a basic site. It could be for yourself 
or your portfolio, or for a potential client, such as an imaginary local business 
or a promotional campaign of some kind.
■
■Note  There is a “classic” version of Google Sites, and a new one that Google is rolling out. I 
recommend trying the classic version first, until the new one works. Google may give you a choice 
of which to use.
Other Systems for Making Web Sites
A couple more options that are popular and have free/paid options for making 
web site, include:
• 
http://wix.com
• 
http://weebly.com
Take a look and try them out. Even if you’re an intern at a large corporation, 
sometimes big companies use microsites too—especially in marketing 
situations.
Personally, I have been pretty impressed with Weebly.
Make/Edit a Video (or Find One)
It’s true that entire books, or sets of books, could be written about each 
individual section in this chapter, but I’m recommending some simple starting 
points that are helpful for making content. With video, as with blogs and web 
sites, you may end up wanting to hire an agency or professional to do the final 
video. At the same time, individual can do pretty interesting things on their 
own, with something as simple as an iPhone.
There are a variety of ways to make videos, and if you don’t have a video 
camera or iPhone, I recommend getting an older iPhone or an iPod (yes, they 
still make them) for the purpose of filming video. You can get a used iPhone 
fairly cheaply, connect it to WiFi, and upload videos directly. As of this writing, 
even a new iPod is $200, which is not too bad, with no monthly cell phone bill. 

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
23
(It’s also true that a used iPhone could be used for making video and some 
other uses, even over WiFi.) If you’ve always wanted an iPad, there are used 
options there too.
The reason I recommend one of these options for experimenting with video 
is because it’s simple, easy to use, creates high-quality video, and you can 
upload the video directly to YouTube.
Getting familiar with it, including making simple videos (such as interviewing 
someone) and posting them on your blog or web site, can be good 
experiments—all good ways to build skills and your portfolio. In more 
professional environments, even if you’re requesting a budget to hire a 
professional videographer, you might still want to try prototyping your ideas 
with cheaper modes of video.
Keep in mind that some of the most popular videos on YouTube were created 
with really simple equipment—it’s more about the idea than the equipment.
I’m not Apple-biased, it’s just simple, and that’s good for beginners. Point and 
click and you can make simple videos. Then, you’re one click away from being 
able to upload to YouTube:

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
24
Part of the reason I am suggesting this kind of arrangement is to keep the 
technical hassles to a minimum, so you focus on the content. The easier it is, 
the more fun it is, the fewer hassles there are, and the more confidence you 
will build from trying things out. Just a starting point.
By comparison, you can certainly get a digital camera with built-in video 
capability, or any number of dedicated cameras, load video editing software 
on your computer, and then transfer the video to your computer. In fact, I 
encourage you to explore that approach at some point.
But to begin with, I recommend getting a cheap iPhone or iPod or iPad, perhaps 
one that isn’t the latest version. Just make sure it has built-in video.
I’m suggesting you try some videos without even editing or just by using 
YouTube’s built-in editor. Meaning you shoot some short clips on your simple 
mobile device and upload them to YouTube. Then you edit them on YouTube. 
Simple, fairly easy, and lets you focus on the content.
Another option is certainly Android, an alternative to an iPod or iPhone. 
Another option is the Android, an alternative to an iPod or iPhone. My general 
experience is that Apple takes a lot of time to provide a good, simple, fairly 
stable user experience, whereas with the Android platform, it depends on the 
manufacturer. The time you spend on figuring things out may take away from 
having fun. However, to save money, or to avoid Apple specifically, Android 
tablets are certainly a good option.
At the time of this writing, you can get an Android tablet, with the capability 
to shoot video and upload it to YouTube, for about $50 USD.
Editing on YouTube
My recommendation is not to worry too much about the video; just try 
shooting “something,” even if it’s really simple, and then upload it to YouTube.
The YouTube Editor is located at https://www.youtube.com/editor.
Even though you can do some very basic editing on a phone, you don’t 
necessarily need video editing software on your computer. On a Mac you’re 
set for starters, they come with iMovie. Some Windows-based machines 
include basic video editing software as well. The point is that now you can 
upload video to YouTube and edit there. Why would you want to edit? To 
focus things, to pick out clips you want, reassemble them, add some music, 
and so on.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
25
Getting Going on YouTube
If you are new to Google accounts or to YouTube, you might need to set up 
a profile on YouTube:
Then, the YouTube videos you’ve uploaded to your account will appear there, 
and the YouTube Editor allows you to do some basic editing online. I think it’s 
nice, even if there are limits, to be able to try video by shooting on a mobile 
device, uploading directly, and then editing right there online.

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
26
As with the other topics, entire books could be written about on shooting 
and editing video. You may want to look at some, but I also encourage you to 
try an experiment of making a simple short video and not worrying too much 
about technique yet. I think it will give you confidence.
With regards to developing content to help boost search engine rank, it’s 
worth noting that YouTube is the second most popular search engine.
That’s right, YouTube is a search engine—for videos. So you should develop 
video and post it on YouTube, and then actually embed it in your blog posts 
or on your site. (See the front page of www.rgbexchange.org for two 
“embedded” YouTube videos.)
Putting videos on YouTube is also a form of search engine optimization, only 
your goal on YouTube itself is to get as many people to come to a section of 
the site, based on getting ratings, etc. Technically, though, it is still a web site—a 
section of YouTube that you can manage, where you post your videos and put 
other information.
YouTube is also a social network, so it’s part of content development and social 
media marketing. I think video is probably one of the strongest, long-term 
things that will still be around as social networks rise and fall. Getting familiar 
with making a video, even if it is rough or simple or mainly informational, is a 
good thing.
More Reading on Video Editing
Here are some links to explore in order to help you get started. (I invite you 
to consider reading each article, writing a few sentences about it, making that 
one of your blog posts, and then sharing it! You’ll be glad you did).

Adjusting Digital Images
Another area I recommend exploring for the purposes of social media 
marketing is digital images. This can mean something as simple as looking on 
Google for images. Once you find an image you like, you can right-click on it 
and save it to your computer (Windows) or hold Ctrl down and click on the 
image to copy it (Mac). Try some simple image searches and practice with 
those images first. Then explore royalty-free image collections and services 
like clipart.com.
The point is, eventually you’ll probably want to at least try playing with adding 
images to a blog post or web site, and it’s good to know how to work with 
images or pictures for posting to social media. For example, even when 
you have a text-based post, an interesting, related picture can lead to more 
attention.
Even though when you upload images to web sites or blogs, there are often 
built-in “resizing” functions, you still might want to try a tool like www.
picresize.com to crop an image or resize it. (Try looking at the help section.)
In other words, there are online tools you can use, without necessarily having 
to learn a complex image editing program like Photoshop (costly) or Gimp 
(open source at www.gimp.org).

Chapter 2 | Skillbox: Content
28
Taking Screenshots
For grins, and to add some value to your blog posts, I recommend learning 
how to take screenshots, especially students and interns—or anyone for that 
matter. Think of it as a way of taking pictures on the web. For example, most of 
the images in this book are screenshots, where I take a picture of something 
and then discuss it.
One reason you might want to do this is because in a blog, you might want 
to add visuals, and taking a picture of a piece of software, or a web site, is an 
easy way to get a visual.
Greenshot is one free tool you might like to try. You find it at www.
getgreenshot.org.
On the Mac, you can also press Cmd+Shift+4 on your keyboard to capture 
whatever is on the screen. (See http://guides.macrumors.com/Taking_
Screenshots_in_Mac_OS_X for more information.)
Your mission should you choose to accept it is to choose a feature in something 
like Blogger, Google Sites, or even Facebook, explore it, take a screenshot or 
two of it, and put it in a blog post.
I also recommend taking a serious look at Snagit. There’s a free trial, and 
it’s a good way to be able to add arrows and text, easily edit images, take 
screenshots, etc. (it’s what I use for the books I write).
Conclusion
Congratulations on getting your feet wet with what I believe is the true 
foundation of search engine optimization—actually making content. Google is 
always working on updating things, with the goal of making it easier for you to 
focus on what’s most important—the content, as opposed to all the technical 
things that go around it. Blogger and Google Sites are good examples of this. 
They are excellent learning tools for non-profits or small companies that need 
to be frugal. Then there are always the slightly more sophisticated options, 
such as WordPress, Wix, and Weebly—the three Ws!
Try one new product or tool each week, and of course blog about it. Use 
Blogger, Google Sites, Wix, Weebly, or WordPress. Go for it.
Best wishes getting started with content!

SEO Basics
This chapter looks at some SEO basics, including on-page and off-page 
optimization, as well as related concepts and questions you should ask.
SEO: Where’s the Content Going?
First of all, it’s important to ask where the content goes:
• 
Social media
• 
Ad campaigns
Ultimately, that content should be on your web site. The principle of search 
engine optimization is to draw people to your site with good content. Think of 
your web site like real estate. More content means more visitors, which leads 
to more Google notices. More Google notices lead to a higher rank, which 
translates to higher value.
The important point is to start thinking about is how content can be created 
and deployed on your web site. One simple place to start is to provide 
informational content that helps viewers learn about your products, as well as 
generic, related topics. Part of the idea in developing content to boost search 
engine rankings is that you want to understand your customers well enough 
(by talking to them) to understand what they are interested in learning about, 
even if they are not ready to buy.
Some statistics suggest that of the people who visit your web site, only 2% are 
ready to buy or take some kind of action. The other 98% may just be doing 
research, exploring possibilities, and so on. With this in mind, it may be that

the learning content on your site alone is what draws them in. By providing 
information about a relevant topic for them to read, you draw them in. For 
example, a whitepaper, user guide, blog post, etc.
Content SEO
This is probably not an official term, but I’m going to use it any way. What 
we’re talking about in this section is Content SEO.
To simplify even further, here are the basic steps for Content SEO:
	1.	 Add more content
	2.	 Get more visitors
	3.	 Get more Google notices
	4.	 Get a higher rank on Google
	5.	 Web site increases in value
Other search engines follow a similar process—Bing, Yahoo, etc. (Those are 
the main ones, but Google is the overwhelming leader in most of the world. 
In China, Alibaba reigns supreme, and other countries have unique leads in 
certain cases, like Naver in South Korea).
Here is my top secret graphic that summarizes the entire book and field of 
SEO. If you remember a single thing about SEO, remember this:
IMHO means in my high and exalted opinion (okay, I mean in my humble 
opinion).

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
31
Get it? It’s about the content, and only 10% is about technical tweaks. In other 
words, if you just put good quality, relevant content up on your site and never 
do another thing with SEO, that would be something like 90% of the battle. 
Conversely—and this is the important thing—if you spent your time learning 
about and mastering all the latest best practices of technical SEO, such as the 
latest changes in algorithms or fine-grained coding techniques, it might be 
helpful, but if it’s not built on a foundation of content, it’s not going to be very 
impactful. It’ll do some good, but not as much as if you have good content.
Classic SEO: On-Page, Off-Page
Let’s start to get our feet wet with the 10% of SEO that involves technical 
tweaks, what’s called “classic SEO”. It’s the kind of thing that companies and 
organizations see as increasingly valuable, and for good reason. It’s important 
enough that SEO is right up there with SEM (search engine marketing), and 
is a top skill out of any skill that get people hired (based on LinkedIn’s annual 
“top 25 skills that get people hired).
As long as you remember the 90/10 rule—content is the most important 
thing—you’re good.
One good way to understand how it works is to think about what they often 
call an “SEO audit”. So as a new employee at a company that’s never done SEO 
before, or as a team member at an agency that is helping a new customer, you 
might look at several factors as part of an SEO audit:
• 
See: Can Google can “see” your site properly
• 
Here: On-page factors
• 
There: Off-page factors
See: When you post a web site on the Internet, eventually and probably pretty 
quickly, Google will find and scan it. This is also known as crawling. Google 
goes to great lengths every year to improve the automatic way they scan and 
classify the Internet, but you can make it easier, including making sure all of 
your content can be accessed easily. Why make it hard, right?
Here: On-page SEO involves things you can do on your own web site to 
enhance search engine rank and to make sure your web site/page is set up 
correctly. You could also think of this as “on-site” SEO.
There: So called “off-page” SEO are tactics and considerations for thinking 
about how you get traffic from other web sites. One of the classic techniques 
is to think about links—getting links, adjusting links, deciding how the link is 
going to work, and so on.
SEE, HERE, THERE. Okay, that’s it, the book is done. You’ve got it!

Chapter 3 | SEO Basics
32
Just kidding. I tend to oversimplify things a bit. The reason that I highlight that 
content is 90% of the battle is because in some cases the so-called “technical 
tweaks” have gotten out of hand. This includes entire conventions, companies, 
and individual consultants. Some of them have made wild claims about being 
able to guarantee getting a particular search rank, or getting it on the first page 
of search results. In some cases on the shadier side of things, some companies 
would try to play games with Google, and this is something you definitely do 
not want to do. If it sounds too good, whether it’s a “best practice,” or if it’s a 
paid service, you need to understand what techniques a company is using, and 
if they don’t really talk about it, then you could (and should) say, “We don’t 
want any black hat SEO”.
Black hat SEO involves playing games with Google, which can get you banned. 
Sometimes it’s grey hat SEO, and the only way to learn about it is to look at 
it a bit.
Keywords and More Keywords: Can you Ever Have 
Too Many Keywords?
At this point, it is fair to stop and think about keywords for a moment. 
Keywords are at the heart of SEO. If you haven’t watched the video titled, 
“How Search Works” that was mentioned in the last chapter, you should put 
the book down right now and watch it.
An easy way to think about keywords is that people have to type something 
in when they search, right? You could think of a keyword like a fishing pole.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
33
If you type in a keyword or phrase, it’s kind of like using a fishing pole, where 
you throw it out in the water and hopefully catch something. On Google, 
when you type in a keyword, you get search results, not fish.
If you were to use your fishing pole (Google) and type in the phrase “non-
profit stock exchange” you might get something that looks like this:
The important point to remember is that search engine optimization is 
ultimately based on keywords. That is, what are the phrases that people type 
that will lead them to your site?
Examples of common keywords include:
• 
The name of your company or organization
• 
The name of a product
• 
The generic category of your product
If you typed in “RGB Exchange”, you might get something like this. The RGB 
web site comes up as the first search result. Woo-hoo!

Chapter 3 | SEO Basics
34
This is sometimes called a “brand” keyword, and it’s a little easier for such 
keywords to get top rank than others, because there is less competition.
Another common search keyword involves either a generic product name or 
a specific brand name product. Let’s try the generic product type. Say you are 
a safety engineer and have electrical equipment of all kinds. As part of your 
industry’s safety standards, you have what’s called a lockout tagout station, 
which is a system that ensures that the right switches stay turned off when 
you are working on electrical equipment, so that no one gets hurt.
You could try typing “eco-friendly lockout tagout station” in Google, and you 
might end up with something like this:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
35
Note the ads and the organic search results. In this scenario, the Zing Green 
Safety Products site comes up as a search result, based on the keyword “eco-
friendly lockout tagout station”. The rank for the keyword is good; it’s on the 
first page.
To understand the relationship between SEM and SEO, you can see that there 
is an ad at the top that appears when the keyword is typed in. If someone 
clicks on it, the company will pay for that click. For the subsequent search 
results, the “organic” search results, no one pays for the click—technically 
it’s free. Except that companies spend a lot of money to do SEO, which is the 
process of trying to get your search result as high as possible, ideally at the 
top of the first page—for whatever keyword or keywords you are going for.

Chapter 3 | SEO Basics
36
If you find yourself getting confused or intimidated, remember the marvelous 
90/10 rule. Even if you just post content to a web site—quality compelling 
content—you’ve fought 90% of the battle. From that standpoint, you don’t 
even need to think about keywords. Some SEO professionals might balk at 
that claim, but evidence increases every year that Google rewards quality 
content over just about everything.
You could spend time editing an article, for example, based on emphasizing 
particular keywords, but if you try too much of that, it might sound unnatural, 
right? So technically you might have followed a typical practice of pro-actively 
inserting and emphasizing, and even repeating, particular keywords, because 
those keywords are on the “hit list” for the web site. If you do this too much, 
or if it diminishes the underlying quality of the text, you’re just going in circles, 
because the content won’t be as compelling.
What I generally recommend then, for learning about “technical tweaks” and 
as you start to be aware of keywords, is simply to be aware of them, to 
consider investing time in some keyword-level optimization, but definitely 
place a priority on quality content.
In the previous example, a goal of SEO optimization for Zing Safety Products 
might not only be to maintain the first page search rank, but to try to increase 
the rank for that keyword, to get the organic search result as high on the page 
as possible. Why? Because it’s like free advertising, in a way.
Okay, so how do you do it? You could develop some content on the site, 
related to that keyword, such as an introductory article (or blog post) that 
describes it. Make it relevant and helpful enough, and not only will people have 
a better view of your company, but they might also share it with others, and 
so on.
To return to the “game playing with Google,” basically most of that involves 
trying to determine exactly how Google works, and then trying techniques to 
get as high a search result as possible, often using unnatural techniques, like 
taking keyword insertion and going to extremes. An example of this in earlier 
black hat SEO was to include invisible keywords repeated over and over on 
page. They were visible to user, but were visible to Google.
Keyword based SEO, such as optimizing, adding, inserting, and managing, is an 
example of on-page SEO. It’s something you do on your own web site.
Off-page SEO is something like trying to get a different site to link to your 
web site. Along with many other ranking factors, some known, some revealed 
by Google, others only guessed at, “inbound links” to your web site can 
contribute to rankings, but they are not on your site.
Like when using keywords, there is a natural way to do it, and you can get 
unnatural as well.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
37
For example, if you write compelling content, and if it is compelling enough 
that people share it on social media—that is like a link back to your site. It may 
very well produce traffic, and Google notices things like that. It may be that 
a product review web site has an article, along with a link to your site. That’s 
another example of natural off-page SEO; it happens because of the quality 
of your content or product, not because you proactively sought the link. You 
can take one step further and try to find places to review your product or 
site—that’s pretty natural. Another approach might be to get coverage by a 
blogger, news site, etc.—this is also fairly natural.
But if you go too far, such as participate in some kind of “sounds too good to 
be true” link-building scheme, where a company promises you the world for a 
cheap price, eventually Google will penalize you for these black hat practices.
So just go natural, okay?
Example: SEO Steps for a New Web Site or 
Client
To return to a web site SEO audit, there are several things you can look at. I 
simplified it to see, here, and there.
• 
See: Be sure that Google can “see” your site properly
• 
Here: On-page factors
• 
There: Off-page factors
There are a variety of approaches and philosophies about how to analyze a 
web site initially, and because things change fairly regularly at Google, it’s a 
good idea to learn the latest techniques. Sites like Search Engine News and 
Moz are good sources of ongoing information. The latest information can 
make a significant difference, when you get down to the technicalities. Check 
them both out: 
• 
www.searchenginenews.com
• 
www.moz.com
For example moz.com has a good article, entitled “How to Perform the 
World’s Best SEO Audit”. Check it out at:
https://moz.com/blog/how-to-perform-the-worlds-greatest-seo-
audit or http://tinyurl.com/mozaudit

Chapter 3 | SEO Basics
38
I invite you to read it and then to consider what just happened:
	1)	 I searched on Google for articles on SEO audits, and 
theirs showed up toward the top of the list, because of 
how good and relevant it is.
	2)	 I found it relevant and helpful enough to pass along to 
you, my readers.
	3)	 Some of you will click on the link in the electronic version 
of the book and go right to the site; others may type in 
the really long version of the link to the article and go 
to the article. Google will notice this activity, and it will 
protect and strengthen the “SEO rank” for the article.
So voila! It’s a perfect example of content SEO. But read the article and 
see what it has to say. Another article that I like has a simplified series of 
steps to help you understand and learn what kinds of technical tweaks are 
effective during an SEO audit. For example, see First 9 SEO tasks at http://
www.plusyourbusiness.com/first-9-seo-tasks/ or http://tinyurl.
com/9seotasks.
Read what they have to say and then compare the two articles. There are 
some similarities and some differences that might be a result of either different 
philosophies or being written at different points in time.
This might be the second most important point to take away from this 
chapter—regularly review resources like www.searchenginenews.com and 
www.moz.com. The only thing that doesn’t change is the fact that things always 
change. In other words, on a regular basis, Google makes changes to its 
algorithms, which changes the way things rank.
Activity: Meta Description
Before we get too much into what meta means, I have to mention HTML. 
You may have heard the acronym, it stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
It’s like a screenplay language where the code is the director and it tells the 
actors (the browsers) what to do. It’s like a screenplay for a browser, telling 
the browser what to do.
If you’ve never seen HTML before, right-click (in Windows) or hold the Ctrl 
key down and click (on the Mac) on a browser window and choose View 
Source (or View Page Source—depends on your browser). You can then see 
what’s going on behind the scenes. As an example, feel free to do so on the 
www.rgbexchange.org page.

You might see something like this:
Ack!

Chapter 3 | SEO Basics
40
Don’t be alarmed. Even though a lot of the code looks like gobbledygook and 
is not necessarily legible to the human eye, some of it is. For example, with 
the View Source window open, you could press Ctrl+F, to search within that 
window, and type the word “meta”:
Then click the down arrow until you reach something like this, which is what 
we’re searching for:
The underlines in the graphic highlight the “meta tags,” which are part of 
HTML code. These particular tags send Google signals for search engine 
results. In some cases, web platform systems automatically generate these 
tags, guessing what you want the description to be. In the case of this page, 
what is contained in the meta tag affects the search result:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
41
Notice the phrase “promote portfolio-based investment” in the code example 
and notice how that description is what appears under the search result. It’s 
just the meta tag, telling Google what to do.
For technical tweaks, create a free web site at weebly.com and then go into 
the Settings area to look for SEO.
Then, enter some text for a description for your site in the site description 
area.
Without necessarily knowing the HTML code, you’ve done a technical tweak, 
and it has had a direct impact on the technical code. For extra points, publish 
your web site, then use the View Source technique to search for meta. See if 
you can find what you entered as the SEO description, within the meta tag. 
Okay, go!

Keyword 
Research
Keyword research is the first step in SEO and a fundamental best practice. At 
some point it’s a good idea to start thinking about keywords, and it can also 
be a part of an SEO audit.
If you end up in a situation where a company or small business already has SEO 
operations, they might have identified keywords that they are targeting, as part 
of their SEO or search marketing efforts (where they are jumping above organic 
search results and buying ads on Google). Even if there are some insights avail-
able, it can still help to regularly look for new opportunities for keywords that 
you can target with both SEO and SEM (search engine marketing). Understanding 
the relationship among SEO, SEM, and keywords can also help you ask the right 
questions. For example, a company might have a person working on SEM (i.e., 
buying ads on Google and other search engines), and that person might have 
insights on keywords to target, even if they weren’t doing SEO before.
So this chapter takes a closer look at keywords, the way SEO and SEM relate, 
and some of the tools you can use to explore keywords.
Understanding Keywords
If you’re not quite sure yet how keywords work or how they relate to SEO, 
the best way to get familiar with the process is to go to Google and search for 
a product. Let’s use tennis rackets as an example.
4

Chapter 4 | Keyword Research
44
Remember to determine whether a search result is an ad or an organic search 
result.
In this scenario, I typed in tennis rackets, and an ad was displayed for www.
bestreviews.guide. The thing to remember is that the ad appeared because 
the company targeted particular keywords. That means that over time, they 
asked questions like this:
Q: What keywords are people using to get to our site?
A: In some cases you can know this, by using Google 
Analytics on your site (see Introduction to Google Analytics) 
and connecting your site to Google Webmaster Tools. 
In Google Analytics, you look at the keywords that 
people use to get to your site, through Google organic 
searches (meaning not through an ad). This might result 
in keywords that you already knew about, but it might 
also reveal other keywords.
Q: What kinds of keywords are people who might be 
interested in your site using?
A: To me, this is the central question of SEO and SEM, 
whether you are going for organic search results or 
working on choosing keywords for an ad campaign. 
This is where you try to imagine current customers 
or supporters, or potential customers. You try to ima-
gine the kind of person who might be interested in 
what you have to offer, and then target the kind of 
keywords they use.
Keyword Opportunities
Those keywords out there that people are typing in represent an opportunity. 
As you work through the overall process of SEO, you should develop this 
keyword mindset.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
45
For example, let’s say you work for a company that makes drone kits. Then 
imagine that John Doe is interested in building a drone. What kinds of key-
words might he type into Google when he’s doing research?
Try imagining some:
• 
How to build a drone
• 
How do I build a drone?
• 
Drone kits
• 
Best drone kit
These are generic phrases, but John might also search for brand name phrases:
• 
DJI drone kits
• 
3DR drone kits
• 
Erle copter drone kit
He might also search for a very specific type of drone kit or part, such as:
• 
Carbon fiber drone frame
• 
Carbon fiber racing drone frame
Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about drones (I don’t). Just remember 
that keywords can be pretty generic, but you can also get very specific and 
detailed, whether it is a brand name or a specific type of product or item that 
a company offers. The reason this is important is because sometimes develop-
ing keyword research can involve getting more specific, in order to uncover 
keywords for products where there isn’t as much competition.
Search Volume and Competition
Another concept to learn about is search volume. When you’re thinking about 
search volume, you’re simply saying, “how much demand is there for these key-
words?”. This is a good question to ask, because even if you think of keywords 
that relate well to your products, it doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s 
demand for the keywords. In other words, just because it’s a good keyword, 
doesn’t mean that people are actually searching for it as much as you’d like. 
Part of the process of keyword research is checking to see how much search 
volume there is for particular keywords, which we’ll look at.
The other thing to remember, as you learn about keywords, is that there’s com-
petition. This applies whether you are writing ads (using Google AdWords—
see Introduction to Search Engine Marketing and AdWords) or you’re doing search 
engine optimization.

Chapter 4 | Keyword Research
46
When you are running ads, the competition is a bidding environment, where 
you decide how much you are willing to pay for a click on an ad. There is com-
petition around particular keywords. For example, if two drone manufacturers 
want an ad to appear about their company on Google when you type in “rac-
ing drone,” there will be competition for that keyword phrase.
There’s a similar concept at play for SEO, and there is competition for key-
words there as well. If you think about search results and the web sites that 
come up, you can see how everyone would probably like to appear on the first 
page of search results. That’s the best place to be.
For example, at the time of this writing, if you type in “sunflower seeds”, you’ll 
see in the fine print at the top that there are about 6.5 million search results 
on Google, from web sites around the world!
And at the bottom of the first page, you can navigate to more pages of results.
In theory, you could page through 6.5 million pages of search results, but 
you’re probably not going to do that, and the point is that the higher and ear-
lier you appear in the search results, the better. In general, the initial goal is to 
appear somewhere on the first page, or within the first 100 results, and then 
to work on increasing your rank from there.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
47
SEO is the process of maintaining your rank and ideally increasing it. It is fair 
to say that aside from thinking about technical things like using meta descrip-
tions (see Chapter 9) and doing keyword research, that developing content 
and adding it, to strengthen and reinforce keywords, makes sense. Even if you 
didn’t get super specific about how many keywords were in a particular article 
you added, for example, you might still benefit from being aware of keywords, 
and either writing material or working with writers at your company (or free-
lancers) to develop written material that is related to keywords. For example, 
if you are a drone manufacturer that offers drone kits, you could write an 
article on “The Top 10 Considerations for Drone Kits” and write it naturally, 
where the phrase and keywords appear in the article.
The easiest way to think about gaining experience with keywords is to think 
about it as a mindset—as you are working on content or working with people 
who develop content, it can become a conversation to think about keywords 
and how they will boost marketing objectives. There may already naturally 
be content that will be added to a site, but an SEO person will instigate that 
through blog posts, articles, etc.
Doing Basic Keyword Research
We’re going to look at two options for basic keyword research, based on 
a scenario of a sunflower farmer who wants to sell some sunflower seeds. 
Farmer Sally sits down at her computer and has a lot of options, but she likes 
to use a few different tools. One easy one to use is Wordtracker (https://
app.wordtracker.com/).
You get five free searches to start and you get a risk-free seven-day trial of 
each access plan.

Chapter 4 | Keyword Research
48
To give it a shot, try typing in the phase “sunflower seeds” and see what hap-
pens. It will look something like this.
Click on any of the individual “i” icons in the column heads to see more 
information.
In general, what you see is a guess about traffic, in thousands, in the volume 
column, and an estimate of the amount of competition. This tool also provides 
suggestions of other keywords to consider (sunflower seeds nutrition). These 
suggestions are called “long-tail keywords,” and they are basically a little bit 
more specific. That means they could potentially pick up more traffic.
Wordtracker in general is one of those services/sites/tools that is worth 
becoming familiar with as you do keyword research and learn about the 

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
49
process. Aside from trying the tool to identify keyword opportunities, 
Wordtracker also has some good learning materials:

The screenshot only shows two items, but there are several areas that are 
worth looking into:
The Learn SEO category has some good lessons:

AdWords Keyword Planner
Google AdWords keyword planner is a common tool for keyword research 
and it highlights the connection between SEM (AdWords—search engine 
marketing) and SEO. In order to use it for SEO, you need to start an AdWords 
account. The easiest way to do that is to have a Gmail address, but if you like, 
you can use a non-gmail address to establish a Google account.
To start an account, go to www.google.com and start the process.
At some point in the process, in order to “initiate” the account, you will 
need to enter billing information. I say go ahead and try making an ad cam-
paign using the wizard that they offer as part of account startup, just for the 
experience. (Maybe consider my book, Introduction to Search Engine Marketing 
and AdWords for more information.) AdWords is outside of the scope of this 
book, so if you don’t want to try running an ad, make sure that you click on 
the Campaigns link at the top of the screen:
Then click on the green button to pause your campaign:

It should look like this:
By jumping through those hoops, you’ll have an active AdWords account, and 
you’ll be able to use the integrated Keyword Planner tool.

Before you start using it, I recommend exploring some of the articles that 
appear on the screen:
To try it, click on “Get search volume data and trends”:

The search volume window has a variety of options. In general, I suggest going 
with the defaults as you learn the program.
Try entering a keyword:
Then click the Get Search Volume button:

Chapter 4 | Keyword Research
54
You should see something like this:
There’s a lot of interesting information, but the main purpose is to get a gen-
eral idea of how much search volume there is. In the earlier search window, 
the “targeting” was to “all locations,” meaning the entire world, so narrowing 
that down when you do a search is a good idea unless your web site is target-
ing the entire world.
You can also see the relative amount of competition, which is important to be 
aware of for SEM and SEO purposes.
At the top, you can enter new words or modify an existing search (to change 
the targeting):
With that, you have entered the sophisticated world of keyword research 
using a core tool, the AdWords Keyword Planner! Congratulations!

Activity: Research Keywords
Pretend you own a T-shirt business and are looking to generate ads on Google 
and work on search engine optimization.
Think of five keywords to start with and use AdWords Keyword Planner to 
research them. Then, either think of five more keywords or use Wordtracker. 
Type one of the first five keywords and see what Wordtracker suggests. 
Register for the free trial if you have to.
You can also just start typing in keywords in Google and see what “auto-
suggest” comes up with:
Make a Keyword Target List
As part of the activity, make a keyword target list that includes search volume 
and amount of competition.
Make a Keyword/Topic List
Take a look at your list of keywords and then generate ideas for titles and 
topics of blog posts or articles you could write that relate to each keyword. 
Think about how you could place a keyword into the title of the article, as well 
as into the text of the article at least once.

Chapter 4 | Keyword Research
56
This exercise represents the intersection of SEO and content development, 
where you’re going beyond just developing content and you’re thinking about 
how keywords and content relate. In this case, you’re starting with keywords 
and developing keyword-driven content.
To take this exercise one step further, try reviewing the articles from the last 
chapter about some of the steps you can take to do an SEO audit. Try some 
of the related tools and pretend that you were helping a new t-shirt business 
that has a web site but hasn’t done SEO before. Make a list of the things they 
need to set in motion. Check out these articles:

audit or http://tinyurl.com/mozaudit
and
http://www.plusyourbusiness.com/first-9-seo-tasks/ or http://
tinyurl.com/9seotasks
Don’t worry about doing all the steps; just make a rough plan of the kinds of 
things you need to do, including the tools you plan to use.
The list probably would/should include using webmaster tools, which we look 
at in Chapter 7, so don’t worry about that too much. Just take a look at things 
at a high level for now.
Have fun!

Conclusion
Congratulations on exploring the “10% of SEO” outside of content! In the 
world of technical tweaks, the larger the company is, the more revenue is 
at stake, and the larger the effort that companies generally make with SEO. 
There’s no one rule about how to do it or what kind of resources to allocate, 
but it’s fair to say that as a top skill to get people hired, a full-time SEO person 
might spend most of their time doing the technical tweaks and measuring per-
formance. The technical side is definitely important, but it’s easy to get carried 
away and lose sight of the equally or more important fundamental need for 
good content.
If you find yourself apply for a full-time SEO position, you’ll want to see if it 
involves content development. If it doesn’t, you’ll probably want to ask them 
why in an interview and see if the digital marketing team uses copywriters to 
develop content to boost SEO results. If they don’t, you might suggest that 
they consider it at some point.
In a “multiple hats” role or if you are doing SEO yourself, find some way to 
make sure you are prioritizing and developing content alongside the technical 
things you do. The technical tweaks are only part of the picture.

Try SEO
In order to get some practice with SEO principles, this chapter uses a few 
simple, live examples, starting with Blogger and moving on to Google Sites. If 
you haven’t already, read Chapter 2 first. You’ll learn more from this chapter 
if you create a blog at blogger.com and a super simple web site at http://
sites.google.com.
For the content of your blog post, I recommend writing a simple blog post 
that contains 2-3 paragraphs and an image, on any topic you’ve learned about 
so far. You can then use that blog post as an example for these activities.
If you want, you can copy the information from my example blog at http://
toddsmarketingblog.blogspot.com.
Simple SEO: Blog Post
As you learn more about SEO, you’ll start to think of things you can do when 
you work on a site for the first time, such as:
• 
Determine if it is configured for search
• 
Adjust the meta description for the site
• 
Adjust the meta description for individual pages/posts
Additional things you can try include:
• 
Integrate keywords into blog post title
• 
Integrate keywords into blog post text
• 
Integrate keyword(s) into alt text for images

Chapter 5 | Try SEO

These latter options include going beyond “natural” content writing and 
thinking about how you can “insert” keywords. There’s nothing necessarily 
wrong with that approach, just don’t go too far. In many cases, you might not 
even need to change the title of a page or an article, because if it is named after 
the topic it covers, chances are it has a relevant keyword in the title already.

into Blogger.

Site-Level SEO: Google Sites
Depending on what platform you use, adjusting HTML tags for SEO may be 
very easy, or it might require some technical assistance or research. In this 
chapter, we’re looking at very simple examples, and there are limitations to the 
platforms, but you can get the basic idea.
Google Sites is not that different from Blogger, but it’s designed more around 
creating a conventional web site with informational sections, as opposed to a 
diary or journal format (i.e., a blog.) The difference blurs, but it’s good to see 
how things might be different using a different system, and as you’ll see, you 
should always be prepared for the unexpected. (Hold on to your hats!)
We’re going to adjust the title tags on Google Sites (by setting page titles). If you 
haven’t yet create a Google site, please do so, at http://sites.google.com.
■
■Note  In this chapter we use the New Sites option. Depending on when you read this, you may 
have an option for Classic or New Sites, or only be able to choose the new approach.

You’ll end up with an interface that looks something like this:
Click on Untitled Site and replace it with something like “Pet Store”:
Click Publish:
This is where you choose the web address. You don’t need to do this every 
time. You’ll have to experiment until you find something that isn’t taken.

Chapter 5 | Try SEO
66
You can include numbers, use your name and so on, and when you find some-
thing available, a little checkmark will appear.
Next, click the Publish button and then the View link that appears at the 
bottom:
Your quickie-doo site should look something like this:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
67
Next, on the right (back in the editor, maybe under the original browser tab), 
click on Pages:
You should see something like this, where you can add pages.
Try adding some new pages. Your chosen title should be reflected in the 
<title> HTML tag. If your planning process included SEO when you were 
creating a new page or new web site, you may have thought about what to 
name the pages, such as Dogs or Dogs for Sale. (People are more likely to type 
in “dogs for sale” than just “dogs” if they are looking to buy a dog).

Chapter 5 | Try SEO
68
Activity: Site Title Optimization
In this section, we’re going to try something, but it might not work. With some 
systems you might not be able to update the <title> HTML tag when you 
rename a page. Say you created a page called “Dogs” but you want to update 
it to “Dogs for Sale”. You might be able to rename the page without having to 
edit the HTML. It’s worth trying.
Scenario: Imagine you are providing a specific product or service and thinking 
about how the titles of the pages about the products or services can include 
keywords. For example, try t-shirts or a pet store.
Try making 1-3 pages based on your chosen product/service/keyword. For 
example, create a home page, a page about cats, and a page about dogs.
Now, when you try publishing it, view the site.
Select the desired page:
Then view the code. In Windows, right-click and on the Mac, Ctrl+click. Then 
choose View Source (or View Page Source):

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
69
Then press Ctrl+F to activate the “Find Text on Page” function. Scroll down 
until you see something like this:
Oh no! It’s HTML code!
Don’t be alarmed!
Take a closer look for something like this:
What you see is that the title of the page is reflected in the HTML code. 
Sometimes it makes sense to emphasize keywords in the page titles. Sometimes 
it makes sense to learn about the 200 other or so SEO ranking factors.
Oh no! 200 ranking factors!

Chapter 5 | Try SEO
70
The good news is that you don’t need to learn all of these factors. Remember 
how content is 90% of the battle? Don’t worry about these keywords so much. 
Instead, start looking at industry resources like www.searchenginenews.com 
and www.moz.com to keep an eye out for important changes to the way Google 
crawls for keywords.
Because sometimes things change.
Okay, back to the dogs.
I could use my web platform to change the title of a page:
And then publish and view the page:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
71
I might even expect that when I view the source code:
The <title> HTML tag will be updated, right?
Well, let’s take a look and see.
For you, it might work. At the time of this writing, Google Sites, both New 
and Classic, do not appear to update the <title> tags when you change the 
page title. Doh! Google may update this feature by the time you read this, or 
they may have a great reason for not including that feature. (Although I can’t 
think of one).
The moral of the story is, you’ve been getting a free ride in this book, in terms 
of the simplicity of the platforms, but at some point you might need to dig a 
bit into technical things, and I recommend learning more about HTML. (See 
www.casamarketing.org, look for content and SEO, and then look for SEO 
and HTML).
Activity: Learn HTML the Easy Way
Here’s a little bonus—a secret way to learn some HTML.
If you go back into Blogger and open a post, you can do something like type in 
a word, like the word “bold,” for example.

Chapter 5 | Try SEO
72
If you published the post, Blogger would use HTML code to make your page 
look something like this:
If you are hardcore, you can use your Jedi powers to look at the HTML and 
find an occurrence of “bold” like this one, with no tags around it.
To view the HTML, you can edit your post and click on the HTML tab:
Okay, I don’t see any code here, but that’s because it’s just plain text.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
73
Back into compose:
Now select the text and click B to make it bold:
Click on the HTML tab again:
What’s that? I see some little tags. It’s the <b> tag, which codes for bold. 
There’s also an ending tag, </b>, which tells the browser to stop applying bold 
to the word or phrase.

Chapter 5 | Try SEO
74
So what you can do, using this “secret” way to learn HTML, is go back and 
forth between Compose and HTML and try different things, like formatting 
the text, adding a link, making the text centered, larger, smaller, a different 
color. Try inserting images other kinds of things. Each time you make a small 
change, switch over to the HTML tab to see what’s going on. It’s probably 
more fun than reading the articles I suggested earlier. Go ahead and do this 
fun part first, and experience the power of the secret way to learn HTML.

the times!

Analyze How 
Things Are 
Going
This chapter looks at some of the ways you can measure the performance of 
your SEO efforts. It’s good to do, whether you are working on your own site, 
to justify the time and effort spent, as well as to measure the ROI if you are 
paying someone, or if they are paying you!
Ultimately the ideal spot to reach is the first page of search results for a given 
keyword, and the top spot. Often SEO “rank” programs will only measure 
“down” to the 100th search result. At the beginning, if you’re a new or small 
web site, it may be some time before you can crack the top 100 search results 
for a keyword, but it is still worth trying, and regardless of the exact rank, it’s 
absolutely true that adding relevant, quality content to your site will make it 
stronger no matter what, regardless of the rank on Google, for the people 
who do visit it.
There are different philosophies about what kind of effort to put into SEO 
versus SEM, and there’s no one correct answer for everyone. SEO is likely to 
be an important skill and a good source of income for quite some time, and it 
stands to reason that if you focus your SEO efforts around developing quality 
6

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
76
content, it’s unquestionably a good investment, even if you don’t get the exact 
rank you want. It’s worth saying that there are those who recommend making 
sure your SEM efforts are off and running first, where you can jump to the top 
of page 1 with the right bid, for example. But even SEM efforts are affected 
by quality content—when you deploy content for SEO, it can also boost SEM 
efforts, through a metric called your quality score. (See my book, Introduction 
to Search Engine Marketing and AdWords, for more information.
But in the end, is SEO worth it? Absolutely. Make sure to learn how to measure 
the performance.
Fun with SEO: Check Your SEO Rank!
One way to measure and monitor the performance of SEO efforts is to look 
at the rank of your web site for particular keywords. There are a number of 
tools available—some free, some free trial and then pay, and so on. Here’s one 
to try:
SEO Centro: http://www.seocentro.com/tools/search-engines/keyword-
position.html or http://tinyurl.com/seocentrokp.
You can enter any web site, but if you like you can follow along in the example:
You enter a keyword and type in the web site’s name. It checks what is going on.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
77
If a web site ranks in the top 100 for a given keyword, it will show the rank. In 
that case, your strategy might be one of the following:
• 
Maintain the rank: There is competition for online 
keywords, and it will continue to increase as the Internet 
grows and the world becomes smaller. Maintaining 
existing rank is a good goal.
• 
Increase the rank: This might involve a strategy of doing 
some of the technical tweaks to make sure all the 
appropriate basics are done, and then work on developing 
and expanding keyword targets, in partnership with any 
search engine marketing efforts. You try to increase the 
rank through consistent deployment of quality content, 
over time. Not just content, mind you, but quality 
content, based on finding out and even testing what your 
customers actually are interested in.
Here is an article with some relatively recent free/free-trial SEO checkers, 
which is worth checking out. It’s called Shout Me Loud: https://www.
shoutmeloud.com/5-excellent-websites-to-check-keyword-ranking-
in-google.html or http://tinyurl.com/sml-seo.
Among other tools it talks about SEM Rush, which is a pretty standard SEO 
tool that ties into SEM. There is a free 14-day trial and it’s probably a good 
investment. Compare the free trial/paid tools to any “entirely free” tool, and 
you will get what you pay for.

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
78
Fun with SEO: Hunt for Duplicate Content!
Duplicate content is a large no no. You never want to have multiple pages 
on your site with exactly the same content, unless it’s unavoidable (as it 
might be on some larger e-commerce sites). The strength of content is in its 
uniqueness. It is an important thing to watch for, as is fairly common (pages 
copied, forgotten, material paraphrased, pages migrated from one place to 
another, redundancy—you name it! It happens). It’s common enough to be a 
part of a good SEO audit.
Hunting for duplicate content can be fun and rewarding and it’s also “low 
hanging fruit” as part of an SEO audit. It also gives you more time to increase 
your SEO rank.
Siteliner.com is a good tool for scanning for duplicate content.
Give it a shot. Pick your nearest university and see what happens.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
79
It will look for duplicate content on your site and give you a way to look back 
and see if it is redundant or necessary. The reason duplicate content is a big 
deal is because Google can punish you for having it if it thinks you’re using it 
as a way to get higher rankings nefariously. Also, good content is worth it, in 
it’s own right.
Reporting can include potential redundant content and part of the SEO 
process would be taking content away. Wacky, right? Here you are wanting to 
add content and there you are taking it away. But not all content is created 
equal, especially if it is duplicated or “cloned,” as it were.
Some people like clones I, suppose. But not Google, at least when it comes to 
content clones.
Other Analysis: Analytics
Okay, in the end, “rank” is one of the main things to monitor, but not the only 
one. You saw how an SEO audit can reveal duplicate content; that’s another 
thing to monitor, periodically even, especially if you are at a larger company. 
Eventually, sooner or later, you will want to get into analytics.
I understand if you have any feeling of intimidation about analytics. Case in 
point, once upon a time, the author of this book was in a band, and that band 
was on tour and rode around the country in a fancy bus.
But what happened to that bus? Well, we didn’t have a hit radio single, and I 
landed in a cubicle at an Internet startup company, like a fish out of water. If 
you’d asked me whether I had an interest in analytics, or Excel, or numbers 
of any kind, or even marketing, I would have laughed out loud. (What, me? I’m 
a creative person.) But being a creative person doesn’t always pay the bills. 
I continue to at least try to be creative, and that’s one of the reasons I like 
inserting silly pictures into the books I write.

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
80
Over time, as I experienced the phenomena known as being laid off, I realized 
that there are parts of companies and things they do that make money, and 
then there are things that cost money. Marketing, if it’s done well, is one of 
those things that helps make money, and I gravitated toward it. I also realized 
that even creative people can gradually get more comfy with things like Excel, 
and numbers, and analytics. In other words, learning numbers and analytics is 
a good idea even if you’re not an accountant.
Analytics can give you superpowers!
(Image designed by Freepik.com.)
With these superpowers, you can:
• 
Help a business not waste money
• 
Help a business decide what to invest in
• 
Help a business make money
• 
Keep your job
• 
Keep a client happy
• 
Expand your career
• 
Have interesting things to say in meetings
• 
Sound like you know what you are talking about
• 
Know what you are talking about

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
81
And many more.
So, who wouldn’t want to do that, right? If you remember, analytics is a core 
area in digital marketing.
It’s worth taking time to learn these things outside of SEO. There are many 
free resources out there, including a Google Analytics Certification and free 
study material from Google. (And there’s my Introduction to Google Analytics 
book too).
For SEO, it’s good to note that Google Analytics can provide a foundation 
for giving insights about some parts of SEO. When it is set up correctly and 
connected to Webmaster Tools (now called Search Console), it can provide 
you with fairly detailed information right from your own site that can monitor 
the way individual keywords perform.
Before you try it, though, we will discuss the Holy Grail.
The original Holy Grail was a cup made out of Gold. But the next best thing 
to the original grail is to be able to measure how much gold you get back, 
when you invest your gold. Another name for tracking your gold is conversion 
tracking.

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
82
Fun with Conversion Tracking in SEO
This book is supposed to be an introduction, but this whole conversion 
about tracking holy grail thing is important enough to at least mention. It’s so 
important that it could:
• 
Get you a job
• 
Help you keep your job
• 
Help other people keep their jobs
• 
Help everyone get a bonus
• 
Help people get a holiday bonus
• 
Make all your dreams come true
Conversion tracking essentially allows you to answer a manager or client 
when they say, “Okay, so we spent a lot of money. How much money did we 
make?”
Let’s say you’re at a company called Round Table that offers specialized prod-
ucts for Arthurian knights.
King Arthur comes along for the Monday marketing meeting and asks about 
the ROI.
King Arthur: “Okay, how did we do with radio advertising this week?”
Lancelot: “Well, we had a lot of impressions.”
King Arthur: “Okay, but how many people purchased our knightly 
protection service based on radio ads?”

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
83
Lancelot: “Um . . . . . . .”
Let’s consider another knight, named Gawain.
King Arthur: “Okay, how did we do with pay per click advertising on Ye 
Google?”
Gawain: “King Arthur, because of our goodly conversion tracking, we were 
able to ascertain that two townsfolk of good repute did indeed buy our 
knightly protection services.”
King Arthur: “And how much did we pay Ye Google?”
Gawain: “King Arthur, we did pay Ye Google a fee of 10 gold pieces for the 
magic clicks on our advertisements in the town, and we generated 100 
gold pieces in return.”
King Arthur: “I like this conversion tracking. Why aren’t all the knights of 
the realm doing this?”
Lancelot, grumpily: “King Arthur, it takes effort. I’d rather be off riding and 
rescuing than doing configuration on conversion tracking.”
King Arthur: “Ah well, the royal treasury is not what it used to be, what 
with Saxon rampages and other unexpected events. Going forward, all 
knights shall use conversion tracking.”
Knights: ::groaning and grumbling::
King Arthur: “Yes yes, but I’ve decided that it will be our new Holy Grail!”
Knights: ::applause::
So the moral of the story is that conversion tracking is important.
All this to say that it does require some effort, whether with SEM or SEO. 
We’re not going to dive into that in this introductory book, but it’s important 
enough to mention, emphasize, and consider.
With SEM, in a nutshell, you can set up conversion tracking, and if you’re 
selling something it typically means putting a piece of code on an order 
confirmation, and it beams a little signal to Google saying that a sale has been 
made. When all the pieces are put together, you can actually track how much 
revenue is generated from an individual advertisement or keyword. This is 
a tremendous thing, and it’s one of the reasons Google is one of the most 
profitable companies on the planet—because they figured out how to do 
trackable advertising.

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
84
With SEO, it’s similar. With some effort, with accounts linked and code in the 
right place, using perhaps SEM/AdWords, you can measure your ranking on 
SEO. You can also:
measure how much money is made by organic 
keywords
Yeah, sorry, that’s quite a mouthful. But it’s a good thing to chew on.
What it means is that with conversion tracking set up, you will be able to see 
how much revenue resulted from:
• 
People searching for something on Google with a specific 
keyword
• 
People seeing your organic search result (as a result of 
your SEO effort)
• 
People buying a product based on that keyword
To repeat, you will be able to see how much money resulted from SEO efforts. 
Exactly. It’s a really good, strong thing to do. Not only can it help win more 
attention, more serious attention, or attention at all from a client, manager, 
etc.—but it also results in more investment. It results in more scrutiny, but it 
gives you a strong leg to stand on.
In other words, when clients or managers don’t really understand SEO, and do 
it on faith because someone said they should, or because they read an article 
about it, they may be willing to invest in it, but still don’t take it seriously. If 
the budget is reduced for any reason, and the heat is on, then that line item 
expense (or job) could be on the line. How much better, then, to flip the 
tables, measure things out, and work toward proactively gaining scrutiny, by 
demonstrating how organic SEO can actually make money.
It’s also a very real possibility that consistent, longstanding efforts at SEO 
could generate revenue and profit. Even if it doesn’t start out that way, even if 
it is a long-term investment to increase rank or customer appreciation of the 
quality content on a site—even if it’s a while before you can actually prove a 
sale is coming through organic keywords—it is absolutely worth exploring.
Conversion tracking can make that happen. Google “conversion tracking 
adwords” or “conversion tracking of SEO in Google Analytics” and things like 
that. It requires some hoops, it’s outside of the scope of this book, but I’ve had 
my say, and I’ll leave it at that.
Just remember that it is the Holy Grail. Consider blogging about the Holy 
Grail.

Set Up Google Analytics: Blogger, Google Sites
So let us return to simpler things in this introductory book. Google Analytics 
is very easy to set up in Blogger and Google Sites, so I invite you to do so, in 
order to get more familiar with it. We’ll look at one of the basic SEO-related 
reports you can run without having to set up conversion tracking.
Setting Up a Google Analytics Account
Follow these steps to set up your Google analytics account.
	1.	 Go to http://google.com/analytics and sign in and/
or set up an account.
If it’s the first time you’re using it, Google may guide 
you through a wizard to set up a web site. Enter 
your blog address for the web site, such as http://
toddsmarketingblog.blogspot.com.
	2.	 There’s more than one way to add a web site to Google 
Analytics. If you’ve used it before, you can access the 
Admin menu:

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
86
Then select the Account drop-down menu:
And click Create New Account:
	3.	 Next, you enter your web site information.
	4.	 Give your site a name, enter the address/URL, choose a 
category, and set the time zone. At the bottom, click Get 
Tracking ID:
■
■Note  The Tracking ID is the piece of information that you put on your web site, in order to 
connect it to Google.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
87
	5.	 Copy the tracking ID into memory. It will look something 
like UA-61356709-1. (It will be a specific, unique code for 
your site/blog.)
	6.	 Next, log in to your Blogger blog and go to Settings:

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
88
Then select Other:
	7.	 Enter your Google Analytics ID (Note: it will be a specific 
number you got from your own account, not the one 
shown in this image).
	8.	 Click Save Settings.
Now you’re all connected! Potentially immediately, or certainly after a few days, 
you’ll be able to go into Google Analytics and look at detailed information 
about your site.
Create a New Property for Each New Web Site
■
■Note  You can have more than one Google Analytics account, such as one for each web site, 
but generally people use one Google Analytics account and include all their web sites in that 
account.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
89
To track a new web site, you can add a new “property” to an existing account. 
For example, go to Google Analytics ➤ Admin.
Click the Property drop-down menu to create a new property. Think of this 
as digital real estate.
Then you can enter the information for each web site/blog you create and 
want to track. If you are working with a client, you will probably want to cre-
ate a separate account. If you are working on your own web sites, then you 
probably will want to just add new properties for each site/blog you work on.

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
90
■
■Note  For each new site/blog you want to track, you need a tracking ID—that’s the piece of 
information that you use to connect your web site to Google Analytics.
Google Sites: Enter the Google Analytics Tracking ID
■
■Note  This step assumes that you’ve created a new property in your Google Analytics account, 
and that you have a new tracking ID. You need a separate, unique tracking ID for each site/blog. 
You can’t use the same one in multiple sites/blogs.
At the time of this writing Google is transitioning from Classic Sites to New Sites. At the moment 
only the Classic Sites allows you to connect to Google Analytics. By the time you read this the New 
Sites might allow it too. Just give it a shot, and if it doesn’t work, try getting in touch with your 
Inner digital analytics detective, and try doing the equivalent in a free Weebly site. You make a free 
Weebly site and then research how to connect it to Google Analytics.
For Google Analytics with Classic Google Sites, go to https://sites.
google.com/ and select your site. Go into Settings (the gear icon) and select 
Manage Site:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
91
Then scroll down, make sure the Statistics drop-down menu is set to Use 
Google Analytics, and enter your property ID/tracking ID. (Note: it will be a 
specific number you got from your own Google Analytics account, not the 
one shown in the following image).

Chapter 6 | Analyze How Things Are Going
92
Click Save.
Now you’re all connected! Potentially immediately, or certainly after a few days, 
you’ll be able to go into Google Analytics and look at detailed information 
about your site.
Fun with Analytics: Using Your Superpowers
Now that you have Google Analytics and it’s been running for a few days (wait 
a few days, and also try to promote your site by sharing it on social media, if 
nothing else, to get some traffic), it’s time to take a look. Follow these steps:
	1.	 First, log in to Google Analytics.
	2.	 Check the Date Range to be aware of what time frame 
you are looking at it, and change it if desired:
	3.	 Click on All Web Site Data:
	4.	 In order to find the right report, look for the search box:
	5.	 Try typing in All Traffic Channels and select it from the 
pop-up menu:

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
93
You will get more out of it the longer you have Google Analytics installed, 
and the longer you’ve been promoting your site (so that not only are people 
visiting it based on your initial promotion, but ideally searching for it on 
Google). If you want to see what it’s like, but don’t have a web site, e-mail me 
at tekelsey@gmail.com and I will invite you to the RGB Foundations Google 
Analytics account so you can take a look around. (No promises mind you, but 
it’s an option.)
Here’s the kind of thing you’ll see. Even if you’re not doing conversion track-
ing, and just want to see what proportion of traffic is coming from organic 
searches, it’s cool:
Another thing to consider with SEO is to set the goal of increasing traffic from 
organic search over time, based on the amount and the proportion of traffic. 
In some ways, SEO is like an investment that becomes a source of ongoing 
income—you do have to maintain it, but when the right things are done and 
everything falls into place, it is possible to generate traffic, sales, etc., without 
having to spend money. Managers and clients will like this. (Technically, you are 
spending money by having someone work on SEO, but it at least sounds good. 
And there’s some legitimacy to it.)
Getting Google Analytics up and running is a good thing, and here’s an article

Conclusion
Congratulations on launching into the deep world of measuring performance 
with SEO. It can be a journey, and you might have to do a bit of exploration, 
especially for the Holy Grail (conversion tracking).
But there can be a lot of treasure involved, and I highly recommend it.
Don’t be alarmed by analytics. Just think of it as treasure hunting. Even if you’re 
not a numbers person, it’s rewarding. If I can make the journey, you can too.

This is a short chapter, but an important one.
Before you do anything, let’s take a moment to return to the “How Search 
Works” video by Matt Cutts. If you haven’t seen it yet, you should, and even if 
you’ve seen it before, it will be a helpful refresher for this particular chapter.

One issue to pay attention to and consider is how Google crawls and indexes 
the Internet. How does Google know your web site is there? There are any 
number of ways that it will find your site, based on what platform you’re on, if 
you post on social media, etc. In some cases, it’s good to verify that everything 
is okay. It would be nice if everything on the Internet worked seamlessly, but

that’s just not the case. Because of all the different systems out there, and 
because of technical and human errors, even web sites that have top technical 
staff and a lot of resources sometimes end up in a situation in which the site 
doesn’t speak to Google as well as it could. It’s good to monitor this, and it’s 
a basic thing to do as part of an SEO audit.
We’ll start with a really simple way to check things that doesn’t require any 
special tools.
Fun With SEO: Check Indexing with Google
One simple way to check out how Google sees your web site is to go to 
Google and type this in:
site:yourdomain.com
Google lists all the pages it sees. Especially with larger sites, it’s good to get 
an idea of approximately how many pages there are, and then compare this 
number to what Google is seeing. If there’s a difference, you have a problem. 
You want Google to be able to see everything that is meant to be public.
For example, you might see something like this:
What that tells me is that Google sees 26 pages. If you scroll down and click 
through the pages, you can see each one. In some cases, you might see pages 
that you forgot about or that are not supposed to be public!
The indexing example is that simple. It can be, should be, part of your SEO 
audit. It’s one of the simpler things you can do if you are doing SEO freelance 
and want to offer a free SEO audit to potential clients.

Back when it was harder to create and publish web sites, you had no choice 
but to get technical. Although some people did everything, you often had a 
distinct role of webmaster, which was part Jedi Master, part doctor.
In some cases, there still is a person who works with the web site as a full-time 
job, more often than not, on the very technical side, such as maintaining the 
web server and related systems. The larger the company, the more complex 
the web site. There might be a whole team that works behind the scenes on 
the very technical end of maintaining web sites.
Many companies, especially smaller ones, use a “managed service” such as 
Weebly.com, Wix.com, Wordpress.com, a general Internet hosting company 
like GoDaddy, or even a free service like Google Sites. In those cases, they 
manage 95% of the technical part so that you don’t have to, and in many cases 
it is automated through a system called a Content Management System. (If you 
weren’t aware, what you used to have to do, and what some sites still do, is 
create and maintain a web site manually. That means you create the files on your 
computer and upload them to a server, and the server makes them available on 
the Internet.) What a Content Management System (CMS) does is make it a lot 
easier for someone without technical skills to build a web site, basically.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization

No matter how the web site is developed, sometimes there’s still a need for 
a doctor.
That’s where Webmaster Tools/Search Console comes in. There’s even a 
Search Health function. Just like getting a check up.
Even though Webmaster Tools is now becoming Search Console, it’s still good 
to know its history and context, and when you are searching for a job, an 
SEO job description likely will still list Webmaster Tools. You should put both 
terms on your resume and on your LinkedIn profile, once you gain some 
experience with these areas.
Before we dive in, I recommend looking at this Google Webmaster Tools 
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COcl6ax38IY or http://
tinyurl.com/wmtoolsvid.
If you like, take a look at the “revised” version, which is now called the Google 
Search Console: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoxU5kz15Kc or 
http://tinyurl.com/srchvid.
Pretty minor differences, but it’s worth watching and re-watching until it sinks in.
Connecting Webmaster Tools/Search Console
An entire book could be written about Webmaster Tools/Search Console, 
and there are articles and videos as well (don’t forget to search Google for 
videos as you are learning SEO). The purpose is to get acquainted, to show 
you how it is just another Google account. As with Google Analytics, there 
may be some hoops to jump through to get connected. But getting more 
familiar with it is a good investment of your time, and you may want to go 
ahead and jump in.
To check it out, go to https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools. (If 
they update the link at some point, Google “Google Search Console” to find 
it again.) If you are signed in already with a Gmail address/Google account, it 
will go right to the site. If not, you may need to sign in with a Gmail account.
In general, what you end up with is the ability to add and manage properties. 
Think of it being like a real estate mogul. You add properties and keep track 
of them to make sure they are okay. You have someone working for you who 
lets you know if there’s an issue.

Chapter 7 | Explore Indexing and Webmaster Tools/Search Console
102
This is what I see when I sign in:
In general, you add a property, manage it, and sometimes check things. In some 
cases, there might be messages for you about something to look into; in other 
cases, they might e-mail you a message.
Let’s try adding a property. First click the Add a Property button.
Remember, with the mindset of an SEO professional and digital marketing 
learner, always click on Learn More links and the little question marks in 
Google products. You’ll be glad you did.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
103
You could add a “conventional” web site, such as www.mytshirtshop.com, 
but for this exercise, we’re adding a Google web site, which is a bit easier to 
connect. Type in your blog address as follows:
Click the Add button. In theory, Google will:
• 
Tell you that are already a verified owner. (If you aren’t, 
make sure you’re signed in to Webmaster Tools with the 
same Gmail you used to sign in and create your blog.)
• 
Allow you to verify with more than one format. It’s not 
required, but in theory makes things more secure.
For web sites that aren’t built on Google platforms (i.e., Google Sites and 
Blogger), you have to go through some kind of verification. Probably the easiest 
way to verify is to have Google analytics already set up on your site (Weebly, 
Wix, any other platform for that matter). Another verification process that 
might work is the domain provider option.

Until you want some extra credit from Dr. Kelsey and want to try one or 
more of those, click Not Now:
There will be many different options in Webmaster Tools, and I suggest explor-
ing them. Messages is an interesting option. In theory you might get e-mails, 
but it’s also a good idea to visit Webmaster Tools regularly (for example, you 
can set a recurring weekly reminder in Google calendar with an e-mail).
On the left side menu, there are things to explore like this:
Oof! Don’t feel bad if start to feel woozy when you see returns like this. 
Seriously, don’t feel bad. It’s doable. Want to know a little secret? Aside from 
the fact that I started out in rock ‘n’ roll, there’s a secret to how I became an 
expert.
In theory, I’m an industry expert. I’ve been on TV, written a bunch of books, 
worked at small, medium, and large Fortune 500 and Fortune 50 companies—
blah blah blah. But what I haven’t done is tried to learn everything about every 
tool or piece of software I come across.
Remember that you don’t have to learn everything. This entire digression has 
mostly been for the people who are intimidated by the last screenshot, with 
all the technical stuff. Suffice it to say, you can focus on the 10% of a program 
that is most learnable/doable for you now, and then learn the others later. Like 
successive coats of paint. That’s what I do. That’s the secret.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
105
Okay, now back to Search Console!
Remember that as you explore it, you can click on Help in the interface.
You can read through Google’s own guide to it, which I recommend.
Google Search Console Help Center is at https://support.google.com/
webmasters?hl=en&authuser=0#topic=3309469 or http://tinyurl.com/
searchconsolehelp.

Chapter 7 | Explore Indexing and Webmaster Tools/Search Console
106
Well, look at all that interesting stuff! Start with the fundamentals. Webmaster 
Academy! That sounds good. Go for it!
My general recommendation is simply to explore—click on everything, read 
the help material, search for videos on Google, and get comfy with the SEO 
concept.
In some cases, as with Google Analytics, it takes time for data to come in 
before there is useful information or insights. But get it going and see what 
happens. (As with Google Analytics, if you want to see a live account, e-mail me 
at tekelsey@gmail.com and I will add you to a live Google Search Console 
so you can see some live data.)
It is worth noting that among other things, you can add other users. If you 
work for a company that already has a web site and a Google Webmasters 
account, there’s likely a person who already has access. It’s also possible they 
might not know they can add users. You can ask them nicely to add you to 
the account.
That kind of thing can also come up with Google Analytics as well. If you start 
working at a company that already has an account or you take on a new client, 
you might need to ask someone to invite you to an existing Google Analytics 
account.
News Flash: Checking Rank
Things change in SEO, as well as in other areas of digital marketing. You have 
to keep tuned in to the technology news in order to keep up. Sometimes you 
just end up discovering changes in the tools.
For example, at the time of this writing, Google introduced the ability to 
check your rank for individual keywords right in the Webmaster Tools/
Search Console. This is huge, because when you start doing search engine 
optimization, and you want to report on the results of your efforts to a client 
or manager, being able to report an increase in rank is helpful. But what if your 
keyword is not in the top 100? You’re stuck if you’re using some of the other 
tools.
Once you’ve connected all the pieces to your site, including Webmaster Tools/
Search Console, you can see which keywords people are typing into Google 
that lead them to your site.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
107
To do this, go into Search Analytics:
You will see something like this:

Chapter 7 | Explore Indexing and Webmaster Tools/Search Console
108
If you click the Position checkbox:
You should see the position of the search queries, meaning their rank on 
Google.
This example tracks the Zing Green Safety Products company. The site has 
been around long enough that many people type the name of the company 
into Google. The “Zing Enterprises” phrase is number 1. This is the Holy 
Grail; the top rank in Google. It’s a little easier for your brand name. Then 
further down we see a more conventional result—the term “traffic signs in 
the workplace” has a rank of 80. That means you have to scroll through 80 
search results before you see Zing come up organically. You might see an ad 
on the very first page (created via AdWords), but the organic search result is 
number 80. An SEO-minded person would try to improve the rank for that 
keyword. With what? Content.
It takes time, but that’s the idea.
Even though it’s great that Google now allows you to check rank/position in 
the Search Console, don’t be disappointed if you start a new web site and it 
doesn’t show any keywords. It takes time, but it’s worth the effort. The more 
traffic you can get to your web site using organic search results (i.e., whereby 
you are not paying for it), the better. Most companies use a combination of 
SEM and SEO to get traffic to their sites.
A realistic way to report on the success of content development efforts 
related to search engine optimization is to learn about Google Analytics, 
including how to measure traffic in general. Ad campaigns and content can 
both increase traffic. They can increase the amount of time people spend on 
the site as well. As you build your web site, look more closely at search engine 
optimization and engage in active SEO. When it comes time to show results, 
working toward increasing your rank is one way to get there. Another way 

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
109
is to study Google Analytics, which can tell you which keywords are driving 
traffic and how much of your traffic is coming from organic search (in the 
form of referrals).
I’ve jumped ahead to some advanced stuff in this section, but when you start 
doing SEO, the Search Console is a good tool to have. It is especially helpful 
with a new web site or smaller business that might not place on the top 100, 
and where you can’t measure the results from your efforts on one of the 
larger, paid search rank tools (until they change it). Google Search Console 
may be your best friend in the hot seat.
Take time to learn Google Analytics as well. If it isn’t crystal clear, it’s important 
to be aware of how the various core areas of digital marketing relate. In 
the last several paragraphs, you’ve seen how SEO and SEM relate to Google 
Analytics, Search Console, etc.
If you haven’t yet, check out my Introduction to Google Analytics, Introduction to 
Search Engine Marketing and AdWords and Introduction to Social Media Marketing 
books.
Conclusion
Congratulations on getting your feet wet with indexing and Webmaster 
Tools/Search Console. Remember, don’t worry about absorbing everything, 
just learn how to explore. You can and will learn what you need to know over 
time.
Best wishes!

Keeping Up with 
Changes
This is perhaps the shortest chapter of any book I’ve written, and the main 
point is to emphasize that one of the parts of SEO is to keep up with changes.
It also mean looking critically at resources that might be out of date, including 
this book! Depending on when you read it of course. To balance that approach, 
I’ve tried to make this book more about learning how to learn than attempting 
to explain “eternal” SEO best practices. There are no practices that are 
eternal. Except maybe one—quality content!
Outside of looking for quality content, Google evolves and changes its 
algorithms. The entire SEO industry responds with workshops, blogs, 
webinars, seminars, conventions, and panel discussions. Sometimes Google 
makes announcements and sometimes things change quietly and people who 
are watching closely notice them. It’s just the way things go.
Part of the reason that Google doesn’t always disclose exactly how things work, 
is because in the past, present, and probably in the future, there will always 
be people who try to capitalize on exactly how things work to manipulate 
the system. They take it to an extreme and get good results for a while, but 
Google eventually catches up with them. Google’s algorithmic changes have 
also caused legitimate businesses with the proper approach to have to revamp 
everything. Even if you’re pursuing a particular business model that’s content 
related and relies on search engine rankings, an algorithmic change can have a 
large impact on your results.

For example, this is a report from a mid-2015 news article.
Google’s “phantom” algorithm update hits web sites:
• 
Search change costs sites real money
• 
Web sites were not expecting the change
• 
One site loses 22 percent of traffic overnight
Check out http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/13/ntom-algorithm-update-
hits-websites.html or http://tinyurl.com/goog-phantom.
If you still don’t believe me, look at Moz’s article entitled, “Google Algorithm 
Change History” at https://moz.com/google-algorithm-change.
Sometimes Google acknowledges these issues and sometimes they don’t.
Perhaps the biggest one in recent memory—which is still worth being aware 
of because you might be the one to explain its importance to a business or 
organization—is called “mobilegeddon”. This was when Google (with ample 
public notice) started penalizing sites that were not mobile friendly.
Suffice it to say that it’s a good idea to keep up with changes. How do you do 
that? Read on.
Keep Up with Industry Resources and Blogs
Sometimes all it takes is reading a blog post. Sometimes it’s helpful to read a 
book or attend a webinar. The best thing to do is get familiar with some of 
the industry resources out there. Here are a few that have been mentioned. 
Some are tools that also include news and others are news sites that have 
tools as well as training materials (and certifications, as you’ll learn in the next 
chapter).

Of course, try searching for “SEO news” to see what comes up in Google.
■
■Note  Remember, remember, remember—when you’re reading blog posts, look at the dates of 
publication to be sure you’re getting the latest news.
In general, the companies and sites that are focused on SEO news, such as the 
ones mentioned previously, are fairly current. They may be the ones you go 
to or hear from about the latest changes. There are also a host of blog posts 
from a variety of sources that will come up in a search, but do not reflect the 
latest changes in Google. For example, you might find a book, blog post, or 
article that talks about meta keywords. These used to be more important, 
but now they are less so. You need to look for information with a critical eye.
If you want my personal advice, go right to moz.com and subscribe to their 
blog at https://moz.com/blog.
You’ll learn something, you’ll keep updated, and you’ll be glad you did.
I also recommend exploring Search Engine News. At the time of this writing, 
they have a $1 trial. I learned about them through an agency I worked for. The 
owner found their information helpful enough that it was worth paying for. 
See www.searchenginenews.com.

Chapter 8 | Keeping Up with Changes
114
Conclusion
That’s it. Really. Keeping up with SEO trends is really important. Learning the 
best there is to know about SEO, but not keeping up with changes is a recipe 
for disaster. Get plugged in and be aware of changes and get expert opinions 
on the relative importance of changes. That’s valuable and it will help you do 
your job better.

Exploring SEO 
Certification
As you’re learning SEO—whether you are adding this skill to an existing job, or 
you’re learning this skill to boost your chances of getting a job—certification is 
something to seriously consider. In teaching the core areas of digital marketing, 
I’ve tried to integrate certification into as many classes and books as possible, 
and SEO is no different, although the “certification landscape” is not as clear as 
with search engine marketing, where you have a clear, recognized certification 
with AdWords, and with Web Analytics, where Google Analytics is free, 
accepted, and well-known.
For fun, I suggest that you take the following keywords and enter them into a 
job search in LinkedIn to see what you find:
• 
Search engine optimization
• 
SEO
• 
Google Analytics
• 
Google AdWords
• 
Google Analytics Certification
•

There is SEO, at number 4. You made the right choice in reading this book! 
Look how it is grouped with SEM. Makes sense, right? What’s also interesting 
is that marketing campaign management is number 3. That means of any skill 
to get people hired. In the world. That means there’s increasing need to gain 
experience and be able to manage campaigns, like the flow through content, 
social, AdWords, and analytics. Does that sound familiar?
Hopefully some of the discussion is helping you understand that SEO, like 
other core digital marketing areas, is connected to other areas. For example, 
we looked at how Google Analytics can be used to measure the impact of 
content used for SEO. You also learned how content can be posted to social 
media. And so on.
The reason I developed the CASA model was not to promote myself, but 
to try and find a simple way to navigate digital marketing, and to introduce 
some of the relationships. It’s not “my” tool, it’s “our” tool, and it’s a suggested 
mindset.
In light of some of these points, the next sections introduce two options for 
certification that I’ve tried, tested in classrooms and strongly recommend—
HubSpot Certification and Search Engine News.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
117
HubSpot Certification
HubSpot (www.hubspot.com) is cool. The quality of the learning material and 
the tools is top-notch. They practice what they preach, and it’s very likely that 
you’ll run across their blog posts from time to time. They are trying to promote 
themselves with the concept of “inbound marketing”. They do it in a way that 
reflects their core philosophy and best practices that they encourage—make 
your content relevant and helpful, and when you do, customers will follow.
When you visit their site, you’ll see something like this.
You may want to just go ahead and try some of their products, just to get 
familiar. They have a free CRM (customer relationship management) tool that 
can be used to track customers and relationships. Ultimately, they have tools 
that can help with inbound marketing, which is the process of doing everything 
you can to get people to visit your web site, using good content—and then 
measuring and optimizing the process.
If SEO is the process of optimizing a web site for higher rankings on Google, 
and if good quality content is the best way to do it, then inbound marketing is 
taking things to the next level. It’s the way you can do “content marketing” and 
work on not just getting higher search engine rankings, but look at ways to 
help generate and track sales using a platform like HubSpot. Sometimes they 
call it “marketing automation”. (If you want to learn more about marketing 
automation, HubSpot has a lot of material, and if you want a conversational 
introduction to HubSpot and its alternatives, see Intro to Marketing Automation 
by Todd Kelsey.)
In general, marketing automation, inbound marketing, is worth looking at, 
regardless of your business size, but it’s probably better to look at it after you 
have a solid foundation of other things. Being aware of the possibilities is a 
good thing. HubSpot and its competitors are best for businesses that have a 
B2B focus, where you have leads, a sales force, and the need to help increase 

Chapter 9 | Exploring SEO Certification
118
the conversion of leads into customers. Marketing automation helps a lot 
of this, based on the idea that 98 percent of the people who visit your site 
aren’t ready to buy. If you’ve invested in getting them to visit (with SEO, SEM), 
how can you increase the conversion rate? The answer is lead nurturing, and 
marketing automation helps with that.
The reason I think the HubSpot learning material is a good foundation for 
SEO is because it places SEO in context, and the emphasis is on content. 
Not just doing it, but planning things so that it is relevant and helpful to 
people. Their training material and certification is excellent at giving a founda-
tion in these concepts, and I strongly recommend it. It introduces things like 
Personas. If you want to explore the material and take a look at Personas, for 
example, go to http://certification.hubspot.com/inbound-certifi-
cation. You can also just visit certification.hubspot.com and choose the 
inbound certification.

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
119
Go ahead and click Start the Course. Then follow the registration process.
As a side note, one of the things to file away at the border of SEO and 
overall content marketing is the idea of getting people’s contact information 
in return for something. That’s a fundamental principle in inbound marketing, 
and that’s what’s happening with the HubSpot registration process. They 
offer free certification, they ask for your contact information, and they try to 
send helpful resources along the way. They recognize that at some point you 
might be a potential customer or in the position to recommend HubSpot to 
someone else.
As part of the registration process, you pick a password. I recommend writing 
it down so you can more easily come back in later.

Chapter 9 | Exploring SEO Certification
120
You’ll end up seeing something like this, and I suggest choosing the Inbound 
material.
Then at this point what I suggest you do is bookmark the link to this page, the 
course hub, so you can come back to it later:
Download the study guide and then check out one or two of the videos just 
to see what it’s like, maybe starting at the beginning. When you’re ready, spend 
some time each day or each week going through the material. It’s excellent, 

Introduction to Search Engine Optimization
121
and it will lead to a HubSpot Inbound Certification that you can and should 
list on your resume. For fun, try doing a job search on LinkedIn for the term 
“hubspot”.
I don’t own any stock in HubSpot and I’m not an employee. I’ve just found 
the material to be that good. They do well with visuals and simplify things to 
be sensible. There are also good sections in the training manual that cover 
important concepts of digital marketing, like stages of awareness.
For example, at one point in the material you learn about the “buyer’s journey,” 
which helps you to realize that when you have content and advertising, it’s not 
“one size fits all” and people are at different stages of the buying process. 
Knowing this, and strategically developing content based on this knowledge, is 
very powerful, and produces results.
It goes beyond SEO. If you’re in an SEO position and the company is not doing 
inbound marketing, you might want to start the conversation. If the company 
is doing inbound, you will have some knowledge about how to collaborate. If 
you’re selling digital marketing services, a client relationship might start with 
SEO, but you may be able to upsell the client on exploring inbound marketing 
and marketing automation.
The learning material also contains helps context, where the “tactical” things 
you are learning are placed in the context of an overall marketing strategy. 
There’s certainly strategy within SEO, but it doesn’t hurt to know how SEO 
fits into the larger picture, and how various aspects of digital marketing can 
combine to help generate revenue for a company. Knowledge is power—the 
power to help a company or a client succeed.
Don’t worry about necessarily “mastering” all these stages—I recommend 
becoming familiar with them. It’s knowledge that can help you as you grow in 
your skills and career.
One of my favorite parts of the HubSpot material that they do well is with 
buyer personas. In some ways you can simplify this to “listening to your 
customer”.
Buyer personas represent a concept called segmentation, and as you learn 
more about SEM and SEO, you’ll see how important it is. When you get to 
know your customers, when you go beyond the “one size fits all” mentality, you 
realize that not every customer is the same. Oftentimes there are segments. 
For example in a T-shirt business, part of the customer base might include 
coaches of local sports teams. Another segment might be bands that want 
to sell T-shirts to fans. When you start to learn more about your customers 
and tailor resources and marketing messages to their needs, the targeting 
becomes very powerful. It makes marketing and content more relevant to 
particular audiences, and therefore more valuable to them and to you.

Chapter 9 | Exploring SEO Certification
122
The HubSpot material has an entire section in the study guide and videos that 
deals with SEO, and it’s good reinforcement of best practices.
So have at it! Work on the certification, and best wishes in the process!
SEO Certification
SEO certification is a little harder to find, and generally what I’ve seen is that 
the companies that offer it are used to charging higher prices for training, 
webinars, and workshops, so it’s out of reach for most of my students (although 
it’s worth looking into if you’re a working professional).
Search Engine News is one example: https://www.searchenginenews.com/
Conclusion
This chapter covered two possibilities for SEO certification and there may be 
more as time goes on. Whatever you do, make sure that the company that 
offers certification has pertinent and current material (if you’re in doubt, ask 
them the last time they updated it). HubSpot is a pretty good, fairly stable 
company that should be around for a while, and Search Engine News is  
smaller, but also good, so we’ll see. There are also many courses you can 
take online, (at Moz, some free, some not), but I like the idea of an actual 
certification, as a goal to work toward and to get managers’ and recruiters’ 
attention.
In the end, getting experience using actual tools is as, or more, important 
than the certification. But getting a certification can be an excellent way to 
supplement experience.
On that note, depending on what your goals are, if you are learning things on 
the side and intending to bring the skill into the workplace, if you are doing 
it for yourself, or seeking a new career, I do think that internships are a good 
thing to go for. Another excellent way to get experience is to look around 
for a non-profit organization in your area and see if they want some free 
or discounted help working with SEO and/or content marketing. Oftentimes 
they prioritize their budget to direct mission, and may welcome having some 
help on their web site.
If you’re just starting out on your career, another issue to consider is the 
question of whether to seek a job as a dedicated SEO or look for a job where 
you wear multiple hats. A dedicated role focuses solely on SEO, whereas a 
multiple hats role might include SEO, but also include other areas. My general 
advice is to seek a multiple hats role, which is a little easier to break into, 
including by through an internship. This can help you get experience in each 
of the different areas. Positions such as “digital marketing coordinator”

and “Internet marketing coordinator” usually indicate the multiple hats role. 
You can search keywords like SEO or Google Analytics and often find them 
mentioned in the context of a multiple hats role.
Then, if you particularly like SEO, you might want to find a dedicated role. 
Depending on the size of the company, it might be “all technical tweaks,” but 
there might also be some room to get involved with content, and you can 
ask those questions in an interview. A company or organization or potential 
client might know that “they want to do SEO,” but not really be aware about 
things like inbound marketing. With your fancy new HubSpot certification, you 
might be in a position to help them grow. This is also true if you are already 
in a marketing department and people are talking about doing SEO. You might 
bring inbound marketing into the conversation or raise the possibility of 
things like creating a company-wide task force to help strategically identify 
and develop content that could be used to help boost SEO rank.
The world’s your oyster and I wish you the best. Feel free to connect with me
