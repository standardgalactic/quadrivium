Author’s Acknowledgments
My unending gratitude goes to Pomeranian breeders Geneva Coats
and Julie Clemen as well as the members of the Pom Forum discus-
sion group. Their suggestions were invaluable, as was their critique
of the manuscript.
I’m also indebted to editors Kristin DeMint, Pam Ruble, and Stacy
Kennedy for keeping me in line (sort of).
And to fellow dog writer Eve Adamson — she knows why.

Introduction
S
o you’re thinking about getting a Pom? Maybe you know you
want one but you’re wondering how to find a good one. Or just
maybe you’re already a proud Pom parent and want to find out
more about sharing your life with your puffy pal. Whatever your
reasons, you’re off to a great start by discovering more about one
of dogdom’s cutest breeds.
Have you heard the saying that small dogs are just big dogs in little
bodies? That’s certainly true with Poms — the heart of a lion and
the looks of a miniature lion. That fun little package has a lot of
good stuff packed into it, and I wrote this book the same way —
lots of stuff in a fun little package. I hope you’ll have fun (and learn
a lot) exploring both.
About This Book
This book is for prospective and current Pomeranian owners. It has
all the information you need to get you from your first notion of
wanting a Pom all the way through the next decade and more.
In these pages you find answers to questions like the following:
 Am I insane for even thinking about getting a dog?
 Is a tiny dog right for me?
 What’s special about Poms compared to other toy dogs?
 How do I find a good, healthy Pomeranian and avoid getting
ripped off?
 How do I get ready for my new puffball of a dog?
 How do I introduce my new Pom to the world around him so
he’s a well-adjusted dog?
 Why are frequent feedings sometimes a matter of life and
death for tiny dogs, especially puppies?
 Is it hard to keep her coat looking good?
 How can I stop these puddles on the floor?
 Is there a secret to training this dog?
 How do I cope with bad behaviors?

Pomeranians For Dummies 
2
 How do I know whether my dog is sick, and what do I do?
 How do I get started with the fun stuff?
You may be more interested in some of these questions than
others. That’s fine. Feel free to skip around. You won’t hurt my 
feelings. Go ahead and mark up pages and highlight points, too.
This is a reference book, meant to be dog-eared and dog-chewed.
That just shows you’ve put it to good use.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you find what you want quickly, I use a few conventions
when it comes to typeface.
 Italic is used to highlight new terms that are defined in
the text.
 Boldface is used to indicate the action part of numbered
steps.
 Monofont is used for Web and e-mail addresses.
In the interest of gender quality, I vary the wording so that some
sections refer to a male Pomeranian and some to a female. Unless
I’m discussing the features of one sex exclusively, the text with
male or female pronouns applies to both sexes.
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, I hope you read every one of the golden and invaluable
words in this book. But even I have to admit you don’t have to read
it all in order to be a good and informed Pomeranian owner. You
can skip the nonessential stuff, and I’ve even made it easy for you
to identify what’s skippable:
 Text in sidebars: Those shaded boxes you see here and there
contain interesting but not really essential information. You
can save those for leisure reading.
 Text highlighted with a Technical Stuff icon: As much as it pains
me to say this, you don’t really have to read these sections —
even though I think they’re the most interesting parts. (Besides,
they give you some great stuff to bore your friends with!)
I always summarize the info elsewhere so you don’t have to
dig through the why of everything.

Foolish Assumptions
When I was writing this book, I made some assumptions — I hope
not too foolish — concerning you and what sort of information you
want to find:
 You’re considering a Pomeranian but you know that dogs
differ as much in personality as they do in looks; you want to
find out whether a Pomeranian is really the dog for you.
 You’ve decided on a Pomeranian but want to make sure you
get a good one.
 You’re preparing for your new dog and want to make sure he
gets off on the right paw.
 You’re on your hands and knees, soaking up that spot on the
carpet again, wondering what it takes to housetrain one of
these critters.
 You’re trying to train your Pom with commands just like you
did your last dog, but it’s not working. Is there some secret
to this?
 You want to provide the best health care possible for your
Pomeranian.
 You just love the breed and want to lap up as many interesting

This book is a paragon of organization. Sort of. Each of the five
parts centers on a general topic and contains chapters with spe-
cific information about that topic.
Part I: Pomeranians:
What’s Not to Love?
It’s easy to fall in love with a dog and particularly with a Pomeranian,
but do your circumstances allow you to bring a Pom into your life?
The chapters in Part I help you with all those initial questions
like what does the Pomeranian breed offer; what are the choices
(age, gender, color, and pet or show quality); are you and a Pom a
good match; and how do you find the right Pom for you?

Part II: When Your House
Becomes Your Pom’s Home
The best time to get ready for your new Pom is before you have
your dog underfoot. This part shows you how to prepare your
home, from Pom proofing to Pom spoiling. It gives you ideas on
what to buy and where to put it. And when you’re ready to bring
your new dog home, this part supplies handy tips to make the trip
and subsequent homecoming as nontraumatic as possible. Still,
those first few days — and especially the nights! — can be chal-
lenging unless you know the best ways to deal with them.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom
from Head to Paw
One of the best parts of having a Pom is the excuse to pamper and
primp him to your heart’s content, so this part offers information
about basic dog care including helpful tips about tiny dogs. But the
chapters also have information on nutrition, feeding schedules,
health care, and the hereditary health conditions that Pomeranians
are susceptible to. Finally, because you and your Pom eventually
want to spread your wings, this chapter prepares both of you for
those trips beyond your back door.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC
They may be tiny, but they can still be mighty determined. And
when Poms are bad, it’s almost always the fault of poor training.
Small dogs can be annoying — to the point that your friends may
run when they see the two of you coming. And even a nip can do
some damage, especially to a child. This part contains vital infor-
mation on housetraining and basic commands, emphasizing the
latest techniques based on positive rewards. Despite the best
training, dogs sometimes come up with behavior problems that
need special attention, and this part also covers those situations.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part, a standard fare in all For Dummies books, offers quick
lists of fun information. Want to discover some great activities for
you and your Pom? Look here. Look here, too, to find out some fun
Pom facts.

What’s Not to Love?

In this part . . .
P
uffballs, powder puffs, tribbles, or ewoks — a Pom 
by any other name is just as cute. But before falling
under the Pomeranian spell, make sure you fall in love
with the inner Pom as much as the outer Pom. And make
sure you know what you’re committing to for the next
decade and more.
In this part I ask you to do some honest soul-searching
about whether you’re ready for a Pom — or for any dog.
As much as you may love them, a true test of love is some-
times agreeing to wait. In this case, I’m asking you ﬁrst to
consider the pros and cons of living with a tiny dog and
with a Pom in particular.
If you decide to take the Pom plunge, this part guides you
also in ﬁnding a good Pomeranian breeder. This Pom is
going to be a member of your family — make sure you 
put more effort into this choice than you would for a 
new toaster! After you ﬁnd a breeder, I give you tips on
evaluating the litter and picking your own Pom pal.

aybe it’s been a long-time dream. Or maybe just a sudden
impulse. Perhaps you saw one in a fashion magazine, or car-
ried by a celebrity, or on television, or strutting at a dog show.
Maybe your neighbor has one. Whatever the reason, the notion
has burrowed into your brain and it just won’t leave. You can’t
think of anything else. You have to have your very own Pom.
But before you pencil a Pom onto your shopping list, stop and
think. A dog is a living, breathing being that will depend on you for
the rest of his life. You’ll be responsible for feeding, walking,
grooming, and cleaning up after your littlest family member for the
next decade or more. Think hard before entering into that kind of
commitment.
The best time to make sure the Pomeranian is really the dog for
you is before you bring one home. If you’re thinking of meeting a
puppy to help you decide, stop right now! Don’t take a single step
toward that puppy or you will be coming home with him. There is
absolutely no way you can make an objective decision in sight of a
pouncing Pom puppy. So read first, look later — and enjoy for a
lifetime!
The Toy-Dog Extravaganza:
Pom Popularity
Tiny toy dogs are all the rage these days. Keep in mind, though,
that small dogs aren’t for everybody.

Tiny dogs do have a lot of advantages when it comes to conven-
ience, but they also take some extra care and worry. I explain the
pros and cons of tiny dogs in Chapter 2, so please read it and think
seriously about the good, the bad, and the ugly — as well as the
snugly — before pouncing on the notion of a little dog.
Dogs aren’t fashion accessories like purses, shoes, or even giant
stick pins, no matter how tiny and cute they are. And just because
a dog happens to be in at the moment isn’t reason enough to get
her as a pet. Dogs come in and out of style, and fads change even
before a puppy can grow up. But the worst fashion statement ever
is when a person buys a dog as an adornment and then discards
her when she’s out of style.
Now, off my soapbox and back to Poms. Of all the tiny dogs to
choose from (which I cover in the “Toy-dog breeds” sidebar), Poms
are different because they’re the only ones that come from a Spitz
heritage. I discuss this and other aspects of Pomeranian history in
Chapter 2. For now, suffice it to say that Spitz dogs are the same
family that pulls sleds in the Iditarod, hunts moose, and guards
homes. To do these jobs, Spitz dogs need to be independent and
strong willed. Poms may be little, but they have big spirits and
big ideas.
Like all dogs, Poms have some frustrating behaviors. They bark
(actually, a lot). They chase little animals. They’d rather go hunting
than sleep in your lap. They roll in disgusting places, they eat

disgusting stuff, and then they jump in your lap and kiss you in the
face. They dig (but at least the holes are small!). They may have
accidents in the house. They may have irrational fears or bizarre
ideas. After all, they’re dogs!
Fortunately, the good far outweighs any bad. Poms love to go
places with you, whether it’s a trip across the country, across
town, or across the room. They’re as ready to play as they are to
snuggle. They’re cute — boy, are they cute! Most of all,
Pomeranians prove that you really can buy love.
Sizing Up Your Situation: Know
What a Pom Requires
Before you contemplate getting a Pom, take a step back and think
about whether you’re in a position to get a dog at all. Consider
these three issues:
 Having a dog is a full-time, long-term commitment. If you’re
not into commitment, be sure you think through this decision.
A dog will certainly commit to you, but if you change your
mind, a shelter may be his only recourse — and that’s likely to
be a one-way trip.
 Dogs require your time on a daily basis. Sharing your life
with a dog means you have to be part-time groundskeeper,
home-repair expert, animal trainer, nutritionist, nurse, thera-
pist, recreation coach, and of course, full-time best friend.
 Dogs usually aren’t free. The cost of buying the dog is nomi-
nal compared to the cost of his upkeep through the years. But
this initial cost is a consideration. Pomeranians are neither
the most- nor the least-expensive breed around. You generally
want to avoid bargain basement Poms and the most expensive
retail Poms because neither is a good deal in the long run.
Find out why in Chapter 3.
Can you commit to the friendship?
Dogs have the label of being man’s best friend for a reason. They
bask in your attention and soak up your love, returning your affec-
tion tenfold. Poms are no exception. Yes, they can survive without
human interaction, but that means you’d miss out on the real
meaning of having a dog.
Chapter 1: Catching Pomer-mania 11

If you work all day and then come home too tired to do anything
but zone out in front of the television and flop into bed, you proba-
bly don’t have time for a dog of any breed. Leaving a dog alone all
day with no companionship or entertainment is possible, but it
isn’t fair. Some large cities have doggy day care, or you may be
able to hire somebody to come and entertain your dog every day.
Even another dog to play with can make a big difference. But all
this effort just to replace you? Think twice before getting a dog if
you can’t be her best friend.
Do you have a home fit for a Pom?
Do you own or rent your home? If you rent, your ability to live
exactly where you want is a lot more difficult with a dog. You may
be turned away from at least half the rental properties, and you’ll
pay a nonrefundable pet fee (with possibly an added charge per
month) when you do find a landlord that allows dogs. And what if
you move and can’t find a place that allows dogs? If your future is
unsettled, this may not be the right time for a dog.
A house with a yard is ideal, but Poms are equally happy in an
apartment. Despite their sled-dog heritage, Poms aren’t outdoor
dogs because they lose heat more rapidly than they create it. In
other words, little dogs get cold fairly easily. And in warm weather,
the survival-of-the-fittest law dictates that little animals are easy
prey for big animals. So your Pom may enjoy spending time out-
doors, but he’s not the kind of dog you can just lock in the back-
yard for the day — and certainly not for the night.
You also need to Pom proof your home, both indoors and out, by
hiding any poisons, securing anything that may fall on your dog,
preventing your dog from falling from high places, and protecting
him from predatory people and animals. Chapter 5 alerts you to
these doggy dangers.
Can you afford to feed and
care for a dog?
Although the food bill for a Pom isn’t as big a deal as it is for some
breeds of dogs (thanks to the Pom’s size), feeding a tiny dog isn’t a
slam dunk. They eat so little that you have to be careful not to
throw off their balanced diet with too many treats. And hypo-
glycemia (low blood sugar) can be a real threat, especially with
puppies. I explain all this, along with some tips on special diets, in
Chapter 8.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love?

Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 

A dog needs a bed and a bevy of other supplies (some are necessi-
ties and some are just to pamper your Pom) including food dishes,
brushes, a crate, a carrying bag, toys, and all sorts of items you
can’t believe they make for dogs. Chapter 5 gives you some ideas
for your shopping list.
In addition to the obvious financial responsibilities of feeding a dog
and buying the initial supplies, you need a plan to safeguard your
Pom’s health on an ongoing basis. This plan includes the following:
 Finding a good veterinarian before your dog gets sick
 Taking preventive measures such as vaccinations, deworming,
and heartworm treatments
 Arranging for checkups
Keep in mind that the tests aren’t just money-grabs from your
veterinarian but important indicators of your dog’s health.
 Deciding on spaying and neutering
They can have some real health benefits for a Pom. As the
owner, you need to understand their pros and cons.
 Knowing and watching for signs of doggy discomfort or
disease
Study Chapter 10 so you can nip a problem in the bud.
 Knowing what problems to look for in an older dog
Exact yearly veterinarian costs are difficult to project, but some
averages may be helpful to you as a new dog owner:
 Yearly checkup: $80 to $130
 Yearly teeth cleaning: $200
 Spaying or neutering: $200
 Unplanned trips to the veterinary clinic several times a year:
$40 (false alarm) to $80 (with antibiotics) to enough that you
need to be hospitalized when you see the bill.
To get a better idea on average costs for your area, call some local
veterinary offices to ask about their prices for routine office visits
and spaying or neutering a toy dog. You can also ask about emer-
gency fees, but expect a charge of at least a few hundred dollars to
see a veterinarian in the middle of the night.
Dogs of any breed can get sick. Dogs of tiny breeds can get very
sick very fast. And Pomeranians, like all breeds, have breed-specific
predispositions to hereditary disorders. You’ll be ahead of the
Chapter 1: Catching Pomer-mania 13

game to know which problems demand a visit to the veterinarian
eventually, today, or right this very second. And you’ll want to
know which first-aid options, home remedies, and long-term nurs-
ing plans can help your Pom get better. Chapter 11 guides you
through some of the more common health problems your Pom
may encounter.
Do you have the time or 
cash to groom a dog?
Part of the enjoyment of cuddling with a Pom is snuggling your
face in her fur and running your fingers through her coat. But
that’s not going to be much fun if she smells like a dead rat and
feels like a solid felt pad. And that doggy breath — whew!
Grooming a Pom isn’t really that hard, but it includes more than
just washing and combing her coat. It involves keeping the teeth
clean, the nails short, and the fleas off. Chapter 9 shows you all
the moves.
If you keep to schedule, grooming takes about 15 minutes twice a
week. But if you let mats form, expect to spend an hour or more
dematting.
Your Pomeranian doesn’t need professional grooming, but some
people simply hate to groom or they want their Pom clipped.
Depending on the salon and the services, expect to pay $20 to $50.
If you want a groomer or your veterinarian staff to cut your dog’s
nails (at least monthly), it usually runs $5 to $10.
Do you have the time and energy
to play with a dog?
Like all dogs, Poms need mental and physical exercise every
day. In fact, they’re bundles of energy (compliments of their Spitz
heritage). Without enough stimulation, they can become frus-
trated and destructive, barking, chewing, and running in circles.
Fortunately, exercising them doesn’t take much space or energy
on your part.
Throwing a ball in an apartment several times a day is an easy
start. But you can do a lot more. For example:
 Challenge him with hiding games, teach him tricks, and make
him work for his supper.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
14
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 

 Take him outdoors and just let him soak in the smells. A walk
around the block can do both of you good.
 Keep him busy and thinking with interactive toys while
you’re gone.
 Take a trip together. With a little planning, your Pom can be
your ideal travel companion.
Check out Chapter 16 for more ideas on entertaining, exercis-
ing, socializing, and even competing with your Pomeranian.
Do you have the patience
to train a dog?
Dogs that run free, totally unschooled in manners and basic knowl-
edge, are unpopular with people and a danger to themselves and
others. Your dog deserves to be trained so she’s the best that she
can be. You don’t need to be a drill sergeant — just smarter than
the average Pom.
Training can save your dog’s life. For example, she needs to come
when called, especially if she’s off leash and headed toward traffic.
She needs to stop acting like a jerk when she’s challenging the giant
dog who isn’t amused. And she needs to know not to bite people.
Training cements the bond between you and your Pom. In the old
days, punishment-based training made training sessions no fun for
man or beast. But now, reward-based training has your dog beg-
ging for the next session. You see how to do this in Chapter 14.
Do you travel much?
Does your job or hobby take you away from home a lot? If so,
where will your dog stay? Boarding costs can range from $8 to $30
a day, depending on whether you want him to have a cage at the
kennel or a deluxe suite complete with television privileges.
And don’t forget doggy day care! Larger cities often have facilities
where you drop your dog off for the day. Better day-care centers
offer supervised play and training. Costs may be as high as overnight
boarding, but many dogs end up pulling you to the door in their
excitement to go see their friends there!
Maybe you plan to take your dog with you on the road. If you go by
air, you’ll pay an extra fee for him, about $50 per flight. And many
motels charge a dog fee as well, usually an extra $10 per night.

Chapter 12 outlines the best ways of traveling with your furry
companion.
Double-Checking Your Motives:
Why Do You Want a Pom?
Chances are you’ve thought long and hard about getting a furry,
fun-loving friend. But even with the best intentions, you may need
to step back and cool off enough to objectively re-evaluate your
choices and timing. After all, adding a family member is a big
decision!
Recognizing your reasons 
for wanting a Pom
Some people jump into this commitment for the wrong reasons.
Check out the following not-so-great reasons (and some follow-up
responses) to see whether they come close to any of yours:
 All the cool celebrities have tiny dogs. Yes, but do they
spend much time with their pet when the cameras aren’t click-
ing? Besides, do they care about expenses?
 Toy dogs are the ultimate fashion accessory. What happens
when the toy-dog fad is over? And it will be over — count on it.
 A tiny dog is perfect for luring members of the opposite sex.
How long will that person stay before saying, “It’s me or the
dog!”? Better question: Which one will you choose?
 A friend has a wonderful Pom. Great! That means you can
play with hers without spending money on your own. Besides,
what are the chances yours will be just like hers?
 Dogs are good jogging partners. Hello! Poms? Well, that’s one
way to make sure you don’t jog far . . . although you can carry
her in a back sack and burn a few extra calories that way.
 A dog can snap to it and do the owner’s bidding. Two words:
Spitz heritage (read Chapter 2).
 Previous pets had behavior problems. Chances are the
lapses in behavior weren’t their fault. Dogs aren’t perfect, and
getting rid of them isn’t a humane plan. Chapters 13, 14, and
15 can put an owner on the right training path.

Hesitating after a loss
You may have found yourself in the sad position of having recently
lost a beloved dog. Half your friends advise you not to get another
dog (at least not soon), and half advise you to get another one as
quickly as possible. This situation is different for everybody.
You know you can never replace your past dog. Even if that dog
was a Pom of the same sex, color, and lineage, each dog is an indi-
vidual. Consider these two lines of thinking:
 If you feel you’ll be constantly comparing your new dog to
your old one, that’s not fair. The new one can never be the
same.
 If you accept that this new dog isn’t a replacement but an indi-
vidual that can charm you in his own way, then your new Pom
isn’t displacing your old dog from your heart — he’s merely
snuggling alongside your memories.
When you have the right frame of mind, a new Pomeranian can
provide a much-needed diversion that helps move your mind in
better directions. And what better way to honor your earlier dog
than to want another?
Knowing when you’re ready
to bite the bullet
You’ve checked your situation, your finances, and the Pomeranian
personality. You want a dog for a companion — a true friend who
shares your lap by night and a jaunt around the block by day. You
can’t wait to help her grow into the best Pom she can be, and
you’re eager to try a few doggy activities with her.
You admire her combination of spunk and cuteness and don’t
expect her to fawn all over you. You plan on training her but aren’t
expecting her to be a little soldier and obey all the commands. You
plan to care for and love her like any other true family member,
and you hope to have her for as long as possible.
You know that to be the best Pomeranian caretaker you can be,
you may need to do a little reading. Great! That’s where the rest of
this book comes in.
Chapter 1: Catching Pomer-mania 17

Thinking about Breeding?
As you envision yourself writing out that big check and clutching
that American Kennel Club registration, you may say to yourself,
“Hey, I could breed Poms.” You may even start calculating how
you’d recoup your purchase price with the first litter or the second
stud fee. And you may think ahead a few years to the time your
home is covered with hoards of puffy moneymakers, each churning
out litters while you just lean back and count the cash. Dream on.
Raising puppies is hard work. If you’re considering raising Poms as
a business, be aware that caring for a multitude of dogs is a full-
time job. You have to feed, poop scoop, groom, socialize, train,
exercise, medicate, and love every dog every day. You have to be
present for the whelping, and you may need to devote yourself to
hand raising orphaned or sick puppies for several weeks.
Raising puppies is also expensive. To breed the right way, the
potential parents need to be cleared for hereditary health prob-
lems such as luxating patellas, bad hearts, or eye problems, all of
which can cost several hundred dollars.
Raising puppies is a huge responsibility in the following ways:
 You owe it to your buyers to provide only healthy, well-
socialized companions, just like you looked for in your
search for a puppy.
 You owe it to your dam (the puppies’ mom) to make sure she
survives the endeavor. Dams, especially those of toy breeds,
can die in whelping. They often need Caesarean sections to
save their lives. After whelping, they are subject to eclampsia,
a potentially fatal condition that causes convulsions. It’s your
responsibility to make sure she emerges as healthy as when
she went into childbirth.
 You owe it to your puppies to make sure they go only to the
best homes. Will their family have only passing interest in
them? Be impatient or cruel? You have to be ready to say
No to families that won’t be good owners.
 You owe it to the breed to maintain the high standards
that breeders have maintained for more than a century.
Pomeranians who are bad pets, who bite, or who are
unhealthy, chip away at the breed’s reputation and well-being.
If you can be the sort of breeder that you’d like to buy a puppy
from, you may be breeder material. Chapter 3 highlights the
makeup of a good breeder.

F
alling in love with Pomeranians and deciding this is the breed
for you is easy. But picking a dog based just on looks is as
naïve as picking a mate based on looks. Sure, Poms and handsome
spouses are fun to be seen with in public, but you may find you
have irreconcilable differences at home. And although you can
divorce your spouse and go your merry ways, divorcing your Pom
can mean sealing his fate — sending him to a shelter, where he
won’t necessarily find a new home. So find out what’s in a Pom
before you decide to put a Pom in your life.
Eyeing the Standard: The
Pomeranian Blueprint
What makes a Pomeranian a Pomeranian? The short answer is,
DNA. But because you can’t whip out your handy DNA test kit, you
need to rely on what you see.
That’s where the standard comes in. Every American Kennel Club
(AKC) breed has its own standard of perfection that describes not
only the essence of the breed but also the little details that make
up the perfect specimen. The standard is the result of vigorous
efforts on the part of breeders to describe the ideal Pom (both in
physique and personality) when each breed was accepted for AKC
recognition.

Periodically, the standard may change slightly to clarify certain
points or even to make certain traits — like new colors that may
have cropped up or extremes in sizes — more or less desirable.
However, such changes are never made lightly. The American
Pomeranian Club (APC) is responsible for safeguarding the Pom
standard. The first APC standard was adopted in 1916; subsequent
standards were adopted in 1935, 1960, 1980, 1991, and 1997 (the
current version).
I describe the basic points of the standard in the following two sec-
tions. For the exact wording or to compare the present standard
with earlier versions, go to the APC site at www.american
pomeranianclub.org/standard.htm.
The gist of the Pom: General
appearance
How do you describe a Pomeranian? For starters, you don’t talk
about the shape of his feet or any other of the important, but tiny,
details. Instead you begin with his essence — the parts of the stan-
dard regarding general appearance. For the Pom, the description is
 A compact, short-backed toy dog
 A profuse outer coat and a plumed tail that lies flat on his back
 An active, alert, cocky, commanding, and inquisitive nature
Of course, there’s more to a Pom than that, so the rest of the stan-
dard fills in the details. I cover these in the next section.
From head to toes: Pom specifics
The standard may seem like a lot of detail, but then they say the
Pom is in the details . . . or something like that. (See Figure 2-1 for
an illustration of this royal dog.) The following are only the main
points:
 Size, proportion, and substance: He’s a sturdy, medium-
boned dog weighing 3 to 7 pounds (ideally, 4 to 6 pounds),
slightly taller than long.
 Head: His expression is foxlike, with small, high-set, erect
ears; he has dark, almond-shaped eyes of medium size and a
rather short, fine, but not snippy, muzzle; the top of his skull
is slightly rounded but not domed, and it doesn’t have a soft
spot; his teeth meet in a scissors bite with the top incisors
just barely in front of the bottom ones.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
20

Figure 2-1: The Pomeranian breed standard.
 Neck and Body: He carries his head proud and high; a short
neck leads to a short, level back, which in turn leads to a tail
that lies flat and straight on the back; the body is compact,
with the ribcage meeting the elbows.
 Forequarters: His forelegs are straight and parallel to each
other with strong, straight pasterns leading to well-arched,
compact feet that point straight ahead; the length of his legs
is such that his elbows are halfway between the ground and
the highest point of his shoulder.
 Hindquarters: Viewed from behind, his legs are straight and
parallel to each other; from the side, his buttocks are well
behind the set of the tail; the knees are moderately bent, and
the hocks are perpendicular to the ground; the well-arched,
compact feet point straight ahead; as in the front, he stands
mostly on his toes, not his heels.
 Gait: When he trots, his front legs reach well out in front and
his rear legs push off with a strong drive, the whole impres-
sion being smooth, balanced, and vigorous. The faster he
goes, the more his legs converge in a straight line toward a
center line beneath his body.
 Coat: His coat is made up of two parts: a thick, soft, dense
undercoat and a long, straight, glistening, harsh outer coat.
The thick undercoat makes the outer hairs stand off from his
Chapter 2: What’s in a Pom? 21

body, giving him a puffball appearance. The coat is heaviest
around the neck and the forepart of the chest and shoulders;
it is shortest on the head and legs. The coat on the rear of his
legs down to the pastern and hock is feathered; his tail is pro-
fusely covered with long, harsh, straight hair.
 Color: All colors and patterns are equal in desirability:
• Black and tan: The tan is rich and clearly defined over
the eyes, on the muzzle, throat, and forechest, on all legs
and feet, and below the tail.
• Brindle: The base color of gold, red, or orange has
strong, black, vertical stripes.
• Parti-color: Colored areas appear on white; a white
blaze is preferred.
 Temperament: He is extroverted, intelligent, and vivacious; a
great companion and a competitive show dog.
Beneath the Fur: Pom
Anatomy 101
A Pom may look like a puffball of fur, but beneath it lies a real dog
that has all the same parts as other dogs — and wolves! No one
expects you to become a canine anatomist and know the names of
every part of your Pom’s body. But knowing the basic parts helps
you understand the breed standard, and it comes in handy when
you’re trying to describe your dog’s boo-boo to the veterinarian.
Basically, your Pom’s body is like yours. Sort of. But if you could
get down on all fours, stand on your fingers and toes, and grow a
tail, you’d have a better idea of how your parts matched up. (Just
don’t do this when you’re expecting company!)
The following is a list of the more common parts:
 Your dog’s toes are his fingers.
 His hand, or pastern, is actually off the ground.
 His elbow is way up there almost to his chest.
His upper arm is next to his body.
 His shoulder blades reach up to form a high point above his
spine; this point is called the withers.

 His heels (or hocks) are in his hind legs and are well off the
ground.
 His knee is called a stifle.
 His lower back is called his croup.
Figure 2-2 illustrates parts of Pomeranian anatomy. It’s helpful to
locate them on your own dog for practice and then compare them
to your own anatomy for fun!

Small Package, Big Personality
Poms sure look cute — but you know how looks can be deceiving!
Luckily, there’s no deception in the Pom’s case. These little spit-
fires act as cute as they look. This section contains my top eight
traits that make Poms so unique.
Great balls of fire!
Poms are full of energy, their little pistonlike legs moving in a blur
as they rush from one place to the next. If Poms were big dogs,
they’d travel miles every day and drive their people quite insane.
Fortunately, they’re small, and even though they travel great dis-
tances, they can do it all inside your home by scurrying from room
to room.

The Pomeranian genealogy
Pomeranians descend from one of the most ancient lines of domesticated dogs, the
Spitz family. Spitz-type dogs were associated with hunter-gatherers at least 6,000
years ago.
The Spitz have retained many of the traits that helped their ancestors (European
wolves) survive in cold climates. They have thick, weather-resistant coats for
warmth; small, furry ears that are less susceptible to heat loss and frostbite; a
bushy tail to cover the nose when sleeping; and a muzzle of moderate length to
warm incoming air.
Over time, various subtypes of Spitz breeds developed according to the needs of
the geographical regions. For example, some Spitz were used as sledge dogs,
some as herders, and, last but not least, some smaller ones as house dogs whose
main function was to sound the alarm at danger. Sound familiar?
Little is known about the Pomeranian dog of long ago except that it was a Spitz
dog weighing about 30 pounds, not the tiny darling we know today. The breed’s
home country is Pomerania, in what is now part of northern Poland and Germany.
Poms were prized pets not only in Pomerania but also throughout Europe, attract-
ing notables such as Michelangelo, Mozart, and Isaac Newton.
The Pomeranian came to Britain in 1767. In 1888, Queen Victoria spotted an espe-
cially small Pomeranian while she was on a trip to Florence, Italy. (Marco weighed
only 12 pounds when most Pomeranians were weighing closer to 20 pounds.) She
brought him home and exhibited him at an English dog show, thus setting the trend
for smaller Poms. When specimens started to mature below 8 pounds, they were
dubbed Toy Pomeranians. Marco was also a red sable at a time when most Poms
were white, black, or white and black. But by the end of the 19th century, most
Poms were small and red. Ah, the pull of royalty!
By the beginning of the 20th century, Pomeranians were one of the most popular
breeds registered or shown in England. The smaller size and greater variety of vivid
colors did much to make the breed a dog of fashion that no well-dressed lady could
be without.
Poms were also catching on in America, although, without the royal example, the
trend was a little bit slower. In 1888 the first Pom was entered into the American
Kennel Club’s (AKC) stud book, and in 1892 the first one was exhibited at an
American dog show. The AKC officially recognized the Pomeranian in 1900, the
same year the Pomeranian Club of America was founded. The breed grew in pop-
ularity, becoming one of the ten most popular AKC breeds in the 1930s. It again
entered the top ten in 1994, where it remained for many years.

Nonetheless, don’t let their small size fool you into thinking you can
ignore them. In a pinch they can exercise on their own, but they
need the mental exercise that only you can provide. Without that
stimulation, a Pom finds his own entertainment and challenges —
and then exercises his mind by getting into trouble!
He needs the chance to stretch his legs and expand his mind every
day. This means you need to play with him, make sure he gets a
workout, and train him every day. Just like the big dogs, he looks
forward to outdoor adventures like a romp in the yard or a walk
around the block. Make your outings adventurous by exploring
new routes and places every day. Nobody likes to get in a rut — a
bored Pom is a bad Pom, but a tired Pom is a good Pom.
Cuddle-up pup
What about being a lap dog? Poms enjoy cuddling in your lap and
being spoiled, but only after they’ve had a chance to run around
and be dogs.
Poms are affectionate but not fawning. They tend to be very
attached to their family, often choosing one member as their spe-
cial person.
Perky and playful
Poms just want to have fun! This fun-loving fuzz ball is always
eager to play a game. For instance, he loves to play big-game
hunter with tiny, stuffed, squeaky toys and may find a thrown ball
irresistible.
He won’t back down from a game of tug of war, but be careful not
to pull too hard or he may go flying — and he can do all this inside
your apartment! (But be sure you get outside too. See the previous
section “Great balls of fire!”)
Fit and fancy-free
Pomeranians descend from one of the most ancient lines of domes-
ticated dogs, the Spitz family, which has been associated with
hunter-gatherers for at least 6,000 years. (See the sidebar “The
Pomeranian genealogy” for more on their background.) But a Pom
doesn’t just look like a miniature Spitz. She also acts like the tough
northern dog whose ancestors pulled sleds and sounded the alarm
if intruders came calling. That’s no work for sissy dogs.
Chapter 2: What’s in a Pom? 25

Spitz dogs have always relied on their own thinking to get the job
done. In the same tradition, Pomeranians don’t just sit around
scratching their ears, waiting for your next command — they’re
already acting out their own plan. As a result, Poms are constantly
checking out new sights and don’t mind telling your company
they’re not welcome. (Yes, they can be a little suspicious of
strangers — it’s the Spitz way.) That’s why early socialization and
training are vital for Pomeranians.
The little brainiac
Pomeranians are incredibly bright (although their independent
nature means they often use their intelligence to get into mischief).
And they won’t be bullied into compliance — their Spitz ancestry
makes them too good at digging in their heels. That’s why positive,
reward-based training methods work so well with them. When you
convince your Pom that your way pays off for him, he becomes
your apt and willing pupil. In fact, many Pomeranians have attained
high honors in obedience trials, and they’re adept at picking up
new tricks.
Bold and brash
One of the less-bright traits of Poms is forgetting their size. They
tend to approach much larger dogs with brash cockiness, almost
daring them to cross the line. The bluff often works — the big dogs
back away from this mighty mouse — but not always. As a Pom
owner, you want to make sure your dog doesn’t overestimate
herself.
Watchdog extraordinaire
Smaller Spitz dogs were used as watchdogs, and the Pomeranian
certainly doesn’t disappoint in that regard. This perky patroller is
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love?

It’s the Spitz
Pomeranians are the smallest of the dogs considered to be in the Spitz family. Spitz
breeds tend to have wolflike or foxlike wedge-shaped heads, small ears, thick
double coats, bushy tails curled over the back, and a stocky build. They are inde-
pendent by nature. Other Spitz breeds include the Akita, Siberian Husky, American
Eskimo Dog, and a host of others.

always on the alert, sounding the alarm if anything is even slightly
amiss.
Sometimes they can get carried away in the barking department,
so it’s important to train your dog when to bark and when to obey
your command to be quiet. Holding his tongue is a challenge for
most Poms, though! After all, he does have very strong opinions,
and he expects you to listen to them.
Protection dog — not so much!
Of course, if a burglar decides to ignore the barking, your Pom
probably isn’t too much help in ripping him to shreds.
Nevertheless, at least one Pom has been proclaimed a hero for
attacking an armed intruder and saving his mistress. I was so
impressed that I include him as one of the most famous Poms in
Chapter 17.
All Things Considered: The Pros
and Cons of Poms
As cute as Poms are, you’d expect them to be the most popular
dog in America. In fact, they’re not far from it. Toy dogs have been
steadily gaining in popularity since the turn of the millennium, with
an almost alarming increase in their numbers. Pomeranians were
among the top-10 most popular AKC breeds in the mid-1990s; since
then, they’ve been passed by other toy breeds but they still remain
in the top 15.
Even with all their advantages, though, Poms aren’t for everyone.
This section can help you see how Pom perks and pitfalls balance
out for you.
The not-so-great points
On the down side, no dog, not even a Pom, is perfect for every
person and situation. While small size has big advantages, it also
has disadvantages worth considering, as do some other Pom char-
acteristics. For example:
 Toy dogs can be seriously injured by jumping off of furniture,
being dropped, or being stepped on.
 They can trip you easily.
Chapter 2: What’s in a Pom? 27

 They’re too fragile for very young children to play with safely.
 They can’t go jogging with you, can’t get far hiking, can’t do a
good job of protecting you, and can’t do some dog sports
aimed at larger dogs.
 Housetraining can be more of a challenge in toy dogs com-
pared to large dogs.
 They can be killed by larger dogs, wild predators, or even
birds of prey.
 Poms in particular need attention to their coat.
 Poms can also bark a lot.
The great points
One reason for the upsurge in toy dog popularity is that it makes
sense to go small! Consider these other reasons:
 Small dogs cost less to board, medicate, and generally
care for.
 They can chew on one kibble like it’s a feast.
 Because less goes in, less comes out, and you aren’t faced
with elephantine poop piles or puddles.
 You can carry a toy dog in a purse-sized bag and take her with
you to places big dogs aren’t allowed.
 Busy schedules, small yards, and maybe a bit of laziness all
make small dogs more appealing when you consider the exer-
cising element.
 Small dogs don’t need to go outside in bad weather to get
some exercise. On snowy days, you can play fetch, tag, or
your own crazy games indoors!
 They don’t push you out of your bed or eat you out of house
and home.
 They don’t drag you down the sidewalk, kill the neighbor’s
cat, or jump through your windows to attack the mail carrier.
When you’ve decided a toy dog is just the ticket, you have so many
breeds — Affenpinschers to Yorkshire Terriers — to choose from.
So why a Pomeranian?

Uniqueness
Poms have their own way of standing out among the toy dogs:
 Poms are among the smallest of all the toy breeds.
 They’re among the more energetic and adventurous of toys.
 They enjoy meeting challenges and can succeed at many dog
sports.
 Poms love to play, but they also enjoy cuddling.
Color varieties
Poms come in one of the widest varieties of colors of any breed:
white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan,
brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and combinations of these colors
and patterns.
The earliest Poms were white or sometimes black and white or
solid black. When the red-sable Marco came on the scene (see the
sidebar “The Pomeranian genealogy” for more on this guy), he
aroused interest in other colors.
In the early 1900s, an orange English Champion named Mars came
to America and created not only a sensation but also a demand for
more orange! By the 1930s, Poms were being shown in a wide vari-
ety of colors, with blacks enjoying popularity. In the 1960s, black
and tans, formerly unacceptable, were deemed acceptable by the
Pomeranian standard. Since then, black and tans have become
some of the top-winning Poms in the country. In 1996, brindle was
finally recognized as an acceptable color.

S
o, you’ve decided a Pomeranian is for you. Just as important,
you think this is the right time and you have the right place for
a Pom. You’re ready to zip out and pick up the first cute one you
see. Whoa — hold on there! Even though you’re tempted to grab
the classifieds, run down to the pet shop, or log onto an online pet
site, you have other questions to consider.
In particular, you need to decide exactly what you want in a Pom.
So in this chapter I lay out the preliminary options you need to
consider, such as gender, age, quality, and quantity. I also offer
pros and cons, recommendations, and even guidance on the cost
of your new Pom friend.
I promise it’s almost time for you to go out and get the Pom of your
dreams. But sit tight — you get to that part in Chapter 4.
Before you begin your hunt, you also need to know what source
will be best. Not all Pom sources are equal, so I provide a little cau-
tion to help you find that perfect Pom. In this chapter I give you a
close-up look at the best places for Pom shopping as well as the
places to avoid. I also show you how to carefully size up breeders
and other sources, and I give tips on adopting abandoned Poms.

Boy or Girl? Choosing the 
Right Gender for You
How do you know whether to buy all your new puppy items in pink
or blue until you decide boy or girl? How do you know whether to
call your new puppy toys baby dolls or action figures? Of course,
the Pom or Poms you choose don’t really care about such human
distinctions — they just want you to love and take care of them.
However, to ensure that you’ll provide the right care, you do want
to understand the different gender needs and challenges.
Whether you choose male or female is primarily a matter of pref-
erence. Gender doesn’t indicate personality even though some
people consider males to be more loving and females to be a little
smarter. But these are broad generalizations; you can easily end
up with a cuddle-loving female or a smart-as-a-whip male. And
although females tend to be a little smaller, the difference is some-
where between tiny and teensy. Unless competing for the world’s
smallest dog is your goal, size isn’t a big consideration when
choosing your Pom’s gender. A bigger concern is a Pom in heat.
The main points to consider? Females come into season for about
three weeks twice a year; males tend to lift their legs and mark
in the house. But if you plan to have your dog neutered, you won’t
have to worry about these problems. Spaying involves removal of
the uterus and ovaries. Although humans who undergo such sur-
geries take a long time to recuperate, dogs, especially young ones,
recover within a couple of days. Castration, on the other hand,
involves removal of the testicles.
In addition to the bloody discharge and wanderlust that are com-
monly associated with a female dog in heat, a female dog that
hasn’t been spayed will shed her coat a month or two after her
season. Your once-beautiful puffball becomes a scrawny little rat
for a bit because, like all unspayed females, she has hormones
raging through her body. Note: A female Pom will lose her coat
whether she whelps (gives birth) or is just in heat.
There’s nothing you can do but pull out the vacuum (for the rug,
not the dog!) and know that her hair will look as pretty as ever in a
couple of months. But if you are trying to keep her looking pretty
for a special event in just a week or two and she hasn’t started
shedding too much, the best advice is to not wash her. Washing,
especially in warm water, loosens the hair follicles. By the time you
dry and brush her, you may find half her hair in your brush!

Age Matters: Choosing Your Match
As long as your Pom is past the age of consent (at least 8 weeks of
age), does it really matter how old he is when you bring him home
to meet the family? Maybe not as much as you think. I touch on
some pros and cons of older versus younger Poms in this section,
but don’t let age alone deter you.
The benefits and drawbacks 
of maturity
Most people think puppy when they think about getting a new dog,
but adult Poms offer many advantages over puppies. If you work
outside the home, have children, or live in an otherwise hectic
household, consider an adult dog. For additional info and even
more reasons to adopt a senior, check Senior Dogs For Dummies by
Susan McCullough (Wiley).
Many breeders have adult dogs available that may be retired
breeding dogs or show dogs that never quite turned into champi-
onship material. Be forewarned: They’re still oh-so-capable of 
winning your heart!
Rescue groups also have adults available. In fact, always consider a
rescue when considering a new adult dog. (See the end of this
chapter and Chapter 4 for more information on rescued Poms.)
If you’re choosing an adult Pom, what you see is what you get —
no need trying to predict what his adult personality’s going to be.
Of course he may be a little shy at first (more so than a puppy),
but as long as he’s not hiding and growling, that reaction is normal.
He also has more sense than puppies and knows enough to wonder
why this stranger (you!) is so interested in him. Will he take a treat
from you? That’s a sign that he’s not really upset. If he’s still
uneasy, ask the breeder whether you all can go to some neutral ter-
ritory. Some dogs are more apprehensive when a stranger invades
their home.
Consider these other benefits and concerns of caring for an
adult Pom:
 Affection: Some people are concerned that an adult dog won’t
form the attachment to you that a puppy would. Fear not —
Pomeranians form bonds very quickly. Within a short period,
your adult Pomeranian will feel like she’s owned you all her life.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 33

If the dog’s really shy or aggressive, though, she needs a more
experienced owner. You don’t do yourself or the dog any favors
by taking on a challenge that you don’t know how to manage.
 Behavior: Mature Poms are often already housetrained, but
whether they catch on depends on how they’ve been living. If
they’ve been in a kennel, they’re usually easier to housetrain
than if they’ve been running loose in the house untrained.
Regardless, they’re generally past their destructive chewing
stage, although a few errant chews may still happen. Senior
Poms don’t need to be fed every few hours or walked every
few minutes, and they even know a cool trick or two.
 Habits: Of course, older dogs may still have bad habits like
using the bathroom where they want, barking at shadows, or
ignoring your calls. They may have come from bad situations
such as puppy mills or abusive homes, where they received
bad training (or none at all). For these reasons, find out as
much as you can about an older dog’s background before you
bring her home. Taking on more than you can handle isn’t fair
to either of you.
 Health: How is his health? The older the dog, the more likely
health problems are to show up. As your last step, have a vet-
erinarian examine him. If the dog has health problems, the
veterinarian may be able to advise you as to whether the
problems will worsen.
And remember, nobody’s perfect! He’s probably wondering about
your temperament, too.
The joys and trials of youth
Ah, glorious youth! The age where the eyes sparkle, the teeth gnaw,
and the rear end leaks like a sieve. Wait a minute — tell me again
why everyone wants a puppy? One reason is obvious — Pom pup-
pies are just so darn cute. Period.
Puppies have a couple of benefits, though, that pack a serious
punch:
 They learn to do things your way. Simply put, it’s a lot easier
convincing your new dog that your way is the right way with-
out her pointing out, “That’s not how they did it where I used
to live!”
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
34

 You can train your dog to do special tasks or live in special
circumstances. You may have a special job planned for your
Pom (like being a therapy dog) or simply special requirements
(like living with cats or other pets). Exposing her to any spe-
cial circumstances early in life helps her take them in stride
later on.
Deciding Whether Two Poms 
Are Better Than One
Poms are social animals, which makes them such great compan-
ions. Without another dog in the house, your Pom looks to you to
be her buddy. But when you’re not home, who does she have for
company?
Give some strong thought to two Poms if you live alone and work
out of the house (or travel a lot) and you have no other pets.
You don’t need to worry about competing with your Poms for their
affection because they have plenty of love to go around. They can
thoroughly enjoy each other when you’re gone and be happy to
fully enjoy you when you’re home. You have twice the fun, twice
the cuddling, and twice the floorshow. Watching two Poms at play
is better than any television show ever made. Best of all, two pup-
pies can comfort or entertain each other when you’re trying to get
some sleep at night!
Although two dogs may become especially attached to one
another (making you feel a tad neglected), you can easily remedy
the situation by separating them and focusing your attention on
each, one at a time. Make this time special by training, or playing a
game, or taking them for a car ride, one playmate at a time.
If you decide to get two pups, you’ll find that opposite sexes tend
to get along the best. Note: That suggestion is assuming you plan
to have them spayed and neutered. Otherwise, opposites become
too attractive and it’s a mistake. Besides, most good breeders
don’t sell what may appear to be a breeding pair of pet-quality pup-
pies (see the following section for more about this term) unless
you agree to early spaying and neutering. Responsible breeders
don’t want you rushing off to breed puppies, whether irresponsibly
or naively.
What about more than two dogs? My answer to that question is to
consider how many hands you have and succumb to my advice
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 35

that two is pushing it at the start. One day, you may be able to
handle three Poms. But take it from somebody (me) who has had
every number of dogs, from 1 to 13, at a time: After three, it only
gets harder!
Considering Your Goals: What
Pom Type Would You Like?
The term quality isn’t necessarily about how good a dog is; it’s
more about his type. Poms have three qualities: pet (also called
companion), show, and breeding. Although pet is the lowest quality
and breeding is the highest, the Pom that’s best for you will always
be top quality in your eyes!
Dogs from hobby breeders are generally graded as either show or
pet quality. The third type, breeding quality, can’t be determined
until the dog is an adult.
The higher quality you demand, the longer your search will take. A
couple of months is a reasonable time in which to find a pet-quality
Pom, but plan to wait a year or so for show quality. Finding a true
breeding-quality Pom may take a few years.
Pet (or companion) quality
A pet-quality dog has a trait that prevents him from winning in the
conformation show ring. The trait can be major (like being way too
big or having very little coat), or it can be minor (like having toes
that point out or the wrong-shaped ears). A common problem in
male Poms is the failure of one or both testicles to completely
descend into the scrotum.
A pet-quality dog is still in good health and has a good tempera-
ment. Being a pet or companion is the most important role any
Pom can assume, so it’s the very best quality for most people.
Good breeders usually sell pet-quality puppies with the require-
ment that that they be spayed or neutered or that they be regis-
tered with AKC limited registration (see Chapter 4). If your dog
does turn out to be higher quality than initially guessed, only the
breeder can change the limited registration to full registration.
Of course, no one can un-spay or un-neuter the dog! Regardless,
spayed, neutered, or limited-registered dogs can compete in every
other venue of competition except conformation showing.

36

Show quality
Show-quality dogs, like pet-quality dogs, must be in good health
and have good temperaments. In addition, to have a reasonable
expectation of becoming champions, they must portray the quali-
ties of the breed standard.
Expect to pay considerably more for a show-quality dog than a pet-
quality dog. Note: A breeder who doesn’t show his own dogs is
unlikely to produce show-quality Pomeranians. At least one parent
should bear an American Kennel Club (AKC) Champion (CH) title
in front of its name, and the remainder of the pedigree should be
peppered with champions.
If you want a show-quality dog, your wait will be significantly
longer than if you want a companion-quality dog. And the more
you demand in terms of quality and specifics, the longer you can
expect to wait for that perfect puppy. At the very least, expect to
wait a couple of months. The reason for this wait is twofold:
 So many factors can change with age. If you really have your
heart set on a show-quality puppy, you may need to buy an
older puppy (at a higher price) that has greater assurance of
turning out as planned.
 Poms have small litters (two to four puppies) and only a small
percentage of those litters may be show quality.
If you decide to get a show-quality dog, keep these points in mind:
 Flaws may emerge at a later age. Maybe a puppy keeps on
growing and growing or the coat falls out. Hey, nobody’s per-
fect. Dog shows are fun, but they make up only a miniscule
part of the time you share with a dog. Don’t let it bother you,
and try competing in one of the many other areas open to you
and your Pom.
 Be fair to the breeder. If you buy a show-quality dog, plan to
show it. Hobby breeders work hard to produce these show-
quality puppies. Their payback isn’t the purchase price but
the thrill of seeing their protégés win in the show ring, espe-
cially for a novice owner. Promising to show their future star
and then hiding him from the world is not good form.
 You need to earn the breeder’s trust. If you’ve never shown a
dog before, most breeders will be hesitant about entrusting
you with a top show-quality puppy. A good way to earn their
trust and respect is to earn an obedience title with another
dog, perhaps by first buying a companion-quality puppy.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 37

Breeding quality
Breeding-quality dogs come from impeccable backgrounds and are
usually exemplary show dogs. A few may have a fault that prevents
them from shining in the ring (such as a crooked ear or a size that’s
out of the standard), but they possess other merits that more than
make up for it. Above all, these dogs are free of serious genetic dis-
ease. Don’t expect a good breeder to sell you a breeding-quality dog
as your first Pom. You’ll need to prove yourself by competing with
your current Pom and by not rushing out to breed any dog you
happen to own.
If a breeder tries to tell you a tiny puppy is breeding quality, the
breeder probably has little idea of what breeding quality really
means (except the ability to produce puppies). A show-quality
dog is difficult to identify as a puppy; a breeding-quality dog is
impossible.
Perusing Pedigrees
A registered dog comes with a pedigree, a story of who begat who
that can be traced back to the first Poms in this country. Most
pedigrees only show you who’s who for the last three to four gen-
erations. On the registration paper, your puppy’s litter is on the
left-hand side. From there the pedigree works back, generation by
generation, moving left to right, with the sire (the male) always
above the name of his progeny, and the dam (the female) always
below.

38
Early spay-neuter
Many adoption groups and some breeders sterilize puppies before they’re adopted,
even if that means as early as 8 weeks of age. They take special precautions (min-
imizing surgical time, keeping the puppy warm, withholding food for as short a time
as possible, and being extremely careful with their comparatively delicate tissues)
to avoid hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and excessive bleeding in the pup.
Given these precautions, puppies sterilized at early ages have shorter recovery
times and fewer complications than pups sterilized later. Some limited information
suggests that females spayed at a young age have a higher incidence of urinary
incontinence, but that tends to be more of a problem in large breeds.

If you want a top-quality dog, look for titles in the pedigree. For
example, the letters CH stand for champion and designate a dog
that has won based on the breed standard. The letters CD, CDX,
and UD (Companion Dog, Companion Dog Excellent, and Utility
Dog) or RN, RA, and RX (Rally Novice, Advanced, and Excellent)
after a dog’s name are various obedience titles. They signify dogs
that have demonstrated minding skills in obedience trials.
If you don’t plan to compete with your dog (and most people
don’t), these titles still demonstrate a breeder’s sincerity in using
the best dogs and her intent to do more with her dogs than just
breed them. Of greater importance are health clearances. Note:
Titles and clearances on dogs farther back than the grandparents
aren’t significant.
Look especially for whether the litter is inbred (the litter has the
same dog appearing behind both the sire and the dam). Fewer
generations between that dog and the litter generally mean a
more-inbred litter. See Figure 3-1 for a sample pedigree of an inbred
dog — this is what you don’t want to see.
Although inbreeding is a tool used by many breeders, the average
pet owner gains nothing by having an inbred dog. Inbreeding
increases the chance of two recessive genes appearing in a
puppy, increasing the chance of certain recessively inherited
health problems such as progressive retinal atrophy or a generally
weaker immune system.

Evaluating Pom Sources
Finding a Pomeranian isn’t hard. Your challenge is to find one that
will live a long and healthy life. So you want to find a breeder who’s
careful about the dogs she breeds, the way she raises them, and
the homes she sends them to. The problem is that such breeders
don’t always make themselves easy to find because they have a
long waiting list of good homes.
How do you know when someone’s a good breeder? Two steps:
First, understand the various sources for dogs, and second, know
how to evaluate the quality of each source. The primary sources
for Poms are
 Pet stores (supplied by commercial breeders)
 Backyard breeders (found usually through newspaper ads)
 Serious breeders (also known as hobby breeders)
 Rescue groups and shelters
Pet stores and commercial breeders
Pomeranians, with their stuffed-teddy-bear looks, are popular pet-
store puppies. They appeal to impulse buyers who take one look
and whip out their credit card. In contrast to pet stores that tend
to rely on impulse buyers, good breeders most likely turn away
impulse shoppers because they want to ensure a good fit between
owner and dog.
Some pet stores rely on uninformed buyers who don’t know:
 Puppies are hauled across country to the stores by the
truckload.
 These pups come from large, commercial-breeding operations
that often keep hundreds of dogs in cramped cages, sometimes
in squalid conditions.
 This breeding stock is bought and sold at auctions, with low
price usually being the deciding factor.
 Poor temperaments, poor resemblance to the breed, poor
structure, and poor health don’t matter; it’s all about profit.
Pet-store puppies are often raised in a wire-floored cage, some-
times stacked on top of one another. In the worst situations, urine
and feces from pups on top fall down on puppies below, who then
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
40

grow up without the normal canine disgust for stepping in their
own waste. This scenario can make housetraining a potential night-
mare because the pups never experience doing their business out-
side on the grass. Also, socialization, which is so vital for puppies,
is absent or minimal. Sadly, a pet-store Pom, though surely cute, is
probably no bargain, especially with the large retail-price markups
(more on pricing in Chapter 4).
Not every commercial breeder has such bad conditions. Some of
these breeders realize that the best way to raise salable puppies is
to produce puppies under healthy circumstances. The problem is
that you can’t tell which puppies come from which type of com-
mercial breeder after the pups are in the pet store.
Newspaper ads and 
backyard breeders
Another place to find a Pomeranian puppy is in the newspaper’s
classified section. These ads are often placed by people referred to
as backyard breeders.
A backyard breeder may be operating a small-scale puppy mill. In
other words:
 He may keep dogs of different breeds, selling the puppies to
make extra money.
 He puts up roadside signs advertising puppies and even sells
puppies at flea markets.
 He keeps the dogs in poor conditions, seldom has their health
tested, and provides minimal socialization for the dogs.
Ferreting out a bad-news backyard breeder is easy: Ask whether
he’ll have other litters coming any time soon. If he replies, “Sure,
what breed would you like?” tell him “None.”
Sometimes a backyard breeder is a family that decides to breed a
litter from their pet Pomeranian. And they may have a variety of
reasons: They want their children to experience the miracle of
birth; they want to add a new Pom that looks like the one they
have; or they want to see whether they can make a few dollars.
Although they’re possibly a bit naïve about the whole breeding
process, their intentions are good. As Pom owners, they care about
the pups and will care about you. The puppies may be well social-
ized, but their parents may not have been health tested.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 41

A family backyard breeder may not be the ideal place to buy a
puppy, but they are better than pet stores or small-scale puppy
mills. This is definitely a situation where you as the buyer must
beware and ask lots of questions.
Hobby breeders who are 
really serious
For some Pom lovers, breeding healthy, high-quality Pomeranians
is an obsession. They compete in conformation shows or perform-
ance events and virtually center their lives on their dogs. These
serious breeders are usually referred to as hobby breeders —
although their dedication surpasses that of most hobbies. Many
people are under the false impression that breeders breed to make
money. But hobby and serious breeders don’t. It’s not a business;
it’s a love affair. And almost invariably, they spend much more
money on their dogs than they can ever hope to recoup
If you want a high-quality Pomeranian, serious hobby breeders
are your best source. However, they’re also more difficult to find,
so a little sleuthing may be needed. Here are good sources for
information:
 National Clubs: The best place to start is the American
Pomeranian Club national breeder referral list (go to
www.americanpomeranianclub.org and click on APC Info
and then Member Roster). You can find contact information
for local members who may be breeders or who can direct
you to breeders.
You can also contact the club’s national breeder referral
person by clicking on APC Info and then Breeder Referral Info.
The breeder referral person often knows who has litters in
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
42
Beware the claims of rare
If a breeder claims a dog is rare because of color, size, or an unusual trait, this state-
ment should raise a caution flag. Some colors are more common than others, but no
Pom color is rare, and certain colors don’t make a dog more valuable.
The same is true of size. The Pomeranian standard specifies the average weight to
be 3 to 7 pounds (4 to 6 pounds for show dogs). Within this range, one size is as good
as another. Smaller sizes can be more difficult to keep healthy, so aim for the top of
the standard.

your area or who has litters of various colors if you have a
preference. Most, but not all, hobby breeders are members of
the national breed club.
Joining the club means agreeing to a code of ethics that covers
integrity in breeding. Of course, signing the code doesn’t guar-
antee people will follow it any more than joining the club makes
them magically good breeders. But it’s a start.
 Regional Clubs: In addition to the national club, many
regional Pomeranian clubs exist. (The national site can refer
you to a regional club in your area; click on APC Info and then
Regional Clubs.) Getting to know local Pomeranian breeders is
one of the best ways to meet their dogs in person and to let
the breeders know what a good home you have for one of
their puppies.
 Dog Shows: Another way to meet breeders is by attending a
local dog show. You can find upcoming shows at the American
Kennel Club’s Web page for upcoming events at www.akc.
org/events/search/ or check out www.infodog.com. The
latter site also includes the specific times Pomeranians are
shown at particular shows.
Although Pomeranian exhibitors are usually happy to talk to
you, the one time they’d rather not chat is right before they
go in the ring. Make arrangements to talk to them after judg-
ing is over.
 Dog-Specific Magazines: Several sources are available.
• A Pomeranian magazine like The Pom Reader or a maga-
zine aimed at toy breeds like Top Notch Toys are excellent
places to find top breeders. Go to www.dmcg.com for
more information.
• All-breed dog magazines like Dog World (www.animal
channel.com) also contain advertisements from hobby
breeders.
 Veterinarians: Local veterinarians can often be a good source.
After all, they know breeders, so they know which breeders
take good care of their dogs!
 Internet: You can join one of the many Pomeranian discussion
lists on the Internet. Start your search at www.yahoogrops.
com and look for breeders there, but you must evaluate these
breeders carefully.
The next section equips you to separate the wheat from the chaff
when it comes to serious Pom breeders.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 43

Finding Good Breeders
Okay, so it’s time to grill the breeder! Not really, of course. You want
to listen carefully as he shares his enthusiasm for his dogs. In fact,
you’re establishing a relationship, not just buying a dog. Besides
being your best source for a puppy with good health, good tempera-
ment, and good looks, a good breeder also becomes your mentor
and friend. For example:
 You can always ask questions, share anecdotes, and find help
at a moment’s notice.
 You find that you’re part of an extended family of puppy
owners, and you can keep up with littermates throughout
their lives.
 If circumstances arise that force you to surrender your dog, a
good breeder is there to make sure your dog’s taken care of.
The following series of questions (and the right answers) can help
you determine the good breeders from the bad ones:
 Can I visit in person? Good breeders may actually require
that you visit in person so they can meet you and see how you
interact with the dogs. The breeder has no valid reason for
not allowing you to visit except if you have a sick dog at
home. If they say “No” to a visit, say “Good-bye,” hang up, and
dial the next number on your list.
 Do you specialize in Pomeranians? Dealing with one breed
is so challenging that serious breeders stick with the breed
they’re passionate about. Unless she’s building an ark, a
breeder who has two of everything (multiple breeds) is more
likely a small-scale puppy mill. (Check back to “Newspaper
ads and backyard breeders” for more on this breed of
breeder.)
 Do you always have puppies available? Breeders who always
have puppies may not be able to give each litter the attention
it needs. You want your puppy to experience the breeder’s
home, not just his kennel or garage. However, if the breeder
has years of experience, a great deal of success, the proper
facilities, and good help to make sure the dogs are properly
cared for and socialized, then the constant breeding may not
be an issue.
 Are the dogs registered with the AKC or United Kennel Club
(UKC)? A good breeder registers her dogs. Although other
registries exist, only the AKC and the UKC are considered
reputable.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
44

 What sort of health concerns do you screen for? If they
claim Pomeranians have no such concerns, you know you’re
dealing with the wrong people. If they say Poms need no
health screening, walk away. If they say they’ve had a couple
of problems, keep listening. No line is completely free of
health problems, and you may have just met an honest
breeder.
But at the same time, be careful. You may have just met a
really stupid breeder who doesn’t know any better. See
Chapter 4 for a list of tests to look for.
 Do you participate with your dogs in conformation shows,
agility trials, obedience trials, or therapy work? Have the dogs
earned any titles? Participation indicates an above-average
commitment to the breed. Titles indicate an above-average
dedication to the breed plus better-than-average quality of the
dogs (Refer back to “Considering Your Goals: What Pom Type
Would You Like?” for definitions of quality.)
 Can I see the pedigree? The pedigree should always be avail-
able for inspection. If it’s not, this is not a reputable breeder.
 What sort of paperwork comes with the puppy? Several
kinds of paper should be available:
• You can expect a medical history, a pedigree, and a reg-
istration slip.
• A good breeder also includes written care instructions, a
contract, and a warranty.
No breeder can guarantee everything, but he should
warrantee the puppy’s health for the first week and per-
haps offer a partial refund in the event of certain heredi-
tary diseases.
A contract should cover a plan for the puppy if you can’t
keep her. For example, a good breeder stipulates that
you must return the puppy to the breeder to prevent the
puppy ending up in a shelter or being passed from person
to person. Note: In most cases the breeder does not give
a refund for a returned puppy that’s grown up because
placing an adult dog is usually difficult.
 Do you have any breeding requirements? Some breeders
require you to breed your dog and then share the litter with
them or to provide free stud service. This is never a good
idea. You may wish to spay or neuter your dog, and you don’t
want to be obligated to breed.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 45

 Do you require that the puppy be spayed or neutered? This
is not an issue about competition. Good breeders often require
you to spay or neuter your dog because they’re concerned
about the future of the puppy and the breed. The dog they
sold you is probably companion quality, which means she’s a
wonderful dog but not show or breeding quality; as such, she
shouldn’t be bred.
Good breeders are also concerned about your taking the
plunge into breeding. Breeding responsibly and knowledgably
isn’t something you can just jump right into, and you may end
up being sorry you ever had such a foolish idea.
An alternative to required spay-neuter is AKC limited registra-
tion, which means that if you breed your dog, her offspring
can’t be AKC Registered.
 When can I take a new Pom puppy home? The answer to this
question is an opportunity to evaluate the breeder. Breeders
out for a buck are eager to get a puppy off their feed bill as
soon as possible. Backyard breeders who don’t know any
better may also let you take home your puppy whenever you
want. No puppy of any breed should leave its breeder before
8 weeks of age. For more info on when the pup can leave the
breeder, see Chapter 4.
 How much do puppies cost? Good breeders charge neither
bargain-basement prices nor exorbitantly high prices in com-
parison to other breeders. Although prices vary by region of
the country, a good companion-quality Pomeranian from a
reputable breeder should cost $300 to $900. See Chapter 4 for
more details on price.
 Do you have any previous puppy buyers I can talk to? Good
breeders keep in touch with their puppy buyers. If they claim
not to have any contact information, that’s a bad sign. Good
breeders are also proud of their puppies and know their pup-
pies’ owners are proud, too. For privacy reasons, they may
ask that the former buyers contact you rather than vice versa.
But if they flat out say “No,” walk away.
As you check out serious breeders, you may quickly discover that
they’re also evaluating you! In fact, if you don’t feel they’re curious
about you as a potential pet owner, it can be a red flag. For exam-
ple, when a breeder only seems concerned about your check clear-
ing, you may want to move on to another breeder.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
46

Good breeders make sure their puppies go where they’ll be loved
for a lifetime. For that reason, the breeder usually checks out the
following:
 They ask about your experience with dogs and pets in general
and toy dogs in particular.
 They ask about your home and family and where you plan to
keep the dog.
 They’re very upfront with you about expenses, exercise, train-
ing, grooming, health care, and safety issues.
 They often require that you neuter or spay your dog, and may
ask you to wait for several months for a litter. During this
cooling off period, they’re making sure you’re not just impulse
buying.
Rescuing Abandoned Poms
It’s hard to believe, but many Poms are out there needing a secure
home and a family to love them. Reasons for abandonment abound,
but most often it’s just the wrong home for the right dog. Maybe an
owner simply got tired of the Pom, couldn’t deal with the barking,
or had life changes that left him unable to care for a dog. Poms get
abandoned just like other dogs.
Whether they had a loving owner or not, rescued Poms are often
apprehensive, confused, and even frightened. They may cling to
their foster owners or new families, afraid that they’ll lose these
recent saviors. But with time, love, training, and stability, these
Poms gradually adapt to their new circumstances and become
exceptional family companions.
You may fear that adopting a rescued Pom means taking on some-
body else’s problems or that rescued dogs come with emotional
baggage. These occurrences are rare. In fact, the top obedience
Pomeranian of all time was rescued at 8 years of age from an
animal shelter.
A rescued Pomeranian is the deal of a lifetime but certainly not
free. Because rescue groups realize that people tend to value pets
that they’ve invested in and because these groups need to recoup
their expenses to continue the services, they charge a reasonable
fee. Expect to pay about $200 or so for a Pom from a rescue group.
Chapter 3: In Search of Your Soul Mate 47

Here are ways you can find Poms in need of homes through rescue
groups or shelters:
 The American Pomeranian Club: The club maintains a
national rescue network that you can access through their
Web site at www.americanpomeranianclub.org. Click on
APC Info and then Rescue. The Rescue link also lists local
rescue contacts around the country.
 Petfinder: This group maintains a national database of dogs
of all breeds in shelters. Go to www.petfinder.com and
search by Pomeranian.
You can also narrow your search to just local shelters. Dogs
from shelters tend to cost a little less than dogs from breed
rescue groups, but they often don’t go through as much
screening or preparation.
 Pomeranian Club of Canada Rescue (Canada): Access this
group through their Web site at www.toyrificpoms.com/
pomrescue/index.htm. This group focuses on Poms in
Canada.
 Pomeranian and Small Breed Rescue (Canada): You can
reach this group at www.psbrescue.com.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
48
To the rescue!
Even if you can’t take on the long-term responsibility of a dog, you can do your part
for rescue. Rescue groups always need supplies, money, and volunteers.
Volunteers can help rescue, bathe, groom, socialize, train, and transport Pomeranians.
Most of all, volunteers can help foster by providing a temporary home while a Pom
awaits a forever home.

S
o far, so good. You’ve found a good breeder (or two or three),
seen a bevy of Poms of all ages up close and personal, and
you’re still certain you want a Pomeranian. Terrific! (If you haven’t
read Chapter 3, it’s loaded with ideas for getting to this point.) But
as visions of all those bouncing Pomeranian puffballs dance in
your head, how do you narrow the choice to the one (or two) that
will be coming home with you?
Funny you should ask. This chapter eases you through all those
steps — from setting eyes on your dream Pom to signing on the
dotted line. I give you background info on fair prices, interactions
with the breeder and her pups, and the all-important health ques-
tions. The last few sections cover the red tape: payments, paper-
work, and registration. I also include the info you need to feel
comfortable dealing with an alternative source — rescue programs
and shelters. (Please read Chapter 3 for an introduction to these
two resources.) At last, the best part is about to begin!

Knowing the Right Price: 
A Quick Guide
Talking money and filling out papers isn’t nearly as much fun as
playing with your new Pom, but it’s a necessary part of buying a
purebred Pomeranian. A good breeder knows all the procedures,
but you’re wise to have some knowledge of the basics as well.
When’s the right time to ask about price? That’s difficult to say. If
you make price the first question on your list, the breeder may get
the impression you’re just out for a bargain puppy — a big turnoff
for good breeders looking for good homes. On the other hand, talk-
ing for hours or making multiple visits only to discover the puppy
is out of your price range sounds pretty silly.
The best time to bring the subject up is before you visit but after
the breeder tells you briefly about the puppies — and perhaps
after you tell the breeder about yourself. Be upfront; you know
good-quality Poms can be costly, so you want to make sure you
can afford one from this breeder before taking up any more of his
time — or yours.
Although I can’t tell you specifically how much you’ll pay for a
Pom, I can give you an idea of what factors affect the price:
 Region of the country where you live (or buy your Pom
from): More urban and affluent areas charge more. (No
shocker there!)
 Age of puppy: Younger puppies tend to bring more than older
puppies or adults that may not be considered as cute unless,
of course, the older puppy is show quality (See Chapter 3).
Then it goes for quite a bit more than the others because its
show prospects are more certain; see the next bullet.
 Pedigree and show quality: Puppies from parents with titles
or health testing (veterinary tests to show they are clear of
various hereditary health problems — see Chapter 11) gener-
ally cost more.
A show-prospect puppy may range from $900 to $1,500. An
older puppy that is definitely show quality ranges from
$1,500 on up.
 Who you buy your puppy from: Usually puppies from pet
stores cost the most, followed by hobby breeders, then back-
yard breeders. (Refer to Chapter 3 for info on all these Pom
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
50

terms.) Newspaper ads by backyard breeders in your area can
give you a good idea of low-end prices, and local pet-store
prices represent the high end.
• Pet-store prices range from $1000 to $1,500.
• Breeder prices for a healthy puppy range from $300
to $900.
• Rescue prices range from $100 to $300, with less 
expensive dogs coming from shelters and slightly
more expensive ones coming from rescue groups.
In general, the lower prices are for older dogs or dogs that
require neutering or spaying.
In the long run, the dog from the hobby breeder is the best bargain
because it’s been screened for hereditary health problems and
brought up under healthier conditions. But the rescue dog gives
you the most love for your buck!
If the breeder has a waiting list, she may require you to place a
deposit to save your spot. This step is customary, but be sure to
get a receipt that spells out any agreements (like the sex and
health of the puppy) and guarantees your money back if no pup-
pies become available within a specified time period.
A deposit is also necessary if you’ve selected a puppy before he’s
old enough to go home. Be sure you have some way of identifying
that pup when you go back to pick him up! Take a photo — you’ll
want one anyway. If the puppies all look alike, ask the breeder to
paint some of your puppy’s toenails with some nail polish you’ve
brought along.
Visiting the Breeder
After you’ve narrowed down your choices, you can make a visit to
the breeders on your list.
Most breeders are not large-scale kennels and aren’t set up for visi-
tors to just drop in. Breeders may have a small kennel or raise pup-
pies in their home, and they may work out of the home during the
day. So trying to visit as many breeders as you can just for the fun
of it isn’t a good idea. As much as they love talking Poms, breeders
do need to attend to their dogs and other responsibilities. Narrow
your choice breeders down to just a couple of contenders; then
expand your list only if those don’t seem right.
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 51

In order to prevent your being the Typhoid Mary of the Pom world,
breeders prefer you don’t visit one kennel right after another, and
you certainly shouldn’t stop by the dog shelter on the way. Wash
your hands before you visit the kennel and be prepared to leave
your shoes outside.
Taking a look around
The visit to a kennel allows you to see how the breeder is raising
the puppies, how the other dogs in the household look, and last
but not least, how you get along with the breeder. Be sure to pay
attention to the following:
 Are the facilities clean, with sufficient room for the dogs? A
good breeder doesn’t keep his dogs in cramped, dirty cages.
This applies to every dog on the property, not just the puppies.
 Do the puppies have time outside and access to grass?
Puppies raised entirely inside may imprint (learn to prefer)
the surface they’re forced to relieve themselves on, making
housetraining difficult.
 Do the puppies have access to people? Puppies need some
time in the house so they get plenty of socialization. If they’re
in a separate kennel, ask whether they get to come in the
house or how the breeder socializes them.
 Are all the dogs friendly and healthy looking? They don’t
have to love you, but you don’t want them snarling at you
either. Are their coats well groomed?
When it comes to appearance and demeanor, make allowances for
any old dogs and for the dam, whose coat has probably fallen out
after whelping (giving birth). Ask to see pictures of her before she
had puppies. She may not be thrilled with you around her puppies,
but she should be comfortable with the breeder. Note: Don’t
expect to see the sire, which may live elsewhere.
Getting personal: Specific
questions to ask
When you’re on the premises and looking at the pups, here are a
few more questions to bring up:
 What was the purpose for breeding this litter? Good breed-
ers mate specific dogs to bring out the best qualities of both,
and they’re delighted to explain their reasoning. They can
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
52

point to the good health of the parents, their exemplary tem-
peraments, or their conformity to the breed standard. If the
breeder is evasive or the answer sounds off, then beware.
 Can I see photos of both parents and other relatives? Good
breeders may have you regretting you asked this question as
they proudly pull out photo album after album of Trixie’s
ancestors. Bad breeders — Camera? Photos? Huh?
 How do the parents compare to the Pomeranian breed stan-
dard? That is, can the breeder point to a dog and say this one
has the correct foxlike expression, but her ears are a little too
large and her skull is a little too domed? A breeder who says
her dogs are perfect or advises you to ignore the standard is
no longer a good candidate.
 How soon can I take my puppy home? No puppy of any breed
should leave its breeder before 8 weeks of age. Pomeranians,
like many toy puppies, are generally held longer; the breeder
often insists on keeping them until they’re 10 to 12 weeks old.
The Poms’ small size, along with their susceptibility to hypo-
glycemia (see Chapter 8), makes early placement somewhat
risky. In addition, puppies pick up valuable lessons about
being dogs by staying with their littermates and mom. Puppies
separated too early can have problems relating to other dogs
for the rest of their lives.
The Big Test: Interacting
with Potential Pups
After you’ve selected and visited your breeder (see the previous
section), he may want to choose a puppy just for you based on
your previous discussions. (The breeder knows the puppies better
than you possibly can during your short visit, and a good breeder
tries to match puppy to person based on personality.) But if you
have a choice (and even if the breeder has chosen one for you),
you still need to make sure this is the right puppy for you.
This section gives you helpful hints on setting the stage for this
all-important interaction and carefully selecting the new love of
your life.
Getting the ground rules right
When you’re at the breeders and ready to interact, keep these sug-
gestions in mind as the breeder brings the puppies to you:
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 53

 Sit on the floor with the puppies. This arrangement encour-
ages them to come and see you and allows you to interact
more freely with them. It also eliminates the chance of trip-
ping over, stepping on, or dropping one of them!
 Wait for them to come to you. Make note of which puppies
come up to interact with you by climbing in your lap or play-
ing with your fingers. Put those pups on your yes list. Don’t
chase or grab at the puppies. Nobody likes that.
 Give every available puppy a fair shake. Just because one
isn’t the sex or color you initially had in mind, don’t write it
off. You may lose out on the best dog for you.
If all the puppies look alike, you may get one confused with
another. If you know you’re definitely not interested in some of
them, ask the breeder to take them out of the mix. Or have the
breeder put different-colored ribbons on them or on their collars.
Try to visit the breeder more than once before the puppies are
ready to go. Puppies often act and look very different from one
visit to the next. The breeder may want you to bring your children
just to see how they interact with the dogs. If you bring young chil-
dren, bring another adult to supervise them. Note: If you can’t
keep your children under control for a couple of hours, the
breeder may decide yours is not a safe home for a small puppy.
What if you change your mind? It’s possible you could lose your
deposit unless you have a valid reason. Of course, if the breeder
changes his mind, he is obliged to return any deposit.
Finding love at first sight
Of course, just as with people, a puppy temperament that suits one
person may not be the best for another. If you have a quiet house-
hold and a patient personality, yours may be just the home for that
hesitant puppy; if you’re an adventurer, you may find your match
in the wildest puppy. But for most people, the middle puppy, nei-
ther quietest nor wildest, is the best choice.
As you observe these little Pom prancers at the breeder’s, note
these personality traits:
 Confident: Pom puppies are generally confident. They should
carry their tails high and be eager to interact. Beware any
puppy that hides in a corner, keeps his tail tucked, cringes at
sudden noises, or growls when you approach. This puppy will
need special training and is not for the novice owner.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
54

 Independent: Take each puppy that’s on your yes list into
another room, away from its littermates. The puppy should
take the separation in stride, and you should be able to get
her interest.
While still separated, see whether the puppy tends to follow
you. That bonding is always nice, but don’t discount the
puppy who gets distracted exploring all the new stuff.
Regardless, you don’t want the puppy that huddles on the
ground, too scared to move. He may grow out of it — but not
without a lot of work.
 Playful: Is the puppy interested in toys? Will he fetch? This
quality is important if you like to play or if you have children.
(It can also help you figure out which kinds of toys to buy!)
 Affectionate: Will the puppy allow you to hold her for a few
seconds? Give her a couple of chances. You’re asking a lot of a
pup to pluck her from the middle of playing with her brothers
and sisters and then expect her to snuggle calmly in your lap.
Still can’t decide? Having a hard time saying No to the little puppy
who seeks you out, tumbles into your lap while playing, and
promptly falls asleep? Maybe letting your dog choose you really is
the best approach. The only problem is that you may find yourself
with an entire lap full of Pom pups! If you can’t take two, maybe it’s
time to ask the breeder to make the final choice for you.
Screening for Good Health
Like all popular breeds, Pomeranians have their own set of heredi-
tary health concerns. Small breeds, for example, tend to have 
patellar luxation (knee problems), and Poms develop this problem
more than any other breed. They also tend to have alopecia X, a
coat problem where their hair falls out. No one can guarantee
these conditions will or won’t appear, but puppies from parents
without these problems are less likely to develop them. That’s why
testing the parents for various disorders is important.
Relying on the breeder’s
expertise and integrity
Good breeders are aware of these hereditary problems and do
their best to avoid producing them in new litters. Ask the breeder
whether any of the following health concerns are in a particular
Pom’s ancestry:
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 55

 Alopecia X: This condition is one of the Pom’s most common
breed predispositions. No screening test is available, but ask
the breeder whether it’s common in the line. Because the
condition is more common in males than females, some
researchers believe it’s sex-linked (passed from mothers
to sons).
 Eye conditions: Poms can suffer from entropion (the eyelid
turns in on the eye) and progressive retinal atrophy (the light
receptive cells die, and the dog becomes blind). Neither prob-
lem is especially common in the breed. Screening tests are
available, and you have some assurance if the parents have
been examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist and regis-
tered in the Canine Eye Registration Foundation database.
 Patellar luxation: Also known as slipping kneecaps, this
condition affects a large percentage of Pomeranians — in fact,
a higher percentage than any other breed. Although the mode
of inheritance is unknown, all breeding stock should be
examined.
The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) maintains a
registry (available online) of Poms that have been checked
and recorded with them. Go to their Web site at www.offa.
org, click on Search OFA Records, and then choose
Pomeranian and Patella. Breeders are not required to register
their dogs with the OFA, but they should have a veterinary
report attesting to the condition of their dogs’ knees.
 Patent ductus arteriosus: This is the most common heart
problem seen in puppies and is particularly common in
Pomeranians. Researchers believe it is caused by the inter-
play of several genes. Ideally, the parents, the parents’ sib-
lings, and other relatives should be screened by a veterinary
cardiologist.
Other conditions like tracheal collapse (the windpipe can’t stay
open when breathing) and epilepsy have no screening tests or
clearance registry, but you’re wise to ask whether the litter’s line
has a history of them.
No hereditary line is totally disease free. A breeder may not know
or may not want to tell, but that’s one good reason you take the
time to select a reputable, experienced breeder in the first place.
Checking up on a puppy’s health
Healthy puppies are chipper little nippers. They play hard and
they sleep hard. If they’re awake, they should be bouncy, even if
they’re still pretty clumsy.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
56

None of the puppies in a litter should have signs of potentially con-
tagious diseases. (If one puppy’s sick, you can be sure the rest are
on their way.) Signs of common illnesses that you can check for
yourself include
 Diarrhea or signs of recent diarrhea, such as a reddened or
irritated anus
 Vomiting (excuse the occasional regurgitating that can happen
when playing too hard right after eating or drinking)
 Dehydration, which can indicate a recent bout of diarrhea or
vomiting
Test for hydration by gently picking up a fold of skin and
letting it go. It should snap back into place instead of forming
a tent.
 Repeated sneezing, sniffling, gagging, or coughing
 Extremely runny or gooey eyes
 Snotty nose
 Dirty, smelly ears, or head shaking, which can indicate
ear mites
 Pale gums, which can indicate anemia from heavy parasite
infestation
Healthy gums are bright pink.
 Thin with a potbelly, which often indicates intestinal parasites
 Dirty, crusted, or reddened skin
Now check out the individual puppy you’re interested in:
 Teeth: Are his teeth straight? Do they meet with the front top
teeth just in front of the bottom teeth?
This detail isn’t that important if you don’t want show quality.
However, some puppies’ occlusions (the way the teeth meet)
are so off that the pup may have difficulty eating. Other pup-
pies’ bottom fangs are too narrow and stick into the upper
gums or the roof of the mouth when the puppies close their
mouths. Both of these problems often require expensive
dental work for the puppy to be comfortable.
 Eyes: Check again for irritation. Do the lids fold in on the eye?
That condition may be entropion (see the first bullet list in
this section). Although many puppies grow out of it, the prob-
lem may require surgery if it persists into adulthood.
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 57

 Limbs: Check for signs of limping. Puppies are always throw-
ing themselves around and falling, so some limping may be
excusable. But limping at an early age may also indicate
severe patellar luxation (see the first bullet list in this sec-
tion), which will probably require surgery. If the puppy of
your choice is limping, ask to come back another day and
check on him or request that a veterinarian check him out.
 In males: Check to see whether both testicles are descended
into the scrotum. Okay, this isn’t easy. You probably can’t feel
anything there until at least 8 weeks of age or so. But by that
age, the tiny testes (which may only be the size of a BB)
should be in or almost to the scrotum.
Gently run your hand backward from around the penis and
you should feel the slight lump that is the testicle. Most testi-
cles are completely descended by 10 to 12 weeks of age,
although some late bloomers may take as long as 5 or 6
months. Neutering a dog with undescended testicles is a
more involved surgery than neutering one with normally
descended testicles.
Any purchase should be contingent on getting a clean bill of health
from a veterinarian within 48 hours of taking possession of the
puppy. (Chapter 5 tells you how to find a good vet and schedule
the first appointment, and Chapter 7 gives you a rundown of what
to expect at that appointment.)
Paying for Your Pom and
Handling the Paperwork
When you’ve made your choice, you probably can’t wait to crack
out the cash and start signing the papers to make him all yours!
But this process takes some time, so sit down and try to concen-
trate on paperwork, not puppy play.
Money matters
By this time you and the breeder have reached an understanding
about price. Few breeders accept credit cards, and most prefer
cash or a money order instead of a personal check. Some breeders
accept installment payments, usually keeping their name on the
registration papers until you’ve paid in full.
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
58

Paperwork you receive
When you pay for your Pom, the breeder should give you the
following:
 AKC registration slip
 Bill of sale
 Copy of the pedigree
 Record of the puppy’s medical information
 Any contract or health guarantee
 Contact information in case of future questions
 Care instructions
Other paperwork you can buy
When you buy a registered puppy, the registration is part of the
price. However, the pedigree isn’t necessarily included. Most
breeders include one (and I hope you got to see one before you
made your purchase), but it’s usually typed or handwritten and
not certified. This copy of the pedigree is just fine for almost every
need you will ever have.
However, you can still buy an official certified pedigree from the
AKC. You would need it only on rare occasions, like trying to regis-
ter your dog in a foreign country.
You can also purchase a DNA profile for your dog. Upon request,
the AKC will send you a swab to collect cells from the inner lip of
your dog. Send the swab back in the provided envelope (along with
a small fee). A few months later you’ll receive a certificate suitable
for framing that shows the pattern of several marker genes used in
verifying parentage. The genes don’t tell you whether your dog has
a particular gene-causing disease, but they can identify your dog as
well as any fingerprint . . . or paw print . . . or nose print.
Registering Your New Friend
Most AKC puppies are sold as part of a registered litter, and
because you’ve gone through the trouble to buy a purebred dog,
the next step is to register each pup from that litter. (The breeder
seldom registers the individual dog unless you’ve chosen an older
dog.) Registration costs $20 but goes up by $35 if you take longer
than a year after the litter is registered.
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 59

Include the following information on the registration form, which
the breeder provides (see the bullet list in the previous section):
1. Your name
2. Your address
3. Your dog’s name
Usually you get to select a name for your puppy. But often
the breeder requires that the kennel name (only its first
name usually) be part of the registered name.
Some breeders also use litter identifiers; they request that
you name your puppy starting with a certain letter or
theme. That way other breeders — for example, if you were
to compete with your dog — know that all the puppies
whose names start with a D or with a name of some song-
bird, for example, are littermates.
Registration is a bargain. It comes with a free 60-day trial health-
care policy, a free first visit with a participating veterinarian, a
puppy-care brochure, e-mail certificates for deals at dog.com, and
of course, a registration certificate. Registration also enables your
dog to participate in AKC events.
Transactions of a Different Bird:
Adopting from Rescues or Shelters
Rescued Poms have had their hearts broken, and they need
secure, permanent homes where it won’t happen again. That’s one
reason rescue groups are picky about where these dogs go. They
don’t want you adopting a dog only to have it or its offspring turn
up in the shelter again.
In contrast with shelters that may not have the staff to get to know
every dog individually, rescue groups often send their Poms to live
in foster homes while they’re awaiting forever homes. This extra
attention gives the rescue group an advantage over shelters when
matching you with the right Pom. Rescue groups tend to incur
more expenses per dog on average because these groups are more
likely to save dogs that need medical attention. Expect to pay a
slightly higher adoption fee compared to a shelter.
Rescue groups do most of their initial screening and matching
through the internet or by phone, whereas shelters tend to rely
more on personal visits. If you visit a Pom at a shelter, remember
these tips:
Part I: Pomeranians: What’s Not to Love? 
60

 Ask whether you can take her outside or to a quiet room,
away from barking dogs.
 Plan to spend a long time getting to know her.
 Remember, she’s probably a little shellshocked from being in
the shelter situation. Her full personality will take a while to
blossom after she comes home with you.
Most rescue groups begin the adoption process by having prospec-
tive owners complete an application. Applicants may be asked to
provide veterinary references, and the rescue group or shelter may
schedule a phone interview or in-home visit. Although this process
may seem invasive, it is intended to ensure the best match of Pom,
owner, and circumstance. Here’s what you can expect:
 Expect to provide proof of home ownership or permission
from your landlord to have a dog.
 Expect to wait for the dog to be neutered or spayed; this is
often done only after the dog has found a home.
 Expect to pay a reasonable fee that covers the dog’s surgery,
vaccinations, and board. Your adoption fee helps the shelter
or rescue group recoup their expenses and be ready to help
the next dog in need.
 Expect to be asked the following questions:
• What happened to your last dog?
• Do you have experience with small dogs?
• Who will take care of the dog?
• How often are you home?
You should ask questions, too, which will help you get to know
a dog:
 Does this dog have any medical or behavioral problems?
 Why was she given up for adoption?
Rescued Poms’ vaccinations are brought up to date by the adop-
tion group, and the Poms have a complete medical examination.
They may be microchipped, meaning they have a tiny chip with
identification permanently embedded under their skin.
Many rescue groups and shelters provide temperament testing,
basic training, and behavior consultation. Also, adopting from a
rescue group provides you with a safety net if problems arise.
Chapter 4: The Final Selection: Picking Your Perfect Partner 61

Many groups provide you an opportunity to become a club
member, to participate in rescue reunions, and even to become
part of a rescue team.
When you rescue a dog, you also clear a place for another dog that
otherwise may not have a chance. And you bring home a very
lucky dog to an even luckier home.

T
ake a last breath BP (Before Pom) because — for
better or worse — your life will never be the same.
And make no doubt about it, your life will be both better
and worse. With preparation, though, the better can far
outweigh the worse. That’s where these chapters come in.
You want to relax and enjoy your new dog as much as
possible these ﬁrst few days, but that can only happen if
you’ve prepared well before you bring her home. By stock-
ing up on supplies now, you won’t ﬁnd yourself running to
the store every few minutes for one more essential. And
by Pom-prooﬁng your home now, you won’t ﬁnd your Pom
undoing everything just as fast as you can do it.
First day, ﬁrst night, ﬁrst week — you know what they say
about ﬁrst impressions. Make these ﬁrst weeks a great
beginning for this lifetime friendship.

Prepare to Be Pomerized!
In This Chapter
 Purchasing the gear and setting up house
 Preparing your home and yard to be accident free
 Introducing . . . your new veterinarian
You probably plan on celebrating your Pom’s birthday in years
to come, but did you know that dog owners celebrate another
day? It’s called Gotcha Day — the day your new dog comes home,
steals your heart, takes over, and says the doggy equivalent of
“Gotcha!”
Just like any party, you have a lot to do to get ready for your Pom’s
first Gotcha Day! In this chapter, I tell you everything you need to
start out right.
Collecting Pom Paraphernalia
Sure, you can get by with some food, a leash and collar, and maybe
some wire for an enclosure. But where’s the fun in that? You want
to shop! And a new dog gives you the perfect excuse to blister that
charge card. Chapter 8 tells you about all the gear you need to feed
your Pom, but here I discuss all the other odds and ends that you
need to give her the comforts of home.
Housing and transporting
You can’t always hold your Pom in your arms — tempting though
that may be. And you can’t let her run amok when you’re not
watching her. You need a place to confine her, for her safety as well
as your home’s. Crates and exercise pens can save you hours of
frustration, lots of money, and sometimes, your sanity.

Crate
Not only does a crate prevent little Poopsie from depositing little
poopies all over your house, but it also prevents her from gnawing
through your chair legs while you think she’s sleeping soundly at
your feet. And a crate gives her a bed of her own, a safe haven where
she can go when she wants to put out the Do Not Disturb sign.
Crates come in three materials (you can see examples of them in
Figure 5-1):
 Wire: Wire crates are easy for you to collapse (especially the
ones designated suitcase design). Be careful not to throw
your sweater or other valuables on top of the wire crate when
it’s occupied. An industrious dog can pull most materials
through the grating — not a fashionable look when she’s fin-
ished with it.
 Plastic: Plastic crates were developed for airline travel.
They’re very cozy but they don’t allow the visibility and venti-
lation of wire crates.
Figure 5-1: Crates come in plastic, wire mesh, and cloth.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
66

 Cloth: Cloth crates are only for dogs that have been crate-
trained; unsupervised puppies have a habit of chewing and
digging their way out — not good for them or you.
For housetraining purposes, your goal is to buy a crate that’s just
large enough for your puppy to turn around, stand up, and lie
down in. It’s not a playpen, and if it’s too big, she’ll be tempted to
use the far end as a bathroom. (See Chapter 13 for more informa-
tion on using the crate for housetraining.)
The crate is the puppy version of a toddler’s crib. Use it at his nap-
time and when you can’t watch him, but never as a punishment or
a place to store him when you’re not interested in him. If you plan
to use the crate as your babysitter when you’re at work all day,
every day, you need to rethink getting a dog.
Exercise pen
If you can’t leave your puppy in a crate while you’re at work, what
can you do? Let him run loose? Only if you happen to live in a
kennel. Lock him in a bathroom, laundry room, or kitchen? Not a
good idea. He has plenty of ways to get into trouble in those areas.
The solution is an indoor yard or exercise pen (also called an 
X-pen; see Figure 5-2). This is a 4-x-4-foot pen that’s typically wire.
They come in different heights, but a 2-foot-high pen is fine for
your little goofball. In fact, a baby’s playpen works well as an
indoor X-pen for small dogs. (If you have a baby that still uses it,
this idea won’t work; you’ll be vacuuming it constantly!)
You can take the X-pen outside if you want your puppy confined in
the yard. In this case, a wire top for the pen (sold separately) is
particularly handy. Pom puppies are so tiny that large mammals
and birds consider them prey. A secure top may not dissuade a
coyote, but it can stop an eagle from swooping down and carrying
off your dog. Also be sure she has shade and remember to check
on her often. Better yet, sit outside with her.
Carrier
One of the perks of having a Pom is that you can carry her with
you around town in a bag that looks almost like a purse. These soft
pet-carriers are available at prices that range from affordable to
extravagant (think designer variety carriers). Regardless of the
budget, look for one that’s well ventilated, sturdy, and easy to
carry. Flip ahead to the color section of this book to see what a
carrier looks like.
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 67

Figure 5-2: An X-pen is a good place to confine your Pom while you’re away.
Carriers come in handy other times as well:
 On trips to the veterinarian
The carrier helps her feel more secure and makes your job far
easier because you’re not trying to hold her on your lap or
keep her from running up to the other patients.
 For your regular walks in case you ever need to swoop her up
to safety
 Of course, for that stroll down Rodeo Drive
Car-safe restraints
Just as you don’t want any member of your family riding in the car
without a seatbelt, you need to make sure your Pom doesn’t
become an unguided missile in case of an accident. The safest
place for your dog to ride is in a sturdy fiberglass or wire travel
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
68

kennel that’s secured to the car (you may be able to use a seatbelt
to secure the kennel). The next best option is a travel bag, also
secured. For an adult Pom, you can use a seat harness.
Dining ware
Your Pom needs two bowls: one for food and one for water.
Although he can use your bowls for his food and water, most
people prefer to have special bowls for their dogs. Some tips to
remember:
 The best bowls are of stainless steel because they’re easy to
clean and impossible to break.
 Ceramic has the advantage of being microwavable in case of
leftovers, but it can crack.
 Plastic bowls are generally the worst choice. They scratch,
and the tiny scratches are hard to clean. In addition, a few
dogs have allergic reactions to them and develop a pinkish
nose when they eat from plastic.
Walking supplies
One of your Pom’s daily highlights is going walking with you. You’ll
probably walk in different types of places, and you may find that
different circumstances call for different walking outfits — for your
dog, not you!
Collar
You need a small buckle collar for your Pom puppy. But don’t even
think about getting a choke or chain collar for your Pom pup! A
small-size collar may be a challenge to find, so look in the cat sec-
tion. The collar should be loose enough for you to get a couple of
fingers between it and your Pom’s neck.
Never leave the collar on her unattended because she can easily
get her lower jaw stuck in it. Don’t ask how — they just manage to
do it!
The collar is just for training purposes right now. In fact, you
may also want to train her to a small harness, which has several
advantages. For example, your Pom can pull on a harness without
damaging her throat (a problem in some toy breeds), and in case
of emergency, you can safely lift your dog up by the harness.
(A collar, on the other hand, would simply slip off.)
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 69

Leash
Poms also need lightweight leashes, but you may have trouble
trying to find the ideal one because most of them are for larger
dogs. If you can’t find a small dog leash, try the cat department. A
show lead (a leash normally used for exhibiting dogs in conforma-
tion shows) also works well because it doesn’t have a heavy clasp
and is very lightweight. These are available from most online pet
supply catalogs. I show some harness and leash choices in
Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: Be sure your leash is strong but lightweight. A well-fitting harness
may be more comfortable for your Pom.
Avoid chain leashes because they feel like an anchor on your Pom
puppy’s neck. They’re also good at whacking the dog in the face.
Retractable leashes have their place and are very popular, but they
also have shortcomings. First, the good news: A retractable leash
allows you to stand under cover while your dog goes potty in the
rain. (Yeah, that would be the day!) It also gives your dog a little
more range to sniff out his surroundings.
Now the bad news:
 People are careless with these leads. When they let the dog
wander to the end of the extended leash and she makes a
sudden turn, she ends up in the road, splattered by a car. Or
she runs up to a big dog — and gets chewed up.
 People use these leashes everywhere they take their dogs, but
they’re not practical for populated sidewalks and public areas.
 Because dogs have to pull against the leash to extend the
leash, they learn to always pull when on leash — even when
you don’t want them to.
 If you accidentally drop your end of the leash, the plastic
handle scuttles toward the dog, making a racket and often
scaring her. If she takes off running, the handle clacks along
behind so she keeps running in a panic — a bad situation.

Identification
Talk to the breeder or your veterinarian about having your Pom
microchipped (see Chapter 10). You can also have her tattooed.
(No, this isn’t the butterfly-in-a-seductive-place kind of tattoo — it’s
an identification number or her American Kennel Club number on
her inner thigh. Well, I guess that is kind of seductive.)
Plan to get some lightweight identification tags. Although the best
ones attach as a flat plate to her collar, they can be a hassle
because you have to keep changing her collar as her neck grows.
The other choice is a hanging tag, which is problematic because
it’s so large on a tiny dog. If you go the hanging route, be sure to
get the smallest one available. Again, consider products designed
for cats.
Chewies and anti-chewies
Puppies explore with their mouths. They also feel the need to chew,
chew, chew. By giving your Pom something safe to chew, you can
help save him from unsafe chewies. Even so, he’s apt to go hunting
for more chewing adventure. What’s a choosy mother to do?
 Chewies: Puppies like to chew. They like to chew your hands,
your furniture, your clothes, and your wallet. Fortunately they
also like to chew rawhide. For many breeds, rawhide can be a
bad idea because the dog rips off hunks, swallows it, and then
chokes. As long as you get a rawhide chewy — too big for him
to swallow hunks off of — and supervise your Pom as he
chews, he should be fine.
 Anti-chewies: You can buy sprays that make an article taste
so bitter that your dog practically foams at the mouth when
he licks or chews it. Bitter Apple is the best known of these
products.
Tools for setting boundaries
A puppy needs boundaries — to keep her safe and to keep your
home from becoming a shambles. Boundaries also help you train
your Pom by preventing her from getting into trouble. Fortunately,
setting Pom boundaries is fairly simple.
Baby gates
You can’t always keep your puppy in a crate or X-pen (see “Housing
and transporting” earlier in this section), but you can’t always be
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 71

chasing her from one room to the next either. The solution is to
set up baby gates between rooms. Be sure you don’t use the old-
fashioned accordion style, which can close on a puppy’s neck and
strangle her. If you have too many doorways or your doorways are
too wide for standard baby gates, just prop a long, sturdy piece of
cardboard across the opening. (Make sure you can step over it so
you don’t have to move it all the time.)
Ramp
Will you allow your Pom on the furniture? The time to decide is
now. If you don’t plan to have her on furniture as an adult, simply
don’t lift her up there now. If you want to hold her or play with her,
get on the floor with her. (That’s a good idea anyway.)
If you do plan to let her up on furniture, you need a way for her to
get down safely because she can injure herself if she jumps down.
Pet ramps are available to help small dogs hop up and down off of
beds and furniture safely. You can also make your own with some
covered foam steps or plywood ramps. Just make sure the ramp
can’t collapse or fall over.
Fence or kennel
Many Pom owners get along without a fenced yard by walking their
dogs on leashes on regular schedules. But if you have a yard and
plan to let your dog loose in it, at least part of it needs a fence.
Ideally, a fenced area extends from the back door so you can just
open the door to let her out. (You can even add a doggy door and
make your life that much simpler.)
A fence that’s not escape proof is pretty much worthless. Make
sure your tiny Pom can’t squeeze through or under it. And even
though he can’t get over it, your fence must be tall and strong
enough to keep out bigger dogs and dangerous animals.
What about the underground electric fences that give your dog a
warning beep and then a small shock when she gets too close to
the boundary? Not a good idea. Although these fences keep your
dog in, they can’t keep potentially dangerous dogs out.
If you plan to leave your dog unsupervised outside, a covered
kennel run (see Figure 5-4) is your best choice.
Don’t place a run at the back of the yard. Your dog will be miser-
able there and you’ll tend to forget him. If you plan to leave him in
the run — or anywhere outside — for any amount of time, make
sure he has access to shelter.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
72

Figure 5-4: A covered kennel run.
Grooming gear
Eventually you’ll want a well-outfitted grooming kit, but for a
puppy you need only the essentials:
 A soft-bristle brush is an ideal introduction to grooming.
 A medium-tooth comb helps you reach down to the skin.
 Rinseless shampoo is the best kind for a puppy.
If you plan to really groom your Pom at home, a few more items
are necessary (see Figure 5-5). How many supplies you need,
though, depends on how good a job you want to do. At bare mini-
mum, you need
 Medium- and wide-tooth combs
 Slicker brush (a brush with many tiny, bent tines to pull out
dead hair)
 Pin brush (a brush with straight tines to fluff the hair)
 Bristle brush (a medium-texture brush is best for Pom coats)
 Scissors (blunt tips are safer for not stabbing your dog)
 Toenail clippers (for dogs — make sure you get the kind for
small dogs)
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 73

Figure 5-5: The more you groom, the more types of supplies you’ll want.
 Mat rake or mat-breaking tool (for getting out mats)
 Water spritzer bottle (to moisten the coat before brushing)
Another useful item is a grooming table that lets you groom at a
comfortable height. Some tables have a grooming arm that tethers
your dog in place. As long as you teach your dog not to jump off,
you can use any table with a nonslip surface.
Do not leave your dog (any dog!) on any kind of table unsuper-
vised, especially if he’s tethered.
Cleaning up after your pup
Being a puppy owner means becoming a cleaning expert. You can’t
just leave your Pom’s poop all over your yard (or someone else’s,
for that matter), and indoor accidents are inevitable. This section
walks you through the basics of doing the dirty work.
 Poop scoop: A poop scoop isn’t your most exciting purchase,
but it may be the most useful. And it’s far better than makeshift
trowels and buckets because it’s designed to make the job easy.
When you’re walking your dog down the street, the easiest
scoop is a cheap sandwich bag (avoid the thick, zippered
ones).
 Carpet cleaner: Get the kind with enzymes because they
destroy the odor-causing molecules rather than simply cover-
ing them up. Find them at pet supply stores.
 Air freshener: Spray before company comes — assuming you
want these guests to come back.

Toys and other fun stuff
Just like children, puppies need to learn how to have fun with toys
that entertain and educate because
 Toys give puppies something to chew on and toss about in
place of your valuables.
 Toys help develop puppies’ brains and coordination.
 Puppies that never learn to play with toys tend not to under-
stand toy playing (an important activity throughout their
lives) as adults.
Also like children, puppies of different ages appreciate different
kinds of toys. For example, very young puppies like small, soft
toys, so cat toys are often ideal. But because the toys are so small,
you must supervise play with them at all times. Puppies, like chil-
dren, can choke on toys that are too small.
As your puppy matures, he may start liking balls, squeakies, and
tug toys. By the way, tug toys have gotten a bad rap in recent years
because domineering dogs can get the wrong idea of who’s boss if
they continually win the game. But chances are good that your
Pom isn’t a little Napoleon and has no delusions of being stronger
than you.
Just to be on the safe side, when you initiate tug games, always end
the game after you win. And no matter how weak you are, you
surely can win a tug game against a 2-pound puppy!
Special interactive toys are good distractions for puppies and adult
Poms that have to be left alone. These toys challenge your puppy
to dislodge sticky food treats, thereby occupying and rewarding
him over a long time period. Remove these toys when you return
(you can store them in the freezer if they still have food in them)
so your dog looks forward to them the next time you leave. Try
rotating several interactive toys with different challenges to pre-
vent him from getting bored.
Make sure the toys you buy don’t have small pieces that your dog
can pull off and swallow, and make sure he can’t burrow into it and
discover electronic guts. Avoid bean-filled toys, which can pose a
hazard if your dog manages to open them up.
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 75

Preparing for Emergencies
The time to prepare for the unexpected is now. Prepare by getting
your first-aid kit together, making an emergency plan, and knowing
how to handle common crises.
Stocking the first-aid kit
Keep your first-aid kit orderly so you can find each item in a hurry.
And when you’ve used something up, replace it! The single most
important item is the emergency phone number of your veterinar-
ian, but you also need the following:
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
76
 Activated charcoal
 Allergy medication
 Antidiarrheal
medication
 Antiseptic skin
ointment
 Corn syrup
 First-aid instructions
 Hydrogen peroxide
 Instant cold compress
 Latex gloves
 Liquid bandage
 Ophthalmic ointment
 Pen light
 Rectal thermometer
 Scissors
 Self-adhesive (cohesive)
bandage
 Soap
 Sterile gauze dressings
 Styptic powder
 Syringe
 Tweezers
Making an emergency plan
Even when you know what to do, it’s hard to think straight when
an emergency jumps in your face. You need a plan:
 Carry the emergency number of your veterinarian with you in
your wallet or store it in your cellphone.
 Know where the emergency veterinarian is and drive there
beforehand to make sure you know the way. It’s too easy to
get lost when you’re in a panic.
 Never leave your car in your driveway with only fumes in the
gas tank. The last thing you need is a stop at the gas station
so you can make it to the vet.

Designing Spaces Fit for a
Small King or Queen
You don’t have to add an addition to your home just because roy-
alty is moving in — but a little redecorating is in order. Where will
Her Highness be staying?
By day
You want your Pom where she can interact with you but also keep
out of trouble. Use your baby gates and doors (see the earlier sec-
tion “Tools for setting boundaries”) to keep her in a room with you,
unless she’d be underfoot. Then place her in a crate or X-pen,
which you should locate where she doesn’t feel isolated. (Check
out the first section in this chapter for more on these setups.)
When you’re away
Your Pom needs a safe place to spend the day when you can’t be
with her. To give her all the comforts of home, do the following:
1. Place the X-pen on a dog-proof floor (such as linoleum).
For a carpeted floor, lay down an old shower curtain to
protect it.
2. Put the crate or bed in one corner of the pen, bowls of
food and water in another, and a doggy litter box (see
Chapter 13) in another.
3. Throw in some toys and your puppy is ready to kiss you
good-bye for the day.
You can refer back to Figure 5-2 for an example of your puppy’s 
X-pen palace.
By night
What goes in your puppy’s bedtime bed? Consider the following
items to be sure he sleeps tight:
 A soft blanket
 A stuffed animal for cuddling
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 77

 A stuffed puppy comforter that has a place to insert a warm
pad (You warm it in the microwave before insertion.)
These comforters also make a soft noise that sounds like a
heartbeat (much better than trying to slip in a traditional
clock!).
 Any creature comforts that make your puppy feel like he’s
with M-O-M.
Pom-Proofing Your Home and Yard
You hear all the scare stories about baby proofing. But puppy
parents have those worries and more. Human babies don’t have
fangs that can gnaw through wood; they can’t run under furniture
at full speed; and they can’t squeeze into tiny places you never
knew you had.
One way to Pom-proof your house is with a room-by-room search.
To get you started, this section has one list for general safety viola-
tions and then a list for each room. Just to be thorough, I also list
some of the problems your puppy can get into when he’s outside
your house.
Generally speaking . . .
Many hazards aren’t restricted to just one room; the following
widespread dangers can be tough to anticipate:
 Exterior doors: Keep all doors securely closed. A screen door
is an added safety device. Any open door should have a
doorstop so the wind can’t catch it and slam it shut on your
puppy.
 Glass doors: Running into a glass door can cause severe
injuries. Place stickers on glass doors at Pom eye level so she
knows when the door is closed.
 Stairways: A fall on a stairway is like a tumble down a canyon
for little Pomeranians. Open-backed steps are an invitation to
disaster. Always keep a baby gate (see the earlier section
“Tools for setting boundaries”) between steps and your Pom.
 Uncovered electrical outlets: Whatever could be in those tiny
holes? If the puppy licks hard enough, she may find out — she
may even see sparks. This charge is definitely not good for
her tongue or her general well-being. Buy outlet covers at
hardware or baby supply stores.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
78

 Electric wires: Do you have a jungle of vinelike wires under
your desk? Perhaps you just have an occasional wire to a
lamp or phone. That has to be fun to pull on . . . until the lamp
or phone comes crashing down on her or your computer goes
on the fritz!
 Space heaters: Your puppy can get a painful burn if he gets too
close to a hot space heater. He can also knock one over, which
just may start a fire. Keep these heaters out of his reach.
 Ashtrays: Put ashtrays and any nicotine products out of
reach. Better yet, quit smoking — that second-hand smoke
doesn’t do your cute puppy any good.
 Coins: Paper currency may go through your puppy’s digestive
system, but coins can be an expensive meal if your puppy
swallows them. They may get stuck along the path, or in the
case of pennies, sit in the stomach and dissolve, releasing
toxic zinc. Your puppy is not a piggy bank! Keep coins away
from him!
 Purses: These are a Pandora’s box of puppy perils that may
include drugs, cigarettes, coins, and maybe even some pepper
spray. Keep purses away from purse-snatching Poms!
 Unattached bookcases, vases, and statues: What’s up there?
Puppies like to jump onto just about anything. Make sure she
can’t send your oh-so-curious belongings — or the whole
bookcase — toppling over, especially onto her.
 Blinds with long cords: Those hanging strings are fun to jump
at and tug on until he catches his head in a loop and chokes.
Cut the loops, shorten the cords, or buy childproof protectors
for them.
Kitchen
Puppies love kitchens because they usually combine people, good
smells, and dropped food. But kitchens can be dangerous for a
small dog, especially when you’re cooking.
 Cabinets: To puppies, cabinets are like secret caves filled with
treasure. But the cave holds dangers like poisonous cleaners
and degreasers. Remember to either place bad stuff elsewhere
or secure all your cabinets with child safety latches.
 Plastic bags, wrap, and aluminum foil: Put these items out of
reach. They may be fun to chew, but they sure are difficult to
digest.
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 79

 Plastic canisters: It was funny when Winnie the Pooh got his
head stuck in the honey jar, but if your puppy gets her head
stuck in just-the-right-size jar, it can form an airtight seal
around her head and suffocate her. It’s happened.
 Puppy underfoot: Puppies fancy themselves gourmet chefs in
the making. They want you to shake up all the ingredients, so
they run between your feet when your hands are full. And by
sticking their heads in the open refrigerator, they also ensure
that you don’t close the door too soon. Unfortunately a Pom
puppy’s skull probably isn’t as strong as a refrigerator door.
Keep the little chef out of the kitchen while you’re cooking.
Dining room
Your Pom’s second favorite room just may be the dining room —
especially if you have messy eaters in the family!
 Swinging door: If you have a swinging door, stop it from
swinging or take it off its hinges.
 Hanging tablecloth: Can the puppy jump up and snag the
tablecloth? Yes. Can the puppy jump out of the way of the fine
china plummeting toward her as she drags the cloth off the
table? Maybe.
Family room
The family room is a great place to cuddle and play with the puppy,
but don’t just walk out and leave her alone to find trouble. She may
not have to look far.
 Fireplace without secure fire screen: A fireplace fire is as big
as a forest fire to a Pom puppy! He may not realize just how
hot it is until his fur is ablaze. And he can catch your house on
fire by removing a burning stick and then throwing it down on
your papers. Even if you have a fire screen, don’t leave your
puppy alone around a fire.
 Sewing or knitting basket and craft kits: Needles and pins
can perforate any part of the digestive tract. And thread, yarn,
or any long, stringlike object can cause the intestines to
accordion, which is potentially fatal. Also, castor beans (used
in some beading projects) contain ricin, one of the most dam-
aging chemical toxins of plant origin.

80

Bedrooms
I know you want to relax, but don’t go sleeping on the job. There’s
still plenty of mischief possible in the bedroom!
 Toys: You were careful to buy puppy toys that she couldn’t rip
apart and swallow, but what about other stuffed animals she
may find around your house? Swallowing parts of toys can
cause blockages — not to mention hard feelings with the kids.
 Open closets: Missing a shoe? Whose fault is that? Close the
closet door!
 Diaper pail: Yuck! But when you say “Yuck!” your dog says
“Yum!” Dogs do eat soiled diapers. Besides the disgusting
sight, diaper material can cause blockages. Solution? Keep
diaper pails out of reach. Simple.
Bathroom
The bathrooms can be the most dangerous room in the house for
people. What about for dogs?
 Pills: Childproof caps aren’t puppy proof, so he can just gnaw
right through. And with his tiny body weight, it takes only a
fraction of a pill to wreak havoc on his body. Even small doses
of pills like acetaminophen and ibuprofen that are safe for
people can be deadly for dogs.
 Toiletries: Razors, perm solutions, hair coloring, suntan
lotions, deodorants, and rubbing alcohol are just a few exam-
ples of items you need to keep out of your puppy’s reach.
 Drain cleaners: Drain cleaners are designed to dissolve
organic material. You puppy is all organic material. Don’t let
them mix.
 Toilet with open lid: Your Pom puppy is probably too short
to reach, but where there’s a will there’s a way.
Laundry room
Most sensible Poms steer clear of any room that involves work, but
sometimes an adventurous one goes exploring And some owners
use the laundry room as quarters for their dog. Make sure you spot
the dangers before he does.
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 81

 Detergents, bleach, and lye: If your puppy finds a box of
white stuff, she can have a great time simulating a snowstorm,
flinging white powder everywhere. But that powder burns
eyes and throats, and bleach can be blinding or fatal.
 Open dryer door: Snatch something out of the dryer, leave
the dryer door open, and walk away. Who walks in? Your
puppy, looking for a soft, warm place to snuggle. Then you go
back and decide you need to dry those clothes a little longer.
If the tumbling doesn’t get him, the heat will.
Garage
Your Pom doesn’t need to have NASCAR aspirations to find all
sorts of entertainment in the garage. Unfortunately, he’d be safer
driving a race car than nosing around the contents of a typical
garage. Best advice? Keep him out altogether!
 Antifreeze: A sweet treat on the garage floor beckons to your
puppy. But just one lap of antifreeze containing ethylene glycol
can kill him. Even if he merely licks his paws after walking
through it, he can become extremely ill. Use only antifreeze
with propylene glycol, which has reduced toxicity. And be sure
to clean up any spills.
 Fluids: Gasoline, diesel, oil, kerosene, brake fluid, carburetor
cleaner, windshield fluid, paints, paint thinners, acetone,
mineral spirits, pool chlorine, wood stain, furniture polish,
glue, and batteries are all potentially deadly. Keep them up
and away.
 Tools: Tools can seriously injure you when they fall on your
foot. Imagine what they can do if your puppy knocks one down
on his own head. Keep him away from cords and work areas.
 Car: Always check on the dog’s location and put him up
before moving the car.
 Garage door: Broken necks and backs can come from garage
doors being slammed carelessly, and even automatic doors
may not stop in time. Never leave your Pom loose when the
garage door is shutting.
 Power tools: Would you let a toddler hang around when
power tools are in use? Then don’t let a puppy around.
 Nails, tacks, and screws: These aren’t meant to go inside a
puppy’s digestive tract, and they’ll cost you one very large
veterinary bill to extract.
 Herbicides, rodent poisons, slug bait. They’re designed not
only to kill but also to taste good. But they taste good and kill
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
82

dogs, too. The fatal effects may show up days later, long after
you’ve assumed he’s fine.
 Fertilizers: These have one simple guideline: What’s good for
a plant is bad for a puppy.
Outside
Of course, doggy dangers aren’t limited to the indoors. Check your
yard for trouble spots, whether man-made or natural.
Man-made accessories
The outside of your home isn’t usually designed with the safety of
a tiny dog in mind. Check out your outdoor living space for danger.
 Decks, balconies, and upper-level open windows: Most rail-
ings weren’t designed to keep tiny dogs from slipping through.
Put temporary fencing or other barriers around the edges.
 Unsealed deck wood: Pressure-treated wood contains
arsenic; if the wood isn’t sealed regularly, the arsenic can
leach out and be toxic to a puppy that licks the wood.
 Weak fence: A weak fence is a ready-made challenge course.
Every time your Pom finds a way out, it reinforces his determi-
nation to keep trying. Show your pup from the start that this
is one challenge he can’t meet. Make sure the fence meets the
ground. For Poms that love to dig, extend some wire under-
ground toward the inside of the yard.
 Unfenced pool: Just like toddlers, dogs can fall in swimming
pools and drown. They may swim for a while, but when they
get too weak to hang on to the side, they eventually go under.
Keep the pool securely fenced, give him swimming lessons,
make sure there’s a way out, and make sure he knows how to
find the way out.
All things natural
Even a suburban backyard can seem like a jungle to your little
Pom — and a dangerous one unless you know what to look for.
 Predators: Don’t let your small puppy outside alone, and con-
sider a mesh-top exercise area (refer to Figure 5-4) if large
eagles and other birds of prey are around. Other predators
include
• Coyotes and mountain lions that look for an opportunity
to snatch a small dog if he’s alone in the yard
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 83

• Alligators that consider dogs a delicacy
• Unfortunately, bad people who may want to steal a
Pomeranian puppy
 Wild animals: Beware of poisonous snakes, snapping turtles,
giant marine toads, and various animals that may injure a
curious puppy in self-defense. Inspect your yard for insect
hives, underground nests, and fire-ant mounds.
 Treated lawns: Wait at least 24 hours before letting your
puppy on a treated lawn or around treated bushes.
 Nut trees: Nuts can be fun to play with and even to crunch on.
But the nuts can cause blockages and have to be surgically
removed.
 Poisonous plants: Many plants can be bad for your puppy.
To be on the safe side, don’t let her graze among yours.
Check your plants against the complete listing online at
www.aspca.org or consult with your veterinarian. Some
common poisonous plants include
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
84
• Azalea
• Castor bean
• Corn cockle
• English holly berry
• Foxglove
• Jerusalem cherry
• Jessamine
• Lily
• Milkweed
• Mistletoe
• Oleander
• Philodendron
• Rattlebox
• Rhododendron
• Water hemlock
 Tree limbs: Rotted limbs can fall on a small dog, killing him.
Even falling fruits and pine cones can hit a dog in the head
with fatal results.
 Cocoa mulch: Cocoa mulch has a sweet taste, but it contains
theobromine, the same ingredient in unsweetened and semi-
sweet chocolate that’s fatal to some dogs.
Exercising caution during 
holiday decorating
Have you stopped to think about how a puppy may affect your hol-
iday traditions? Besides making sure you no longer travel alone
guilt-free, your puppy can quickly show you how not to decorate
your house.

Christmas
Santa brings good puppies a stocking of gifts, but bad puppies get
in a ton of mischief. Christmas tree lights, ornaments, popcorn
strings, extra electrical cords, tinsel, candles, and angel hair can be
enticing but dangerous to puppies. Ribbons, twine, and foil wrap-
ping (and the gifts they wrap) can also pose dangers.
If you wouldn’t leave a particular gift on the floor unwrapped, then
don’t leave it on the floor wrapped. (It’s just a matter of time.) This
rule is especially true of edible items; your Pom’s nose isn’t fooled
by some flimsy wrapping paper!
Christmas parties mean lots of opportunities to slip out the door,
get stepped on by guests, or be overwhelmed by company.
Unattended alcoholic beverages, coffee, chocolates, nuts, illicit
drugs, and cigarettes beckon to a curious Pom. Some owners err
by tying festive ribbons around Fido’s neck and then letting him
play unsupervised. Place him in a secure area or crate during par-
ties or hectic times.
Outside your home, salts used to melt ice on walkways can irritate
a dog’s paws. Some of these salts are poisonous if your puppy licks
her paws. And be aware: She can get frostbite or become hypother-
mic if she’s left out in the cold. Use common sense — if she acts
cold, she is cold!
Christmas cactus isn’t toxic, but many holiday plants are. Keep
this list in mind:
 Mistletoe and Jerusalem cherries are highly toxic, particularly
the berries.
 Holly berries are somewhat toxic.
 Poinsettia is not as toxic as most people think, but it still can
cause gastrointestinal irritation.
Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving means turkey leftovers that a dog can be truly thank-
ful for. But too much turkey can make a dog sick because large
amounts can cause pancreatitis in susceptible dogs. Share a little
turkey with your Pom, but don’t overdo it (and be sure his helping
doesn’t have bones).
Independence Day
More dogs are lost on the Fourth of July than on any other day.
They can become so frightened of loud fireworks that they escape
Chapter 5: Prepare to Be Pomerized! 85

and just run in terror. Your dog also can be burned by sparklers
and injured if she chases firecrackers. Leave your Pom at home
(in a soundproof room if possible) during fireworks.
Halloween
Sure, it’s fun to dress up and see how the dog reacts. But one mon-
ster after another at your door can make your dog go nuts. Put her
away if she overreacts to trick-or-treaters, and remember to keep
Halloween candy well out of reach.
Finding a Vet and Scheduling
the First Appointment
Plan to line up a veterinarian even before your puppy comes home;
you want him to have an appointment during that first week for a
health check and any scheduled vaccinations. Be sure to bring his
vaccination and worming record with you (see Chapter 4 for more
info on these records) so the veterinarian knows which treatments
he’s already had.
But first, you want to find a veterinarian you like. Because the two
of you will form a partnership in caring for your Pomeranian’s
health for years to come, you should choose carefully. Although
the closer the clinic, the better, sometimes it’s worth driving right
past the clinic down the street for a veterinarian more suited for
your needs.
And there are other factors to consider: What hours is the clinic
open? How does it handle emergency situations? Some veterinari-
ans trade off with each other for off-hours duties; larger towns
often have a dedicated pet emergency clinic. Clinics with more
than one veterinarian have several advantages such as appoint-
ment availability and collaboration between veterinarians in diffi-
cult cases.
Before your puppy becomes a regular patient there, check out the
facility. Ask for a tour. The clinic should be clean and have safe,
sanitary overnight accommodations. Look for American Animal
Hospital Association accreditation, which is given only to hospitals
meeting certain standards. And of course, the fees shouldn’t make
you pass out when you get the bill — at least no more so than the
other clinics in town.

Coming Home
In This Chapter
 The first journey: Bringing your Pom home
 Connecting with the family
 Surviving the first night — you and your Pom!
C
ongratulations! It’s a Pom! The big day is finally here. You’ve
Pom-proofed your house and filled the puppy basket with
necessities — you’re ready to welcome your new addition!
But wait! You have a few more preparations to make before you’re
ready to roll. For example, you need a way to comfortably trans-
port your new addition and a game plan for introducing her to the
new house, family, and other pets, if you have them.
Your happy homecoming will be exciting, but you still want to
manage that excitement. Remember, your little Pom may be more
than a little anxious about leaving the only home she’s ever known
and saying good-bye to Mom and the other kids. You want her first
impression of her new home and family to be a happy occasion,
not a terrifying misadventure.
With the suggestions in this chapter, you can make this event a
good memory. I provide you with solid advice on the first trip
home, the first hours around new faces and surroundings, and . . .
the first night alone.
Making that First Trip
Safe and Sound
You’ve picked out your Pom; now it’s time to pick him up and bring
him home. Whether it’s a trip across town or from a neighboring
state, plan to coordinate your pickup with the breeder.

Scheduling the pickup time
Schedule your arrival time early in the day; you’re likely to be at
the breeder’s a while and you want to get home well before your
pup’s bedtime. The breeder will want to give you care instructions
(feeding, grooming, and early training) and make sure you under-
stand them. These guidelines may seem overwhelming, and you
may end up feeling frazzled. If only there was a book about
Pomeranians for new owners that could help you know what to
expect. Oh, wait! You’re reading it, aren’t you? So don’t worry —
you’ll do fine on the first day.
Be sure to confirm your arrival time with the breeder so he doesn’t
feed the puppy right beforehand. This timing should lessen the
possibility of car sickness or nervous diarrhea. Yuck!
If you work during the week, arrange to get your new dog on a
Friday or just before your vacation time. That way you can spend
plenty of time with him and be able to nap when he naps. With any
luck, you won’t feel like a walking zombie from sleep deprivation
on Monday morning.
Preparing to drive Miss Daisy:
What to bring
Ready to hop in the car and cruise to the breeder’s? Not so fast!
That car may not look — or smell — so pretty when you get home
unless you bring some stuff with you to make the trip go a little
more smoothly. And chances are your little one doesn’t have much
car-riding experience.
Here are the necessities for your trip:
 Another adult: Even a good friend may not be so thrilled if you
pack her in with the rest of the gear, so save the front seat for
her. She can ride along with you and lend an extra pair of
hands. You’ll be grateful for the help if the puppy starts fussing.
 Carrier: Just as a new baby doesn’t ride home from the hospi-
tal in your arms, neither should a new puppy — or even an
older dog. Regardless of the length of the trip, bring a dog car-
rier with a towel in the bottom. Bring extra towels in case of
accidents.
 Cleanup supplies: Some rinse-free shampoo and paper towels
are also handy just in case he has an accident and gets it all
over himself.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
88

 Drinking water: Bring some bottled water or an empty bottle
that you can fill with water from the breeder’s home. Changes
in water can give some dogs upset stomachs. Why risk it in
the car?
 Money: When you head to the breeder’s place, don’t forget
your money! Unless the breeder has indicated a personal
check is acceptable, bring cash or a cashier’s check.
 Toys: Be sure to bring something (a chew toy or even a
stuffed animal for cuddling) to occupy him.
 Food: If the trip will last a couple of hours or longer, bring
some of the same food he’s been eating. Hypoglycemia (low
blood sugar) is a concern in these little ones (see Chapter 8
for more on this), so don’t put off a meal too long just because
you’re traveling. Ask the breeder ahead of time what your dog
has been eating; either buy a small bag of it in advance or ask
the breeder whether you can buy a few days’ supply from him.
Have your pup’s first meal waiting at your home. Even if you
don’t have a long ride, chances are the breeder won’t feed her
right before she leaves for your house.
Note: Even if you’ve selected the ultimate canine ambrosia,
start by feeding the same food the breeder has been feeding
her. She’s facing enough changes without having to cope with
a new food that may upset her tummy — and your housetrain-
ing plans. If you plan to switch her to another food eventually,
be sure to do it gradually. Abrupt changes in diet can lead to
puppy diarrhea.
 Collar and leash: Bring a secure leash and collar just in case
you have to take him out. You don’t want him bolting away,
falling down a storm drain, hiding under a parked car, or
doing any of the hundreds of dangerous tricks a loose puppy
can do. But be forewarned; he probably doesn’t know how to
walk on a leash. Don’t get your hopes up for much walking or
relieving.
If you’ve planned an overnight trip to collect your Pom, read about
traveling with a Pom in Chapter 12. Bring a playpen or exercise pen
and place plastic sheeting beneath it.
Your new pup may not look like the pup you chose a few weeks
ago. If you’re concerned, say so. Good breeders would never switch
puppies on you, so if you’ve chosen a trustworthy breeder (check
out Chapter 3), you don’t have to worry about this scenario.
Chances are, your puppy has just changed with age. However, if
she no longer looks healthy, ask whether you can come back at a
later date to get her. A good breeder doesn’t want you leaving with
a sick puppy any more than you do.

Managing a Happy Homecoming
As you pull into your driveway, it hits you — your life will never be
the same! You now have a new little one ruling over your every
move. Your household may become a tiny Pom dynasty, but that’s
a small price to pay for Pomeranian pleasures.
Now, did you catch the emphasis on little, tiny, and small? As
tempting as it may be, this is not the time for a welcome home
party with friends and neighbors. Stop a minute and try to view
this from your pup’s low-down-close-to-the-ground perspective:
Your little Pom (whether pup or adult) was driven in a big, unfamil-
iar car to a big, unfamiliar house to meet big, unfamiliar people.
And there may be some big, unfamiliar pet mates to boot.
Your new Pom needs to figure out who’s who and how to be brave
in her big, new world. Being greeted by a wall of noisy new faces,
reaching hands, and sniffing noses isn’t going to help. Let her focus
on just you and your family this first day and night.

When the dog flies home
To collect your dog from the airport, give yourself plenty of time to locate him.
 If he’s flying air freight, he may go to the air freight office, which may not be part
of the main terminal.
 If he goes to the baggage pickup, he must be hand carried from the door. (He
won’t be placed on the conveyor belt!) Be sure you’re there to meet him, and
have identification with you in case you’re asked for it.
He probably messed his shipping crate, so be ready with extra towels and cleanup
supplies. Also bring some scissors to cut the plastic cable ties that airlines often
add for extra security. You can’t open the crate unless you can cut through those
ties. (And try not to look dangerous while wielding your scissors or knife in the
airport!)
Technically, you’re supposed to keep your dog in the shipping kennel until you’re
outside the terminal. Obviously, this doesn’t work with big dogs, so most airports
allow you to take the dog out right away as long as you don’t abuse the privilege. In
other words, keep him in your arms and on a leash until you get outside. If you find
a grassy area, give him a chance to urinate.

Gaining a sense of place
Your first goal is to give your new Pom a sense of place, to become
familiar with his surroundings. Keep distractions (like other people
and pets) to an absolute minimum because your Pom has a lot of
sights and smells to process. Consider these suggestions:
 Calm the kids. If you have children, they’ll likely be excited to
see the new puppy. But they have to be calm or else wait in
another room.
 Secure other animals. Make sure all your other animals are
put up.
 Take him to the grass. Introduce your Pom to the spot you’ve
decided will be a good bathroom (read more about this in
Chapter 13). He probably won’t use it because he has no idea
what you want. But at least you’ve given him a chance.
 Show him the Pom-approved spaces. After he’s had a little
time to check out the outside bathroom, take him inside and
let him loose in the part of the house you’ve designated as
Pom friendly (Chapter 5 has more details on this step).
• Start by introducing him to the places most important to
him: his eating area and sleeping area. Put a bit of food
in his bowl so he’ll get the idea.
• He may be glad to be out of his crate, so don’t expect
him to go back in for a while. He’s also probably curious
about this strange new world, if a little scared. But don’t
overwhelm him with a tour of the whole house — even if
you live in a one-room apartment. Leave something for
later!
Always stay with him as he explores. He may never have been
loose in a house before, so he’s a prime candidate for trouble. If he
chews on an electric cord, give a harsh warning sound like Ahgt!
and remove him from temptation.
Don’t be surprised if he has an accident inside almost right away.
That’s why you want to take him back to the bathroom area sev-
eral times while he’s looking around. Review your Pom’s gotta-go
signs in Chapter 13, and be ready.
Meeting the family
Now that your new Pom has had some time to begin settling down
in her new environment, you can begin introducing her to the
people in your family. If it’s just you and another adult, then you
Chapter 6: Coming Home 91

may have accomplished this mission during the ride home. If you
have children, especially young ones, they’ll need to develop a
little care and a lot of calm for your Pom.
Here are a few guidelines for your kids to follow when they meet
the new dog for the first time:
 Patiently take turns holding the new dog. Avoid any fighting
over the puppy or any rough handling. Small dogs are fragile,
and even the best-intentioned children can end up causing
injury.
 Use indoor voices and avoid being too loud around the dog.
Screaming with excitement may put the dog on edge.
 Avoid chasing the puppy. It’s hard not to get carried away
with a game of chase! But a fun game to the two-legged
chasers may feel like a run-for-your-life situation to the
chasee.
 Sit on the floor nearer the new dog’s level. The Pom can
easily move from one seated person to the next without being
dropped or tripping a child. Note: A puppy can trip a toddler,
but the toddler’s still big enough to squish the puppy if he
falls on her.
This is such an exciting time, and kids tend to forget all these
guidelines when the Pom starts bouncing around. If you take time
to explain that these guidelines help the dog feel safer and more
secure, your children will most likely show care as they meet the
new member of the family.
Everyone in the house needs to know how to hold a puppy (see
Figure 6-1). Always pick the dog up with one hand cradled under
her chest (never by her legs, nape of neck, or anywhere else). Then
rest the dog against your chest and hold her securely underneath
with your other hand.
Saying “Hello” to doggy or kitty
If you have other animal family members, chances are they’re very
curious about the little intruder you’ve allowed in their home.
“Surely,” they think, “you don’t intend to keep that thing in the
house, do you? Woof! Hiss!”
Even if you have abnormally friendly dogs and cats, oversee these
introductions carefully to ensure that the bigger or rougher animals
don’t injure the small Pom. You also want to be sure the established
animals don’t become jealous of the newcomer. If you have more
than one other pet, make these introductions one at a time.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
92

Figure 6-1: How to hold a Pom correctly.
Meeting dog to dog
The best place for new dogs to meet is in neutral territory so your
resident dog doesn’t start acting uppity and territorial. You can go
to a neighbor’s yard or for a walk side by side — assuming your
puppy will walk on a leash! For meeting one or more other dogs in
the house, place the puppy in his exercise pen or crate before let-
ting the other dogs into the room, one at a time, to see him. You
can also sit and hold the new Pom on your lap. Note: If your other
dog is large, avoid holding your Pom up above him because dogs
have a tendency to jump and grab at things held up in the air.
Either separate the dogs by a barrier or have them both on leashes.
Some dogs use the barrier as an excuse to start fence fighting,
which means acting ferocious as long as something’s between
them. If this fighting starts, you can separate the two dogs, place
them on leashes, and try again.
Keeping an eye on the dogs’ behaviors
Watch how the resident dog and your newcomer react to one
another. A puppy will probably be curious but cautious. Some pups
get excited, in which case you need to prevent her from jumping all
over the resident dog or from starting a chase-me scene. An older
new Pom may be laid back, frightened, or have a devil-may-care
attitude — you never know.
Chapter 6: Coming Home 93

Meanwhile, a resident dog may be curious, approach the puppy,
and try to sniff. These are all good signs. Watch for these other
signs that the introduction is going well:
 Your resident dog is sniffing, with ears relaxed or held slightly
forward.
 Your resident dog is in a play bow position, with front legs on
the floor and butt in the air (see Figure 6-2).
 You can distract your resident dog with a treat.
Some dogs rush up to the new dog, overwhelming her. Even if the
resident dog’s intentions are friendly, the newcomer can become
so frightened that she tries to bolt, which can trigger a chase
response in the other dog. Note: If the resident dog is bigger, you
may have a cops-and-robbers chase scene right in your own home!
Don’t allow any chasing or rushing at this point.
Some dogs approach stiff-legged, like they do with a strange adult.
This response can be appropriate, but after the dog figures out the
newcomer is a youngster, he needs to stop the tough-guy act and
sniff nicely.
Figure 6-2: The play bow position means a dog is in a good mood.
Watch for these trouble signs. You may want to stay close or at
least keep the resident dog on a leash:
 Your resident dog is walking stiff-legged.
 Your resident dog is staring intently at the Pom.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
94

 Your resident dog jumps at the Pom without play bowing (see
Figure 6-2).
 Your resident dog growls or snarls at the Pom.
Fostering a friendly canine relationship
Try not to rush a new dog’s relationship with your other dog —
they probably won’t become instant buddies. As they get to know
one another during the next week, make sure you lay the ground-
work for a good relationship. Here are a few guidelines:
 Your resident dog is the king or queen and should remain so.
This fact means he gets fed before the new dog, gets loved
before the new dog, goes through doors before the new dog,
and basically gets treated like royalty in comparison. This
show of favoritism is tough when you’re so enthralled with
the new dog, but the perfect recipe for jealousy is to push the
resident dog into the background while you gush over the
newcomer.
If an older dog has a hard time getting over this jealousy, she
may lash out to put the usurper in her place. The reaction is
the older dog’s misguided attempt to show you exactly who’s
more deserving.
 There’s no need to lock the older dog away whenever the
puppy comes out to play. However, allowing the puppy on
your lap while you make the older dog stay on the floor isn’t a
good idea.
Make the puppy’s presence a sign of good times to come. For
example, when the puppy eats all those extra puppy meals,
give your older dog a small treat too.
 Puppies often come with a get-out-of-trouble-free pass with
older dogs. This apparent liberty means the pup can crawl on
them, bite them, and do all sorts of tricks that an adult dog
doesn’t allow another adult to do.
Your older dog’s tolerance doesn’t mean she likes that kind of
play. Make sure your grown dog has an escape route (perhaps
a high sofa she can get on or her own crate) so she can get
away from the little pest. And be ready to put the pest up.
 Allow your adult dog to warn an irritating puppy. In other
words, let her growl at times (like an older sibling tells a
younger one to leave her alone!). If you don’t allow this
response, the dog may tolerate the pesky pup too long and
jump the pup — without warning! If your puppy doesn’t heed
the warning, help him out by removing him and placing him
back in his exercise pen.
Chapter 6: Coming Home 95

 Keep your puppy from eating out of the other dog’s bowl,
especially if the other dog is larger. Although you don’t want
to encourage food-possessive behavior, it’s a natural reaction
when dogs are around other dogs. Until your puppy under-
stands proper etiquette, he needs your help to avoid dumb
stunts.
Meeting the cat of the house
Cats rule! Or at least they think so. Your Pom will probably try to
make friends with your cat, but your cat may have other ideas.
Most cats don’t like strangers rushing up to them, especially ones
that lick, nip, and yip. For this reason, have your Pom in a pen or
on a leash when you introduce her to the cat. And make sure the
cat has a higher place to jump to so he can look down and feel
superior to this little vermin you call family (Hrmph!).
If the dog starts to chase the cat (or vice versa), put an end to it
immediately. If the dog gets too fresh with the cat, the cat’s likely
to swipe her with his paw. Don’t punish the cat; just hope the dog
is smart enough to need only one lesson.
As with older dogs (see the previous section “Fostering a friendly
canine relationship”), follow this advice:
 Make sure you don’t give your cat reason to be jealous of the
new Pom.
 Heap on the attention and treats to your cat when the puppy’s
around.
 Make sure the cat has abundant puppy-free zones in the
house.
Settling In on the First Night
You’ve made it through the first day — your pup is safe in your
home, introductions have been made, he has begun sizing up his
new kingdom (inside and out!), and he has some idea of where his
next meal is coming from. Nice job! Just a few more hours and
you can say your first day is really over. This section helps you
call it a success by giving you suggestions for the nighttime
challenges.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
96

Starting a routine from the get-go
Just like young children, young dogs benefit from a bedtime rou-
tine. Naturally, the first part of establishing a routine involves pick-
ing a set bedtime for every night. Here’s one to consider:
1. About 30 minutes before bedtime, feed your young
puppy his last meal of the day.
Reduce this to a snack for older puppies.
2. About 20 minutes after your dog eats, take him out to the
bathroom.
He must take care of his business before hitting the sack.
3. Take him to his sleeping quarters and settle him inside.
4. Go to bed.
At least, try to go to bed. If your Pom is experiencing
some anxiety, read the next section for guidance on 
what to do next.
5. If he awakens in the middle of the night, carry him out
to the potty place again.
This is not a time for playing. Give him a few minutes and
return him to bed. Even better, set an alarm clock for the
middle of the night so you, not the puppy, decide when he
goes out. No fair hitting the snooze!
This cycle may repeat throughout the night, but it really does
get better!
Calming those first-night jitters
When the first night falls, you place your pup in her crate (see the
previous section for the steps that precede this and Chapter 5 for
more on the crate), say “G’night,” turn out the lights, and all’s well.
Right? Maybe. Scared and lonely, a Pom pup does what most pups
do in that situation: She screams and cries in an attempt to be
reunited with her family.
Your Pom puppy is coping with a situation you can’t even imagine
for a human baby — she’s suddenly removed from her family and
home, the two elements that have made her feel secure her entire
life. This situation is far less traumatic if the breeder separates the
puppies for increasing lengths of time before they leave, but this
preparation may not alleviate the sudden stress of a new home.
Chapter 6: Coming Home 97

Even older or pre-owned Poms are nervous in a new setting. After
all, how would you like to find yourself suddenly spending the
night in a stranger’s house? Try these suggestions:
 Give your Pom a place he can call his own — a crate, bed, or
special corner of the couch — to help him feel at home.
 A treat or chewie can help keep him in place and convince
him this new place is pretty neat!
You may have been told to ignore your wailing puppy so you don’t
spoil or reward her for crying. But what does that really teach her?
Only that in the most frightening situation she’s ever encountered,
nobody’s there to help her — no matter what she does. Her real
mother would never treat her that way. Some dog behaviorists now
believe this traditional advice may contribute to separation anxiety
(see Chapter 15) in adulthood.
This new attitude doesn’t mean you spend the rest of your life
rushing in at the slightest cry, offering your dog a floorshow or a
buffet. It simply means that you take her out of the crate, attend to
her basic needs, comfort her, and place her back in the crate, much
as you would a crying baby. (Okay, so the crate’s not a good visual
for a baby, but you get the idea.)
You’ve already decided on sleeping quarters for your puppy in a
place not too far from your family activities (Chapter 5 covers this
topic). But if that choice means she’s all alone in a remote part of
the house at night, it can get awfully lonely over there! You may
have to amend your plans. The easiest solution is to bring her
sleeping quarters into your bedroom, at least for a few nights
(and with your spouse’s approval of course!).
What about your Pom sleeping on your bed? This isn’t a good idea,
mostly because of safety concerns. Consider these possibilities:
 A Pomeranian puppy is so small you can roll onto him in your
sleep.
 Even if you’re a light sleeper, he can still fall off the bed.
 The bed may be so large that he feels comfortable making one
corner his personal bathroom — bad for your bed sheets,
your sleep, and his housetraining.
If you want to hold him for a while as he drifts off to sleep, fine, but
then carefully place him in his own bed for the night. If you sleep
alone, you can place the crate on the bed. This way you can stick
your fingers in it so he can gain some comfort from you.

The First Few Days
In This Chapter

You never get a second chance to make a first impression! And
this is your big chance to make a good impression on both a
future best friend and a beloved family member. Gulp!
Now that I’ve put the pressure on you, you can calm down. In fact,
that’s my number-one piece of advice for these first days: Keep it
calm — your new Pom has enough excitement just meeting you
and your family. But beyond that, I have a few tips that may come
in handy when it’s time for your pup to meet new people, go new
places, and become a proper member of your family.
Getting to Know Your Pom
A Pomeranian puppy makes new attachments quickly, and even
adult Poms begin to think of their new owners as family within a
couple of days. For your new dog’s sake, keep visitors to a mini-
mum for the first day. After all, if a parade of people pop in, how
can he figure out which ones really matter?
Keeping the newness of it all in mind
During these first days you’ll help your new dog form friendships
with other family members and get used to her new surroundings.

Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
100
Research shows that these tasks are significant because at about
12 weeks of age, she naturally becomes more hesitant about novel
situations and strangers. The more situations she’s exposed to
before then, the fewer challenges remain that can wig her out.
With socialization, it’s the quality — not the quantity — that
counts. As with all things puppy, you need to introduce new experi-
ences gradually, never pushing your pup past the point that she’s
scared. Keep these points in mind:
 Your children are no doubt anxious to play with the new dog,
so make sure they don’t get too rambunctious and that the
puppy has time to herself. Too much harassment and she may
start hiding whenever they show up.
 The same is true for her new canine and feline family. Have all
pets play inside at first or in a confined area outside so they
can’t run out of control and out of your reach.
Bonding with humans big and small
Before you start introducing your Pom to other people, at home or
away, keep in mind and share these strategies, which can make
introductions go much more smoothly:
 Hold your dog in your arms. This way new faces don’t tower
over your Pom as people greet him, and you don’t have to ask
them to sit on the ground!
 Keep people from rushing up or creeping slowly up to him.
Rushing is startling and creeping is, well, creepy. Creeping is
actually too much like stalking and can unnerve some dogs.
 Remind strangers not to look the dog in the eye when they
say hello. To a dog, that direct stare is threatening. A perfect
way to scare the bejeebers out of your Pom is to have some-
body creep up to him, bend over, stare him in the eye, and
then reach out to pet his head. Be prepared to clean the pee
off the floor.
If the dog’s uneasy, the person can face sideways, which is
less threatening, or sit on the floor and wait for the dog to
approach. When your dog’s at ease, the person can gently rub
the pup’s chest or neck.
 Encourage people to rub your dog under the chin or on the
chest instead of petting him on the head. Like humans, dogs
don’t like being pounded on the head.

At home
Help your pup with these gradual steps in socialization:
 Plan for your puppy to meet only one or two people at a
time. These people must be gentle and nonthreatening. You
can have them offer him a treat to cement the friendship —
sort of the opposite of what people tell their children (“Hey,
little dog, want a piece of candy?”).
 Stage a puppy party for people and your dog. Invite people
to your house and, one at a time, have them greet your puppy.
They should walk up to you and your dog casually and then
nonchalantly put out a hand for your dog to sniff.
Near home and beyond
For now, avoid places where other dogs congregate. But after your
veterinarian assures you that your puppy’s vaccinations are suffi-
cient, try to take your pup to as many places as possible.
Make each exposure a good experience by doing the following:
 Go for a walk around the block and see who you bump into.
You can try to direct a meeting by picking up your dog and
perhaps handing the stranger a treat to give to your pup.
 Introduce your Pom to children, especially if you have no
children at home. The best plan is to avoid random children;
instead, invite only children that are calm and obedient to
visit your home and meet the puppy.
 Avoid the all-dogs-like-me person. If you meet this person,
tell him your appendix just burst and then scurry away.
 Explore public places (like sidewalks, parks, and some out-
door cafes) that welcome dogs. Avoid taking your puppy to a
crowd with the idea of her meeting lots of people at once. She
can be stepped on, and people can terrify her if they all try to
reach and pet her.
Going to the Vet for Your
Pom’s First Checkup
Plan to take your new puppy for a health check within a couple of
days of bringing her home. In fact, your contract with the breeder
may specify a required time frame for this checkup to keep the
health guarantee in place.
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 101

Checking out the doctor
Your Pom’s life may depend on your selection of a veterinarian,
so — next to you — this person may be the most important one
in your pup’s life. You can ask for recommendations from local
breeders, kennel-club members, or trainers, but of course, you’ll
ultimately want to see for yourself by making an appointment.
Take note of how well the veterinarian listens to your concerns:
 Does he communicate clearly?
 Does he treat your dog gently?
 Does he regularly treat Poms or toy dogs?
Ask how many of these patients he has and whether he feels
comfortable doing surgery on them. Chances are he has quite
a few such patients, but it never hurts to ask.
I like to schedule some routine appointments at first so I can check
out the veterinarian. But you can simply ask to visit and tour the
facilities. If you don’t like one clinic, try another.
Making the first appointment 
a success
This first visit has more importance than the basic checkup; it
should be a time for your puppy to discover that going to the vet-
erinary clinic is fun. To make the most of this visit for you, the pup,
and your veterinarian, keep the following suggestions in mind:
 Bring any health records the breeder provided and a stool
sample (from the Pom, of course!) so the doctor can check for
intestinal parasites.
 Use a travel bag or small crate to take your dog to the clinic.
 Keep her close to you in the waiting room and keep her from
barking at other animals. They may have serious illnesses,
and their owners will appreciate the courtesy.
Bring favorite treats so the veterinarian and staff can give them to
your dog. It’s always best if the first exam doesn’t include needles
or cavity searches. If an injection is necessary, ask the doctor to
replace the syringe (after drawing the vaccine) with a tiny-gauge
needle before sticking the dog. This way the injection hardly hurts
at all!
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
102

This first appointment allows the veterinarian to diagnose any
common puppyhood problems (like worms) and discuss your
Pom’s vaccination schedule and heartworm prevention regime.
The veterinarian also
 Listens to your pup’s heart to make sure she doesn’t have a
potentially serious problem
 Weighs your puppy
 Checks your Pom’s teeth and gums
 Probably examines ears and eyelids
 Perhaps checks the knees for early signs of patellar luxation
 May give vaccinations
Vaccinations are a medical procedure. The veterinarian must
determine the schedule of shots according to your Pom’s
body and how it works even though it may not seem like the
most convenient schedule to the owner.
Before leaving the clinic, be sure to ask about heartworm and
flea prevention (if the doctor hasn’t mentioned it) and schedule
an appointment at the appropriate time for your Pom’s next 
vaccinations.
Consider just visiting the clinic’s waiting room sometimes so the
pup has experiences there where nothing bad happens. Sure, she
has to get shots sometimes, but drop in another time just to say
“Hi.” The staff will appreciate your efforts to make their patient
comfortable, as this casual visit makes working with her easier on
the staff in the long run.
If you’re acquiring an adult Pom, schedule a checkup for her within
a few days of welcoming her home. At this initial check, the veteri-
narian performs all the checks that a puppy gets at its first visit
plus probably a heartworm check.
Acclimating the Pup
to His New Life
Although meeting people and other animals is one of the most
important missions you have for your puppy these first weeks, it’s
not the only one. This is also the best time to introduce your
puppy to new experiences. Do you plan for him to ride in a car?
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 103

Stay in a crate? Go to the groomer or veterinarian? Learn some
tricks? What else? Make a list and try to expose him to each
situation now.
Making a crate feel like
home sweet home
Your Pom may have already spent some time in a crate. With luck,
he has had good experiences. But more often his experiences have
been limited to the trip from the breeders and perhaps his first
night away from home, both kind of scary.
Take time now to acclimate him to the crate. The following are a
few good reasons:
 The crate provides a secure place where you don’t worry
about your Pom.
 Crates provide a safe means of car travel and a safe haven
when staying with friends or at hotels.
 A crate-trained dog fares better if he has to be crated at
the veterinary hospital or needs bed rest at home while
recuperating.
 Crates help in housetraining. (I knew you’d like that one!)
Getting her to like the crate
As with all new routines, getting your Pom to look at the crate as
something other than a holding bin will take some time and delib-
erate moves. The following steps can help you achieve success:
1. Leave the door open and toss some treats just inside the
door at first.
Gradually toss them farther and farther inside after she’s
stepping in to get them.
2. Toss in a larger bone she may want to chew on. Tie the
treat to the inside of the crate if she tries to take it
outside.
Now she has to stay inside if she wants the goods! You also
can use a toy filled with treats.
3. Untie the treat and close the door while she feasts, only
for a few seconds at first. Open it as soon as she finishes.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
104

4. Keep repeating this routine.
Within a day or so she should be running to the crate as
soon as she sees you with treats. If you want, you can now
introduce a cue like Bedtime! for her to go in the crate.
5. Gradually extend her time in the crate, always giving her
chew toys or interactive toys to occupy her.
6. Try to let her out before she has a chance to get bored or
vocal. If she begins to protest, wait until she’s momentar-
ily quiet before letting her out.
7. Continue to extend the time she must be quiet before you
release her.
How long will it take? For some dogs, about a day. For others, a mil-
lennium. Every dog is different, but the earlier you start, the better
your chances of it going well.
Some words of caution
The crate is one of the safest spots your puppy can be, but you
must do your part.
 Remove your Pom’s collar while he’s in his crate. Collars,
especially choke collars or collars with tags, can get caught in
crate wires and strangle the puppy.
 Discourage chewing on the wire by spraying it with anti-chew
preparations and by making sure your pup has no issues with
being crated (see the training steps in the previous section).
If your puppy tends to chew on the wire, he can get his jaw or
tooth caught.
Overuse can create serious behavioral problems. Think of the crate
as your child’s crib — a safe place to sleep but not a place for your
pup to grow up or be punished.
Contrary to popular opinion, crates don’t seem to make young
pups feel more secure. In fact, crated pups (especially those not
already familiar with the crate) tend to cry even more than
uncrated pups when separated. If he cries, try leaving your pup in
an exercise pen or small, safe room when you first start teaching
him to be home alone. You can leave a crate with an open door
accessible to him.
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 105

Encouraging independence
and relieving anxiety
As important as socialization is for your Pom, her acceptance of
being alone is equally vital for her well-being. Don’t put this step
off just because it’s not as much fun as her other lessons.
When you understand your puppy’s anxiousness and your role in
helping her feel secure, you’re more prepared for the job ahead of
you. Like her other training, this process takes time, patience, and
a plan.
It’s in the genes . . . and the screams
Dogs are very social animals. From an evolutionary viewpoint, a
puppy alone is vulnerable, not likely to survive unless he does
whatever he can do to get back to his family. A puppy that finds
himself all alone gives out a distress vocalization (okay, a scream)
which brings his mother running.
Without his mother (or his caregiver, now that he’s in your home),
a puppy keeps crying until he’s too exhausted to continue. But
exhaustion is not the same as being okay. He begins to associate
being crated or left alone with being frightened, and this distress is
likely to build on itself, creating a lifelong problem.
Your puppy is seeking security. Comfort him from the beginning to
prevent him from becoming so stressed in the first place. Then,
when you begin encouraging his independence, you need to know
how long to leave him as well as how to leave him.
Leaving, but just for a while
Your pup needs to understand that when you leave her you always
return. She builds this confidence by being left alone for very short
times that gradually lengthen to longer times. Try these steps:
1. Start by occasionally leaving the room for just a minute
before popping back in.
2. Move to a longer time period only when your pup seems
content and calm at the current time period.
The object is to return before your pup gets restless or
anxious.
3. Gradually build up to 10, 20, and 30 minutes away from
your pup.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
106

The biggest barrier to success is leaving the pup alone too long.
Nobody ever got over being scared of being deserted by being
ignored. Be patient, and go slowly. You’ll make much more
progress if you return while she’s still calm at 10 minutes than if
you wait until she’s having a fit at 11 minutes.
How do I leave thee?
The fact that you leave and return isn’t a newsworthy event, so do
it without ceremony — no long good-byes or joyous reunions!
Distressed puppies are too upset to eat or play. However, giving
your pup something to occupy and comfort him while you’re gone
is useful.
 Mirrors and soft cuddly toys seem most effective at calming
separated puppies.
Try soft, warm, dog-shaped toys that even have a heartbeat,
simulating the pup’s littermates.
 Interactive toys that challenge your puppy to dislodge sticky
food treats are good distractions for bored, but not dis-
tressed, puppies.
 The buddy system (that is, having another dog or cat around)
may help your Pom, but don’t rely on it. Your other pet may
not always be there to babysit.
Getting used to riding in the car
Your puppy may have had a couple of car-riding experiences so
far — to the veterinarian for shots (oh great!) and to her new home
with you (oh no!). Chances are, neither ride was much fun. Combine
those thrills with the fact that lots of puppies get carsick, and your
Pom may think the car is one awful contraption.
Your job is to make your pup associate the car with good times.
Try these suggestions:
 Go for very short rides to fun places before nausea and
diarrhea can even begin to churn. For some dogs this means
opening the car door, setting the puppy inside, driving 20 feet,
and getting out to play — or to let him puke. (Hint: If he
pukes, you’ve gone too far.)
 Check your driving habits. The more often the speed changes,
the more nauseous your puppy gets. If you live in hilly coun-
try, try to maintain a constant speed up and down hills.
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 107

 Bring the puppy to the front of the vehicle. Although a crate
is usually safest, riding in a crate can increase motion sick-
ness in some dogs. Looking out of a window can help alleviate
some cases of motion sickness. Experiment with somebody
holding your pup — and a lot of towels and plastic sheeting.
(Sounds like a bad joke, doesn’t it!)
 Give your Pom gingersnap cookies; they may help alleviate
carsickness.
 Ask your veterinarian about motion sickness pills for your
dog as a last resort.
Enjoying Playtime
Play is one of the reasons we have dogs. Sure, it cements the human-
canine bond and all that stuff. But the real reason is that it gives us
an excuse to act like idiots. You don’t want to pass up that chance.
Play also provides a safe arena in which puppies can pick up new
behaviors and develop self control.
Engaging the hesitant Pom
If your puppy’s hesitant about playing, start with cooperative
instead of competitive games. Such games include
 Learning fun tricks
 Playing fetch
 Searching for hidden treats
 Playing alongside you with toys that squeak or are easy to
manipulate
These games can gradually build to more competitive games;
for example, cat toys dangled on a string may become a low-key
tug game.
Outsmarting the push-
and-shove Pom
Some Poms are pushy when they play. They not only prefer more
competitive games but also try to control them! Conventional
wisdom says that such games give your dog too much control, but
you can play them and still call the shots.
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
108

For example, if a game of fetch ends up a game of keep-away or tug
of war, use it to encourage cooperation. Take these simple steps:
1. Come up with a game-over word, like Give.
2. Teach your Pom (in an enclosed area) that Give! means
Trade! because you trade him a treat for whatever he has.
3. Walk away and ignore him if he refuses to give up the
prize.
This game becomes a handy command for around the house — for
those times he’s playing keep-away with your $20 bill or new pack-
age of razor blades.
Drawing the line with
your nipping Pom
Although many new dog owners worry that their little puppy is a
budding Cujo, most puppies grow out of nipping on their own. You
want to make sure, though, that play stays fun and that she stops
nipping when you request. Those barracuda teeth can hurt!
Play it cool
Puppies react roughly with one another, escalating their fighting
until the going gets so rough that one of them cries “Uncle!” and
leaves. Most pups quickly figure out that if they bite another dog
too hard, it’s game-over.
You can reinforce clean fun with your pup with the same tactics.
1. When your pup chomps down on you, yelp sharply and
withdraw from him, standing still and ignoring him for
20 seconds or so.
2. If he stops nipping and instead behaves, quit your statue
act and give him a treat.
Because your yelp may encourage him to play even harder, you
may have to experiment with several versions before your dog
realizes you’re serious. (The neighbors are going to love this!)
Focus on the positive
Nipping is fun! So give her something to do that’s equally fun.
Reward her for not nipping by giving her a toy to carry, a ball to
chase, a chewie to chew, or a tuggy to tug. If she knows a trick,
reward her for doing it.
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 109

You also have to do your part to minimize the nipping in the first
place:
 Avoid wriggling your fingers in front of the puppy’s face and
then yanking them out of reach as she lunges for them.
 Keep from shuffling your slippered feet around on the rug
while your puppy pounces on them. Well, okay, that is kind of
fun, but it can lead to her biting your ankles.
 Convince the rest of your family and any visitors to discour-
age puppy nipping.
Rarely, the biting is not in play, so it’s important for you, as the
owner, to spot the signs of true, aggressive biting. Snarling, with
ears back, is a sign of possible trouble — especially when com-
bined with protecting food or assets, being picked up, or being told
to move.
If you’re still concerned, see Chapter 15, where I discuss aggression.
Growling is a natural part of a pup’s playful nipping. Did you know
that what seems like a growl may actually be a laugh? Dog laughter
is a rough sound made only when exhaling, and it’s typical of dogs
playing competitively such as in tugging games. Unfortunately
many people misinterpret the sound as a growl and even punish
their dogs — just for laughing.
Laying Down the House Rules
One of the best parts of adding a Pom to your family is spoiling
him rotten. After all, you’re not going to undermine his chances at
becoming a business tycoon or college graduate. And he’s hardly
equipped physically to be a canine serial killer. Who cares whether
he’s spoiled, right?
Not quite. You don’t want your friends to start avoiding you
because of that obnoxious brat that’s always biting at their heels,
and you don’t want your own life and household taken over by a
furry Napoleon.
Explaining the laws of the loveseat
Most Pom owners welcome their pups on the furniture, but even
little Poms have muddy paws, chew holes in the cushions, and
leave fur on the furniture. If you don’t want her on the furniture,
you can
Part II: When Your House Becomes Your Pom’s Home 
110

 Get furniture that’s too high for her to jump up on.
 Teach her early on that her place is elsewhere.
You can always let her up when she’s older, but you can’t easily
ban her after she’s enjoyed the lap of luxury.
Getting up on the furniture is no cause for getting down on your
pup. Simply follow these guidelines:
 Lift her down to a place of her own. (It has to be a really
good place to compete with that sofa and its view, though.) A
deluxe dog bed in an equally entertaining spot that has a good
vantage point should get her attention.
 Train her to go to that place on cue by rewarding her when
she goes there on her own. As she starts to eagerly run to her
bed, give her the cue Place! and reward her after she’s there.
If your Pom sneaks onto forbidden furniture, it’s not the end of the
world. In other words, forget the booby traps, shock pads, or
rough handling.
A far less traumatic dissuader is newspaper, aluminum foil, or
another uncomfortable surface on the furniture. Most dogs quickly
decide their own bed is preferable! (Then again you can just give
in — after all, a Pom was meant to share your sofa!)
Keeping his chompers on chewies,
not chairs (or shoes!)
Like babies, puppies chew when they’re teething. But unlike
babies, they keep it up when they’re well past teething. And just
when you think you’re safe, they seem to go through a super chew-
ing stage near the age of 1 year. They chew papers, cushions, chair
legs, rugs, shoes — pretty much anything of value. What to do?
The best-laid plans . . .
You can meet with some success if you combine the following
moves:
 Keep your important, valuable items out of sight as much as
you can.
 Watch your pup as much as you can.
 Slather horrible-tasting products like cayenne pepper or com-
mercially available bitter tastes on those tempting items that
you can’t move out of his reach.
Chapter 7: Starting Off on the Right Paw: The First Few Days 111

 Wrap aluminum foil around your chair legs. Your puppy won’t
find it very enticing to bite . . . but your guests will ask who
your decorator is.
 Try to guide him toward chewing more acceptable objects.
(See the next section for ideas on this.)
Choose his chews carefully
The kinds of objects your puppy chews on at an early age tend to
be his favorites the rest of his life. When you find your pup chewing
on your belongings, simply take the object from him and replace it
with a more acceptable object. Here are some suggestions:
 Make sure the new object doesn’t resemble items you don’t
want him to chew — old shoes, socks, stuffed animals (if you
have children who collect them), carpet remnants, and so on.
 Try rotating his toys so he only gets a few at a time. Every few
days put one set away and replace them with some other toys.
This way he has the excitement of new toys every few days.
 Engage him with interactive toys like the ones he has to work
at to extract food. Fill these with bones, soft cheese, canned
dog food, or peanut butter, and then freeze them to make
them last even longer.
Punishing him does little good, and you can make matters worse if
you punish him right when he proudly brings you the trashed
treasure. Congratulations! You’ve just trained him to take your
treasures to a secret location so you never get them back!

Caring for Your Pom
from Head to Paw

In this part . . .
“A
ll you add is love” or so the saying goes. But in
Pom World, it’s deﬁnitely an understatement. In
addition to food and love, you add coat care, tooth care,
nail care, eye care, and ear care. You add vaccinations,
parasite prevention, and unwanted pregnancy prevention.
You add the know-how to recognize and cope with the
minor and major illnesses from puppyhood to senior 
citizen, and you add the ability to act on emergencies.
You also add care, whether your dog is on the road with
you or staying behind. And you add preparation in case
the unthinkable happens and your little dog is lost.
Love is an essential ingredient — but you need to add
much more. The chapters in this part show you how.

 Deciphering dog food labels

 Feeding dogs with food-sensitive disorders
F
eeding a little Pom seems pretty simple: Buy a giant bag of dog
food, open it up, and let your dog tunnel his way from one end
of the bag to the other. Replace the bag once a year or when he
gets to the other end, whichever comes first.
Of course you know better — and want better. One of the joys
of having a tiny dog is the luxury of feeding him only the best.
But tiny dogs have big challenges when you try to decide the best
for them.
Your Pomeranian thinks you must be the greatest hunter on earth
as you return from the grocery store with bag after bag loaded
with food. Eating is one of a dog’s great joys in life. Help him be
happy and healthy by hunting down the best and tastiest foods.
Avoiding Toy Dog Food Follies
It’s not unusual to see people buy giant bags of dog food filled with
giant chunks of food suited for giant dogs — and then feed those
chunks to their tiny dog. But that’s like handing your baby a lob-
ster and telling her to have at it. The intention may be good, but
it’s not right for her size. Like your baby, your Pom needs not only
age-appropriate food but also size-appropriate food for reasons of
safety, nutrition, and enjoyment.

Feeding bite-sized bits
Look at those tiny teeth and jaws! You can’t expect your Pom to
munch down those rocks of kibble that larger breeds practically
inhale. He’s likely to just give up chewing and swallow them whole,
which makes for a bad situation.
Too many dog treats and kibbles are actually choking size for a
Pom. In fact, many popular training treats (which are purposefully
small — about 1⁄2 inch in diameter — for larger dogs) are the per-
fect choking size for a Pomeranian.
To ensure your Pom’s snack-time safety, try the following tips:
 Squish some dog-training treats to make them flatter.
 Try human donut-shaped cereals.
 Tear off bits of flat string cheese.
 Give her small pieces of thin deli meats.
Many dog food companies now make dry food specifically for small
dogs. Besides being easy to swallow, it’s usually more nutrient-rich
and higher in calories. For more on dry dog foods, see the later
section “Perusing the Pet-Food Aisle.”
Watching out for low blood sugar
It’s no hype: Low blood sugar, technically known as hypoglycemia,
can kill. This emergency condition is related to feeding, and you
see it mostly in small, young, stressed, or active dogs.
Pomeranian puppies and some adults can’t store enough readily
available glycogen (the form of glucose that their bodies keep in
the muscles and liver for energy). When the glycogen runs out, the
body starts breaking down fat for energy. But because puppies
have very little fat on their bodies, they quickly deplete this energy
store. And when that store is empty, the brain (which depends on
glucose to function) starts having problems. The puppy may start
to get weak and sleepy, perhaps wobbling and stumbling if she has
to move. If she doesn’t get glucose soon, she can have seizures,
lose consciousness, and die.
Don’t worry too much about hypoglycemia. For most Poms, it’s
just a puppyhood concern, and they outgrow it by 7 months of age
or so. But all Pom owners need to be aware and ready, especially if
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
116

your dog stresses easily. Just feed regular, frequent meals that con-
tain complex carbohydrates, and be on the lookout for lethargic or
otherwise odd behavior.
Keeping blood sugar at a healthy level
Hypoglycemia sounds scary, and it is! But you can take a couple of
steps to make sure your Pom never experiences it.
 Don’t let your Pom puppy go more than four hours without
eating. If that’s not possible (like in the middle of the night),
make sure he’s warm, confined, and quiet so he doesn’t use
much energy.
 Make sure his foods are fairly high in protein, fat, and com-
plex carbohydrates. Complex carbs slow the breakdown of
carbohydrates into sugars. This steady breakdown leads to
more efficient use of the carbs rather than a roller-coaster
ride of highs and lows.
Complex carbohydrates are mostly from the whole-grain
groups, such as corn, rice, and wheat. Although you can’t
just feed your Pom a loaf of bread, you can feed him a good-
quality commercial dog food that contains some grain-based
ingredients.
 Avoid simple sugars, such as sweets and semimoist foods.
However, keep those foods on hand in case your Pom starts
having signs of hypoglycemia.
Reacting quickly to a blood-sugar deficiency
If you suspect your Pom is becoming hypoglycemic, you need to
get some simple sugars into her. Follow these steps to perk her up
quickly:
1. Try to give her corn syrup (a good choice for quick
energy), but if she won’t swallow it, rub it on her gums
and the roof of her mouth.
2. Feed her semimoist foods (the kind that look like fake
meat and come in a clear pouch) if she’ll take them. But
don’t put anything in her mouth that can choke her!
3. Keep her warm and call your veterinarian.
If you’ve gotten enough sugar in her, she should start show-
ing signs of improvement while you’re on the phone —
within a couple of minutes. However, she still may need to
go to the clinic for intravenous glucose.
4. Give her a small, high-protein meal like meat baby food
when she’s feeling better and can eat.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 117

Avoiding toxic table scraps
Even though your intentions may be kind, your dog isn’t a barking
garbage disposal, so don’t treat him like one. Table scraps are
okay here or there. But a few table scraps can fill your Pom’s little
belly — make sure they’re nutritious. And remember: When he
finds out how good your food is, you can expect him to want more.
Strangely, people are able to eat certain foods that appear to have
toxic effects on dogs. This effect is magnified in small dogs. Avoid
these human foods:
 Alcohol: Can get a small dog drunk with just small amounts
and can be deadly in larger amounts.
 Chocolate: Contains theobromine (a mild stimulant related to
caffeine), which can cause death in dogs because they metab-
olize it more slowly than humans do. Baking chocolate is
especially toxic. As little as half an ounce can be life-threaten-
ing to a 4-pound Pom.
 Macadamia nuts: Cause some dogs to get very ill; scientists
don’t understand the cause. (The choking hazard is also an
obvious warning sign.)
 Onion: Destroys red blood cells in dogs. Eating an entire
onion can be fatal to a Pom.
 Peach pits and other fruit pits and seeds: Contain cyanide.
 Raisins and grapes: Have been associated with kidney failure
and extreme sudden toxicity in some dogs.
 Raw dough: Can expand inside the warm environment of the
gut, causing impaction.
 Xylitol, an artificial sweetener in some chewing gums: Can
cause a sharp drop in a dog’s blood sugar, resulting in depres-
sion, loss of coordination, and seizures (see the preceding
section for more on this dangerous situation).
Boning Up on Nutrition
Feeding a tiny dog entails some considerations that you may not
have to think about for a large dog.
 Pint-sized Poms have tiny tummies. You may be able to feed
a big dog a handful of potato chips and cookies before a meal,
but try that with a Pom and her stomach’s going to be too full
of junk to fit in any nutritious food.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
118

 Little dogs need more calories per pound of body weight
compared to big dogs, so their food needs to be jam-packed
with essential nutrients and energy. Study the ingredients
and nutritional analyses on commercial dog foods. You don’t
have to be a nutritionist, but understanding some basics can
help you make decisions. Note: The dry foods that target the
wee ones usually cram in more calories per gram than the
foods for their larger counterparts do.
The nutrition guidelines in this section are for healthy dogs. Dogs
with health problems have special nutrient requirements or
restrictions, as I describe in Chapter 10.
Nutrients come in two basic varieties: those that provide energy
(calories) and those that don’t. Both types are vital.
The energy providers
Although you usually think of nutrients as providing energy, that’s
just one of their jobs (see the next section for more info), and even
foods that provide energy have several different functions.
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates make up the bulk of ingredients in most commercial
dog foods, and the most digestible carbs are in starches and sugars.
But dogs can only utilize nutrients from cooked carbs; even then,
they utilize the carbs to different degrees, depending on the source.
The following list ranks the sources of carbs from best to worst:
1. Rice
2. Potatoes and corn
3. Wheat, oats, and beans
Active dogs have a hard time maintaining weight and condition
when their diet is too high in carbs The more-poorly digested
carbs (numbers 2 and 3 in the list) are especially guilty of causing
diarrhea and flatulence. If this sounds — or smells — like your
Pom, don’t blame the dog! Just change her food to one with higher
protein or better-quality carbohydrates.
Dogs need particular enzymes to digest the carbs from dairy prod-
ucts and soybeans. But when they’re not regularly eating these
foods, that enzyme activity can be low. So, if you intend to give
dairy products and soybeans to your Pom, slowly work up to
higher levels of these foods. Need more convincing? When enzyme
activity is low, the carbs end up fermented by colonic bacteria,
which produces — you guessed it — diarrhea and flatulence.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 119

Protein
Protein contains various amino acids that provide the building
blocks for bone, muscle, coat, and antibodies. Eggs have the high-
est quality and most digestible proteins, followed by milk, fish,
beef, and chicken (the latter two are tied).
Puppies need higher levels of protein than do adult dogs, and old
dogs need even higher levels than puppies.
Keep these points in mind:
 Your Pom requires very little food, so consider buying foods
that include high-quality protein.
Because meat and other animal-derived protein sources are
expensive compared to plant-derived sources, commercial
food companies tend to use minimal amounts of animal pro-
tein and often use less wholesome sources, such as meat and
bone meal or animal by-product meal.
 Many people add meat or even eggs to their dog’s commercial
food, which is probably a good idea. Note: No supplement
should add up to more than 10 percent of the total diet.
Always cook the eggs because raw egg whites contain a sub-
stance that makes biotin unavailable. By cooking the whites
or by serving them along with cooked yolks (which are so
high in biotin that they offset the deficit), you don’t risk a
biotin deficiency.
 A variety of meats ensures the best sampling of essential amino
acids, but proteins from plants aren’t as beneficial (although
soybeans are almost as high in amino acids as chicken). In
addition, most proteins from plants are more difficult to digest
and have insufficient levels of some specific amino acids.
Fat
Fat provides energy, contributes to good taste, and aids in the
transport of fat-soluble vitamins. But too much fat can cause diar-
rhea, obesity, and a reduced appetite for more nutritious foods.
In contrast, diets deficient in essential fatty acids cause skin prob-
lems, inability to reproduce, and slowed growth.
To provide a good balance of fat in your Pom’s diet, include rich
sources of fatty acids, such as egg yolks and vegetable oils, and
aim for a diet with at least 5 percent fat dry matter (the amount of
nutrients in the food minus the water content). To figure this per-
centage out in nondry foods, see the formula later in “Reading the
label and between the lines.”
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
120

The non-energy providers
Nutrients also provide substances that are essential to life, even
though they may not fuel the body directly. For example, you may
not think of water and fiber as nutrients, but they, along with vita-
mins and minerals, are critical components of a good diet.
Water
Water is the single most important nutrient. Although your Pom
(and all of us, for that matter!) can skip other nutrients for a day or
even a week with little noticeable consequence, your Pom needs
water every day. Water dissolves and transports other nutrients,
helps regulate body temperature, and helps lubricate joints. Like
all animals, your Pom’s body consists mostly of water. If he gets
dehydrated, he can become very ill.
Although water is a pretty simple dish to serve, your dog will
appreciate your thoughtfulness in serving it. Follow these sugges-
tions and revel in your little friend’s contentedness:
 Consider using filtered or bottled water. After all, how much
can a Pom drink!
 Keep the water bowl full at all times. Just because the water’s
running right through her and perhaps wetting the carpets is
no excuse to hold out.
 Change the water every day; wash the bowl each time.
 Add some ice to her water on a warm day. Your Pom appreci-
ates the gesture — just like you do.
Vitamins and minerals
Dogs require the following vitamins in their diet: A, D, E, B1, B2,
B12, niacin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folic acid, and choline.
Minerals help build tissues and organs, and they’re part of many
body fluids and enzymes. Deficiencies or excesses can cause
anemia, poor growth, a strange appetite, fractures, convulsions,
vomiting, weakness, heart problems, and many other disorders.
Most dog foods have vitamins in their optimal percentages, so sup-
plementing with vitamin tablets is rarely necessary. And supple-
menting your dog’s diet with minerals, especially calcium, is not a
good idea.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 121

Fiber
Fiber (like beet pulp, rice bran, or various gums) affects the
absorption of other nutrients including carbs, proteins, fats, and
some vitamins and minerals. Although fiber is common in weight-
loss diets to give the dog a full feeling, its effectiveness is contro-
versial; some research suggests that it doesn’t really help dogs
lose weight or even feel less hungry.
Fiber does increase stool volume and encourages more frequent
defecation. So, if your Pom’s poop is as big as he is, check the fiber
content of his food — it could be you’re using a diet food with more
fiber than standard foods, or that you’re using a cheap food that’s
mixed in a bunch of peanut hulls to save money. Look for a fiber
content of about 4 percent for dry foods and 1 percent for wet foods.
Perusing the Pet-Food Aisle
What is it about the pet-food aisle that transforms confident con-
noisseurs into confused consumers? It’s probably all those labels
shouting out to proclaim high protein, low fat, hypoallergenic, small
breed, large breed, puppy, and geriatric. You just want to grab a bag
and go, but there are too many choices. Don’t worry — all you
have to do is narrow them down, and I help you do just that in this
section. Start by deciding the form of food and then move on to
comparing labels.
Comparing bags, cans, and pouches
Commercial foods come in dry (bagged), canned (wet), and semi-
moist (pouch) varieties. Differences among them are as follows:
 Dry (bagged): Pomeranians, like most tiny dogs, can develop
dental problems, but chewing hard foods may help avert
them. The typical kibble, however, simply crumbles when the
dog bites into it. Specially formulated dental foods maintain
their shape long enough to scrape against the tooth surface.
Note: After dental problems develop, the teeth may be too
sensitive to chew any hard food. See Chapter 9 for more infor-
mation about dental problems.
 Canned (wet): Most Pomeranian owners use canned food in
their dog’s diet, either mixing it with dry food or making it the
entire meal. However, a diet of just canned food isn’t advis-
able because it provides no chewing action. Canned foods
also tend to be higher in fat, which adds to their texture, so
they may not be good for dieting dogs.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
122

Some veterinarians recommend feeding canned foods and
other supplements first, then finishing the meal with dry feeds
for better cleaning action from chewing. Some dogs with
dental problems (missing, loose, or sensitive teeth) may only
be able to eat soft foods; these dogs, of course, need veteri-
nary attention first and foremost.
 Pouches (semimoist): These foods are high in sugar and lack
the better attributes of dry and canned food. The high sugar
content makes them particularly unsuited for tiny Pomeranians
or Pom puppies because the sugar can create a rebound situa-
tion that leads to hypoglycemia (check out “Watching out for
low blood sugar” earlier in this chapter for this dangerous
condition).
However, semimoist foods may be handy to keep around in
case a dog’s showing signs of hypoglycemia and needs a sugar
fix. Some wet foods now come in pouches, too.
When buying dry food (which I highly recommend), keep these
tips in mind:
 Dry foods formulated for small dogs are definitely a good
idea. Many of the standard dry foods are too large for tiny
Pom mouths. In addition, small dogs require more calories in
relation to body weight than large dogs do (see this chapter’s
earlier section “Boning Up on Nutrition”).
 Buy the little bags. The food loses it nutritional value, can
become rancid, and can hatch little bugs and moths (yuck!)
when it sits around too long. Don’t stock up on it.
 Poms eat so little food that you can afford to buy the best.
Reading the label and
between the lines
Ignore the picture on the food package of the cute dog doing a
back flip for the juicy hunks of meat pouring into his bowl. Your
dog will probably just stand there, and the food won’t look any-
thing like the picture.
Instead, look for the statement that declares the food to be com-
plete and balanced according to feeding trials. Some foods are
declared healthy simply because of their ingredients. But because
dogs may metabolize some ingredients better than others, the
better food companies go the extra mile to test several generations
with that food alone.

Know what your dog is really eating
When buying food for your Pom, be aware that what you see isn’t
necessarily what your Pom gets. Marketing buffs have found a way
to mask not-so-great food qualities in an enticing description.
Hmm, imagine that.
Look at the name of the food and consider its real meaning. Buyer,
beware!
 A commercial food labeled beef flavored may not even contain
beef if feeding trials show a dog recognizes the food as beef.
 A food labeled with beef may contain as little as 3 percent
beef.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
124
Understanding label lingo
Here’s how to decipher the list of ingredients in commercial dog food:
 Meat: Mammal flesh including muscle, skin, heart, esophagus, and tongue
 Meat by-products: Cleaned mammal organs including kidney, stomach, intes-
tines, brain, spleen, lungs, and liver; also blood, bone, and fatty tissue
 Meat and bone meal: Product from processed meat and meat products
 Poultry by-products: Cleaned poultry organs, feet, and heads
 Poultry by-products meal: Product from processed poultry by-products
 Fish meal: Dried ground fish
 Beef tallow: Fat
 Soybean meal: By-product of soybean oil
 Cornmeal: Ground whole corn kernels
 Corn gluten meal: Dried residue after the removal of bran, germ, and starch
from corn
 Brewer’s rice: Fragmented rice kernels separated from milled rice
 Cereal food fines: Small particles of human breakfast cereals
 Beet pulp: Dried residue from sugar beets (for fiber)
 Peanut hulls: Ground peanut shells (for fiber)
 BHA, BHT, ethoxiquin, sodium nitrate, tocopherols (vitamins C and E):
Preservatives (tocopherols generally have the fewest health risks but also the
shortest shelf life)

 A beef dinner or entrée need not contain beef as its major
ingredient, but beef products must make up at least 10 per-
cent of the total product.
 Only a product that contains at least 70 percent beef can be
labeled simply beef without any fancy modifiers. (The same is
true for other types of meat.)
After checking out the marketing copy, study the label (it lists
ingredients in descending order according to their amount). You
want a product that has at least three animal-derived ingredients in
the first six ingredients. But pay attention to words such as meal
and by-products.
 Animal meat meal is unfit for human consumption because it
can come from dead and even slightly decomposed animals.
True, your dog may think a can of sun-roasted road kill is
ambrosia from heaven, but that doesn’t mean you should buy
it for him.
 Meat by-products tend to be perfectly good parts of animals.
They may turn your stomach, but your dog finds them delec-
table. They’re perfectly safe and nutritious, just not something
you usually serve your human family — unless they’re visiting
and you’re ready for them to leave. Spleen, anyone?
Weighing the nutritional value of dry versus
wet versus semimoist foods
The first time you read labels, you notice that the dry foods seem
jam-packed with nutrition compared to the canned or semimoist
foods. And they are — kind of, sort of. Canned (wet) foods, espe-
cially, have so much water that it makes their nutritive content
look low. So technically, if you really want to compare dry and wet
foods, you have to first factor out the moisture contents and then
compare them on their dry matter.
Here’s how to equate nutrients in foods with different moisture
contents:
1. Subtract the listed moisture content from each food.
For example, if a food contains 75 percent water, then
25 percent of the food is dry matter.
2. Divide the remaining number (the food’s dry matter) into
each listed nutrient percentage.
In the example for Step 1, if the food listed its protein con-
tent as 10 percent, then divide 10 percent by 25 percent to
get 40 percent protein based on dry food matter.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 125

3. Compare the protein content of the nondry to the
dry food.
You may be surprised to see that the seemingly puny per-
centage of protein in the canned or semimoist food is really
quite high. Of course, you’re still paying for a lot of water!
Deciding How Much, How Often
Pomeranians have been called the hummingbirds of the dog world
because of their high metabolism. They have to eat more food
more often than larger dog breeds. So just how often and how
much does your Pom need to eat? This section tells all.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
126
Making your own?
Many owners have decided that, if they can cook for themselves and survive, they
can cook for their dogs, too. (Or not cook, in the case of raw diets.) Raw-diet pro-
ponents point out that you never see a wolf cooking his catch over a campfire, so
why should a dog eat cooked food? Several dog books now list bones and raw food
(or BARF) diet ingredients. Unfortunately, many people who go this route forego the
books’ wisdom and adopt a watered-down version of the diets. For example, they
choose a diet that’s exclusively raw chicken wings, which is neither natural nor
balanced.
Critics of raw feeding point out that you should just toss your dog an intact carcass,
complete with fur, head, and guts if you really want to go au natural. After all, they
argue, buying chicken parts from the grocery store isn’t exactly the way wolves do
it in the wild either. Nevertheless, even true BARFists don’t care to plunk a dead
bunny in a bowl. The kids react badly.
The few controlled studies on the nutritional value of common raw diets show that
most of these diets lack important nutrients. Many of the diets contain salmonella
and E. coli. Although dogs are more resistant to illness from these bacteria than
people are, dogs aren’t immune, and dog studies have implicated raw feeding in
several serious cases of food poisoning.
Some owners prefer to cook their dog’s food. This cooking actually makes some
nutrients more available and certainly lessens the chance of food poisoning. A
Pomeranian owner can easily make a week’s supply of food all at one time and
freeze it. A few appropriate recipes are available in Dog Health & Nutrition For
Dummies (Wiley).

Starting and sticking
to a feeding routine
How often your dog eats depends in part on his age. Because tiny
dogs, especially tiny puppies, are prone to hypoglycemia (refer to
the earlier section “Watching out for low blood sugar”), you need
to feed your Pom puppy lots of small meals. In fact, many breeders
advocate free-feeding (leaving a bowl of dry food down at all times)
until the age of 6 months. If you prefer to feed separate meals,
follow the guidelines in Table 8-1.
Table 8-1
Feeding Schedule by Age
Age
Frequency of Feeding
0–3 months old
At least five times a day
3–6 months old
Four times a day
6–12 months old
Three times a day
1 year and older
Twice a day 
Although commercial dog foods often display recommended feed-
ing amounts on their bags or cans, consider those amounts as only
a starting point. How much to feed your Pom depends on her size,
her activity level, her individual metabolism, and the surrounding
temperature.
Your dog is still the best gauge of how many calories he needs. You
should be able to feel his ribs slightly, and he shouldn’t have a roll
of fat over his shoulders or rump. Just like you, he should have an
hourglass figure. Keeping track of his body shape is a lot easier
than computing calories!
Dieting your pudgy Pom
Poms can get away with hiding all sorts of weight problems under
their lush coats, so you need to get in there and feel your dog’s
body beneath the coat. In doing a chub check, consider the follow-
ing guidelines:
 You should be able to feel your Pom’s ribs slightly when you
run your hands along the ribcage.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 127

 You should also be able to feel a waistline from above and
from the side.
 Your Pom shouldn’t have a dimple in front of the tail or a fat
roll on the withers.
Keep track of his healthy weight. Remember, a gain of just 1 pound
is significant in a dog that should only weigh 6 or so pounds! It’s the
same as a 120-pound person gaining 20 pounds!
If your fat Pom is simply fat from overeating, you need to dish out
some tough love. You can try feeding smaller portions of a lower-
calorie food. Commercially available diet foods supply about 15
percent fewer calories compared to standard foods. Protein levels
should remain moderate to high, at least 25 percent calculated on
a dry-matter basis (see “Reading the label and between the lines”
earlier in this chapter to see how to calculate this) to avoid muscle
loss when dieting.
If your dog eats a prescription (special diet) canned food but seems
tired of it, try refrigerating the food so it holds its shape. Then cut
the chilled food into thin slices, place the slices on a cookie sheet,
and bake at a moderate temperature (350 degrees) until they’re
crisp — or the smoke alarm goes off. Voila! Prescription dog treats!
Who can resist those pleading Pom peepers when it comes to
treats? Substitute baby carrot sticks, broccoli, pea pods, or rice
cakes for fattening treats. Mix some green beans in her dinner.
Keep her away when you’re preparing or eating human meals, and,
instead of feeding her your leftovers, make a habit of taking her for
a walk.
Sometimes a dog that looks fat actually has a medical problem
such as heart disease, Cushing’s disease, hypothyroidism, or the
early stages of diabetes. A bloated belly in a puppy may signal
internal parasites. And a dog with an enlarged abdomen is espe-
cially suspect. For these reasons, always get a health check before
subjecting your little guy to a diet — which may be the last thing a
sick dog needs. Your veterinarian can also supply you with healthy
diet dog food.
Enticing your picky Pom
Older puppies often go through a poor appetite stage between 9
and 12 months of age. Stress can also cause a reduction in appetite.
But, if you can feel every rib, if the bones in the spine are sticking
up like a dinosaur’s, or if the hipbones remind you of an old cow,
your Pom is way too thin. You need to have your veterinarian
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
128

examine your skinny Pomeranian. Unexplained weight loss can be
caused by heart disease, cancer, and any number of endocrine
problems. If she checks out normal, try one of these strategies to
beef her up:
 Feed her more meals of a higher-calorie food.
 Add canned food, ground beef, or a small amount of
chicken fat.
 Heat the food to increase its appeal.
 Add a late-night snack; many dogs seem to have their best
appetites late at night.
Sick dogs often lose their appetites, yet eating can be critical for
them. And eating anything is usually better than eating nothing,
even if it’s not ideal for their condition. The following are a few sug-
gestions that just may do the trick:
 Feed the reluctant eater meat baby food.
 Keep the food cold for nauseous dogs (don’t warm it).
 Put baby food in a syringe (no needles!) for extreme cases and
squirt a tiny bit in his mouth to get him started.
 Give him canned goat’s milk or a high-calorie drink for
humans through a syringe.
Of course, sometimes your picky Pom is just being persnickety.
He’s learned to play the starving-dog you-can’t-honestly-expect-me-
to-eat-dog-food routine in order to get you to dish your own dinner
into his bowl.
Don’t fall for it. Let him stare at his full bowl while you finish eating
your dinner, put the leftovers away, and go about your business. If
he’s truly skinny or sick, of course, you have to give in. But if he’s
the typical plotting Pom, you may have to wait him out. After he’s
eaten his food, then you can give him some table scraps as a treat.
Feeding to Feel Better: Special
Diets for Diseases
Most dog foods are formulated for typical dogs with typical health.
But for some dogs with some health problems, these foods aren’t
the best diet. For these dogs, the right diet literally becomes a life-
or-death situation. Take heart: With certain foods, you can make
your sick dog feel much better and live much longer.
Chapter 8: Eating Out of the Pom of Your Hand 129

You can get foods specially formulated for various conditions from
your veterinarian. Some dogs tire of these foods, especially if they
started eating the new food when they didn’t feel well. The reason
for this rejection is that the dog can actually associate the new
food with feeling nauseous; as a result, she mistakenly develops an
aversion to that food.
Try not to introduce the new food when your dog is really sick. If
your Pom does decide he hates the commercially available food,
your veterinarian can supply special diets that you can prepare at
home. By understanding which ingredients you must avoid with a
particular illness, you may be able to include some treats in the
diet as well.

C
an you imagine having a child and not bothering to brush her
hair, give her a bath, or brush her teeth? Nobody would want
to be around her, she’d feel awful about herself, and people would
talk about you — and not in a good way. Taking good care of your
dog makes sense for all the same reasons — not to mention that a
clean dog is more enticing than a stinky one for you to hold,
cuddle, and love.
This chapter covers all the steps for keeping your Pom gorgeous
(or handsome as the case may be). Necessities such as caring for
the hair, eyes, ears, teeth, and nails are clearly laid out for you. I
even throw in some tips to take your Pom from ordinary (like that
could ever be the case!) to extraordinary in a few quick moves.
Perfecting the Pom-Padour
One of the pleasures of sharing your life with a Pomeranian is
being able to show him off in public. Few people can resist raving
over a Pomeranian pom-pom. But if your dog looks more like a tiny
tumbleweed, get out the grooming box and give your dog a new ’do.
As I mention in Chapter 5, a grooming table is a luxury you’ll love,
but if you want to spare the expense, simply place a towel in your
lap and groom your dog there. Make sure both of you have a com-
fortable place for the grooming project. Otherwise neither of you
will want to stay long.

Brushing the puff
The Pomeranian’s long, puffy coat is a combination of a long,
coarse guard coat (the coat you mostly see) and a dense, wooly
undercoat that allows the guard hairs to stand off the body. You
can easily drag a brush over the outer guard coat to make your
Pom look quite presentable, but the undercoat, if left unbrushed,
weaves itself into an impenetrable mat of feltlike hair. So, to pro-
vide a good Pomeranian grooming, direct most of your attention to
the undercoat, the part you don’t really see.
Knowing how often to brush
In an ideal world, you’d brush your dog every day, perhaps while
watching a favorite television show or just as a scheduled relax-
ation time. Your world may not be ideal, but don’t despair; you can
achieve excellent results by brushing every other day. However,
waiting longer than that can create problems.
Shed hair has to go somewhere. It can get tangled in the other coat
to form frightening mats, or it can ball together into tumbleweeds
that bounce down your hallways, or it can cling to everything from
your furniture to your clothes. The only other choice is for your
brush and comb to catch it, which explains the need for daily
grooming during shedding season. Brushing your dog every day
cuts down on the amount of hair that decorates your home and
clothing.
Getting the technique down
When you’re ready to brush, have your Pom lie down and relax. At
first, when you’re teaching your puppy to let you groom her, just
groom tiny areas, maybe her neck in the morning, her belly at
noon, her legs in the evening, and her back at night. Each time,
hand out treats like a politician hands out promises. With more
experience, you can expand the areas you brush in one sitting, ask
her to change position from one side to the other, and even have
her stand for a while. Just keep doling out the treats!
Professional groomers, and especially show-Pom groomers, can’t
imagine brushing a Pomeranian coat without first misting the coat
using a spritzer bottle of water (or water with just the slightest bit
of conditioner — see Chapter 5 for more on grooming supplies).
The goal isn’t to wet the hair but to make the air around it humid.
Brushing a dry coat in dry air causes static electricity, which in
turn causes coat breakage.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
132

If you’re trying to grow a long coat, avoid brushing it when it’s
dirty because the hair can break. If you must brush it when dirty,
be very careful, and brush as little as you can get away with; wash
him immediately, and then brush him again when clean. Never
wash a matted coat (see the section “Rats, those maddening mats!”
later in this chapter).
In order to brush the undercoat, follow these steps:
1. Part the hair with your hands so you can see the skin;
then spritz the air above it so the mist falls on the coat.
2. Use a bristle brush or a pin brush and gently brush from
the skin out (see Figure 9-1).
Figure 9-1: Brushing out the coat in layers.
3. Make the next part close enough to the first so that you
don’t miss any hair between parts.
4. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 in every area that has long hair.
5. Using your fingers and then a comb, make sure you
didn’t miss any tangles or mats on his body.
If your Pom has a lot of undercoat or is shedding, whip out the
slicker brush, a wicked-looking brush and — keep in mind — a
wicked-acting brush. If you drag it through the coat with a heavy
hand and stiff wrist, you’re likely to pull out a lot more coat than
you planned. Instead, use it gently with a loose wrist, working on
small sections at a time.
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 133

Rats, those maddening mats!
Mats happen! Hair that’s dirty, ignored, chewed, scratched, or in a
friction area is likely to mat. Areas with soft, fine hair are even
more vulnerable, and the armpits, between the hind legs, and
behind and below the ears usually mat first.
Deal with isolated mats by brushing or cutting. But be aware that
your dog may end up looking moth-eaten if you keep cutting out
mats. Always try to get rid of the mats first by brushing.
Brushing away mats
When you find a big mat, you doubt whether it can turn into pretty
hair again. But like all big jobs, you just have to break it into
smaller jobs. You may need to tackle it in several sections, mostly
to give your dog a break. And while you’re persevering, repeat over
and over, “I could have prevented this with a few minutes of
grooming.”
Now get started. Use a slicker brush to lightly brush the outer sur-
face of the mat, working your way in. Always brush the hair out of
the mat, not the mat out of the hair.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
134
Shedding misconceptions
A Pomeranian in shedding season looks just like a dandelion in a strong wind.
Because shedding is controlled in part by changes in light, most natural shedding
occurs as the days get longer. But because modern dogs live in our homes with
year-round artificial lighting, they shed somewhat all year. However, they still tend
to have more intense shedding periods in the spring and, for some reason, fall. Note:
Females also shed following their seasons and especially after whelping puppies
(they go practically bald!). During those periods of intense shedding, your house
may look like it’s in a snow flurry.
Puppies shed parts of their coat at different ages:
 At about 14 weeks of age, the face starts looking slick; this stage lasts about
three weeks.
 Around 4 to 5 months of age, its hair starts falling out in a stripe down the back.
The shedding continues until an adult coat replaces the puppy coat.
Because the puppy tends to shed unevenly and can look so scraggly, you may
start to think your puppy’s a mixed breed or has caught some terrible coat dis-
ease. Don’t worry. Unless bare skin is showing, this is the normal puppy shed.
 About 9 or 10 months of age, your naked Pom blossoms into a powder puff.

Try working cornstarch into the mat to help you pull it apart. Or
soak the mat in a hair-detangler liquid (human or pet products
work fine). Don’t use cornstarch and detangler because you’ll coat
the mat in a muddy paste.
If you’ve previously missed brushing down to the skin, your Pom
probably has extensive areas of matting. The result is known as
felting because the undercoat actually binds itself into such large
areas of feltlike material that you can’t even find the skin.
Don’t try to de-mat a felted dog. It’s far too painful for the dog, and
this is no time for you to experiment. Instead, take her to a profes-
sional groomer who will shave her. The skin under a felted coat is
very likely damaged, so your Pom may have large areas of irritated
or even raw skin. For this reason, you may have to sign a release
before a professional groomer agrees to tackle the job.
Cutting out mats
If you have a big mat attached by only a few hairs, you can snip it
out. But when a big mat is attached close to the skin by a lot of
hair, you may end up cutting your dog. To avoid this problem, try
wriggling a comb between the mat and skin so the comb acts as a
shield for the skin when you come at it with the scissors. Even
better, use a small, rechargeable electric clipper that is almost
silent. It’s safer to use than scissors, and most dogs don’t object.
After the cut, use thinning shears on the area to avoid an unattrac-
tive straight-line cut.
You can also try cutting the mat lengthwise into several smaller
mats, and then work on each of the small mats. You can wedge a
comb between the mat and the skin to avoid cutting skin. A mat-
breaking tool combs and cuts at the same time, breaking large
mats into small ones.
Bathing beauties
A clean coat smells and feels better. And because dirt and oil form
the foundation of mats, a clean coat’s also less apt to develop them.
Most groomers advocate washing a Pomeranian at least once a
month.
Bathe your Pom only when you have time to dry her thoroughly.
Never let her run around in the cold with even a damp coat. Her
small size makes her susceptible to chilling, and her thick coat
takes a long time to dry on its own. Even in warm weather, her coat
is so thick that her skin stays moist, providing, unfortunately, a
great environment for flourishing skin problems.
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 135

Some Pom owners stick cotton balls in their dogs’ ears to try to
prevent water from getting in them, but this trick usually just leads
to ears with sopping-wet cotton balls in them. A better idea: Just
be careful around the ears. If water does get in them, use a drying
agent, such as drops for swimmer’s ear. (The Pom’s upright ears
usually allow plenty of drying without such aids.) Don’t put
powder in them because it can turn into a muddy paste.
Brush your Pom thoroughly before you bathe him. Your aim is to
remove as much loose hair as possible because wet hair tends
to mat. Loosen the dead hair by sprinkling it with baby powder
before brushing. Then when you bathe your Pom, you also remove
the powder.
Bathing a tiny Pom in a big bathtub is possible, but it’s hard on
your back. It’s easier to bathe your little dog in a sink with a hand
sprayer. Take these precautions:
 Place a nonslip pad in the bottom (a towel works too).
 Put a strainer over the drain so it doesn’t get clogged
with hair.
 Make sure your Pom can’t accidentally bump a handle and
turn the hot water up without you noticing.
Many male Pomeranians have bad aim and manage to get urine on
a front leg when urinating. Rather than giving your Pom a full bath
each time he prances in the door with a pee-leg, keep a spray
bottle of rinse-free shampoo and a washcloth close at hand.
Picking the right shampoo (and conditioner)
Put down your people-shampoo bottle and step away from the
Pom! Your Pomeranian’s skin has a pH of 7.0, and your people
shampoo is formulated for a pH of 5.5. Using a shampoo made for
more acidic hair can eventually dry the Pom’s hair and skin.
You can’t judge a shampoo by its suds. Sometimes more suds
simply mean more residue. Because shampoo interacts with your
water’s hardness, no single brand is best for all Pomeranians. Keep
in mind these special shampoo needs:
 Color-enhancing shampoos can make whites brighter, oranges
more vibrant, and blacks deeper.
 Texturizing shampoos can add body to an overly limp coat.
 Oatmeal-based shampoos can help soothe itchy skin.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
136

 Tar-based shampoos can help cut greasy scaling.
 Antimicrobial shampoos can help heal damaged skin.
 Rinse-free shampoos can spot-clean your Pom without rinsing.
 Flea shampoos can kill fleas, but most nonflea shampoos also
kill them.
As for conditioners, you want one that maintains body so your Pom
stays poofy. Adding too much conditioner just makes the coat hang.
Washing your soggy princess
When you bathe your little love muffin, follow a protocol to make
sure you get her as clean as a whistle (and keep yourself clean and
dry in the process). These steps can guide you:
1. Wet the dog down to the skin with warm water, starting
just behind the head and working from front to back.
Save the head for last. Use a sponge for her face.
Holding her ears and holding the nozzle very close to her
skin may cut down on how often she shakes water all
over you.
2. Gently massage shampoo all over her body, making sure
it reaches down to the skin.
If you mix one part shampoo to ten parts water, it’s easier
to apply, lasts longer (saving you a little money!), and still
gets your Pom clean.
3. Rinse until the water runs clear, this time starting with
the face and working back and down to the feet and tail.
4. Shampoo and rinse again as an optional step.
This is the best way to get your dog really clean.
Shampoo left in the coat can cause dry skin and itching. As an
optional step, you can use a doggie conditioner to help alleviate
dry skin, but again, you must rinse it thoroughly. Experiment with
various types because some can leave your Pom’s hair too limp.
Remember, a little goes a long way.
A Pom’s eyes don’t need special attention; just be careful when
bathing and rinsing around them. You can use tearless or soap-free
shampoo made for dogs, but eye ointments tend to trap irritants
and prevent the dog’s tears from cleansing the eyes.
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 137

Drying your doused dog
Quick! Close the door! When you’ve finished rinsing, put your 
Pom in a safe place, step back, and let him shake. His next plan
will be to run amok like a crazed animal escaped from the zoo.
(That’s why you shut the door!) But don’t let him run on slick 
surfaces where he can slip and hurt himself. If you let him do this
outside, he’ll just end up looking like a mud ball and you’ll have to
start over.
When he’s finished shaking and you have him under control, use
your hands to squeeze the excess water from his coat. Next, towel-
dry him, taking care not to rub so vigorously that you create tangles.
The best way to dry your Pomeranian is with a blow dryer, prefer-
ably using a no-heat forced-air dryer. Note: Your own blow dryer
relies on blowing heated air to dry your hair. A forced-air dryer
blows unheated air at high velocity. It dries faster and with less
chance of burning your dog’s skin, but it does cost more. If you do
use a hot-air dryer, set it at the lowest possible temperature and be
very careful that you don’t overheat the skin or hair.
For best results, follow these steps to dry your Pom:
1. Give her an overall drying until the coat is damp rather
than wet.
You can use a towel for this step.
2. Have her lie down so you can focus on more thorough
drying efforts; part the hair just as you did when brush-
ing (see the earlier section “Getting the technique
down”) so the blow dryer’s air reaches to the skin.
Continue with this step until all the hair is almost dry.
3. Dry her the rest of the way, starting at the rear and blow-
ing the hair forward, brushing slightly so the hair fans out.
The hair shouldn’t have any parts in it when you’re done.
4. Comb through the hair with a coarse, then medium-
toothed comb for the final touch.
Some owners put their wet Pom in a crate and aim a fixed hot-air
blow dryer at her. Do not do this! Countless dogs have been killed
because their owners too often forget them — the hapless dogs
can’t escape the heat. This is a dangerous way to save you a little
effort.

Trimming those tresses
The truth is that you don’t need to trim your Pom unless you want
him to look like a show dog. Even then, the Pomeranian standard
only allows for “trimming for neatness and a clean outline.”
Grooming a show Pomeranian means judicious trimming well
ahead of a show so that the shaped coat grows back looking
entirely natural. Of course, you may opt for a cute clip to beat the
summer heat or just to cut down on grooming.
Ears
Neaten up the ears so that scraggly hair doesn’t frame them. If you
want that show dog look, you can round the tips, which naturally
grow to a point. Consider the following suggestions:
1. The easiest way to trim is by running your thumb up the
inside of the ear to the very end of the ear leather (the
skin) and a tiny bit beyond (for safety).
2. Use small scissors to cut around your thumb for a
rounded look. Don’t miss!
If you do accidentally slip, be forewarned that ears bleed a lot! Use
styptic powder to stop the bleeding. Severe cuts may have you
heading to the veterinarian for sutures. If this happens, maybe
leave this step to a groomer next time.
The ears normally poke up from the rest of the coat, but if the rest
of the coat is too long, the ears may be invisible. You can ignore
this detail or you can use thinning shears to shorten the coat in
that area.
Feet
You can also tidy the feet so they almost form little columns, but
with the feet clearly visible. Here are some suggestions:
 Trim the feet by cutting in a circle around the bottom of the
foot (the pads); then flip the foot up and trim all the hair so
it’s flush with the foot.
 Cut down on mud and dirt that your Pom tracks in your house
by trimming
• Behind the front foot up to the stop pad (the rounded
knob behind the wrist, technically called the meta-
carpal pad)
• Behind the rear foot up to the hock (the first joint)
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 139

Rear
Trimming around the anus lessens the chance of feces getting
caught in the coat. Two suggestions are as follows:
 Using your thinning shears, carefully cut in the direction of
hair growth all around the anus.
 Raise the tail so it’s over the back, and then trim away excess
hair at the base of the tail.
Note: If you’re trimming for a show look, the entire rear of the dog
is almost flat. But this is a job for an experienced show groomer!
Clipping the coat for
function or style
The time may come when you just don’t want to fool with all that
coat. In this case, clipping your Pom is a far better alternative than
letting him mat. If you do decide on a clip job, use a professional.
Your dog will look better, and there’s no chance that you’ll mangle
her or her fur.
If you’re just clipping your dog in order to keep her cool in
summer, try combing out the undercoat as much as possible
instead. This thick undercoat (not the longer guard hairs) traps
body heat. Combing it out may be enough to keep your Pom feeling
as cool as he looks.
Professional groomers can suggest a variety of cute haircuts that
simplify your grooming time. For example, the lion cut leaves the
front half of the body fairly long and natural, but the rear half, from
the last rib back, is short.
You can also have your dog cut short all over. This shaved do takes
about a year to grow back to its former length. Some groomers cau-
tion, however, that cutting the hair too short can actually damage
the hair follicle so it never grows back right again.
Cleaning Your Pom’s Peepers
All Poms have some eye tearing or crusty eye goo, so tear-staining
is pretty common, especially on light-colored Poms. Staining is not
caused by eating certain foods. The orange stain contains an iron
substance that’s excreted in tears, saliva, and urine, which explains
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
140

an orange area that she may get around her lips or any area she
licks a lot. Exposure to sunlight makes it worse. To minimize the
problem, do the following:
 Wipe the stain daily with a moist tissue.
 Give antibiotics in low doses to block the staining. (You can
get these meds from the vet.)
In addition, some people advocate
 Giving only distilled water
 Giving vitamin C
 Using eye-moisturizing drops
As a first step, however, your veterinarian should check her for an
eyelid or lash problem that could be irritating her eye or blocking a
tear duct. Sometimes a simple surgery can fix the problem.
If your dog has severe staining, especially if he’s a light color, you
can apply a homemade stain remover taking these steps:
1. Mix one part hydrogen peroxide, one part cornstarch,
and one part milk of magnesia.
2. Apply the mixture very carefully to the stained area with
a cotton swab, making sure it doesn’t get in the eye.
3. Let the area dry; then, holding the eye closed, carefully
brush the mixture off using a small, soft toothbrush.
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 for optimal results.
This procedure is something you’d do for special occasions or
when the stain just gets too bad. Otherwise, the mixture eventually
dries the hair.
Clearing the Hearing:
Getting the Wax Out
Peer down into your dog’s ears every week. A little bit of wax is
normal, even desirable, because it serves a protective function.
Overzealous cleaning (digging down with cotton swabs and
scratching the delicate lining) can actually contribute to ear prob-
lems by creating a foothold for bacteria.
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 141

If you see dark gunk, use an ear-cleaning solution from your veteri-
narian or simple mineral oil (although it’s a little messy). To use
the solution:
1. Squirt the ear flush solution quickly into the ear.
The slower the liquid goes in, the more it tickles.
2. Gently massage the liquid around the base of the ear
(see Figure 9-2).
3. Let go and stand back while your dog shakes.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3.
Carefully swab out the ear, taking care not to pack debris down the
canal or irritate the ear lining. If the ear is especially dirty, it may
need veterinary attention (see Chapter 11).
Figure 9-2: Massaging your Pom’s ear to make cleaning easier.
Brushing Up on Tooth Care
Fact: Little mouths tend to have big dental problems. To give your
Pom’s teeth the best care, you need to know the most common
problems and how to solve them. You also want to maintain good
dental practices for your Pom.
Caring for the pearly whites
You wouldn’t think of going days, weeks, months, or even years
without brushing your teeth. Nor would you expect to eat a hard
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
142

cracker in place of brushing your teeth. Poms are the same. If you
let food remain along the gum line, it feeds bacteria that produce
plaque, a gluelike substance. When minerals from food, water, and
saliva collect on the plaque, it turns to a cementlike compound
commonly known as tartar (but veterinarians like to call it calculus).
The plaque spreads rootward, causing irreversible periodontal dis-
ease with tissue, bone, and tooth loss. The bacteria gains an inlet
to the bloodstream, where it can cause kidney and heart valve
infections.
Although many Poms start losing their adult teeth at a very early
age, you can help save your dog’s teeth by being vigilant about her
dental care — beginning in puppyhood — as you teach your Pom
to enjoy getting her teeth brushed. You can use a soft-bristle tooth-
brush and meat-flavored doggy toothpaste.
Because dogs don’t spit, the foaming agents in human toothpaste
can make them feel sick when they swallow it, and the high sodium
content of baking powder is unhealthy for dogs. Besides, how
many people toothpastes are meat-flavored? Make a habit of brush-
ing your Pom’s teeth a little once a day. Many veterinarians believe
that regular tooth brushing may be the number-one health preven-
tative you can do for your Pom.
Hard, crunchy foods can help reduce plaque, but they don’t take
the place of brushing. If tartar accumulates, your Pomeranian may
need a thorough cleaning under anesthesia. Check the teeth, espe-
cially the upper ones at the back of the mouth. If they have a line of
tartar around the gums, or if the gums are rimmed in red at the
gum line, they need cleaning (see Figure 9-3).
Figure 9-3: Healthy teeth and gums (a) versus unhealthy teeth and gums (b).

Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 143

Inspecting your Pom 
for dental problems
In the correct Pomeranian bite, the top incisors (the little front
teeth) fit just in front of the bottom ones. However, a Pom’s teeth
are comparatively large for their mouth and can be crowded or
have somewhat shallow roots. Crowded teeth can affect the bite,
which in turn affects dental health.
In a related problem, Pomeranians normally shed their baby teeth
between 4 and 7 months of age, but some of these teeth (particu-
larly the canines) tend to stick around. As a result, the permanent
teeth grow in alongside them and may be displaced. This situation
is okay for a few days. If it persists for a week or more, ask your
veterinarian whether the baby tooth needs to go so it doesn’t per-
manently affect the bite.
Likewise, some toy dogs never get all of their permanent teeth. So,
before having baby teeth pulled for any reason:
 Have your veterinarian make sure (usually with an X-ray) that
a permanent tooth is ready to take its place.
 Be sure that a permanent tooth isn’t mistaken for a baby
tooth. Pom teeth can be so small that sometimes it’s hard to
tell the difference!
Giving Your Pom a Pedicure
For Poms, having their nails just so is about more than beauty.
Nails that grow too long can get pulled from the nail bed if they get
caught in carpet loops. And dew claws (those rudimentary thumbs
on the wrists) are especially prone to getting caught and ripped
out. As they grow back, these claws can even loop back into the
leg. Regular nails that are overly long can push against the ground
with every step, splaying apart the toes and causing discomfort.
Ideally, cut your Pom’s nails every other week but at least once a
month. Unfortunately, some dogs think they’re losing their toes as
well as their nails. To convince your Pom that this ordeal is worth-
while, heap on the treats after you cut each nail. If you use this
reward from the time he’s a puppy and avoid cutting the quick,
your Pom will be wishing he had more toes.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
144

Follow these guidelines for a painless pedicure:
 Use sharp, small nail clippers; even those for cats work well
with Poms. A nail file also works to shorten these tiny nails.
Dull clippers crush the nail and hurt.
 Hold your Pom upside down in your lap (okay, try to hold him
that way!), and look at his nails (see Figure 9-4).
• If they’re light colored, you can see a pink core inside
them. That’s the quick — the part you don’t want to cut
(see Figure 9-5).
• If he has dark nails, look for where the nail suddenly gets
fatter. Stay below that point.
• If you look from the underside, you can see where the
tip of the nail is somewhat hollow. That’s the safest
place to cut without cutting too far.
Figure 9-4: How to carefully cut a Pom’s nails.
Occasionally you cut too far. It happens. The short nail stings and
bleeds, and you run around in a panic trying to make it better.
Instead of panicking, place your pup somewhere off your white 
carpets and press some styptic powder (best choice) on the nail.
Then beg his forgiveness with even more treats. In a pinch, forage
in your pantry for some flour or a wet tea bag to press over the
nail in place of styptic powder. And beg his forgiveness with even
more treats.
Chapter 9: Primping Your Pom 145

Figure 9-5: Where to cut a Pom’s nails.
Just not up to it? Take your dog to the veterinarian or a groomer
for a nail trim. Most dogs become amazingly cooperative in a
strange place with a strange person. The charge is usually fairly
nominal, maybe $5 to $10.
A Spa Day at Pom Springs
Many Pom owners prefer to have a professional primp their pre-
cious pup rather than do it themselves. An experienced groomer
can have your dog looking her best with a visit about every six
weeks. You still need to brush her several times a week, however.
Professional groomers have often graduated from dog-grooming
schools or apprenticed under experienced groomers. Many attend
grooming seminars and a few are even certified by professional
grooming associations. Although groomers may have their own
shops or work at veterinary clinics or pet supply stores, some
work from home or have mobile grooming vans that come to your
front door.
Ask for a tour of the facilities before even making an appointment.
They don’t have to be fancy, but check out the following:
 Each dog needs a clean cage or run that separates her from
the other dogs. The groomer should sanitize the cage for each
dog and clean the clipper and scissor blades with a sterilizing
solution between dogs. Otherwise bacteria and even parasites
can transfer via the cage and tools from one dog to another.
 Reliable groomers never leave dogs unsupervised on groom-
ing tables, in tubs, or inside closed cages with dryers. Dogs
left alone in these circumstances can meet with serious acci-
dents. Look for such situations on your tour, and ask the
groomer whether they use drying cages. If dogs are left unat-
tended, look for another shop.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
146

 Professional groomers don’t use drugs to sedate your dog for
grooming, although they may use a muzzle. These people are
trained to handle dogs (even old and lame ones) safely and
comfortably, but always advise them if you have special con-
cerns about your dog. If your Pom isn’t manageable, seek a
groomer who works in a veterinary clinic, where a mild seda-
tive can be given under veterinary supervision.
The groomer trims the nails, cleans the ears, brushes out the coat,
removes any mats, and bathes and dries the dog. During the bath,
the groomer may empty the anal sacs. Emptying the sacs is only
done when the dog needs it, so discuss this step with your groomer
ahead of time. Depending on your wishes, the groomer may also
clip or trim your Pom.
One important advantage of an experienced groomer is that she
may spot an abnormality that you overlooked. For example, alert
groomers are often the first to notice infected anal sacs, skin dis-
ease, parasites, dental problems, and eye or ear problems.
The cost for professional grooming varies greatly. Groomers who
work from their homes are less expensive than those with fancy
shops. Those in big cities are more expensive than those in small
towns. And of course, those with more experience and expertise
can charge more. Expect to pay from $30 to $70, with higher costs
for dogs that are matted or need clipping. Most groomers allow
you to drop your dog off in the morning and pick her up after work.
A good, professional groomer will have your Pom looking gorgeous
and looking forward to her next day at the spa!

 Setting the course: Regular checkups and vaccinations
 Standing guard on your dog’s health
 Dealing with worms and pests
 Making life simple for you and your Pom: Castration and spaying
 Easing your Pom into senior-citizenship
You are your dog’s single most important healthcare worker
because you’re the one who sees to her everyday health and
makes vital decisions about her care. When to vaccinate? What
about worms? What’s the hurry with spaying and castration? How
can you keep your dog healthy, and how do you know when he’s
not? All of a sudden you have to play healthcare professional.
Fortunately, you have help.
Visiting the Vet: Checkups
and Vaccinations
Now is the time to get to know your Pomeranian’s other major
caretaker, his veterinarian. Don’t wait until you have an emergency
because you may have trouble getting an appointment if you’re not
already a client. Instead, establish a relationship when your dog is
healthy.
The annual rendezvous
Your Pom should have an annual checkup — at least. Dogs age so
rapidly compared to humans that an annual one is like a seven-
year checkup for you. Especially when she’s older (say, 7 years on

up) she may need more frequent checkups. So don’t procrastinate.
Besides taking your puppy’s weight, the vet normally covers the
following bases:
 Checks the knees
 Listens to her heart
 Checks the eyes, ears, and teeth
 May gently palpate her internal organs to check for enlarge-
ments or tumors
Note: You may have the option of blood or urine tests. These tests
can provide valuable early warnings of several serious disorders
and are usually a good idea. However, tests can add up in cost, so
discuss those fees beforehand. For example, a basic CBC (com-
plete blood count, which checks for anemia and infection-fighting
cells) might cost $20 to $40; one that also includes various typical
blood chemistry values may run $70 to $90. If your dog is ill, and
your vet suggests these tests, get them. If he’s not ill, discuss
whether you really need them just for baseline results.
Understanding vaccinations
Not so long ago, veterinarians generally believed that the more
vaccinations, the better. But no longer. Now veterinarians and
researchers advocate giving dogs only the vaccinations they need,
only when they need them. Makes sense, right? But what vaccina-
tions does your dog need and when?
The two main types
Vaccinations fall into two categories:
 Core vaccines: Advisable for all dogs for rabies, distemper,
parvovirus, and hepatitis (see Table 10-1)
 Noncore vaccines: Advisable only for some dogs for lep-
tospirosis, coronavirus, tracheobronchitis, Lyme disease, and
giardia
Your veterinarian can advise you whether your dog’s lifestyle and
environment make him a candidate for any of these noncore vac-
cines. For example, leptospirosis is a concern for dogs that walk in
wildlife areas. Lyme disease is a concern for dogs in certain areas
of the country. Most boarding kennels require a recent (within 6
months) tracheobronchitis (kennel cough) vaccination and core
vaccinations.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
150

The whens and whats of vaccinations
Your puppy receives her early immunity through antibodies in her
mother’s colostrum (the first 24 hours of milk flow following birth).
As long as the pup still has that immunity, vaccinations don’t do
her any good. But by the time she’s several weeks old, that initial
immunity begins to fade and she becomes more vulnerable to com-
municable diseases. Fortunately, her immune system also becomes
more responsive to vaccinations.
If all puppies lost their initial immunity at the same age and rate,
vaccinations would be easy. But because immunity diminishes at
different times in different dogs, you need to give a series of vacci-
nations starting around 6 weeks of age so you can vaccinate at just
the right time (after vaccinations become effective and before
she’s unprotected).
During this time of uncertainty, keep your pup away from places
where unvaccinated dogs may congregate. Some deadly viruses,
such as parvovirus, can remain in the soil for six months after an
infected dog has shed the virus in its feces there.

Some owners elect to test a dog’s blood titers (test to check a dog’s
level of immune defenses) to various diseases to see whether he
needs a booster. A high titer generally indicates protection, but a
low titer doesn’t mean the dog isn’t protected.
Dealing with bad reactions
Occasionally a dog has a bad reaction to a vaccination. This prob-
lem occurs most often in toy dogs, which, of course, include
Pomeranians. The dog may seem tired and sore for the next day or
two. On rare occasions, the dog may get hives or vomit. Call your
veterinarian if your pup has either of these symptoms.
In order to quickly counter a bad reaction (or to avoid one
entirely), take the following precautions:
 Give your Pom an antihistamine before she gets her shots.
Many Pom breeders suggest this. Ask your veterinarian
beforehand about the proper type and dose of antihistamine.
 Ask your veterinarian to skip the leptospirosis vaccine.
Leptospirosis, while a serious disease, is most often encoun-
tered in areas where wild animals urinate. This vaccine has
been associated with the most adverse reactions in young
dogs. You can probably put it off until later.
 Hang around the veterinary clinic for about 20 minutes fol-
lowing vaccinations. This wait time allows your dog quick
access to treatment if she experiences a reaction.
 Be sure to remind your veterinarian on subsequent visits
about any adverse reactions your dog has had to
vaccinations.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
152
Don’t hedge your bets on herd immunity
Some proponents of natural rearing condemn vaccinations; they prefer using home-
opathic nosodes (medicine prepared from the diseased part or discharge of some-
thing, which supposedly works as well as a vaccination). These people point to their
dogs’ good health as proof that nosodes work. However, their good fortune is prob-
ably the result of herd immunity, that is, as long as most other dogs are vaccinated,
the unvaccinated dogs rarely come in contact with the infectious agents.
No controlled study has ever supported the effectiveness of nosodes. Vaccinations
aren’t without a downside, but they’re essential components of your dog’s healthy
future.

Some toy dog owners believe their dogs may have bad reactions
because vaccinations aren’t given by weight. Your 5-pound Pom
gets the same amount as a 105-pound Pyrenees. But weight has
nothing to do with it. A virus infects a small dog the same way it
infects a large dog — by acting on his immune system. So a vaccine
has to act on the immune system the same way. Don’t be tempted
to vaccinate your dog yourself so you can lessen the dosage.
Playing Doctor: The Do-It-
Yourself Checkup
You plan to take your dog to the veterinarian for an annual checkup,
but that doesn’t mean you just close your eyes to her health the rest
of the year. Set aside five minutes a week — you need to groom her
that often anyway — to do a quick home health-check.
Start with some overall considerations:
 Has her behavior changed? Sudden changes could mean
she’s in pain or has some sort of neurological problem. She
needs to be seen by the vet this week.
 Does she act listless, weak, or confused? These can be signs
of pain, fever, anemia, neurological problems, or general ill-
ness. She needs to go to the vet today. Check her temperature
and gum color to report to the vet when you make the call.
 Is she limping? This could indicate knee problems (patellar
luxation) or injury. If it’s not too bad, give it a day, then go to
the vet if she’s still limping.
 Is she coughing, wheezing, or gagging? She could have
kennel cough, congestive heart failure, or tracheal collapse. If
she’s having difficulty breathing, she needs to see the vet
today.
 Is she urinating or drinking more than usual? She could
have diabetes, kidney failure, or a urinary tract infection. She
needs to see the vet this week.
 Has her appetite changed? She could have any number of
problems. Take her temperature, check her over, and if she
still has a poor appetite in a couple of days, take her to the vet.
 Has she lost or gained weight? She could have cancer, heart
disease, kidney disease, Cushing’s syndrome, or any number
of problems. Get her checked by the vet this week.
 Are her stools normal? If diarrhea continues for another day,
call the vet and ask if you should bring her in.
Chapter 10: Maintaining Your Pom’s Health and Happiness 153

Next, give her body a once-over:
 Are her bones and muscles fairly symmetrical on both
sides? Any asymmetry could indicate muscle wasting, tumors,
or broken bones. Take her to the vet this week.
 Do you feel new bumps or masses? First, don’t freak out.
Dogs are good at growing noncancerous bumps. But have it
checked out this week.
 Does she act like anything hurts? Depending on the problem,
she could have a urinary tract infection, slipped disk, or who
knows? Take her to the vet!
 Is her skin clear, without crusting or hair loss? It’s not an
emergency, but skin conditions could be caused by parasites
or infections. Take her to the vet soon.
Now start at the front and work back:
 Are her gums pink, as they should be? Pale gums indicate
anemia or internal bleeding, gray gums indicate poor circula-
tion, and gums with little red blotches indicate a potentially
serious blood-clotting problem. All of these are potential
emergencies. See the vet now!
 Are her teeth clean and secure? Dirty, loose teeth can cause
pain and additional disease. She may need an appointment for
a teeth cleaning under anesthesia.
 Are her eyes clear and without significant discharge? A bit
of clear discharge is normal, but goopy, green discharge
means irritation or infection. See the vet the next day.
 Are her ears clean? A little dirt is fine, but if they’re clogged
with debris, she may have an infection or mites. Your veteri-
narian can diagnose the problem and prescribe a cure. Go in
the next day or so.
 Are her nails short and without splits? If not, cut them! If
they’re split, you can tape them. If you can’t handle nail care
yourself, have your vet do it this week.
 Are her feet without cuts or foreign objects? Treat cuts like
you would your own, by cleaning and gobbing on antibiotic
goop. Spray a bitter-tasting spray (your vet sells this) on it to
keep her from licking it, or wrap a bandage around it. If it’s
deep, your vet may need to clean or suture it.
 Is her at-rest pulse between 70 and 120 beats per minute?
See Chapter 11 to find out how to check your dog’s pulse. If
it’s outside this range, recheck it when she’s calmer (if it’s too
fast) or call your vet.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
154

 Is her temperature around 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit?
Don’t freak out if it’s a degree higher or lower. But, if it’s down
to 98 or up to 103 degrees, call the veterinarian. If it’s below 98
or above 105 degrees, it’s an emergency. Call the emergency
veterinarian and warm or cool your dog in the meantime.
To check your dog’s temperature, hold her still with one hand,
lift her tail high and forward with the other, and have a helper
insert a lubricated rectal thermometer about an inch into her
rectum. If you’re on your own, use the same hand to hold her
and lift her tail. The digital models are easiest to use and beep
when they’re ready; otherwise, leave the thermometer in
place for about a minute.
Avoiding the Worm Farm:
Preventive Measures
A cornucopia of little bloodsuckers can live inside your dog. We
commonly refer to them as worms whether they look like worms or
not. Some are deadly, some are just nuisances, but you should aim
to prevent them all!
Heartworms
Heartworms are deadly parasites carried by mosquitoes. If your
Pom has any chance of being bitten by a mosquito, she needs to be
on preventive heartworm medication.
Your veterinarian can advise you when to start giving your pup the
medication; the recommendations vary by location. Most veteri-
narians prefer to start dogs on preventive medication before
they’re 4 months old. Dogs over 6 months of age need a simple
blood test to check for heartworms before beginning heartworm
prevention. The once-a-month preventive, which works by target-
ing heartworms at a particular life phase, is safe and effective.
Treatment is available for heartworms, but prevention is far
cheaper, easier, and safer.
Intestinal parasites
Most pups have worms at some point because some types of worms
lie dormant and protected in the dam. When a dog is pregnant and
experiences hormonal changes, the worms become active and
infect the puppies as fetuses, or through her milk. Puppies also can
pick up worms from the environment. The breeder should have
Chapter 10: Maintaining Your Pom’s Health and Happiness 155

checked and (if necessary) dewormed your pup before sending
him home with you, but it doesn’t hurt to check your Pom again on
his first checkup and periodically after that (the eggs don’t always
show up in tests).
Your dog can also pick up worms from the ground where other dogs
congregate. The best prevention at home is to clean up feces imme-
diately, but purging a yard of some kinds of worms can be difficult.
There’s one kind of worm that’s easy to spot: the tapeworm. You can
see flat segments wiggling around on your dog’s fresh stool (don’t
get too enthralled studying them or your neighbors will definitely
think you’re weird), or they may look like dry rice stuck around
your dog’s butt. Tapeworms are different from other intestinal
worms in that your dog picks them up mostly by eating fleas. Think
your dog wouldn’t eat fleas? She sure would, when she’s nibbling
at something biting her. Your veterinarian can prescribe medica-
tion to rid her of the tapeworms, but the best prevention is to keep
the fleas off.
Two other common intestinal parasites aren’t worms but protozoans
(single-celled organisms). Dogs and especially puppies pick them
up in the environment, so avoiding them is difficult.
 Giardia is fairly common in both puppies and dogs. Although
many dogs have no symptoms, some dogs with giardia tend to
have loose, light-colored stools. Giardia is diagnosed with a
stool sample and can be treated with medicine from your
veterinarian.
 Coccidia may or may not cause overt symptoms, and it’s diag-
nosed with a stool sample. Over-the-counter dewormer treat-
ments are not effective.
Preventing Bugs: Fleas,
Ticks, and Mites
Depending on your location and the season, at some point fleas
and ticks will try to make your dog’s body their breakfast — and
lunch and dinner. It’s best to keep some long-acting flea repellant,
such as the ones that are stored in the skin and wick out over the
course of a month or two, on your dog even before flea season.
If you’re in a tick-infested area, you need to apply some hands-on
care by meticulously feeling and examining your Pom’s body down
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
156

to the skin, paying special attention to the ears, neck, and between
the toes.
For more on fleas, ticks, mites, and your dog, check out Chapter 11.
Castrating and Spaying
Pomeranians begin to reach sexual maturity at about 6 months of
age. The male’s testicles begin to grow in size, and his mind turns
to thoughts of the fairer sex. The female doesn’t give you any clues
until one day you’re shocked to see her bloody vaginal discharge.
If you have both a male and female, prepare for the worst three
weeks of your life.
Knowing what to expect
At first, caring for your she-dog in heat doesn’t seem so bad. She’s
messy, but you can keep her confined or have her wear those little
bitch’s britches for dogs in heat. Of course, she needs to urinate
more often when she’s in season just so she can advertise her beau-
tiful scent, and of course, she does it in those pretty little britches,
so you’d better buy several sets. The males are sort of interested,
but not much. In fact, you may start thinking your girl lacks sex
appeal. This is the phase meant to lull you into complacency.
Somewhere in the second or third week, her scent changes. Males
find her the most alluring creature to ever walk the earth, and they
howl, dig, whine, and travel great distances to woo her. Your chaste
little girl is suddenly acting like a harlot, and you’re counting the
days until your personal time in purgatory ends. Great news! In six
months, you can expect it to happen all over again.
Lowering the sexual zest
You can nip (or snip) the promiscuity of your Pom in the bud by
castrating your male or spaying your female. But the advantage to
doing this before your dog reaches sexual maturity depends on the
sex of the dog:
 Male: When a male reaches sexual maturity, he starts to lift
his leg when urinating in order to mark objects in his territory,
which include your furniture. He may also become more
aggressive toward other dogs. The longer he practices these
behaviors, the more likely they’ll persist after neutering.
Chapter 10: Maintaining Your Pom’s Health and Happiness 157

 Female: The advantage to spaying a female before her first
season is medical rather than behavioral. Spaying before her
first heat season drastically reduces her chance of breast
cancer later in life. Spaying before her second season helps,
too, but not as much, and after that season, spaying has little
benefit against breast cancer. Spaying at any time eliminates
the possibility of pyometra, a potentially fatal infection of the
uterus that’s common in dogs.
The best age to castrate or spay is around 5 or 6 months. This
timing gives your Pomeranian a chance to grow, making surgery a
little easier. Because toy dogs often retain baby teeth alongside
their permanent teeth, the surgery also provides an opportunity
for the veterinarian to remove those teeth.
Addressing thoughts of breeding
Breeding tiny dogs is not for the inexperienced and, in fact, has
several disadvantages:
 A Caesarean delivery is likely.
 Serious postnatal complications such as eclampsia (a poten-
tially fatal condition of the dam) are likely.
 Litters are small, so don’t count on raking in the bucks by sell-
ing lots of puppies.
 The requirements of a good breeder, which I discuss in
Chapter 3, are stringent. Ask yourself these questions:
• Can you meet the requirements?
• Have you had the necessary health clearances per-
formed on the potential sire and dam?
• Has she proven herself in an objective competition to be
of better-than-average quality?
Unless you’re adamant about wanting to breed your Pom, you’re
safe to go forward with the castration or spaying.
Good Pomeranian breeders screen for hereditary defects, prove
their dogs in some form of competition, educate themselves, and
stand by their puppies for a lifetime. They often require that buyers
neuter or spay their dogs (either by giving a partial refund when
they do, withholding full ownership until they do, or registering
the dog with a Limited Registration, so any puppies from it can’t be
registered) because they know too well the problems that poor
dog breeding can create.

Giving Your Pom a Chip
on His Shoulder
One preventive veterinary measure you’ll want to take is prevent-
ing your Pom from becoming lost. Besides taking all the normal
precautions, such as not letting him roam, keeping your fence
secure, and having him wear a license, there’s one measure your
veterinarian can help with: a microchip.
A microchip is about the size of a grain of rice and is inserted just
above the shoulders, beneath the dog’s skin, with an injection. Now,
it takes a big needle to inject something this size, so I advise waiting
until you have your dog spayed or castrated so she won’t feel it.
Otherwise she’ll probably wince and may yip, but she’ll get over it.
The microchip transmits a number when a special reader is passed
over it. This number can then be traced to you. Animal shelters
check dogs for microchips when they come in and have reunited
many lost pets with their families because of them.
Keeping Your Senior Pom Healthy
With the help of good care, good genes, and good luck, your
Pomeranian will be with you for many years. He’ll mature gradually
from perky pup to competent companion, getting better all the
time. But one day, maybe when he’s anywhere from 8 to 12 years
old, you’ll notice that he’s matured into a senior citizen, a stage
that many Pomeranian owners contend is nonetheless the best time
of all. But a Pom pensioner needs you to take special precautions
to help him stay healthy and happy.
Eating and the elderly Pom
Older Poms need several small meals a day. If your grand Pom has
tooth loss or other dental problems, you may need to feed her
mushy foods. Both physical activity and metabolic rates slow in
older dogs, so they tend to need fewer calories. And just like with
humans, excessive weight can place a burden on the heart and
joints. However, because very old dogs tend to lose weight, at some
point you may find you’re trying to keep your dog’s weight on,
not off.
Chapter 10: Maintaining Your Pom’s Health and Happiness 159

Most older dogs don’t require a special diet unless they have a 
special medical condition (see Chapter 11). Moderate amounts of
high-quality protein, such as those found in dog foods formulated
for seniors, are especially important for seniors.
Coping with senior sensory problems
Older dogs, like older people, may experience sensory or cognitive
losses. Fortunately, dogs deal well with these changes — better
than most people do.
Vision loss
As your dog ages, you’ll start to notice a slight haziness in the
pupils (black part) of his eyes. That change is normal and doesn’t
affect vision that much. However, if the pupils become very gray or
even white, he probably has cataracts.
A canine ophthalmologist can remove the lens and even replace it
with an artificial lens, just like people get. Two concerns that your
veterinarian will evaluate first are
 Is he healthy enough for surgery?
 Is the retina of his eye still functioning?
Cataract surgery is expensive — anywhere from $1,000 to (gulp)
$5,000 — and entails a fair amount of aftercare, but it can make a
world of difference for your dog.
Not all vision problems can be fixed, and you may not notice his
vision is deteriorating until he’s almost blind. To help your senior
Pom get around safely, take the following precautions:
 Block dangerous places (stairways and pools).
 Don’t move your furniture unnecessarily.
 Place sound and scent beacons (such as playing radios, tick-
ing clocks, perfumed cloths, or stinky shoes that never move)
around the house and yard so he can hear and smell where
he is.
 Make pathways that he can feel with his paws (carpet runners
inside and gravel walks outside).
Many blind dogs live very happy lives.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
160

Hearing loss
Older dogs also tend to lose their hearing. The ability to hear high-
pitched sounds usually goes first, so if you notice your dog isn’t
responding to your call, try lowering the tone of your voice.
Unfortunately, dogs and hearing aids don’t mix, so your best bet is
to help her understand new ways to communicate. For example, a
dog can easily understand your simple hand signals, and she can
respond to a flashing porch light when you want her to come
inside. Also, be sure to pet your dog a lot; otherwise she’ll wonder
why you quit talking to her.
Cognitive loss
If you find your older Pom walking around aimlessly, pacing back
and forth, or standing in a corner looking like she’s stuck, she may
be suffering from cognitive dysfunction. Basically, she’s not think-
ing as clearly as she once did. Your veterinarian can prescribe a
drug (selegiline hydrochloride is the fancy name, but it goes by
Anipryl) that may help her get back to being her old self. It doesn’t
work for all dogs and may take weeks or longer to see a difference,
but in those dogs that it works for, owners report almost miracu-
lous improvements — just like her old self!
You can also help by involving her in activities and small mental
challenges, either through games or by teaching her new tricks.
If she enjoys the same games she did when she was younger (like
short games of tag or fetch), great! Just be sure not to overdo
them. She may prefer less strenuous activities, though. For exam-
ple, hide treats around the room and challenge her to find them.
Or take her for rides in the car; even though she may not be as
demanding as she used to be, she probably still enjoys getting out
and going places with you. Research has shown that these activi-
ties help ward off cognitive impairment.
Senior health concerns
Just as you start feeling more aches and pains as you age, so does
your Pom. And unfortunately, it’s not just the bones and joints that
go in older people or dogs. The heart, kidneys, and other organs
may not function like they used to, and cancer is more likely to
threaten health. This is a time when preventive health care really
can be a life saver.
Your older Pomeranian needs a veterinary checkup twice a year.
Although blood work was optional when she was younger, it’s a
necessity now. Standard blood work can tell you whether she’s suf-
fering from anemia, has elevated white blood cells (indicating
Chapter 10: Maintaining Your Pom’s Health and Happiness 161

infection), or has too few platelets (indicating a clotting disorder).
Other tests can tell you whether she has kidney failure, diabetes,
liver failure, or other major problems.
Check out the following list of more common ailments and note
how you can best respond to them:
 Arthritis: Pomeranians stay perky even into their senior
years, but you shouldn’t push the physical activities. Even if
your Pom is used to jumping on and off furniture, encourage
him to use doggy steps or a ramp (see Chapter 5). Older dogs
tend to have arthritic changes that can be made worse by
such stresses. The same is true for exercise; you don’t want
your older Pom to just lie around, but give him a soft bed
when he does. You can help your arthritic dog by walking him
a short distance (say, around the block, or less if it’s a big
block) one or more times a day.
Also, ask your veterinarian about drugs such as carprofen that
may help alleviate some of the symptoms of arthritis or even
improve the joint. Glucosamine stimulates the production
of collagen and may help rejuvenate cartilage. Chondroitin
sulfate helps to protect cartilage from destructive enzymes.
These medications are available from your veterinarian or
most drug or health-food stores.
 B.O.: Older dogs often have a stronger body odor than they
did when younger. Search for its source. The most likely
sources are the teeth, ear infections, or even kidney disease.
 Body temperature: Older dogs are more susceptible to both
chilling and overheating, so be sure you keep an eye on
whether he’s curled up and shivering or spread out and
panting.
 Dry skin: Dogs lose moisture in their skin as they age, making
them itchy. Regular brushing can stimulate oil production.
Also consider using a moisturizing conditioner when you
bathe your dog.
 Digestion problems: Vomiting or diarrhea can dehydrate and
debilitate an old dog quickly. They can also signal some seri-
ous problems such as kidney or liver failure. When he was
younger, you may have waited a day or so before you took
your dog to the veterinarian. Now that he’s older, don’t take a
wait-and-see approach. Get him to the clinic today.
 Immune system deficiency: Because the immune system is
less effective in older dogs, shielding him from infectious dis-
ease with vaccinations is now doubly important. However, if
he’s turned into a homebody, the vaccination regimen may no
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
162

longer be necessary. This decision remains controversial
among veterinarians in the field. Ask your veterinarian about
the latest guidelines.
 Tooth problems: Tooth problems are very common in older
Pomeranians. Bad breath, lip licking, reluctance to chew, and
avoidance of hands near his mouth are all signs that your dog
needs veterinary dental attention. Pulling loose teeth and
cleaning the remaining teeth can help your dog feel much
better.
In addition to the typical ailments that dogs of any age suffer, older
dogs are far more vulnerable to a number of serious disorders.
For example, heart disease, kidney disease, cancer, diabetes, and
Cushing’s syndrome (which occurs when the adrenal glands make
too much cortisol, causing a pot-bellied appearance, among other
symptoms) are all much more common in older dogs. Symptoms of
these disorders include
 Abdominal distension
 Appetite changes
 Coughing
 Diarrhea
 Increased thirst and urination
 Nasal discharge
 Weight loss
Many of these disorders can be treated successfully, especially if
caught early (see Chapter 11). For this reason, don’t ignore these
signs, especially in your older Pom. Old age, combined with small
body size, mean Poms are somewhat vulnerable when ill. If you see
any of these symptoms, get your Pom to the vet within the week;
the sooner the better.

L
iving with a pet for many years means dealing with illness —
both minor and more serious, short-term and long-term.
Unfortunately, because their life spans are so much shorter than
ours, dogs tend to rush through the stages of life, rushing also into
these illnesses at an advanced pace. But here’s the good news:
When you’re able to extend their lives by even a short time in
people terms, you’re actually extending it a long time for them.
In this chapter I show you how to recognize problems and address
many of them on your own. I also point out when to turn a problem
over to the veterinarian so you can extend your dog’s life and qual-
ity of life with the best care possible.
Saving Your Dog’s Skin
The best coat-care in the world can’t overcome skin problems.
Itchy skin or skin that’s inflamed, greasy, or smelly, as well as skin
with sores can all make your dog uncomfortable and her hair look
lousy. Knowing a bit about different skin-related issues can help
you identify and solve your dog’s skin problem.
Debugging your dog
Many people think a toy dog’s only job historically was to sit in
people’s laps and look cute. But that concept’s only half right.
Many toy breeds actually had a very important job — they were
to sit in people’s laps, look cute, and attract fleas off the people.

Chances are you didn’t add a Pomeranian to your household for
this reason. In fact, the roles have completely reversed and
expanded: Now you’re getting fleas, ticks, and mites off your dog!
Making fleas flee
Fleas are little brownish bugs that scurry under your dog’s coat
next to the skin. They can move pretty fast after you part the fur
because they’re flattened and very narrow. They also leave behind
poop that looks like black dirt and turns red if you get it wet. Fleas
make your dog itch, both when they bite and afterward, because
their saliva often causes allergic widespread reactions for days
afterward. They also transmit tapeworms. After they get into a
home or environment, fleas hang around, sometimes for months,
waiting for a warm, fuzzy host to stroll by.
Fighting fleas — the scourge of dogdom — had been a losing battle
until recently. Not so long ago you had to soak your dog, your
house, and your yard in so many poisons that it made Chernobyl
seem like a nature preserve. The time and expense added up until
some owners finally gave up.
Today the situation’s improved. Newer products available from
your veterinarian have a higher initial purchase price but are
cheaper in the long run because they work from the get-go and
need reapplication only once a month or so.
Most of these products are available only from your veterinarian,
although some discount products try to sound like they’re just as
effective. Look for a product with one of the following ingredients:
 Nitenpyram: If your Pom is covered in fleas, reach for this
oral medication that has the fleas kicking the bucket within
two minutes. Every flea is dead within four hours. The draw-
back? Nitenpyram has almost no residual activity, so it’s
mostly a quick fix for heavily infested dogs.
 Selamectin: Want something that does it all? This chemical
takes care of fleas, ear mites, and several internal parasites for
one month and acts as a heartworm preventive. But if your
dog doesn’t need all this, don’t go overboard. Opt for just
what he does need.
 Imidacloprid: Only bothered by fleas? Apply this spot-on
chemical between your Pom’s shoulder blades. It distributes
itself all over the dog’s body within a day and kills fleas for a
month. Your dog can get wet, but repeated baths will wash the
product off.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
166 Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 

 Fipronil: Are ticks also a concern? This chemical collects in
the hair follicles and wicks out over time. It kills fleas for up to
three months and ticks for a shorter time, and it’s resistant to
bathing. It’s sold as a spray or as a spot-on, a liquid applied to
the back.
 Permethrin: If fleas aren’t a big problem for your dog (for
example, you’re on a trip and just found one or two fleas), this
short-term, very safe spray may be your answer. But don’t
rely on it for anything more than a quick fix.
 Lufenuron, methoprene, or fenoxycarb: Have a flea problem
that’s spread to the house or yard? These chemicals render
fleas sterile. It doesn’t kill them though, so you’ll need some-
thing else for that. You can also spray your home and yard
with poisons, but sterilizing the fleas is generally safer for you
and your dog.
Your best bet? Use a combination of products. Fleas are building
up immunity to some of these chemicals. By alternating between
two or more of them with every application, you catch the few
fleas that were immune to the previous chemical. And don’t scrimp
on products! Use them frequently enough (once a month, in gen-
eral) and heavily enough to make sure there are no survivors!
The later section “Alleviating allergies” contains additional informa-
tion about fleas with regards to your dog’s allergic reaction to them.
Getting ticks unstuck
Ticks are fairly small parasites — some are smaller than the head
of a match, some a bit larger, especially once they’re puffed up
with your dog’s blood. They live off the blood of mammals, and
they can stick to your dog’s skin for long periods of time if you
don’t get them off. They’re harder to kill than fleas, but at least
they hold still.
The most common way to get rid of ticks on your dog is to remove
them one by one. Feel all over your Pom’s body, but especially
around the ears, neck, and between the toes for the telltale bumps.
Then use a tissue to grasp the tick as close to the dog’s skin as
possible, and pull it gently out — don’t jerk it. Even if you leave
part of it, it won’t hurt your dog.
Another way to kill ticks is with chemicals. Products containing
amitraz (usually found in tick collars) or fipronil (usually found in
sprays or spot-on applications) kill ticks. However, they don’t kill
the ticks immediately, so chemicals are typically reserved as back-
ups. Your hands are still your best tool.
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 167

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
168
Ticks are a particularly serious concern because they can transmit
several diseases such as Lyme disease, erhlichiosis, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, and babesiosis. A vaccination is available
for Lyme disease, but it’s not advisable for dogs that don’t live in
Lyme endemic areas. Your veterinarian can order blood tests if any
of these conditions are suspected — for example, if you live in an
area where one of these diseases is common, if your dog is sud-
denly lethargic, or if he has intermittent lameness.
Taking the bite out of mites
Mites are tiny bloodsuckers that can make your dog’s hair fall out. I
detail the three different types of animal mites in Table 11-1.
Alleviating allergies
When people have allergies, they tend to sneeze. But when dogs
have allergies, they tend to itch. The most common allergens for
dogs are flea saliva, pollens, dust mites, and food. A veterinary der-
matology specialist can perform intradermal (skin) testing with
common allergens but not food allergens. If the culprit is identified,
a series of injections can often help the dog overcome the allergic
reaction. A good clue: If your dog is biting at her skin, especially
her front feet, scratching at her ears, or rubbing her rump on your
furniture frequently, take her to the vet to see whether something
else could be the cause and to get temporary relief.
Flea allergies
Flea allergy dermatitis, or FAD, is the most common of all skin prob-
lems. With FAD, a dog is allergic to flea saliva, so not only does the
dog suffer from the normal itchiness due to these small critters
walking around on his skin, but he also suffers because the saliva
acts as a skin irritant. So the poor pooch reacts the only way he
can — by biting or chewing at his skin to make the irritation stop.
In a flea-allergic dog, the saliva from just one flea bite can send the
dog chewing not just around the bite but all over, especially on the
rump, legs, and paws. And this chewing often leads to crusted
bumps in these areas. The solution is simple: Get rid of every flea!
(See the section “Debugging your dog” earlier in this chapter.)
Airborne allergies
Inhaled allergens are similar to those that affect humans — pollen,
dust mites, and molds. Your dog may have a skin allergy if you see
him frequently scratching or chewing at his face, ears, feet, forelegs,
armpits, and abdomen. Because the feet are so often affected, many

people assume the problem is grass or carpet allergies, but that’s
seldom the case. It’s just that allergies from anything anywhere
tend to make the feet itchy.
Common short-term treatments include allergy pills or steroid
medication. Bathing in cool bath water with anti-itch shampoos
from your veterinarian may help. Long-term treatments including
moving to another state or getting allergy tests and injections.
Moving may be the less expensive option.
Food allergies
Food allergies can produce diarrhea or itchy skin and ears. Your
veterinarian can prescribe an elimination diet (a diet consisting of
novel proteins your dog hasn’t eaten before, such as those from
venison, duck, or rabbit). No, you don’t have to get out the gun.
These proteins are available in dry and canned foods from your vet-
erinarian. You keep the dog on the diet for at least a month, with-
holding treats or anything else that may contain a food allergen.
If the dog’s symptoms clear up, then you can add back ingredients
he has been exposed to one at a time. If and when you see a return
of the allergy symptoms, you know which one causes the problem.
You may have to keep your dog on a special diet for the rest of
his life.
If his condition doesn’t clear up, he may need to try another novel
diet or a hypoallergenic diet that has a special protein molecule
size. Some dogs’ food allergies never clear up, though.
Cooling hot spots
Hot spots, more technically known as pyotraumatic dermatitis, are
red, itchy, painful, moist spots that seem to arise overnight.
Usually something has irritated the skin, perhaps a flea bite, and
the dog scratches and chews the spot. The skin gets irritated and
moist, allowing first infection and then worse symptoms to set in.
If your Pom has hot spots, clip the hair away, prevent the dog from
chewing or scratching, and apply a treatment that both dries the
skin and kills the bacteria. (For the best results, use antibiotic
powder, which you can get over the counter for people, or even
bacteria-fighting mouthwash on the skin.) You may also need to
give your dog an oral antihistamine to stop the itching, or your vet
can prescribe steroids. (See the sidebar “Easing the itch” for more
ideas.)

Easing the itch
If your Pom is itching to scratch for any reason, you can ease the itch at home with
several treatments. Here are a few:
 Apply an ice pack or even immerse the dog in cool water. Pat dry, but avoid
blow-drying or vigorous rubbing.
 Bathe with medicated shampoo and cool water, leaving the shampoo in con-
tact with the skin for at least ten minutes; then rinse and dry thoroughly.
 Pour a little aloe vera juice on the irritated area and leave it on.
 Apply a topical nonitch spray, witch hazel, moisturizing spray, or topical steroid
medication sold for humans.
 Try to get your dog’s mind off the itch. Play some games, go for a walk, or give
a treat that requires extensive chewing or working.
 Fatty acid supplementation (fish oil, which you can buy in any drug store, is one
good source) can provide improvement over the long term. It’s effective in up to
one fourth of the cases of itchy skin, especially when used with antihistamines.
Note: Don’t confuse these supplements with those sold as food supplements to
improve coat quality.
 Your veterinarian can suggest a safe dose of antihistamines. Common human
antihistamines safe for dogs are clemastine fumarate, diphenhydramine, chlor-
pheniramine, and hydroxyzine.
Histamines don’t cause as much inflammation in dogs as they do in humans, so
antihistamines may not be as effective in dogs. Finding the most effective types
usually takes a couple of weeks of trying each one out.
Antihistamines may cause drowsiness, a desirable side effect in cases of
intense itching but not great for long-term use.
Don’t give your dog any over-the-counter antihistamines that contain other med-
ications, such as those in sinus or cold-relief medications. Talk to your veteri-
narian ahead of time to find out the correct dosage for your puppy and keep
some in the medicine chest.
If itching continues, your veterinarian may prescribe short-term oral cortisone med-
ication. This treatment provides the most immediate and effective relief and may be
necessary in order to start treating the itch.

best prevention is flea prevention (see Chapter 10). Tapeworms
may gross you out and make your dog’s butt itch, but as worms go,
they’re not terribly devastating. Still, you need to get rid of them.
Tapeworms require special deworming medication, but you don’t
need to rush to the vet. Just describe what they look like to the
receptionist, or if you’re not sure what they are, bring one in for
verification, and your vet will usually hand you some pills. Get rid
of the fleas too while you’re at it.
You may be tempted to pick up some over-the-counter deworming
medicine at the grocery store and just blast those worms away
every month. Don’t! These dewormers are neither as effective nor
as safe as those you can get from your veterinarian. By performing
a fecal check, your veterinarian can provide the best medicine for
the specific parasite.
Spotting Signs of Sickness
If only your Pom could tell you where it hurts — or whether it
hurts. Few challenges are as frustrating as determining whether
your dog’s sick, and if so, what the problem is. But when you know
what to look for, you discover your Pom’s telling you more than
you ever imagined.
Butt scooting
Your Pom may look comical doing the butt-scootin’ boogie, but it’s
no laughing matter for her. She’s trying to make her sore butt feel
better by relieving some of the pressure in her anal sacs, the two
sacs just inside and on either side of her anus.
The sacs normally contain a sticky fluid that squeezes out when
the dog defecates or occasionally squirts out, skunk-like, if she’s
suddenly alarmed. If the tiny holes in the sacs get clogged, the fluid
builds up, thickens, and expands the sacs balloon-like until they
push through the skin to the outside and then burst. To add to the
problems, the sacs become inflamed and infected. Talk about a
bad-feeling butt!
Besides scooting, your Pom may constantly lick at her anus in an
attempt to soothe it. Your veterinarian can unclog the sac and
express the fluid as a routine matter so your Pom feels better
almost immediately.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
172 Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 

Two additional problems may cause scooting:
 Tapeworms wriggling around the anus. (See the previous
section “Global Deworming” for the remedy.)
 Lower-back problems. If the anal sacs are okay and no tape-
worms are present, have your veterinarian check your Pom’s
spine.
Coughing
Everybody coughs once in a while. But if your Pom’s coughing
every day or in long bouts, that’s not normal. Your veterinarian can
do some simple tests to pinpoint the problem.
Especially in younger dogs, coughing may indicate an infectious
disease. Kennel cough is a group of highly contagious airborne 
diseases caused by several different agents, but most often by
Bordetella, a type of bacteria. Kennel cough is characterized by a
gagging cough that starts about a week after exposure.
Your veterinarian can inoculate your Pom against kennel cough,
usually with nose drops, but protection doesn’t last more than a
few months and may not cover every possible infectious agent.
Nonetheless, the inoculation is a good idea if you plan to board
your dog or if he suffers from tracheal collapse or other breathing
problems. (See the later section “Pondering Pom Predispositions”
for more on tracheal collapse.)
Coughing can also be a sign of congestive heart failure, tracheal
collapse, or even lung cancer. Because these are life-threatening
conditions, your veterinarian should check out any coughing that
persists more than a couple of days.
Diarrhea
Your little squirt can get a case of the squirts for lots of reasons:
Nerves or a change in food or water can cause short-term prob-
lems; intestinal parasites, sensitivity to certain foods, and illnesses
can cause more long-lasting diarrhea.
A little bit of blood in diarrhea is not the cause for concern in dogs
that it is in humans. Intestinal parasites such as giardia or coccidia
(see Chapter 10) can cause blood in the stool. Nonetheless, if it
continues for more than a day, or if it’s in copious amounts, you
need a veterinarian’s opinion. A Pomeranian has so few reserves
that a bout of diarrhea can seriously dehydrate her. She may need
to go to the veterinarian for intravenous fluids.
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 173

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
174
Take these steps to stop diarrhea:
1. Restrict food for a meal or two, feeding just a partial meal.
2. Offer a bland diet consisting of rice (or tapioca or cooked
macaroni) along with tofu (or nonfatty chicken) for sev-
eral days when you start to feed her again.
You want to give the intestinal tract time to heal, and it
can’t do that with fatty food encouraging more diarrhea.
Ear gunk
Pomeranians are blessed with healthy ears in part due to their
prick-ear design that lets air circulate within them. Nonetheless,
like all dogs, their ear canal has an initial vertical segment that
abruptly turns inward at a sharp angle. That sharp angle can
restrict some air flow, which encourages moisture, which in turn
nurtures bacteria and yeast. Although certain types of bacteria are
normal and harmless in the ear canal, others can grow unchecked,
causing the ear canal’s surface to react to their byproducts by
secreting oils and becoming inflamed.
Other factors contribute to ear problems:
 Allergies are the most common cause of ear problems in dogs
overall. See the section “Alleviating allergies” to determine
if this might be the problem, and what you can do to stop
the itch.
 Seborrhea causes itchiness and contributes to a heavy accu-
mulation of ear wax. Other parts of the dog may have greasy
skin and hair. Your vet may be able to diagnose and treat this.
 Parasites, such as ear mites, can also cause intense itching of
the ears. Your veterinarian can diagnose the presence of para-
sites easily and can prescribe much more effective medication
for ear mites than you can buy over the counter.
Signs of ear problems can include
 Head shaking
 Head tilt
 Scratching at the ear
 Rubbing the ear
 Smelly ear
 Dark buildup within the ear
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 

A veterinarian should examine all ear problems for the following
reasons:
 The same symptoms can result from various causes that
require different treatments.
 A perforated ear drum due to chronic problems requires med-
ication that’s different from the medication for an intact ear.
 If the ear is filled with wax and debris, it needs to be cleaned
so that antibiotic medication can reach the lining of the canal.
But if the ear is painful or the ear drum is perforated, the dog
must be sedated to clean the ear.
In most cases the veterinarian sends you home with an ear flush
solution in addition to antibiotic medication. The solution loosens
wax and debris (so the medication can reach the ear’s surface) and
has a drying agent so it doesn’t leave the ear wet — find out how
to use it in Chapter 9. To apply the medication, first clean the ear
with the solution, and then squeeze the medicated ointment or
drops into the canal, again gently massaging the base of the ear to
disperse the medicine.
Tears and eye goop
No doubt you look at those pretty Pom peepers more than any
other part of your dog. So while you’re at it, keep an eye out for
eye problems such as squinting, tearing, or mucous discharge.
These signs can indicate lid problems, foreign bodies, tear
drainage problems, or dry eyes.
Watery tearing is the least worrisome eye problem. Dogs fre-
quently have blocked tear ducts that cause tears that normally
drain from the eye socket to overflow onto the cheek. Your veteri-
narian can do a simple test to see whether the duct’s blocked, and
in some cases she can flush it out.
But the duct in many toy dogs is simply too small and your pup may
just have to live with it. You can combat the staining below her eyes
by wiping the tears often with an over-the-counter eye wipe specifi-
cally for tear staining. Turn to Chapter 9 for additional solutions.
If the tearing is chronic, if the eye shows any other signs of discom-
fort, or if the discharge is thick rather than watery, then a veteri-
narian needs to check your dog. Your Pom may have
 An infection, which can be treated with antibiotic drops.
 An irritation to his cornea, which may also be treatable, or a
lid problem that needs attention.
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 175

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
176
 Dry eye syndrome, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). The dog
doesn’t produce a normal amount of tears, so the cornea (the
outer clear coat of the eye) dries out and looks dull. The eye
may have a thick discharge, and the dog may blink, squint,
and rub at his eyes. Your veterinarian can diagnose the condi-
tion with a simple tear test and prescribe several treatment
options.
Limping
Your Pom may not be expected to run the Iditarod, but he does
need to run around your house on all four legs. All dogs can stub a
toe and end up a little gimpy now and then. But if your dog is favor-
ing one leg and not using it, examine the leg for broken bones, ten-
derly feeling down the leg’s length and comparing every bone,
including those of the foot, with that of the leg on the other side.
A broken bone, of course, needs veterinary attention.
You can treat less serious injuries at home. Follow these
suggestions:
 Ice packs help minimize swelling if applied immediately after
an injury, but moist heat is better for older injuries.
 Complete rest, even if it means locking your Pom in a crate, is
the best medicine for most cases of lameness. Rest him well
past the time he appears to be cured.
 Let him resume exercise gradually and on a leash.
 If three days go by with no improvement, you need to get a
veterinary opinion.
Aside from injury, an all too common cause of rear-leg lameness 
is patellar luxation (see the later section “Pondering Pom
Predispositions” for more on this problem) or sometimes, Legg-
Calve-Perthes (destruction of the head of the femur [thigh] bone
that may start at 3 to 4 months of age. Treatment is absolute rest
or surgery to remove the femur head.) Neither is an emergency,
but the sooner your veterinarian diagnoses them the better
because they only get worse with time.
Listlessness
When your Pomeranian pistol suddenly prefers to stay in bed
rather than play, take time to study her. Is she bored, tired, or
really sick? Poms can be misleading because they can push aside
their feelings of malaise and show up waggy-tailed for a favorite
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 

activity such as a walk or ride if you tempt them enough. Of
course, dogs gradually slow down as they mature and age, but a
relatively sudden change in activity level is cause for a trip to the
veterinarian. Look for these clues:
 A sick dog often lies in a curled or hunched up position rather
than sprawled out. This is a go-to-vet-today situation.
 A dog with a high fever is usually lethargic. Take the tempera-
ture (see Chapter 10), call the vet if it’s over 103 degrees, and
go to the emergency vet if it’s over 105. Cool the dog with wet
towels in either case.
 A dog with anemia or circulatory problems may seem weak.
Call the vet right away if the gums are white or gray.
 A dog having a hypoglycemic episode (low blood sugar; see
Chapter 8) may sleep (even when you try to rouse her) or
stagger and appear uncoordinated. Rub corn syrup on the
gums and go to the emergency vet right away.
 An uncomfortable dog may walk around restlessly, dig at the
ground, lie down, and then get right back up. This dog needs
to see the vet as soon as possible.
 A dog with abdominal pain often stands with her rear in the
air and the front flat to the ground, as though stretching. If
this continues more than an hour, see the vet promptly.
 A dog having a hard time breathing is often reluctant to lie
down; if she does, she lies on her stomach with head up and
nose pointed upward. This is an emergency vet situation.
 A dog in pain may shiver, pant, or both. See the vet right away
if it continues.
Loss of appetite
If your Pomeranian sticks his pointy nose up at dinner occasion-
ally, don’t think it’s cause to rush to the veterinarian. But if he’s
been a hearty eater and then gradually leaves more and more in
his bowl, he needs to be checked out. By the same token, if he 
suddenly stops eating and misses more than a meal or two, some-
thing’s probably not right. Take into consideration, though, that
dogs eat less during hot weather.
Because of the dangers of hypoglycemia (see Chapter 8), you’re
wiser to overreact than to wait and see, especially with tiny, thin,
young, or older Poms.

Urination changes
You may notice that your dog has accidents or needs to go out
more often than normal. This clue means you need to pay close
attention to her. Several disorders can cause changes in urination,
and the types of changes vary widely. Your veterinarian can often
pinpoint the problem with a simple urinalysis.
 Urinating small amounts suddenly and often, especially in
females, may indicate a urinary tract infection. The dog may
also cry out when urinating. Antibiotics can cure this uncom-
fortable condition, and cranberry tablets can help prevent
this condition in Poms that are prone to it.
 Dribbling urine during sleep most commonly occurs in
spayed females. Drugs often treat it successfully.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
A spoonful of sugar or blatant trickery:
Giving your Pom medicine
Medicine that sits in the bottle or splatters all over the floor doesn’t do your Pom (or
your wallet) much good. But managing to get pills and liquid medicine where they
need to go can be frustrating if not downright impossible.
For pills, try one of these options:
 The stick-it-down-the-throat option: Gently open the mouth, place the pill as
far back as possible (aided by a tiny shove with your index finger), close the
mouth, and gently rub the throat. You also can buy a piller, a small plunger that
takes the place of your finger. If your pup is used to you opening her mouth and
handing her a treat from puppyhood, this should be a snap.
 The hide-it-in-food option: Unless medical reasons prevent this method, hide
the pill in a bit of peanut butter or liverwurst. If your Pom’s suspicious and filter-
feeds her way through the food, add these steps:
1. Make three balls of food.
2. Feed her the first one to convince her that the food’s safe to eat.
3. Feed her the second one that holds the pill.
4. Excitedly show her the third ball before she finishes the second one so she
wants to eat the second one, plus pill, in a hurry.
5. Give her the third ball.
Liquid medicine is tougher to administer than pills. You need to pull out one cheek
so it makes a little pocket, squirt the stuff in, and hope for the best. (And giving a
little treat as a reward never hurts.)

 Cloudy or bloody urine can indicate infection of the prostate
or bladder. The dog may also strain to urinate. These infections
can be extremely painful and require antibiotic treatment. 
Left untreated, they can reach the kidneys and cause even
more serious problems. Castration is usually the treatment
of choice for males with repeated prostate problems.
 Painful urination, often with blood in the urine, can indicate
urinary stones, especially in males. These stones can be diag-
nosed with a radiograph and often controlled with diet. Surgery
may be necessary initially to resolve the problem, however.
 Increased urination and increased thirst can indicate dia-
betes or kidney disease. Diabetes can be diagnosed with a
urine test and controlled through diet and insulin injections.
I cover ailments common in older dogs, including kidney dis-
ease, in Chapter 10.
 Inability to urinate is an condition that requires immediate
veterinary attention.
Vomiting
Every dog owner has been awakened by the “urp, urp, urp” of pre-
cious Patty puking all over the best carpet in the house. Dogs seem
to vomit almost as a recreational activity.
Vomiting is a concern when it
 Continues for more than three upheavals at a time
 Contains more than a tiny bit of blood
 Contains a substance resembling coffee grounds (it’s partially
digested blood)
 Contains anything resembling fecal material (unless your dog
eats feces)
 Accompanies any other symptoms of illness such as lethargy
or diarrhea
 Has no results (the dog repeatedly tries to vomit but nothing
comes up)
All these instances merit a call to the veterinarian.
Sometimes dogs vomit early in the morning simply because their
stomachs are empty. Feeding your dog a late-night snack can fix
the problem. In another scenario, dogs often vomit after they eat
grass. Nobody knows exactly why they do this, but it seldom
means your dog is sick.

Pondering Pom Predispositions
Like all breeds, Pomeranians descend from a comparatively small
group of founding fathers and mothers that were eventually inter-
bred so that today’s Poms are all related to one another. So the
entire population forms what geneticists call a closed breeding
population. Unfortunately, every dog (Poms too) averages six dele-
terious (bad) recessive genes. As Pom descendents started to inter-
breed, chances naturally increased for both a father and a mother
to carry the same bad genes. As a result, their progeny inherited two
copies of that gene and inevitably exhibited the undesirable trait.
So every breed of dog has passed its own menu of hereditary
headaches down through generations. Breeders try to avoid pair-
ing parents who may carry the same recessives genes — and with
the advent of DNA testing, that solution’s becoming more and more
effective. But genetic problems are still a long way from disappearing.
Meanwhile, be on the lookout for the Pomeranian predispositions
covered in this section.
Alopecia X: Hair loss
Pomeranians have one hair trait that they’d rather do without: a
condition called alopecia X. Common to many of the spitz breeds,
the condition goes by several other names: black skin disease,
castration responsive alopecia, and growth hormone responsive
alopecia. Because the condition is much more common in males
than females, researchers speculate that it’s gender-linked.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
Two different breeds of medicine
Just as with human medicine, complementary and alternative therapies may help
your sick dog. Complementary therapies are out-of-mainstream veterinary medi-
cines that accompany mainstream therapies; alternative therapies replace main-
stream therapies. Many veterinaries use both traditional and nontraditional
therapies in their practices.
Popular complementary and alternative therapies include acupuncture, aro-
matherapy, Bach flower therapy (for emotional harmony), botanical medicine, chi-
ropractic, homeopathy, magnetic therapy, massage therapy, nutraceutical (natural
foods) therapy, nutritional therapy, and physical therapy.
For more information, visit AltVetMed, the most comprehensive source for alterna-
tive veterinary medicine on the Web, at www.altvetmed.org.

The trait seems to have two forms:
 Early onset form: A puppy grows a luxurious puppy coat,
sheds it, and no adult coat ever replaces it.
 Late onset form: A Pom with a normal adult coat loses guard
hairs, which leaves the fuzzy undercoat and gives the dog a
puppy-coat look. Eventually the undercoat goes, too. The bald
skin turns dark, but the dog doesn’t seem uncomfortable or
itchy.
Because this hair loss occurs in several other disorders, your vet-
erinarian will test your Pom’s blood, urine, and skin to rule out
hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease, and other conditions.
For some reason, spaying or castrating resolves the condition in
many dogs, so that’s the first step if your Pom hasn’t been fixed.
The dog often grows a full coat within months of the surgery,
although the coat isn’t always permanent.
If neutering your dog doesn’t work, the next step is melatonin (hor-
mone) tablets, which help 50 percent of dogs within three months.
If the hair does grow, you can eventually taper the dosage, but he’ll
probably need to stay on some dosage forever.
Ask your veterinarian about the pros and cons of other options
such as therapy with adrenal sex hormones, methyltestosterone,
lysodren, growth hormones, prednisone, and cimetidine, which
have varying degrees of success. Some of these have undesirable
side effects, so they aren’t generally first choices.
Alopecia X is mostly a cosmetic condition; at some point you may
find it’s better to simply accept it than to administer drugs that
adversely affect your Pom’s health. For more information, go to
pcoc.net/black-skin-disease.htm.
Entropion: Eyelid problems
With entropion, an eyelid (usually the bottom one) rolls inward
toward the eye. The lashes irritate the cornea, causing tearing,
squinting, and perhaps sensitivity to light. If the cornea continues
to be irritated, it can actually develop ulcers and scars that impair
vision. Entropion is hereditary, although the exact genetic mecha-
nism is unknown.
The condition is often first noted in puppyhood, but some pups
outgrow the disorder as the face structure changes. For this reason,
veterinarians don’t perform surgery on pups but may temporarily
tack the lid to help alleviate any discomfort. If the lid still rolls
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 181

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
182
inward after the dog’s matured, major surgery can resolve the
problem. Because it’s better to undercorrect than overcorrect,
more than one surgery may be necessary.
Hydrocephalus: Water on the brain
Small dogs with a tendency toward domed heads, such as Poms,
seem to be predisposed to hydrocephalus, or water on the brain.
The brain is normally bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, which is con-
stantly produced, circulated, and reabsorbed. In some dogs, either
too much fluid is produced or too little is reabsorbed, so the fluid
accumulates around the brain, pushing the soft bones of the
puppy’s skull outward and giving the appearance of a big, round,
head. After the skull hardens with maturity, it can’t expand, so the
excess pressure pushes in on the brain.
A Pom puppy with hydrocephalus generally has the following
symptoms:
 An abnormally round skull at 12 weeks old
 An open fontanel (soft spot)
 Eyes that diverge so that each is directed outward (the oppo-
site of cross-eyed)
 Seizures or blindness
 Presses her head into walls
 Is extremely difficult to housetrain
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
Help find a cure
You can help the future health of Pomeranians by contributing to health research,
either with money or samples. For example, at the time of this writing, the Canine
Health Foundation is sponsoring research into alopecia X in Pomeranians. Monetary
contributions from individuals are needed to supplement the funding, however. In
addition, researchers need blood samples from Pomeranians, both normal and
affected, in order to find the gene or genes responsible. Go to pcoc.net/black-
skin-disease.htm to find out how to contribute or participate.
Remember to consider other canine health projects through the AKC Canine Health
Foundation (www.akcchf.org) and the Morris Animal Foundation (www.morris
animalfoundation.org).

Your veterinarian can take radiographs. A definite diagnosis usu-
ally requires more sophisticated scans from specialists.
Poms with mild hydrocephalus can live long and full lives, but
may be somewhat mentally retarded. In most cases, though, the
condition gradually worsens throughout puppyhood. Drugs can
temporarily decrease pressure and swelling, but they’re not usu-
ally a lifelong fix.
For a more permanent fix (needed in all but the mildest cases), a
specialist places a small tube in the brain to drain the excess fluid
to another part of the body. The shunt must be replaced as the
puppy grows, and complications often occur. Because of the diffi-
culties treating hydrocephalus, euthanasia is often recommended.
Open fontanel: Soft spot
Just as with a human baby, a canine infant is born with the bony
plates of the skull somewhat soft and separated. These bones usu-
ally harden and gradually fuse together over two to three months.
In some Poms, the plates never fuse and a soft spot, the fontanel,
remains throughout life.
Because the skull’s function is to protect the brain, obviously a soft
spot is a worry. A hit on the head in just the wrong place can mean
brain damage. Affected dogs don’t know they should be more care-
ful, and most Poms with open fontanels are never bothered by
them — except by their owners’ fretting. No treatment is available.
Patellar luxation: Bad knees
Have you seen a dog that takes a few steps, then holds one hind leg
up and forward, skips a step or two, and then take a few more
steps? At first this may look like a jaunty little jig, but more likely
it’s a challenging condition called patellar luxation.
This common problem involves the patella (kneecap) of one or
both rear legs. Normally, the patella slides up and down in a small
groove of the femur (thigh bone) as the leg bends and the knee
moves. But if the groove is too shallow or the tendon of the quadri-
ceps muscle has too much rotational pull, the patella can ride over
the side of the groove.
Because the luxated (out-of-place) muscle has to relax before the
patella can pop back into place, the dog often hops for a few steps
with the leg straight until the patella pops back. This popping
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 183

hurts (your dog may yelp) and wears down the ridge, causing the
condition to worsen.
In small dogs, signs of patellar luxation appear as early as 8 weeks
of age but usually are apparent by 6 months; the patella tends to slip
toward the inside, giving a bowlegged look. Early diagnosis is helpful
in slowing the progress, but treatment depends on the severity of
the condition. Table 11-2 presents the levels of patellar luxation.

Cases that appear in puppyhood usually develop into grade 3 or 4
in adulthood. Cases that first appear in young adults usually
develop into grade 2 or 3. Cases that first appear in older adults
are usually grade 1 or 2.
Surgery to tighten any stretched tissues and reconstruct the
groove or realign the muscle can improve the condition. A young
dog with grade 1 or 2, or any age dog with grade 3 or 4, is a candi-
date. Surgery may not make the leg perfect, but it will enable your
Pom to run and walk relatively free of pain. An orthopedic special-
ist has the best chance of successfully treating the condition.
Glucosamine supplements may help to build cartilage and may be
helpful for grade 1 cases, but they aren’t much help in more seri-
ous cases.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
184 Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 

The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals maintains a registry for
dogs that have been screened for patellar luxation. Although only a
limited number have been evaluated, Pomeranians have the unfor-
tunate distinction of having the highest percentage (48 percent) of
the condition of any breed. Most veterinarians believe the condi-
tion is hereditary in Poms.
Patent ductus arteriosus:
Heart defect
Patent ductus arteriosus (just call it PDA) occurs when a blood
vessel (the ductus arteriosus) fails to close after birth. The func-
tion of this blood vessel is to bypass the nonfunctioning lungs
during fetal life. So when it stays patent (open and working) after
birth, the vessel sends blood that’s supposed to go to the rest of
the body to the lungs instead.
Most puppies with PDA seem completely normal except for a heart
murmur. Your veterinarian can hear the murmur, but a veterinary
cardiologist usually makes an exact diagnosis. PDA can lead to
heart failure. Although drugs can control the signs of heart failure,
the best treatment is early surgery, preferably by 5 months of age
(before permanent damage can occur). Without surgery, life
expectancy is about two years. With surgery, the dog should be
able to live a full life.
PDA is the most common hereditary heart problem in dogs, and
it’s particularly prevalent in Pomeranians, especially females.
Tracheal collapse: Breathing
problems
Tracheal collapse is most common in toy breeds. The trachea, or
windpipe, consists of a series of cartilage rings. In some Poms, the
cartilage isn’t as rigid as it should be, so some of the rings collapse,
flattening the trachea and obstructing breathing. If the collapse is
in the neck area, the dog has trouble inhaling. If the collapse is in
the chest area, the dog has trouble exhaling.
Several factors (like obesity, respiratory infection, enlarged heart,
endotracheal intubation, or inhalation of irritants or allergens) can
make a tracheal collapse episode more likely. Coughing, which is a
major symptom, can also make the condition worse.
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 185

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
186
Affected dogs often cough with a harsh, goose-like honk, especially
when they’re excited, when pressure is put on the throat, or when
they’re eating or drinking. In severe cases, the dog can’t get
enough air, causing him to faint and get a bluish cast to the tongue.
The best way to diagnose the condition is with an endoscope,
which usually means going to an internal medicine specialist, but
your own veterinarian may be able to take a series of radiographs
(X-rays) to diagnose the condition. The trachea changes its dimen-
sions as the dog breathes in and out, so a single radiograph often
misses the critical time of change.
In severe cases, the best option may be implanted prosthetic sup-
ports. A specialist who has experience in this type of surgery must
perform this procedure because it’s complex. The nature of the
surgery means that it isn’t always successful.
In less-severe cases of tracheal collapse, the following adjustments
may help:
 Reducing weight
 Using a harness rather than a collar
 Humidifying the air
 Avoiding irritants such as cigarette smoke
 Avoiding any situation that may lead to overheating, stress,
heavy panting, or coughing
 Taking glucosamine and vitamin C supplements to strengthen
cartilage
 Using bronchodilators (this practice is controversial)
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
Poms and anesthesia
Anesthesia, though not without risks, is far safer today than several years ago, when
injectible barbiturate anesthesia was popular. Newer inhalant anesthesias (like
isoflurane and sevofluran) and newer induction agents (like propofol) are far safer
than traditional agents.
Risks can also be reduced by a presurgical health check that includes blood test-
ing and by careful monitoring during surgery. Because of a Pom’s tiny trachea, the
veterinarian must be extremely careful when placing the tube. Your best veterinar-
ian is one experienced with surgery on tiny dogs.

Dealing with Emergencies
If you face an emergency with your Pom, remember to stay calm.
Your calm voice is the best medicine at first.
If your dog appears to be severely injured, start with the ABCs of
first aid (I explain them in this section). Then call your veterinarian
or go to the emergency clinic — and drive carefully! What would
happen to your sick dog if you had an accident and ended up going
to the hospital yourself?
A is for airway
Small dogs can choke on dog treats, small balls, rawhide, bones,
toys, and other items around the house and yard. A choking dog
may paw frantically at his mouth, try to retch, or make heaving
chest motions — but he can’t breathe.
Open his mouth and either pull his tongue forward or push
down on the back of the tongue. Then look and gently feel for any
obstructions. If you can see an obstruction, try to gently reach two
fingers in and extract it. But if this doesn’t work, use the Heimlich
maneuver.
Chapter 11: Doctoring Your Dog 187
Selecting a specialist
Just as you see a specialist when your health problems are more complex than your
family practitioner normally handles, your dog may also benefit from a veterinary
specialist. Don’t be afraid to ask whether a specialist could help. Most veterinari-
ans are pleased that you asked and will find the appropriate specialist, set up an
appointment for you, and send along any medical records. A specialist can be
expensive, so consider asking about fees before you go.
The American Veterinary Medical Association presently recognizes 20 specialties.
You can find specialists in your area by going to the Web sites of the appropriate
specialty organization. The ones you’re more likely to need are

1. Hold him against your chest, head up, and facing away
from you.
2. Place your fist just beneath the end of his sternum 
(chest bone).
3. Grasp that fist with your other hand and give five rapid
thrusts inward and upward.
4. Check the airway and repeat Steps 1 through 3 if needed.
5. If he’s unconscious, give artificial respiration (see the
next section).
B is for breathing
Is he breathing? Is his chest rising and falling? If not, check for
obstructions (see the previous section). If no obstruction is pres-
ent, perform artificial resuscitation.
1. Place him down on his side.
2. Open the mouth, clear away any mucus, and pull the
tongue forward. Seal your mouth over the dog’s nose and
mouth.
3. Blow gently into the nose for two seconds, then release.
Use gentle puffs. Pomeranians have very small lungs. Blow
just enough to see the chest rise. If the chest doesn’t rise,
blow harder, make a tighter seal around the lips, or check
again for an obstruction.
4. Repeat Step 3 at the rate of one breath every five sec-
onds, stopping after one minute to monitor breathing and
pulse.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until he’s breathing on his own.
6. When he does resume breathing, get him to the vet.
C is for circulation
Check your dog’s pulse by placing your fingers on his femoral
artery (inside the thigh, near where the rear leg meets the
abdomen — see Figure 11-1) or on his left chest just behind the
elbow. Also check the tongue and gum color. If they’re bluish or if
the gums are pale, he’s not getting enough oxygen but may still be
breathing. In this case, evaluate him for shock.

If you’re sure his heart isn’t beating, begin cardiopulmonary resus-
citation (CPR):
1. Place him on his right side on a table or floor.
2. Place your fingertips (one hand on top of the other) on
his left chest about 1 inch up from and behind the elbow.
3. Press down and quickly release at the rate of one com-
pression per second.
4. After every 10 to 15 compressions, stop to give two
breaths through the nose (see the previous section). If
you have a helper, you can continue while your helper
gives breaths every 3 to 4 compressions.
5. Continue with Steps 2 through 4 until you feel a pulse.
Then get him to the vet.

M
ost everyone likes a road trip, especially dogs. And all dogs
seem to be entranced by the automobile more than any
other product of modern technology. Pomeranians are no excep-
tion. Utter the magic word “Goforaride,” and your Pom turns into a
whirling dervish of excitement.
With some planning, you may find that having your Pom as a travel
mate is the best idea you ever had. After all, he never complains
about getting lost or about your taste in radio stations. And he
gives you a good excuse to stretch your legs and take little nature
side trips.
Without planning, though, traveling with a dog can be a hassle. You
can find yourself turned away from motel after motel or paying
expensive pet fees. You may not be able to take him to many of the
attractions on your list, and in warm weather, you may have to
skip shopping altogether because it’s too hot to leave him in the
car. You may also start to describe your sightseeing as drive-bys, as
in “I drove by this” and “I drove by that.”
Unfortunately you can even lose a friend if you stay at her house
with a Pom that suddenly forgets his housetraining, as dogs too
often do when away from their comfort zone. And on really long
trips, your Pom may drive you crazy with whining and scratching,
the canine equivalent of “Are we there yet?”

Because I care about your sanity (and your dog’s!), in this chapter I
help you pack the important stuff and navigate the sometimes-
frustrating motel experience. I also tell you all you need to know to
travel safely and happily with your Pom, whether on asphalt or up
in the clouds.
Packing for Your Pomeranian
Everybody on your excursion will surely have a suitcase. And
before you load up and head out, make sure your dog does, too.
Even though she doesn’t need five pairs of shoes and an armload
of clothes just in case, she does need her own essentials. Be sure to
pack the following items:
 Basic grooming equipment
 Bed
 Bottled water or water from home (strange water can some-
times cause diarrhea)
 Bowls for food and water
 Bug spray or flea spray
 Chewies and interactive toys to pass the time
 Flashlight for late-night walks
 Food (if you use cans, get the pop tops or bring a can opener)
 Identification tags
 Medications including antidiarrheal medication and possibly
his monthly heartworm preventive; also, motion-sickness pills
if your dog suffers from that malady
 Paper towels, moist towelettes, and rinse-free shampoo for
that carsick thing
 Plastic baggies or other poop-disposal tools
 Rabies certificate (some places require them)
 Recent color photo in case he gets lost
 Short and long leashes
 Towels (figure on one or two a day, including one to place
over his bedding in the crate in case he gets carsick)
 Travel crate or (second choice) doggy seatbelt

Hitting the Road
“Let’s go!” Those words will have your Pom running to the car,
bouncing with excitement, and barking at you to open the door.
It’s no secret that the automobile is the Pom’s favorite mode of
transportation. You can keep your easy rider loving it for years to
come by keeping him safe, ride after ride.
Practicing safety first
In the good old days you could simply throw your dog and your kid
in the backseat and tool down the road. Now your child has to ride
in a car seat or with a seatbelt because these restraints happen to
save lives.
Take the same care to ensure your Pom’s safety, whether traveling
cross-country or just to the store. Although using a crate may
seem to take some of the fun away, traveling within a secured crate
(either attached to a seat belt or to some solid part of the car) has
saved many canine lives. Besides, you don’t need a dog jumping on
your lap or checking out the driver’s seat floor while you’re driving.
What about a seat belt? You can buy a doggy seatbelt that is
pretty much like a harness attached to an existing seat belt (see
Figure 12-1). It’s probably not quite as safe as a crate, but it’s better
than a flying Pom. And it does let him ride in the front seat and
look out the window.
This seems unnecessary to mention, but just in case: Never let
your Pomeranian ride in the back of a pickup truck! And don’t let
him hang out the window! If you wouldn’t let a toddler do it, don’t
let your Pom do it either.
Although the thought is unpleasant, preparation for a problem is
key. What if you had an accident and couldn’t speak for your
injured dog? As an extra safety measure, place emergency informa-
tion on the side of the crate that says something like “In case of
emergency, take this dog to a veterinarian, then contact the follow-
ing persons: [Insert contact info]. Payment of all expenses incurred
is guaranteed.” Include a list of any medications or health prob-
lems your dog may have.
Of course, your dog should be wearing identification as well, and
not just your home phone number. After all, you’re not home. If
you’re on vacation, add the contact number of somebody back
home or the number where you can be reached. (Obviously, this
last number is in case your Pom gets lost.)
Chapter 12: Traveling with a Pom Pilot 193

Figure 12-1: A doggy seatbelt lets your Pom enjoy the ride safely.
Keeping your Pom cool and comfy
Your Pom can’t reach the control knobs for heat and air in the car,
so you have to keep an eye on him to make sure he’s comfy. Unless
you’re in snow country, that’s pretty easy. Just keep your car as
warm as you like it, and he’ll like it, too. If you have to leave him in
the car for a short while, consider bringing along a hot water bottle
to put in his crate or at least cover the crate with a blanket.
Despite all the warnings about leaving dogs in cars in summer
heat, many dogs die every year from just that. Cars take a very
short time to heat up, reaching more than 100 degrees in minutes
when it’s mild outside and reaching 160 degrees in minutes when
it’s warm to hot out.
In hot weather, keep the crate where the air conditioning can reach
it. A fan that plugs into your car battery is cheap and can direct air
onto your Pom. Keep him out of direct sunshine, and consider
bringing a cooler with an ice pack so you can place the pack beside
him in the crate.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
194

But you can’t rely on any such measures on a hot day. Even if you
can keep your car running with the air conditioner on, don’t trust
it. The price of mechanical failure is too high. You may just have to
choose between leaving your dog at home and going shopping.
Flying the Friendly Skies
Small dogs, including Poms, have many advantages when it comes
to travel. In a car, they take up less space than the average suitcase.
In an airplane, they can ride with you in the passenger section
instead of the baggage compartment. The only qualifiers are that
 You must make reservations well in advance because most
airlines allow only one or two dogs per flight to ride in the
passenger section.
 The dog must ride in a wide, low crate that can fit under the
seat in front of you.
 She must stay in the crate throughout the flight.
Few times do the words “I told you to do that before we left home!”
have as much meaning as when your dog suddenly has to go at
40,000 feet. This is one time you may want to go easy on the water
before you leave. The same goes for food. Place an absorbent
puppy housetraining pad in the crate; if the situation becomes des-
perate, you can take the dog and the pad to the plane’s restroom,
disposing of the pad as you would a baby’s diaper.
The following items can make the trip more endurable, even enjoy-
able, for your pup, you, and the other passengers:
 A few treats or a chew to help the time pass (although you
don’t want to give out too much food)
 Ice cubes from the beverage cart
 Paper towels and extra bedding just in case she has an acci-
dent in her crate
Minding Your Motel Manners
It’s time to stop for the evening. You’re tired, your dog’s restless.
You pull into another motel . . . another sign proclaims NO PETS.
Time to face the music: Too many motels have been subjected to
the inconsiderate ways of too many dog owners. These owners let
their dogs pee on the carpet, shed on the bed, and poop on the
grass where people walk. The problem costs the motels money to
Chapter 12: Traveling with a Pom Pilot 195

clean up, and it costs them the goodwill (and future business) of
guests who grow tired of stepping in dog doo-doo or hearing dogs
bark all night.
Fortunately, many motels still leave their doors open to well-
mannered pets. You can go online and visit several Web sites that
list pet-friendly lodgings. Here’s a quick list of some good sites:
 www.fidofriendly.com
 www.dogfriendly.com
 www.canineauto.com
 www.petswelcome.com
To keep pets welcome, follow these rules:
 Never leave your dog unattended in the room. He may feel
deserted and try to dig his way out the door, or he may simply
bark the whole time.
Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
196
Heading for doggy destinations
Your dog won’t hesitate to erupt with ecstasy at even the most mundane trips,
whether it’s a trip to the gas station or a move across the country. She’ll even like
going with you on your vacations. But what about taking her on a trip that’s all about
her?
Is your Pomeranian a cosmopolitan canine? Several high-end hotels now cater to
their canine clientele. Some luxury hotels in big cities offer dog-spoiling services
such as special treats, menus, toys, and even walking and grooming services. Some
rural lodges offer fenced acreage, beaches, or short hiking trails. Expect to pay
more than your run-of-the-mill place that caters to humans, anywhere from $100 to
$300 a night.
Is your dog more the back-to-nature type? How about camp? Dog camps are big
these days. No, your dog doesn’t make leather wallets or lanyards, but she can pick
up a variety of skills and tricks, play games, go hiking, and just plain have a yapping
good time. The best part is that you don’t just drop your dog off — you go there with
her! It’s fun for you, too, and you can make new friends who also like to share activ-
ities with their dogs. Dog camps average about $100 a day.
Plan to study the offerings of each camp because different camps specialize in dif-
ferent types of activities. For example, a camp specializing in chasing an artificial
rabbit or weight pulling may not be the best choice for a Pomeranian. In addition, any
camp where all the dogs run loose together just isn’t safe for a tiny dog. Ask whether
they have special sessions for small dogs.

 Bring his crate (or at least his own dog bed) into the room
with you. If he likes to get on people beds, bring a sheet or roll
down the bedspread so he doesn’t get hair on it.
 If he has an accident on the carpet, don’t try to hide it. Clean
what you can and tell the management. Leave a big tip for
housecleaning.
 Instead of washing food bowls in the sink (food clogs the
drain), use disposable paper bowls.
 Clean up any dog poop your dog deposits on motel property.
 Be considerate of others. Don’t let him bark! Don’t rev him up
with games that make him bark. Instead, distract or correct
him if he tries to bark at the sound of other guests walking
past the room.
Don’t try to sneak your dog into a motel room. It’s a recipe for a
miserable night, and you can be sure your Pom will suddenly find a
hundred reasons to bark as you desperately try to shush him.
Leaving Your Dog Behind
When You Must Go
Sometimes leaving your dog behind when you go out of town is
the smartest choice you can make — as long as you make smart
choices about where you leave him.
Taking your dog to a boarding place
If your dog has no issues being away from home, a boarding kennel
is usually your best choice for care while you’re away. They’re gen-
erally safest because there is no chance of escape, and somebody
is there in case your dog gets sick, or in case of fire, earthquake, or
UFO attack.
The ideal kennel has the following features:
 Is approved by the American Boarding Kennel Association
 Has climate-controlled accommodations
 Has private runs for each dog that don’t allow dogs to poke
parts of themselves into adjacent runs
 Disinfects each run prior to a new boarder
Chapter 12: Traveling with a Pom Pilot 197

Part III: Caring for Your Pom from Head to Paw 
198
If your pet takes a trip without you . . .
Nobody expects to lose a dog, but it can happen to even the most conscientious
caretaker. A door is left open, a hole appears in a fence, or the dog escapes from a
car window. Most lost dogs are found, but the sooner you organize search efforts,
the better your chances of being reunited with your Pom.
Begin your search by going to the place your dog is most likely to go and to the most
dangerous place for your dog to go (usually a roadway) and call for your dog. Be
careful that your calling doesn’t lure your dog across a road.
If you haven’t found your dog after a couple of hours, spend your time getting the
word out:
 Ask area delivery people, children, and neighbors whether they’ve seen a dog
matching the description of yours.
 Call area veterinarians to see whether someone’s brought in an injured small dog.
 Call area shelters. Even if they say no such dog has been brought in, visit them
by the following day. And keep checking.
 Call the nonemergency phone number for the local police agencies and ask that
patrolling officers be on the lookout for the dog.
 By the end of the first day, make large posters and saturate the area; place them
on the cars of anyone in your search team. Some large pet supply stores sell
rolls of plastic fill-in-the-blank lost-dog posters.
Describe your dog well. (A photo is always the best descriptor.) Most people don’t
know every breed, so don’t just state Pomeranian. Describe it as something they
may be more familiar with, like “looks like a Chihuahua with puffy hair.”
Don’t describe everything about your dog. Keep some identifying markers secret
so that you can ask people who claim to have found your dog to identify as proof.
 After a few days, make mailer postcards for delivery in a larger target area (like
a 2-to-5-mile radius from the place your dog was lost) and to veterinary clinics
and animal shelters. Note that some national organizations like Sherlock Bones
(www.sherlockbones.com;800-942-6637) can help you prepare posters and
preaddressed mailers (depending on your location) and deliver them to you by
overnight mail for a fee.
 If your dog is lost while away from home, take something familiar (like his crate,
bed, or your clothing with your scent on it) to where he last saw you. Many dogs
return to the place they were last with their owner. If possible, keep your car
parked with a door open where the dog last saw it.
Don’t give up hope. Many dogs have been found days, weeks, and sometimes even
months after they’ve been lost. But the less time that elapses before you mobilize
your search, the greater your chances are of recovery. This is one time it pays to be
an alarmist and one of many times it pays to be prepared. And remember, it always
pays to microchip your dog! (See Chapter 10.)

 Has a caretaker on the grounds 24 hours a day
 Requires proof of current immunizations and an incoming
check for fleas
 Allows you to bring your dog’s toys and bedding
 Provides a raised surface area so dogs don’t have to sleep on
the floor
Ask to see the facilities. It won’t smell like Grandma’s kitchen, but
it shouldn’t make you lose your lunch.
Your veterinary hospital may also provide boarding services. If so,
it’s your best choice for a dog that has ongoing health problems.
These facilities usually aren’t as spacious as regular boarding 
kennels, but space isn’t necessarily a big deal for a little Pom.
Veterinary hospitals and boarding kennels may have comparable
runs and prices and both may offer grooming. But if you want
luxury perks like playtime, television, and walks, you need to find a
luxury boarding kennel.
Some individuals offer in-home boarding for a limited number of
dogs. The dogs essentially live as the person’s dog during that
time. This arrangement provides a comfortable environment for
your dog, but keep these two cautions in mind:
 Make sure the home is safe for such a small dog.
 Make sure the individual doesn’t board large dogs that can
run loose at the same time as your Pom.
Hiring a pet sitter
If your Pom is a little uneasy around other dogs or in strange places,
consider having a pet sitter come in to take care of her in your
home. Keep in mind, though, that having the kid down the street
take on this important responsibility is seldom a good idea. What if
the dog gets out? What if your pup or the sitter gets sick? An inex-
perienced pet sitter — just like an inexperienced babysitter —
doesn’t know what to do in times of need. That’s why you should
opt for bonded, experienced pet sitters.
The main drawback is that pet sitters usually visit only a couple of
times a day. Unless your Pom is paper trained or litter-box trained
or you have a doggy door leading to a secure kennel, two visits
aren’t really enough. Another concern is for Poms susceptible to
hypoglycemia, who need more frequent feedings. Small dogs, espe-
cially those with medical problems, need supervision throughout
the day.

Part IV
Training Your Pom
with TLC

In this part . . .
P
oms may be little, but they still need to be trained.
Little dogs can be as much a nuisance as big dogs,
and you don’t want your friends thinking your dog is a
spoiled little brat that they need to avoid.
Besides, training makes life pleasant for both of you — 
no more urine-soaked carpets, no more run-away dog, no
more jumping on your new white pants. And training
makes your Pom safer. You need your dog to come when
called, to stop when doing something dangerous, and to
refrain from biting or other bad behaviors that can label
your dog a public menace.
The best part of training, though, is that it’s fun, and 
training with rewards strengthens the bond between you
and your dog. When you try the positive reward based
methods I show you, you may ﬁnd your Pom reminding
you that it’s time for her class.
What fun you’re going to have showing off your little genius!

B
abies don’t come potty trained. Neither do puppies. Toy dog
puppies, in particular, seem to take a little longer to house-
train — but at least their messes are miniature!
As you soap up yet another Pomeranian puddle, don’t despair. By
following some simple guidelines, you really can housetrain your
Pom puppy. And if your adult Pom has problems, maybe she
wasn’t trained well to start with. You can go back to basics and
train her as though she’s a puppy. This chapter guides you in all
you need to know — from getting started with the training to solv-
ing potty-behavior dilemmas.
Deciding When and Where to
Housetrain Your Pom Pup
The best time to introduce housetraining is when your puppy is
between 7 and 9 weeks of age. Younger puppies either don’t have
the physical control to comply or can’t comprehend what crazy
idea you’re driving at.
After 9 weeks of age, puppies often try to go on the surface they
were using between 7 and 9 weeks. For example, if somebody

thought it was a good idea to throw a scatter rug in the pen for
them to use, it’s likely they’ll use any scatter rug or big rug in your
house as their preferred potty surface. This is one reason to raise
puppies with access to grass or the surface they’ll use as adults.
Every time your puppy goes on grass, the routine reinforces grass
as the appropriate place. The same is true if you want her to go on
cement (for city dogs) or even on doggy litter. Unfortunately, it’s
equally true for rugs, newspapers, and other places you don’t want
your dog to use for the rest of her life.
Newspapers? I highly recommend that you steer clear of them as
potty-training surfaces unless you have some desire to use them as
your ultimate potty surface. The problem is that urine-soaked
newspapers smell worse than just plain urine. And if you have a
habit of placing your newspaper on the floor, you guessed it — you
may find the paper soaked when you pick it up to read!
First, make up your own mind about where you ultimately want
him to go. Will he mostly be going in the yard? On the curb? In an
indoor potty? Practice early on with any of these options you plan
to use later. Fortunately, the training concept is the same.
Of course, your puppy won’t know where you want her to go, but
she instinctively knows where she should go — away from her own
den (in human terms, her crate or X-pen; more on these later).
Little puppies instinctively totter away from their nesting area to
relieve themselves. The problem is that they don’t go far because
they consider their den to be so small. So although she may be
careful to avoid her own bed or even her crate, she may deposit
her gifts right smack in the middle of your den and think she’s done
just fine.
Your goal, then, is to help her expand her definition of den so she
instinctively has no desire to make a deposit any place in your
home. You can broaden her limited viewpoint in three ways:
 Keep her confined unless she has just pottied. You can use
baby gates or exercise pens to confine her in a small area just
around the crate. As she grows older and goes longer without
soiling that small area, you can gradually expand her confine-
ment area, now her den.
 Expand the area of your home she considers her den. A
common problem as you give your puppy more freedom is that
you may find surprises in parts of the house you seldom visit.
The guest room is a favorite spot for such deposits, which of
course makes a wonderful impression on your guests. Your
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
204

first inclination may be to mumble something about that
sneaky little brat pretending to be housetrained but just doing
it where you don’t see. But that’s not the problem. She has
simply failed to identify these distant or unused areas of your
home as her den area because the two of you haven’t spent
any time there. She thinks they’re the great world beyond the
den, and remember, to a dog, the world is her potty.
To adjust her thinking, take a few steps backward by restrict-
ing her freedom. Then make sure you play or hang out
together in every room of your house to enforce the idea that
this is home turf.
 Get rid of the scent. Dogs are programmed to potty where
they can smell they’ve pottied before, so clean up an accident
with a special enzymatic cleaner (available from pet supply
stores).
Creating a Schedule 
(And Sticking to It)
To prevent your puppy from choosing the wrong location to potty,
you have to get her to the right place before she has to go. The
problem is that young puppies have poor bladder and bowel con-
trol, and even adult Poms have their limits.
To avoid accidents, remember the two S words: Schedule and Signs.
Later in this chapter (see the section “Housetraining in Action”) I
help you identify when your Pom needs to pee — for those times
it’s not completely obvious — but in this section I give you an
overview of the schedule you need to keep.
Dogs thrive on schedules, and keeping to a schedule is essential
for housetraining. There’s even a physiological reason for this: a
dog’s (and even a person’s) gut becomes unconsciously tuned to
certain rhythms. The bowel that empties itself at a certain time of
day wants to do it at that time every day, whether you remember
to let your dog out or not.
The bowel is also stimulated to empty itself by triggers that occur
after eating (usually about 15 minutes after eating a meal), so be
sure you have your pup in the right place at the right time. For the
same reason, don’t feed your puppy a big meal as you pop him into
his crate for the night or before you rush out of the house. Allow
plenty of potty time — 15 to 30 minutes or so — between feeding
and confinement.
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 205

When your pup wakes up, he immediately has to urinate. By keep-
ing him on a regular wake-sleep cycle, you can also train him to uri-
nate on a somewhat more regular cycle (although this is less
reliable than relieving his bowels on schedule).
A general guide is that a Pomeranian puppy can hold his urine for
as many hours as he is months old. So a 2-month-old pup can wait
for two hours, or a 4-month-old for four hours, up to about 6
months of age. But every dog is different. If you find your dog uri-
nates on average once an hour, take him out once every 45 min-
utes. Always take him out before his regularly scheduled program
of pee or poop.
Using a Crate, Pen, or Doggy Door
When You’re Away from Home
You can’t expect to watch your pup 24 hours a day — no one has
that kind of time! So, when you can’t watch him, confine him, just
like you’d put a toddler in a crib or playpen rather than letting him
just meander around your house alone.
Allowing a crate to teach 
him to hold it
One of the handiest items in your housetraining arsenal is a crate,
which your dog will come to think of as her den. You’ll want to first
teach her to enjoy her crate, and I explain how to do that in
Chapter 7.
Here’s why a crate helps in housetraining: In puppy world, a crate
is the equivalent of a crib. Puppies naturally avoid soiling their bed
(the smart critters know they don’t want to sit in it!), so being in
the crate encourages them to hold off going for a short while. This
natural response makes the crate your best bet when you can’t
watch him, even if you’re just in another part of the house.
To use the crate, place the puppy in it for short periods, never
longer than he can hold himself — never more hours than he is
months old, and never more than six hours, period. Let him out
when you can watch him. As soon as you open the door, take him
to his potty area. Note: You may have to carry him to get there
more quickly and avoid accidents.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
206

If your puppy is having accidents in his crate, you can probably
chalk it up to one or more of the following reasons:
 The crate is too large. The crate should be only big enough for
him to stand up, turn around, and lie down in. If it’s larger, he
can step to one side, relieve himself, and curl up on the other
side. No Great Dane–sized crates for housetraining a Pom!
 You’re leaving her in the crate too long. This move is not
only cruel but also stupid. By forcing him to go in his crate,
you’re telling him:
• Don’t bother trying to hold it.
• The crate is in fact an acceptable place to potty.
You’re undoing every bit of housetraining and setting yourself
up for a lifetime of cleaning out the crate and washing off the
dog every time you leave him crated. Yuck!
 Your puppy is experiencing separation anxiety or crate anxi-
ety. You can identify a dog with these problems because he’ll
usually also be panting and drooling in the crate, along with
possibly peeing and pooping. In this case, deal with the anxi-
ety problems first (see Chapter 15) or try using an exercise
pen setup, which I cover in the next section.
Letting her housetrain herself
in an exercise pen
Perhaps you need to crate your pup for longer than she can hold it.
Or maybe the weather’s too cold or too wet — your dog just
stands there on three feet, staring at you incredulously when you
try to get her to run out into the elements. Then again, maybe you
live on the 20th floor and the elevator stops on every floor while
your poor Pom tries to cross her legs. Maybe she’s had surgery, is
incontinent, or just plain can’t hold it until you come home. If you
face any of these situations, your best bet is to set up a small
indoor-exercise pen (see Chapter 5). This will allow her to step
away from her crate and into an indoor potty arrangement.
To potty train your Pom by confining her to a pen, you need a
crate and a litter box or indoor potty. Place her crate (with the
door open) in one corner and a litter box or indoor potty (see the
following section) in the other. This setup gives her access to a
proper surface and allows her to practically housetrain herself.
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 207

Using a grassy litter box
“But aren’t litter boxes for cats?” you may rightly ask. Au contraire —
litter boxes work for small dogs, too. Here’s the plan:
1. Buy a cat litter box or an even larger flat pan.
An ideal box has fairly high sides but a low entrance area
so your puppy doesn’t have to jump to get in it.
2. Buy some sod squares and place them inside the box or
on the pan.
Purchase these squares at a home supply store.
3. Place the box or pan where the puppy can reach it
inside.
Now your puppy has an indoor grassy area, and she’s
learning to do her duty on the proper surface. This routine
makes training her to go outside that much easier. When
the sod gets sodden (you’ll smell it!), replace it and plant it
in the yard.
You can also simply use dog litter, available at major pet supply
stores. It’s absorbent, has deodorizing properties, and is attractive
to dogs. Dog litter is a good choice if you plan to use a litter box
on a long-term basis because it’s hard to keep grass growing
inside and eventually you run out of places to plant the old sod
outdoors — especially if you live in an apartment!
Using other indoor options
A variety of fancier indoor plumbing options are available for Poms
who demand the very best. Well, maybe not plumbing options,
more like potty options. They include the following:
 Disposable absorbent pads scented to attract puppies: The
pads absorb moisture and have a waterproof barrier. Their
drawback? Some dogs, especially puppies, like to shred them.
Be sure to get the tie-down variety so your dog doesn’t surf
across the floor on them. They’re also great for trips.
 Washable pads: These pads have a waterproof barrier, an
absorbent middle layer, and a moisture-proof top layer to
keep the outside surface dry. They’re less expensive in the
long run than disposable ones but not as practical for trips or
short-term solutions.
 Indoor yards of artificial turf placed over a grate: With this
setup, liquids drain into a disposal pan so your dog has a
somewhat more natural surface to go on. You must empty the
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
208

pan regularly and hose down and deodorize the turf. One
thing to note is that artificial sod may not be as attractive to
some dogs that are used to going on real grass, so make sure
it’s working for your dog.
 Indoor yards of real sod: This is, of course, the ultimate in
bringing the outdoors to your dog. You have to water the
grass, although some have an underground dirtless system,
so you just place water in a reservoir. Still, you need to hose it
down with deodorizing spray and replace the grass every few
months. These systems do better on an outdoor patio but
work well indoors with more frequent grass replacement.
Costs for indoor potty systems range from about $15 for a box of
pads to $300 for a fancy turf system that cleans itself. Check a pet
supply store or search “indoor potty” on the Internet.
Installing a doggy door
If you have a house with a yard and don’t want to go the indoor-
potty route, you may be able to use a doggy door. All sorts of
doors are available at pet supply stores, ranging in price from $50
to $150; just be sure you get one light enough for your Pom puppy
to push through. The easiest doors to install are those that work
with your sliding glass door because they just slide into place,
without requiring you to cut a hole in the door or wall.
The doggy door option also assumes a couple of factors:
 The door leads outside to an absolutely escape-proof kennel,
preferably with a top that prevents predators from getting in.
(The top prevents wild animals, including birds of prey, from
regarding your Pom pup as a potential snack. The top is also
secure from passersby who may try to steal a cute puppy.)
 Inside, the doggy-door is one side of a pen. The smaller you
can make the indoor area, the more it will be like your pup’s
den (see the earlier section “Deciding When and Where to
Housetrain Your Pom Pup” for a discussion on this important
area). If possible, fill most of the area with your pup’s crate,
removing the door or propping it open sturdily.
Young puppies catch on to the concept of doggy doors very
quickly. You can help her through the first few times, luring her
with treats and holding the flap partially open. Gradually require
her to push the flap open herself, and soon she’ll be letting herself
in and out!
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 209

Housetraining in Action
After you know the basics, it’s time to walk the walk and stop the
yuck. There’s only one thing missing: your puppy! In this section I
show you how to know when she’s gotta go and how to shape her
into a potty-trained pee-meister.
Recognizing when she’s gotta go
You can’t rely on the clock to tell you when a potty break’s immi-
nent, so watch your dog for signs of impending peeing or pooping.
Playing and exercising mean she’s also drinking more water, but
young puppies don’t give you too much of a clue that they’re about
to become walking geysers. Here are a few signs to watch for:
 She walks quickly in circles.
 When playing, she stops, then walks a few steps forward, then
stops again.
You have to be fast to catch her when she has to go, so a safer
bet is not to start indoor games unless she’s just urinated in
the proper place.
Puppies give you much more warning when they’re going to poop.
When you see these two signs, get your Pom to her potty area
right away:
 They usually start sniffing and circling.
 Very young puppies often whine.
When in doubt, take her out!
Instilling confidence by sticking
around for the potty party
Good parents don’t just shove a toddler into a bathroom and lock
the door behind him, expecting to achieve good results. He’d be
crying to get out or looking for some sort of mischief to get into,
but he definitely wouldn’t be getting potty trained!
The same is true of your puppy. You can’t just push him outside
and then let him back in five minutes later and think you’ve done
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
210

your part. Especially if the weather’s bad, he’s likely to spend that
time huddled against the door. Then when you let him back in, he
wets the floor. “Bad dog!” you exclaim. No — bad trainer!
You need to go outside with him every time as long as he’s still
training, no matter how bad the weather or how big your rush. And
as soon as he goes, you need to be ready to praise and reward him
for his astounding feat.
Even if you have a yard, be sure to practice with the dog on a leash
sometimes. Few moments are more frustrating than taking a trip
with a dog and suddenly discovering she doesn’t think she’s sup-
posed to potty while on a leash.
Rewarding potty performance
Sure, you can housetrain a dog without using rewards. But the
simple fact is that rewards make the job faster and easier. These
are the basics:
1. Go outside with her to the specific place you’ve chosen as
the potty area.
If you’ve been using sod squares inside (see the earlier sec-
tion “Using a grassy litter box”), plant one with her urine
scent on it as a scent signpost for her because dogs are
hardwired to mark the same territory more than once.
2. Ignore her if she tries to play.
She’s not out there for playtime.
3. After she potties, tell her what a good girl she is and give
her a reward from the stash of treats in your pocket.
You can move to another area of the yard and play so that
playtime is yet another reward for pottying in the right
place.
4. When she gets the hang of going in the right place, add a
cue (like “Hurry up”) as soon as she’s definitely going to
go (unless you happen to say that phrase a lot around the
house!). Reward her as usual afterward.
Soon she’ll associate the cue with the action, and you’ll
have a dog that can eliminate on cue! “Spend a penny” is
popular with people who want to sound old fashioned and
also not accidentally give the cue to potty in the wrong
place.
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 211

Overcoming Housetraining
Challenges
Housetraining is the single most difficult training task most people
have to face with any dog, and toy dogs in particular. The reasons
for this problem can vary. Many people raise toy dogs inside until
the dogs have formed bad ideas about the proper potty surface.
New owners tend to let their puppies have too much freedom.
(After all, how hard is it to clean up little puppy messes?) Then
again, it doesn’t help that toy dogs simply take longer than big
dogs to gain control over their bladders and bowels.
Whatever the case, don’t give up. Even if your dog takes longer to
housetrain than your friend’s dog, it will happen. However, if you
seem to make no progress, or if your dog is backsliding, you may
need to back up and start at square one, reverting to no unsuper-
vised freedom. Yes, it sees like a lot of work, but it’s really very little
compared to cleaning up for the next decade. And good training is
certainly better than banishing your dog to the laundry room.
Reacting constructively to accidents
You’ll probably find some puddles and poops inside that you never
saw your Pom deposit. Dragging her to the scene of the crime,
pointing, and rubbing her nose in it only tells her that every once
in a while, for no apparent reason, you lose your mind and turn on
her. Yelling, slapping, and generally going insane doesn’t get the
point across any better. In fact, it’s the perfect way to ruin a trust-
ing relationship. Your dog has no idea what your problem is,
because she can’t relate what she did ten minutes ago to what
you’re going on and on about now. (For more insight about punish-
ment and why it rarely works, see Chapter 15.)
Instead, follow up the deed with these moves of your own:
1. Hold your temper.
2. Clean up the mess.
And what to do if you catch your dog in the act, pottying inside the
house? Take these positive steps:
1. Make an abrupt noise, like “Arrgh” to get her attention.
2. Try to sweep her up and get her outside.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
212

She may not be able to stop midstream, so be careful she
doesn’t leave a pee-pee trail all the way to the door by
keeping lots of towels handy.
3. After she’s outside, ignore her until she relieves herself;
then reward her as usual.
4. Consider it a reminder that you need to watch her more
closely.
Understanding common medical
causes for potty problems
If your adult (over 1 year old) Pomeranian still isn’t housetrained —
or reverts back to having accidents when he’s housetrained —
have your veterinarian examine him to make sure a physical prob-
lem isn’t the cause. Some medical reasons are as follows:
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 213
Cleanup 101
Unless you’re Super Trainer, your puppy will have accidents. A place that smells
like urine or poop is a place that screams “Go here!” to your dog. To avoid repeat
performances, you need to get rid of as much of that scent signal as possible. (Of
course, you want to do that anyway for your own olfactory comfort!) Avoid ammo-
nia-based cleaners, which smell like urine and can act as an inadvertent welcome
sign to dogs.
To clean potty-soaked carpet:
1. Scoop up any droppings and soak up as much liquid as possible as quickly as
possible.
Your aim is to prevent it from reaching the carpet pad.
2. Add a little water and again soak up as much as possible.
If you have a rug-cleaning machine that extracts liquid, use it.
3. Apply an enzyme-digester odor neutralizer (a product specifically for dog acci-
dents), and leave it on for a long time, following directions.
Use enough neutralizer to penetrate the pad.
Note: Cover the area with plastic so the neutralizer doesn’t dry out before it can
break down the urine.
4. Add a nice odor like a mixture of lavender oil or vanilla with baking soda to the
area. Let it air out for a day, then vacuum.

 Urinary tract infections cause repeated urges to urinate with
little warning.
 Diabetes and kidney disease cause increased drinking along
with increased urination.
 Some drugs like steroids also cause increased drinking and
urination.
 Spayed females are more prone to urinary incontinence. Place
an absorbent pad under her when she sleeps.
 Geriatric dogs may forget their house manners and have
accidents.
 Internal parasites, gastrointestinal upsets, and some food
allergies can cause uncontrollable diarrhea.
Dealing with involuntary emissions
Have you ever been pee-in-your-pants scared? That’s one type of
involuntary emission — and your dog is even more susceptible to
pee that is out of her control. Even a trained dog can suffer from
some type of involuntary urine emission.
Submissive urination
Picture this: You come home, bend over to greet your sweet little
Pom, and what does she do? Squats and pees all over the floor! If
you’re living the nightmare, odds are that your Pom has a classic
case of submissive urination, which she’s doing in response to your
dominant signal of bending over her.
She can’t help it — and punishing her only makes the condition
worse. The good news is that she’ll probably outgrow the problem
if you help her. Avoid these actions that make her feel submissive:
 Bending over her
 Staring at her
 Scolding her
 Intimidating her in any other manner
Instead, keep your greetings calm, get down on her level, and for-
give and forget if she urinates. By teaching her a few tricks, you
can increase her confidence and give her a way to earn rewards.
Excitement urination
Some dogs just can’t help dribbling urine when they’re excited.
They, too, usually outgrow this excitement urination as they gain
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
214

bladder control. The best treatment is to decrease the excitement
level. To do this, greet your dog calmly and teach him to do some
simple tricks in exchange for treats. Also reward him just for being
calm. The goal is to train your dog by gradually conditioning him
to be calm during low-excitement events, working up gradually to
higher-excitement events. In addition, teach him some simple low-
key tricks to distract and calm him.
Punishing a dog with excitement urination only leads to his confu-
sion and possible submissive urination.
Tackling the not-so-involuntary
emissions
Is your Pom driving you crazy with general lack of housetraining or
with marking (when a sexually mature male dog lifts his leg to uri-
nate, thus marking his territory), and you’re thinking of banishing
him to the laundry room, garage, or outer space? You’re not alone,
and thankfully, solutions are available.
Absorbing the puddle
Enter the belly band for males. A belly band is, simply stated, a
band that goes around the belly with an absorbent pad strategi-
cally placed to catch any urine a male dog may aim in any direction
(see Figure 13-1). Replace the pad as needed, and your home is pee
free. These belly bands are available in many pet supply stores,
most dog catalogs, and in any toy dog specialty catalog.
For females, a belly band won’t work because the part she pees
with isn’t near her belly. Instead, try the panties they sell for
females in heat. Place an absorbent pad in the panty and change as
needed.
Whichever you use, change the pad frequently, and don’t use it in
place of proper housetraining efforts.
Discouraging the problem
Sometimes the smaller the dog, the more he tries to make a good
mark and the higher he tries to lift his leg.
The best cure is prevention by neutering before sexual maturity.
This step can’t guarantee that he won’t mark, but it greatly lessens
the chances. If he’s already sexually mature and has started mark-
ing, then neutering usually (but not always) helps alleviate the
problem.
Chapter 13: Saving the Carpets: Housetraining 215

Figure 13-1: A belly band for male dogs keeps your home pee free.
If you don’t want to neuter him, you may or may not be lucky, and
he may or may not be a marker. If you would like to make a million
dollars, invent a way to keep intact male dogs from marking.

N
obody likes a brat. Sure, the brat’s parents may think she’s
just so cute, but everybody else — humans and canines —
run at the sight of her. You don’t do your Pom any favors by letting
her become the brat everybody avoids, and trust me, even a small
dog can be a huge annoyance!
Fortunately, she doesn’t need to be a scholar to become polite. A
little home schooling, perhaps a short stint at a finishing school,
and she’s ready to hold her own in any social gathering.
But before you can train your Pomeranian, you’ll need to speak her
language as much as she’ll need to speak yours. What you don’t
want here is a failure to communicate.
Talking to Your Pom
Most people use such a mishmash of signals, it’s a wonder their
dogs haven’t attacked them in their sleep just for being so confus-
ing. The fact that dogs still manage to figure those signals out is a
testament to their patience and intelligence. But why not make it
easy on your dog?

Communicating with body language
The problem with communicating with your dog through body lan-
guage is that what seems right in people culture is often wrong in
dog culture. So follow these guidelines:
 Don’t stare at your dog. Dogs consider an unwavering direct
stare to be a threat. It can cause a dog that’s on the verge of
biting to attack in protest or, more often, in self defense.
Staring also can frighten a dog so she runs away or pees on
herself. Rather than staring, look off to the side a bit.
 Protect your Pom from strangers quickly approaching her.
When strange dogs meet each other, they sidle up sideways in
a circular motion to check each other out. Dogs that don’t dis-
play this approach send the message that they just may
attack. In the same way, dogs consider humans who stride
right up to be pushy and threatening. The dog may bite in self
defense, try to get away, or sink to the ground. If your dog
appears fearful, amble up and stop with your side facing her.
 When other people pet your Pom, have them scratch her
under the chin. Dogs consider a pat on the head or back to be
a sign of dominance. (A dominant dog would do this to a sub-
missive one.) So if your dog is already overly submissive, try
scratching her under her chin instead. It feels better to her, too.
 If you want your dog to come, turn your back to her and call
her as you walk away. Conversely, to stop her in her tracks,
you can turn toward her, make yourself look big, and take a
step or two toward her. Dogs consider somebody coming
toward them to be a signal to walk in the same direction and
stay out of the way. (A dominant wolf leads the pack this way.)
People tend to call dogs by facing them — and then wonder
why the dog trots away! She’s not being obstinate; in fact,
she’s being a perfect follower by wolf pack rules.
 Avoid hugging your dog. The closest dogs come to hugging is
when they hump each other in play, and then the humpee gen-
erally isn’t too thrilled. So when you hug your dog to make
her feel more secure, she sees it as a sign of dominance and
will likely try to squirm loose.
Speaking up: Using verbal 
skills correctly
Of course you also talk to your dog with words. If you’re like most
Pom owners, you babble an endless stream of words throughout
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
218

the day, and your Pom cocks his head knowingly. And even though
he seems to hang on to every one of your profound words, you can
be sure he’s actually trying to detect a magically important word —
like walk or eat — among the drivel.
Just as you need to be careful when you’re talking to people, heed
your speech when you’re talking to your dog. Your dog pays atten-
tion to the volume, tone, and cadence of your voice in addition to
the words themselves. Keep the following points in mind to maxi-
mize your verbal effectiveness:
 Pick one word for a command and stick with it. For example,
if you want your Pom to come when called, don’t use here,
come, come on, over here, here girl, and get your butt over here
right now before I come and get you! Pick one command
(preferably not that last one), and use it consistently.
 Pick unique command words. Make sure the words you
choose for one command don’t resemble other commands
or your dog’s name. For example, if your dog’s name is Sid,
you may find that “Sit” isn’t a good command cue. In such
cases, many people simply train their dogs to commands in a
foreign language — and showing off your bilingual dog is a lot
of fun, too!
 Be consistent with the sound as well as the word choice of
each cue. Dogs hear your cues as sounds, not as words that
have one meaning no matter how you say them.
 Teach your dog commands in a normal voice. Your Pom’s
hearing is far more sensitive than yours. If he doesn’t respond
to you, shouting at him won’t help unless he happens to be
half a mile away. In fact, shouting may intimidate him.
 Use a low-pitched voice to warn or scold your dog. In almost
every species, low-pitched sounds indicate power, aggression,
and leadership; they’re often used as threats. They make the
recipient take notice. If your dog is getting ready to run into
the road or do something wrong, lower your voice into your
best gruff command mode, and say “STOP!”
 Use a high-pitched voice to encourage your Pom to play.
High-pitched sounds make the recipient feel playful or domi-
nant. People naturally speak to dogs, especially puppies, in
the same high-pitched voice that parents around the world
use with their babies. This baby talk tends to encourage both
babies and dogs to interact and play.
Because the tone is nonthreatening, it’s also easy to ignore
(imagine a drill sergeant calling out commands in high-pitched
baby talk!). When you want your dog to stop, don’t use baby
talk.
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 219

 Mind the cadence of your words. People naturally change
their speech rhythm to communicate the response they want.
By becoming conscious of it, you can use your cadence to
influence your dog’s actions. Here are some examples:
• Long, drawn-out, monotone speech tends to slow or
calm a dog.
• Abrupt, low-pitched commands tend to stop a dog.
• A series of repeated, short, high-pitched sounds that
continue to rise in pitch tend to speed up a dog.
For example, if you want your dog to come running, you call,
“Go, go, go, go, go, GO!” with short, high-pitched sounds. After
he gets to you and starts to jump on you, you can say, “Ahght!
No!” in a low-pitched voice. Then to calm him down, you say,
“Eaaaasy, doooown” in a slow, monotone voice. Adjusting
your tone and cadence adds meaning to your words.
Understanding Your Pom
It’s not fair to expect your Pom to be the only one to learn a new
language. She’s also using body language and verbal language to
communicate to you. And because she can’t exactly dictate it or
tap it out on the keyboard, you’re duty bound as the supposedly
smarter member of the team to learn what’s she’s saying.
Reading your Pom’s body language
Take the time to watch your dog as well as other dogs; you’ll dis-
cover they’re speaking volumes with their body language and facial
expressions.
Putting all the clues together takes a little practice, but as you get
to know your Pom and her reactions, reading her body language
will become second nature. Of course, you have to listen to her,
too. But more on listening later in this chapter. For now, just watch.
Notice how she moves and stands around other dogs. See Table 14-1
for a variety of these movements and their meanings.

Translating Pom talk
Dogs do more than bark. They whine, growl, pant, hum, and howl.
And all those sounds mean something different! Many new dog
owners are alarmed when they hear their cute little Pomeranian
growl like a saber-toothed tiger. But growling is a natural part of
her vocabulary, and not all growls are created equal. The next time
your Pom starts to bark or growl, don’t shush her — at least not
right away. Take the time to understand what she’s saying. Table
14-2 translates a few common Pom sounds.

Providing the Motivation 
for Training and Tricks
Want to know what makes your dog tick? In truth, it’s not all that
different from what motivates you. Learning for canines and
humans is about cause and effect.
Although you really can teach an old dog new tricks, it’s even
easier to teach a new dog old tricks. Puppies can learn simple
things like “come” at just a few weeks of age and “sit” by 7 weeks
or so. The earlier your puppy learns to learn, the easier it will be to
train him throughout his life.
Rewarding with treats
When you do something that pays off, you try to do it again to get
that same payoff. That payoff may be money, a chance to relax, a
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
222

good meal, or any number of rewards. The payoff works the same
way for your dog, except that it’s likely to be a tasty treat, a chance
to play, or — to a lesser extent — praise from you.
Are treats really a good idea? Maybe your dog should mind you
simply for a kind word and a scratch under the chin. True, kind
words and scratches help, but would you go to work every day if
that was all you got? How long would you stay at a job if you got a
gold star and a pat on the back but no paycheck? Dogs are materi-
alistic, too.
If you need more convincing, consider the dogs and other animals
that do all those amazing feats in movies, circuses, and other per-
formances. They’re exchanging tricks for treats.
For most dogs, the way to their brains is through their stomachs.
But some dogs also consider the chance to chase a ball or play tug
equally rewarding. Dogs place different values on different
rewards, and they know what their work is worth. For example:
 They may consider a piece of kibble fair pay for a few feet of
walking on a leash but not for a whole string of tricks.
 Your dog expects a bigger reward for doing something she
doesn’t enjoy compared to the payment for something she
does enjoy.
 If your dog’s behavior is slacking, maybe she doesn’t approve
of the pay structure. Don’t be stingy when it comes to rewards!
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 223
Training isn’t wasted on the young
Young puppies are ready to accept the rules of their new world, and if those rules
include doing a trick or two in exchange for a treat, that seems normal to them.
Some research indicates that dogs are more receptive to reward-based training
when they’re puppies than at any other time in their lives.
In terms of learning ability, an 8-week-old puppy’s behavior and brainwaves func-
tion at nearly adult levels. In fact, a puppy’s ability to learn actually decreases slightly
beyond the age of 16 weeks. This means that if you wait until your pup is older for
his first lessons, he’s more likely to be confused and intimidated by this bizarre new
game you’ve devised.
You don’t have to teach him to count, but a simple trick or command can get the
idea of a trick for a treat across. Tricks learned at this young age tend to stick with
a dog through life, though, so make that trick a handy one!

The old school of dog training warned that if you started training
your dog with treats, you’d have to give your dog treats forever or
he wouldn’t cooperate. They had a good point. Nobody likes a pay
cut — and most dogs consider going from treats to praise to be a
serious cut in pay.
When you substitute praise for tangible rewards, the dog either
quits work or figures he’s doing something wrong. Result? He tries
to come up with some different way of doing what you’ve asked.
You start to think he’s bored, stubborn, or stupid, but really, he’s
disappointed and confused. Keep these guidelines in mind for man-
aging your pup’s rewards:
 Avoid spending the rest of your life as a walking treat dispenser
by giving treats sometimes but giving praise all the time. So
you either give praise and then treat or give praise alone.
 The way you choose to schedule rewards can have important
implications for your dog’s learning. Just like people, a Pom’s
performance depends on whether she’s paid by the hour or
the job. You want her to work by the job!
When you first teach her a trick, reward her every time she
does it right. But after she knows it, cut back gradually, reward-
ing her only some of the time but still praising every time.
Like a slot machine, pay off at random times so she’s always
wondering whether the next time will be the jackpot. And in
fact, you can add special jackpot rewards to really keep her
working.
 If you train your dog before her regular meal time, she works
much better for food. In fact, you can simply dole out her
dinner bit by bit as rewards during training sessions. If you’re
in a hurry, just train for a few minutes, give a few rewards, and
then give a jackpot of her entire meal.
Clicking to show your praise
Hang around a group of successful dog trainers in action and you’ll
start wondering what all these clicking sounds are about. They’re
using clicker training, which works very well with most animals,
including dogs.
A click is merely a signal that tells your Pom he’s doing something
right. Why not just say “Good dog”? Because your dog can tune out
much of what you say, but he’s more likely to notice a distinctive
signal. In addition,
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
224

 By following the click sound with a reward, your dog quickly
learns that the click means “Yes, that’s it!”
 Because the click is faster and shorter than your voice, it
can more precisely mark the moment your dog is doing some-
thing right.
 The click tells the dog that he can end the behavior — so
don’t expect him to continue after you click.
 After he understands how to do something, you can phase out
the click but not the praise and rewards.
You can buy an inexpensive clicker device from any pet supply
store or use anything that makes a distinctive click sound. You can
even make a cluck sound with your mouth — just make sure you
don’t use the same sound in situations other than training.
To train with a clicker, follow these steps:
1. Have lots of tiny treats on hand.
2. Begin clicking and then give your dog a treat so she
learns that a click means a treat is coming.
Repeat this step (at least 20 times) until she looks at your
treat hand expectantly after she hears the click.
3. Give a click instantly when your dog does what you want.
The faster you click, the easier it is for her to figure out
what you like.
4. Give a reward as soon as you can after the click.
5. Always praise and pet your Pom as part of the reward!
No dog performs perfectly at first. You have to gradually teach her,
shaping her behavior closer and closer to your expectations.
Schooling Your Pom in Manners
and Obedience
When your puppy realizes that his actions are related to treats,
you have a good foundation for further training. And if you have
plans to enter your Pom in competitions involving obedience,
agility, or even tracking, this is the best time to introduce him to
some of those behaviors.
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 225

New training methods focus on rewards and positive associations.
They produce happy, well-trained dogs that are eager to learn more.
With the positive methods I outline here, you just use a buckle
collar (you don’t tug on it), a 6-foot leash (not chain!), and maybe a
20-foot light line.
To get started on the right foot (or feet, as the case may be), keep
the following suggestions in mind:
 Train in a quiet place away from distractions. You can gradu-
ally start practicing in other places after your dog has learned
a skill very well.
 If your dog is tired, hot, or has just eaten, hold off on the
training. You want her peppy and hungry for your fun and
treats.
 If you’re impatient or angry, wait until you’re in a better
mood. You won’t be able to hide your frustration, and your
dog will be uneasy.
 Keep your training sessions very short. Dogs learn best in 
10- to 15-minute sessions. Quit while she’s still having fun
and performing well. You can train her several times a day if
you want.
If you plan to clicker train (see the previous section), introduce it
in your first training sessions.
Of course, most Poms have the important job of being an owner’s
best friend. For this responsibility, he needs to know some basic
obedience, some house rules, and even the best ways to play and
cuddle.
Sitting pretty
For a quick trick, teach your pup a simple sit-and-stay. This trick
won’t exactly amaze your friends, but at least it’ll be handy.
Forget the old smash-his-rear-down-and-pull-up-on-his-collar tech-
nique. Poms have enough knee problems without you putting
added stress on them, and nobody likes to be forced. The train-
ing’s more effective when you get him to sit on his own. Follow
these steps:
1. Place your puppy on a raised surface, or sit on the floor
with him, with one hand behind his butt to prevent him
from backing up.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
226

Otherwise he’s too likely to spend all his time trying to
jump up on you.
2. Hold a treat just above and behind his nose, right above
his eyes, so he has to bend his hind legs to look up at it.
Click and reward.
3. Repeat Step 2 several times.
4. Begin moving the treat farther back each time so he has
to bend his legs more and eventually has to sit.
Don’t shove his rear to the ground! Just wait and demand
that he go a little farther down each time before he gets the
treat. Eventually he’ll automatically sit when he sees you
move the treat back.
5. Start saying “Sit” right before you show him the treat;
only give him the treat when he sits after you say “Sit.”
If you give the treat if he sits without the cue word, he’ll
just sit whenever he feels like it, not when you ask him. Say
his name before the cue word to alert him that the next
word is directed at him.
6. Gradually fade out luring with the treat so you use just
your empty hand and eventually just your command.
Be sure to continue rewarding him afterward, though.
He’s probably wondering how he can con you out of more treats.
Fortunately, you know plenty of ways, starting with standard obe-
dience commands.
Staying put
What’s the use of teaching your dog to sit if she jumps back up like
the floor is electrified? By teaching a separate stay command, you
can convince her to stay in any position, whether she’s sitting,
lying down, or standing up.
Because staying is essentially asking her to do nothing, you teach
it a different way than you teach sit and most other commands:
 You introduce the cue word “Stay” immediately. Otherwise
how does she know the difference between a sit, where you
forgot to reward her, and this new behavior?
 You don’t use a clicker (see the earlier section “Clicking to
show your praise). Staying is an imprecise behavior that
relies on duration, not action. Because the clicker normally
signals the end of the behavior, the dog assumes she is free to
get up for her reward . . . hello! I said “Stay.”
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 227

So you teach stay the old-fashioned way:
1. Say “Stay” to your sitting dog and hold your palm in a
stop signal in front of his face for a few seconds.
2. Reward him and say “Okay!” (the release signal that says
he’s free to move about the cabin).
If your dog isn’t getting the concept, have him sit on a
raised surface or behind a small barrier so it’s more diffi-
cult for him to come to you.
3. Work up gradually to a longer duration of the stay.
If he gets up, simply put him back in position and start
over, decreasing the duration you expect of him.
4. Move to different positions around your dog (in front of,
to either side, and behind), still remaining close. Repeat
Steps 2 and 3.
5. Move farther away from him. Repeat Steps 2 and 3.
Give a reward, then use a release word like “Okay!” to tell
him he can get up.
Lying down on the job
Having a dog that lies down quietly is a big help when you want
her to stay in the room and impress your guests, or when you take
her to an outdoor café that allows dogs, or anytime you need her
to stay in place and out of the way.
Instead of trying to push her down to the floor until she gives up
struggling (good grief!), try this kinder, gentler way:
1. Have her sit on a raised surface. Show her a treat and
move it toward the ground (see Figure 14-1).
You may need to gently place your other hand on her
shoulders to prevent her from popping up.
2. As soon as she lowers her front legs, click (see the section
“Clicking to show your praise”) and reward her.
3. Repeat Step 2, clicking and rewarding for going farther
down until her elbows touch the surface she’s sitting on.
4. Repeat Step 1 but without a treat in the hand you’ve been
using to lure her. Gradually abbreviate your hand move-
ments until you’re only using a small hand signal.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
228

Figure 14-1: Luring a dog into a down.
5. Add the verbal cue “Down” right before the hand signal.
6. Practice the down-stay just as you did the sit-stay (see the
two previous sections for these commands).
Coming when called
If your Pom learns only one command, it should be to come when
called, and the best time to teach him is when he’s still a puppy.
No doubt he already has a good idea of the command. After all, he
probably comes scampering when you call him to eat or do some-
thing else he thinks is fun.
You can use this same command to make sure he comes running
every time you call. A great way to teach the command is with
the help of a friend and a long hallway or other enclosed area.
Here’s how:
1. Have your friend hold your dog while you back away,
enticing your dog with a treat or toy.
2. When the dog pulls to get to you, the helper releases him
so he can run to you.
You can even turn and run away to increase your pup’s
enthusiasm.
3. The moment he reaches you, click (see the section
“Clicking to show your praise”) and then give him the
treat or toy.
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 229

4. Gradually require him to let you catch him before giving
him the reward.
Some dogs come but then dance just out of your reach
while you gradually turn purple with frustration.
5. Eventually add the cue “Come!” just before your helper
releases him. Practice this several times for many sessions.
6. Let him meander around on his own after he’s learned to
come on cue. Call “Come!” and reward him as before.
If he doesn’t come, try attaching a long, light line to him to
give him a hint.
7. Practice in lots of different places, gradually choosing
places with more distractions.
Always keep him on a long, light line for his safety.
Always make coming to you rewarding. If you want your dog to
come so you can give her a bath or put her to bed or do anything
else she isn’t keen about, go get her instead of calling her. If you do
call her, make sure you give her a good reward before moving on to
the part she doesn’t like. Never call her to you to punish her. She’s
not stupid and will quickly learn to go the other way!
Walking the floor
Your Pom was born with feet for a reason — so he can walk on
them and not be carried in your arms all the time. But many Pom
owners think those four appendages are some evolutionary ves-
tiges of extraneous structures, so they insist on carrying their dogs
everywhere. My advice: Don’t do it. Your Pom needs to know how
to walk like a dog.
But getting your Pom to walk with you — without pulling or
twirling, or weaving between your feet, prancing in front of you,
and tripping you — doesn’t come naturally. You’d like him to walk
politely by your side — in other words, to heel.
The heel position is the best place to keep your Pom out of the
way when walking with you. Heel position is on your left side, next
to you but not crowding you, with his neck about even with your
leg. If you plan to attend obedience classes or even trials, heeling
will play a big part in your Pom’s overall performance.
Like the other commands you want your pup to learn, heeling is
most easily mastered when you take deliberate but gradual steps.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
230

From collar to leash
Leash training is the first step toward heeling and often the pup’s
introduction to formal training. To begin, place a simple buckle
collar around her neck, tight enough so that she can’t get her
bottom jaw around it, but loose enough so that you can get a finger
or two between it and her neck. (It may feel funny to your pup
at first, so she may scratch or bite at it.) As soon as she stops fidg-
eting with it, give her a treat. Then lure her so she gets used to
walking with you, still off the leash. Soon — and how long will vary
from one minute to one week — she’ll ignore the collar and walk
with you around the house or yard as you dole out treats. At this
point you can attach the leash.
If she decides somewhere along the way that she’s supposed to
object to this leash, she may freeze, flip over, or just lie down.
Unfortunately, many traditional trainers believe you should drag
the dog along as you walk, but that’s not good. Instead, pick your
pup up, change directions, and encourage her to walk again, step
by step. Take a walk to the kitchen and hand out a jackpot reward.
Then take her back and do it again. End the session while she still
wants more.
From leash to short walks
Start practicing walking on a leash in your yard or house. Only
when she’s reliable here should you set your goals on short walks
out in the real world.
Your Pom will find everything fascinating on these first walks. In
fact, she may become so excited that she leaps at the end of the
leash, twirling and voicing her frustration that her human anchor
is preventing her from going where she pleases. You can put a stop
to this by doing the following:
1. Stand in place when she starts to tug.
2. Click (see the section “Clicking to show your praise”) and
reward her when she lets the leash go slack.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2, stopping, standing, and waiting
until she stops pulling as soon as you stop walking.
4. Walk toward something that she wants to get to, such as
a tree.
5. Stand in place if she pulls. When she stops pulling, go
toward the goal again.
Reaching the goal is her eventual reward, but the only way she can
reach it is to stop pulling!
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 231

Pom-sized training
Training a little dog to heel has a couple of special challenges:
 Problem: Because the leash is so far above the dog, he can
arc out in many directions so you have very little control over
his exact position.
Solution: Try stringing the leash through a section of PVC
pipe. The pipe should reach from your left hand to just above
your dog’s collar. Now he has very little slack in which to
maneuver, and you can control his position precisely. Train
him by guiding him into place, then clicking and rewarding
him. Gradually guide him less, only rewarding when he
assumes heel position on his own. When he consistently
heels, add the cue word, “Heel!”
 Problem: Getting a treat to him in a timely manner may be dif-
ficult especially if you plan to use treats to lure him into heel
position. Not everybody can bend to give a treat time after
time, and you don’t want to throw treats on the floor because
that teaches him to sniff the floor in search of food all the
time.
Solution: One solution is to attach a spoon or paper plate to
the end of a stick. Slather peanut butter or squeeze cheese on
the spoon or plate. Train him by holding the spoon or plate in
front of him until you’ve lured him into heel position. Let him
take a lick only when he is in that position. Eventually hold the
target only in the heel position so he has to come to position
on his own to get the reward. Add the cue, “Heel!” Gradually
raise the stick so it isn’t always there, but lower it after he’s in
position. Your goal is to fade the stick away altogether.
You probably can’t handle the PVC leash guide and the treat stick
at the same time, so you may have just figure out which works best
for you.
No matter which way you choose to train, make staying in heel
position a game by running and turning, clicking, and rewarding
when she is able to stick to your side. Just be careful not to trip
over her!
Even though your Pom should know how to walk on her own four
feet in public, it’s not always the best idea. If you’re in a crowd, or
some place where other dogs could reach her, carry her in your
arms or put her in a carrying bag for her protection.

232

Teaching Your Pom 
a Bagful of Tricks
Knowing how to sit, lie down, come, heel, and stay on command
are vital lessons for your Pom to learn. But they’re not exactly
going to astound anyone. Besides, if you’ve taught your dog using
rewards, she’s probably itching to learn more. And that’s when a
few dog tricks come in handy!
The number of tricks you teach is limited only by your imagination
and your dog’s physical abilities. But you can start with some stan-
dard favorites such as shake hands, roll over, and spin in a circle,
and then see where you go from there.
What a greeting! Shaking hands
Every well-bred Pomeranian knows how to greet guests at formal
affairs by offering her paw. Here’s how to teach yours:
1. Have her sit facing you.
2. Reach for her right paw with your right hand.
3. Praise and reward her if she gives you her paw naturally.
4. Add the cue words “How do you do?” or some such
phrase. Give her your hand and reward her only when
she shakes on cue.
If she doesn’t offer her paw, have her sit facing you and then do the
following:
1. Use a treat to lure her head way to the left so she’s almost
looking over her shoulder.
This step makes her right paw lift.
2. Praise and reward her as soon as her paw goes up.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 until she lifts her paw when the lure
is close to her head and eventually at only the sight of
the treat.
4. Add the cue words “How do you do?” or some such
phrase. Give her your hand and reward her only when
she shakes on cue.
Chapter 14: Mastering Manners and Basic Commands 233

Stop, drop, and roll, dog-style
No dog trick repertoire is complete without rolling over.
Fortunately, it’s easy to teach.
1. Have your Pom lie down beside you.
2. Show him a treat and move it over his back so he has to
twist his head over his shoulder to see it. Give him the
treat.
3. Have him twist a little more in order to get the next treat.
4. Keep on expecting him to twist more and more until he
eventually ends up rolling onto his side.
You can help a bit at this point with a gentle nudge to keep
him going until he’s on his back.
5. Keep moving the treat to the opposite side so he has to
finish the roll and end up back on his stomach before get-
ting the treat.
6. Add the cue “Roll over!” when he can do a complete roll
easily.
Only reward him for rolling over on cue. You can keep on
adding roll after roll. Just don’t get him too dizzy!
Speaking when called upon
Teach a dog to bark? Is somebody insane? Don’t dogs bark enough
on their own? Yes, but consider the logic: When your dog learns to
bark on cue, he also learns that barking on his own isn’t very
rewarding. Follow these steps to teach your Pom to speak:
1. Figure out what makes him bark.
The best situation is if he barks at you for a treat.
2. Click and reward him when he barks.
3. Introduce the cue word “Speak!” quickly for this trick.
You don’t want to reward him for speaking out of turn!

N
o matter how perfect your dog’s parents, no matter how won-
derful his puppyhood, and no matter how hard you work to
socialize and train him, your dog will do something you don’t like.
Considering that 90 percent of all dog owners report a behavioral
problem, you’re lucky if your dog’s bad behavior is only a nui-
sance. If you’re not so lucky, it’s a more serious behavior that dis-
rupts his or your life. Fortunately, you don’t have to live with it.
In this chapter, I preview the top complaints of Pom owners and
guide you through combatting each one. But — and this is a big
but — one thing you don’t get from me is advice on how to punish
your Pom. Why? Because as a scientist trained in animal behavior,
I strongly disagree with the use of punishment in dealing with bad
behavior. After all, your dog just needs some coaxing in the right
direction — a little positive reinforcement, if you will. And that’s
just what I help you offer for each of the predicaments in this chap-
ter. First, though, I dive a bit deeper into the punishment versus
positive reinforcement debate to start your training efforts on a
solid foundation.

Squelching Bad Behavior: 
The Two Major Methods
Like you, your Pom learns from experience. She’s more likely to do
things that make good things happen or bad things go away and
less likely to do things that make bad things happen or good things
go away. That’s actually the entire crux of training. The hard part is
bringing this into play in real life.
Of these choices, it’s easiest to make good things happen (reward)
or make bad things happen (punishment). In this section, I com-
pare the pros and cons of reward versus punishment. Here’s a hint:
Sparing the rod will not spoil the Pom.
Understanding the pitfalls 
of punishment
It’s human nature to want to lash out when somebody, even a cute
little Pom, destroys your belongings or does something wrong. It
may make you feel better for a second while you blow off steam.
But it won’t help you feel better a few minutes later, and it sure
won’t help your dog to shape up. In fact, lashing out can undo all
your other good training efforts.
I strongly advise against using punishment to shape your Pom’s
behavior for several reasons, among them the following:
 Punishment doesn’t tell a dog what to do; rather, it tells a
dog what not to do. Anyone who’s ever tried to follow
instructions of any sort can understand how frustrating this
not-so-helpful type of guidance is. Eventually a dog will quit
trying to figure out what you want altogether.
 The timing of the punishment is usually too late to be effec-
tive. In reality, a dog usually has dug several holes or barked a
few thousand times before the owner decides to do something
about it, but in order to be effective, the punishment needs to
happen immediately after the infraction.
 It can cause aggressive behavior. Although severe punish-
ment has long been the advice for dogs that show signs of
aggression, in most cases, it’s the worst response because it
can actually cause aggressive behavior. Just like in humans,
pain can make a dog want to strike out and direct that aggres-
sion back toward the source.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
236

 It can lead to some unwanted behaviors that may be related
to emotional aspects of flight-or-fight. Examples are
• A dog that runs away when situations remind her of
punishment
• A dog that’s fearful of punishment so she avoids you or
snaps at you because she’s scared
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 237
And you thought you were being clear
The key to training is communication, and too often, what you have with punish-
ment is a failure to communicate. Pity the poor pup who has to decipher your mixed
messages in the following situations:

That doesn’t mean punishment never works. The problem is that it
only works under specific situations, and more often than not,
those guidelines aren’t met when you punish your dog. For punish-
ment to work, it ideally needs to follow these ground rules:
 It’s severe enough to offset the rewards of the infraction.
 It happens immediately after the infraction.
 It happens the first time the infraction occurs.
For example, if a dog jumps up, puts his paws on a hot burner, and
gets burned the first time he does it, he doesn’t do it again because
the circumstances follow the three ground rules.
Considering the best approach:
Positive behavior training
If punishment doesn’t work, then what does? You can’t just let
your Pom run amok, doing as she pleases. Well, not too much,
anyway. Think positive: What can you do to make your dog have
rewarding experiences? Doling out treats, playing with toys, or
going for a walk are all things likely to turn your Pom on. And how
can you make those experiences relate to her good behavior?
Always be ready with a treat, toy, and special caress when your
Pom makes the slightest bit of progress.
Exactly how you reward your dog’s behavior will depend in part on
what you’re trying to get him to do — or not do.
Helping a Fearful Dog Be Brave
Dogs appear to be gregarious and brave animals in general, but in
fact, many dogs have fear issues. Living in fear robs your dog (and
you as his companion!) from engaging in lots of normal, fun activi-
ties and puts him at risk for panic-running, fear-biting, and high
stress levels.
Fearfulness can be inborn, but it also may be the result of poor
socialization or a traumatic event during puppyhood. You can
address fearfulness by training, drugs, or both. The type of fear
your dog exhibits determines which method(s) works best. Keep
these two distinctions in mind:
 A dog with generalized fear is more likely to have a genetic pre-
disposition and is less likely to benefit from training. Medication
or general socialization may be the best bet in such cases.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
238

 A dog with a specific fear is more likely to be suffering the con-
sequences of a specific event; he’s more likely to be helped
through behavior modification than with medication.
Training away the fear
Dogs with a specific fear are most often afraid of strange people,
strange dogs, the veterinary clinic, and loud noises. Dog trainers
use one of two main training techniques to minimize the fear:
desensitization and flooding. The most effective training technique
to minimize fear is the desensitization method. (Because I don’t
advocate the flooding method, I cover it for your information in the
sidebar “Freaking out your dog on purpose: Flooding.”)
The best way to reduce a dog’s fearfulness is to go slow and easy.
Your goal is to end each session with your dog relatively nonfear-
ful. This means either you undertake marathon sessions that last
so long that your dog is finally used to the situation or you provide
short sessions with milder situations where exposure to a fearful
event doesn’t overwhelm your dog.
To help your dog build confidence and a feeling of control, follow
these general guidelines:
 Gradually expose him to whatever it is he’s afraid of. For
example, if he’s afraid of strange dogs, start so far away from
one dog that he just barely notices it. Then the next day —
and only if he’s calm — move a little closer.
Your dog is learning to be calm. If he’s still afraid at the end of
a session, you’ve only reinforced his fear. You’ve pushed him
too hard, or you didn’t expose him long enough. Because stay-
ing long enough might mean pitching a tent, my advice is to
back off next time and go more slowly.
 Prevent inappropriate responses. Keep your dog from biting,
running away, and so on out of fear. Instead, if he looks like
he’s going to freak out, get his attention and have him do a
simple trick. Then reward him for the trick by moving away
from whatever he wanted to get away from. This step gives
him some control while teaching him that looking to you for
leadership is the best solution.
 Encourage responses incompatible with fear. Rather than
just have your dog stand there and think about how scared he
is, get him to do something like relaxing, eating, playing, hunt-
ing, or walking. This way he begins to associate good events
and feelings with the feared object.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 239

An example of this strategy is taking your dog for a walk with
another person if your dog is afraid of strangers. Allowing him
to focus on the walk — and have fun with the stranger — is
better than just standing there while a stranger pets him.
 Let him see other dogs and you behaving appropriately. If
your dog is afraid of strangers but has a doggy buddy, he may
be encouraged to join in the greetings if his best doggy friend
is getting petted and eating treats from a stranger.
Your dog can take cues from you as well. When he acts fearful,
avoid clutching him to you, pulling on the leash, or coddling
him. Instead, act jolly, like there’s nothing at all to be afraid of.
Have him do a trick if you really want to pet and reward him,
so he earns it.

The common alternative to desensitization is flooding, a practice in which you
expose your dog to his fear at superhigh levels and for extended periods of time.
The logic presumes that normal levels of the feared event, then, will seem like noth-
ing in comparison. The result doesn’t turn out that way, but, unfortunately, dog train-
ers still try this method all the time.
For example, is the dog afraid of people? A trainer that uses the flooding method
would take the dog to a shopping center and hold him while everybody and any-
body who goes by can pet him. The only problem is that this approach works no
better than locking a person in a room with spiders. You’re likely to end up with a dog
really afraid of people — and shopping centers.
Flooding is ineffective for two reasons:
 The dog has no control over her own well-being, and having no control
increases her anxiety and fear. In fact, when dogs are unsuccessful at escap-
ing the situation, they often turn to the only control left to them — growling or
biting in self-defense. The horrified owner then typically punishes the dog and
may even decide the dog can’t be trusted, so he gives up the dog.
 The process depends on the dog becoming so accustomed to the feared object
that she can’t maintain her level of fearfulness. In truth, that process would
usually take many hours, if not days, and most people don’t wait that long.
Instead, they spend an hour at the shopping center for petting (tormenting, in the
dog’s view). The dog may eventually give up her attempts to escape, but her
fear probably doesn’t diminish much. She leaves the shopping center knowing
three facts: She can’t escape from these strange people; her owner won’t help
her; and the shopping center is a very scary place. When her owner takes her
back the following week for round two, she’s even more scared.

In addition to the general guidelines, these tips can help in specific
situations:
 Fear of strange people: Select the people you want her to
meet. Instruct them to stop a short way from the dog, not
looking at her, not even facing her. They should ignore her
while you talk or walk with them. Let them offer a treat, again
without looking at the dog, and let the dog make the
approaches. Remember to proceed gradually.
 Fear of strange dogs: Walk the dogs together, with the other
dog on a leash, of course, held by his owner. Keep the other
dog from getting in a position where he can chase your dog by
keeping them both on leashes.
 Fear of the veterinary clinic: Take her for short visits to the
clinic’s waiting room. Just pop in and back out; then go for a
ride in the car to a place she really likes.
 Fear of thunder and other loud noises: Fear of thunder is a
difficult phobia to treat because you can’t control how loud
the booms are. In many cases, drug therapy is needed so the
dog can experience being calm during a thunderstorm.
For other loud noises (such as gun shots), try to drown out the
bangs with loud music. For some reason, this seldom works for
thunder; dogs seem to be able to sense the thunder through
the music. But you can try. If loud noises are an ongoing prob-
lem, you can help your dog deal with them by gradually expos-
ing him to louder and louder noises and rewarding him for
calm behavior, just as you would for any other fearful thing.
Medicating away the fear
Prescribing drugs to dogs for behavioral problems may not seem
natural. But in fact, drug therapy is often an attempt to bring a
dog’s chemicals that affect behavior back into normal balance. The
most commonly prescribed drugs for dogs are antianxiety drugs,
which may help with fear- or separation-related behaviors. They
must be prescribed by a veterinarian.
The best use of drugs is in tandem with training, not in place of it.
Sometimes a short regime of antianxiety drugs can help your dog
be calm during training. This assistance is especially beneficial if
he’s too fearful to make any progress. Drugs aren’t usually a long-
term answer, but in conjunction with desensitization, they can help
work wonders and are certainly a better alternative than letting
your dog live in fear.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 241

I don’t go into a lot of detail about drug therapy here, mainly
because that’s a job for a veterinarian, preferably one with specific
training in behavior problems. Certain drugs work better for cer-
tain problems, and they know which ones. Remember, in this day
and age, it’s no stigma for your dog to be on doggy downers or
puppy uppers!
Combating Separation Anxiety
You come back from a hard day at work, open the door, and
gasp. Vandals! Your home has been ransacked by vandals! Your
Pomeranian dances at your feet. The poor guy must have tried his
best to stop them. He’s panting and shaking, and it looks like he’s
drooled all over himself. You call the police and then start

The field of fixing doggy 
behavior problems
If your dog has a serious behavior problem, especially one that has you consider-
ing giving him up or even euthanizing him (behavior problems are some of the most
common reasons for these choices), your veterinarian may be a source of behav-
ior information.
However, because veterinarians are expected to keep up-to-date in many fields
covering several species, they can’t be specialists in every field. So, for serious
behavioral problems, a certified clinical behaviorist can be of more help. Clinical
behaviorists are trained in diagnostics and treatment and have the advantage of
being able to recognize and treat organic problems such as brain tumors, epilepsy,
and chemical imbalances that may be responsible for behavior problems.
Professional canine behaviorists are often satirized in movies as asking dogs about
their dreams or showing dogs inkblots, but in fact, these behaviorists are usually
highly trained veterinarians with specialized training in behavior or animal behav-
iorists with PhDs. They work with animals that have behavior problems using the
latest animal behavior, behavior modification, and drug knowledge. Your veterinar-
ian can consult with one or refer you to one in your area (go to www.avma.org/
education/abvs/vetspecialists.asp for a listing of diplomats of the
American College of Veterinary Behaviorists).
Your dog’s obedience instructor also may be a source of information. Like veteri-
narians, dog trainers vary widely in their levels of behavioral training. Look for a
trainer who is a member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (www.apdt.com)
and is certified through the Certification Council for Pet Dog Trainers
(www.ccpdt.org).

inspecting the damage. Funny thing — these vandals appear to
have clawed and bitten everything. And that scrap of sofa stuck on
your dog’s tooth? Indisputable evidence. This was an inside job —
the vandal is your panicked Pomeranian.
When this scenario happens time after time, it’s most likely one of
the most common canine behavioral problems, separation anxiety.
A dog with separation anxiety is stressed, and in many cases, she’s
trying to find her owner. She only knows that her owner’s gone, so
she often does the following:
 Center a lot of her destruction on exits, trying to dig under
doors, peel screens from windows, or chew through door
frames
 Gets so upset that she urinates and defecates on the floor
and then spreads it around as she paces back and forth in
agitation
 Barks or howls, calling for her owner and angering the
neighbors
But you don’t see all this. All you see is red!
Instead of punishing her, you’re better off turning around and sit-
ting outside to cool off first. Your dog isn’t doing this to spite you.
Although she appears to look guilty, she’s actually scared because
she saw you go crazy the last time you came home after she had
done this. As much as she wanted you to return, now she slinks
away in fear.
Separation anxiety tends to get worse, not better, on its own. But if
you can’t wring her neck, how can you get through to her? Strange
as it may sound, it will take you changing many of your behaviors.
This is your starter kit:
 Start with short times away. Leave for only short periods —
maybe a minute — at first. Your goal is to return before your
dog has a chance to get upset. Work up to longer times gradu-
ally, repeating each level several times before moving to a
longer period of absence, always using your I’ll be right back
cue (see the later bullet).
You want her to associate the cue with feeling calm. If you
must be gone longer than your dog can tolerate, don’t give
her the I’ll be right back cue (see the later bullet in this list).
You don’t want to lie to her.
 Downplay departures. Make the difference between you
being home or gone as subtle as possible — no long farewells
and as few cues as possible that you’re leaving.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 243

Common cues are putting on your shoes, picking up the car
keys, or turning off the television. Instead, rattle the keys and
turn the television off at random times throughout the day
when you’re not going anywhere.
 Use an I’ll be right back cue. You can also give your dog a
cue that tells her you won’t be gone long — spray some air
freshener in the room, turn on a radio (if you don’t usually
have one on), or put down a special bed. Incorporate one or
more of these cues into your short-time departures (see the
first bullet in this list).
 Return nonchalantly. Nobody but a dog can greet you after a
ten-minute absence like you’ve just been on a trip around the
world. But for now, keep the reunion low key. Ignore her until
she’s calm. Even better, give her a cue to do a trick and then
reward her for that to take the focus off your return.
 Find a safe place. If you need to leave your dog for a long
time, play it smart and place her where she can’t do much
harm. You may need to crate her or place her in an exercise
pen (see Chapters 5 and 13 for details).
These options don’t help cure her problem — they just con-
fine the range of destruction. And confinement isn’t a long-
term solution. Eventually some dogs come to associate the
crate or pen with being left, and they become anxious as soon
as they have to go in them.
 Consider antianxiety aids — for your dog. Antianxiety or
antidepressant drugs may help dogs that are extremely
stressed. Usually you must give these drugs on a continuous
basis, not just when you’re leaving. However, you may need to
add some drugs for the treatment of panic when the dog is
going to be left alone.
As with all drug therapy, this decision should be made with
the guidance of a clinical behaviorist.
 Consider getting a canine companion for her. Most separa-
tion anxiety focuses on the presence or absence of people, not
dogs. For the older puppy or adult dog, a person is the pri-
mary caretaker and essentially takes the place of a parent. But
sometimes another dog can help alleviate separation anxiety.
Calming a Ping-Pong Pom
Pomeranians, despite their small size, are energetic dogs. They can
race back and forth in your house, jump up and down at your feet,
and bark at their own shadows. An active dog is fun, but is your
dog hyperactive?
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
244

Most dogs labeled as hyperactive are simply active dogs without
an outlet to burn off their energy. That means you need to ramp up
your Pom’s activity, and the exercise works best if it’s both mental
and physical. Here are some ideas:
 Throw balls for him inside the house.
 Take him for walks and runs.
 Practice some agility obstacles.
 Teach him some challenging tricks.
For more ideas, see Chapter 16.
After your Pom works off some of her energy, she needs to be
rewarded for her calm behavior. Keep these suggestions in mind
for helping her earn those rewards:
 Speak calmly and quietly.
 Ignore any pushy or overactive behavior. She must display
acceptable behaviors to earn your attention.
 Have her sit and stay if she wants you to go play again.
 Reward your active dog when she’s calm, even if that reward
is then doing something active!
You don’t want a dog that’s a lump on the rug — you just want
one that can follow your schedule.
 Show her that relaxing can be rewarding by giving her a mas-
sage as she lies down and relaxes. Soon she’ll realize that
sharing calm times with you can be just as pleasurable as the
active times.
Quieting a Barking Nuisance
A talking Pom is cute. One that barks an alarm is handy. One that
barks to alert you to the presence of oxygen in the air is a nuisance.
If you yell at your dog to make him stop barking, he thinks you’re
joining in the fun. Not a good plan! Instead, be calm and quiet your-
self. Poms that bark when they’re excited need to understand that
being quiet is more rewarding than barking. Follow these steps
with your noisy critter:
1. Wait until she’ quiet momentarily and then give her a
treat.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 245

If need be, you can throw a clattering can filled with coins on
the ground to stop her momentarily so she can be quiet
enough to begin training. his may be easier if you have her sit
and stay first (see Chapter 14 for teaching this command).
2. Keep repeating Step 1, gradually increasing how long she
must be quiet before getting a treat.
3. Add a cue word like “Shhhhh” as you start your timing.
Eventually, she figures out that the cue means she gets a
treat if she’s quiet.
4. Try Step 3 when there’s really something to bark about.
You can’t stop her from barking entirely, but you may get it under
control.
If your Pom barks when she’s alone, she may be bored or lonely.
Try one or a combination of these suggestions:
 If she’s outside, bring her in — when she’s quiet — so she can
share daily activities with the rest of the family. (Sometimes
that means you have to stand by the door and wait for her to
hush up for five seconds.)
 Give her something to do that’s more fun than barking. It’s
hard to bark when you’re busy chewing a bone or working the
food out of a treat toy.
 Make sure she has plenty of exercise. It’s hard to bark when
you’re asleep.
If your dog’s barking is so bad that you live in fear of being evicted
or of having your dog declared a nuisance, talk to your veterinar-
ian about the pros and cons of surgical debarking (which usually
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
246
Collaring that bark
Shock collars may quell the barking momentarily, but they don’t work in the long
term. Citronella collars, which automatically spray a distasteful citrus scent when
the dog barks, are more effective — perhaps because the scent lingers.
However, some dogs figure out that they can avoid the spray by barking and jump-
ing backward; others just bark until it empties and then bark with wild abandon.
Even if they do refrain from barking when the collar is on, many dogs figure out it’s
safe to bark when the collar is off.

renders the dog with a quiet, hoarse bark). This solution isn’t a
great choice for tiny dogs (surgery can be risky and not totally suc-
cessful), but it may be the only choice in some extreme cases.
Nipping Biting in the Bud
Pom owners are often lax about curbing their pride-and-joy’s aggres-
sive behaviors. But even small dogs have the ability to inflict signifi-
cant injuries. On one tragic occasion, a Pomeranian killed a human
baby that the owner had left alone with the dog. That’s definitely
the exception, but Pom teeth can still hurt. A dog that bites is dan-
gerous to others. She’s also unpopular and at risk for euthanasia.
Dog aggression encompasses many types of behavior that result in
growling, biting, or attacking. The aggression may be
 Play that just gets out of hand
 A response to pain or fear
 A fight with other dogs
 Protection of the home territory, the family, or food
 A protest against being controlled
 Without known causes
Each type must be treated differently than the others because each
type has a different cause. In Pomeranians, you’ll most likely
encounter playful aggression, fear-related aggression, and territo-
rial aggression. I cover playful aggression in Chapter 7.
Fear-related aggression
As strange as this may sound, a surprising number of dogs act like
tough guys because they’re really scared. Dogs tend to act in flight-
or-fight mode — if they feel trapped, their choices are giving up or
fighting back. Although most normal dogs remain quiet when
frightened and will submit when cornered, some dogs figure the
best defense is a good offense.
A dog who is biting out of fear demonstrates a number of telltale
signs. He tends to
 Crouch, with tail tucked and ears back
 Alternately snarl and whimper or even snap in the air
 Bite quickly and attack briefly
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 247

To minimize your Pom’s fear-related tactics in the short and long
term, try a few of your own:
 Immediately call your dog to you and have her act calm by
sitting for a reward. Removing the dog from the frightening
situation can be a reward in itself!
 Make note of the objects or events that trigger her fear and
aggression — and avoid them! Events may include your own
actions of cornering her, reaching for her, and prodding her
into facing something that scares her.
 Remember that the dog has two problems: an inappropriate
fear and an inappropriate reaction to that fear.
• Treat her fear following my suggestions in the earlier
section “Helping a Fearful Dog Be Brave.”
• When you can’t avoid a trigger, do what you can to mini-
mize her reaction by having her sit or heel.
Obviously, punishing an already frightened dog doesn’t help the
situation at all; it just makes the problem worse. But, unfortu-
nately, letting him have his way just rewards his bad behavior, and
reassuring or petting him sends the wrong message. People may
think they’re soothing the savage beast by stroking him gently as
he growls and barks, but they’re really saying, “Good boy! Get ’em!”
Territorial aggression
Having a pint-sized protector can be nice, but some Poms take
their duties a little too seriously. They challenge your guests, your
neighbors who are in their own yards, and everyone who walks
down the street. They may even extend their territory to their car-
rying bag, your person, or the car. And this aggression may be
directed toward other dogs as well.
Some parts of territorial aggression are learned. For example, if the
mail carrier comes in your yard, your dog may spot him and start
barking at the intruder. The mail carrier deposits the mail and
leaves. But your dog thinks she’s scared off the intruder. And so it
goes, day after day, until your dog is convinced she’s the toughest
dog in town.
Normal dogs may bark when a stranger approaches their territory,
but they quiet down when the owner tells them to stop. Some
dogs, however, cannot be quieted, and some owners are proud that
their dog is such a protector. But an indiscriminate protector is a
nuisance and a danger, even if she is little. Her barking is irritating,
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
248

and she can nip and trip people with her aggressive behavior. Stop
her in her tracks by doing the following:
 Eliminate the possibility for her to act in a territorial manner
by removing her
• From the fenced yard when passersby are expected
• From the front door area when you expect company
• From view of the mailbox when you expect the mail 
carrier
 Reward her for sitting and staying when strangers arrive
 Have visitors bring her treats
Owners often make territorial aggression worse by trying to reas-
sure the dog or by distracting him with a game or treat — in both
cases rewarding him for aggressive behavior. Screaming at the dog
is just as bad because the dog thinks you’re screaming with him,
not at him.
Getting Him to Drop the Begging
Begging is one of the most preventable behavior annoyances you
may face with your Pom. True, those pleading eyes are hard to
resist — and it’s not like you’ll starve if he eats some of your food!
So feeding your dog from the table is an easy habit to fall into. The
problem comes when he gets insistent or when you realize that
those hungry, sad eyes are making you feel guilty at every bite
you take.
Your dog repeats actions that bring him rewards. If you give him a
treat when he barks at you while you eat, he quickly learns to bark
or beg at the table. If you decide to stop (I mean really stop) giving
him food, he learns it does him no good, so he quits.
The problem is that most people don’t operate in this all-or-noth-
ing manner. They don’t give him food every time, but when they’ve
had enough of his begging and resolve to stop, they still give in
occasionally. This inconsistency makes begging resilient.
Think of the problem this way: When you put a coin in a soda
machine, you’re supposed to get a soda every time. If one day you
don’t get a soda, you may try again. But if it doesn’t work again,
you quit very quickly and deduce the machine is broken. That’s an
all-or-nothing situation.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 249

Now consider a slot machine. You put your coin in, and you know
that you may or may not get a reward. So you put in another coin.
And another. You keep hoping that the next time is the jackpot.
When you give in and reward your dogs occasionally for begging,
you turn yourself into a human slot machine — and your dog into a
gambling addict. When dealing with begging, be the soda machine:
all or nothing at all!
Minimizing a Dog’s Food-
Guarding Response
Dog owners get some funny ideas. One that’s sadder than it is funny,
though, is training a dog to allow her food to be taken away . . . by
repeatedly taking her food away.
The poor dog, trying to eat her meal in peace, keeps having some
jerk snatch her food away. She finally growls to let her owner know
she doesn’t like that move. The owner says, “Aha! I knew it!” and
punishes the dog. The dog, already irritated, may take the next
step and bite. So the owner decides the dog can’t be trusted and
punishes her more until the dog finally is subdued.
Although she allows the owner to continue the irritating test, one
day a visiting child reaches innocently for her bowl. The dog
lashes out at this new food-stealer; she’s labeled as vicious and
taken to the pound.
Nobody wants a food-guarding dog, but owners who repeatedly
test their dogs are essentially teasing them and creating the prob-
lem. In direct contrast, you want to convince your dog that hands
bring food to her bowl; they don’t take her bowl away. You do this
by one of several methods:
 Drop special treats into her bowl while she’s eating.
 Give her small portions, wait until the bowl is empty, and then
immediately fill it with better treats.
 Feed her meals one kibble at a time, dropping each into her
bowl as she finishes the one before.
 Never take away any food unless you replace it with some-
thing better.
Soon she’ll be begging you to come near her food bowl.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
250

If you have more than one dog, they may guard their food and
treats from each other. In this case, simply feed them separately;
only give them chewies or treats in a private room or in their
crates. Dropping a treat between them can start a fight or cause
one dog to gulp it down so fast he chokes. Never allow a treat to be
abandoned in the house somewhere. It may cause a later dispute,
perhaps when you are gone.
Discouraging Disgusting
Eating Habits
Your dog hops in your lap and kisses your face all over. Yuck! Why
does his breath smell like doo-doo? And what’s that brown gunk
between his teeth? You look closer. It really is doo-doo! After you
run to the bathroom and sterilize your face, take a calming breath
before labeling your Pom a sicko. Eating feces is not uncommon for
dogs, although it’s far more commonplace for cats and horses.
This menu choice is so common that it has an official name:
coprophagia. Nobody knows why dogs eat feces, but it doesn’t
seem to be because of a nutritional deficiency or digestive disor-
der. Eating feces may be a natural behavior for dogs, perhaps left
over from their days as village waste scavengers. Why some dogs
do it and others don’t is a mystery. Stopping it is a challenge.
The best cure and prevention is diligent feces removal. Here are a
few other suggestions:
 Add hot sauce to the feces (although she may just gobble it
down and run for the water bowl!).
 Use commercially available food additives, usually containing
monosodium glutamate, to make the feces taste bad — or at
least taste worse.
 Put a muzzle on her, which stops the eating but not the trying;
this tactic can lead to messy results.
 Ask your veterinarian whether the drugs that treat obsessive
compulsive behavior may help. Some dogs appear to exhibit a
compulsion to eat feces.
Dogs eat other nonfood objects such as fabrics and rocks. Many of
their choices can cause obstructions in the throat or digestive
system, though, and require surgical removal to save the dog’s life.
Prevention is through diligent removal of objects from the dog’s
reach, possibly supplemented by drug therapy for obsessive com-
pulsive behavior.
Chapter 15: Dealing with Doggy Delinquents 251

Lots of dogs like to eat dirt, which makes you wonder whether the
dog is sick or has a nutritional deficiency. But nobody has figured
out what they could be deficient in — unless it’s dirt!
Putting a Stop to Mounting
Embarrassment
Your guest has arrived. Your Pom enters the room, and you can’t
wait to see the impression he’ll make on your company. But when
he walks up to her, he starts humping her leg — not exactly what
you had in mind!
Mounting is a natural play behavior for dogs — male or female,
neutered or intact. They mount each other from any direction,
sometimes as a declaration of being top dog. Some dogs become
overly enthusiastic and both mount and masturbate at every
opportunity. They may use your leg, a pillow, a stuffed animal, or
other pets.
Remove the object of his affection immediately and get him to do a
more acceptable trick in exchange for a more acceptable reward.
Part IV: Training Your Pom with TLC 
252
Saying “No” to bad ways of saying “No!”
Unfortunately, many dog trainers still believe in the dominance theory, a method of
training popular in the ’80s and ’90s that models wolf-pack behavior. The basis of
this method, however, was a study that wasn’t representative of normal wolf-pack
behavior much less domestic dog behavior.
Nevertheless, trainers still talk about the method and how to be alpha (boss) with
your dog. For example, they advocate shaking a dog by the scruff of his neck as a
way of telling him “No.” In reality, wolves don’t do anything like that, and the act
can permanently injure a small dog.
In order to show him who’s boss, advocates also throw a dog to the ground and roll
him on his back until he stops struggling. But again, wolves don’t do that. This par-
ticular act is responsible for many, many dog bites. If somebody suggests these
methods to you, please just say “No!”

Chapter 16
Ten Cool Activities to Do
with Your Pom
In This Chapter
 Taking some time for just you and your Pom
 Chasing the fun with other people and dogs
T
he best times with your dog are probably when you share a
quiet moment snuggling in front of the television or make a fool
of yourself as you play a private game at home. But taking your
Pom out for other people to admire is always fun. Fortunately, you
have lots of ways to do this.
A Day at the Bark Park
Dog parks let your dog run around with other dogs, and they’re a
hit in large cities these days. Some parks are public, some are for
members only, some you pay for by the visit, some have play
equipment, and some have separate areas for big and little dogs.
Avoid parks where your dog would mingle with strange, large dogs
or run with lots of out-of-control dogs. Of course, make sure your
dog is up on his vaccinations first. Then let the games begin!
Play Fetch
Like most dogs, your Pom probably has fun playing fetch. You need
a Pom-sized ball, one small enough for her to easily hold yet large
enough that she can’t swallow or inhale it. (Err on the side of too
large.) You can also use a stuffed toy or a cat toy made from fur or
feathers.
Poms aren’t natural retrievers because retrieving had little to do
with their ancestors’ original purpose. As a result, your dog has a

better chance of enjoying the game if you teach her early. Follow
these steps to quickly train your world-champion retrieving
Pomeranian:
1. Take your dog and two of her favorite toys or balls to the
middle of a hallway.
2. Throw one toy to one end, encouraging your Pom to get
it. When she does, call her back.
3. Throw the other toy down the hall in the other direction
as soon as she gets back to you.
4. Keep this up for a few throws, but quit while she still
wants more.
Another way to teach her to retrieve is to clicker-train her. (Check
out Chapter 14 for details on this method.)
1. Throw a ball. When she takes a step toward it, click and
reward her.
2. Gradually only click and reward for getting progressively
closer to the ball, then touching the ball, then picking it
up, and finally bringing it to you.
This sounds harder to accomplish than it actually is!
Follow Your Nose!
Pomeranians may not be famous as search-and-rescue dogs, but-
they have an incredible sense of smell and are perfectly capable of
sniffing out criminals, wild animals, buried people, and hidden
treats. (I suggest you limit your practice, though, to those hidden
treats!)
1. Let your Pom see you hide a treat in an easy place (like
under a chair).
2. Take him out of sight for ten seconds or so before letting
him back in the area. Encourage him to find it, and let
him eat it when he does.
3. Hide the treat in a less obvious place, still letting him
watch you place it. Then repeat Step 2.
4. Hide the treat without letting him watch so he has to use
his nose to sniff it out. Then repeat Step 2.
5. Keep hiding the treasures better and better, and chal-
lenge him to find them.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
256

Most Poms love this game. In fact, it’s a good way to make your
Pom work for his dinner just like his wild ancestors did. If your dog
is overweight, hide his dinner kibble by kibble, helping him burn
calories as he eats!
Venture into the Great Outdoors
If you purchased a Pom thinking she was going to be the ideal com-
panion for a trip along the Appalachian Trail, plan on carrying her
a good part of the way. But if you’re up for shorter hikes, your Pom
may be, too. As a matter of fact, Poms can enjoy the thrill of a hike
just by walking in a park or even around the block.
Whether you’re walking or camping, keep her on an extendable
leash and in a harness. And if you camp in a campground, bring an
exercise pen to keep her both safe and confined.
While you’re at it, enjoy another activity in the wild — boating. The
Pomeranian’s small size makes her an ideal sailor, but make sure
she wears a doggy life vest and knows how to swim. A sturdy fish-
ing net can grab her if she falls out, but she should still know to
swim to the boat.
Become a Canine Good Citizen
Your dog, of course, is a good public citizen and a credit to dogdom.
If that’s really the case, she can earn a Canine Good Citizenship
(CGC) certificate from the American Kennel Club (AKC) through a
series of simple tests attesting to her civic responsibility.
Basically, she needs to behave around strangers (even when they
touch her) without jumping all over them or acting resentful. She
also needs to walk on a leash without jerking and freaking out,
even when people, dogs, and other distractions go by. For another
part of the test, she needs to sit and lie down as well as stay and
then come to you when she’s on a 20-foot line. Finally, she has to
let a stranger hold her leash for three minutes while you’re out of
sight — without going crazy! You can find complete details, test
dates, and test sites at www.akc.org.
You can talk to your dog throughout the test, but you can’t use
food, treats, or toys during the testing. You also can’t force your
dog into position, although you can gently guide her.
If your dog potties during the test, it’s an automatic failure, so be
sure she’s empty! If she growls, snaps, bites, or tries to attack
another person or dog, she will be dismissed from the test.
Chapter 16: Ten Cool Activities to Do with Your Pom 257

In some states the CGC title is helpful in renting apartments or
even in getting homeowner’s insurance.
Meet and Greet
If your Pom likes to make new friends, take him to a Meet and Greet,
an organized event where dogs of one or several breeds meet the
public. Such events are especially popular for rescue dogs, letting
the public see just how wonderful these dogs are. Be sure your dog
is freshly bathed and on his best behavior. Then all he has to do is
be a petting magnet and an ambassador for the breed!
Because everybody wants to pet a Pom, you need to maintain con-
trol over the situation. Keep these tips in mind:
 Have a table available to set your dog on so that he isn’t on
the ground in a sea of human feet.
 Limit the number of people petting him at one time; too many
hands can be overwhelming even for a brave dog.
 Don’t allow strangers to hold him; a person may get startled
and let go of him.
 Bring lots of tiny treats for people to give him rather than let-
ting them feed him anything of their own.
 Take advantage of this great opportunity for him to show off a
few tricks!
Contact your local Pomeranian rescue group or club, or a local
kennel club, obedience club, or shelter organization, and ask
whether they’ve planned this kind of an event. If they haven’t, ask
them to consider hosting one. Of course, if it’s your idea, you can
expect to help out!
Get Some Class!
You may be a firm believer in home schooling, but going to school
with other dogs offers your dog advantages he can’t get at home.
 He gets the important opportunity to socialize with other
dogs. This is especially vital if he’s still a puppy. If yours is an
only dog, he needs a chance to mingle with members of his
own species once in a while. Classes let him do this in a struc-
tured environment where no dog is allowed to get out of
control.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
258

 He gets to practice his good behavior around distractions.
Even sitting in a room full of other dogs is challenging com-
pared to sitting in the quiet of his own home. Obedience is
most useful in public.
 You get the chance to work under the eye of experienced
trainers who can suggest better ways to work with your dog.
 You meet people who also love being with their dogs.
Classes are available for puppy kindergarten as well as all different
levels of obedience, home behavior, agility, therapy work, canine
good citizen, rally, conformation showing, and other, more obscure
activities. Veterinary offices, grooming shops, local shelters, and
kennel clubs can be helpful in locating a class for your Pom.
Ask questions before signing your pup up for classes. Besides cost
and number of lessons, ask about the training techniques. You
want to hear words like positive reinforcement, reward based, or
clicker training. Avoid trainers that require your dog to wear a
choke collar or trainers that talk about being alpha or dominant.
Other questions to ask are
 How many dogs are in the class?
 Are small dogs segregated from large dogs?
 Are dogs under control?
 If dogs are let off the leash for some exercises, is the area
indoors or is it securely fenced?
Let Your Pom Be a Furry Therapist
Can you imagine having to give up your pets? Knowing how much
better your dog makes you feel, why not share that love with
people who can no longer have a dog? Many people would relish a
visit from a well-mannered Pomeranian, maybe just to watch his
antics or share a quiet moment. These people may be in a nursing
home, a children’s hospital, or even down the street.
Many towns have groups of people who take their dogs for these
therapeutic visits. They can train you and your dog so you’re ready
for any situation and even certify you as a team so you can visit
places dogs aren’t normally allowed. The first step in certification
is usually to pass the Canine Good Citizen test (see the previous
section). Of all the activities you can do with your dog, therapy
work is by far the most rewarding.
Chapter 16: Ten Cool Activities to Do with Your Pom 259

You can find more information on pet therapy at the Web sites of
Therapy Dogs International (www.tdi-dog.org) and the Delta
Society (www.deltasociety.org).
Pom Be Nimble, Pom Be Quick . . .
Looking for something a little more active? How about developing
your Pom’s agility through an obstacle course that he runs against
the clock? Agility competitions combine jumping, climbing, weav-
ing, running, zipping through tunnels, and loads of fun!
In an agility course, you and your dog race from one obstacle to
the next in a prescribed order. The obstacles include various types
of jumps and tunnels, a tall ramp to climb over, a raised plank to
run across, and a see-saw to maneuver. Several organizations spon-
sor trials, each with slightly different obstacles and courses. AKC
agility is divided into two types of courses: the Standard course,
which includes all the obstacle types; and the Jumpers With
Weaves course (JWW), which includes only jumps, tunnels, and
weaves, usually in a somewhat more intricate course pattern than
the standard. So get jumping!
Join a Flyball Team
Flyball is one of the few dog activities that’s actually a team sport.
It’s a relay race where each team member runs and jumps a series
of low hurdles, then steps on a platform to release a ball, and then
catches the ball and returns so the next dog on the team can start.
It’s one of dogdom’s most frenetic activities. If you thrive on excite-
ment and team play, flyball may be for you.
Before you say your Pom is too little for any team, consider this:
The height of the team’s shortest dog determines the height of the
jumps for the whole team. So each team has one height dog, the
one that guarantees the jumps are set low! Sounds like a Pom to
me! For additional information, go to www.flyballdogs.com.

he next time you’re stuck in traffic and stuck for conversation,
how about a little Pomeranian trivia? Memorize this chapter
and voila! Instant conversation!
Living in the Lap of Luxury: Royal Poms
Pomeranians have been favored by royalty around the world, but
nowhere as much as in England. Consider the following members
of royalty and their Poms:
 Pomeranians were the first royal dogs to live with Queen
Charlotte in Buckingham Palace in 1761, and Queen Charlotte
is credited with introducing Pomeranians to England.
 Queen Victoria, granddaughter of Charlotte, is credited with
popularizing Pomeranians. A great lover of dogs, she raised
and showed at least 15 different breeds during her lifetime,
focusing on Pomeranians in her later years.
 Empress Josephine, wife of Napoleon, is said to have owned
several Poms.
 In 1875, while still the Prince of Wales, King Edward took his
Pomeranian, Fozzy, to India.
 In the late 1800s, the Maharajah of Kapurthala kept
Pomeranians and Pekingese.

Famous Pomeranian People
Back in the Day
Pomeranians weren’t just popular among royalty. These beauties
have been hobnobbing with beautiful people for centuries.
 Michelangelo owned a Pomeranian that lounged on a silk
cushion while his owner painted the Sistine Chapel.
 Mozart owned a female Pom named Pimperl and dedicated
one of his works, an aria, to her.
 Chopin didn’t have a Pom of his own, but his lady friend’s
Pomeranian was so amusing that Chopin was inspired to write
his Valse des Petits Chiens (Waltz of the Little Dog).
 Isaac Newton’s favorite companion was a Pomeranian named
Diamond.
 Martin Luther (not to be confused with Martin Luther King)
often mentioned his Pom, Belferlein, in his writings.
20th-Century Celebrities and Their Poms
Something about Pomeranians seems to make celebrities want to be
seen in their presence. Some actors and singers and their Poms are
Part V: The Part of Tens 
262
 Fran Drescher: Chester
and Esther
 Hilary Duff: Macy, Bentley,
and Griffin
 David Hasselhoff: Jenny
and Killer
 Kate Hudson: Clara
 Sharon Osbourne: Minnie
 Nicole Richie: Foxxy
Cleopatra
 LeAnn Rimes: Joey and
Raven
 Britney Spears: Izzy
 Tammy Wynette: Killer
Poms on the Big Screen
Poms have graced the following movies:
 To Die For: A woman loves her dog more than her husband.
 Harlem Nights: A Pom is the constant companion of the main
character.
 Cadillac Man: A Pom named Chester steals the show.

 Enemy of the State: Will Smith’s character has a white Pom.
 Blade: Trinity: The movie has a vampire-Pom named Pac-Man.
 Superman Returns: The villainess adopts a Pom.
 Titanic: The elderly Rose has a Pom.
Poms in Paintings
Many artistic works feature Poms, among them works by Francis
Fairman (Pomeranians, which shows four black Poms), Maud Earl
(Pomeranians with Apple and Pomeranians in a Park), Wright
Parker (Roy, which shows a chocolate Pom), and Henry Crowther
(Pomeranian, which shows a red Pom). Queen Victoria’s Pom,
Marco, was painted by Reuben Cole in 1890 and by Charles Burton
Barger in 1892. Of special note are the Pomeranian portraits by
Thomas Gainsborough, which include Pomeranian Bitch and Puppy
and Perdita.
Titanic Survivors
Two Pomeranians survived the sinking of the Titanic. The first
escaped in lifeboat number 7 with her single young owner, Margaret
Hays. The other was traveling with Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild
and her husband, Martin Rothschild, the leather magnate. Martin
went down with the ship, but Elizabeth and her Pom escaped.
The Pom in The Pie and the Patty Pan
Beatrix Potter is best known for writing and illustrating the Peter
Rabbit books, but she also wrote a story about a black Pomeranian
named Duchess in The Pie and The Patty Pan in the Beatrix Potter
book series. (By the way, if you ever spot a Beswick figurine of a
little black Pom holding flowers, it’s modeled after Duchess and is
a collector’s item!)
DNA Test for Color
You can see what color your Pom is on the outside, but do you know
what colors she might produce in a litter? If you knew whether she
and her proposed mate carried certain recessive genes, you’d have
a good idea of the outcome. A DNA test now can predict nose color
as well as some coat colors by determining whether a dog carries
BB, Bb, or bb at one color location on the chromosome, and EE, Ee,
or ee at another. Consider these possibilities:
Chapter 17: Ten Fun Facts about Poms 263

 BBEE: Black with black nose; no hidden colors
 BbEE: Black with black nose; hidden brown
 bbEE: Brown with brown nose; no hidden colors
 BBEe: Black with black nose; hidden red/cream coat color

Pomeranian Paparazzi
Many Poms have made a name for themselves not because of who
owned them but also because of their own achievements.
 Dick: Dick was the first AKC registered Pom, back in 1888.
 Ch. Great Elms Prince Charming II: Weighing in at 41⁄2 pounds,
Prince won Best in Show at America’s most prestigious dog
show, Westminster, in 1988.
 Teddy Bear: When an intruder broke into the home of this 15-
pound Pom’s mistress, Teddy Bear clamped onto the bad guy’s
hand and wouldn’t let go, allowing his owner to run for help.
 Ch. Pufpride Sweet Dreams: It’s every show dog owner’s
dream to win a Best in Show. This Pom called Parker won an
amazing 42 of them — a record for the breed!
A Pom by Any Other Name . . .
In the United States, the American Kennel Club is the major
canine organization, but worldwide, the Federation Cynologique
Internationale (FCI) rules. The AKC places the Pomeranian in the
Toy group, but the FCI places Poms in the Spitz and Primitive
Types group.
This group is subdivided into several sections, with the
Pomeranian in the European Spitz section. This section includes
the Volpino Italiano, Deutscher Spitz (German Spitz), Wolfspitz
(Keeshond), Grossspitz (Giant Spitz), Mittelspitz (Medium Spitz),
Kleinspitz (Miniature Spitz), and Zwergspitz (Pomeranian). The
Pomeranian is still known as the Zwergspitz (dwarf Spitz) in its
native Germany.

Pomeranians For Dummies 
274

© PET PROFILES / ISABELLE FRANCAIS
Pomeranians are big dogs in little bodies,and they’re just as likely to feel the call of the wild.

Choosing just one Pom may seem
impossible! But don’t worry:
Whichever one you choose will end
up being the friend of a lifetime.
Pomeranians,like all dogs,enjoy stretching
their legs in the great outdoors.Just make
sure that any time you let your Pom off her
leash she’s away from traffic,big dogs,deep
holes,rushing water,or predators.
This sabled cream puppy is
an elegant addition to any
home,but don’t let that
patented innocent Pom face
fool you.As soon as he can
he’s attacking that plant!

You can’t go wrong
choosing from a litter
from a responsible
breeder — the
breeder can help 
you go beyond a 
pretty face to find
your perfect match.
PHOTO COURTESY OF BECKY COCKRUM

Pomeranians make good
companions for gentle,
responsible children.
Orange Pomeranians are
the most popular color.
Pomeranian purses,complete with mesh win-
dows for ventilation and viewing,make outings
with your Pom a pleasure.Just be sure to get
one big enough to fit the whole dog in!

Good grooming shows with clear
eyes free of discharge,clean
teeth,and a tangle-free coat.
Always keep plenty of fresh water
available.But somebody needs to tell
that Pom it’s for drinking,not playing!
Like all dogs,Pomeranians
relish the chance to explore
the great outdoors.Because
of their size,it’s safest for
them to do so on a leash.

Pomeranians are spitz dogs in
miniature,with small prick ears,
a stand-off coat,and a foxy 
expression.
Crates are great for confining 
a little Pom when you can’t watch
her — just be sure to let 
her out often!
Pomeranians are eager to do
things with their people and
will often stare,bark,and
otherwise cajole them into
putting down their work and
doing something more pro-
ductive,like playing.

Practice obedience lessons in all sorts of places.You never know when or where you’ll need 
your Pom to sit or stay.
© PET PROFILES / ISABELLE FRANCAIS
Black and tan Pomeranians,which are black with varying degrees of tan on their eyebrows,
cheeks,upper neck,lower legs,feet,and under the base of the tail,are comparatively 
uncommon but especially eye-catching.

© PHOTO COURTESY OF BECKY COCKRUM
It’s never too early to
start training your Pom
by using gentle,reward-
based methods.Even a
3-month-old puppy,like
this one,can learn to sit
and stay — but only for
short periods!
