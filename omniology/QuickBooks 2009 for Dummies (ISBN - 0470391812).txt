About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson, CPA, MBA (fi nance), MS (taxation), has a simple purpose 
in life: He wants to help you (and people like you) manage your business 
fi nances by using computers. Oh, sure, this personal mandate won’t win him 
a Nobel prize or anything, but it’s his own little contribution to the world.
Steve’s experiences mesh nicely with his special purpose. He’s a CPA in 
Redmond, Washington. He’s an adjunct professor of taxation (S corpora-
tions and limited liability companies) at Golden Gate University graduate tax 
school. And, heck, he even used to work as a senior consultant and CPA with 
Arthur Andersen & Co. (er, yeah, that Arthur Andersen — but, hey, it was 
20 years ago). Steve, whose books have sold more than 4 million copies in 
English and have been translated into 11 other languages, is also the bestsell-
ing author of Quicken 2009 For Dummies (Wiley).


Dedication
To the entrepreneurs and small-business people of the world. You folks 
create most of the new jobs.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Hey, reader, lots of folks spent lots of time working on this book to make

loupe, eating grapes, and looking for the perfect peach.
First, a huge thanks to the wonderful folks at Intuit who helped me by provid-
ing the beta software and other friendly assistance for this and past editions

Another big thank-you goes to the editorial folks at Wiley Publishing, Inc.,

unning or working in a small business is one of the coolest things a 
person can do. Really. I mean it. Sure, sometimes the environment is 
dangerous — kind of like the Old West — but it’s also an environment in 
which you have the opportunity to make tons of money. And it’s also an 
environment in which you can build a company or a job that fits you. 
In comparison, many brothers and sisters working in big-company corporate 
America are furiously trying to fit their round pegs into painfully square 
holes. Yuck.
You’re wondering, of course, what any of this has to do with this book or 
with QuickBooks. Quite a lot, actually. The whole purpose of this book is to 
make it easier for you to run or work in a small business by using 
QuickBooks.
About QuickBooks
Let me start off with a minor but useful point: QuickBooks comes in several 
different flavors, including QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks 
Premier, QuickBooks Premier: Accountants Edition, and QuickBooks 
Enterprise.
This book, however, talks about QuickBooks Premier.
Does this mean that I somehow leave you adrift if you have one of the other 
flavors? No way. I wouldn’t do that to you. QuickBooks Premier is a superset 
of QuickBooks Basic and QuickBooks Pro, and is identical in most areas to 
QuickBooks Enterprise. By describing how you use QuickBooks Premier, I 
also tell you how to use the other flavors of QuickBooks.
What’s more, for the readers of this book, there’s no discernible difference 
between QuickBooks Premier and QuickBooks Pro. You aren’t reading this 
book to prepare for the CPA exam, right? Right. The extra whistles and bells 
that make QuickBooks Premier, well, premier are all things that only accoun-
tants care about: remote access to QuickBooks and your QuickBooks data, 
reversal of general entries, extra security for general ledger closings, and so 
on. So I don’t talk much about those things.

QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies 
 
The bottom line? Yes, there are several flavors of QuickBooks, but if you’re 
just trying to get started and want to use QuickBooks, this book works for 
QuickBooks Basic, QuickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks 
Enterprise. 
About This Book
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover, like some Harry Potter 
page-turner. Instead, it’s organized into tiny, no-sweat descriptions of how 
you do the things you need to do. If you’re the sort of person who just 
doesn’t feel right not reading a book from cover to cover, you can (of course) 
go ahead and read this thing from front to back. You can start reading 
Chapter 1 and continue all the way to the end (which means through Chapter 
21 and the appendixes).
 
I don’t think this from-start-to-finish approach is bad, because I tell you a 
bunch of stuff (tips and tricks, for example) along the way. I tried to write the 
book in such a way that the experience isn’t as rough as you might think, 
and I really do think you get good value from your reading.
But you also can use this book the way you would use an encyclopedia. If you 
want to know about a subject, you can look it up in the table of contents or 
the index; then you can flip to the correct chapter or page and read as much 
as you need or enjoy. No muss, no fuss.
I should, however, mention one thing: Accounting software programs require 
you to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use them to get 
real work done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks yet, I recommend 
that you read through the first few chapters of this book to find out what you 
need to do first.
 
Hey. There’s something else I should tell you. I fiddled a bit with the Windows 
display settings. For example, I noodled around with the font settings and 
most of the colors. The benefit is that the pictures in this book are easy to 
read. And that’s good. But the cost of all this is that my pictures look a little 
bit different from what you see on your screen. And that’s not good. In the 
end, however, what the publisher found is that people are happier with 
increased readability. Anyway, I just thought I should mention it here, up 
front, in case you have any questions about it.
Oh, yeah, another thing I did was remove what QuickBooks calls its Open 
Window list from the left edge of the QuickBooks program window. I did this 
to enlarge the windows that you work with and into which you enter data. 
(You turn the Open Window list off and on by choosing View➪Open 
Window List.)

 Introduction
What You Can Safely Ignore
Sometimes I provide step-by-step descriptions of tasks. I feel very bad about 
having to do this, so to make things easier for you, I describe the tasks by 
using bold text. That way, you know exactly what you’re supposed to do. I 
also provide a more detailed explanation in the text that follows the step. 
You can skip the text that accompanies the step-by-step boldface directions 
if you already understand the process.
Here’s an example that shows what I mean:
 
1. Press Enter.
 
 Find the key that’s labeled Enter. Extend your index finger so that it 
rests ever so gently on the Enter key. In one sure, fluid motion, press the 
Enter key with your index finger. Then remove your finger from the key.
Okay, that example is extreme. I never go into that much detail, but you get 
the idea. If you know how to press Enter, you can just do that and not read 
further. If you need help — maybe with the finger part or something else — 
just read the nitty-gritty details.
 
Can you skip anything else? Let me see now. . . . You can skip the Technical 
Stuff icons, too. The information next to these icons is intended only for those 
of you who like that kind of technical stuff.
 
For that matter, I guess that you can safely ignore the stuff next to the Tip 
icons, too — even if the accumulated wisdom, gleaned from long hours slaving 
over a hot keyboard, can save you much weeping and gnashing of teeth. If 
you’re someone who enjoys trying to do something another way, go ahead 
and read the tips.
 
Sometimes, I use made-up examples (along with examples from my own 
experience) to help you understand how some topic or area of QuickBooks 
helps you and your business, and I mark these examples with the Case Study 
icon. This is just my way of continuing the giving. But sure, you can skip them.
What You Should Not Ignore 
(Unless You’re a Masochist)
 
Don’t skip the Warning icons. They’re the ones flagged with the picture 
of the 19th century bomb. They describe some things that you really 
shouldn’t do.

4
QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies 
Out of respect for you, I don’t put advice like “Don’t smoke!” next to these 
icons. I figure that you’re an adult, and you can make your own lifestyle 
decisions. So I reserve the Warning icons for more urgent and immediate 
dangers — things akin to “Don’t smoke while you’re filling your car 
with gasoline.”
 
This icon is a friendly reminder to do something. Not to be too pushy, but it’s 
probably not a good idea to ignore these babies.
Three Foolish Assumptions
I make three assumptions about you:
 
 You have a PC running Microsoft Windows. (I took pictures of the 
QuickBooks windows and dialog boxes while using Windows Vista, in 
case you’re interested.)
 
 You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
 
 You have or will buy a copy of QuickBooks, QuickBooks Pro, or 
QuickBooks Premier for each computer on which you want to run 
the program. 
 
Personally, I use QuickBooks Premier, so this book includes some features 
that are unique to the Premier version of QuickBooks. If you’re trying to 
decide which version to buy, I should tell you that QuickBooks Pro and 
QuickBooks Premier include networking capabilities (which I describe in 
Appendix C) and the ability to create estimates (which I describe in Chapter 
16). The standard version of QuickBooks doesn’t include these features.
 
This book works for QuickBooks 2009, although in a pinch, you can probably 
also use it for QuickBooks 2007 or 2008. (I have to say, however, that if you 
have QuickBooks 2008, you may instead want to return this book and trade it 
in for QuickBooks 2008 For Dummies by yours truly, published by Wiley.)
By the way, if you haven’t already installed QuickBooks and need help, jump 
to Appendix A, which tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy steps. 
And, if you’re just starting out with Microsoft Windows, peruse Chapter 1 of 
the Windows User’s Guide or one of these books on your flavor of Windows: 
Windows XP For Dummies, 2nd Edition, or Windows Vista For Dummies, all by 
Andy Rathbone (and all published by Wiley).
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six, mostly coherent parts.

5
 Introduction
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks
Part I covers some up-front tasks that you need to take care of before you can 
start using QuickBooks. I promise I don’t waste your time here. I just want to 
make sure that you get off on the right foot.
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks
The second part of this book explains how to use QuickBooks for your daily 
financial record keeping: preparing customer invoices, recording sales, and 
paying bills — that kind of stuff.
Just so you know, you’ll be amazed at how much easier QuickBooks makes 
your life. QuickBooks is a really cool program.
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Part III talks about the kinds of things that you should do at the end of the 
week, the end of the month, or the end of the year. This part explains, 
for example, how to print checks, explore QuickBooks online resources, do 
payroll, and create a business budget.
While I’m on the subject, I also want to categorically deny that Part III 
contains any secret messages that you can decipher by reading 
backward. Yllaer.
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores
Part IV talks about some of the maintenance tasks that you need (or someone 
needs) to perform to keep your accounting system shipshape: account 
reconciliations, financial report generation, job-costing mechanics, file 
management — and oh, yes, fixed asset accounting. 
Part V: The Part of Tens
Gravity isn’t just a good idea; it’s a law.
By tradition, the same is true for this part of a For Dummies book. The Part 
of Tens provides a collection of lists: ten things you should do if you own a 
business, ten things to do when you next visit Acapulco — oops, sorry — 
wrong book.

6
QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies 
Also by tradition, these ten-item lists don’t need to have exactly ten 
items. You know the concept of a baker’s dozen, right? You order a dozen 
doughnuts but get 13 for the same price. Well, For Dummies ten-item lists 
have roughly ten items. (If the Dummies Man — the bug-eyed, pale-faced guy 
suffering from triangle-shape-head syndrome who appears on the cover of 
this book and on icons throughout these pages — were running the bakery, 
a 10-doughnut order might mean that you get anywhere from 8 to 13 dough-
nuts.) Do you believe that I’m an accountant? So exacting that it’s scary.
Part VI: Appendixes
An unwritten rule says that computer books have appendixes, so I include 
three. Appendix A tells you how to install QuickBooks in ten easy steps. 
Appendix B explains small business accounting, provides a short biography 
of an Italian monk, and explains double-entry bookkeeping. Appendix C 
describes how to set up QuickBooks for use by multiple users — and for 
multiple users on a network. Yikes!
Conventions Used in This Book
To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about the 
conventions that I use in this book.
When I want you to type something, such as With a stupid grin, Martin 
watched the tall blonde strut into the bar and order grappa, it’s in bold 
letters. When I want you to type something that’s short and uncomplicated, 
such as Jennifer, it still appears in boldface type.
Except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of the letters 
you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type JENNIFER 
or follow poet e. e. cummings’ lead and type jennifer.
Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like 
“Choose Lists➪Items,” which simply means to first choose the Lists menu 
and then choose Items. The ➪ separates one part of the command from the 
next part.
You can choose menus, commands, and dialog box elements with the mouse. 
Just click the thing you want.

7
 Introduction
While I’m on the subject of conventions, let me also mention something 
about QuickBooks conventions because it turns out that there’s not really 
any good place to point this out. QuickBooks doesn’t use document windows 
the same way that other Windows programs do. Instead, it locks the active 
window into place and then displays a list of windows in its Navigator pane, 
which is another little window. To move to a listed window, you click it in the 
Navigator pane.
 
You can tell QuickBooks to use windows the way that every other program 
does, however, by choosing View➪Multiple Windows. (I did this throughout 
the book to make the figures bigger and, therefore, easier for you to 
read.) You can even remove the Navigator pane by choosing View➪Open 
Window List.

QuickBooks 2009 For Dummies 

Part I
Quickly into 
QuickBooks

In this part . . .
A
ll accounting programs — including QuickBooks — 
make you do a bunch of preliminary stuff. Sure, this 
is sort of a bummer, but getting depressed about it won’t 
make things go any faster. So if you want to quickly get up 
and go with QuickBooks, peruse the chapters in this first 
part. I promise that I get you through this stuff as quickly 
as possible.

Chapter 1
QuickBooks: The Heart 
of Your Business
In This Chapter
 Why you truly need a tool like QuickBooks
 What QuickBooks actually does
 Why QuickBooks is a popular choice
 What you need to do (in general) to get started
 How to succeed in setting up and using QuickBooks
I
 want to start our conversation by quickly covering some basic questions 
concerning QuickBooks, such as “Why even use QuickBooks?” and “Where 
and how does a guy or gal start?” — and, most importantly, “What should I 
not do?”
This little orientation shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Really. And the 
orientation should let you understand the really big picture concerning 
QuickBooks.
Why QuickBooks?
Okay, I know you know that you need an accounting system. Somebody, 
maybe your accountant or spouse, has convinced you of this. And you, the 
team player that you are, have just accepted this conventional viewpoint as 
the truth.
But just between you and me, why do you really need QuickBooks? And what 
does QuickBooks do that you really, truly need done? And heck, just to be 
truly cynical, also ask the question “Why QuickBooks?” Why not, for example, 
use some other accounting software program?

12
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
Why you need an accounting system
Start with the most basic question: Why do you even need an accounting 
system like QuickBooks? It’s a fair question, so let me supply you with the 
two-part answer.
The first reason is that federal law requires your business to maintain an 
accounting system. More specifically, Section 446 (General Rule for Methods 
of Accounting) of Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code) of the United States Code 
requires that you have the ability to compute taxable income by using some 
sort of common-sense accounting system that clearly reflects income.
If you decide just to blow off this requirement — after all, you got into busi-
ness so that you could throw off the shackles of bureaucracy — you might 
get away with your omission. But if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
examines your return and you ignored Section 446, the IRS gets to do your 
accounting the way it wants. And the IRS way means that you pay more in 
taxes and that you also pay taxes earlier than you would have otherwise.
Here’s the second reason for maintaining an accounting system. I sort of go 
out on an editorial limb, but I’m going to do it anyway. My strong belief — 
backed by over 25 years of business experience and close-hand observations 
of several hundred business clients — is that you can’t successfully manage 
your business without a decent accounting system. Success requires accu-
rately measuring profits or losses and reasonably estimating your financial 
condition.
This second reason makes sense, right? If your friend Kenneth doesn’t know 
when he’s making money, which products or services are profitable, and 
which customers are worth keeping (and which aren’t), does he really have 
a chance?
I don’t think he does.
To summarize, your business must have a decent accounting system, no 
matter how you feel about accounting and regardless of how time-consuming 
and expensive such a system is or becomes. The law requires you to have 
such an accounting system. And successful business management depends 
on such an accounting system.
What QuickBooks does
Go on to the next question that you and I should discuss: What does 
QuickBooks do to help you maintain an accounting system that measures 
profits and losses and other stuff like that?

13
 Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business
QuickBooks truly makes business accounting easy by providing windows that 
you use to record common business transactions. For example, it has a 
window (you know, a Windows window that appears on your monitor’s 
screen) that looks like a check. To record a check you write, you fill in the 
blanks of the window with bits of information such as the date, amount, and 
person or business you’re paying.
QuickBooks also has a handful of other windows that you use in a similar 
fashion. For example, QuickBooks supplies an invoice window that looks like 
an invoice you might use to bill a customer or client. You fill in the invoice 
window’s blanks by recording invoice information such as the name of the 
client or customer, invoice amount, and date by which you want to be paid.
And here’s the neat thing about these check and invoice windows: When you 
record business transactions by filling in the blanks shown on-screen, you 
collect the information that QuickBooks needs in order to prepare the 
reports that summarize your profits or losses and your financial situation.
For example, if you record two invoices (for $10,000 each) to show amounts 
that you billed your customers and then you record three checks (for $4,000 
each) to record your advertising, rent, and supplies expenses, QuickBooks 
can (with two or three mouse clicks from you) prepare a report that shows 
your profit, as shown in Table 1-1.
Table 1-1 
A Profit and Loss Report
Amount
Revenue
  Advertising
  Rent
  Supplies
$20,000
($4,000)
($4,000)
($4,000)
Total Expenses
($12,000)
Profit
$8,000
 
The parentheses, by the way, indicate negative amounts. That’s an accounting 
thing, but back to the real point of my little narrative. 
Your accounting with QuickBooks can be just as simple as I describe in 
the preceding paragraphs. In other words, if you record just a handful of 
business transactions by using the right QuickBooks windows, you can begin 
to prepare reports like the one shown in Table 1-1. Such reports can be used 
to calculate profits or (ugh) losses for last week, last month, or last year. 
Such reports can also be used to calculate profits and losses for particular 
customers and products.

14
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
I know I was kind of harsh in the first part of this chapter — bringing up that 
stuff about the IRS and business failure — but this accounting stuff is neat! 
(For the record, that’s the only exclamation point I use in this chapter.) Good 
accounting gives you a way to manage your business for profitability. And 
obviously, all sorts of good and wonderful things stem from operating your 
business profitably: a materially comfortable life for you and your employees; 
financial cushioning to get you through the tough patches; and profits that 
can be reinvested in your business, in other businesses, and in community 
charities.
Let me also mention a couple of other darn handy things that QuickBooks 
(and other accounting systems, too) do for you, the overworked business 
owner or bookkeeper:
 
 Forms: QuickBooks produces, or prints, forms such as checks or 
invoices by using the information you enter into those check windows 
and invoice windows that I mention earlier. So that’s neat. And a true 
timesaver. (See Chapter 4.)
 
 Electronic banking and billing: QuickBooks transmits and retrieves 
some financial transaction information electronically. For example, 
QuickBooks can e-mail your invoices to customers and clients. (That can 
save you both time and money.) And QuickBooks can share bank 
accounting information with most major banks, making it easy to make 
payments and transfer funds electronically. (See Chapter 13.)
What Explains QuickBooks’ Popularity?
No question about it — you need a good accounting system if you’re in 
business. But you know what? That fact doesn’t explain why QuickBooks is 
so popular or why you should use QuickBooks. (Let’s ignore for one moment 
that you probably already purchased QuickBooks.) Therefore, let me 
suggest to you three reasons why QuickBooks is an excellent choice to use 
as the foundation of your accounting system:
 
 Ease of use: QuickBooks historically has been the easiest or one of 
the easiest accounting software programs to use. Why? The whole 
“just-enter-transaction-information-into-windows-that-resemble-forms” 
thing (which I talk about earlier) makes the data entry a breeze. Most 
businesspeople already know how to fill in the blanks on these forms. 
That means that most people — that probably includes you, too — know 
almost everything they need to know in order to collect the information 
that they need to do their books with QuickBooks. Over time, other 
software programs have tended to become more QuickBooks-like in 
their ease of use. The folks at Intuit have truly figured out how to make 
and keep accounting easy.

15
 Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business
 
 I should tell you, because I’m an accountant, that the ease-of-use quality 
of QuickBooks is not all good. Part of the reason why QuickBooks is 
easy to use is because it doesn’t possess all the built-in internal control 
mechanisms that some more traditional accounting systems have. 
Those internal control mechanisms, of course, make your financial 
data more secure, but they also make the accounting software more 
complicated to use.
 
 Inexpensive: QuickBooks, especially compared with the hardcore 
accounting packages that accountants love, is pretty darn inexpensive. 
Different versions have different prices, but for a ballpark figure, you can 
get an excellent accounting software solution for a few hundred bucks. 
Not to go all grandfatherly on you or anything, but when I was a young 
CPA, inexpensive accounting software packages often cost several 
thousand dollars. And it was almost easy to spend tens of thousands 
of dollars.
 
 Ubiquity: The ubiquity issue relates to the ease of use of QuickBooks 
and the cheap price that Intuit charges for QuickBooks. But oddly 
enough, the ubiquity of QuickBooks becomes its own benefit, too. For 
example, you’ll find it very easy to find a bookkeeper who knows 
QuickBooks. And if you can’t, you can hire someone who doesn’t know 
QuickBooks and then send them to a QuickBooks class at the local 
community college (because that class will be easy to find). You’ll also 
find it very easy to find a CPA who knows QuickBooks. Now, you might 
choose to use some other, very good piece of accounting software. 
However, almost assuredly, what you’ll discover is that it’s tougher 
to find people who know the software, tougher to find classes for 
the software, tougher to find CPAs who know the software, and even 
tougher to find books on the software.
What’s Next, Dude?
At this point, presumably, you know why you need accounting software and 
why QuickBooks is probably a reasonable and maybe even an excellent 
choice. In other words, you swallowed my line about QuickBooks hook, line, 
and sinker. That decision on your part leaves the question of what you 
should do next. Let me say this: In a nutshell, before you can begin working 
with QuickBooks, you need to do the following:
 
1. Install the QuickBooks software, as I describe in Appendix A.
 
2. Run through the EasyStep Interview I describe in Chapter 2.
 
3. Load the master files, as I describe in Chapter 3.

16
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
If you’re thinking, “Whoa, cowboy, that seems like a bit more work than 
what’s involved in installing spreadsheet software or a new word processor,” 
you’re right. You might as well hear from me the ugly truth about accounting 
software: Accounting software — all of it — requires quite a bit of setup work 
in order to get things running smoothly. For example, you need to build 
a list of expense categories, or accounts, to use for tracking expenses. You 
also need to set up a list of the customers that you invoice.
Rest assured, however, that none of the setup work is overly complex; it’s 
just time consuming. Also, know from the very start that QuickBooks 
provides a tremendous amount of hand-holding in order to help you step 
through the setup process. And remember, too, that you have your new 
friend — that’s me — to help you whenever the setup process gets a 
little gnarly.
How to Succeed with QuickBooks
Before you and I wrap up the little why, what, and how discussion of this 
chapter, I ought to provide a handful of ideas about how to make your 
experience with QuickBooks a successful one.
Budget wisely, Grasshopper
Here’s my first suggestion: Please plan on spending at least a few hours to get 
the QuickBooks software installed, set up, and running. I know you don’t 
really want to do that. You have a business to run, a family to take care of, a 
dog to walk, and so on.
But here’s the reality sandwich you probably need to take a big bite of: It 
takes half an hour just to get the software installed on your computer. (This 
installation isn’t complicated, of course. You’ll mostly just sit there, sipping 
coffee or whatever.)
But after the QuickBooks software is installed, unfortunately, you still have 
the work of running through the EasyStep Interview. Again, this work isn’t 
difficult, but it does take time. For example, a very simple service business 
probably takes at least an hour. If your business owns inventory, or if you’re 
a contractor with some serious job-costing requirements, the process can 
take several hours.
Therefore, do yourself a favor: Give yourself adequate time for the job 
at hand.

17
 Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business
Don’t focus on features
Now let me share another little snidbit about getting going with QuickBooks. 
At the point that you install the QuickBooks software and started the 
program, you’ll be in shock about the number of commands, whistles, bells, 
and buttons that the QuickBooks window provides. But you know what? 
You can’t focus on the QuickBooks features.
Your job is simply to figure out how to record a handful — probably a small 
handful — of transactions with QuickBooks. Therefore, what you want to do 
is focus on the transactions that need to be recorded in order for you to keep 
your books.
Say you’re a one-person consulting business. In that case, you might need to 
figure out how to record only the following three transactions:
 
 Invoices
 
 Payments from customers (because you invoiced them)
 
 Payments to vendors (because they sent you bills)
So all you need to do is discover how to record invoices (see Chapter 4), 
record customer payments (see Chapter 5), and record checks (see Chapter 
6). You don’t need to worry about much else except maybe how to print 
reports, but that’s easy. (See Chapter 15 for the click-by-click.)
“Oh, Steve,” you’re saying, “you just intentionally picked an easy business. 
I’m a retailer with a much more complicated situation.”
Okay, well, you’re right that I picked an easy business for my first example, 
but I stand by the same advice for retailers. If you’re a retailer, you probably 
need to figure out how to record only four transactions. Here they are:
 
 Sales receipts
 
 Bills from your suppliers
 
 Payments to your vendors
 
 Employee payroll checks
In this example, then, all you need to do is find out how to record sales 
receipts — probably a separate sales receipt for each bank deposit you make 
(see Chapter 5) — how to record bills from vendors, record checks to pay 
your bills (see Chapter 6), and handle employee payroll (see Chapter 11).

18
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
I don’t want to be cranky or careless here, but one truly good trick for getting 
up to speed with QuickBooks is to focus on the transactions that you need to 
record. If you identify those transactions and then figure out how to record 
them, you’ve done the hard part. Really.
Outsource payroll
Here’s another suggestion for you: Go ahead and outsource your payroll. 
That’ll probably cost you between $1,000 and $2,000 per year. I know, that’s 
roughly the total cost of four discount tickets to Hawaii, but outsourcing 
payroll delivers three big benefits, even after considering the stiff price:
 
 Simplicity: Payroll is one of the most complicated areas in small 
business accounting and in QuickBooks. Accordingly, you will greatly 
simplify your bookkeeping by moving this headache off your desk and 
onto the desk of your accountant (he or she may love doing your 
payroll) or the payroll service. (You can use a national firm, such as 
ADP or Paychex, or a local firm.)
 
 Penalties: Did I mention that payroll is one of the most complicated 
areas in small business accounting and in QuickBooks? I did? Good, 
because you truly need to know that payroll preparation and accounting 
mistakes are easy to make. And payroll mistakes often subject you 
to seriously annoying fines and penalties from the IRS and from state 
revenue and employment agencies. I grant you that paying $1,500 per 
year for payroll processing seems like it’s way too much money, but you 
need to prevent only a couple of painful fines or penalties per year in 
order to drastically cut the costs of using an outside payroll service.
 
 Mrs. Peabody’s annual raise: One final reason for outsourcing payroll 
also exists. Let me explain. You don’t want to do payroll yourself. Really, 
you don’t. As a result, you’ll eventually assign the task to that nice 
woman who works in your office, Mrs. Peabody. Here’s what will happen 
when you do that: Late one afternoon during the week following Mrs. 
Peabody’s first payroll, she’ll ask to meet with you — to talk about why 
Mrs. Raleigh makes $15,000 more per year than she (Mrs. Peabody) 
does, and also to ask why she (Mrs. Peabody) makes only $2 per hour 
more than Wayne, the idiot who works in the warehouse. Because you’re 
a nice person, Mrs. Peabody will leave a few minutes later with a 
$1.50-per-hour raise. And at that point, you’ll remember, vaguely, my 
earlier caution about the problem of saving maybe $2,000 per year in 
payroll service fees but then having to give Mrs. Peabody an extra $3,000 
raise. Ouch.

 Chapter 1: QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business
Get professional help
A quick point: You can probably get a CPA to sit down with you for an hour 
or so and show you how to enter a handful of transactions in QuickBooks. 
In other words, for a cost that’s probably somewhere between $100 and 
$200, you can have somebody hold your hand for the first three invoices 
you create, the first two bills you record, the first four checks you write, and 
so on.
You should try to do this if you can. You’ll save yourself untold hours of 
headache by having someone who knows what she or he is doing provide an 
itty-bit of personalized training.
Use both the profit and loss statement 
and the balance sheet
And now, my final point: You truly want to use your profit and loss statement 
(which measures your profits) and your balance sheet (which lists your 
assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity) as part of managing your business. In 
other words, get used to producing a QuickBooks profit and loss statement 
each week or month or whatever. Then use that statement to determine your 
profitability. In a similar fashion, regularly produce a balance sheet to check 
your cash balances, the amounts customers or clients owe, and so on.
Maybe this advice seems obvious, but there’s a semihidden reason for my 
suggestion: If you or you and the bookkeeper are doing the accounting right, 
both the QuickBooks profit and loss statement and the balance sheet will 
show numbers that make sense. In other words, the cash balance number 
on the balance sheet — remember that a balance sheet lists your assets, 
including cash — will resemble what the bank says you hold in cash. If the 
QuickBooks balance sheet says instead that you’re holding $34 million in 
cash, well, then you’ll know something is rotten in Denmark.

I
 know that you’re eager to get started. After all, you have a business to 
run. But before you can start using QuickBooks, you need to do some 
up-front work. Specifically, you need to prepare for the QuickBooks EasyStep 
Interview, and then you need to walk through the EasyStep Interview. 
(The EasyStep Interview is just a thorough question-and-answer session 
that QuickBooks uses to set itself up for you.) In this chapter, I describe how 
you do all this stuff.
 
I assume that you know how Windows works. If you don’t, take the time to 
read Chapter 1 of your Windows User’s Guide; or try the appropriate edition 
of Windows For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (Wiley).
Getting Ready for the Big Interview
You need to complete three tasks to get ready for the EasyStep Interview:
 
 Make an important decision about your conversion date (the date you 
convert from your old accounting system to QuickBooks).
 
 Prepare a trial balance as of the conversion date.
 
 Go on a scavenger hunt to collect a bunch of stuff that you’ll need or 
find handy for the interview.

22
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
The big decision
Before you start fiddling with your computer or the QuickBooks software, 
you need to choose the date — the conversion date — on which you want to 
begin using QuickBooks for your financial record keeping.
This decision is hugely important because the conversion date that you 
choose dramatically affects both the work you have to do to get QuickBooks 
running smoothly and the initial usefulness of the financial information that 
you collect and record by using QuickBooks.
You have three basic choices:
 
 The right way: You can convert at the beginning of your accounting 
year (which is, in most cases, the same as the beginning of the calendar 
year). This way is the right way for two reasons. First, converting at 
the beginning of the year requires the least amount of work from 
you. Second, it means that you have all the current year’s financial 
information in one system.
 
 The slightly awkward way: You can convert at the beginning of an 
interim accounting period (probably the beginning of a month or 
quarter). This approach works, but it’s slightly awkward because you 
have to plug your year-to-date income and expenses numbers from the 
old system into the new system. (If you don’t know what an interim 
accounting period is, see Appendix B.)
 
 The My Way or the Highway way: You can convert at some time 
other than what I call the right way and the slightly awkward way. 
Specifically, you can choose to convert whenever you jolly well feel like 
it. You create a bunch of unnecessary work for yourself if you take this 
approach, and you pull out a bunch of your hair in the process. But you 
also have the satisfaction of knowing that through it all, you did it your 
way — without any help from me.
I recommend choosing the right way. What this choice means is that if it’s 
late in the year — say, October — you just wait until January 1 of the next 
year to convert. If it’s still early in the year, you can also retroactively con-
vert as of the beginning of the year. (If you do this, you need to go back and 
do your financial record keeping for the first part of the current year by using 
QuickBooks: entering sales, recording purchases, and so on.)
If it’s sometime in the middle of the year — say, Memorial Day or later — you 
probably want to use the slightly awkward way. (I use the slightly awkward 
way in this chapter because if you see how to convert to QuickBooks by 
using the slightly awkward way, you know how to use both the right way and 
the slightly awkward way.)

23
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
The trial balance of the century
After you decide when you want to convert, you need a trial balance.
“Yikes,” you say. “What’s a trial balance?” A trial balance simply lists all 
your assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity account balances as well as the 
year-to-date income and expense numbers on a specified date (which, not 
coincidentally, happens to be the conversion date). You need this data for 
the EasyStep Interview and for some fiddling around that you need to do 
after you complete the EasyStep Interview.
 
Creating a trial balance doesn’t have to be as hard as it sounds. If you’ve been 
using another small business accounting system, such as the simpler Quicken 
product from Intuit or the Simply Accounting program from Computer 
Associates, you may be able to have your old system produce a trial balance 
on the conversion date. In that case, you can get the balances from your old 
system. (Consider yourself lucky if this is the case.)
Just to split hairs, the trial balance should show account balances at the very 
start of the first day that you begin using QuickBooks for actual accounting. 
For example, if the conversion date is 1/1/2009, the trial balance needs to 
show the account balances at one minute past midnight on 1/1/2009. This is 
also the very same thing as showing the account balances at the end of the 
last day that you’ll be using the old accounting system — in other words, at 
exactly midnight on 12/31/2007 if you’re converting to QuickBooks on 
1/1/2009.
If your old system is rather informal (perhaps it’s a shoebox full of receipts) 
or if it tracks only cash (perhaps you’ve been using Quicken), you need to do 
a bit more work:
 
 To get your cash balance, reconcile your bank account or bank 
accounts (if you have more than one bank account) as of the 
conversion date.
 
 To get your accounts receivable balance, tally the total of all your 
unpaid customer invoices.
 
 To get your other asset account balances, find out what each asset 
originally cost. For depreciable fixed assets, you also need to provide 
any accumulated depreciation that has been claimed for that asset. 
(Accumulated depreciation is the total depreciation that you’ve already 
expensed for each asset.)
 
 By the way, check out Appendix B if you have questions about 
accounting or accounting terminology, such as depreciation.

24
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
 To get your liability account balances, you need to know how much 
you owe on each liability. If you trust your creditors — the people 
to whom you owe the money — you may also be able to get this 
information from their statements.
You don’t need to worry about the owner’s equity accounts. QuickBooks 
can calculate your owner’s equity account balances for you, based on 
the difference between your total assets and your total liabilities. This 
method is a bit sloppy, and accountants may not like it, but it’s a pretty good 
compromise. (If you do have detailed account balances for your owner’s 
equity accounts, use these figures — and know that you’re one in a million.)
If you’re using the slightly awkward way to convert to QuickBooks — in other 
words, if your conversion date is a date other than the beginning of the 
accounting year — you also need to provide year-to-date income and expense 
balances. To get your income, cost of goods sold, expenses, other income, 
and other expense account balances, you need to calculate the year-to-date 
amount of each account. If you can get this information from your old 
system, that’s super. If not, you need to get it manually. (If you suddenly have 
images of yourself sitting at your desk late at night, tapping away on a ten-
key, you’re probably right. What’s more, you probably also need to allocate 
half of another Saturday to getting up and running with QuickBooks.)
Just for fun, I created the sample trial balance shown in Table 2-1. This table 
shows you what a trial balance looks like if you convert at some time other 
than at the beginning of the accounting year.

About those debits and credits
Don’t get freaked out about those debits and 
credits. You just need to keep them straight for 
a few minutes. Here’s the scoop: For assets and 
expenses, a debit balance is the same thing as 
a positive balance. So, a cash debit balance of 
$5,000 means that you have $5,000 in your 
account, and $20,000 of cost of goods sold 
means that you incurred $20,000 of costs-of-
goods expense. For assets and expenses, a 
credit balance is the same thing as a negative 
balance. So if you have a cash balance of 
–$5,000, your account is overdrawn by $5,000. In 
the sample trial balance shown in Table 2-1, the 
accumulated depreciation shows a credit bal-
ance of $2,000, which is, in effect, a negative 
account balance.
For liabilities, owner’s equity accounts, and 
income accounts, things are flip-flopped. A 
credit balance is the same thing as a positive 
balance. So an accounts payable credit 
balance of $2,000 means that you owe your 
creditors $2,000. A bank loan credit balance 
of $10,000 means that you owe the bank $10,000. 
And a sales account credit balance of 
$60,000 means that you’ve enjoyed $60,000 
worth of sales.
I know that I keep saying this, but do remember 
that those income and expense account 
balances are year-to-date figures. They exist 
only if the conversion date is after the start of 
the financial year.

26
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
The mother of all scavenger hunts
Even after you decide when you want to convert to QuickBooks and you 
come up with a trial balance, you still need to collect a bunch of additional 
information. I list these items in laundry-list fashion. What you want to 
do is find all this stuff and then pile it up (neatly) in a big stack next to your 
computer:
 
 Last year’s federal tax return: QuickBooks asks which federal income 
tax form you use to file your tax return and also about your taxpayer 
identification number. Last year’s federal tax return is the easiest place 
to find this stuff.
 
 Copies of all your most recent state and federal payroll tax returns: 
If you prepare payroll for employees, QuickBooks wants to know about 
the federal and state payroll tax rates that you pay, as well as some 
other stuff.
 
 Copies of all the unpaid invoices that your customers (or clients or 
patients or whatever) owe you as of the conversion date: I guess this 
is probably obvious, but the total accounts receivable balance shown 
on your trial balance needs to match the total of the unpaid customer 
invoices.
 
 Copies of all unpaid bills that you owe your vendors as of the 
conversion date: Again, this is probably obvious, but the total accounts 
payable balance shown on your trial balance needs to match the total 
of the unpaid vendor bills.
 
 A detailed listing of any inventory items you’re holding for resale: 
This list should include not only inventory item descriptions and 
quantities but also the initial purchase prices and the anticipated sales 
prices. In other words, if you sell porcelain wombats and you have 1,200 
of these beauties in inventory, you need to know exactly what you paid 
for them.
 
 Copies of the prior year’s W-2 statements, W-4 statements for anybody 
you’ve hired since the beginning of the prior year, detailed informa-
tion about any payroll tax liabilities you owe as of the conversion 
date, and detailed information about the payroll tax deposits you’ve 
made since the beginning of the year: You need the information shown 
on these forms to adequately and accurately set up the QuickBooks 
payroll feature. I don’t want to scare you, but this is probably the most 
tedious part of setting up QuickBooks.
 
 If you’re retroactively converting as of the beginning of the year: 
a list of all the transactions that have occurred since the beginning 
of the year: sales, purchases, payroll transactions, and everything 
and anything else: If you do the right-way conversion retroactively, you 

27
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
need to reenter each of these transactions into the new system. You 
actually enter the information after you complete the EasyStep Interview 
that I describe later in this chapter, but you might as well get all this 
information together now, while you’re searching for the rest of the 
items for this scavenger hunt.
 
If you take the slightly awkward way, you don’t need to find the last item 
that I describe in the preceding list. You can just use the year-to-date income 
and expense numbers from the trial balance.
Doing the EasyStep Interview
After you decide when you want to convert, prepare a trial balance as of the 
conversion date, and collect the additional raw data that you need, you’re 
ready to step through the EasyStep Interview.
Before you begin the interview, you have to start QuickBooks 2009. To do so, 
click the Windows Start button and then click the menu choice that leads to 
QuickBooks. (For example, I choose Start➪QuickBooks Premier Edition 
2009.) Or double-click the QuickBooks program icon if you put one on the 
desktop during the installation.
 
QuickBooks comes in several flavors. The most common flavors are 
QuickBooks Simple Start, QuickBooks Pro, and QuickBooks Premier. These 
three programs differ in several significant ways: QuickBooks Simple Start is 
a special “light” version of QuickBooks, which looks completely different. 
(I wrote another book, QuickBooks Simple Start For Dummies [Wiley], which 
you should use instead of this book if you’re working with QuickBooks Simple 
Start.) QuickBooks Pro includes the advanced job-costing and time-estimating 
features, which I briefly describe in Chapter 16. It also includes the ability 
to share a QuickBooks file over a network, as I describe in Appendix C. 
QuickBooks Premier has features beyond the QuickBooks Pro features for 
accountants and auditors who want to use QuickBooks for rather large small 
businesses.
 
I used another very special version of QuickBooks, QuickBooks Accountants 
Edition, to write this book. The Accountants Edition of QuickBooks pretends 
to be another version of the QuickBooks software, and I told QuickBooks 
Accountants Edition to pretend to be QuickBooks Premier for writing this 
book. I mention all this not to confuse you but so that you understand why the 
figures you see here may look a wee bit different from what you see on-screen. 
Other than minor cosmetic differences, though, the various versions of 
QuickBooks all work the same way. You can use this book for any of these 
program versions.

28
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
If this is the first time you started QuickBooks, QuickBooks displays a dialog 
box that explains how it wants to use your Internet connection. (Answer: 
So that it can regularly update the QuickBooks software.) QuickBooks then 
displays a welcome message box that asks you how you want to start. For 
example, you can click a button to indicate that you want to see an overview 
tutorial, explore QuickBooks, create a new company file, or open an existing 
company data file.
What I suggest you do, however, is jump right into the fray. If you’ve never 
used QuickBooks — the likely case if you started your reading here — click 
the Create a New Company File button, which starts the EasyStep Interview. 
(If you’ve already been using an earlier version of QuickBooks, you click the 
button labeled Open an Existing Company File.)
The real fun begins at this point. The EasyStep Interview starts automatically, 
displaying the dialog box shown in Figure 2-1.
 
If you aren’t starting QuickBooks for the first time but you want to step 
through the EasyStep Interview to set up a new company anyway, choose 
File➪New Company.
To begin the interview, click the Start Interview button.
I should mention that the first EasyStep Interview dialog box identifies some 
other setup options you can use to get started. For example, the screen sug-
gests that you might want to upgrade from Quicken. (Basically, that upgrade 
just means that you want QuickBooks to try using Quicken data as a starting 
point for QuickBooks — something that doesn’t work, in my experience.) A 
simple bit of advice: Don’t try to “upgrade” the Quicken data. It’s just as easy, 
and usually considerably cleaner, to just start from scratch.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The 
EasyStep

dialog box.
 

29
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
 
The one group of new QuickBooks users who should probably try upgrading 
their Quicken data are people who’ve done a truly good job of keeping their 
books with Quicken, including complete balance sheet information. No 
offense, but you probably aren’t in this category. Sorry.
You can also, if you’re an accounting expert, just skip the EasyStep Interview. 
But you don’t need to worry about that option either. You’ll want to take the 
setup process slow and easy.
Tip 1: Get to know the interview protocol
For the most part, to complete the EasyStep Interview, all you do is fill in text 
boxes with the information that QuickBooks requests (see Figure 2-2) or 
answer questions by clicking buttons clearly marked Yes and No. When you 
finish answering a page of interview questions, click the Next button to move 
to the following page of the interview.
 
If you ever decide that you want to change some piece of information that you 
entered on a previous page of the EasyStep Interview dialog box, you can just 
click the Back button to back up. If you get partway through the interview 
process and decide that it isn’t worth the time, just click the Leave button in 
the lower-left corner, and QuickBooks closes the EasyStep Interview dialog 
box. When you next restart QuickBooks, the EasyStep Interview begins again.

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
Here are two other notes that can come in handy:
 
 The EasyStep Interview dialog box appears every time you start a new 
company (which you do by choosing File➪New Company).
 
 QuickBooks purposely makes it difficult to delete a company that you 
create in QuickBooks, so don’t make up an imaginary company to 
play with unless you’re familiar enough with your operating system to 
delete files.
At some point after QuickBooks starts, you see a message box that asks 
whether you want to register QuickBooks. If you don’t register, you can use 
the product roughly a few times, and then — whammo! — the program locks 
up, and you can no longer access your files. Either you register it or you can’t 
use it. I don’t like being forced to do something, but getting worked up about 
having to register QuickBooks is a waste of time. The simplest option is to 
just register. Here’s how: When QuickBooks displays the message box 
that asks whether you want to register, click the Online button to register 
online, or click the Phone button to register over the phone. If you go with 
the Phone option, QuickBooks displays another dialog box that gives 
you a telephone number to call and provides a space for you to enter your 
registration number.
I don’t provide you a blow-by-blow account of what happens when you take 
the interview. Instead, I provide you a handful of key tips that you can read 
now and use later (during the interview) to make the process as easy and as 
fast as possible.
Tip 2: Take your time
As you step through the interview process, the EasyStep Interview dialog 
box displays a bunch of different pages with suggestions, instructions, and 
advice. Take the time to read this information. Click the Help button if you 
have questions. If the EasyStep Interview suggests that you view a related 
document with helpful information, do so.
Tip 3: Get industry-specific advice
Industry-specific advice is one of the handiest QuickBooks features. For 
example, are you a rancher or a farmer? QuickBooks includes a detailed 
online document that describes some of the unique accounting challenges 
that your business faces, provides tips for making your record keeping 
easier, and points out QuickBooks features that might be of particular 
interest to someone like you. Are you a retailer? A manufacturer? A writer? 
A consultant? You can get this same sort of information, too.

31
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
QuickBooks displays industry-specific tips and tidbits of information 
throughout the interview. Keep your eyes peeled for the green arrows that 
mark these little hints. Let me mention one other quick pointer about this 
industry-specific information stuff: You may not understand everything that 
you read. That’s okay. You still want to read the tips and maybe jot them 
down on a piece of paper as you go along. As you work with QuickBooks 
and find out more about it, you find that more and more of the information 
provided in the industry-specific tips makes sense.
 
To view a document of industry-specific information at any time, click the 
Support link on the Navigation bar, and click the Industry-Specific Information 
hyperlink. Click the List of Industries hyperlink and then select your industry 
from the list in the Help window that QuickBooks displays. To print a copy of 
the information, click the Options button and choose Print Topic from the 
drop-down list.
 
Some hyperlinks lead to resources at the www.quickbooks.com Web site, so 
QuickBooks may prompt you to make an Internet connection to access that 
information.
Tip 4: Accept the suggested 
filename and location
A few minutes into the EasyStep Interview, QuickBooks asks you to specify a 
name and location for the file that it uses to store your accounting informa-
tion (see Figure 2-3). This is normally your company name, anyway. I can 
think of no good reason why you need to fiddle with or change the suggested 
filename or location. Don’t do it. Let QuickBooks name the QuickBooks file 
whatever it wants, and let QuickBooks store the file wherever it wants.
Tip 5: Go with the suggested 
Chart of Accounts
Immediately after you name the file that QuickBooks uses for storing your 
financial information, the EasyStep Interview displays a dialog box that 
shows a list of accounts that QuickBooks wants to use for tracking your 
business’s financial condition. This dialog box also asks whether the list 
of accounts is the one that you want to use. Unless you know quite a bit 
about accounting and are willing to find out just as much about QuickBooks, 
I recommend that you accept the suggested Chart of Accounts. You make 
your future record keeping much easier by doing so.

but I don’t 
recommend 
doing so.
 
Tip 6: Consider tracking all your 
expenses with your checkbook
You get two choices regarding how to record your expenses:
 
 By using just your checkbook
 
 By creating a bills-to-pay list
QuickBooks asks this question in the dialog box shown in Figure 2-4. I want to 
be careful about what I say next because the decision you make in this dialog 
box can truly screw up your business. Here’s my suggestion: Consider taking 
the second option — the one that says you don’t want to keep track of the 
bills you owe.
 
Now, before you rush off to the next EasyStep Interview question, confident 
and happy in my suggestion, let me tell you about the implicit trade-off that 
you’re making. If you select the no-tracking-of-bills-owed option, you do 
simplify your record keeping — which is why I suggest that you take this 
route. The predictable catch is that you can’t track your unpaid bills as 
closely. Until you sit down to write checks for your bills, you don’t really 
know (precisely) how much money you owe vendors. What’s more, you can’t 
separate the actual incurring of an expense from the cash outflow that pays 
the expense. So by taking the no-tracking-of-bills-owed option, you’re unable 
to do finely tuned accrual-basis accounting (unless you pay bills when you 
incur them). And you aren’t able to closely monitor the money that you 
owe vendors.

33
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
 
Figure 2-4: 
Simplify 
your bill 
paying by 
choosing 
not to track 
bills you 
owe.
 
In my business, I don’t track bills I owe, and that simplifies my record 
keeping. I’m probably a little unusual (at least for a small business) for a 
couple reasons. First, almost all my expenses are negotiated up front and 
then fixed by contract. For this reason, I don’t use, and don’t need to use, 
QuickBooks to keep track of and remind me about my unpaid bills. In effect, 
the negotiations and contracts do that. Second, I’ve been in business for 
quite a while — 25 years, in fact. I don’t have the cash-flow problems that 
many (most?) small businesses have, which means that if I want to produce 
an accurate profit and loss statement or an accurate balance sheet — one 
that includes all my expenses — I can just pay all my unpaid bills.
The bottom line here is this: If you don’t need to use QuickBooks to closely 
monitor your unpaid bills, and if you don’t mind losing profit-calculation 
precision because of the lag between the time you incur an expense and the 
time you pay the bill by writing a check, go ahead and skip the bill tracking. 
This choice greatly simplifies one area of your record keeping.
Tip 7: Add accounts you need
As you step through the interview questions, QuickBooks asks a few times 
whether you want to add an account (see Figure 2-5). Go ahead and do this — 
and feel comfortable doing so. Adding accounts isn’t hard. (You need an 
account for each individual asset, liability, income, or expense amount that 
you want to track.)

Telling the Rest of the Story
Throughout the preceding sections in this chapter, I describe how you 
prepare for and then step through the EasyStep Interview. When the 
EasyStep Interview is over, though, you need to take care of three other 
little jobs:
 
 You need to describe in detail your inventory, your customer receiv-
ables, and (if you chose to ignore my earlier suggestion about not 
tracking vendor bills you owe) your vendor payables.
 
 You need to describe your current business finances, including any 
year-to-date revenue and year-to-date expenses that aren’t recorded as 
part of getting your customer receivables and vendor payables entered 
into QuickBooks.
 
 If you want to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to make an 
adjustment.
These chores aren’t time consuming, but they are the three most compli-
cated tasks that you need to do to set up QuickBooks. (If you aren’t sure 
what the big deal is about accrual-basis accounting, I respectfully suggest 
that you take a break here and read Appendix B.)
To set up the inventory records, you just identify the items you hold in 
inventory, as described in Chapter 3.

35
 Chapter 2: Answering Mr. Wizard
To set up your customer receivables and (if necessary) vendor payables, you 
first need to identify the customers and vendors, as described in Chapter 3. 
After that work, you may need to enter customer invoices that were prepared 
before the conversion date but that are still uncollected at conversion, as 
described in Chapter 3. Similarly, you may need to enter vendor payables 
that were incurred before the conversion date but that are still unpaid at 
conversion.
I talk about this stuff more in Chapter 3, so if you’re still okay with doing 
some more installation and setup work, go ahead and flip over there. 
However. . . .
Determining Whether to Get 
Your Accountant’s Help
Should you get help from your accountant? Oh, shoot, I don’t know. If you 
follow my directions carefully (in both this chapter and the next) and your 
business financial affairs aren’t wildly complex, I think you can probably 
figure out all this stuff on your own.
Having said that, however, I suggest that you at least think about getting your 
accountant’s help at this juncture. Your accountant can do a much better job 
of giving you advice that may be specific to your situation. In many cases, 
your accountant can give you beginning trial balance amounts that agree 
with your tax returns. The accountant probably knows your business and can 
keep you from making a terrible mess of things, just in case you don’t follow 
my directions carefully.
Just so you know: One thing that I (as a CPA) do for my clients is help them 
set up QuickBooks. Because I do this, I can give you a couple of pieces of 
useful information about getting a CPA’s help in setting up. First, your CPA 
(assuming that he or she already knows QuickBooks) should be able to help 
you through the setup process in an hour or two, so your CPA can do it 
(or help you do it) much faster than you can on your own. Second, an hour 
or so of tutoring from your CPA should mean that you get enough help to 
record all your usual transactions. With just this bit of help, you can find out 
how to pay your bills, how to invoice customers exactly the way you want, 
and how to produce reports. I used to pooh-pooh this kind of hand-holding, 
but the older (and hopefully wiser) I get, the more I see that business owners 
and bookkeepers benefit from this up-front help. A bit of planning and expert 
advice in the beginning can save you a whole lot of trouble later on.

T
he EasyStep Interview (which I discuss at some length in Chapter 2) 
doesn’t actually get QuickBooks completely ready to use. You need to 
enter the names of all your products, employees, customers, and vendors — 
and a handful of other items — into lists. In this chapter, I describe how 
to create and work with these lists. I also describe how to clean up some 
of the accounting messiness that’s created when you enter information into 
these lists.
The Magic and Mystery of Items
The first QuickBooks list you need to set up is the Item list — the list of stuff 
you buy and sell. Before you start adding to your Item list, however, I need to 
tell you that QuickBooks isn’t very smart about its view of what you buy and 
sell. It thinks that anything you stick on a sales invoice or a purchase order is 
something you’re selling.
If you sell colorful coffee mugs, for example, you probably figure (and 
correctly so) that you need to add descriptions of each of these items to 
the Item list. However, if you add freight charges to an invoice, QuickBooks 
thinks that you’re adding another mug. And if you add sales tax to an 
invoice, well, guess what? QuickBooks again thinks that you’re adding 
another mug.

38
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
This wacky definition of items is confusing at first. But just remember one 
thing and you’ll be okay: You aren’t the one who’s stupid; QuickBooks is. No, 
I’m not saying that QuickBooks is a bad program. It’s a wonderful accounting 
program and a useful tool. What I’m saying is that QuickBooks is only a dumb 
computer program; it isn’t an artificial-intelligence program. It doesn’t pick 
up on the little subtleties of business — such as the fact that even though 
you charge customers for freight, you aren’t even in the shipping business.
Each entry on the invoice or purchase order — the mugs that you sell, the 
subtotal, the discount, the freight charges, and the sales tax — is an item. 
Yes, I know this setup is weird, but getting used to the wackiness now makes 
the discussions that follow much easier to understand.
If you want to see a sample invoice, take a peek at Figure 3-1. Just so you’re 
not confused, to make more room for the invoice window, I removed the 
QuickBooks Navigation bar that typically appears along the left edge of the 
QuickBooks window.
Do you see those first three items: rainbow mugs, yellow mugs, and blue 
mugs? You can see the sense in calling them items, right? These mugs are 
things that you sell.
But then suppose that you give frequent buyers of your merchandise a 10 
percent discount. To include this discount in your accounting, you need to 
add a Subtotal item to tally the sale and then a Discount item to calculate 
the discount. Figure 3-1 also shows this. See it? Kind of weird, eh?
Then look at the Shipping and Handling item, which charges the customer 
$50 for freight. Yep, that’s right — another item. In sum, everything that 
appears on an invoice or a purchase order is an item that you need to 
describe in your Item list.
Just above the invoice total, if you look closely, you can see another item for 
including sales tax on your invoices — and that’s an item, too.
 
I describe creating invoices in Chapter 4 and creating purchase orders in 
Chapter 7.
Adding items you might 
include on invoices
To add invoice or purchase order items to the Item list, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Lists➪Item List.
 
 QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the Item 
List window, as shown in Figure 3-2.

39
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists

A sample

40
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
2. Click the Item button at the bottom of the Item List window, and 
choose New from the drop-down list.
 
 QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-3.
 
3. Categorize the item.
 
 Select an item type from the Type drop-down list. The Item list that you 
see is dependent on the type of business you told QuickBooks you were 
in when you set up the program, so use the following list as a sample — 
the number and type of items that you need depend on the business 
you’re in. Select one of the following item types by clicking the name in 
the list:
 
• Service: Select this type if you charge for a service — such as an 
hour of labor or a repair job.
 
• Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something that 
you buy from someone else and you want to track your holdings 
of the item. If you sell thingamajigs that you purchase from the 
manufacturer Thingamajigs Amalgamated, for example, you specify 
the item type as Inventory Part. (For more information on using 
QuickBooks to track inventory, see Chapter 7.)
 
Figure 3-3: 
The 
QuickBooks 
New Item 
window.
 

41
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
• Inventory Assembly: Select this type if what you sell is something 
that you make from other Inventory items. In other words, if you 
buy raw materials or other components and then assemble these 
things to create your finished product, the finished product is an 
Inventory Assembly item.
 
• Non-Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something 
that you don’t want to track as inventory. (You usually don’t use 
this item type for products that you sell, by the way. Instead, you 
use it for items that you buy for the business and need to include 
on purchase orders.)
 
• Other Charge: Select this item type for things such as freight and 
handling charges that you include on invoices.
 
• Subtotal: This item type adds everything before you subtract any 
discount, add the sales tax, and so on.
 
• Group: Use this item type to enter a bunch of items (which are 
already on the list) at one time. This item is a nice timesaver. For 
example, if you commonly sell sets of items, you don’t have to 
specify those items individually every time you write an invoice.
 
• Discount: This item type calculates an amount to be subtracted 
from a subtotal.
 
• Payment: This option is wacky, but if your invoice sometimes 
includes an entry that reduces the invoice total — customer 
deposits at the time of sale, for example — select this item type. 
If this item type confuses you, just ignore it.
 
• Sales Tax Item: Select this item type for the sales tax that you 
include on the invoice.
 
• Sales Tax Group: This item type is similar to the Group item 
type, but you use it only for sales taxes that are collected in one 
transaction and owed to multiple agencies.
 
4. Type an item number or name.
 
 Press the Tab key or use your mouse to click the Item Name/Number 
text box below the Type drop-down list. Then type a short description of 
the item.
 
5. (Optional) Make the item a subitem.
 
 If you want to work with subitems — items that appear within other 
items — select the Subitem Of check box, and use the corresponding 
drop-down list to specify the parent item to which a subitem belongs.
 
 If you set up a parent item for coffee mugs and subitems for blue, 
yellow, and rainbow mugs, for example, you can produce reports that 
show parent items (such as mugs) and subitems (such as the differently 
colored mugs). Subitems are just an extra complexity, so if you’re new 
to this QuickBooks stuff, I suggest that you keep things simple by 
avoiding them.

42
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
6. Describe the item in more detail.
 
 Move the cursor to the Description text box and type a description. 
This description then appears on the invoice. Note that if you specified 
the item type as Inventory Part in Step 3, you see two description text 
boxes: Description on Purchase Transactions and Description on Sales 
Transactions. The purchase description appears on purchase orders, 
and the sales description appears on sales invoices.
 
7. If the item type is Service, Non-Inventory Part, or Other Charge, tell 
QuickBooks how much to charge for the item, whether the item is 
subject to sales tax, and which income account to use for tracking the 
income that you receive from selling the item.
 
• For a Service type, use the Rate text box to specify the price you 
charge for one unit of the service. If you charge by the hour, for 
example, the rate is the charge for an hour of service. If you charge 
for a job — such as a repair job or the completion of a specific 
task — the rate is the charge for the job or task.
 
• For a Non-Inventory Part type, use the Price text box to specify the 
amount you charge for the item.
 
• For an Other Charge type, use the Amount or % text box, which 
replaces the Rate text box, to specify the amount you charge for 
the item. You can type an amount, such as 20 for $20.00, or you 
can type a percentage. If you type a percentage, QuickBooks 
calculates the Other Charge Amount as the percentage multiplied 
by the preceding item shown on the invoice. (You usually put in an 
Other Charge after using a Subtotal item — something I talk about 
in the “Creating other wacky items for invoices” section, later in 
this chapter.)
 
• For all three types, use the Taxable check box to indicate whether 
the item is taxed. (Note that the Taxable check box appears only if 
you told QuickBooks in the EasyStep Interview that you charge 
customers sales tax.)
 
• For all three types, use the Account drop-down list to specify which 
income account you want to use to track the income that you 
receive from the sale of this item.
 
8. If the item type is Inventory Part, tell QuickBooks how much to charge 
for the inventory part, how much the inventory part costs, and which 
income account to use for tracking the product sales income.
 
 For an Inventory Part item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item 
window, as shown in Figure 3-4.

43
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
Figure 3-4: 
The 
QuickBooks 
New Item 
window 
with the 
Inventory 
Part item 
type 
selected.
 
 
 You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays 
to record the following information:
 
• Description on Purchase Transactions: Describe the part. This 
description appears on the documents (such as purchase orders) 
that you use when you buy items for your inventory.
 
• Cost: Specify the average cost per unit of the items that you 
currently have. This field acts as the default rate when you enter 
the item on a purchase transaction.
 
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you 
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell 
it. (QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve 
created other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate 
account.)
 
• Preferred Vendor: Specify your first choice when ordering the item 
for your business. (If the vendor isn’t on your Vendor list, 
QuickBooks asks you to add it. If you say, “Yeah, I do want to add 
it,” QuickBooks displays the Add Vendor window, which you can 
then use to describe the vendor.)

44
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
• Description on Sales Transactions: Type a description of the item 
that you want to appear on documents, such as invoices and 
so on, that your customers see. (QuickBooks suggests the same 
description that you used in the Description on Purchase 
Transactions text box as a default.)
 
• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
 
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
 
• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks 
to use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is 
probably the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use 
the Resale Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales 
and the Sales account to track retail (taxable) sales.
 
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you 
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this Inventory item’s value.
 
• Reorder Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item 
that can remain before you order more. When the inventory level 
drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the 
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to reorder the item. 
(To see the Reminders list, choose Lists➪Reminders.)
 
• On Hand: Set this field to the physical count for the item at the 
conversion date if you’re setting up an item for the first time 
as part of setting up QuickBooks. Otherwise, leave this field set 
to zero.
 
• Total Value: Leave this field at zero, too.
 
• As Of: Enter the current date.
 
9. If the item type is Inventory Assembly, tell QuickBooks which cost-of-
goods-sold and income account to use for tracking the item, how much 
to charge for the inventory assembly, and how to build the item from 
other component inventory items.
 
 Note: The Inventory Assembly item is available in QuickBooks Premier 
and Enterprise but is not in Simple Start or QuickBooks Pro.
 
 For an Inventory Assembly item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item 
window.
 
 You use the extra fields that this special version of the window displays 
to record the following information:
 
• COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Account: Specify the account that you 
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this item’s cost when you sell 
it. (QuickBooks suggests the Cost of Goods Sold account. If you’ve 
created other accounts for your COGS, select the appropriate 
account.)
 
• Description: Type a description of the item that you want to appear 
on documents that your customers see, such as invoices.

45
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
• Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
 
• Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
 
• Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks 
to use for tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is 
probably the Resale Income or Sales account. You typically use 
the Resale Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales 
and the Sales account to track retail (taxable) sales.
 
• Components Needed: Use the Bill of Materials list box to identify the 
component items and the quantities needed to make the inventory 
assembly. 
 
• Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you 
want QuickBooks to use for tracking this inventory item’s value.
 
• Build Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item 
that can remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory 
level drops to this quantity, QuickBooks adds a Reminder to the 
Reminders list, notifying you that you need to make more of 
the item.
 
• On Hand: Set this field to the physical count for the item at the 
conversion date if you’re setting up an item for the first time as 
part of setting up QuickBooks. Otherwise, leave this field set 
to zero.
 
• Total Value: If you enter a value other than zero into the On Hand 
field, set the total value amount as the cost of the items you’re 
holding. Otherwise, leave this field at zero.
 
• As Of: Enter the conversion date into the As Of text box if you’re 
describing some item as part of getting QuickBooks set up. 
Otherwise, just enter the current date.
 
10. If the item type is Sales Tax Item, tell QuickBooks what sales tax rate 
to charge and what government agency to pay.
 
 Note: The Sales Tax Item version of the New Item window looks a 
little different from the window shown earlier, in Figure 3-4. This is 
straightforward stuff, though. Enter the sales tax rate into the 
appropriate box and the state (or city or whatever tax agency name) 
into the appropriate box:
 
• Tax Name and Description: Specify further details for later 
identification.
 
• Tax Rate: Specify the sales tax rate as a percentage.
 
• Tax Agency: Name the state or local tax agency that collects all the 
loot that you remit. If the tax agency isn’t on the list, you can add it 
by selecting Add New from the drop-down list.

46
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
11. If the item type is Payment, describe the payment method and how 
you want QuickBooks to handle the payment.
 
 You use payment items to record a down payment made when the 
invoice is created to reduce the final balance due from the customer 
later. Note: Retainers and Advance Deposits are handled differently.
 
 The Payment Item version of the New Item window looks a little different 
from the window shown in Figure 3-4.
 
 Use the Payment Method drop-down list to specify the method of 
payment for a Payment item. QuickBooks provides a starting list of 
several of the usual payment methods. You can easily add more 
payment types by choosing Add New from the drop-down list. When 
you choose this entry, QuickBooks displays the New Payment Method 
dialog box. In the dialog box’s only text box, identify the payment 
method: cows, beads, shells, or some other what-have-you.
 
 When you’re finished, use the area in the lower-left corner of the New 
Item window to either group the payment with other undeposited 
funds or, if you use the drop-down list, deposit the payment to a specific 
account.
 
12. Click OK or Next when you’re finished.
 
 When you finish describing one item, click OK to add the item to 
the list and return to the Item List window. Click Next to add the item 
to the list and keep the New Item window on-screen so that you can 
add more items.
Using multiple units of measurement
If you buy and sell items of inventory with the 
same measurement units — for example, say 
that you both buy individual coffee mugs but sell 
individual coffee mugs — you use a single unit 
of measure for your purchases and sales. Some 
businesses, however, use multiple units of mea-
surement. For example, say that a business pur-
chases boxes of coffee mugs, at 24 mugs to the 
box, but then sells those coffee mugs singly. In 
this case, purchases of an item would probably 
be counted in boxes (one measurement unit). 
Yet, sales of the item would probably be counted 
as individual mugs (another measurement unit). 
To deal with this complexity, where appropri-
ate, the New Item dialog boxes include an 
Enable button (see Figure 3-3 or 3-4, for exam-
ple). Click the Enable button, and QuickBooks 
starts a little wizard that steps you through 
identifying the units of measure you need to use 
and how QuickBooks should convert from one 
unit of measure to another.

47
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
13. If you added a new Inventory item, record the purchase of the item.
 
 After you finish describing any new inventory items, you need to make 
another transaction in order to categorize the purchase of the items 
(unless they just showed up one morning on your doorstep). For an 
explanation of these transactions, turn to Chapter 7.
Creating other wacky items for invoices
In the preceding section, I don’t describe all the items that you can add. For 
example, you can create a Subtotal item to calculate the subtotal of the items 
you list on an invoice. (You usually need this subtotal when you want to 
calculate a sales tax on the invoice’s items.) You might want to create other 
wacky items for your invoices as well, such as discounts. I describe these 
special types of items in the next few sections.
Creating Subtotal items to stick subtotals on invoices
You need to add a Subtotal item if you ever want to apply a discount to a 
series of items on an invoice. (I show a Subtotal item on the invoice shown in 
Figure 3-1.) To add a Subtotal item to your Item list, choose Lists➪Item List, 
click the Item button, and select New from the drop-down list. This displays 
the New Item window — the same window I show several times earlier in this 
chapter. Specify the item type as Subtotal and then provide an item name 
(such as Subtotal).
 
When you want to subtotal items on an invoice, all you do is stick this Subtotal 
item on the invoice after the items you want to subtotal. Keep in mind, though, 
that QuickBooks doesn’t set up a subtotal feature automatically. You have to 
add a Subtotal item; otherwise, you can apply a Discount item that you create 
only to the single item that immediately precedes the discount. A Discount 
item, by the way, calculates a discount on an invoice.
Creating Group items to batch stuff you sell together
You can create an item that puts one line on an invoice that’s actually a 
combination of several other items. To add a Group item, display the New 
Item window and specify the item type as Group. QuickBooks displays the 
New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
For example, if you sell three items — blue mugs, rainbow mugs, and yellow 
mugs — but sometimes sell the items together in a set, you can create an item 
that groups the three items. Note that when you create a group, you continue 
to track the group member inventories individually and don’t track the inven-
tory of the group as a new item.

48
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
Figure 3-5: 
The 
QuickBooks 
New Item 
window 
with the 
item type 
Group 
selected.
 
In the New Item window, use the Item/Description/Qty list box to list each 
item included in the group. When you click an item line in the Item/
Description/Qty list box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at the right end 
of the Item column. You click this arrow to open a drop-down list of items. 
(If the list is longer than can be shown, you can use the scroll bar on the right 
to move up and down the list.) If you select the Print Items in Group check 
box, QuickBooks lists all the items in the group on invoices. (In the case of 
the mugs, invoices list the individual blue, rainbow, and yellow mugs instead 
of just listing the group name, such as Mug Set.)
Creating Discount items to add discounts to invoices
You can create an item that calculates a discount and sticks the discount on 
an invoice as another line item. (I show a Discount item on the invoice that 
appears in Figure 3-1.) To add a Discount item to the list, display the New 
Item window, specify the item type as Discount, and provide an item name or 
number and a description.
Use the Amount or % text box to specify how the discount is calculated. If the 
discount is a set amount (such as $50.00), type the amount. If the discount 
is calculated as a percentage, enter the percentage, including the percent 
symbol. When you enter a percentage, QuickBooks calculates the discount 
amount as the percentage multiplied by the preceding item shown on the 
invoice. (If you want to apply the discount to a group of items, you need to 
use a Subtotal item and follow it with the discount, as Figure 3-1 shows.)

49
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
Use the Account drop-down list to specify the expense account that you want 
to use to track the cost of the discounts you offer.
Click Apply Discount Before Taxes if you want to use this option. (This option 
appears only if you indicated in the EasyStep Interview that you charge 
sales tax.) 
 
You probably want to check with your local sales tax revenue agency to 
determine whether sales tax should be calculated before or after the discount.
If you need to collect sales tax, and you didn’t set up this function in the 
EasyStep Interview, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences.
 
 The Preferences dialog box appears.
 
2. Click the Sales Tax icon in the list on the left, click the Company 
Preferences tab, and then select the Yes option button in the Do You 
Charge Sales Tax area.
 
3. Add the Sales Tax item(s) to your Item list.
Creating Sales Tax Group items to batch sales taxes
Sales Tax Groups enable you to batch several sales taxes that you’re sup-
posed to charge as one tax so that they appear as a single sales tax on the 
invoice. Combining the taxes is necessary — or at least possible — when 
you’re supposed to charge, say, a 6.5 percent state sales tax, a 1.7 percent 
county sales tax, and a 0.4 percent city sales tax, but you want to show one 
all-encompassing 8.6 percent sales tax on the invoice.
To add a Sales Tax Group item, display the New Item window, and specify the 
item type as Sales Tax Group. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as 
shown in Figure 3-6. Use the Tax Item/Rate/Tax Agency/Description list box 
to list the other sales tax items that you want to include in the group. When 
you click an item line in the list box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at 
the right end of the Tax Item column. You can click this arrow to open a 
drop-down list of Sales Tax items.
Editing items
If you make a mistake, you can change any piece of item information by 
displaying the Item List window and double-clicking the item so that 
QuickBooks displays the Edit Item window, which you can use to make 
changes.

Adding Employees to Your Employee List
If you do payroll in QuickBooks, or if you track sales by employees, you need 
to describe each employee. Describing employees is pretty darn easy. Click 
the Employee Center icon at the top of the screen to display the Employee 
Center window. Then click the New Employee button that appears just above 
the list on the upper-left side of the screen to have QuickBooks display the 
New Employee window, shown in Figure 3-7.
The New Employee window is straightforward, right? You just fill in the 
fields to describe the employee.
Lesser computer-book writers would probably provide step-by-step descrip-
tions of how you move the cursor to the First Name text box and type the 
person’s first name, how you move the cursor to the next text box, type 
something there, and so on. Not me. No way. I know that you can tell just by 
looking at this window that all you do is click a text box and type the obvious 
bit of information. Right?

51
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
Figure 3-7: 
The New 
Employee 
window.
 
 
I do need to tell you a couple of important things about the New Employee 
window, however:
 
 When you release an employee, it’s important to enter the release date 
for the employee on the Employment Info tab after you’ve written that 
final paycheck. (To change to a new tab, choose the new tab from 
the cleverly named Change Tabs drop-down list.) This way, when you 
process payroll in the future, you can’t accidentally pay the former 
employee.
 
 As for the Type field, most employees probably fit the regular category. 
If you’re uncertain whether an employee fits the guidelines for corporate 
officer, statutory employee, or owner, see the Circular E publication from 
the IRS. And sleep tight.
 
The Address and Contact tab provides boxes for you to collect and store 
address information. The Additional Info tab enables you to create customiz-
able fields in case you want to keep information that isn’t covered by the 
QuickBooks default fields — favorite color and that type of thing. Again, what 
you need to do on this tab is fairly straightforward. By the way, if you’ve told 
QuickBooks that you want to do payroll, QuickBooks prompts you to enter the 
information it needs to calculate things like federal and state income taxes, 
payroll taxes, and vacation pay.

52
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
After you finish describing an employee, click OK to add the employee to the 
list and return to the Employee List window, or click Next to add the 
employee to the list and add more employees.
You can also inactivate an employee from your list if it starts to get cluttered 
with names of employees who no longer work for you. Read about inactivat-
ing items, employees, customers, and vendors in the “Inactivating list items” 
sidebar elsewhere in this chapter. I recommend waiting to inactivate them 
until after the year is finished and the W-2 forms have been printed.
Customers Are Your Business
Here’s how you add customers to your Customer list:
 
1. Choose Customers➪Customer Center.
 
 The Customer Center window appears.
 
2. Click the New Customer & Job button and then click New Customer.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Customer window, 
as shown in Figure 3-8. Use this window to describe the customer in as 
much detail as possible.
Inactivating list items
One of the neat features in QuickBooks is that it 
enables you to simplify your lists by hiding items 
that are no longer active, including those that 
you expect to be active again later. If you have 
seasonal employees, you can hide them from 
your Employee list during the times of the year 
when they don’t work. Or if you sell commemo-
rative key chains only every five years, you can 
keep them from cluttering your Item list in the 
off years. You can also inactivate customers 
and vendors from their respective lists.
To inactivate something from a list, all you have 
to do is open the list and double-click the item. 
When QuickBooks opens the item, employee, 
customer, or vendor that you want to inactivate, 
select the Item Is Inactive check box. (The name 
of the check box changes, depending on what 
you’re trying to inactivate.) Then click OK. 
QuickBooks hides this member from your list. 
The next time you display the list, the Include 
Inactive box appears.
To view and edit hidden members of your list, 
just click the Include Inactive box. Any inactive 
members show up with X icons beside them. If 
you want to reactivate a member, all you have 
to do is click the X icon, and the member is 
reactivated.

3. Type the customer’s name.
 
 Enter the name of the customer as you want it to appear in the Customer 
list. You can list customers by company name or by the representative’s 
last name.
 
4. Enter the company name.
 
5. (Optional) Enter the name of your contact, along with other pertinent 
information.
 
 Move the cursor to the Mr./Ms. text box, and type the appropriate title. 
Same with the First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. (QuickBooks 
automatically fills in the names in the Contact text box as you type them. 
Nice touch, eh?)
 
 Go ahead and fill in the Phone, FAX, Alt. Phone, and E-mail text boxes 
while you’re at it.
 
6. (Truly optional) Type the name of your alternate contact in the Alt. 
Contact text box.
 
7. Enter the billing address.
 
 You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s billing 
address. QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the 
first lines of the billing address, so you need to enter only the address. 
To move from the end of one line to the start of the next, press Enter.

8. Enter the shipping address.
 
 You can use the Ship To text box to provide the customer’s shipping 
address if this address differs from the Bill To address. (If it’s the same, 
just click the Copy button.) You enter this information in the same way 
that you enter the Bill To address. A few deft mouse clicks. Some typing. 
You’re done.
 
9. (Optional) Click the Additional Info tab and record more data.
 
 When you click this tab, QuickBooks displays the tab shown in 
Figure 3-9. You can use this tab to describe the customer in more 
detail.
 
10. (Optional) Click the Payment Info tab and record more data.
 
 You can use the boxes on the Payment Info tab (see Figure 3-10) to 
record bits of customer information, such as the account number that 
should be included with any payments.
 
11. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab to add specific job information.
 
 Because you’re creating a new customer account, not invoicing by jobs, 
I explain this step in the next section. If you’re the “can’t wait” type, feel 
free to take a look. You can add a specific job to the new customer’s 
information.

12. Save the customer information by clicking OK or Next.
 
 When you finish describing a customer, you can save it in one of two 
ways: Click OK to add the customer to the list and return to the 
Customer Center window, or click Next to add the customer to the list 
and keep the New Customer window on-screen so that you can add 
more customers.
 
If you want to change some bit of customer information, display the Customer 
Center window, double-click the customer you want to change, and then make 
changes in the Edit Customer window.
It’s Just a Job
In QuickBooks, you can track invoices by customer or by customer and job. 
This may sound kooky, but some businesses invoice customers (perhaps 
several times) for specific jobs.

56
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
Take the case of a construction subcontractor who does foundation work for a 
handful of builders of single-family homes. This construction subcontractor 
probably invoices his customers by job, and he invoices each customer 
several times for the same job. For example, he invoices Poverty Rock Realty 
for the foundation job at 1113 Birch Street when he pours the footing and then 
again when he lays the block. At 1028 Fairview, the same foundation job takes 
more than one invoice, too.
To set up jobs for customers, you first need to describe the customers (as I 
explain in the preceding section). Then follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Customers➪Customer Center.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window.
 
2. Right-click the customer for whom you want to set up a job, and 
choose Add Job from the contextual menu that appears.
 
 QuickBooks displays the New Job window (shown in Figure 3-11). You 
use this window to describe the job. A great deal of the information in 
this window appears on the invoice.
 
3. Add the job name.
 
 The cursor is in the Job Name text box. Just type the name of the job 
or project.
 
Figure 3-11: 
The New 
Job 
window.
 

57
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
4. Identify the customer.
 
 On the off chance that you selected the wrong customer in Step 2, 
take a peek at the Customer drop-down list. Does it name the 
correct customer? If not, activate the drop-down list, and select 
the correct customer.
 
5. (Optional) Name your contact and fill in other relevant information.
 
 You can enter the name of your contact and alternative contact in 
the Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. QuickBooks 
fills in the Contact text box for you. You probably don’t need to be 
told this, but fill in the Phone and FAX text boxes just so that you have 
that information on hand. If you want to get truly optional, fill in the 
Alt. Phone and Alt. Contact text boxes. Go ahead: Take a walk on the 
wild side.
 
6. Enter the job’s billing address.
 
 You can use the Bill To text box to provide the customer’s job billing 
address. Because chances are good that the job billing address is the 
same as the customer billing address, QuickBooks copies the billing 
address from the Customer list. But if need be, make changes.
 
7. Enter the Ship To address.
 
 You can use the Ship To text box to provide the job’s shipping address. 
Click the Copy button if the shipping address is the same as the Bill To 
address.
The little things do matter
If you aren’t familiar with how payment terms 
work, you can get a bird’s-eye view here. For 
the most part, payment terms just tell the cus-
tomer how quickly you expect to be paid. For 
example, Due on Receipt means that you expect 
to be paid as soon as possible. If Net is followed 
by some number, as in Net 15 or Net 30, the 
number indicates the number of days after 
the invoice date within which the customer is 
supposed to pay. So Net 15 means that the 
customer is supposed to pay within 15 days of 
the invoice date.
Some payment terms, such as 2% 10 Net 30, 
include early payment discounts. In other 
words, the customer can deduct 2 percent from 
the bill if it’s paid within 10 days. Either way, the 
customer must pay the bill within 30 days. For 
more information on how to make early pay-
ment discounts work for you, see Chapter 21.

58
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
8. (Massively optional) Click the Additional Info tab and categorize 
the job.
 
 You can use the Customer Type drop-down list to give the job type. 
The only initial types in the default list are Corporate and Referral. You 
can create other types by choosing Add New from the Customer Type 
drop-down list (so that QuickBooks displays the New Customer Type 
dialog box) and then filling in the dialog-box blanks.
 
9. Click the Payment Info tab and set the customer’s credit limit (that is, 
if you’ve given the customer a credit limit).
 
 You can set the customer’s credit limit by using the Credit Limit box.
 
10. Specify the total of the customer’s unpaid invoices by using the 
Opening Balance text box.
 
 Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box and type the total 
amount owed by the customer on the conversion date.
 
 QuickBooks suggests that you not enter a balance in the Opening 
Balance box as part of setting up QuickBooks. (If you’re interested in 
the logic of QuickBook’s argument, you can view the Customers online 
tutorial, which is available by choosing Help➪Learning Center Tutorials 
and then clicking the How to Enter Your Customers link.) However, 
I’ve thought long and hard about this, and I think you want to enter the 
customer’s unpaid balance into the Opening Balance box. Doing this 
makes setting up QuickBooks correctly much easier. 
 
11. Enter the current date in the As Of text box.
 
12. (Optional) Click the Job Info tab and add specific job information.
 
 Figure 3-12 shows the Job Info tab. You can use the Job Status drop-
down list to choose None, Pending, Awarded, In Progress, Closed, or Not 
Awarded, whichever is most appropriate. The Start Date is (I know that 
this one is hard to believe) the day you start the job. As anyone knows, 
the Projected End and the End Date aren’t necessarily the same. Don’t 
fill in the End Date until the job is actually finished. The Job Description 
field can contain any helpful information you can fit on one line, and the 
Job Type is an extra field you can use. (If you do use this field, you can 
add a new job type by choosing Add New from the Job Type list.)
 
13. Save the job information by clicking OK or Next.
 
 After you finish describing the job, you have two options: You can click 
OK to add the job to the list and return to the Customer Center window, 
or you can click Next to add the job to the list and keep the New Job 
window on-screen so that you can add more jobs.

59

You can edit job information the same way that you edit customer 
information. Display the Customer Center window by choosing Customer➪
Customer Center. When QuickBooks displays the window, double-click the 
job, and make the changes in the Edit Job window that appears.
Adding Vendors to Your Vendor List
Adding vendors to your Vendor list works the same basic way as adding cus-
tomers to your Customer list. Here’s how to get the job done:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Vendor Center or click the Vendor Center icon at 
the top of the screen.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Vendor Center window. Along with listing your 
vendors, it lists any sales tax agencies that you identified as part of 
setting up Sales Tax items.
 
2. Click the New Vendor button.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Vendor window, as 
shown in Figure 3-13. You use this window to describe the vendors and 
all their little idiosyncrasies.

60
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
3. Enter the vendor’s name.
 
 The cursor is already in the Vendor Name text box. All you have to do is 
type the vendor’s name as you want it to appear on the Vendor list. If 
you want to list your vendors by company name, enter the company 
name. To list them by the first or last name of the sales representative, 
enter one of these names. Just remember that the list is going to sort, 
alphabetically or numerically, by the information you enter in this field, 
not by the information below.
 
4. (Optional) Enter the name of your contact.
 
 Fill in the Mr./Ms., First Name, M.I., and Last Name text boxes. 
QuickBooks fills in the Contact text box for you automatically.
 
5. Enter the address to which you’re supposed to mail checks.
 
 You can use the Address text box to provide the vendor’s address. 
QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first line of 
the address, so you need to enter only the street address, city, state, 
and ZIP code. To move from the end of one line to the start of the next, 
press Enter.
 
6. (Optional) Enter the vendor’s telephone and fax numbers, and, if 
available, the e-mail address.
 
 The window also has an Alt. Phone text box for a second telephone 
number. They thought of everything, didn’t they?

Info tab of

 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
7. Verify the entry in the Print on Check As text box.
 
 QuickBooks assumes that you want the company name to appear on any 
checks you write for this vendor. If not, change the text box to whatever 
you feel is more appropriate.
 
8. At this point, click the Additional Info tab.
 
 The window you see on-screen hopefully bears an uncanny resemblance 
to Figure 3-14.
 
9. (Optional) Enter your account number in the Account No. text box.
 
 If the vendor has assigned account numbers or customer numbers to 
keep track of customers, type your account or customer number in 
the Account No. text box. You can probably get this piece of information 
from the vendor’s last invoice.
 
 An account number is required if you want to use QuickBooks’ online 
bill payment feature (which I describe in Chapter 13) to pay the vendor. 
QuickBooks transfers the account number to the memo field of the 
payment check.
 
Figure 3-14:

Additional 
Info tab of

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
10. Categorize the vendor by selecting an option from the Type 
drop-down list.
 
 See that Type drop-down list? If you open the list, you see the initial 
QuickBooks list of vendor types. You can pick any of these types, but 
my suggestion is that you diligently identify any vendor to whom you 
need to send a 1099 Form as a 1099 contractor. (A 1099 contractor is 
any unincorporated business or person who performs services and to 
whom you pay $600 or more during the year.)
 
 To create a new vendor type, select Add New from the drop-down 
list and fill in the blanks in the New Vendor Type dialog box that 
QuickBooks displays. You can create as many new vendor types as 
you need.
 
11. Specify the payment terms that you’re supposed to observe by 
selecting a term from the Terms drop-down list.
 
 QuickBooks has already set up all the usual ones. (If you want to, you 
can choose Add New to set up additional payment terms.)
 
 If a vendor offers an early payment discount, it’s usually too good 
a deal to pass up. Interested in more information about early payment 
discounts? Is yours an inquiring mind that needs to know? See Chapter 
21 to find out about the advantages of early payment discounts.
 
12. (Optional) Specify your credit limit, if the vendor has set one.
 
 This procedure is obvious, right? You click in the Credit Limit text box 
and enter the number.
 
13. (If applicable) Store the vendor’s federal tax identification number 
and select the Vendor Eligible for 1099 check box.
 
 This number might be the vendor’s Social Security number if the vendor 
is a one-person business. If the vendor has employees, the federal tax 
identification number is the vendor’s employer identification number. 
You need this information only if you’re required to prepare a 1099 for 
the vendor.
 
14. Type 0 (zero) in the Opening Balance text box.
 
 You typically don’t want to enter the amount you owe the vendor; 
you do that later, when you pay your bills. However, if you’re using 
accrual basis accounting for your expenses (this just means that your 
accounting system counts bills as expenses when you get the bill and 
not when you pay the bill), you need to tell QuickBooks what amounts 
you owe vendors at the conversion date. You can do that most easily 
by entering opening balances for vendors into the Opening Balance 
box as you set up a vendor in the Vendor list.
 
15. Enter the conversion date in the As Of text box.
 
 What you’re doing here, by the way, is providing the date on which the 
value shown in the Opening Balance text box is correct.

63
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
 QuickBooks 2009 provides an Account Prefill tab in the New Vendor 
window. Use this tab to specify a set of expense accounts that 
QuickBooks will suggest anytime you indicate you’re writing a check, 
entering a bill, or entering a credit card charge for the vendor.
 
16. Save the vendor information by clicking OK or Next.
 
 After you finish describing the vendor, you have two options: Click OK 
to add the vendor to the list and return to the Vendor Center window, or 
click Next to add the vendor to the list and leave the New Vendor 
window on-screen so that you can add more vendors.
The Other Lists
Throughout the preceding sections, I cover almost all the most important 
lists. A few others I haven’t talked about yet are Fixed Asset, Price Level, 
Sales Tax Code, Classes, Other Names, Sales Rep, Customer Type, Vendor 
Type, Job Type, Terms, Customer Messages, Payment Method, Ship Via, and 
Memorized Transactions. I don’t give blow-by-blow descriptions of how you 
use these lists because you don’t need them. The other QuickBooks lists are 
generally more than adequate. You can usually use the standard lists as is, 
without building other lists.
Just so I don’t leave you stranded, however, I want to give you quick-and-
dirty descriptions of these other lists and what they do.
 
To see some of these lists, choose the list from the Lists menu, or choose 
Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists and choose the list from the submenu 
that QuickBooks displays.
The Fixed Asset list
If you buy fixed assets — things such as vehicles, various pieces of furniture, 
miscellaneous hunks of equipment, and so on — somebody is supposed to be 
tracking this stuff in a list. Why? You need to have this information at your 
fingertips (or at your accountant’s fingertips) to calculate depreciation. And 
if you later dispose of some item, you need this information to calculate the 
gain or loss on the sale of the item.
For these reasons, QuickBooks includes a Fixed Asset list. Figure 3-15 
shows the Fixed Asset Item List window, used to describe and identify your 
fixed assets.

64
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
Figure 3-15: 
The Fixed 
Asset Item 
List window.
 
Note: I should tell you that your CPA or tax accountant already has been 
maintaining this type of list for you. So don’t, like, totally freak out because 
this is the first you’ve heard about this fixed assets business.
 
Chapter 18 describes handling fixed assets in a bit more detail.
The Price Level list
The first time I encountered the QuickBooks Price Level feature, I was sorely 
confused about how the feature worked. I’m still a little confused — not 
about how the feature works, but about who’d even want to use this feature. 
But heck, what do I know? Here’s the deal: Price Levels enable you to adjust 
an item price as you’re creating an invoice. For example, you can create a 
price level that increases the price for some item by 20 percent. And you 
create a price level that decreases the price for some item by ten percent. 
You adjust a price by selecting a price level from the Price field on an invoice. 
(This may not make much sense until you see the Create Invoices window, 
which I describe in Chapter 4, but it’s fairly straightforward.)

65
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
The Sales Tax Code list
The Sales Tax Code list just maintains a list of sales tax codes. These sales 
tax codes, when used on an invoice or bill, tell QuickBooks whether items 
are taxable.
The Class list
Classes enable you to classify transactions by department or location, for 
example, so that you can track trends and assess performance across 
parts of your business. Classes are cool (really cool), but they add another 
dimension to the accounting model that you use in QuickBooks, so I don’t 
describe them here. I urge you — nay, I implore you — to get comfortable 
with how the rest of QuickBooks works before you begin mucking about 
with classes. Here are just a handful of useful tidbits in case you want 
to use classes:
 
 You may need to turn on the QuickBooks Class Tracking feature. To do 
this, choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon, click the 
Company Preferences tab, and select the Use Class Tracking check box.
 
 Note: The Class box appears in data entry windows only after you turn 
on class tracking.
 
 To display the Class list, choose Lists➪Class List.
 
 To add classes to the Class list, display the Class List window (choose 
Lists➪Class List), right-click the window, choose New to display the New 
Class window, and then fill in the blanks.
 
 To tag transactions as falling into a particular class — invoices, checks, 
bills, journal entries, and so on — select the appropriate class from the 
Class list box.
By the way, one other point: Before you go off and start using classes to 
complicate your accounting, make sure that you can’t get what you want by 
beefing up your chart of accounts.
 
You won’t see a Class List command in the Lists menu if you indicated during 
the EasyStep Interview that you don’t want to use classes. But you can change 
your mind later and start using classes. Choose the Edit➪Preferences com-
mand, click the Accounting icon, and mark the Use Class Tracking box on the 
Company Preferences tab.

Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
The Other Names list
QuickBooks provides an Other Names list that works as a watered-down, 
wimpy Vendor and Employee list combination. You can write checks to 
people named on this Other Names list, but you can’t do anything else. You 
can’t create invoices or purchase orders for them, for example. And you 
don’t get any of the other information that you want to collect for vendors or 
employees.
 
You’re better off working with good, accurate, rich Vendor and Employee lists. 
If you don’t like this suggestion, however, just choose Lists➪Other Names List 
to display the Other Names List window, click the Other Names button, 
choose New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the blanks in the New 
Name window.
The Sales Rep list
You can create a list of the sales representatives you work with and then 
indicate which sales rep sells to a customer or generates a sale. To do this, 
choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Sales Rep. When you choose 
this command, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep List window, which lists all 
the sales representatives. To add sales representatives, click the Sales Rep 
button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that 
QuickBooks displays.
The Customer, Vendor, and Job Types list
You can create lists of customer types, vendor types, and job types and 
then use these lists to categorize customer, vendor, and job information. 
This is probably no surprise, but to do this, you need to use the appropriate 
command:
 
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Customer Type List
 
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Vendor Type List
 
 Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Job Type List
When you choose one of these commands, QuickBooks displays the 
appropriate List window, which lists all the Customer types, Vendor types, 
or Job types. To add types, click the Type button, select New from the drop-
down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
How you use any of these types of lists depends on your business. In a 
situation in which you want to sort or segregate customers, vendors, or jobs 
in some unusual way, use the Customer Type, Vendor Type, or Job Type list.

67
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
Over the last few years, I’ve used the Customer Type box to identify which 
marketing technique has brought me a client: yellow pages advertising, 
newspaper advertising, professional referrals, and so on. Because QuickBooks 
easily prints reports that summarize client revenue by customer type, using 
the Customer Type field in this manner lets me easily see how much revenue 
different marketing activities produce — and when I’m getting a decent return 
on my marketing dollars.
The Terms list
QuickBooks maintains a Terms list, which you use to specify what payment 
terms are available. To add terms, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists➪Terms List. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays 
the Terms List window. To add more terms, click the Terms button, select 
New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks 
displays.
The Customer Message list
This list is another minor player in the QuickBooks drama. You can stick 
messages at the bottom of invoices if you first type the message in the 
Customer Message list. QuickBooks provides a handful of boilerplate mes-
sages: thank you, happy holidays, mean people suck, and so on. You can add 
more messages by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪
Customer Message List. When QuickBooks displays the Customer Message 
List window, click its Customer Message button and choose New. Then use 
the New Customer Message window that QuickBooks displays to create a 
new message.
The Payment Method list
This will be a big surprise. (I’m just kidding.) QuickBooks provides descrip-
tions for the usual payment methods. But, of course, you can add to these by 
choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Payment Method. When 
you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the lost city of Atlantis. 
Okay, not really. QuickBooks actually displays the Payment Method window. 
To add more methods, click the Payment Method button, select New from 
the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Ship Via list
QuickBooks provides descriptions for the usual shipping methods. 
These descriptions are probably entirely adequate. If you need to add more, 

68
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
however, you can do so by choosing Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists➪Ship Via. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the 
Ship Via List window, which lists all the shipping methods that you or 
QuickBooks said are available. To add more methods, click the Shipping 
Method button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the 
window that QuickBooks displays. Friends, it doesn’t get much easier 
than this.
The Vehicle list
As I describe in a bit more detail in Chapter 18, QuickBooks provides a 
Vehicle list that you can use to maintain a list of business vehicles. To see 
the Vehicle list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile Lists➪Vehicle List. 
When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List 
window, which lists all the vehicles that you previously said are available. To 
identify additional vehicles, click the Vehicle button, select New from the 
drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
To record vehicle mileage inside QuickBooks, choose Company➪Enter 
Vehicle Mileage. Then use the window that QuickBooks displays to 
identify the vehicle, the trip length in miles, the trip date, and a bit of other 
trip-related information.
The Memorized Transaction list
The Memorized Transaction list isn’t really a list. At least, it’s not like the 
other lists that I describe in this chapter. The Memorized Transaction 
list is a list of accounting transactions — invoices, bills, checks, purchase 
orders, and so on — that you’ve asked QuickBooks to memorize. To display 
the Memorized Transaction list, choose Lists➪Memorized Transaction List.
You can have QuickBooks memorize transactions so that you can quickly 
record them later or even put them on a schedule for recurring usage. 
This feature can save you lots of time, especially for transactions you 
regularly make.
The Reminders list
Here’s a list that isn’t accessible from the Lists menu. QuickBooks keeps 
track of a bunch of stuff that it knows you need to monitor. If you choose 

69
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
Company➪Reminders, QuickBooks displays the Reminders window. Here, 
you see such entries such as invoices and checks that need to be printed, 
inventory items you should probably reorder, and so on.
Organizing and Printing Lists
To organize a list, you must be in single-user mode. (I describe multi-user 
mode in Appendix C.) Here are some ways that you can organize your list:
 
 To move an item and all its subitems, click the diamond beside the item 
and then drag the item up or down the list to a new location.
 
 To make a subitem its own item, click the diamond beside the item and 
then drag it to the left.
 
 To make an item a subitem, first move the item so that it’s directly 
beneath the item you want it to fall under. Then click the diamond 
beside the item and drag it to the right.
 
 To alphabetize a list, click the Name button at the top of the list.
 
 To re-sort a list (so it shows its original order), click the button in the 
lower-left corner of the list window. (The name of this button changes, 
depending on the list that you’re displaying.) Then choose Re-Sort List 
from the pop-up menu. 
Printing lists
You can print customer, vendor, and employee lists by clicking the Print 
button at the top of the specific Center screen for the type of list you choose. 
The list will be among the options available to print in a drop-down list.
You can print a regular list by displaying the list, clicking the button in the 
lower-left corner of the list window, and then choosing Print List. However, 
often the best way to print a list is to print a list report. You can create, 
customize, and print a list report by choosing Reports➪List and then

of list reports by clicking the Reports button in the list window and choosing 
a report from the pop-up menu. For more information on printing reports, see 
Chapter 15.
 
Click the Activities button in a list window to quickly access common

Exporting List Items to 
Your Word Processor
If you use QuickBooks to store the names and addresses of your customers, 
vendors, and employees, you can create a text file of the contact information 
for these people. You can then export this file to another application, like a 
word processor, to create reports that use this information.
To export list information to a text file, click the button in the lower-left 
corner of the list window, and choose Print List. When QuickBooks displays 
the Print dialog box, select the File option button, click Print, and then 
provide a filename when prompted.
 
The File menu Print Forms command also provides a Labels command for pro-
ducing mailing labels for customers and vendors. And before I forget, let me 
also mention that the last command of the Company menu — Prepare Letters 
With Envelopes — lets you prepare letters (and, duh, addressed envelopes) 
from the name and address information from the Customer, Vendor, and 
Employee lists discussed earlier in this chapter.)
Dealing with the Chart of Accounts List
I saved the best for last. After you set up your lists, you still need to finalize 
one list: the Chart of Accounts. The Chart of Accounts just lists the accounts 
you and QuickBooks use to track income and expenses, assets, liabilities, 
and equity.
This step is kind of a funny one, however, because a bunch of Chart of 
Accounts stuff is already set up. So what you’re really doing here is just 
finalizing the chart of accounts. Typically, this consists of two or possibly 
three separate steps: describe customer balances, describe vendor 
balances, and enter the rest of the trial balance.
Describing customer balances
If you entered customer unpaid invoice totals when you set up the 
customers — which is what I recommend — you’ve already described 
your customer balances. You, my friend, can skip ahead to the section 
“Describing vendor balances.”
If you didn’t enter customer unpaid invoice totals, you need to supply that 
information before you finalize the Chart of Account information. To do 
this, you enter the invoice in the usual way, which I describe in Chapter 4. 

71
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
The one truly important thing to do is use the original invoice date when 
you enter the invoice.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Hey, dude. The order of your instructions 
is all screwed up. Here I am, slogging through Chapter 3, and now totally 
out of the blue, you’re telling me that I have to jump ahead to Chapter 4 and 
read that?”
Yeah, well, that’s right. This jumping around and jumping ahead is the big 
reason that I told you earlier to do it the way I did. Hey, sorry.
Describing vendor balances
If you entered vendor unpaid bill totals when you set up the vendors — this 
is also what I recommend — you described your vendor balances.
If you didn’t enter vendor unpaid bill totals, you need to supply that informa-
tion, as I describe in Chapter 6 in the discussion on recording your bills the 
accounts payable way. The one truly important thing to do is use the original 
vendor bill date when you enter the vendor bill.
Camouflaging some accounting goofiness
After you enter the customer and vendor balances into QuickBooks, you 
need to enter the rest of the trial balance, which you do by taking two big 
steps. In the first step, you camouflage a couple of goofy accounts, called sus-
pense accounts, that QuickBooks creates when you set up the Item, Customer, 
and Vendor lists. The second step, which I describe in the following section, 
is to supply the last few missing numbers.
Figure 3-16 shows a sample trial balance after I enter the inventory, accounts 
receivable, and accounts payable balances. (These account balances get set 
up indirectly, as I note in the sidebar “For accountants only,” later in this 
chapter.) When you set up your Item, Customer, and Vendor lists, you also 
create account balances for inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts 
payable.
You can produce your own half-complete trial balance from inside 
QuickBooks by clicking the Report Center icon and choosing Reports➪
Accountants & Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance 
report in a document window.

Figure 3-16: 
A sample 
trial 
balance.
 
If you need to do so, enter the conversion date in the As Of box by clicking in 
the box and typing the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Figure 3-16, 
for example, shows the conversion date 7/31/2009 in a box. You can set the 
From box to any value; the From and To range just needs to end with the 
conversion date. Make a note of the credit and debit balances shown for the 
Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses accounts.
If you want, you can print the report by clicking the Print button; then, when 
QuickBooks displays the Print Report dialog box, click its Print button. Yes, 
you click two Print buttons.
After you have the conversion date balances for the Uncategorized 
Income and Uncategorized Expenses accounts, you’re ready to make the 
accrual-accounting adjustment. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, either click the Chart of Accounts icon in the 
Company area or choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts to display the Chart 
of Accounts window, as shown in Figure 3-17.
 
2. Double-click Opening Balance Equity in the Chart of Accounts list to 
display that account.
 
 Opening Bal Equity is listed after the liability accounts. QuickBooks 
displays the register — just a list of transactions — for the account 
named Opening Bal Equity. Figure 3-18 (at the end of this step list), 
coincidentally, shows this register.

3. Select the next empty row of the register if it isn’t already selected 
(although it probably is).
 
 You can select a row by clicking it, or you can use the up- or down-arrow 
key to move to the next empty row.
 
4. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
 
 Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the 
date. Use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, you can type either 
7312009 or 7/31/2009 to enter July 31, 2009.
 
5. Type the Uncategorized Income account balance (from the trial 
balance report) in the Increase field.
 
 In Figure 3-16, for example, the Uncategorized Income account balance 
is $190,000. In this case, click the Increase field, and type 190000 in 
the field.
 
 You don’t need to include the dollar sign or the comma; QuickBooks 
adds the punctuation for you.

74
Part I: Quickly into QuickBooks 
 
6. Type Uncategorized Income (the account name) in the Account field.
 
 Select the Account field, which is on the row under the word Payee, and 
begin typing Uncategorized Income, the account name. As soon as you 
type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure out what you’re 
typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you. When this happens, you 
can stop typing.
 
7. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Income 
adjustment transaction.
 
8. Again, select the next empty row of the register.
 
 Click the row or use the up- or down-arrow key.
 
9. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
 
 Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the 
date. You use the MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type 7/31/2009, for 
example, to enter July 31, 2009.
 
10. Type the Uncategorized Expenses account balance in the Decrease 
field.
 
 In Figure 3-16, for example, the Uncategorized Expenses account balance 
is $75,000. In this case, you click the Decrease field and then type 75000. 
I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again because you’re just starting 
out: You don’t need to include any punctuation, such as a dollar sign 
or comma.
 
11. Type Uncategorized Expenses (the account name) in the Account field.
 
 Select the Account field, which is on the second line of the register 
transaction, and begin typing Uncategorized Expenses, the account 
name. As soon as you type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure 
out what you’re typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you.
 
12. Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Expenses 
adjustment transaction.
 
 Figure 3-18 shows the Opening Balance Equity register with the 
correction transactions. The correction transactions are numbered with 
a 3 and a 4. See them? They’re the first transactions in the register.
You can close the Opening Bal Equity register at this point. You’re finished 
with it. One way to close it is to click the Close button (the little X button in 
the upper-right corner of the window).
You can check your work thus far — and checking it is a good idea — 
by producing another copy of the trial balance report. What you want to 
check are the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expenses account 
balances. They should both be zero, as shown in Figure 3-19.

You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪Accountant & 
Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a docu-
ment window. If you need to enter the conversion date in the As Of box, click 
the box, and type the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
If the Uncategorized Income and the Uncategorized Expenses account 
balances don’t show zero, you (with my help, of course) might have botched 
the accrual adjustment. To fix the mistake, redisplay the Opening Bal Equity 
register (as noted earlier, you can double-click Opening Bal Equity in the 
For accountants only
If you’re reading this sidebar, I assume that 
you’re an accountant who’s been asked to help 
your client with the last piece of the QuickBooks 
conversion. Of course, you understand double-
entry bookkeeping, and presumably you’re 
familiar with the general mechanics involved in 
converting to new accounting systems. With 
those two caveats, you’re ready to start.
First, your client has probably already installed 
QuickBooks and then, by running something 
called the EasyStep Interview, partially set up a 
Chart of Accounts and loaded three master 
files: the Item list, the Customer list, and the 
Vendor list. The Item list master file describes 
the inventory account balances. (QuickBooks 
uses an average costing assumption.) The 
Customer list master file describes the accounts 
receivable balances. The Vendor list master file 
describes the accounts payable balances. 
Because your client has set up these master 
files, QuickBooks has made three journal 
entries, which I describe in the following 
paragraphs. (I’m using Xs to represent 
numbers, in case you’re not familiar with this 
convention.)
To set up the conversion date inventory balance 
(if inventory exists), QuickBooks created the 
following entry:
 
Debit 
Credit
Inventory Asset 
$X,XXX
Opening Bal Equity 
 
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts receiv-
able (A/R) balance (if A/R exists), QuickBooks 
created the following entry:
 
Debit 
Credit
Accounts Receivable 
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Income 
 
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts payable 
(A/P) balance (if A/P exists), QuickBooks 
created the following entry:
 
Debit 
Credit
Accounts Payable 
 
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Expenses $X,XXX
To complete the picture, you need to do two 
little housekeeping chores. If your client plans 
to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to 
get rid of the credit to the Uncategorized Income 
account and the debit to the Uncategorized 
Expenses account. (These two accounts are 
really just suspense accounts.) And you need to 
load the rest of the trial balance. I describe the 
steps for accomplishing these tasks in the sec-
tion “Supplying the missing numbers,” toward 
the end of this chapter.

tions, and then check the account, amount, and field (Increase or Decrease). 
If one of the fields is wrong, select the field and replace its contents by typing 
over them.
Supplying the missing numbers
You’re almost done. Really. Your last task is to enter the rest of the trial 
balance amounts into QuickBooks. To perform this task, you need to have a 
trial balance prepared as of the conversion date. If you followed my 
instructions in Chapter 2, you have one. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose either Company➪Make Journal Entries or Accountant➪Make 
Journal Entries.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Make General Journal Entries window, as 
shown in Figure 3-20.
 
2. Type the conversion date in the Date field.
 
 Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the 
date. As you might know by now, you use the MM/DD/YYYY format. For 
example, type 7/31/2009 for July 31, 2009 (or 7312009, if you don’t want 
to put in the slashes).

3. Type each trial balance account and balance that isn’t already in the 
half-completed trial balance.
 
 This step sounds confusing. But remember that you’ve already entered 
your cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable 
account balances, and perhaps even a few other account balances and a 
portion of the Opening Bal Equity account balance as part of the 
EasyStep Interview.
 
 Now you need to enter the rest of the trial balance — specifically, the 
year-to-date income and expense account balances, any missing assets 
or liabilities, and the remaining portion of the Opening Bal Equity. To 
enter each account and balance, use a row of the Make General Journal 
Entries window list box. Figure 3-21 shows how this window looks after 
you enter the rest of the trial balance into the list box rows.
 
4. Click the Save & New button to record the general journal entries that 
set up the rest of your trial balance.

Checking your work one more time
Double-checking your work is a good idea. Produce another copy of the trial 
balance report. Check that the QuickBooks trial balance is the same one that 
you wanted to enter.

79
 Chapter 3: Populating QuickBooks Lists
 
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports➪Accountant & 
Taxes➪Trial Balance. Be sure to enter the conversion date in the data range 
text boxes. If the QuickBooks trial balance report agrees with what your 
records show, you’re finished. 
 
If the QuickBooks trial balance doesn’t agree with what your records show, 
you need to fix the problem. Fixing it is a bit awkward but isn’t complicated. 
Choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Journal. QuickBooks displays a report 
or journal that lists all the transactions that you or QuickBooks entered as 
part of setting up. (The Dates, From, and To text boxes need to specify the 
conversion date.) Scroll through the list of transactions until you get to the 
last one. The last transaction is the one that you entered to set up the rest of 
the trial balance; it names recognizable accounts, and uses familiar debit and 
credit amounts. Double-click this transaction. QuickBooks redisplays the 
Make General Journal Entries window with the botched transaction. Find the 
mistake and then fix the erroneous account or amount by clicking it and 
typing the correct account or amount.
Congratulations! You’re done.

O
kay. You have QuickBooks set up, or maybe you 
were lucky enough to have someone else do all the 
dirty work. All that doesn’t matter now, though, because 
this part is where the rubber really hits the road. You 
need to start using QuickBooks to do a bunch of stuff on a 
regular, and maybe daily, basis. Invoice customers. 
Record customer payments. Pay bills. This part describes 
how you do all these things.

Making Sure That You’re Ready 
to Invoice Customers
I know that you’re probably all set to go. But first, you need to check a few 
things, okay? Good.

84
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
You already should have installed QuickBooks, of course. (I briefly describe 
how in Appendix A.) You should have set up a company and a Chart of 
Accounts in the EasyStep Interview, as I describe in Chapter 2. You also 
should have entered all your lists and your starting trial balance or talked 
your accountant into entering it for you, as I describe in Chapter 3.
As long as you’ve done all this prerequisite stuff, you’re ready to start. If you 
don’t have one of the prerequisites done, you need to complete it before 
going any further.
Sorry. I don’t make the rules. I just tell you what they are.
Preparing an Invoice
After you complete all the preliminary work, preparing an invoice with 
QuickBooks is a snap. If clicking buttons and filling in text boxes are becom-
ing old hat to you, skip the following play-by-play commentary and simply 
display the Create Invoices window — by either choosing Customers➪Create 
Invoices or clicking the Create Invoices icon on the Home page — and then 
fill in this window and click the Print button. If you want more help than a 
single sentence provides, keep reading for step-by-step instructions. 
 
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and 
involved invoice around: a product invoice. Some fields on the product invoice 
don’t appear on the service or professional invoice, but don’t worry if your 
business is a service or professional. Creating a service or professional 
invoice works basically the same way as creating a product invoice — you just 
fill in fewer fields. And keep in mind that you start with Steps 1 and 2 no 
matter what type of invoice you create. Without further ado, here’s how to 
create an invoice:
 
1. Display the Create Invoices window by choosing Customers➪Create 
Invoices.
 
 The Create Invoices window appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.
 
2. Select the template or invoice form that you want to use from the 
Template drop-down list, located in the upper-right corner.
 
 QuickBooks comes with predefined invoice form types, including 
Product, Professional, Service, and (depending on how you set up 
QuickBooks and which version of QuickBooks you’re using) a handful of 
other specialized invoice templates as well. Which one appears by 
default depends on which one you told QuickBooks that you wanted to 
use in the EasyStep Interview. You can even create your own custom 
invoice template (or modify an existing one) by clicking the Customize 
button. I describe customizing invoice forms in the “Customizing Your 
Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in this chapter.

85
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Create 
Invoices 
window.
 
 
3. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job by using the 
Customer:Job drop-down list.
 
 Scroll through the Customer:Job drop-down list until you see the 
customer or job name that you need; then click it.
 
4. (Optional) Assign a class to the invoice.
 
 If you use classes to track expenses and income, activate the Class 
drop-down list and select an appropriate class for the invoice. To turn 
this handy way of categorizing transactions on or off (which is overkill 
for some businesses), choose Edit➪Preferences, click Accounting on the 
left, click the Company Preferences tab, and then select or clear the Use 
Class Tracking check box. (Figure 4-1 doesn’t show the Class box.)
 
5. Give the invoice date.
 
 Press Tab several times to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then 
enter the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the fol-
lowing secret codes to change the date:
 
• Press + (the plus symbol) to move the date ahead one day.
 
• Press – (the minus symbol) to move the date back one day.
 
• Press T to change the date to today’s date (as specified by the 
system time that your computer’s internal clock provides).

86
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
• Press M to change the date to the first day of the month (because M 
is the first letter in the word month).
 
• Press H to change the date to the last day of the month (because H 
is the last letter in the word month).
 
• Press Y to change the date to the first day of the year (because, as 
you no doubt can guess, Y is the first letter in the word year).
 
• Press R to change the date to the last day of the year (because R is 
the last letter in the word year).
 
 You can also click the button on the right side of the Date field to 
display a small calendar. To select a date from the calendar, just click 
the date you want. Click the arrows on the top-left and top-right sides 
of the calendar to display the previous or next month.
 
6. (Optional) Enter an invoice number in the Invoice # text box.
 
 QuickBooks suggests an invoice number by adding 1 to the last invoice 
number that you used. You can accept this addition, or if you need to 
have it your way, you can tab to the Invoice # text box and change the 
number to whatever you want.
 
7. Fix the Bill To address, if necessary.
 
 QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can 
change the address for the invoice by replacing some portion of the 
usual billing address. You can, for example, insert another line that says 
Attention: William Bobbins, if that’s the name of the person to whom the 
invoice should go.
 
8. Fix the Ship To address, if necessary.
 
 I feel like a broken record, but here’s the deal: QuickBooks also grabs 
the shipping address from the Customer list. So if the shipping address 
has something unusual about it for just this one invoice, you can change 
the address by replacing or adding information to the Ship To address 
block. Note that QuickBooks will keep track of each of the shipping 
addresses you use for a customer, so if you used a shipping address 
before, you may be able to select it from the Ship To drop-down list.
 
9. (Optional, sort of) Provide the purchase order number in the P.O. 
Number text box.
 
 If the customer issues purchase orders (POs), enter the number of the 
purchase order that authorizes this purchase. (Just for the record, PO is 
pronounced “pee-oh,” not “poh” or “poo.”)
 
10. Specify the payment terms by selecting an option from the Terms 
drop-down list.
 
 I have only one request: Don’t offer a customer an early payment 
discount without reading the first couple sections in Chapter 21. Please. 
I’m only looking out for your welfare. Really.

87
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
 
11. (Optional) Name the sales representative.
 
 Rep doesn’t stand for Reputation, so don’t put three-letter editorial 
comments in here (although I can’t, for the life of me, imagine what 
you could do with three letters). If you want to track sales by sales 
representative, use the Rep drop-down list. Simply activate the list by 
clicking its arrow and then pick a name. Sales representatives can 
include employees, but they can also include other people that you’ve 
entered in your other lists. To quickly add a sales rep, select Add New 
and then use the handy-dandy dialog boxes that QuickBooks displays. 
To work with the Sales Rep list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor 
Profile Lists➪Sales Rep List.
 
12. Specify the shipping date, if it’s something other than the invoice date.
 
 To specify the date, simply move the cursor to the Ship text box and 
then type the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can move the cursor by 
pressing Tab or by clicking the text box.
 
 Oh — one other quick point: Remember all those secret codes that 
I talk about in Step 5 for changing the invoice date? They also work for 
changing the shipping date.
 
13. Specify the shipping method.
 
 You can probably guess how you specify the shipping method, but 
parallel structure and a compulsive personality force me to continue. So 
to specify the shipping method, move the cursor to the Via drop-down 
list, activate the list, and then select a shipping method.
 
 By the way, you can add new shipping methods to the list by choosing 
Add New and then filling out the cute little dialog box that QuickBooks 
displays. Setting up new shipping methods is truly easy.
 
14. Specify the FOB point by using the F.O.B. text box.
 
 FOB stands for free-on-board. The FOB point is more important than it 
first seems — at least in a business sense — because the FOB point 
determines when the transfer of ownership occurs, who pays freight, 
and who bears the risks of damage to the goods during shipping.
 
 If a shipment is free-on-board at the shipping point, the ownership of the 
goods being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the goods leave 
the seller’s shipping dock. (Remember that you’re the seller.) In this 
case, the purchaser pays the freight and bears the risk of shipping 
damage. You can specify the FOB shipping point either as FOB Shipping 
Point or by using the name of the city. If the shipping point is Seattle, for 
example, FOB Seattle is the same thing as FOB Shipping Point. Most 
goods are shipped as FOB Shipping Point, by the way.

88
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 If a shipment is free-on-board at the destination point, the ownership of 
the goods that are being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the 
goods arrive on the purchaser’s shipping dock. The seller pays the 
freight and bears the risk of shipping damage. You can specify the FOB 
destination point either as FOB Destination Point or by using the name 
of the city. If the destination point is Omaha, for example, FOB Omaha is 
the same thing as FOB Destination Point.
 
15. Enter each item that you’re selling.
 
 Move the cursor to the first row of the Quantity/Item Code/Description/
Price Each/Amount/Tax list box. Okay, I know that isn’t a very good 
name for it, but you know what I mean, right? You need to start filling in 
the line items that go on the invoice. After you move the cursor to a row 
in the list box, QuickBooks turns the Item Code field into a drop-down 
list. Activate the Item Code drop-down list of the first empty row in the 
list box and then select the item.
 
 When you select the item, QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price 
Each text boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you’ve 
entered in the Item list. (You can edit the information for this particular 
invoice if you need to.) Enter the number of items sold in the Quantity 
text box. (After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the 
amount by multiplying Quantity by Price Each.) If you need other items 
on the invoice, use the remaining empty rows of the list box to enter 
each one. If you marked the Taxable check box when you added the item 
to the Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that 
the item will be taxed. If the item is nontaxable (or you feel like being a 
tax evader for no good reason), click the Tax column and select Non.
 
 You can put as many items on an invoice as you want. If you don’t have 
enough room on a single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as 
necessary to the invoice. Information about the invoice total, of course, 
goes only on the last page.
 
 Click the Add Time/Costs button at the bottom of the form to display the 
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. Use this dialog box to select 
costs that you’ve assigned to the customer or job. Use the Items tab to 
select items purchased for the job. Use the Expenses tab to select reim-
bursable expenses and enter markup information. Use the Time tab to 
select billable time recorded by the Timer program, the Weekly 
Timesheet, or in the Time/Enter Single Activity window.
 
16. Enter any special items that the invoice should include.
 
 If you haven’t worked much with the QuickBooks item list, you have no 
idea what I’m talking about. (For more information about adding to and 
working with lists in QuickBooks, cruise through Chapter 3.) 
 
 To describe any of the special items, activate the Item Code drop-down 
list of the next empty row and then select the special item. After 
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price Each text boxes, edit this 

89
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
information (if necessary). Describe each of the other special items — 
subtotals, discounts, freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the 
invoice by filling in the empty rows in the list box.
 
 If you want to include a Discount item and have it apply to multiple 
items, you need to stick a Subtotal item on the invoice after the 
inventory or other items that you want to discount. Then stick a 
Discount item directly after the Subtotal item. QuickBooks calculates 
the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.
 
17. (Optional) Add a customer message.
 
 Click in the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and 
select a clever customer message. To add customer messages to the 
Customer Message list, choose Add New and then fill in the dialog box 
that QuickBooks displays. (I know that I talk about the Customer 
Message box in Chapter 3, but I wanted to quickly describe how to add a 
customer message again so that you don’t have to flip back through a 
bunch of pages.)
 
18. Specify the sales tax.
 
 If you specified a tax rate in the Customer list, QuickBooks uses it as a 
default. If it isn’t correct, move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate 
the drop-down list, and select the correct sales tax.
 
19. (Truly optional) Add a memo.
 
 You can add a memo description to the invoice if you want to. This 
memo doesn’t print on invoices — only on the Customer Statement. 
Memo descriptions give you a way of storing information related to an 
invoice with that invoice. Figure 4-2 shows a completed Create Invoices 
window.
 
20. If you want to delay printing this invoice, clear the To Be Printed 
check box that’s below the column of buttons in the lower-left area of 
the Create Invoices window.
 
 I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check 
box does until I finish the discussion of invoice creation. I talk about 
printing invoices a little later in the chapter. I promise.
 
21. Save the invoice by clicking the Save & New button or the Save & 
Close button.
 
 QuickBooks saves the invoice that’s on-screen. If you click Save & New, 
QuickBooks displays an empty Create Invoices window so that you can 
create another invoice.
 
 You can page back and forth through invoices that you created earlier 
by clicking the Next and Previous buttons.
 
 When you’re done creating invoices, you can click the invoice form’s 
Save & Close button. Or click the Close button, also known as the Close 
box, which is the little red box marked with an X in the upper-right 
corner of the window.

Fixing Invoice Mistakes
I’m not a perfect person. You’re not a perfect person. Heck, nobody is; 
everyone makes mistakes. You don’t need to get worked up over mistakes 
that you make while entering information in invoices, though, because 
in the following sections, I show you how to fix the most common mistakes 
that you might make on your invoices.
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen
If the invoice is still displayed on-screen, you can just move the cursor to the 
box or button that’s wrong and then fix the mistake. Because most of the bits 
of information that you enter in the Create Invoices window are short and 
sweet, you can easily replace the contents of some fields by typing over 
whatever’s already there. To start all over again, just click the Clear button. 
To save the invoice after you’ve made your changes, click Save & New.
 
If you need to insert a line in the middle of the invoice, right-click to display a 
contextual menu and then choose Insert Line or Delete Line.

91
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen
If the invoice isn’t displayed on-screen but you haven’t yet printed it, you can 
use the Next and Previous buttons to page through the invoices. When you 
get to the one with the error, simply fix the error as I describe in the preced-
ing section. If you make an error fixing the invoice, you can click the Revert 
button to go back to the saved invoice. The Revert button replaces the Clear 
button when you’re viewing an existing invoice — that is, an invoice that 
you’ve already saved.
If you printed the invoice, you also can make the sort of change that I 
describe in the preceding paragraphs. For example, you can page through 
the invoices until you find the one (now printed) that has the error. And you 
can change the error and print the invoice again. I’m not so sure that you 
want to go this route, however, if you’ve already sent out the invoice. You 
might want to consider fixing the invoice by issuing either a credit memo 
(if the original invoice overcharged) or another invoice (if the original invoice 
undercharged). The reason why I suggest issuing a credit memo (which I 
show you how to do in the appropriately titled section, “Preparing a Credit 
Memo,” later in this chapter) or another invoice is that life gets awfully messy 
if you and your customer have multiple copies of the same invoice floating 
around and causing confusion.
Deleting an invoice
I hesitate to mention this, but you also can delete invoices. Procedurally, 
deleting an invoice is easy. You just display the invoice in the Create Invoices 
window and choose Edit➪Delete Invoice. When QuickBooks asks you to 
confirm your deletion, click Yes. Read the following paragraph first, though, 
because you may not want to delete the invoice.
 
Even though deleting invoices is easy, it isn’t something that you should do 
casually or for fun. Deleting an invoice is okay if you’ve just created it; only 
you have seen it, and you haven’t yet printed it. In this case, no one needs to 
know that you’ve made a mistake. It’s your secret. The rest of the time — even 
if you create an invoice that you don’t want later — you should keep a copy of 
the invoice in the QuickBooks system. By doing so, you have a record that the 
invoice existed, which usually makes it easier to answer questions later.
“But how do I correct my books if I leave the bogus invoice?” you ask.
Good question. To correct your financial records for the invoice that you 
don’t want to count anymore, simply void the invoice. The invoice remains in 
the QuickBooks system, but QuickBooks doesn’t count it because it loses its 
quantity and amount information. Good news — voiding an invoice is as 
simple as deleting one. Just display the invoice in the Create Invoices window 
and then choose Edit➪Void Invoice.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Preparing a Credit Memo
Credit memos can be a handy way to fix data-entry mistakes that you didn’t 
find or correct earlier. Credit memos are also handy ways to handle things 
like customer returns and refunds. If you’ve prepared an invoice or two in 
your time, you’ll find that preparing a QuickBooks credit memo is a lot easier 
than using old-fashioned methods.
 
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and 
involved kind of credit memo: a product credit memo. Creating a service 
or professional credit memo works basically the same way, however. You just 
fill in fewer fields.
 
1. Choose Customers➪Create Credit Memos/Refunds or click the 
Refunds & Credits icon in the Customer section of the Home page.
 
 The Create Credit Memos/Refunds window is displayed (as shown in 
Figure 4-3).
 
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job in the Customer:Job 
drop-down list.
 
 You can select the customer or job from the list by clicking it.
 
Figure 4-3: 
The Create 
Credit 
Memos/
Refunds 
window.
 

93
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
 
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the credit memo.
 
 If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class 
drop-down list and choose the appropriate class for the credit memo.
 
4. Date the credit memo. (Going steady is optional.)
 
 Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then enter the 
correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the secret 
date-editing codes that I describe in the section “Preparing an Invoice,” 
earlier in this chapter. Oh, boy.
 
5. (Optional) Enter a credit memo number.
 
 QuickBooks suggests a credit memo number by adding 1 to the last 
credit memo number you used. You can accept the number or tab to the 
Credit No. text box to change the number to whatever you want.
 
6. Fix the Customer address, if necessary.
 
 QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can 
change the address for the credit memo by replacing some portion of 
the usual billing address. Typically, you should use the same address for 
the credit memo that you used for the original invoice or invoices.
 
7. (Optional, sort of) Provide the purchase order (PO) number.
 
 If the credit memo adjusts the total remaining balance on a customer 
purchase order, you should probably enter the number of the purchase 
order into the P.O. No. text box.
 
 Here’s my logic on this suggestion, for those readers who care: If you 
bill your customer $1,000 on P.O. No. 1984, which authorizes a $1,000 
purchase, you “use up” the entire purchase order — at least according 
to the customer’s accounts payable clerk, who processes your invoices. 
If you make sure that a credit memo for $1,000 is identified as being 
related to P.O. No. 1984, however, you essentially free up the $1,000 
purchase balance, which might mean that you can use, or bill on, the 
purchase order again.
 
8. If the customer is returning items, describe each item.
 
 Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/
Amount/Tax text box. In the first empty row of the box, activate the 
Item drop-down list and then select the item. After you select it, 
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes with whatever 
sales description and sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can 
edit this information if you want, but it isn’t necessary.) Enter the 
number of items that the customer is returning (or not paying for) in the 
Qty text box. (After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the 
amount by multiplying Qty by Rate.) Enter each item that the customer 
is returning by filling in the empty rows of the list box.

94
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 In the case of inventory items, QuickBooks assumes that the items 
you’re showing on a credit memo are returned to inventory. You will 
want to adjust your inventory physical counts if unsold items are 
returned.
 
 As with invoices, you can put as many items on a credit memo as you 
want. If you don’t have enough room on a single page, QuickBooks 
keeps adding pages to the credit memo until you’re finished. The total 
information, of course, goes on the last page.
 
9. Describe any special items that the credit memo should include.
 
 If you want to issue a credit memo for other items that appear on the 
original invoice — freight, discounts, other charges, and so on — add 
descriptions of each item to the Item list.
 
 To add descriptions of these items, activate the Item drop-down list 
of the next empty row and then select the special item. (You activate 
the list by clicking the field once to turn it into a drop-down list and 
then by clicking the field’s down arrow to access the list box.) After 
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, edit this 
information (if necessary). Enter each special item — subtotal, discount, 
freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the credit memo.
 
 If you want to include a Discount item, you need to stick a Subtotal 
item on the credit memo after the inventory or other items that you’ve 
discounted. Then stick a Discount item directly after the Subtotal item. 
In this way, QuickBooks calculates the discount as a percentage of the 
subtotal.
 
10. (Optional) Add a customer message.
 
 Activate the Customer Message list and select a clever customer 
message.
 
11. Specify the sales tax.
 
 Move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate the list box, and then select 
the correct sales tax.
 
12. (Optional, but a good idea) Add a memo.
 
 You can use the Memo text box to add a memo description to the credit 
memo. I suggest that you use this description to explain your reasons 
for issuing the credit memo and to cross-reference the original invoice 
or invoices. Note that the Memo field prints on the Customer Statement. 
Figure 4-4 shows a completed Create Credit Memos/Refunds window.
 
13. If you want to delay printing this credit memo, clear the To Be Printed 
check box.
 
 I want to postpone talking about what checking the To Be Printed check 
box does until I finish the discussion of credit memo creation. Coverage 
of printing invoices and credit memos comes up in a later section.

95

14. Save the credit memo.
 
 To save a completed credit memo, click either the Save & New or the 
Save & Close button. QuickBooks saves the credit memo that’s on-
screen and then, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Create 
Credit Memos/Refunds window so that you can create another credit 
memo. (Note that you can page back and forth through credit memos 
that you created earlier by clicking the Next and the Previous buttons.) 
When you’re done creating credit memos, you can click the credit 
memo form’s Close button.
 
See the Use Credit To button at the top of the Create Memos/Refunds window? 
If you want, you can click that button to display a menu of commands. The 
commands let you tell QuickBooks what you want to do with the newly 
created credit memo: give a refund or apply to invoice. If you choose one 
of these commands, QuickBooks asks for the additional information it needs. 
For example, if you indicate that you want to apply the credit memo to an 
invoice, it’ll ask, “Hey, dude, which invoice?”
To print a refund check, click the Use Credit To button, and choose Give 
Refund. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window and automatically fills 
out the check, linking it to the memo.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Fixing Credit Memo Mistakes
Sure, I can repeat the same information that I gave you in the section “Fixing 
Invoice Mistakes,” earlier in this chapter, and leave you with a strange feeling 
of déjà vu. But I won’t.
 
Here’s everything you need to know about fixing credit memo mistakes: 
You can fix credit memo mistakes the same way that you fix invoice 
mistakes. If you need more help, refer to the earlier section “Fixing Invoice 
Mistakes.”
Printing Invoices and Credit Memos
As part of setting up QuickBooks, you selected an invoice type. I assume that 
you have the raw paper stock for whatever invoice type you chose. If you’re 
going to print on blank letterhead, for example, I assume that you have 
letterhead lying around. If you decide to use preprinted forms, I assume that 
you’ve ordered those forms and have received them.
I also assume that you’ve already set up your printer. If you’ve ever printed 
anything, your printer is already set up. Really.
Loading the forms into the printer
This part is easy. Simply load the invoice forms into the printer the same way 
you always load paper. Because you have one of about a jillion different 
printers, I can’t give you the precise steps that you need to take, but if you’ve 
used a printer a bit, you should have no problem.
 
Wait a minute. What’s that? Your printer is brand new, and you’ve never used 
it before? Okay, here’s one of my weird ideas: Use a pencil or something else 
that’s heat resistant (so that it won’t melt and gum up the insides of the 
printer) to draw an arrow on a piece of paper. (Do not, repeat, do not use 
crayon. And don’t let your children watch you do this.) Draw the arrow so that 
it points toward the top edge of the paper. Load the paper in the printer, 
with the arrow face up, and note which direction the arrow is pointing. Print 
something. Anything. When the paper comes out, notice whether the image 
faces the same direction as the arrow and whether it’s on the same side of the 
paper as the arrow. With this information and a little logic, you should be able 
to figure out how to load forms correctly.

97
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
Setting up the invoice printer
You need to set up the invoice printer only once, but you need to specify a 
handful of general invoice-printing rules. These rules also apply to credit 
memos and purchase orders, by the way.
To set up your printer for invoice printing, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup. From the Form Name drop-down list, 
choose Invoice.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Printer Setup dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-5.
 
2. Select the printer that you want to use to print invoices.
 
 Activate the Printer Name drop-down list to see the installed printers. 
Select the one that you want to use for printing invoices and purchase 
orders.
 
3. (Optional) Select the printer type.
 
 The Printer Type drop-down list describes the kind of paper that your 
printer uses. You have two choices:
 
• Continuous: Your paper comes as one connected ream with 
perforated edges.
 
• Page-Oriented: Your paper is in single sheets.
 
4. Select the type of invoice form.
 
 Select the option button that describes the type of form that you want to 
print on: Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. Then 
select the Do Not Print Lines around Each Field check box if you don’t 
like the nice little boxes that QuickBooks creates to separate each field.
 
 For more on these types of forms, read the sidebar, “What am I 
printing on?”
 
5. (Optional, but a good idea) Print a test invoice on real invoice paper.
 
 Click the Align button. When QuickBooks displays the Align Printer 
dialog box, choose the type of invoice that you want to print from the 
list and then click OK. When QuickBooks displays the Fine Alignment 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-6, click the Print Sample button to tell 
QuickBooks to print a dummy invoice on whatever paper you’ve loaded 
in the invoice printer.
 
 The dummy invoice that QuickBooks prints gives you a chance to 
see what your invoices will look like. The invoice also has a set of 
alignment gridlines that prints over the Bill To text box. You can use 
these gridlines if you need to fine-align your printer.

Setup dialog

Figure 4-6:

6. Fix any form-alignment problems.
 
 If you see any alignment problems after you complete Step 5, you 
need to fix them. (Alignment problems usually occur only with impact 
printers. With laser printers or inkjet printers, sheets of paper feed into 
the printer the same way every time, so you almost never need to fiddle 
with the form alignment.)
 
 To fix any big alignment problems — like stuff printing in the wrong 
place — you need to adjust how the paper feeds into the printer. When 
you finally get the paper loaded as best you can, be sure to note exactly 
how you have it loaded. You need to have the printer and paper set up 
the same way every time you print.
 
 For minor (but nonetheless annoying) alignment problems, use the Fine 
Alignment dialog box’s Vertical and Horizontal boxes to adjust the 
form’s alignment. Then print another sample invoice. Go ahead and 
experiment a bit. You need to fine-tune the printing of the invoice form 
only once. Click OK in the Fine Alignment dialog box when you finish to 
have QuickBooks redisplay the Printer Setup dialog box.
 
 Clicking the Options button in the Printer Setup dialog box (refer to 
Figure 4-5) opens the selected printer’s Windows printer setup informa-
tion, where you can do such things as specify quality settings or 
print order. Because this information relates to Windows and not to 

99
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
QuickBooks, I’m not going to explain it. If you’re the curious type or 
accidentally click it and then have questions about what you see, refer 
either to your Windows user’s guide or the printer’s user’s guide.
 
7. Save your printer settings.
 
 After you finish fiddling with all the Printer Setup dialog box settings, 
click OK to save your changes.
 
 If you always want to use some particular settings to print a particular 
form (maybe you always print two copies of an invoice, for example), 
see the “Customizing Your Invoices and Credit Memos” section, later in 
this chapter.
You can print invoices and credit memos one at a time or in a batch. How 
you print them makes no difference to QuickBooks or to me, your humble 
author. Pick whatever way seems to fit your style the best. The following 
sections show you how.
Printing invoices and credit 
memos as you create them
If you want to print invoices and credit memos as you create them, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Print button after you create the invoice or credit memo.
 
 After you fill in the boxes in the Create Invoices window (refer to Figure 
4-2) or the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure 4-4), 
click the Print button. QuickBooks, ever the faithful servant, displays 
either the Print One Invoice dialog box (as shown in Figure 4-7) or the 
Print One Credit Memo/Refund dialog box (which looks almost like the 
Print One Invoice dialog box).
 
2. (Optional) Select the type of invoice or credit memo form.
 
 If you’re using a different type of invoice or credit memo form than 
you’ve described for the invoice printer setup, select the type of form 
that you want to print from the Print On radio button choices. You can 
select Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead.
 
 You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test invoice or credit 
memo forms or fiddling with form alignment problems if you addressed 
these issues when you set up the invoice printer, so I’m not going 
to talk about the Align button here. If you want to do this kind of stuff 
and you need help, refer to the preceding section, “Setting up the 
invoice printer,” in which I describe how to print test forms and fix 
form-alignment problems.

dialog box.
 
 
3. Print the form.
 
 Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints 
the form.
 
4. Review the invoice or credit memo and reprint the form, if necessary.
 
 Review the invoice or credit memo to see whether QuickBooks printed 
it correctly. If the form looks wrong, fix whatever caused the problem 
(perhaps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint 
the form by clicking the Print button again.
Printing invoices in a batch
If you want to print invoices in a batch, you need to mark the To Be Printed 
check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Invoices 
window. This check mark tells QuickBooks to put a copy of the invoice 
on a special invoices-to-be-printed list.
When you later want to print the invoices-to-be-printed list, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Display the Create Invoices window (choose Customers➪Create 
Invoices), click the arrow next to the Print button, and choose Print 
Batch from the drop-down list.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Select Invoices to Print dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-8. This box lists all the invoices that you marked as To Be 
Printed that you haven’t yet printed.

101
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
 
2. Select the invoices that you want to print.
 
 Initially, QuickBooks marks all the invoices with a check mark, indicating 
that they will be printed. You can select and deselect individual invoices 
on the list by clicking them. You also can click the Select All button 
(to mark all the invoices) or the Select None button (to deselect all 
the invoices).
 
3. Click OK.
 
 After you correctly mark all the invoices you want to print — and none 
of the ones you don’t want to print — click OK. QuickBooks displays the 
Print Invoices dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-9.
 
4. (Optional) Select the type of invoice form.
 
 If you use a different type of invoice form than you described during the 
invoice setup, select the type of form that you want to print on by using 
the Print On options. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank 
Paper, or Letterhead.
 
 For more on these types of forms, read the nearby sidebar “What am I 
printing on?”
 
5. Print the forms.
 
 Click the Print button to send the selected invoice forms to the printer. 
QuickBooks prints the forms and then displays a message box that asks 
whether the forms printed correctly.
What am I printing on?
Sometimes people get confused about the dif-
ference between preprinted forms, letterhead, 
and plain paper. Here’s the scoop: Preprinted 
forms have your company name, perhaps your 
logo, and a bunch of other boxes and lines 
(often in another color of ink) already printed on 
them. Preprinted forms are often multipart 
forms. (Examples of preprinted forms come in 
the QuickBooks box.)
Letterhead is what you usually use for letters 
that you write. It has your company name and 
address on it, for example, but nothing else. To 
save you from having to purchase preprinted 
forms, QuickBooks enables you to use letter-
head to create invoices and forms. (To make the 
letterhead look a little more bookkeeperish, 
QuickBooks draws lines and boxes on the let-
terhead so that it looks sort of like a preprinted 
invoice.)
Plain paper is, well, plain paper. Nothing is 
printed on it. So QuickBooks needs to print 
everything — your company name, all the 
invoice stuff, and (optionally) lines and boxes. 
Not that you care, but in my CPA practice, I use 
high-quality plain paper to bill my clients and 
find that approach works just great.

6. Review the invoice forms and reprint them if necessary.
 
 Review the invoices to see whether QuickBooks printed them all 
correctly. If all the forms look okay, click OK in the message box. If one 
or more forms don’t look okay, enter the invoice number of the first bad 
form in the message box. Then fix whatever problem fouled up the form 
(perhaps you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint 
the bad form(s) by clicking the Print button again. (The Print button is 
in the Print Invoices dialog box.)
Printing credit memos in a batch
If you want to print credit memos in a batch, you need to check the To Be 
Printed check box that appears in the lower-left corner of the Create Credit 
Memos/Refunds window. Selecting this box tells QuickBooks to put a copy of 
the credit memo on a special credit memos to-be-printed list.

103
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
 
Printing credit memos in a batch works similarly to printing invoices in a 
batch. Because I describe how to print invoices in a batch in the preceding 
section, I speed here through the following description of printing credit 
memos in a batch. If you get lost or have questions, refer to the preceding 
section.
When you’re ready to print the credit memos that are on the to-be-printed 
list, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure 
4-4), click the down arrow next to the Print button, and choose Print 
Batch from the drop-down list.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Select Credit Memos to Print dialog box.
 
2. Select the credit memos that you want to print.
 
3. Click OK to display the Print Credit Memos dialog box.
 
4. Use the Print Credit Memos dialog box to describe how you want your 
credit memos to be printed.
 
5. Click the Print button to send the selected credit memos to the 
printer.
 
 QuickBooks prints the credit memos.
Sending Invoices and Credit 
Memos by E-Mail
If you have e-mail already set up on your computer, you can e-mail invoices 
rather than print them. To e-mail an invoice or credit memo, click the Send 
button, which appears at the top of the Create Invoices window. (The button 
shows a picture of a little envelope with a green arrow.) QuickBooks displays 
the Send Invoice dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-10.
To send your invoice via e-mail, enter the e-mail address of the business that 
you want to bill or refund money to, edit the message as appropriate (make 
sure to click that Check Spelling button), and then click the Send Now button.
 
If you want to wait to send your invoice, click the Send Later button while in 
the Send Invoice dialog box or select the To Be E-Mailed check box in the 
lower-left corner of the invoice window, and QuickBooks batches your e-mail 
invoices. You can send the entire batch later by clicking the arrow next to the 
Send button and choosing the Send Batch command. Note that QuickBooks 
also has a mailing service that you can sign up for. To get the dirt on this 
option, click the Send button and choose the Mail Invoice command from the 
menu that QuickBooks displays.

104
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 4-10:

You can also fax invoices and credit memos from inside QuickBooks if you 
have a modem installed. To do this, click the Print button at the top of the 
Create Invoices or the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, choose your 
fax/modem from the Printer Name drop-down list, and then use the wizard 
that appears to send the fax via your modem. (Long-distance charges 
may apply.)
Customizing Your Invoices 
and Credit Memos
With QuickBooks, you can easily customize the invoice and credit memo 
templates, or create new invoices and credit memos based on one of the 
existing QuickBooks templates. All you have to do is open the form that 
you want to customize and click the Customize button. When QuickBooks 
displays the Basic Customization dialog box (see Figure 4-11), confirm that 
you’re working with the correct form template. If you’re not working with 
the right form template, click the Manage Templates button and choose the 
template you want to customize from the list that QuickBooks displays. Then 
use the Logo & Fonts options and the Company & Transaction Information 
options to make your changes.
 
QuickBooks doesn’t allow you to do much customization of its existing default 
templates. Accordingly, you may want to make a copy of a default template 
and then use that a starting point.

105
 Chapter 4: Creating Invoices and Credit Memos
To add a logo to the invoice form, check the Use Logo check box, click the 
Select Logo button, and then use the dialog box that QuickBooks displays to 
identify the graphic image file that shows your logo. (This is a neat way to 
personalize your invoices.)
To fiddle-faddle with the colors used on your invoice or to noodle around 
with the fonts used for the invoice text, experiment with the Change Color 
Scheme box or the Change Font For box and the Change Font button.
From the Company & Transaction Information text boxes, you can choose 
what you want in the header, footer, and fields of your invoice and in 
what order you want the information. You can choose which information 
should print and which should appear on-screen. You can rename the fields 
and columns.
 
Here’s the most important thing you should know about this invoice 
customization stuff. When you make your changes, the Preview area shows 
what the customizations look like, so go hog wild and be adventurous. (If you 
make a mess, just click Cancel to abandon your customization changes. Then, 
if you want, restart the process — perhaps a bit wiser and smarter for the 
experience.)
If you’re creating a new invoice template, click the Layout Designer button in 
the Basic Customization dialog box to open the Layout Designer window, as 
shown in Figure 4-12. In this window, you can become a true layout artist and 
observe how the overall look of your invoice changes when you move fields 
around the page with your mouse.

In This Chapter
 Recording and printing sales receipts
 Discovering special tips for retailers
 Fixing sales receipt mistakes
 Recording customer payments
 Correcting mistakes in recording customer payments
 Tracking customer open invoices and collections
 Assessing finance charges
You need to record the amounts that customers pay you when they fork 
over cash, at the time of a sale or after you invoice them. In this chapter, 
I describe how to record these payments and explain how to make bank depos-
its, track the amounts that customers owe and pay, and assess finance charges.
 
If you’ve been using QuickBooks to prepare customer invoices, you’re ready 
to begin recording payments. You’ll have no problem. If you haven’t been 
invoicing customers, you need to make sure that you have a couple of things 
ready to go before you can record cash sales.
First, you need to make sure that your lists are up to date. (I describe updat-
ing these lists in Chapter 3.) Second, if you want to print sales receipts, 
you need to have your printer set up to print them. You do so by choosing 
File➪Printer Setup and then selecting Sales Receipt from the Form Name 
drop-down list. Setting up your printer to print sales receipts works just like 
setting it up to print invoices and credit memos (as I describe in Chapter 4).
Recording a Sales Receipt
You record a sales receipt when a customer pays you in full for the goods at 
the point of sale. Sales receipts work similarly to regular sales (for which you 
first invoice a customer and then later receive payment on the invoice). In 
fact, the big difference between the two types of sales is that sales receipts 

108
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
are recorded in a way that changes your cash balance rather than your 
accounts receivable balance.
In the following steps, I describe how to record sales receipts for products, 
which are the most complicated type of cash sale. Recording sales receipts 
for services works basically the same way, however. You simply fill in fewer 
fields.
 
1. Choose Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt.
 
 Or, on the Home screen, click the Create Sales Receipts icon. Or, in the 
Customer Center, choose the customer from the list and then choose 
New Transactions➪Sales Receipts. The Sales Receipt Template appears 
with the customer already selected at the top.
 
 The Enter Sales Receipts window appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
 
 Your Enter Sales Receipts window may not look exactly like mine for 
a couple of reasons. The first is that QuickBooks customizes its forms 
to fit your particular type of business. The second reason is that forms 
in QuickBooks are truly easy to customize. You can customize the 
Sales Receipt form by clicking the Customize button in the Enter Sales 
Receipts window.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The Enter 
Sales 
Receipts 
window, 
strangely 
empty and 
perhaps a 
bit lonely.
 

109
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
 
 Customizing sales receipt forms works in a similar way to customizing 
invoices and credit memos, as I describe in Chapter 4. If your Enter Sales 
Receipts window includes more fields than I describe here, you can also 
turn to that chapter for help on how to fill out the additional fields or 
turn them off.
 
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
 
 Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list by clicking the down arrow 
to the right of the box. Scroll through the Customer:Job list until you 
see the customer or job name that you want and then click it. Note that 
unlike with invoices, the Customer:Job field is not required for cash 
sales.
 
3. (Optional) Specify a class for the sales receipt.
 
 If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class 
drop-down list and select the appropriate class for the sales receipt. 
(I don’t show the Class list box in Figure 5-1, so don’t look for it there.)
 
4. Date the sales receipt.
 
 Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then type the cor-
rect date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can change the date by using any 
of the date-editing codes. (You can find these codes in Chapter 4 and on 
the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book.)
 
5. (Optional) Enter a sale number.
 
 QuickBooks suggests a cash sale number by adding 1 to the last cash 
sale number you used. Use this number, or tab to the Sale No. text box 
and change the number to whatever you want.
 
6. Fix the Sold To address, if necessary.
 
 QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list and uses 
the billing address as the Sold To address. You can change the address 
for the cash sale, however, by replacing the appropriate part of the 
usual billing address.
 
7. Record the check number.
 
 Enter the customer’s check number in the Check No. text box. If the cus-
tomer is paying you with cold hard cash, you can leave the Check No. 
text box empty.
 
8. Specify the payment method.
 
 To specify the payment method, activate the Payment Method drop-
down list and select something from it: cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, 
or whatever. If you don’t see the payment method that you want to use, 
you can add the method to the Payment Method list. Choose Add New 
to display the New Payment Method dialog box. Enter a description of 
the payment method in the text box and click OK.

110
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
9. Describe each item that you’re selling.
 
 Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/Amount/
Tax list box. When you do, QuickBooks turns the Item field into a drop-
down list. Activate the Item drop-down list of the first empty row in the 
list box and then select the item. When you do, QuickBooks fills in the 
Description and Rate text boxes with whatever sales description and 
sales price you entered in the Item list. (You can edit this information if 
you want, but that probably isn’t necessary.) Enter the number of items 
sold in the Qty text box. (QuickBooks then calculates the amount by 
multiplying the quantity by the rate.) Describe each of the other items 
you’re selling by filling in the next empty rows of the list box.
 
 
If you add an inventory item to an invoice, QuickBooks adds a small 
button to the Quantity field when the cursor rests on the Quantity field. 
If you click the button, QuickBooks displays a window that describes the 
on-hand quantities of the inventory item. Also, if you try to sell more of 
an item than what you hold in inventory, QuickBooks displays a pop-up 
message alerting you that you do not have a sufficient quantity in stock.
 
 
If you already read the chapter on invoicing customers (Chapter 4), 
what I’m about to tell you will seem very familiar: You can put as many 
items on a sales receipt as you want. If you don’t have enough room on a 
single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as you need to the receipt. 
The sales receipt total, of course, goes on the last page.
 
10. Describe any special items that the sales receipt should include.
 
 If you didn’t set up the QuickBooks item list, you have no idea what I’m 
talking about. Here’s the scoop: QuickBooks thinks that anything that 
you stick on a receipt (or an invoice, for that matter) is something that 
you’re selling. If you sell blue, yellow, and red thingamajigs, you obvi-
ously need to add each of these items to the Item list. But if you add 
freight charges to your receipt, QuickBooks thinks that these charges 
are just another thingamajig and requires you to enter another item in 
the list. The same is true for a volume discount that you want to stick on 
the receipt. And if you add sales tax to your receipt, well, guess what? 
QuickBooks thinks that the sales tax is just another item that needs to 
be included in the Item list. (For more information about working with 
your Item list and adding new items, refer to Chapter 3.) 
 
 To include one of these special items, move the cursor to the next 
empty row in the Item box, activate the drop-down list by clicking the 
arrow on the right side of the box, and then select the special item. After 
QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text boxes, you might need 
to edit this information. Enter each special item — subtotals, discounts, 
freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing on the receipt by filling in the 
next empty rows of the list box.
 
 
If you selected the Taxable check box when you added the item to the 
Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that the 
item will be taxed.

111
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
 
 If you want to include a discount item (so that all the listed items are 
discounted), you need to stick a subtotal item on the receipt after the 
inventory items or other items you want to discount. Then stick the 
discount item directly after the subtotal item. In this way, QuickBooks 
calculates the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.
 
11. (Optional) Add a customer message.
 
 Click in the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and 
choose a clever customer message. To add customer messages to the 
customer message list, select Add New. When QuickBooks displays the 
New Customer Message box, fill it in and then click OK.
 
12. Specify the sales tax.
 
 If you specify tax information when you create your company file during 
the EasyStep Interview — remember how QuickBooks asked whether 
you charge sales tax? — QuickBooks fills in the default tax information 
by adding the taxable items (which are indicated by the word Tax in 
the Tax column) and multiplying by the percentage you indicated when 
you created your company file. If the information is okay, move on to 
Step 13. If not, move the cursor to the Tax box that’s to the right of the 
Customer Message box, activate the drop-down list, and choose the cor-
rect sales tax. For more information about setting a default sales tax for 
a customer on the Customer list, read Chapter 3.
 
13. (Truly optional and probably unnecessary for cash sales) Add a memo 
in the Memo text box.
 
 You can include a memo description with the cash sale information. 
This memo isn’t for your customer. It doesn’t even print on the cash 
receipt, should you decide to print one. The memo is for your eyes only. 
Memo descriptions give you a way to store information that’s related to 
a sale with the sales receipt information.
 
14. Decide whether you’re going to print the receipt.
 
 If you aren’t going to print the receipt, make sure that the To Be Printed 
check box is empty — if not, click it to remove the check.
 
 Figure 5-2 shows a completed Enter Sales Receipts window.
 
15. Save the sales receipt.
 
 To save a completed sales receipt, click either the Save & Close button 
or the Save & New button. QuickBooks saves the sales receipt that’s 
on-screen and then, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Enter 
Sales Receipts window so that you can create another sales receipt. 
(Note that you can page back and forth through receipts that you cre-
ated earlier by clicking the Next and Previous buttons.) When you’re 
done creating sales receipts, you can click the Enter Sales Receipts win-
dow’s Close button.

Printing a Sales Receipt
To print a single sales receipt as you’re recording the information, click the 
Print button in the Enter Sales Receipts window. The Print One Sales Receipt 
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-3. The following steps tell you how 
to complete this dialog box:
 
1. Select the type of sales receipt form.
 
 If you’re using a different sales receipt form type than you described 
for the invoice/purchase order (PO) printer setup, select the type of 
form that you want to print on by selecting a radio button in the Print 
On section. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or 
Letterhead. (See Chapter 4 for more on these printer options.)
 
 You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test receipts or fiddling 
with form alignment problems if you addressed these issues during the 
invoice/PO printer setup, so I’m not going to talk about the Align button 
here. If you want to print a test receipt or need to change the alignment, 
read Chapter 4 for how to proceed.

113
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
 
2. Print that puppy!
 
 Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints 
the sales receipt.
 
3. Review the sales receipt and reprint the form, if necessary.
 
 Review the sales receipt to see whether QuickBooks printed it correctly. 
If the form doesn’t look okay, fix whatever problem fouled up the print-
ing; perhaps you forgot to include the company name and address, for 
example. Then reprint the form by clicking the Print button (in the Enter 
Sales Receipts window) again, selecting the form on which you want to 
print (again), and then clicking the Print button in the Print One Sales 
Receipt dialog box (you got it — again).
 
To print a batch of receipts, make sure that you select the To Be Printed 
check box on each receipt that you want to print and then display the Enter 
Sales Receipts window, click the arrow beside the Print button, and choose 
Print Batch from the drop-down list. QuickBooks displays the Select Receipts 
to Print dialog box, which enables you to choose which receipts to print. 
Select the desired receipts by putting a check mark in the first column and 
then click OK. The Print Sales Receipts dialog box appears. This dialog box 
resembles the Print One Sales Receipt dialog box in just about every way, and 
the instructions work in exactly the same manner. For help with this dialog 
box, refer to the sections on printing invoices and credit memos in batches in 
Chapter 4.
Special Tips for Retailers
Are you a retailer? If so, you’re probably saying, “Hey, idiot, what you just 
described is way too much work to do every time someone walks into the 
store and buys some $3 item.”
You know what? You’re right. So here’s what retailers do to record their 
sales. Retailers record the day’s sales by using one, two, or three sales 
receipt transactions. Retailers don’t record each individual sales receipt 
transaction.
 
Say that a coffee mug retailer sold 2,500 red coffee mugs for the day for $3.50 
each. In that case, at the end of the day, the retailer needs to record total sales 
of $8,750 and then the sales tax. (In my example here, sales tax is 8.8 percent.) 
With these example numbers, the daily sales would be recorded using a sales 
receipt transaction like the one shown in Figure 5-2.
Straightforward, right? And that’s not too much work, all things considered.

114
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 5-3: 
The Print 
One Sales 
Receipt 
dialog box.
 
Let me share a handful of other tips for recording retail sales:
 
 You probably want to record a sales receipt transaction for each 
deposit you make. In this manner, you can indicate that a particular 
sales receipt transaction (really a batch of sales) is deposited at one 
time into your bank account — which makes reconciling your bank 
account relatively easy.
 
 You probably want to separate cash sales from credit card sales 
because often credit card sales are handled differently. Your credit 
card processing company, for example, might hold on to credit card 
sales for a few days, or it might deduct a fee before depositing the 
money into your bank account. You want to record a separate sales 
receipt transaction for each deposit that you make (or some other com-
pany makes) into the bank account — again, to make reconciling the 
bank account easier.
 
 If you don’t use the Item list to monitor your inventory (because you 
have way too many items to store in the QuickBooks Item list), use 
items that are designated as non-inventory parts. For example, you 
might use non-inventory part items, such as daily cash sales, daily AmEx 
sales, and daily Visa/MC sales if you make three deposits every day 
for cash and check sales, for American Express sales, and for Visa and 

115
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
MasterCard sales. If you don’t track inventory in your items file, your 
CPA handles the inventory and cost of goods sold calculations on your 
tax return. He or she probably also records a journal entry transaction 
to get your account balances right as of the end of your fiscal year.
 
 You may want to look at the QuickBooks Point of Sale system. The 
QuickBooks Point of Sale system makes it easy to quickly record cash 
register sales. In fact, the more expensive version of the QuickBooks 
Point of Sale system comes with a scanner, a receipt printer, and a cash 
drawer. When you ring up a sale with the QuickBooks Point of Sale 
system, the software automatically records your sales and the effect on 
inventory and cost of goods sold.
 
 You also may not want to use inventory items to track your inventory 
if you’re a retailer. You may instead want to use non–inventory part 
items or generic non-inventory part items. In this way, QuickBooks won’t 
track the quantity of items that sell — only the dollar amounts of your 
sales.
Correcting Sales Receipt Mistakes
If you make a mistake in entering a sales receipt (cash sale), don’t worry. 
Here’s a list of common problems and how to fix them:
 
 If the sales receipt is still displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt is still 
on-screen, you can move the cursor to the box or button that’s wrong 
and then fix the mistake. Most of the bits of information that you enter 
in the Enter Sales Receipts window are fairly short or are entries that 
you’ve selected from a list. You can usually replace the contents of some 
field by typing over whatever’s already there or by making a couple of 
quick clicks. If you messed up and want to start over from scratch, you 
can click the Clear button. To save a receipt after you’ve entered it cor-
rectly, click either the Save & Close button or the Save & New button.
 
 If you need to insert a line in the middle of a sales receipt, right-click 
where you want to insert the line and choose Insert Line from the short-
cut menu. To delete a line, right-click it and then choose Delete Line 
from the contextual menu.
 
 If the sales receipt isn’t displayed on-screen: If the sales receipt isn’t 
on-screen, and you haven’t yet printed it, you can use the Next and 
Previous buttons to page through the sales receipts. When you get to 
the one with the error, fix the error as I describe in the preceding bullet. 
If you make a mistake while editing a receipt, you can click the Revert 
button to go back to the saved receipt and not save your changes. Note 
that Clear toggles to Revert after you edit a transaction.

116
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 Even if you printed the customer’s receipt, you can make the sort of 
change that I just described. For example, you can page through the 
sales receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you find the 
receipt (now printed) with the error. And you can correct the error and 
print the receipt again. I’m not so sure that you want to go this route, 
however. Things will be much cleaner if you void the cash sale by dis-
playing the sales receipt and choosing Edit➪Void Sales Receipt. Then 
enter a new, correct cash sales transaction.
 
 If you don’t want the sales receipt: You usually won’t want to delete 
sales receipts, but you can delete them. (You’ll almost always be 
in much better shape if you just void the sales receipt.) To delete 
the receipt, display it in the Enter Sales Receipts window (choose 
Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt and then page through the sales 
receipts by using the Next and Previous buttons until you see the cash 
sale that you want to delete) and then choose Edit➪Delete Sales Receipt. 
When QuickBooks asks you to confirm the deletion, click Yes. 
 
 
If you want to see a list of all your cash sales, choose Edit➪Find, and the 
Simple Find screen will appear. Select Transaction Type➪Sales Receipt 
and then click Find. Select the receipt you want to see from the list that 
appears. If you’re already viewing a sales receipt, click Edit➪Find Sales 
Receipts. When you click the Find button, another screen pops up and 
asks for details of the Sales Receipt that you’re looking for. Click the 
Find button on that screen, and QuickBooks gives you a list of your cash 
sales for the criteria you selected.
Recording Customer Payments
If your customers don’t always pay you up-front for their purchases, you need 
to record another type of payment: the payments that customers make to 
pay off or pay down what you’ve invoiced them. To record the payments, of 
course, you first need to record invoices for the customer. If you issue credit 
memos that customers can use to reduce the amounts they owe, you also first 
need to record credit memos for the customer. (Check out Chapter 4 to find 
out how to create and record these items.) The rest is easy.
 
To access a wealth of customer information all on one page, click the 
Customer Center icon at the top of the screen or choose Customers➪
Customer Center. The Customer Center appears, listing outstanding balances 
for all customers and detailed information for the customer selected in the 
Customers & Jobs list.
To display the Receive Payments window, click the Receive Payments icon 
on the Home screen or click the Customer Center icon and select the cus-
tomer you need. Click New Transactions and Receive Payments or choose 

117
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
Customers➪Receive Payments from the top menus. Then describe the 
customer payment and the invoices paid. If you want the gory details, read 
through the following steps:
 
1. Choose Customers➪Receive Payments.
 
 The Receive Payments window appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. (The 
window may ask whether your company accepts credit cards; click Yes 
or No to close the dialog box.)
 
2. Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
 
 Activate the Received From drop-down list and choose the customer 
(and job, if necessary) by clicking its name. QuickBooks lists the open, 
or unpaid, invoices for the customer in the list box at the bottom of the 
window.
 
3. Specify the payment date.
 
 Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box (the one right above 
the Reference # text box), and type the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY 
format. To edit the date, you can use the secret date-editing codes that 
I describe in Chapter 4 and on the Cheat Sheet at the front of the book.
 
Figure 5-4: 
The Receive 
Payments 
window.
 

118
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
4. Enter the amount of the payment.
 
 Move the cursor to the Amount field, and type the customer payment 
amount. Note: If the customer is paying with a credit card and your mer-
chant bank deducts a fee from the individual payments, record the full 
amount of the payment on this payment screen and the merchant fee 
later on the Deposit screen.
 
5. (Optional) Specify the payment method.
 
 Activate the Pmt. Method drop-down list and choose the payment method.
 
6. (Optional) Enter the check number.
 
 You can guess how this works, right? You move the cursor to the 
Reference # field. Then you type the check number from the customer’s 
check. Do you need to complete this step? Naw. But this bit of informa-
tion might be useful if you or the customer later ends up with questions 
about what checks paid for what invoices. So I’d go ahead and enter the 
check number.
 
7. (Optional) Add a memo description.
 
 Use the Memo description for storing a bit of information that will help 
you in some way. Note that this field prints on the Customer Statement.
 
8. If the customer has any outstanding credits, decide whether to apply 
them in this payment.
 
 QuickBooks totals the amounts of any of the customer’s existing credits. 
They can be anything from an overpayment on a previous invoice to a 
return credit or anything else.
 
 When you create a new invoice, QuickBooks notifies you that there are 
credits available on the customer’s account and asks whether you want 
to apply any of them to the new invoice.
 
 If you want to apply a credit memo to a specific open invoice, select 
the invoice and then click the Discounts & Credits button. When 
QuickBooks displays the Credits tab of the Discount and Credits dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 5-5, click the credit memo that you want to 
apply and then click Done.
 
9. Identify which open invoices the customer is paying.
 
 By default, QuickBooks automatically applies the payment to the open 
invoices, starting with the oldest open invoice. You can change this 
application by entering amounts in the Payment column. Simply click 
the open invoice’s payment amount, and enter the correct amount.
 
 You can leave a portion of the payment unapplied, if you want to. 
QuickBooks will then ask what you want to do with the overpayment: 
leave the amount on account to be applied or refund the amount to 
the customer or client. By the way, if you record an underpayment, 
QuickBooks asks whether you want to just leave the unpaid amount sit-
ting there or want to instead write off the remaining balance.

119
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
 
Figure 5-5: 
The Credits 
tab of the 
Discount 
and Credits 
dialog box.
 
 
 If you want to apply the customer payment to the oldest open invoices, 
click the Auto Apply Payment button. If you want to unapply pay-
ments that you’ve already applied to open invoices, click the Clear 
Selections button. Clear Selections and Auto Apply are the same button. 
QuickBooks changes the name of the button, depending on whether 
you’ve already applied payments.
 
10. Adjust the early payment or other discounts, if necessary.
 
 If you offer payment terms that include an early payment discount, 
QuickBooks automatically reduces the open invoice original amount 
(shown in the Orig. Amt. column) by the early payment discount that 
you specify to calculate the adjusted amount due (shown in the Amt. 
Due column) if the payment is dated within the discount period.
 
 To specify any other discounts, select the open invoice that you want to 
adjust. Then click the Discount & Credits button. With little or no hesita-
tion, the Discount tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box appears, 
as shown in Figure 5-6. Type the dollar amount of the discount in the 
Amount of Discount text box. Then specify the expense account that you 
want to use to track discounts by activating the Discount Account drop-
down list and selecting one of the accounts. (Interest Expense is prob-
ably a good account to use unless you want to set up a special expense 
account called something like Discount Expense or Discounts Given.)
 
 When you’re finished, click Done to return to the Receive Payments 
window. (For more information on the costs and benefits of early pay-
ment discounts, see Chapter 21.)

and Credits 
dialog box.
 
 
11. Record the customer payment information.
 
 After you identify which invoices the customer is paying — the 
unapplied amount should probably show as zero — you’re ready to 
record the customer payment information. You can do so by clicking 
either the Save & New button or the Save & Close button. QuickBooks 
saves the customer payment shown on-screen. If you click Save & New, 
QuickBooks displays an empty Receive Payments window so that you 
can enter another payment.
 
 
You can return to customer payments you recorded earlier by clicking 
the Previous button.
Correcting Mistakes in Customer 
Payment Entries
You can correct mistakes that you make in entering customer payments in 
basically the same way that you correct mistakes that you make in entering 
cash sales.

121
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
First, you display the window you used to enter the transaction. In the case 
of customer payments, click the Customer Center icon, and select the cus-
tomer you need. You will see a list of that customer’s transactions on the 
right side. Double-click the payment transaction you want to change, and the 
original payments screen appears. And then you make your changes. Then 
you click Save & Close. Pretty straightforward, right?
 
If you already recorded a deposit that includes the payment you want to 
delete or edit, you need to delete the deposit before you can delete or edit the 
payment.
Making Bank Deposits
Whenever you record a cash sale or a customer payment on an invoice, 
QuickBooks adds the cash to its list of undeposited funds. These undepos-
ited funds could be a bunch of checks that you haven’t yet deposited, or they 
could consist of coinage (currency and coins) or even credit card payments, 
if you accept those.
 
You can also tell QuickBooks to give you the choice of indicating that a par-
ticular payment or sales receipt is deposited directly into a specified account. 
To tell QuickBooks to give you this choice, choose the Edit➪Preferences 
command, scroll down to the Sales & Customers icon, click the Company 
Preferences tab, and then deselect the Use Undeposited Funds as a Default 
Deposit to Account option. After you make this change, QuickBooks adds but-
tons and a box to the lower-left corner of the Enter Sales Receipt and Receive 
Payment windows so that you can indicate into which bank account the 
money is deposited.
Eventually, though, you’ll want to take the money out from under your mat-
tress and deposit it in the bank. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
 
 Alternatively, select Record Deposits on the Home screen in the Banking 
section.
 
 The Payments to Deposit dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7. 
This dialog box initially lists all the payments, regardless of the payment 
method. You can, however, use the View Payment Method Type drop-
down list to indicate that you want to see payments only of a particular 
type — such as credit card payments. (This feature can be pretty handy 
because it lets you batch all your credit card transactions together.)

dialog box.
 
 
2. Select the payments that you want to deposit.
 
 Click a payment or cash receipt to place a check mark in front of it, 
marking it for deposit. If you want to deselect a payment, click it again. 
To deselect all the payments, click the Select None button. To select all 
the payments, click the Select All button. If you have gobs of payments 
to look through, you can also filter the list by clicking View Payment 
Method Type at the top and see only the Cash or Credit Cards to select 
among. If you’re recording credit card payments deposited, you don’t 
need to sort through the check payments, also. They aren’t gone; they 
just don’t appear until you select that type of payment or All.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 After you indicate which payments you want to deposit, click OK. 
QuickBooks displays the Make Deposits window, as shown in Figure 5-8.
 
 
If you need to redisplay the Payments to Deposit dialog box — maybe 
you made a mistake or something, and now you need to go back and fix 
it — click the Payments button at the top of the Make Deposits screen. 
Note, though, that QuickBooks won’t display the Payments to Deposit 
dialog box unless the undeposited funds list still has undeposited pay-
ments in it.
 
4. Tell QuickBooks into which bank account you want to deposit the 
money.
 
 Activate the Deposit To drop-down list and choose the bank account in 
which you want to place the funds.

123

Figure 5-8:

Deposits 
window.
 
 
5. Specify the deposit date.
 
 Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box, and type the cor-
rect date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Use the secret date-editing codes if 
you need to edit the date. (Get these codes from Chapter 4 or the Cheat 
Sheet at the front of the book, if you don’t know them.)
 
6. (Optional) Add a memo description, if you want to.
 
 I don’t know what sort of memo description you would add for a 
deposit. Sorry. A bank deposit is a bank deposit. At least to me.
 
7. Specify the cash-back amount.
 
 If you want cash back from the deposit, activate the Cash Back Goes To 
drop-down list and choose a cash account, such as Petty Cash. Then 
enter a memo in the Cash Back Memo text box and the amount of cash 
back you’re taking in the Cash Back Amount text box.
 
8. Record the deposit by clicking the Save & Close button or the Save & 
New button.
 
 If you click Save & New, QuickBooks displays a new blank Make Deposits 
window.

124
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
If you sometimes take cash from the register or from the day’s collections to 
spend on business supplies, for COD (collect on delivery) payments, and even 
for salaries, you enter the cash payment transaction as another transaction 
line in the Make Deposits window (refer to Figure 5-8). For example, if you use 
$50 from the cash register to pay for office supplies from Acme Office Store, 
you enter another line into the Make Deposits window. You enter Acme Office 
Store into the Received From column, your office supplies expense account 
into the From Account column, and –50 into the Amount column. You use a 
negative amount to reduce the total deposit to the correct amount that is actu-
ally deposited into the checking account and to charge the expense account 
for the amount paid out. This is also where you record the Merchant Fees 
deducted from your credit card deposits mentioned earlier.
Improving Your Cash Inflow
I’m not going to provide a lengthy discussion of how to go about collecting 
cash from your customers. I do, however, want to quickly tell you about a 
couple of other details. You need to know how to monitor what your custom-
ers owe you and how to assess finance charges. Don’t worry, though. 
I explain these two things as briefly as I can.
Tracking the amounts your customers owe
You can track in a couple of ways the amounts that a customer owes. 
Probably the simplest method is to display the Customer Center by choosing 
Customer➪Customer Center. Next, select the customer from the Customers 
& Jobs list (which appears along the left edge of the window). QuickBooks 
whips up a page that lists transactions for the customer. It also shows the 
customer’s contact information. Figure 5-9 shows the Customer Center infor-
mation for a customer.
You also should be aware that QuickBooks provides several nifty accounts 
receivable (A/R) reports. You get to these reports by clicking the Report 
Center icon and choosing Customers & Receivables. Or you can choose 
Reports➪Customers & Receivables. QuickBooks then displays a submenu of 
about a half-dozen reports that describe how much money customers owe 
you. Some reports, for example, organize open invoices into different groups 
based on how old the invoices are. (These reports are called agings.) Some 
reports summarize only invoices or payments. And some reports show each 
customer’s open, or unpaid, balance.

125
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
In Chapter 15, I describe, in general terms, how you go about producing and 
printing QuickBooks reports. So read to Chapter 15 if you have questions. Let 
me also say that you can’t hurt anything or foul up your financial records just 
by printing reports. So go ahead and noodle around.
 
You can print a statement to send to a customer by choosing Customers➪
Create Statements. Use the Select Statements to Print dialog box to describe 
which customers you want to print statements for and the date ranges you 
want the statements to show, and then click Print or E-Mail to print or e-mail 
the statements. Statements are a handy way to remind forgetful customers 
or clients about overdue amounts. You don’t, by the way, need to send state-
ments to everybody for every month. In my CPA practice, I send out state-
ments a couple of times a year to clients with past-due accounts. This friendly 
reminder always produces a handful of quick payments and awkward 
apologies.
Using QuickBooks to write a letter
You can seamlessly integrate your QuickBooks 
data to create collection letters in Microsoft 
Word. You can also use the QuickBooks business 
letter templates to speed the process of writ-
ing business letters. To have QuickBooks help 
you write a letter, choose Company➪Prepare 
Letters with Envelopes. Then choose the sub-
menu command for the type of letter you want 
to create or edit. Or from the Customer Center, 
click the Word icon and choose the letter from 
the menu there.
If you’re creating a collection letter, you can 
specify which customers and jobs you want 
QuickBooks to search for money owed to you. 
You can tell QuickBooks whether you want to 
create a separate letter for each customer who 
owes you money or each job on which you’re 
owed money. You can also specify the limit for 
how overdue an invoice must be to warrant a 
collection letter. After you set the parameters 
and click Next, QuickBooks searches for over-
due invoices that fit your criteria.
If you’re creating a type of letter other than 
a collection letter, QuickBooks offers many 
choices based on whether you’re sending the 
letter to a customer, a vendor, an employee, 
or someone else. For example, you can create 
credit approval, credit denial, or credit request 
letters. You can create birthday or apology 
letters. And you can create faxes or bounced 
check letters, just to name a few.
After you specify the information about the type 
of letter that you want to create, QuickBooks 
asks you a few questions about how you want 
to sign the letter. Then it creates the letter and 
displays it in Microsoft Word so that you can 
edit the letter as necessary and then print or 
save it.

Assessing finance charges
I wasn’t exactly sure where to stick this discussion of finance charges. 
Because finance charges seem to relate to collecting the cash your customers 
owe, I figure that I’m okay talking about assessing finance charges here.
 
QuickBooks assesses finance charges on unpaid open invoices without con-
sidering any unapplied payments. Accordingly, you’ll want to make sure that 
you apply any payments and credit memos to open invoices before assessing 
finance charges.
To assess finance charges, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences; then click the Finance Charge icon in the 
list on the left, and click the Company Preferences tab.
 
 To be able to assess finance charges, you first need to set them up.
 
 
Only the QuickBooks administrator can change the company finance 
charge settings, and he or she can do so only in single-user mode.

127
 Chapter 5: Reeling In the Dough
 
 QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Fig-
ure 5-10. (If you’ve assessed finance charges before, QuickBooks 
displays the Assess Finance Charges window. You can display the 
Preferences dialog box and check or edit your finance charge settings by 
clicking the Settings button in the Assess Finance Charges window.)
 
Figure 5-10: 
The 
Preferences 
dialog box

charges.
 
 
2. Enter the annual interest rate that you want to use to calculate finance 
charges.
 
 Move the cursor to the Annual Interest Rate (%) text box and enter the 
annual interest rate.
 
3. (Optional) Enter the minimum finance charge — if one exists.
 
 Move the cursor to the Minimum Finance Charge text box and enter 
the minimum charge. If you always charge at least $25.00 on a past-due 
invoice, for example, type 25.
 
4. Enter the number of days of grace that you give.
 
 Days of Grace. That sounds kind of like an artsy movie or a serious 
novel, doesn’t it? Basically, this number is how many days of slack 
you’re willing to cut people. If you type 30 in the Grace Period (Days) 
text box, QuickBooks doesn’t start assessing finance charges until 30 
days after the invoice is past due.
 
5. Specify which account you want to use to track the finance charges.
 
 Activate the Finance Charge Account drop-down list, and select an 
Income or Other Income type account.

128
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
6. Indicate whether you want to charge finance charges on finance 
charges.
 
 Does this statement make sense? If you charge somebody a finance 
charge, and he or she doesn’t pay the finance charge, eventually it 
becomes past due, too. So then what do you do the next time you assess 
finance charges? Do you calculate a finance charge on the finance charge? 
If you want to do this — and if state and local laws let you — select the 
Assess Finance Charges on Overdue Finance Charges check box.
 
7. Tell QuickBooks whether it should calculate finance charges from the 
due date or the invoice date.
 
 Select either the Due Date or Invoice/Billed Date option button. As you 
might guess, you calculate bigger finance charges if you start accruing 
interest on the invoice date.
 
8. Tell QuickBooks whether it should print finance charge invoices.
 
 Select the check box for Mark Finance Charge Invoices “To Be Printed” if 
you want to print invoices later for the finance charges that you 
calculate.
 
9. Click OK.
 
 After you use the Preferences dialog box to tell QuickBooks how the 
finance charges should be calculated, click OK.
 
10. Choose Customers➪Assess Finance Charges.
 
 Alternatively, click the Finance Charges icon on the Home screen. The 
Assess Finance Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 5-11. This 
window shows all the finance charges that QuickBooks has calculated, 
organized by customer.
 
11. Give the finance charge assessment date.
 
 Move the cursor to the Assessment Date text box and enter the date 
when you’re assessing the finance charges, which I’m willing to bet is 
the current date. (This date is also the invoice date that will be used on 
the finance charge invoices, if you create them.)
 
12. Confirm which customers you want to be assessed finance charges.
 
 QuickBooks initially marks all the finance charges, which means that 
it sets up a new invoice for each finance charge. (QuickBooks marks 
finance charges with a little check mark.) If you want to unmark (or, 
later, mark) a finance charge, click it. To unmark all the charges, click 
the Unmark All button. To mark all the charges, click the Mark All 
button.
 
 You can produce a collections report for any of the customers or jobs 
listed in the Assess Finance Charges window by selecting the customer 
name and then clicking the Collection History button.

A word of advice from an accountant
While I’m on the subject of tracking what your 
customers owe you, let me share a thought 
about collecting this money. You should have 
firm collection procedures that you follow faith-
fully. For example, as soon as an invoice is a 
week or so past due, it’s very reasonable to 
place a friendly telephone call to the customer’s 
accounts payable department to verify whether 
the customer has received the invoice and is 
in the process of paying. You have no reason 
to be embarrassed because some customer 
is late paying you! What’s more, you may find 
out something surprising and essential to your 
collection. You may discover, for example, that 
the customer didn’t receive the invoice. Or you 
may find out that something was wrong with the 
gizmo you sold or the service you provided.
As soon as an invoice is a month or so past due, 
you need to crank up the pressure. A firm letter 
asking that the customer call you to explain the 
past-due amount is very reasonable — espe-
cially if the customer assured you only a few 
weeks ago that payment was forthcoming.
When an invoice is a couple of months past 
due, you need to get pretty serious. You’ll prob-
ably want to stop selling the customer anything 
more because it’s unclear whether you’ll be 
paid. And you may want to start a formal collec-
tion process. (Ask your attorney about starting 
such a process.)

130
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
13. Click the Assess Charges button.
 
 When the Assess Finance Charges window correctly describes the 
finance charges that you want to assess, click Assess Charges. You’re 
finished with the finance charge calculations and assessments.
I don’t describe how to print invoices that contain finance charges because 
I already slogged through invoice printing in painstaking detail in Chapter 4. 
If you have questions about how to print the invoices, you may want to visit 
that chapter.
Dealing with deposits
While I’m on the subject of improving your cash flow, let me briefly mention 
one other powerful cash flow technique — and discuss the bookkeeping 
required for that technique.
One easy way to improve your cash flow is to accept or require up-front 
deposits or retainers from clients or customers before you do the actual 
work. In other words, before you begin work or order inventory or do what-
ever is the first step in your business for completing a sale, you collect cold, 
hard cash.
Unfortunately, these customer deposits, as they’re called, create a bit of book-
keeping trouble. The question becomes, basically, how do you record a 
check or cash deposit for stuff that you haven’t yet done or sold? You have 
two basic options:
 
 The Easy Way: You can just record a sales receipt for the service or prod-
uct. (See “Recording a Sales Receipt” at the beginning of this chapter.) In 
this way, you count the cash coming into your business. And you recog-
nize the revenue. Note, too, that if the deposit is nonrefundable — and for 
cash flow purposes, the deposit should be nonrefundable — you probably 
should count the revenue when you receive the deposit if you’re a cash-
basis taxpayer. (You probably are a cash-basis taxpayer, but ask your tax 
advisor if you aren’t sure.)
 
 The Precise Way: You can recognize the deposit as a new liability. You 
do this by creating a journal entry that records the increase in your 
cash account and that records the increase in your Customer Deposits 
current liability account. (For help on entering journal entries, refer to 
Chapter 20.) If the deposit is refundable and you’re a cash-basis taxpayer, 
or if you’re an accrual-basis taxpayer, you probably should use this 
way. When your sale is completed and invoiced later, use the Customer 
Deposit item as a minus amount on the sales invoice to move the amount 
from the liability account and apply it to the invoice balance due.

Paying the Bills
In This Chapter
 Using the Write Checks window to pay bills
 Using the accounts payable method to pay bills
 Deleting and editing bill payments
 Reminding yourself to pay bills
 Tracking vehicle mileage
 Paying sales tax
QuickBooks gives you two ways to pay and record your bills. And you 
have many options when it comes to deciding when to pay your bills, 
how to pay your bills, and how to record your bills for the purposes of 
tracking inventory and expenses.
In this chapter, I explain not only how to pay vendor bills but also how to pay 
that all-important bill that so many businesses owe to their state and local 
governments. I’m talking, of course, about sales tax.
Pay Now or Pay Later?
When it comes to paying bills, you have a fundamental choice to make. 
You can either record and pay your bills simultaneously or record your 
bills as they come in but then pay them when they’re due. The first method 
is easiest, as you might guess, because you do everything at once. The 
second method, the accounts payable method, gives you more accurate 
financial records and makes for more precise management of your cash and 
outstanding bills.
If you have a small business with little overhead, you may just as well record 
and pay bills simultaneously. If you need precise measurement of your 
expenses and bills, though — if you want to use what’s termed accrual-basis 
accounting — you should use the accounts payable method of paying bills. I 
should note, too, that using the accounts payable method with QuickBooks is 
not as difficult as it may seem at first.

132
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
And now you’re ready to begin. In the next section, I describe how to pay 
bills by writing checks. A little later in this chapter, in the “Recording Your 
Bills the Accounts Payable Way” section, you find out how to pay bills by 
using the accounts payable method.
Recording Your Bills by Writing Checks
When you record bills by writing checks, you’re doing cash-basis accounting. 
In a nutshell, you count bills as expenses when you write the check to pay 
the bill.
I talk a little bit about cash-basis accounting in Appendix B, but let me say 
here that a trade-off is implicit in the choice to use cash-basis accounting. If 
you use cash-basis accounting — which is what I do in my little business — 
you greatly simplify your bookkeeping, but you lose precision in your 
measurement of your expenses. And you don’t keep track of your unpaid bills 
inside QuickBooks. They just stack up in a pile next to your desk.
As long as you understand this trade-off and are comfortable with it, you’re 
ready to begin using this method, which you do by following the steps I 
provide in the paragraphs that follow.
The slow way to write checks
You can write checks either from the register or from the Write Checks 
window. Using the Write Checks window is the slow way, but it enables you 
to record your expenses and the items (if any) that you purchase. Using the 
Write Checks window is the best choice in the following situations:
 
 You’re paying for an inventory item.
 
 You’re paying for something for which you have a purchase order.
 
 You plan to be reimbursed for the bill that you’re paying.
 
 You want to record what job or class the bill falls under.
To use the Write Checks window to write checks, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
 
 Alternatively, click the Write Checks icon in the Banking section of the 
Home screen. The Write Checks window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1. 
Notice that this window has three parts:

133
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
• The check part on the top, which you no doubt recognize from 
having written thousands of checks in the past.
 
• The buttons on the top and bottom.
 
• The Expenses and Items tabs in the middle of the window. This part 
is for recording what the check is for.
 
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list and choose the account from 
which you want to write this check.
 
 This step is very important if you have more than one account. Make 
sure that you choose the correct account; otherwise, your account 
balances in QuickBooks will be incorrect.
 
3. Specify the check date.
 
 Click the Date box and type the check date. I don’t keep reminding you 
about this, but because I’m still in the early part of this book, remem-
ber that you can enter today’s date by pressing the T key. You can also 
click the button to the right of the Date box to get a pop-up calendar. To 
select a date from the pop-up calendar, click the calendar day that you 
want to use.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
4. Fill in the Pay to the Order Of line.
 
 If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill fea-
ture fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you 
after you start typing the name. (AutoFill does so by comparing what 
you type with names shown in the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and 
Other Names lists.) AutoFill also puts the payee’s address in the Address 
text box.
 
 The AutoRecall feature can even fill out the entire check for you, based 
on the last check that you wrote to this vendor. (You can enable 
AutoRecall by choosing Edit➪Preferences, clicking the General icon, and 
selecting the Automatically Remember Account Or Transaction 
Information check box on the My Preferences tab and then using the 
Automatically Recall Last Transaction For This Name or the Pre-fill 
Accounts For Vendor Based On Past Entries radio buttons.) 
 
 Does the check look all right? Maybe all you need to do is tab around, 
adjusting numbers. Otherwise, read the next 12 steps. (Another 12-step 
program?) In these steps, I explain how to record information about a 
new vendor and pay a check to that vendor in one fell swoop.
 
 If you’ve never paid anything to this person before, the program 
displays a Name Not Found message box after you enter the name on 
the Pay to the Order Of line. You can click either Quick Add or Set 
Up to add the payee name to one of your lists. (To find out how to do so, 
check out the nearby sidebar “To Quick Add or to Set Up?”)
 
5. Type the amount of the check.
 
 Now comes my favorite part. I’ve always found it a big bother to write 
out the amount of checks. I mean, if you write a check for $21,457.00, 
how do you fit Twenty-one thousand, four hundred fifty-seven dollars, and 
no cents on the line? Where do you put those hyphens, anyway?
 
 All you have to do with QuickBooks is enter the amount next to the 
dollar sign and press Tab. When you press Tab, QuickBooks writes out 
the amount for you on the Dollars line. At moments like this, I’m grateful 
to be alive in the 21st century, when computer technology can do these 
marvelous things for me.
 
6. (Optional) Fill in the Address text box.
 
 You need to fill in this box only if the address isn’t there already and if 
you intend to send the check by mail in a window envelope.
 
7. (Optional) Fill in the Memo line.
 
 You can put a message to the payee on the Memo line — a message such 
as “Quit bleeding me dry.” But you usually put an account number on 
the Memo line so that the payee can record your account number.
 
 If you try to click the Save & New button and close the dialog box now, 
QuickBooks tells you that you can’t and tries to bite your leg off. Why? 
Because you can’t write a check unless you fill out the Expenses and 
Items tabs. You use these tabs to describe what the check pays.

135
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
8. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab, and 
enter an expense account name.
 
 Chances are that you want to enter the name of an account that’s 
already on the Chart of Accounts. If that’s the case, move the cursor to a 
field in the Account column; QuickBooks turns the field into a drop-
down list. Click the down arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You 
probably have to scroll down the list to get to the expense accounts. 
Click the one that this check applies to (perhaps it’s Rent). If you need 
to create a new expense account category for this check, choose Add 
New from the top of the list to see the New Account dialog box. Fill in 
the information and then click OK.
 
 What if the money that you’re paying out with this check can be distrib-
uted across two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below 
the account that you just entered. The down arrow shoots down next to 
the cursor. Click the down arrow, and enter another expense account, 
and another, and another, if you want to.
 
9. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the num-
bers around.
 
 If you’re distributing this check across more than one account, make 
sure that the numbers in the Amount column correctly distribute the 
check to the appropriate accounts. Figure 6-2 shows a completed check.
 
Figure 6-2: 
A completed 
check.
 

136
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
10. (Optional) Enter words of explanation or encouragement in the Memo 
column.
 
 Someday, you may have to go back to this check and try to figure out 
what these expenses mean. The Memo column may be your only clue. 
Enter some wise words here: August rent, copier repair, or company party.
 
11. (Optional) Assign the expense to the Customer:Job column.
 
 If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to 
track your expenses by job, enter the name of the customer who is going 
to reimburse you. Click the down arrow to find the customer. Enter an 
amount for each customer or job, if necessary.
 
12. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
 
 You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class 
column. Notice the usual down arrow, which you click to see a list of 
classes. You won’t see the Class column, however, unless you told 
QuickBooks that you wanted to use classes when you created your 
company. (You create the company when you work your way through 
the EasyStep Interview; see Chapter 2.)
 
 If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you have to set 
it up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose 
Edit➪Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog 
box, click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and 
then check the Use Class Tracking check box.
To Quick Add or to Set Up?
If you click Quick Add in the Name Not Found 
message box, you see a Select Name Type 
message box asking whether the payee is a 
Vendor, Customer, Employee, or Other. Most 
likely, the payee is a vendor, in which case you 
click Vendor (but you can, of course, click one 
of the other three options). The address infor-
mation that you write on the check goes in the 
Vendor list — or Customer, Employee, or Other 
Names list, depending on what you clicked. 
(Read Chapter 3 if you’re in the dark about 
adding to your lists.)
Selecting the Set Up option in the Name Not 
Found message box is a little more interesting. 
When you select this option, you also see the 
Select Name Type box. Click Vendor, Customer, 
Employee, or Other. Click OK, and then you see 
the New whatever window (as I discuss in 
Chapter 3) if you’ve already added new vendors, 
customers, or employees to your lists.
By the way, my long-suffering technical editor, 
David, wants me to point out that using the 
Quick Add method is sort of lazy. With Quick 
Add, QuickBooks requires you to collect only a 
minimal amount of information.

137
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
13. Use the Items tab to record what you’re purchasing.
 
 You may be purchasing inventory items, or you may already have filled 
out a purchase order for the items for which you’re paying. If either of 
these cases is so, click the Items tab. If you don’t have a purchase order 
for the items, go on to Step 14. If you do have a purchase order for the 
items, click the Select PO button to see a list of purchases on order with 
this vendor. Check those for which you’re paying, and click OK.
 
 QuickBooks doesn’t show its purchase order (PO) feature unless you 
told it during the EasyStep Interview that you want to use purchase 
orders. If you now think you want to use them, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, 
click the Items & Inventory button, click the Company Preferences tab, 
and then select the Inventory and Purchase Orders Are Active check box
 
14. Move the cursor to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
 
 Notice the down arrow in this column. Click the arrow to see the Items 
list. Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click 
it. If not, choose Add New from the top of the list and fill out the New 
Item window. (Read about this in Chapter 3.)
 
15. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
 
 You can enter all the items that you’re purchasing on this tab. Make sure 
that the Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, 
their cost, and the quantity.
 
 When you finish adding items, you may want to use one of the following 
options that appear in the Write Checks window:
 
• Click the Print button to print the check in the Write Checks 
window. This option doesn’t print all the checks that you have 
written and marked to be printed, however. (I explain how to print 
more than one check at a time in Chapter 10.)
 
• The Clear Splits button deletes any individual amounts that you 
entered for separate expenses or items on the Expenses and Items 
tabs. Then QuickBooks enters the total amount of the check in the 
Amount column on the Expenses tab.
 
• The Recalculate button totals the items and expenses in the 
window. It also puts the total on both the numeric and text amount 
lines of the check.
 
• The To Be Printed check box designates the check for printing. 
Mark this check box if you want to print the check with 
QuickBooks by using your printer and preprinted check forms. 
Clear this check box if you’re recording a handwritten check. 
 
• Check the Online Payment box to tell QuickBooks that you want to 
electronically send the payment information to your bank using an 
Internet connection. You need to set up QuickBooks online banking 
feature, described in Chapter 13, to make online payments.

138
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
16. Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to finish 
writing the check.
 
 Click Save & Close to tell QuickBooks that you want to save the check 
and close the check form. Click Save & New to tell QuickBooks that you 
want to save the check and then display another blank check form. If 
you don’t want to save the check, close the dialog box and then click No 
when QuickBooks asks whether you want to save the check.
 
 You can also use the Next and Previous buttons to move to previously 
written checks or to a blank check form. If you write check number 101, 
for example, clicking Next takes you to check 102 so that you can write 
that one. (Clicking Previous moves you to check 100, in case you need to 
edit a check that you’ve written earlier.)
Well, that’s over with. For a minute there, I thought that it would never end.
The fast way to write checks
If you want to pay a bill that isn’t for inventory, that you won’t be reimbursed 
for, or that you don’t need to track in any way, shape, or form, you can write 
your check directly from the Checking register. This method is the fast and 
easy way to go. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Use Register.
 
 Alternatively, click the Check Register icon in the Banking section on the 
Home page. The register appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. (If you have 
more than one bank account, you have to choose the proper account 
from the drop-down list and click OK.) The cursor is at the end of the 
register, ready and waiting for you to enter check information.
 
2. Fill in the information for the check.
 
 Notice that the entries you make are the same ones that you would make 
on a check. You need to note three things about the register:
 
• If you enter a Payee name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you 
see the Name Not Found message box, and you’re asked to give 
information about this new, mysterious vendor. To see what to do 
next, go read the preceding set of instructions on writing a check 
the slow way.
 
• You have to choose an account name. Chances are that you can 
find the right one in the Account drop-down list; if you can’t, 
enter one of your own. QuickBooks displays the Account Not 
Found message box and asks you to fill in the information about 
this new account.

139
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
• To record a check that pays more than a single expense, click the 
Splits button (in the bottom-left corner of the window) to display a 
little box that you can use to input multiple expense accounts 
and amounts.
 
 As you fill out the register, if you decide that you want to be reimbursed 
for this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the 
Edit Transaction button. You see the Write Checks window; refer to 
Figure 6-1. Follow Steps 3–14 in the preceding section on how to write a 
check the slow way to fill in the Write Checks window. When you finish 
filling in the Write Checks window, click Save & New. You’re back where 
you started, in the register window.
 
3. When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record 
button.
 
 You click Record, of course, to record the check.
 
 By the way, if you realize that you made a mistake and haven’t yet 
clicked Record to record the check, you can click the Restore button to 
go back to square one. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just entered 
so that you can start over again.
 
If you want to print the check (or checks) that you’ve just entered, flip to 
Chapter 10 for details. In the meantime, in Chapter 8, I give you the lowdown 
on keeping your checkbook — so turn there if this discussion of checks 
excites you.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Recording Your Bills the 
Accounts Payable Way
The accounts payable (A/P) way of paying bills involves two steps. The first 
is a trifle on the difficult side, and the second step is as easy as pie. First, you 
record your bills. If you read the section earlier in this chapter on writing 
checks the slow way, you’re already familiar with using the Expenses tab and 
the Items tab to record bills. You need to fill out those tabs for the A/P 
method as well if you want to distribute a bill to accounts, customers, jobs, 
classes, and items. If you read the first half of this chapter, some of what 
follows will be old hat.
After you record your bills, you can go on to the second step: Tell 
QuickBooks which bills to pay. Then QuickBooks writes the checks. You 
print them. You mail them.
To make the A/P method work, you have to record your bills as they come in. 
That doesn’t mean that you have to pay them right away. By recording your 
bills, you can keep track of how much money you owe and how much money 
your business truly has. QuickBooks reminds you when your bills are due so 
that you don’t have to worry about forgetting to pay a bill.
 
When you record bills the accounts payable way, you’re using accrual-basis 
accounting. I explain accrual-basis accounting in Appendix B.
Recording your bills
When a bill comes in, the first thing to do is record it. You can record bills in 
the Enter Bills window or the Accounts Payable register. If you plan to track 
bills by expense and item, you need to use the Enter Bills window. I describe 
that method first. If you have a simple bill to pay that doesn’t need to be 
reimbursed or tracked, skip ahead to the “Paying Your Bills” section, later in 
this chapter.
To record a bill through the Enter Bills window, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bills.
 
 Alternatively, click the Enter Bills icon in the Vendors area on the Home 
page. Figure 6-4 shows the Enter Bills window. You no doubt notice that 
the top half of this window looks a great deal like a check — that’s 
because much of the information that you put here ends up on the 
check that you write to pay your bill. (If you see the word Credit at the 
top of the form rather than Bill, select the Bill radio button in the top-left 
corner. You also can use this screen to enter credit from vendors.)

141
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
Figure 6-4: 
The Enter 
Bills 
window.
 
 
2. Select the name of the vendor whom you’re paying.
 
 If you want to pay this bill to a vendor who’s already on the Vendor list, 
click the down arrow at the end of the Vendor line and choose the 
vendor. (Then QuickBooks automatically fills the Enter Bills window 
with as much information as it can remember.) If this vendor is new, 
QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set Up some information about 
the vendor: the address, credit limit, payment terms, and so on. You 
provide this information in the New Vendor window. If you aren’t 
familiar with this window, make a brief visit to Chapter 3.
 
 If you have one or more unfilled purchase orders with the vendor 
that you select, QuickBooks asks you whether you want to receive 
against a purchase order. Click Yes if you do or No if you don’t. If you 
choose to receive against a purchase order, QuickBooks displays the 
Open Purchase Orders dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-5. It lists the 
open purchase orders you’ve recorded. When you select one or more 
purchase orders to receive against, QuickBooks fills in the items and 
amounts from these orders for you, which you can modify as necessary. 
When you finish with the Purchase Orders dialog box, click OK to get 
back to the Enter Bills window.

142
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 6-5: 
Paying a 
bill against 
a purchase 
order.
 
 
 Hey, you know what? I don’t talk about purchase orders until Chapter 7. 
But here’s the CliffsNotes version: To create a purchase order, which is a 
record of items you order from vendors, choose Vendors➪Create 
Purchase Orders. When QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase 
Orders window, describe your order. You print and edit purchase 
orders, by the way, in the same manner as you print invoices and 
credit memos.
 
3. Select the payment terms that describe when the bill is due.
 
 In the Terms line, open the drop-down list and choose the payment 
terms (if the information isn’t already there from when you set 
up the vendor).
 
4. (Optional) Enter the vendor’s reference number.
 
 If you enter the vendor’s reference number for the bill — this is 
probably just the invoice number or your account number — the 
reference number prints on the voucher that’s part of the printed check.
 
5. (Optional) Enter a memo to describe the bill.
 
 You can enter a note in the Memo text box. The note that you enter 
appears on the A/P register.

143
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
6. Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab and 
enter an expense account name.
 
 Chances are that you want to enter the name of an expense account 
that’s already on the chart of accounts. If that’s the case, click the down 
arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You probably have to scroll 
down the list to get to the expense accounts. (A fast way to move down 
the list is to start typing the account name; you go straight down the 
list.) Click the account that this bill represents. (Most likely, it’s Supplies 
or something like that.)
 
 If you need to create a new expense account category for this bill, 
choose Add New from the top of the list. You see the New Account 
dialog box. Fill in the information, and click OK.
 
 What if the money that you’re paying out because of this bill can be split 
among two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the 
account that you just entered. The down arrow appears. Click it to enter 
another expense account, and another, and another, if you want to.
 
7. Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the 
numbers.
 
 If you’re splitting this bill among several accounts, make sure that the 
numbers in the Amount column add up to the total of the bill.
 
8. (Optional) Enter words of explanation or wisdom in the Memo 
column.
 
9. (Optional) Assign the expense to a Customer:Job.
 
 If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want 
to track your expenses by job, enter the customer who is going to 
reimburse you. Enter an amount for each account, if necessary. You can 
use the down arrow to find customers and then click them.
 
10. (Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
 
 You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class 
column. Notice the usual down arrow, and click it to see a list of classes. 
(You don’t see a Class column unless you told QuickBooks that you 
want to use classes.)
 
 If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you can set it 
up to do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, 
click the Accounting icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then 
select the Use Class Tracking check box.
 
 If you want, click the Recalculate button to total the expenses.
 
11. Use the Items tab to record the various items that the bill represents.
 
 Click the Items tab. Enter the items you purchased and the prices you 
paid for them.

144
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 If you realize after partially completing the bill that the bill does indeed 
pay a purchase order, click the Select PO button, which appears on the 
Items tab of the Enter Bills window.
 
 From the Vendor drop-down list, choose the name of the vendor who 
sent you the bill. In the list of open purchase orders, click in the column 
on the left to put a check next to the purchase order (or orders) for 
which you’re paying. Easy enough? Click OK when you’re done; 
QuickBooks fills out the Items tab for you automatically.
 
12. Move to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
 
 Notice the down arrow in this column. Click it to see the Item list. Does 
the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click that item. 
If not, choose Add New from the top of the list, and fill out the New Item 
window. (See Chapter 3.)
 
13. Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
 
 You can enter all the items you’re purchasing here. Make sure that the 
Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their 
costs, and their quantities. If you want to, click the Recalculate button to 
total the items.
 
14. Save the bill.
 
 Click Save & New to save your record of the bill and then enter another 
bill. Or click Save & Close to record your bill but not enter another bill.
Entering your bills the fast way
You also can enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register. This 
method is faster, but it makes tracking expenses and items more difficult.
If you want to enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts or click the Chart of Accounts icon on 
the Home page.
 
 The Chart of Accounts opens.
 
2. Open the Accounts Payable account.
 
 When QuickBooks displays your Chart of Accounts, double-click the 
Accounts Payable account in the list. You see the Accounts Payable 
register window, as shown in Figure 6-6. The cursor is at the end of 
the register, ready and waiting for you to enter the next bill.

145
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
Figure 6-6:

3. Fill in the information for your bill.
 
 Enter the same information that you would if you were filling in the 
Enter Bills window that I describe at the beginning of this chapter. 
In the Vendor text box, click the down arrow and choose a name from 
the Vendor list.
 
 If you enter a vendor name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you see 
the Vendor Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you to give 
information about this new, mysterious vendor. Either click Quick Add 
to have the program collect the information from the register as you fill 
it out or click Set Up to see the New Vendor dialog box. (I describe the 
choice between Quick Add and Set Up in the “To Quick Add or to 
Set Up?” sidebar, elsewhere in this chapter. I explain how to set up new 
vendors in Chapter 3.)
 
 You have to select an account name. You can probably find the right 
one in the Account drop-down list; if you can’t, enter one of your own. 
You see the Account Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you 
to fill in information about this new account.

146
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 If you decide while you fill out the register that you want to be reim-
bursed for this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click 
the Edit Transaction button to see the Enter Bills window (as shown 
in Figure 6-5). Follow Steps 2–12 in the “Recording your bills” section 
(earlier in this chapter) to fill in the Enter Bills window. When you finish 
filling in the window, click Save & New. You’re back where you started: 
in the Accounts Payable window.
 
 See the Splits button? This Splits button works the same as the Splits 
button in the bank account register window. When you click Splits, 
QuickBooks provides additional rows for inputting expense and class 
information.
 
4. When you fill in all the information, click Record.
 
 The Restore button, located just right of Record, is there in case you fill 
out the register but decide that you want to start all over again before 
you’ve recorded the transaction. Click Restore to clear the information 
on-screen, and you have a clean slate.
Deleting a bill
Suppose that you accidentally enter the same bill twice or enter a bill that 
was meant for the business next door. (Just because you’re tracking bills 
by computer doesn’t mean that you don’t have to look over things carefully 
any more.) Here’s how to delete a bill that you entered in the Accounts 
Payable register:
 
1. Locate the bill in the Accounts Payable register by using one of the 
following methods:
 
• If you know roughly what day you entered the bill, you can scroll 
through the list to find it. The entries are listed in date order. 
(Mark the 1-Line check box to display each bill on one line rather 
than on two lines to make the scrolling go faster.)
 
• If you don’t remember the date, use the Edit menu Find command.
 
 And now, back to the Accounts Payable register window that you have 
in progress. . . .
 
2. Select the bill that you want to delete by clicking anywhere in the bill.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Delete Bill.
 
 QuickBooks confirms that you truly want to delete the transaction. If 
you click OK, it dutifully deletes the bill from the A/P register.

147
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
Remind me to pay that bill, will you?
You could tie a string around your finger, but the best way to make sure that 
you pay your bills on time is to have QuickBooks remind you. In fact, you can 
make the Reminders message box the first thing that you see when you start 
QuickBooks.
To adjust the QuickBooks reminder options, you must be logged on as the 
administrator in single-user mode. Then choose Edit➪Preferences. When 
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Reminders icon 
from the list on the left and then click the Company Preferences tab to access 
the dialog box shown in Figure 6-7. See the Reminders item on the list.
 
Figure 6-7: 
The 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 
Using the Find dialog box
When you can’t remember the information that 
you need to find a particular entry or transac-
tion, you can search for the information by using 
the Find dialog box. For example, if you can’t 
recall when you entered the bill, choose Edit➪ 
Find to open the Find dialog box. Choose a filter 
(the category to search by). The box to the right 
changes to include drop-down list boxes or text 
boxes that you can use to specify what you 
want to search for.
Choose as many filters as you like, but be 
careful to enter information accurately, or 
QuickBooks will look for the wrong information. 
Also, try to strike a balance, choosing only as 
many filters as you truly need in order to find 
your information. The more filters you choose, 
the more searching QuickBooks does, and the 
longer the search takes.
After you finish choosing filters, click the Find 
button, and the transactions that match all your 
filters appear in the list at the bottom of the 
window. Click the transaction that you want to 
examine more closely and then click Go To. 
QuickBooks opens the appropriate window and 
takes you right to the transaction. Very snazzy, 
I do believe.

148
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Make sure that its Show Summary or Show List option button is selected, and 
then give yourself several days’ notice before you need to pay bills by typing 
a number (10 is the default and usually works well) in the Days Before Due 
Date text box, in the Remind Me column.
If you select the Show Summary option (the first button to the right of the 
option), you get a summary of the bills that you owe each time you start 
QuickBooks. If you select Show List (the second button to the right of the 
option), you get the details about each bill.
 
Be sure to review the Reminders window when you start QuickBooks or open 
a new company file. The window lists reminders (such as forms you need to 
print and payments you need to transmit) and tells you which unpaid bills 
you’re supposed to pay. You can see this list by choosing 
Company➪Reminders.
Paying Your Bills
If you’ve done everything right and recorded your bills correctly, writing 
checks is a snap. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Pay Bills.
 
 Alternatively, click the Pay Bills icon located on the home page. You see 
the Pay Bills window, as shown in Figure 6-8.
 
2. Change the Payment Date box (at the bottom) to the date that you 
want to appear on the checks.
 
 By default, this box shows today’s date. If you want another date on the 
payment check — for example, if you’re postdating the check — change 
this date. (See the Cheat Sheet at the beginning of this book for some 
secret date-editing codes.)
 
3. Set a cutoff date for showing bills.
 
 In the Show Bills Due On or Before date box, tell QuickBooks which bills 
to show by entering a date. If you want to see all the bills, select the 
Show All Bills radio button.
 
4. Use the Sort Bills By drop-down list to tell QuickBooks how to sort 
the bills.
 
 You can arrange bills by due date with the oldest bills listed first, 
arrange them alphabetically by vendor, or arrange them from largest to 
smallest.

149
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
 
Figure 6-8: 
The Pay 
Bills 
window.
 
 
5. Identify which bills to pay.
 
 If you want to pay all the bills in the dialog box, click the Select All Bills 
button. If you want to clear all the bills you marked, click the Clear 
Selections button. If you want to pick and choose, click to the left of the 
bill’s due date to pay the bill. A check mark appears where you click. 
Note that after you apply a payment, the Clear Selections button 
replaces the Select All Bills button.
 
6. Change the Amt. to Pay figure if you want to pay only part of a bill.
 
 That’s right — you can pay only part of a bill by changing the number in 
the Amt. to Pay column. (Of course, they can always just send you 
another bill. . . .)
 
7. Get the early payment discount rate on your bills, if any.
 
 You may be eligible for an early payment discount on some bills. To find 
out how much of a discount you get, click the Amt. to Pay field and then 
click the Set Discount button to see the Discount tab of the Discount and 
Credits dialog box. Use the Discount tab’s Amount of Discount box to 
give the dollar amount of the discount. Use the Discount tab’s Discount 
Account box to specify which account should be used for recording the 
money saved through the discount. 

150
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
8. Get a list of credit memos that you can apply to the payment.
 
 Click the Set Credits button to see the Credits tab of the Discount and 
Credits dialog box. If you want to use one of the credits listed to reduce 
the amount of the bill, click it and then click Done.
 
9. Select a payment method.
 
 Use the Payment Method drop-down list to select the payment method 
you want to use: Check or Credit Card. If you have more than one 
checking account or credit card account, click the down arrow next to 
the drop-down list, and select the account that you want to use. If you’ve 
subscribed to and set up the QuickBooks online bill payment feature, 
you have another payment method choice: online payment. I describe 
making online payments in Chapter 13.
 
10. If you plan to print the check, select the To Be Printed option button.
 
 Many businesses use QuickBooks to keep track of checks, but instead of 
printing the checks, they have employees write them by hand. If your 
business uses this method, select the Assign Check Number radio 
button. Then, when QuickBooks asks how it should number the check, 
either give the number by typing it into the appropriate box or tell 
QuickBooks to automatically number the check.
 
11. Click the Pay Selected Bills button to pay the bills and close the Pay 
Bills window.
 
 QuickBooks goes into the Accounts Payable register and notes that 
you paid these bills; then it goes into the Checking register and “writes” 
the check or checks. Figures 6-9 and 6-10 show you exactly what I 
mean. (The two figures show a $2,000 bill from Little Bertha’s Workshop 
being paid.)
 
QuickBooks shows the original bill amount as the amount that’s paid, not the 
original bill amount minus the early payment discount. It needs to use this 
method to completely pay off the bill.
In the Accounts Payable register, you see BILLPMT in the Type column and 
the amount paid in the Paid column. The Due Date and Billed columns are 
now empty.
In the Checking register, you again see BILLPMT in the Type column.
 
Don’t kid yourself — these bills aren’t truly paid yet. Sure, they’re paid in the 
mind of QuickBooks, but the mind of QuickBooks extends only as far as the 
metal (or trendy plastic) box that holds your computer. You still have to write 
or print the checks and deliver them to the payees.
If you’re going to write the checks by hand, enter the check numbers from 
your own checkbook into the QuickBooks register Number column. You want 
these numbers to jibe, not jive. (I know: A pun is the lowest form of humor.)

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
If you plan to print the checks, see Chapter 10.
And another thing: If you enter a bill, you absolutely must use the Pay Bills 
command to record the payment that pays off the bill. If you don’t do this, 
the unpaid bill just sits there forever, lonely and forlorn.
Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks includes a vehicle mileage-tracking feature that lets you track 
your business miles. To track vehicle mileage in QuickBooks, choose 
Company➪Enter Vehicle Mileage. Then, in the Enter Vehicle Mileage dialog 
box that appears, record the vehicle, date, miles driven, odometer settings, 
and reason for the trip. (I talk a bit more about tracking vehicle mileage in 
Chapter 18, so you may want to refer there if this is something you’re inter-
ested in.)
May I briefly tell you the IRS rules for deducting business miles? Essentially, 
you have two approaches to choose between. The easier method — and the 
one that I use, because I’m lazy — is to record as a business expense an 
amount per business mile driven. The rate per mile is roughly $0.60, which is 
far less than the actual cost of driving most cars. But, hey — that’s the price 
of slothfulness.
The hard method for tracking business miles is to track all your vehicle 
expenses — including gas, oil, repairs, insurance, and vehicle depreciation — 
and then record as a business expense the business-use portion of these 
expenses.
To get the business-use portion of your vehicle, you use the ratio of business 
miles to total miles. For example, if over the year, you drive 6,000 business 
miles and your total miles are 12,000, your business-use percentage equals 50 
percent. In this case, you can record as a business expense 50 percent of 
your vehicle expenses.
Usually with the hard “actual expenses” method, you get a higher business 
vehicle expense deduction. However, you should note that the IRS limits the 
amount that you can include as vehicle depreciation, so you don’t get as high 
a deduction as you might at first think. (You may want to consult your tax 
advisor for details.)
No matter which method you use, you want a record of your actual business 
miles, which the Enter Vehicle Mileage command lets you do. By law, you 
need a good record of business mileage to legitimately claim the deduction.

153
 Chapter 6: Paying the Bills
Paying Sales Tax
To ingratiate itself with your retailers, QuickBooks includes a special dialog 
box for paying sales tax. However, to use this dialog box, you have to 
have sales tax items or a sales tax group already set up. See Chapter 3 for a 
thorough explanation of items and groups.
To see how much sales tax you owe and to write checks to government 
agencies in one fell swoop, choose Vendors➪Sales Tax➪Pay Sales Tax to 
access the Pay Sales Tax dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-11. Alternatively, 
click the Pay Sales Tax icon on the Home page in the Vendors area.
 
This dialog box is similar to the Pay Bills window (refer to Figure 6-8). The 
buttons basically work the same way.
Click in the Pay column to add check marks next to all the items that 
you want to pay. QuickBooks automatically writes checks in the 
Checking register. Your payments are likewise recorded in the Sales Tax 
Payable register.

Center Window
If you choose Vendors➪Vendor Center or click the Vendor Center icon, 
QuickBooks displays a window that summarizes a bunch of information 
about the vendor in question. This feature doesn’t actually provide you new 
information. But — and this is noteworthy — it does give you a slick way to 
get all the information you have regarding a particular vendor. Note that you 
can select which vendor’s information appears in the Vendor Center window 
by selecting the vendor from the vendor list that appears at the left edge of 
the window.

F
or small and growing businesses, inventory is one of the toughest assets 
to manage. First, of course, you need to physically care for stuff. Second, 
you’ve got to make sure that you don’t run out of some item or have too 
much of some other item.
QuickBooks (unfortunately) isn’t all that sophisticated in its inventory 
management features, but it is easy to use. And with a little jiggering, you 
can probably get it to work in any simple case. (The one tricky part that I 
talk about a little later in the chapter is what you can do when you keep 
inventory in multiple locations, but I’m going to hold off on that discussion 
for a bit. That’d be like jumping off the deep end of the dock before you learn 
to swim.)
 
If you want to make inventory accounting truly easy and you don’t care about 
a bit of imprecision, take a peek at the last main section of this chapter, “The 
Lazy Person’s Approach to Inventory.”
Setting Up Inventory Items
Before you can track your inventory, you need to do two things. First, tell 
QuickBooks that you want to track inventory. To do this, choose Edit➪
Preferences. When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click 
the Items & Inventory icon in the list on the left. Your screen should look 
remarkably similar to the one in Figure 7-1. (You might have to click the 

156
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Company Preferences tab first.) Make sure that the Inventory and Purchase 
Orders Are Active check box is marked and that one of the Warn If Not 
Enough Inventory to Sell radio buttons is marked.
Here’s the second thing that you need to do: Create an Item list. This list is a 
description of all items that you might conceivably put on an invoice. In 
other words, all items that you order and sell belong on the Item list.
 
You should have set up your initial Item list in the EasyStep Interview (see 
Chapter 2). If you need to add an item to your list, choose Lists➪Item List. 
Then click the Item button, choose New from the drop-down list, and fill in the 
New Item window. If you want the blow-by-blow, go to Chapter 3 and get it 
straight from the horse’s mouth.
After you turn on the inventory stuff and set up (or update) your Item list, 
you can track your inventory.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The 
Preferences 
dialog 
box for 
Purchases 
& Vendors.
 
When You Buy Stuff
As you unload items from a truck, receive them in the mail, or buy them 
from a street peddler, you have to record the items so that QuickBooks 
can track your inventory. How you record the items and pay for them 
depends on whether you pay cash on the barrelhead, receive a bill along 
with the items, or receive the items without a bill (in which case, you pay for 
the items later).
And you may have filled out a purchase order (PO) for the items that you’re 
receiving. If that’s the case, receiving the items gets a little easier. If you 
receive items for which you already filled out a PO, see the section “How 
Purchase Orders Work,” later in this chapter. I strongly recommend filling 
out a PO when you order items that you’re going to receive and pay for later.

157
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
Recording items that you pay for up front
Okay, you just bought three porcelain chickens in the bazaar at Marrakech, 
and now you want to add them to your inventory and record the purchase. 
How do you record inventory you paid for over the counter? By using the 
Write Checks window, of course — the same way you record any other bills 
you pay for up-front. Just make sure that you fill out the Items column as I 
describe in Chapter 6.
Recording items that don’t 
come with a bill
What happens if the items come before the invoice? Lucky you — you have 
the stuff, and you don’t have to pay for it yet. However, you do have to 
record the inventory you just received so that you know you have it on hand. 
You can’t do that in the Write Checks window because you won’t be writing a 
check to pay for the stuff — at least not for a while. How do you record items 
that you receive before paying for them? Read on:
 
1. Either Choose Vendors➪Receive Items or click the Receive Inventory 
icon on the Home screen, and select the option to Receive Inventory 
without a bill.
 
 You see the Create Item Receipts window, as shown in Figure 7-2. This 
window is similar to the Enter Bills window that I describe in Chapter 6, 
but it reads Item Receipt Only. (You see the Enter Bills window again 
when you receive the bill for items.)
 
2. Fill in the top part of the window.
 
 If you want to record items from a vendor who’s already on the Vendor 
list, click the down arrow and then choose the vendor. If the vendor 
is a new vendor, choose Add New from the list and then click Set Up to 
set up information about the vendor: the address, the credit limit, 
payment terms, and so on. You enter the information in the New Vendor 
dialog box.
 
3. Click the Items tab.
 
 You need to click the Items tab only if it isn’t already displayed. It 
probably is. But the computer book writers’ code of honor and a 
compulsive personality require me to tell you that there’s another tab — 
the Expenses tab — and you could possibly display it instead.

158
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
4. Move to the Item column and type a name for the item.
 
 Notice the down arrow in the Item column. Click it to see the Item list. 
Does the item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click it. If 
not, enter a new item name. You see the Item Not Found message box. 
Click Set Up and fill out the New Item dialog box. (See Chapter 3 for help 
with describing new items.)
 
 You may just as well go down the packing slip, entering the items on the 
Items tab. Make sure that the Items tab accurately shows what’s on the 
packing slip. And put a brief description of the items in the Memo field 
because that description might prove useful later when you want to 
match up your item receipt with the bill. When you finish, the Create 
Item Receipts window should look something like what you see in 
Figure 7-2, earlier in this chapter.
 
5. Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to record the 
items that you just received.
 
 The items are officially part of your inventory. The item receipt has been 
entered on the Accounts Payable register. Not only that, but also, you’re 
all ready for when the bill comes.

Item 
Receipts 
window.

 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
Paying for items when you get the bill
The items arrive, and you fill out an item receipt. Three weeks pass. What’s 
this in your mailbox? Why, it’s the bill, of course! Now you have to enter a bill 
for the items that you received three weeks ago. This job is easy:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Enter Bill for Received Items.
 
 Or, from the Home screen, click the Enter Bills Against Inventory icon. 
If you’re on the Vendor Center, click New Transactions and then Enter 
Bill for Received Items. The Select Item Receipt dialog box appears, as 
shown in Figure 7-3.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Select 
Item Receipt 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Click the Vendor drop-down list and choose the name of the vendor 
who sent you the bill.
 
 You see one or more item receipts in the box, with the date you put on 
the receipt, its reference number, and the memo that you wrote on the 
receipt.
 
3. Select the item receipt for which you want to enter a bill and then 
click OK.
 
 The Enter Bills window appears, as shown in Figure 7-4. Does this 
information look familiar? It should — it’s the same information that you 
put in the Create Item Receipts window, only now you’re working with a 
bill, not a receipt.
 
4. Compare the Items tab in the window with the bill.
 
 Are you paying for what you received earlier? Shipping charges and 
sales tax may have been added to your bill. You may also need to 
adjust the price because you may have been guessing when you 
recorded receiving the items. If so, add to and adjust the original receipt 
information by using the Items tab. (You can click the Recalculate 
button to add the new items.)

160
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
 How many days do you have to pay this bill? Is it due now? Take a look 
at the Terms line to see what this vendor’s payment terms are. Change 
the payment terms if they’re incorrect by selecting a different entry from 
the drop-down list. Remember, you want to pay your bills at the best 
possible time, but for you to do so, the terms in the Enter Bills window 
must match the vendor’s payment terms.
 
5. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the bill.
 
 Of course, you still need to pay the vendor’s bill. Fair enough. Take a 
look at Chapter 6 if you need help.
 
Figure 7-4:

Bills 
window.
 
Recording items and paying 
the bill all at once
Suppose that you receive the bill when you receive the goods. The items are 
unloaded from the elephant’s back, and the elephant driver takes a bow and 
hands you the bill. Here are the steps you follow:

161
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Receive Items and Enter Bill.
 
 Or, from the Home screen, click Receive Inventory and then select the 
Receive Inventory with Bill option there. Or, from the Vendor Center, 
click New Transactions and then Enter Bill for Received Items. You see 
the Enter Bills window (refer to Figure 7-4). If you’ve been reading this 
chapter from its beginning, you’re familiar with this window, and you 
know exactly what it is and what it does. If you landed cold turkey on 
this page by way of the index, you need to know, for inventory purposes, 
how to record the items you’re paying for.
 
2. Fill out the top part of the window.
 
 This stuff is basic. Choose a vendor from the drop-down list, and make 
sure that the vendor’s terms for paying this bill are shown correctly. If 
this vendor is new, choose Add New. QuickBooks asks you to fill in an 
information dialog box about the vendor. Do it. Make sure that you fill 
out the Bill Due line correctly.
 
3. Click the Items tab and list all the items that you’re paying for.
 
 To see the Item list, move the cursor to the Item column and click the 
down arrow that appears. Make sure that the quantity and cost of the 
items are listed correctly on the Items tab.
 
4. Click Save & New or Save & Close.
 
 QuickBooks adds the items you listed to the Item list and makes them an 
official part of your inventory.
When You Sell Stuff
In Chapter 4, I tell you how to list the items on the invoice. Maybe you 
noticed the similarities between the Items tab in the Enter Bills window and 
the Quantity/Item Code/Description/Price Each/Amount box at the bottom of 
an invoice. QuickBooks uses both for keeping inventory.
When you sell stuff, QuickBooks automatically adjusts your inventory. In 
other words, if you buy 400 porcelain chickens and sell 350 of them, you have 
only 50 on hand. QuickBooks updates records for this change. No muss, no 
fuss. Gosh, isn’t this great? No more lying awake at night, wondering whether 
you have enough chickens or wombats or whatever. The same thing happens 
when you make cash sales. When you list the items on the sales receipt, 
QuickBooks assumes that they’re leaving your hands and subtracts them 
from your inventory.
 
The moral of this story is “Keep a good, descriptive Item list.” And the other 
moral is “Enter items carefully on the Items tab of checks and bills and in the 
Item/Description/Qty/Rate/Amount box of sales receipts and invoices.”

162
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
How Purchase Orders Work
If you have to order stuff for your business, consider using POs. Create 
QuickBooks POs even if you order goods by phone or by telegraph or even 
via the World Wide Web — that is, whenever you don’t request goods in 
writing. Filling out POs enables you to determine what items you have on 
order and when the items will arrive. All you’ll have to do is ask QuickBooks, 
“What’s on order, and when’s it coming, anyway?” Never again will you have 
to rack your brain to remember whether you’ve ordered those thingamajigs 
and doohickeys.
And when the bill comes, you’ll already have it itemized on the PO form. 
Guess what? Having written out all the items on your PO, you don’t have to 
fill out an Items tab on your check when you pay the bill. Or, if you’re paying 
bills with the accounts payable method, you don’t have to fill out the Items 
tab in the Enter Bills window. (Look at Chapter 6 if you don’t know what I’m 
talking about here.) When the items arrive, all you have to do is let 
QuickBooks know; the items are immediately added to your inventory list.
 
Use POs for items that you order — that is, for items that you’ll receive and 
pay for in the future. If you buy items over the counter or receive items that 
you didn’t order, you obviously don’t need a PO. What you need to do is just 
pay the bill and inventory the items that you just bought, as I explain in the 
first half of this chapter.
Choosing a purchase order form
Before you begin using PO forms, you may want to design a PO form 
especially for your business. To do this designing, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
 
 Or click the Purchase Orders icon on the Home screen; or, from the 
Vendor Center, select New Transactions and then Purchase Orders. 
QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase Orders window.
 
2. Click the Customize button, which appears at the top edge of the 
Create Purchase Orders window.
 
 When QuickBooks displays the Basic Customization dialog box (see 
Figure 7-5), confirm that you’re working with the correct form template. 
Typically, you want to make customizations to the Custom Purchase 
Order template. If you’ve created multiple templates, click the Manage 
Templates button and then choose the template you want to customize 
from the list that QuickBooks displays.

163
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
 
Figure 7-5: 
The Basic 
Custom-
ization 
dialog box.
 
 
3. (Optional) Add a logo.
 
 To add a logo to the PO form, select the Use Logo check box, click the 
Select Logo button, and then use the dialog box that QuickBooks 
displays to identify the graphic image file of your logo. (This is a neat 
way to personalize your POs.)
 
4. (Also optional) Color your world.
 
 To fiddle-faddle with the colors used on your PO or to noodle around 
with the fonts used for the invoice text, experiment with the Select Color 
Scheme list or the Change Font For list and the Change Font button.
 
5. Specify PO information you want.
 
 Use the Company & Transaction Information check boxes to select what 
you want in the header, footer, and fields of your PO and in what order 
you want the information.
 
 Here’s the most important thing you should know about this PO custom-
ization stuff. When you make your changes, the Preview area shows 
what the customizations look like, so go hog-wild. Be adventurous. If you 
make a mess, just click Cancel to abandon your customization changes. 
Then, if you want, restart the process — perhaps a bit wiser for the 
experience.
 
 To get even more creative about your customizations, click the Layout 
Designer button. When the Layout Designer window appears, use the 
mouse to drag fields around the page to make the PO look just the way 
you want. Click OK to return to the Basic Customization dialog box.

164
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
6. When your PO looks magnificent, click OK in the Basic Customization 
dialog box.
 
 QuickBooks returns you to the Create Purchase Orders window.
If you decide that you want to change your PO templates, all you have to do 
is choose Customize again from the Custom Template drop-down list, click 
the Manage Templates button, and choose the template that you want to edit 
from the list that QuickBooks displays.
Filling out a purchase order
Perhaps you’re running low on gizmos or doohickeys or some other item on 
your Item list, and you’re ready to reorder these things — whatever they are. 
Follow these steps to fill out a PO:
 
1. Choose Vendors➪Create Purchase Orders.
 
 Or click the Purchase Orders icon on the Home screen. Or click the New 
Transactions area of the Vendor Center, and select Purchase Orders. 
You see the Create Purchase Orders window, which is similar to what’s 
shown in Figure 7-6. Note that the exact details of this window depend 
on how you customize your PO form.
 
Figure 7-6: 
The Create 
Purchase 
Orders 
window.
 

165
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
 
2. Choose a vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.
 
 Click the down arrow to see a list of your vendors. Click a vendor to 
see its name and address in the Vendor box. If you can’t find the name 
of the vendor on your list, click Add New from the list, and fill in the 
information about the vendor in the New Vendor dialog box.
 
3. If you track your inventory by class, select a class from the Class 
drop-down list.
 
 The Create Purchase Orders window may not have a Class drop-down 
list. If it doesn’t and you want it to have one, you have to set up 
QuickBooks to track expenses by Class. To do so, open the QuickBooks 
file in single-user mode as the administrator. Then choose Edit➪
Preferences and click the Accounting icon in the list on the left. (You 
may also need to click the Company Preferences tab.) Finally, select the 
Use Class Tracking check box.
 
4. (Optional) Select a Rep, an Expected Date, and a FOB (which I 
describe in Chapter 4) if you’re using them on your PO.
 
 You may have to fill in other fields before you get to the item-by-item 
descriptions at the bottom. Again, these fields may not appear if you 
haven’t indicated that you want them on your form.
 
5. Move to the Item column and start entering the items you’re ordering.
 
 Entering the items is the most important part of creating a PO. When 
you move into the Item column, it turns into a drop-down list. Click its 
down arrow to see the Item list. You may need to scroll to the item that 
you want to enter. A fast way to scroll to the item is to type the first few 
letters of the item name. If you type the name of an item that isn’t on the 
Item list, QuickBooks asks whether you want to set up this item. If so, 
click Set Up and then fill in the New Item dialog box.
 
 Enter as many items as you want in the Item column. QuickBooks fills in 
an item description for you, but you can edit whatever it puts into the 
Description column, if need be. In the Qty column, indicate how many of 
each item you need.
 
6. If you want to, fill in the Vendor Message field — and definitely fill in 
the Memo field.
 
 The Message field is where you put a message to the party receiving 
your order. You could write, “Get me this stuff — pronto!”
 
 No matter what you do, be sure to fill in the Memo field. What you write 
in this field appears in the Open Purchase Orders dialog box and is 
the surest way for you to identify what this PO is for. Write something 
meaningful that you can understand two weeks, three weeks, or a month 
from now, when you pay for the items that you’re ordering.
 
 At the bottom of the Create Purchase Orders window is the To Be 
Printed check box, which tells you whether you printed this PO. If you 
want to print the PO, make sure that this check box is selected. After 
you print the PO, the check disappears from the box.

166
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
7. Click Print to print the PO.
 
 If this PO is one of many that you’ve been filling out and you want to 
print several at once, click the arrow beside the Print button and 
choose Print Batch from the drop-down list. Before you print the PO, 
however, you may want to click the down arrow beside the Print 
button and choose Preview to see what the PO will look like when you 
print it. QuickBooks shows you an on-screen replica of the PO. I hope it 
looks okay.
 
 You use the History button after you receive the items you’re so care-
fully listing on the PO. After you receive the items and record their 
receipt, clicking this button tells QuickBooks to give you the entire 
history of an item — when you ordered it and when you received it.
 
 As for the other buttons at the top, I think that you know what those are.
 
8. Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the PO.
 
 QuickBooks saves the PO and displays a new, blank PO window in which 
you can enter another order.
Checking up on purchase orders
You record the POs. A couple of weeks go by, and you ask yourself, “Did I 
order those doohickeys from Acme?” Choose Reports➪Purchases➪Open 
Purchase Orders to see a report that lists outstanding POs. Or click the 
Reports Center, select Purchases in the left column, and click the Open 
Purchase Orders report.
Receiving purchase order items
After your doohickeys and gizmos have arrived by camel train, you need to 
record the receipt of the items and add them to your Item list.
The first two things to do are to note whether the stuff came with a bill 
and then decide how you want to pay for it. These decisions are the same 
ones that you have to make if you receive goods without having first filled 
out a PO.
You record PO items that you receive the same way you record other items 
you receive:
 
 If you pay for PO items with a check, you use the Write Checks window.
 
 If you receive the PO items without a bill, you use the Create Item 
Receipts window.
 
 If you receive the PO items with a bill, you use the Enter Bills window.

167
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
Regardless of the window you’re using, when you select the vendor who 
sold you the PO items, QuickBooks alerts you that open POs exist for the 
vendor and asks you whether you want to receive against a PO. Of course 
you do. (Receive against simply means to compare what you ordered with 
what you received.) When you click Yes, QuickBooks displays the Open 
Purchase Orders dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-7. Select the PO(s) that 
you’re receiving against and then click OK. QuickBooks fills out the Items 
tab to show all the stuff you ordered. If what QuickBooks shows is not what 
you received, you may have to make adjustments.
 
Figure 7-7: 
The Open 
Purchase 
Orders 
dialog box.
 
Assembling a Product
QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise includes a cool tool for accounting for 
the manufacture of items. Suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain, the sample 
business I use in this book, mostly just buys and resells coffee mugs and 
other porcelain doodads. But also suppose that once a year, Pine Lake 
Porcelain assembles a romantic collection of red coffee mugs into a boxed 
St. Valentine’s Day gift set. In this case, QuickBooks can record the assembly 
of a boxed gift set that combines, for example, six red coffee mugs, a 
cardboard box, and some tissue paper.
Identifying the components
 
Each component that makes up the assembly — in this example, the St. 
Valentine’s Day boxed gift set — needs to be an item on your Item list. 
Chapter 3 describes how to add items to the Item list, so I don’t repeat that 
information here. The weird thing about assembly items, however, is that 
the New Item window identifies the parts that make up the assembly. For 
example, the St. Valentine’s Day boxed gift set assembly includes these items: 
six red coffee mugs, a cardboard gift box, and some tissue paper that loved 
ones can use when they become emotionally overwhelmed by the generosity 
of this thoughtful gift. These items get listed as the pieces that make up the 
boxed gift set.

168
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Building the assembly
To build an assembly, choose Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Build 
Assemblies. Or, if you’re on the Home screen, click the Build Assemblies icon 
in the Company area. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window, 
as shown in Figure 7-8. All you do is choose the thing that you want to build 
from the Assembly Item drop-down list and then the quantity that you 
(or some hapless co-worker) built in the Quantity to Build text box. Then you 
click either the Build & Close button or the Build & New button. (Click Build 
& New if you want to record the assembly of some other items.)
While I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the 
Build Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
 
 In the top-right corner (roughly) of the window, QuickBooks shows the 
quantities of the assembly that you have on hand and for which 
customers have placed orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, 
so, hey — remember that it’s there.
 
 The main part of the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes 
into your product. Not that you care, but this is called a bill of materials.
 
Figure 7-8: 
The Build 
Assemblies 
window.
 

169
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
 
 At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the 
maximum number of assemblies you can make, given your current 
inventory holdings.
 
 When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts. 
For example, in the case of boxed gift sets — each with six red coffee 
mugs, one piece of wrapping tissue, and a cardboard box — QuickBooks 
reduces the item counts of red coffee mugs, wrapping tissues, and 
boxes, and increases the item counts of the boxed gift sets when you 
record building the assembly.
 
 Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory 
items. When you use non-inventory parts in an assembly, QuickBooks 
doesn’t care about the item counts.
Time for a Reality Check
 
QuickBooks does a pretty good job of tracking inventory, but you’re still going 
to have to make that complete annual inventory of what you have in stock. 
What I’m saying here is that you’re going to have to go over everything and 
count it by hand. Sorry. You just can’t avoid that chore.
 
QuickBooks will produce a handy physical inventory worksheet that you and 
your minions can use to count inventory. To produce this report, choose 
Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Physical Inventory Worksheet. Then, after 
QuickBooks produces an on-screen version of this worksheet report, click the 
Print button to print hard copies of the worksheet. You can use the printed 
worksheet to record actual physical counts of the inventory items you hold.
After you make your count, what happens if your inventory figures differ 
from those QuickBooks has? First, you have to decide who’s right: you or a 
computer program. You’re right, probably. Products get dropped. They 
break. And that means that you have to adjust the QuickBooks inventory 
numbers.
Choose Vendors➪Inventory Activities➪Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand. Or 
click the Adjust Quantity On Hand icon in the Company section of the Home 
screen. The Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window appears, as shown in 
Figure 7-9.
The first thing to do is choose an account for storing your inventory 
adjustments. Choose it from the Adjustment Account drop-down list. You 
also can select a class from the Class drop-down list.

170
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 7-9: 
The Adjust 
Quantity/
Value on

window.
 
 
For what it’s worth, if it were me, I’d set up and use a special inventory 
adjustments expense account. (That way, I’d have an easy way to see the total 
inventory adjustments over the year.)
Go down the Item column, entering numbers in the New Qty column where 
your count differs from the QuickBooks totals. Click Save & Close when 
you’re done.
Dealing with Multiple 
Inventory Locations
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’ve seen now how QuickBooks 
handles your inventory. It isn’t fancy, but for many businesses, it gets the 
job done.
Unfortunately, I’ve encountered a real headache when using QuickBooks for 
inventory. What if you store inventory in multiple locations — for example, in 
a Michigan warehouse and in a Chicago distribution facility? Or in a couple of 
retail locations — one on the right side of the tracks and the other one on the 
wrong side of the tracks?

171
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
 
The problem is that QuickBooks is set up to deal with a single inventory 
location. So although you can know how much inventory you have in total, 
if you aren’t careful, you won’t know how much is in Michigan and how 
much is in Chicago. And you can’t even check on inventory shrinkage because 
QuickBooks’ records don’t tie to location-specific inventory counts.
Now I need to tell you up-front that you don’t have any good way to deal with 
this in QuickBooks. Throughout the following sections, though, I explain a 
couple of sloppy fixes that you can do.
Manually keep separate inventory-
by-location counts
If you have only a handful of items in your little business — say, a few 
dozen — it’s pretty easy to keep a simple manual running tab on what you 
have in the Michigan warehouse and what’s in the Chicago distribution 
facility.
Such a system is very, er, crude. It may just be a couple of sticky notes taped 
to your computer monitor. No kidding. Still, it lets you know how much 
inventory you’ve got (roughly) and where it’s stored. And for some purposes, 
that works okay.
Use different item numbers 
for different locations
The embarrassingly crude approach that I describe in the preceding section 
doesn’t work if you have a lot of items, so the approach won’t work for a 
multiple-location retailer. Accordingly, if you’re a retailer with a large number 
of items, I’m sorry, but I think you probably need to create sets of item 
numbers for each inventory location. This means a lot more work for you, 
of course, but it’s the only practical way to handle your inventory if you have 
more than a handful of items.
The Lazy Person’s Approach to Inventory
The inventory accounting approach that I describe in the previous para-
graphs of this chapter is the textbook approach. What’s more, the approach 
is a good one because it lets you accurately calculate your cost of goods 
sold and accurately estimate the value of the inventory you’re holding. To 
paraphrase Martha Stewart, these are Good Things.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
You should know, however, that you can also use a simpler approach to 
inventory accounting. Specifically, rather than keep track of individual 
inventory items by using a perpetual inventory system — this simply means 
that you track each item when it moves into your business and out into 
a customer’s car or minivan — you can use a simple periodic system. In 
the sections that follow, I tell you how a periodic inventory system works 
in QuickBooks. Then I tell you what’s bad and what’s good about using 
a periodic inventory system.
How periodic inventory systems 
work in QuickBooks
If you use a periodic inventory system, you set up an Other Current Asset 
type account called Inventory. Then, whenever you purchase inventory, 
you categorize the inventory purchase as falling into this “fake” inventory 
account. (I’m calling the account a fake inventory account because it isn’t a 
real inventory account to QuickBooks.)
To record your cost of goods sold each month, you use a journal entry to 
move an appropriate portion out of the fake inventory account and into your 
cost of goods sold account. How do you know what portion you should 
move? Good question. In a nutshell, you guess based on what your historical 
cost of goods sold percentage is.
Here’s an example of how this works: Suppose that since time immemorial, 
your cost of goods sold has run 45 percent of your sales revenue, and that 
last month, you sold $10,000 of stuff. In this case, you would figure that 45 
percent of $10,000 ($4,500) equals the cost of the inventory that you sold. 
Accordingly, you would move $4,500 out of the fake inventory account and 
into cost of goods sold.
Predictably, this rough-and-ready approach means that your inventory and 
cost of goods sold numbers are going to be wrong. So, at the end of the year, 
you still perform a physical inventory count to figure out exactly what you 
truly hold in inventory. At that point, you’d adjust the inventory and cost of 
goods sold balances so that they match what your physical inventory shows.
For example, it may be that over the course of the year, your rough 45 
percent number has meant that you moved $5,000 too much from inventory 
to cost of goods sold. In this case, you’d move $5,000 out of cost of goods 
sold and back to inventory.
Or you may find that you moved $5,000 too little from inventory to cost of 
goods sold. To fix that problem, you move another $5,000 from inventory to 
cost of goods sold.

173
 Chapter 7: Inventory Magic
A final quick point about using a periodic inventory: As I note in this little 
discussion, you don’t use inventory items if you’re using a periodic 
inventory. So what you put on invoices or sales receipts is just a generic, 
non-inventory part item.
The good and bad of a periodic inventory
A periodic inventory system is good for some types of businesses. For 
example, if you have too many items to track with the QuickBooks Item list, 
the approach that I describe here can be a lifesaver.
 
However, periodic inventory systems create some problems. Here are the four 
biggest and baddest problems in my mind:
 
 You won’t know which items are selling well and which aren’t because 
you won’t be tracking sales by inventory items. This means that you 
won’t be able to stock more of the hot-selling stuff and less of stuff that’s 
not selling.
 
 You won’t know what you truly hold in your inventory except when 
you take that year-end physical inventory. (You won’t know how many 
dollars of inventory you’re holding, nor will you know which item 
quantities you’re holding.)
 
 Because you won’t make item-level adjustments based on your physical 
inventory, you won’t know which items are prone to shrinkage from 
problems such as theft, breakage, and spoilage.
 
 You’ll need to make the journal entries that record the dollars moving 
out of inventory and into cost of goods sold. These journal entries aren’t 
terribly difficult, but they can be a little bit tricky to figure out the first 
few times.
You’ll need to decide whether you want or need to go with a simpler periodic 
inventory system in spite of the problems such a system presents. The 
one final thought that I’ll leave you with is this: Many small businesses — 
especially small retailers — successfully use periodic inventory systems.

I
n a sense, a small business’s finances and cash flows revolve about the 
business’s checkbook. Which means this chapter is mighty important. 
Here, you’re finally going to see how to do those everyday checkbook things 
using QuickBooks: entering checks, deposits, and transfers. Along the way, 
you also find out about some neat tools that QuickBooks provides for making 
these tasks easier, faster, and more precise.
Writing Checks
Chapter 6 shows you the two ways to write checks: from the Write Checks 
window and from the Checking register. In case you were asleep in 
the back row of the class, here’s the short version of the instructions for 
writing checks.
 
You can record debit card and ATM transactions the same way that you 
record checks you write.
Writing checks from the 
Write Checks window
You can record handwritten checks and other checks that you want to print 
with QuickBooks by describing the checks in the Write Checks window.

176
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
To write a check from the Write Checks window, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
 
 You can also click the Write Checks icon located in the Banking section 
of the Home screen. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window, as 
shown in Figure 8-1.
 
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window and 
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
 
 This important step is something that you should always remember to 
do before you write a check if you have multiple bank accounts.
 
3. Enter a check number or mark the check for printing.
 
 Select the To Be Printed check box if you plan on printing the check with 
QuickBooks, using your printer and preprinted check forms that you’ve 
purchased. (I describe this process in Chapter 10.) If you’re recording 
a check you wrote by hand, enter the check number you used for the 
check in the No. text box.
 
Figure 8-1: 
The Write 
Checks 
window.
 

177
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
 
4. Fill in the check.
 
 If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill 
feature fills in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for 
you after you start typing the name. How QuickBooks manages this feat 
may seem akin to magic, but it’s not that tough. QuickBooks just com-
pares what you’ve typed so far with names on your lists of customers, 
employees, and others. As soon as QuickBooks can match the letters 
that you’ve typed with a name on one of these lists, it grabs the name.
 
 If you haven’t written a check to this person or party before, QuickBooks 
asks you to add the payee name. Do that. (If you’re not sure whether you 
want to add a payee or how to add a payee, read through Chapter 6.)
 
 Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign, and then press 
Tab. QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line. 
It also writes out the address if it has been filled out in the payee’s 
master file.
 
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
 
 Don’t know what these are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute detail.
 
6. Click the Save & Close button or the Save & New button to finish writ-
ing the check.
 
 There you have it. Your check is written and entered in the Checking 
register, ready to be printed and mailed.
Writing checks from the Checking register
People who’ve grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin of QuickBooks, might 
want to use the Checking register window to write checks. (Quicken users 
like the register metaphor better, I guess.)
To write a check from the Checking register, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Checking register.
 
 Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon in the 
Banking area of the Home screen. If you have more than one bank 
account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box so that you 
can select the proper account.
 
 From the drop-down list, choose the checking account against which 
you want to write the check and then click OK. You see the Checking 
register window (see Figure 8-2). The cursor is at the end of the register, 
ready for you to enter check information. (QuickBooks automatically 
fills in today’s date.)

178
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 8-2: 
The 
Checking 
register 
window.
 
 
 QuickBooks uses the account name in the window title. This is why 
Figure 8-2 refers to Big Banking Account. That’s the name of the fictitious 
bank account I set up.
 
2. Fill in the information for your check.
 
 Notice that the entries you make in this register are the same ones that 
you would make in the Write Checks window. If you’re more comfortable 
entering checks in that window, you can click the Edit Transaction 
button, which is at the top of the Checking register window, to see the 
Write Checks window in all its glory and write a check there. In fact, if 
you want to enter expenses or itemize what you’re paying for with the 
check, you have to click the Edit Transaction button and get into the 
Write Checks window.
 
 Otherwise, just go from field to field and enter the information in the 
register. Once again, use the drop-down lists to enter the Payee and 
Account names. If you enter a Payee or Account name that QuickBooks 
doesn’t recognize, the program asks you to give more information.
  
 Here’s sort of a trick question: What if the check you’re writing pays 
more than one category of expense? Say you pay your landlord both for 
your rent and for a share of the utilities. Are you limited to one expense 
account? Do you face the mother of all accounting dilemmas — choosing 
between two correct accounts? Well, no, you don’t. You can just click 
the Splits button. QuickBooks displays a splits area that you can use to 

179
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
split a check across several different accounts. For example, a $1,500 
check that pays $1,200 of rent and $300 of utilities can split onto two 
separate lines: one that records the $1,200 of rent expense and one that 
records the $300 of utilities expense.
 
3. When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record 
button.
 
 You can also click the Restore button if you decide that you want to go 
back to start over again. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just 
entered.
 
If you write checks by hand, as opposed to printing them with QuickBooks, 
make sure that the check numbers in the Checking register and the check 
numbers in your checkbook match. You may need to go into the QuickBooks 
Checking register and change numbers in the Number column. When your 
bank statement comes, reconciling your bank statement and your checkbook 
is much easier if you enter check numbers correctly.
Changing a check that you’ve written
What if you need to change a check after you’ve already entered it? Perhaps 
you made a terrible mistake, such as recording a $52.50 check as $25.20. Can 
you fix it? Sure. Just go into the Checking register and find the check that you 
want to change. Go to the Payment or Deposit field, and make the change.
If you have more extensive changes to make (for instance, if the check is a 
split transaction), put the cursor where the check is, and click Edit 
Transaction. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window with the original 
check in it. Make the changes. (Don’t forget to make changes on the Items 
and Expenses tabs, too, if necessary.)
When you finish, click Save & Close. You go back to the Checking register, 
where you see the changes to the check.
 
If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can also use the Next and 
Previous buttons to page through your checks and make any changes.
Packing more checks into the register
Usually, QuickBooks displays two rows of information about each check you 
enter. It also displays two rows of information about each type of transaction 
that you enter. If you want to pack more checks into a visible portion of the 
register, mark the 1-Line check box at the bottom of the Checking register 
window. When you check this box, QuickBooks uses a single-line format to 
display all the information in the register except the Memo field.

180
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Compare Figure 8-2 with Figure 8-3 to see what the 1-Line display looks like. 
Checking registers can get awfully long, and the 1-Line display is helpful when 
you’re looking through a long register for a check or transaction.
 
Figure 8-3: 
The 
Checking 
Register

Paying for items with cash
To track petty cash purchases, you need a petty 
cash account. You can set up a petty cash 
account (which works just like a bank account) 
by following the steps in “Setting up a second 
bank account,” later in this chapter. To record 
purchases that you make from the money in that 
coffee can beside your desk, use the petty cash 
register. You can record cash purchases just 
like you record checks. (Of course, you don’t 
need to worry about using the correct check 
numbers when you record cash purchases; you 
can just use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on.) To 
record cashed checking withdrawals to be 
used for petty cash in the office, just record the 
withdrawal as a transfer to your petty cash 
account, as I describe later in the chapter.

181
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
Depositing Money into 
a Checking Account
You can’t write checks unless you deposit some money in your checking 
account. You didn’t know that? Well, the next time you’re taking your 
exercise in the prison yard, give it some serious thought. From time to time, 
you must deposit money in your checking account and record those deposits 
in the Checking register.
You can record deposits in two ways. Find out about those ways in the 
following sections.
Recording simple deposits
If you have a simple deposit to make — a sum of money that didn’t come 
from one of your customers — just make the deposit directly in the Checking 
register.
 
Suppose that your elderly Aunt Iris sends you $100 with a note explaining how 
more than 80 years ago, Great-Uncle Bert started his hammock manufacturing 
business with only $100, and for good luck, she’s sending you $100 to help 
you along.
Recording a simple deposit is, well, pretty simple. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Checking register.
 
 Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon in the 
Banking section of the Home screen. If you have more than one bank 
account, QuickBooks displays the Use Register dialog box. Select 
the checking account into which you want to make the deposit, and 
click OK. QuickBooks displays the Checking register window (refer to 
Figure 8-2).
 
2. In the Date column, enter the date on which you made the deposit.
 
3. In the Payee column, enter the name of the person or business that 
sent you money.
 
 Don’t worry if QuickBooks adds a check number in the Number field 
when you move to the Payee column. When you enter a deposit amount, 
QuickBooks changes the Number field to DEP (for deposit, of course).
 
4. Enter the amount that you’re depositing.
 
 Move the cursor to the Deposit column and enter the amount.

182
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
5. Enter an account for this deposit.
 
 Move to the Account field, click the down arrow, and choose an account 
from the list. For a gift like this, you’ll likely choose an account like 
Uncategorized Income.
 
6. Click the Record button.
 
 Your deposit is entered, and your checking account’s balance is fattened 
accordingly. Note that all entries in the Checking register are made in 
chronological order, with deposits first and checks next.
Depositing income from customers
Depositing income from customers is a little more complicated if you issue 
invoices and receiving payments because it involves using the Payments to 
Deposit dialog box. Have you been recording customer payments as they 
come in? (You do so by choosing Customers➪Receive Payments or 
Customers➪Enter Sales Receipt, as I describe in Chapter 5; or by selecting 
the Create Sales Receipts or Receive Payments icon on the Home screen; or 
by clicking the Customer Center and selecting New Transactions, Sales 
Receipts, or Receive Payments.) If you’ve recorded customer payments 
and told QuickBooks to group them with your other undeposited funds, 
QuickBooks places these payments in your Undeposited Funds account. 
Now all you have to do is transfer the undeposited funds to your checking 
account. Here’s how:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Make Deposits.
 
 You can also click the Record Deposits icon in the Banking section of the 
Home screen. Because you have undeposited funds, you see the 
Payments to Deposit dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4. This dialog box 
lists the checks that you’ve received but haven’t put in a checking 
account or other bank account yet.
 
 The View Payment Method Type drop-down list lets you see payments 
of only a particular type: cash, check, American Express, and so on. If 
you group deposits by payment type, this list box works as a slick tool 
to group transactions that you’ll deposit together.
 
2. Select the checks that you want to deposit and then click OK.
 
 Place a check mark (click the column) next to the checks that you want 
to deposit. If you want to deposit all the checks, click the Select All 
button.
 
 The Make Deposits window appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. Do you 
recognize the information in the middle of the window? It describes the 
checks that you just selected to be deposited.

183
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
 
 You want to make sure that the Deposit Total shown in the Make 
Deposits window is the right deposit amount — in other words, the 
actual amount truly deposited into the bank account. When you attempt 
to reconcile the bank account, you’ll compare the deposit total shown 
here with your bank statement’s cleared deposits amount.
 
3. Select the checking account to receive these deposits.
 
 Select the account from the Deposit To drop-down list at the top of the 
window. And while you’re at it, check the Date text box to make sure 
that it shows the date you’ll deposit these checks in your checking 
account. In other words, if you’re not going to make it to the bank or the 
ATM until tomorrow, put tomorrow’s date in the Date text box.
 
4. Add any other noncustomer deposits to include on the deposit slip.
 
 If your grandma (bless her heart) gave you 1,000 pennies in 20 rolls, 
for example, that’s an extra $10 that you can record on this deposit 
slip. At the bottom of the list of payments, enter the name of the person 
who gave you the cash, the account, a memo, a check number, the 
payment method (cash, in this case), a class if you’re using classes, and 
the amount.
 
5. (Optional) Write a note to yourself in the Memo box to describe 
this deposit.
 
6. Click the Print button to get a hard copy of the deposit slip.
 
 Many banks accept this deposit slip, so you can print it and put it in the 
envelope with your ATM deposit or hand it to the bank clerk. Whatever 
you write on the memo appears on the Checking register. (You should 
probably write a memo to yourself in case you need to know what this 
deposit is years from now, when you’re old and dotty.)

The 
Payments 
to Deposit 
dialog box.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
Figure 8-5:

window.
 
 
7. Record any cash back that you plan to get with the deposit.
 
 If you need to get cash to replenish your petty cash account, select 
the account from the Cash Back Goes To drop-down list, write a memo, 
and then record the amount of cash that you want to get back from 
the deposit.
 
8. Click the Save & Close button at the bottom of the Make Deposits 
window.
 
 The deposit is recorded in QuickBooks. It appears in your Checking 
register next to the letters DEP.
Transferring Money between Accounts
Account transfers occur when you move money from one account to 
another — for example, from your savings account to your checking account. 
But jeepers, why am I telling you this? If you have one of those combined 
savings and checking accounts, you probably do this sort of thing all 
the time.
Oh, now I remember why I brought this up: QuickBooks makes quick work of 
account transfers as long as you’ve already set up both accounts.

185
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
Setting up a second bank account
If you haven’t set up a second account, you need to set one up. To do so, 
open the Chart of Accounts by choosing Lists➪Chart of Accounts, or just 
click the Chart of Accounts icon on the Home screen in the Company section. 
Click the Account button and then choose New. Fill in the name of the 
account and, if you want to, the account number or a description of the 
account. Then fill in the As Of box with the date that you opened the account. 
Enter the opening balance as zero so that you can record your initial 
deposit or transfer of money into the account. You record initial deposits 
the way I describe earlier in this chapter (either as simple deposits or as 
customer deposits, whatever the case may be). You record an initial transfer 
by completing the following steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
 
 You see the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, as shown in 
Figure 8-6.
 
2. Select the bank account from which you’re going to transfer the 
money.
 
 From the Transfer Funds From drop-down list at the top of the window, 
choose the account.
 
Figure 8-6: 
The 
Transfer 
Funds 
Between 
Accounts 
window.
 

186
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
3. Select the bank account to which you want to transfer the money.
 
 From the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, select the account that 
receives the funds.
 
4. Enter the amount that you want to transfer and fill in the Memo box.
 
 Someday, you might go into the register for the account that you’re 
writing this check in (a transfer appears just like a check in your 
register) and wonder where you transferred this money and why. Filling 
in the Memo box solves this little mystery beforehand.
 
5. Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button.
 
 QuickBooks records the transfer, which you can confirm by opening your 
Checking register. You see that the transfer has the letters TRANSFR in 
the Type column and the name of the account to which you transferred 
the money in the Account column. The amount that you transferred 
shows up in the Payment column (because you transferred the funds out 
of this account). Figure 8-7 shows a $1,000 transfer — in the figure, the 
selected transaction is the one I’m talking about — from the checking 
account named Big Banking Account to the account named Tiny Trust 
Savings. You can tell that this transaction is a transfer because the other 
account name shows up in the Account box.
 
Figure 8-7: 
A transfer

register.
 

187
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
About the other half of the transfer
Here’s the cool thing about transfer transactions: QuickBooks automatically 
records the other half of the transfer for you. Figure 8-8 shows the other half 
of the transfer from Figure 8-7. This register is for a savings account called 
Tiny Trust Savings. The $1,000 transfer from your checking account actually 
made it into your savings account. The transfer once again shows up as a 
TRANSFR.
 
Figure 8-8: 
The other 
half of the

Changing a transfer that 
you’ve already entered
Big surprise here, but changing a transfer that you already entered works 
just like changing a check. First, you find the transfer in the account register, 
and then you click the Edit Transaction button. You see the Transfer Funds 
Between Accounts window with the transfer check that you wrote. Make 
changes to the check and then click Save & New or Save & Close. You return 
to the register, where your deposit is adjusted accordingly.

188
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
To Delete or to Void?
What happens if you put a transaction — a deposit, a check, or a transfer 
payment — in a Checking register and later decide that it shouldn’t be there? 
You have two ways of handling this situation. If you want to keep a record 
of the transaction but render it moot, meaningless, or nada, you void the 
transaction. But if you want to obliterate the transaction from the face of the 
Earth as though it never happened, you delete it.
Decide whether you want to void or delete the transaction and then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Find the transaction in the register.
 
 In the upcoming section, “The Big Register Phenomenon,” I tell you 
some quick ways to find transactions.
 
2. Choose either Edit➪Delete Check or Edit➪Void Check and then click 
the Record button.
 
 There; the deed is done. Figure 8-9 shows a Checking register window 
with a voided check. The voided transaction is the one selected. Notice 
the word VOID in the Memo column. If this check had been deleted, it 
wouldn’t even show up in the register. An alternative method is to select 
the check in the register or on the check screen and then right-click and 
choose Void Check from there.
 
The Edit menu changes depending on what kind of transaction shows or is 
selected in the open window (that is, Void Deposit, Void Check, and so on).
Handling NSF Checks from Customers
I’ve had a handful of reader questions about how to handle insufficient-funds 
(NSF) check transactions. Here’s how I suggest handling this situation:
 
1. Record the service charge that the bank charges you for handling the 
bounced check, just like any other bank service charge.
 
 You can enter a transaction directly into the register, for example. Or 
you can even record the bank service fee as though it’s a check that you 
just wrote. Anything coming out of your account is entered just like a 
check. (Refer to the earlier discussions in this chapter for information 
on entering transactions in the register or on recording checks.)

189
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
 
Figure 8-9: 
The 
Checking 
register 
shows a 
voided 
check.
 
 
2. Record the adjustment to your bank account balance because the 
customer’s check didn’t clear as a withdrawal or payment.
 
 You can use a bad-debt expense account to categorize the expense of 
the bounced check if you’re on the accrual basis for taxes; otherwise, 
cash-basis companies should directly charge their sales income account 
to reduce their income.
 
3. (Optional) Try to collect on the check again.
 
 Try running by the customer’s bank. You might also try to assess the 
customer a bounced-check fee. (See Chapter 4 for information on 
invoicing customers.) But let’s be honest: You’re probably not going to 
be able to collect, are you? So write a Note in the Customer’s master file 
that says not to take any checks. It will appear right in the middle of the 
Customer Center screen when you select them to record the next sale.
 
4. Post a huge copy of the check in your cash register area so the 
deadbeat customer’s friends and family see the check.
 
 This won’t help you collect, but it might make some new person think 
about writing you a bad check.

190
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
The Big-Register Phenomenon
If you start entering checks, deposits, and transfers into your registers, you 
soon find yourself with registers that contain hundreds, and even thousands, 
of transactions. You can still work with one of these big registers by using 
the tools and techniques that I talk about in the preceding paragraphs. 
Nevertheless, let me give you some more help for dealing with (drum roll, 
please) the big-register phenomenon.
Moving through a big register
You can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to move up and down through 
your register a screen full of transactions at a time. Some people call this 
activity scrolling. You can call it whatever you want.
You can also use the Home key to move through the register. Press the Home 
key once to move to the front of the field you’re currently in. Press the Home 
key twice to move to the first field of the transaction you’re on (the Date 
field), or press it three times to move to the first transaction in the register.
The End key works in a similar fashion. Bet you can guess how this works. 
Press the End key once to move to the end of the field you’re in, press it 
twice to move to the last field of the transaction you’re on (the Memo field), 
or press it three times to move to the last transaction in the register.
Of course, you can use the vertical scroll bar along the right edge of the 
Checking register, too. Click the arrows at either end of the vertical scroll bar 
to select the next or previous transaction. Click either above or below the 
square scroll box to page back and forth through the register. Or, if you have 
no qualms about dragging the mouse around, you can drag the scroll box up 
and down the scroll bar.
 
QuickBooks lets you sort your register in different ways, which makes 
scrolling through and finding transactions much easier. To sort your register 
the way you prefer, choose an option from the Sort By drop-down list in the 
lower-left corner of the Checking register window.
Finding that darn transaction
Want to find that one check, deposit, or transfer? No problem. I discuss this 
technique elsewhere in the book, but it’s appropriate here, too. The Edit 
menus Find command provides a handy way for doing just such a thing. 
Here’s what you do:

191
 Chapter 8: Keeping Your Checkbook
 
1. Choose Edit➪Find and then click the Advanced Find tab.
 
 QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the 
Advanced tab of the Find window (see Figure 8-10). You use this window 
to describe — in as much detail as possible — the transaction that you 
want to find.
 
 Choose the Edit➪Find command to display the Simple tab of the Find 
window. The Simple tab enables you to search for transactions by 
using the transaction type, customer or job name, date, number, and 
amount. You can easily switch to an advanced search by clicking the 
Advanced tab.
 
2. Choose a filter that describes the information that you already have.
 
 In the figure, the Name filter is chosen. When you click different filters, 
the Find window changes.
 
3. Describe the filter that identifies the transaction that you want to 
locate.
 
 In the upper-left box, which is set to Name in Figure 8-10, choose the 
filter that describes the subject of your search from the drop-down list. 
In case of an account-based filter, for example, you can select to look at 
all accounts, just income accounts, just expense accounts, and so on. 
Other filters provide different boxes and boxes for setting the filter.

 By the way, the case of the text doesn’t matter. If you type rainy, for 
example, QuickBooks finds RAINY as well as Rainy.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
 
 Yes, you can filter through as many fields as you want. In fact, you can 
filter so much that nothing matches your specification.
 
5. Click Find to let the search begin.
 
 Click the Find button to begin looking. If QuickBooks finds transactions 
that match the one you described, QuickBooks lists them in the bottom 
half of the window.

In This Chapter
 Setting up and selecting credit card accounts
 Entering credit card charges
 Changing charges that you’ve already entered
 Reconciling credit card statements
 Paying the monthly credit card bill
 Handling debit cards
 Handling customer credit cards
You can use QuickBooks to track your business credit cards in much the 
same way that you use it to keep a checkbook. The process is almost 
the same but with a few wrinkles.
By the way, although this chapter is mostly about you charging money on 
your credit cards, at the end of the chapter I talk about how to handle the 
tricky problem of your customers paying with credit cards.
Tracking Business Credit Cards
If you want to track credit card spending and balances with QuickBooks, you 
need to set up a credit card account — if you didn’t already do so in the 
EasyStep Interview, which you can read about in Chapter 2. (In comparison, 
you use bank accounts to track things such as the money that flows into and 
out of a checking, savings, or petty cash account.)
Setting up a credit card account
To set up a credit card account, you follow roughly the same steps that you 
use to set up a bank account:

194
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
 
 Or click the Chart of Accounts icon on the Home screen. QuickBooks 
displays the Chart of Accounts window, as shown in Figure 9-1.
 
2. Click the Account button in the lower-left corner of the Chart of 
Accounts window and then choose New.
 
 QuickBooks displays the first Add New Account window, which simply 
displays a list of option buttons corresponding to the different types of 
accounts QuickBooks allows.
 
3. Choose Credit Card option button.
 
 Choosing Credit Card tells QuickBooks that you want to set up a credit 
card account. I’m sure that you’re surprised. Click Continue. QuickBooks 
displays the second Add New Account window, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
4. Type a name for the account in the Account Name text box.
 
 Why not do it right? Move the cursor to the Account Name text box and 
then enter the name of your credit card.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The Chart 
of Accounts 
window.

 Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic
 
Figure 9-2: 
The second

5. Type the card number in the Credit Card Acct. No. text box.
 
 If you’re creating a general Credit Card account for more than one 
card, leave the Credit Card Acct. No. text box empty. While you’re at it, 
you can describe the card, too. You might want to type Usury! in the 
Description text box, depending on your card’s interest rate.
 
6. Click the Save & Close button.
 
 QuickBooks redisplays the Chart of Accounts window (refer to Figure 
9-1). Now, the window lists an additional account: the credit card 
account that you just created.
Selecting a credit card account 
so that you can use it
To tell QuickBooks that you want to work with a credit card account, you 
use the Chart of Accounts window — the same window shown in Figure 9-1. 
Go figure! Or you can click the Enter Credit Card Charges icon in the Banking 
area of the Home screen. Or you can also choose Banking➪Enter Credit 
Card Charges.

196
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts. After you display the window, double-click 
the credit card account that you want to use. QuickBooks displays the Credit 
Card register so that you can begin recording transactions.
Entering Credit Card Transactions
After you select a credit card account, QuickBooks displays the Credit Card 
register. Figure 9-3 shows the register for a credit card account I’ve named 
FrequentFlyer. It looks a lot like a Checking register, doesn’t it?
The Credit Card register works like the regular register window that you use 
for a checking account. You enter transactions in the rows of the register. 
When you record a charge, QuickBooks updates the credit card balance and 
the remaining credit limit.

 Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic
Recording a credit card charge
Recording a credit card charge is similar to recording a check or bank 
account withdrawal. For the sake of illustration, suppose that you charged 
$50.00 worth of burritos and margaritas to your favorite Mexican restaurant, 
La Cantina. Here’s how you record this charge:
 
1. Choose Banking ➪Enter Credit Card Charges.
 
 The Enter Credit Card Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
2. From the Credit Card drop-down list, choose the credit card that you 
charged the expense against.
 
 Click the down arrow next to the Credit Card list, and choose a card 
from the drop-down list.
 
3. In the Purchased From field, record the name of the business that you 
paid with a credit card.
 
 Move the cursor to the Purchased From line and click the down arrow. 
You see a list of names. Choose one from the list.
 
 If you’ve never dined at this fine establishment before, choose Add New. 
Then add the business name.

Credit Card 
Charges 
window.

Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
 
4. Select the appropriate radio button to indicate whether the transac-
tion is a purchase or a credit.
 
 Select the Purchase/Charge radio button if you want to record a pur-
chase (which is what you do most of the time and what this example 
shows you). Select the Refund/Credit radio button if you want to record 
a credit on your account (if you returned something, for example).
 
5. Enter the charge date in the Date field.
 
 Move the cursor to the Date line (if the cursor isn’t already there), and 
type the date, using the MM/DD/YYYY format. For example, type either 
11262009 or 11/26/09 for November 26, 2009. If you’re entering this 
charge two or three days after the fact, don’t enter today’s date. Enter 
the date when the charge was made. Using that date makes reconciling 
your records with your credit card company’s records easier when you 
get your monthly statement.
 
6. Type the charge amount in the Amount field.
 
 Move the cursor to the Amount line and enter the total charge 
amount. Don’t type a dollar sign, but do type the period to indicate 
the decimal place.
 
7. (Optional) Enter a memo description in the Memo text box.
 
 Move the cursor to the Memo text box and type the specific reason 
that you’re charging the item. In this case, you could type Important 
Business Meeting or something like that.
 
 Wait. You know what? Let me be more serious. No joking for a minute, 
okay? This memo description box is a good place to document the 
business purpose for a charge, which is a tax law requirement if you’re 
recording a travel, meal, or entertainment business credit card charge.
 
8. Fill in the Expenses tab.
 
 I’m hoping that you read Chapters 6 and 8 so that you know all about 
the Expenses tab — and that you’re thoroughly bored by the topic. 
However, for those of you who opened the book right to this page, you 
use the Expenses tab to record business expenses.
 
 Move to the Account column of the Expenses tab, click the down arrow, 
and choose an Expense account from the list (most likely, Travel & 
Ent:Meals if this were a business lunch). If you enter a name here that 
QuickBooks doesn’t already know, it asks you to set up an expense 
account.
 
 QuickBooks automatically fills in the Amount column when you 
enter a sum in the Amount field. Type something in the Memo column, 
and assign this expense to a Customer:Job and Class if you want to. 
You need to turn on class tracking if you want to assign the expense 
to a class.

199
 Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic
 
9. Fill in the Items tab.
 
 Because this charge is for a meal at a restaurant, you don’t itemize the 
charge. However, if you were charging inventory items such as lumber, 
paper supplies, and so on, you’d fill in the Items tab.
 
 If you have a purchase order (PO) on file with the vendor that you 
entered in the Purchased From line, QuickBooks tells you so. Click 
the Select PO button to see a list of your outstanding purchase orders 
with the vendor. If you don’t know how to handle purchase orders, see 
Chapter 7.
 
10. Record the charge by clicking the Save & New button or the Save & 
Close button.
 
 The charge is recorded in the Credit Card register. Figure 9-5 shows 
what the Credit Card register looks like after I enter a handful of charges.
 
Figure 9-5:

Card

window

Changing charges that you’ve 
already entered
Perhaps you record a credit card charge and then realize that you recorded 
it incorrectly. Or perhaps you shouldn’t have recorded it at all because you 

200
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
didn’t pay for the business lunch. (Someone else paid for it after one of those 
friendly arguments over who should pay the bill. You know the type of argu-
ment I mean: “No, I insist.” “On the contrary, I insist.” You get the picture.)
You have to go into the Credit Card register and either edit or delete the 
charge by following these steps:
 
1. Choose Lists➪Chart of Accounts.
 
 You see the Chart of Accounts window.
 
2. Double-click the credit card account where the faulty charge is.
 
 Like magic, the Credit Card register appears on-screen.
 
3. Select the credit card transaction that you want to delete or change.
 
 That’s easy. Just move the cursor to the transaction.
 
4. Void, delete, or edit the transaction:
 
• To void the credit card transaction, choose Edit➪Void Credit Card 
Charge and then click OK.
 
• To delete the transaction, choose Edit➪Delete Credit Card Charge. 
QuickBooks displays a message box that asks whether you truly 
want to delete the transaction. Click OK.
 
• To edit the transaction, click the Edit Transaction button at the 
top of the window. You return to the Enter Credit Card Charges 
window. Make your changes there and then click Save & New or 
Save & Close. You also can make changes inside the Credit Card 
register and then click Record when you’re done.
Reconciling Your Credit Card Statement 
and Paying the Bill
You reconcile, or balance, a credit card account the same way you balance 
a bank account. (For help with this task, see Chapter 14.) After you suc-
cessfully get the account to balance and click Reconcile Now, QuickBooks 
displays the Make Payment dialog box, asking how you want to pay the bill. 
You can either pay by check or enter a bill to be paid later. (The second 
option is the accounts payable method, remember?)
If you opt to pay the bill by writing a check, you go straight to the Write 
Checks window, and the Expenses tab is all filled out for you. Fill in the name 
of the card issuer, the date, and so on. Click Save & New or Save & Close 
when you’re done. The payment is recorded in both the Checking register 
and the Credit Card register because you charge the credit card liability 
account with the check total.

201
 Chapter 9: Paying with Plastic
If you opt to enter the payment as a bill to be paid at a later date, you go to 
the Enter Bills window. Fill everything out just as you would if you were in 
the Write Checks window. When you click Save & New, the transaction is 
recorded in the Accounts Payable register and the Credit Card register.
See Chapter 6 if you need to know more about either the Enter Bills window 
or the Write Checks window.
So, What about Debit Cards?
Debit cards, when you get right down to it, aren’t credit cards at all. Using 
a debit card is more akin to writing a check than anything else. Rather than 
withdrawing money by writing a check, however, you withdraw money by 
using a debit card.
Although a debit card transaction looks (at least to your friends and the 
merchants you shop with) like a credit card transaction, you should treat a 
debit card transaction like you treat a check. In a nutshell, here’s what you 
need to do:
 
 When you charge something to a debit card, record the transaction just 
like you record a regular check. You may want to enter the transaction 
number as the check number or in the Memo line so that you can keep 
track of the transaction.
 
 When you withdraw cash by using a debit card, record the transaction 
as a regular withdrawal (or transfer to a petty cash account) as if you 
went to the bank with a withdrawal slip.
 
 When you make a deposit through a cash machine by using a debit card, 
record the transaction just like you record a regular deposit.
So, What about Customer Credit Cards?
I want to talk about an awkward subject before you and I close our discus-
sion about how to work with credit cards. Let’s — gulp — talk about how to 
handle customer credit card payments.
Okay, if you don’t already know this, although your customers probably 
love to pay you with credit cards, customer credit cards create a headache 
for you. The reason is that your merchant bank or credit card processor 
aggregates customer credit card charges and then — maybe on a daily 
basis or maybe every few days — deposits a big wad of cash into your bank 
account. The cash represents the sum of the recent credit card charges 
minus a (hopefully modest) fee.

202
Part II: Daily Entry Tasks 
This all sounds innocuous enough, but here’s an example of how this works: 
Customers A, B, and C come in on Monday and spend $5, $10, and $15, 
respectively. Then, on Tuesday, customers D, E, and F come in and spend 
$10, $50, and $30, respectively. On Wednesday, say that you don’t sell 
anything to someone who uses a credit card, but you do see a $105 deposit 
into your bank account from the credit card company.
The problem is that you’re looking at the last two days of credit card transac-
tions, and you know they total $120 because that’s the total you sold to 
customers A, B, C, D, E, and F. So what’s with the $105? Is the missing $15 a 
service fee? Oh, no, wait. Maybe Customer A called his credit card company 
and blocked that first $5 charge — or maybe it was Customer B?
If you accept a credit card, you know how this works, right? It’s a royal 
headache.
I think you probably have two reasonable approaches for dealing with this 
madness:
 
 The Good Accountant’s Way: You can record customer credit card 
payments in the usual way — the way that QuickBooks expects. The 
Good Accountant’s Way produces nice accurate records but at the cost 
of enormous bookkeeping hassles. Interested in more information? 
Great! Use the QuickBooks Help command to search the QuickBooks 
online help for the topic “recording a credit card payment.”
 
 The Bad Accountant’s Way: You can just record sales receipt transac-
tions when the credit card company deposits net charges amounts into 
your bank account. In other words, using the example numbers given in 
an earlier paragraph, rather than recording individual transactions for 
customers A, B, C, D, E, and F when the sales occur, you can record a 
$105 transaction when the credit card company deposits $105 into your 
bank account. If you know the credit card company’s service charge, 
you can record that, too, using a journal entry. (You’ll probably want to 
ask your accountant for help on this.)
I should tell you something. The Bad Accountant’s Way probably isn’t 
justified unless you’re in a high-volume situation — such as a retail store — 
and when you’re using a periodic inventory system or when you don’t sell 
inventory. If you have only a handful of credit card transactions — say, one 
every few days — or you’re trying to use a perpetual inventory system, you 
should use the Good Accountant’s Way.

Part III
Stuff You Do from 
Time to Time

In this part . . .
A
fter you start using QuickBooks, you need to com-
plete some tasks at the end of every week, month, or 
year. This part describes these tasks: printing checks, 
payroll, budgeting, and so on. The list goes on and on. 
Fortunately, QuickBooks comes with some nifty online 
features to help you get the job done.

Chapter 10
Printing Checks
In This Chapter
 Getting your printer ready to print checks
 Printing checks one at a time
 Printing several checks at a time
 Printing a register
T
his chapter covers the reductivity of the postcolonial implications in 
Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Just kidding. It covers how to print 
checks and checking registers.
Printing checks in QuickBooks is quick — well, it’s quick after you set up 
your printer correctly. If you have a continuous-feed printer, you know by 
now that these printers have problems printing anything on a form. The 
alignment always gets messed up.
QuickBooks has check forms that you can buy, and I recommend using them 
if you print checks. After all, the QuickBooks checks were made to work with 
this program. And all banks accept these checks.
 
If you want help with printing reports, check out Chapter 15, where I cover 
this topic in almost too much detail.
Getting the Printer Ready
Before you can start printing checks, you have to make sure that your printer 
is set up to print them. You also have to tell QuickBooks what to put on the 
checks: your company name, address, logo, and so on. And you might try 
running a few sample checks through the wringer to see whether they come 
out all right.

206
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
Follow these steps to set up the printer:
 
1. Choose File➪Printer Setup; then, at the top, click the Form Name 
drop-down arrow and choose Check/Paycheck.
 
 After you choose this command, you see the Printer Setup dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 10-1.
 
2. Choose Check/PayCheck from the Form Name drop-down list.
 
 QuickBooks sets your printing options differently depending on which 
form you want to print. For printing checks, you want to select the 
Check/PayCheck form from the Form Name drop-down list at the top of 
the dialog box.
 
3. From the Printer Name drop-down list, choose your printer.
 
 From the Printer Name drop-down list, click the down arrow and look 
at the printer names. When you installed QuickBooks, it had a frank, 
software-to-software talk with Windows to find out what kind of 
printer(s) you have, among other things. Your printer is probably 
already selected; if it isn’t, choose the correct printer.
 
4. Set the correct Printer Type option, if necessary.
 
 This box is probably already filled in, too, thanks to that frank discus-
sion I mention in Step 3. But if it isn’t, click the down arrow and then 
choose Continuous or Page-Oriented. (The former is generally for 
dot-matrix printers, and the latter for laser and inkjet printers, but it just 
depends on what kind of paper you use for your printer.)
 
5. Select the appropriate Check Style.
 
 Now you’re cooking. This step is where you get to make a real choice:
 
• Voucher checks are the same width as standard checks, but they’re 
much longer. When you select the Voucher option, QuickBooks 
prints voucher information as well: the items and expenses tabula-
tions from the bottom of the Write Checks window. QuickBooks 
also provides information about the checking account that you’re 
writing this check on.
 
• Standard checks are sized to fit in legal envelopes.
 
• The Wallet option is for printing checks that are small enough to fit 
in — you guessed it — a wallet.
 
6. (Optional) Click the Options button and then adjust your printer 
options; when you’re finished, click OK to return to the Printer Setup 
dialog box.
 
 After you click the Options button, QuickBooks displays your printer’s 
Properties dialog box. Use this dialog box to specify print quality, 
number of copies, and other options specific to your printer.
 
7. Click the Fonts tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then the Fonts 
button on that tab to customize the fonts on your checks.

207
 Chapter 10: Printing Checks
 
 When you click either the Font button or the Address Font button on 
this tab, you see the Select Font dialog box (as shown in Figure 10-2) or 
the Select Address Font dialog box. You use the Address Font button to 
designate how your company’s name and address look and the Font 
button to designate what all other print on your checks looks like. Here’s 
your chance to spruce up your checks and make your company’s name 
stand out.
 
 Experiment for a while with the font, font style, and type size settings. 
For example, if you have a bookstore, choose the Bookman font 
(maybe using bold for your company’s name and address); if you run 
a messenger service, choose Courier; Italian mathematicians can use 
Times Roman (just kidding). You can see what your choices look like in 
the Sample box.

Setup 
dialog box.
 
 
Figure 10-2:

dialog box.
 

208
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
8. When you finish fooling around with the fonts, click OK to go back to 
the Printer Setup dialog box.
 
9. Click the Partial Page tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then 
select a Partial Page Printing Style.
 
 Fortunately, some graphics appear; otherwise, you wouldn’t have a 
clue what these options are, would you? These options are for the 
environmentally friendly among you. Suppose that you feed two 
checks to the printer, but the check sheets have three checks each. 
You have a leftover check.
 
 Thanks to this option, you can use the extra check. Select one of the 
options to tell QuickBooks how you plan to feed the check to the 
printer — vertically on the left (the Left option), vertically in the middle 
(the Centered option), or horizontally (the Portrait option). You feed 
checks to the printer the same way that you feed envelopes to it.
 
10. (Optional) Click the Logo button and then enter a company logo or 
some clip art.
 
 In the Logo dialog box, click File, and find the directory and BMP 
(bitmap) graphic file that you want to load. Click OK. Only graphics that 
are in BMP format can be used on your checks, and Intuit recommends 
that the logo be square.
 
11. Click OK when you’re finished.
That setup was no Sunday picnic, was it? But your checks are all ready to be 
printed, and you’ll probably never have to go through that ordeal again.
Printing a Check
For some reason, when I get to this part of the discussion, my pulse quickens. 
Actually writing a check for real money seems terribly serious. I get the same 
feeling whenever I mail someone cash, even if the amount is nominal.
I think that the best way to lower my heart rate (and yours, if you’re like me) 
is to just print the darn check and be done with it. QuickBooks can print 
checks in two ways: as you write them or in bunches.
First things first, however. Before you can print checks, you have to load 
some blank checks into your printer. This process works the same way as 
loading any paper into your printer. If you have questions, refer to your 
printer’s documentation. (Sorry I can’t help more on this process, but a 
million different printers exist, and I can’t tell which one you have, even when 
I look into my crystal ball.)

209
 Chapter 10: Printing Checks
A few words about printing checks
Check printing is kind of complicated, isn’t it? For the record, I’m with you on 
this one. I wish it weren’t so much work, but you’ll find that printing checks 
gets easier after the first few times.
Pretty soon, you’ll be running rather than walking through the steps. Pretty 
soon, you’ll just skate around roadblocks such as check-form alignment 
problems. Pretty soon, in fact, you’ll know all this stuff and never have to 
read pretty soon again.
Printing a check as you write it
If you’re in the Write Checks window and you just finished filling out a check, 
you can print it. The only drawback is that you have to print checks one at a 
time with this method. Here’s how:
 
1. Fill out your check.
 
 Yes, I strongly recommend filling out the check before printing it. And 
make sure that the To Be Printed check box is selected. Turn to Chapter 
6 for help with writing checks with QuickBooks.
 
2. Click the Printer icon in the Write Checks window.
 
 You see the Print Check dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
The Print 
Check 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Enter a check number in the Printed Check Number text box and then 
click OK.
 
 After you click OK, you see the similarly named Print Checks dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 10-4. The settings that you see in this dialog box are 
the ones that you chose when you first told QuickBooks how to print 
checks. If you change the settings in the Print Checks dialog box, the 
changes affect only this particular check. The next time you print a 
check, you’ll see your original settings again.

210
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in 
the dialog box and then click Print.
 
 In the Printer Name text box, specify which printer you want to print to. 
In the Check Style area, indicate whether you want to print a Voucher, 
Standard, or Wallet check.
 
 If you’re printing a partial page of forms on a laser printer, use the 
Partial Page tab to indicate both the number of check forms on the 
partial page and how you’ll feed them through your printer.
 
 If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the check, 
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
 
 See how the Number of Copies text box is grayed out? If you want to 
change this setting, you need to go back to the Printer Setup dialog box. 
(Choose File➪Printer Setup.)
 
 After you click Print, QuickBooks prints the check, and you see the 
Print Checks – Confirmation dialog box (see Figure 10-5). Nothing tricky 
here — just a list of the checks that you just tried to print.
 
Figure 10-4:

Print Checks 
dialog box.
 
 
Figure 10-5:

211
 Chapter 10: Printing Checks
 
5. If the check didn’t print right, click the check listed in the Print 
Checks – Confirmation dialog box to select it and then click OK to 
return to the Write Checks window. Then click the Write Checks 
window Print button again, enter the new check number, and click 
Print again.
 
 QuickBooks doesn’t automatically keep track of incorrectly printed 
check forms, so you have to. If you botch a check form, be sure 
to write VOID in large letters and permanent ink across the face of 
the check. Then file the check away for your reference. Don’t throw the 
check away.
 
 If you still have questions about how to check any mistakes, see the 
later section “What if I make a mistake?”
 
6. If your check looks good, click OK.
 
 You return to the Write Checks window. Don’t forget to sign the check.
Printing checks by the bushel
What if you write a mess of checks and then decide to print them? That’s how 
the process is usually done. Here’s how to print a bushel of checks:
 
1. Go into the Checking register and make sure that the checks that you 
want to print are marked To Print.
 
 The quickest way to get into the Checking register is to choose 
Banking➪Use Register. If you have more than one bank account, select 
the Checking Account register that you want to open and then click OK. 
Do the checks that you want to print have To Print in the Number line? If 
not, tab to the Number line, press T, and then click the Record button. 
QuickBooks automatically fills the Number field with To Print and then 
moves on. (If the check you want to print already has a number, you 
need to replace the number with T.)
 
2. Choose File➪Print Forms➪Checks.
 
 You see the Select Checks to Print dialog box, in which you select the 
checks to print (see Figure 10-6).
 
Figure 10-6: 
The Select 
Checks to 
Print 
dialog box.

Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
3. Click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to print 
and then click OK.
 
 All the checks are selected at first. If you want to print them all, fine. If 
not, click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to 
print so that QuickBooks removes the check marks. Or if you want to 
print only a few of the checks, click the Select None button and then 
click next to the checks that you want to print so that QuickBooks 
places a check mark in the column.
 
 When only the checks that you want to print have check marks, click OK 
to continue with this crazy little thing called check printing. QuickBooks, 
happy with your progress, displays the Print Checks dialog box (refer to 
Figure 10-4). Here, you see the settings that you chose when you first 
told QuickBooks how to print checks.
 
4. Either click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in 
the dialog box and then click Print.
 
 You can change the settings in this dialog box if you want them to 
be different. Any changes that you make for a particular batch of checks 
don’t affect the default settings. The next time you print a check, your 
original settings appear again.
 
 In the Check Style box, indicate whether you want to printVoucher, 
Standard, or Wallet checks. If you’re printing a partial page of checks, 
enter the number of checks on the first page in the Number of Checks on 
First Page text box.
 
 If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the checks, 
select the Print Company Name and Address check box.
 
 Note that the Number of Copies text box is grayed out. If you want to 
change this setting, you need to choose File➪Printer Setup.
 
 QuickBooks prints the checks, and then you see the Print Checks – 
Confirmation dialog box (refer to Figure 10-5).
 
5. Review the checks that QuickBooks printed; then do one of the 
following:
 
• If QuickBooks printed the checks correctly, answer the Did Check(s) 
Print OK? question by clicking OK. (QuickBooks, apparently think-
ing that you now want to do nothing but print checks, redisplays 
the nearly exhausted Write Checks window.)
 
• If QuickBooks didn’t print a check correctly, type the number of the 
first incorrectly printed check in the text box and then click OK. In 
this case, repeat the steps for check printing. Note, though, that 
you need to reprint only the first bad check and the checks that 
follow it. You don’t need to reprint good checks that precede the 
first bad check.

213
 Chapter 10: Printing Checks
 
 Don’t forget to write VOID in large letters and permanent ink 
across the front of incorrectly printed check forms. Then file the 
checks for safekeeping. (Don’t throw them away.) To record the 
voided check in QuickBooks, see the next section, “What if I make 
a mistake?”
 
 If the numbers of the checks that you need to reprint aren’t sequential 
and are, in fact, spread all over creation, make it easy on yourself. Click 
OK to clear the list of checks to be printed, go into the Checking register, 
click the Number line of the checks that you need to print, and then 
press T. QuickBooks automatically fills these with To Print. Then choose 
File➪Print Forms➪Checks, as in Step 2, and continue from there.
 
 If your checks came out all right, take the rest of the day off. Give 
yourself a raise while you’re at it.
 
6. Sign the printed checks.
 
 Then — and I guess you probably don’t need my help here — put the 
checks in the mail.
What if you make a mistake?
If you discover a mistake after you print a check, the problem may not be as 
big as you think.
If you already mailed the check, however, you can’t do much. You can try to 
get the check back (if the person you paid hasn’t cashed it already) and 
replace it with a check that’s correct. (Good luck on this one.)
If the person cashed the check, you can’t get the check back. If you 
overpaid the person by writing the check for more than you should have, 
you need to get the person to pay you the overpayment amount. If you 
underpaid the person, you need to write another check for the amount of the 
underpayment.
If you printed the check but haven’t mailed it, void the printed check. This 
operation has two parts. First, write VOID in large letters across the face 
of the check form. (Use a ballpoint pen if you’re using multipart forms so 
that the second and third parts also show as VOID.) Second, display the 
Checking register, highlight the check, and then choose Edit➪Void Check. 
(This option marks the check as one that has been voided in the system so 
that QuickBooks doesn’t use the check in calculating the account balance.) 
If you’re voiding an incorrectly printed check, you first need to create a 
transaction for the check number that printed incorrectly and then void that 
transaction.
Of course, if you want to reissue a voided check, just enter the check all over 
again — only this time, try to be more careful.

214
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
If you notice only after clicking OK in the Print Checks – Confirmation dialog 
box that a check printed incorrectly, you can tell QuickBooks you want 
to reprint the check in one of two ways. If you have the register window 
displayed, you can change the check’s number from 007, for example, to To 
Print. If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can select the 
To Be Printed check box.
Where, oh where, do unprinted checks go?
Unprinted checks — those that you entered by using the Write Checks 
window but haven’t yet printed — are stored in the Checking register. To 
identify them as unprinted checks, QuickBooks puts To Print in the Number 
line. What’s more, when you tell QuickBooks to print the unprinted checks, 
what it really does is print the checks in the register that have To Print in the 
Number line. All this knowledge is of little practical value in most instances, 
but it results in several interesting possibilities.
For example, you can enter the checks that you want to print directly into the 
register; all you need to do is type To Print in the Number line.
Printing a Checking Register
You can print a Checking register, or a register for any other account, too. 
Follow these steps to print a register:
A big, bad warning concerning check voiding
In general, you shouldn’t void checks from a 
previous year. (You would do this by clicking the 
check and then choosing Edit➪Void Check.) If 
you do, you’ll adjust the previous year’s 
expenses, which sounds okay, but you don’t 
want to do this because (a) it means that you 
can no longer prepare income statements and 
balance sheets that correspond to your finan-
cial statements and tax returns, and (b) you’ve 
already presumably included the check in your 
deductions for the previous year. If you do 
have a check that should be voided — say, it’s 
outstanding and has never been cashed or was 
a mistake in the first place — record a journal 
entry in the current year that undoes the effect 
of the check. Normally, the entry is a Debit to 
the Checking account and a Credit to the 
Miscellaneous Income account in the current 
year for the amount of the check if it was 
expensed in a prior tax year. If it was for some-
thing other than an expense, just reverse the 
check to the same account it was originally 
charged.

215
 Chapter 10: Printing Checks
 
1. Open the account register you want to print.
 
 Choose Banking➪Use Register, or click the Check Register icon on the 
Home screen and then click the Print icon. If you have more than one 
bank account, choose the account register you want to print from the 
drop-down list and then click OK.
 
2. Choose File➪Print Register.
 
 You see the Print Register dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-7. This 
option is available whenever you have a register open for an account.
 
3. Fill in the Date Range text boxes.
 
 To print a register of something other than the current year-to-date 
transactions, use the From and Through text boxes. This step is pretty 
darn obvious, isn’t it? You just move the cursor to the From and 
Through text boxes and type the range of months that the register 
should include.
 
4. If you want, select the Print Splits Detail check box.
 
 As you know, a register doesn’t show all the messy details, such as the 
Items and Expenses tab information, but you can select this check box 
to include all this stuff on your printed register.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 You see the Print Lists dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-8.
 
6. If everything is cool, click the Print button and skip the remaining 
steps. If you want to change options in the Print Lists dialog box, 
proceed to the next step.
 
 You don’t have to fool around with the Print Lists dialog box. If you 
want to print a register pronto, just click Print, and QuickBooks sends 
the register on its merry way to your printer. Then again, if you’re the 
sort of person who likes to fool around with this kind of stuff, carry on 
with the rest of these steps.
 
 If you want to see the effect that the different settings in this dialog box 
have, just experiment. You can’t hurt anything or anybody.
 
7. (Optional) Print the report to disk.
 
 To print the report to disk as a text file, select the File radio button, and 
then choose one of the following Print To options:
 
• Choose ASCII Text File if you want to create a text file (for example, 
when you want to import the register into a word processing 
program).
 
• Choose Comma Delimited File to import the register into Microsoft 
Excel or Lotus 1-2-3.
 
• Choose Tab Delimited File to, for example, import the register into 
a database program like Access. (Oooh, fancy.)

8. Choose the paper orientation.
 
 In which direction do you want the report to be printed: Portrait 
(regular) or Landscape (sideways)? Just select the appropriate 
radio button.
 
9. (Optional) Tell QuickBooks which pages to print.
 
 Use the Print Range radio buttons and text boxes to limit the pages for 
QuickBooks to print.
 
10. (Optional) Color your world; print your report in color.
 
 If you have a color printer and want to print the register in color, select 
the Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box.
 
11. (Optional) Preview the report.
 
 To see how your settings will affect the report before you actually 
print it, click Preview. QuickBooks shows you the results on-screen. 
This feature has probably saved more trees than you can imagine.
 
12. Click Print.
 
 After you have the report exactly the way you want it (and not one 
moment before!), click Print, and QuickBooks finally prints the register.

P
ayroll is one of the major headaches of running a small business. When I 
think of all the time that I’ve seen clients waste figuring out withholding 
amounts, writing checks, and trying to fill out comically confusing payroll tax 
returns, it just makes me want to scream. Fortunately, QuickBooks helps. And 
in a big way. In this chapter, I explain how.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll without 
Help from QuickBooks
However, before I launch into a discussion of doing payroll using 
QuickBooks, I want to share an accounting thought that’s almost heretical. 
You may not want to do payroll yourself using QuickBooks. No, wait — 
hear me out.
The easiest way to do payroll, quite frankly, is to sign up with an outside 
service bureau, such as ADP or Paychex. If you have an accountant, 
you might also want to ask him or her about other less-expensive, local 
payroll services.
Of course, the easiest route is often the most expensive, and payroll services 
are no exception. In my experience, these full-meal-deal services tend to 
run about twice the price of the most expensive QuickBooks Payroll service 

218
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
after you add everything up, but all you need to do is make a phone call. 
(Check your telephone book for a local number.) The payroll service will 
send someone nice out to your office. A few days later, all you need to do is 
make a phone call or send a fax when you want to pay employees.
Doing Taxes the Right Way
And one thing I need to mention: Even before you set up QuickBooks for 
payroll, you need a few other items if you want to do payroll the right way. 
(If you want to do payroll the wrong way, you’re reading the wrong book.)
 
 A federal employer identification (ID) number
 
 A state employer ID number (if you withhold state income taxes)
 
 An unemployment tax ID number
 
 W-4 tax forms
Getting an employer ID number
To get an employer ID number, you need to file an SS-4, Application for 
Employer Identification Number form, with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS). You can get this form at the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) or by calling 
the IRS and asking for one.
You can also apply for and receive an employer identification number over 
the telephone. You still need to fill out the SS-4 form before you call, how-
ever, so that you can answer the questions that the IRS asks during the short 
telephone application process. (You also need to mail or fax the form to the 
IRS after you have your little telephone conversation.)
Or, even easier, you can just do it all online. Here’s the current URL:
https://sa1.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp
Having employees do their part
You also need to do something else before you can know how to handle all 
those taxes: You need to have your employees fill out W-4 forms to tell you 
what filing status they’ll use and how many personal exemptions they’ll 
claim. Guess where you get blank W-4s? From your friendly IRS agent or the 
IRS Web site (www.irs.gov) in the Forms & Publications area.

 Chapter 11: Payroll
Getting Ready to Do Payroll 
with QuickBooks
If you want to use one of the QuickBooks Payroll service options because you 
want to save money, you aren’t scared of a little paperwork, or maybe you 
want the extra flexibility that comes with doing it yourself, you need to sign 
up for the appropriate flavor of service.
Costs of the QuickBooks Payroll services vary based on the number of 
employees you have and on how much work you want the nice folks at 
QuickBooks to do. Figure on spending at least $100 to $200 per year for 
the most basic package. And note that if you want the full-meal-deal, you’re 
looking at a current cost of between $700 and $800 per year. (In addition, 
if history is any guide, you will need to more regularly upgrade your 
QuickBooks software.) To set up for a payroll service option, get ready to 
hop on the Internet. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Employees➪Payroll➪My Payroll Service.
 
 QuickBooks connects to the Internet and displays the first page of 
a multiple-page Web form that enables you to sign and set up the 
QuickBooks Payroll service.
 
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.
 
 I don’t repeat the on-screen instructions for setting up the payroll ser-
vice. Providing that kind of information would be . . . well, extremely 
redundant. Just carefully follow the instructions, and you’ll have no 
trouble.
 
 Note: Setting up the QuickBooks Payroll service requires that you 
have accurate year-to-date payroll information for all your employees 
as well as state withholding rate information. You’ll want to collect all 
this information before you begin. The process of setting up payroll — 
assuming that you have the information at hand and that you have only 
a handful of employees — shouldn’t take much more than half an hour.
 
3. Schedule your payroll.
 
 After you sign up for (and indirectly set up) the QuickBooks Payroll 
service, you need to schedule your upcoming payroll activities. To do 
this, choose the Employees ➪Add or Edit Payroll Schedules command. 
When QuickBooks displays the Payroll Schedule List window, click the 
Payroll Schedule button and then New. When prompted by QuickBooks, 
describe the payroll you’re scheduling. For example, if you’re setting 
up a weekly payroll, name the payroll something like Friday payroll. 
Furthermore, describe the frequency as weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, 
and so on.

220
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
4. Describe your employees.
 
 You need to describe each of your employees, and you also need to 
identify which payroll schedule they belong to. To do this, choose 
Employees➪Employee Center. Click the New Employee button. Then, 
use the tabs of the window that QuickBooks displays to provide the 
employee’s name, address, Social Security number, and so on. Note that 
you use the Payroll and Compensation tab to specify the employee’s 
wage or salary and to assign the employee to a scheduled payroll.
Paying Your Employees
After you subscribe to the QuickBooks Payroll service and set up your 
payroll schedule, you’re ready to pay someone. This section is going to blow 
your mind, especially if you’ve been doing payroll manually. The process 
makes your whole decision to use QuickBooks to do your payroll worthwhile. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Start the payroll process by choosing Employees➪Pay Employees➪
Scheduled Payroll.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Employee Center: Payroll Center window 
(see Figure 11-1). The Payroll Center window identifies any payroll 
schedules you set up. (The Payroll Center window also shows any 
payroll tax liabilities that you accrued because of past payroll activity) 
Select the scheduled payroll you want to, well, “do.” Then click the Start 
Scheduled Payroll button. QuickBooks displays Enter Payroll Income 
window, which lists the employees who participate in the scheduled 
payroll. Initially, all the listed employees have a check mark beside their 
name, but you can click to remove the check mark and to remove the 
employee from the scheduled payroll.
 
2. Create the paychecks.
 
 When the Enter Payroll Income window correctly lists which employees 
should be paid, click Continue. QuickBooks calculates employee gross 
wages, deductions, and net wages; and shows its calculations from the 
Review and Create Paychecks window
 
3. (Optional) Review a payroll check.
 
 You can preview any employee’s payroll data by clicking his or her 
name on the Review and Create Paychecks window. When you click an 
employee’s name, QuickBooks displays the Preview Paycheck window 
for the employee.
 
 The main thing to pay attention to in the Preview Paycheck window is 
the Earnings text box. It shows what QuickBooks assumes you’ll pay an 
employee. In the Earnings text box, you fill in the number of hours the 
person worked and apply these hours to a customer or job, if necessary.

221
 Chapter 11: Payroll
 
 The Preview Paycheck window also includes an Other Payroll Items 
input area. In the Other Payroll Items text box, you enter commissions; 
additions, such as tips, bonuses, and expense reimbursements; deduc-
tions, such as union dues and 401(k) contributions; and company 
contributions, such as insurance benefits and 401(k) matching amounts. 
You also can change the payroll item or rate or add another payroll 
item, if you need to.
 
 Watch out for this: QuickBooks calculates the company taxes, the 
employee taxes, and the amount of the net check; this information 
appears in the Employee Summary area and the Company Summary area 
of the Preview Paycheck window. If some information is inaccurate, click 
the amount and change it, either by deleting it or replacing it with the 
correct information.
 
 You might also note that QuickBooks keeps totals for both the current 
check and the year to date.
 
4. Print the payroll checks.
 
 When you’re ready to print the payroll checks, click the Create 
Paychecks button. QuickBooks lets you either print payroll checks from 
QuickBooks or print paycheck stubs (which means that you would then 
later handwrite payroll checks). If you direct QuickBooks to print the 
checks, you print the payroll checks in the same way as you print other, 
nonpayroll checks. (Got a question about printing checks? See Chapter 
10.) If you want to print paycheck stubs and will later handwrite payroll 
checks, give QuickBooks the first check number so it knows how to 
number the checks that it records into your check register.

222
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
Paying Payroll Liabilities
Make no mistake: Big Brother wants the money that you withhold from an 
employee’s payroll check for federal income taxes, Social Security, and 
Medicare. Big Brother also wants the payroll taxes you owe: the matching 
Social Security and Medicare taxes, federal unemployment taxes, and so on. 
So every so often, you need to pay Big Brother the amounts that you owe.
If you withhold money from employees’ checks for other reasons (perhaps 
for health insurance or retirement savings), these amounts are payroll 
liabilities that need to be paid to the appropriate parties.
Paying tax liabilities if you use the 
full-meal-deal Payroll service
Fortunately, if you’re using the QuickBooks full-meal-deal Payroll service — 
this is the most expensive payroll option QuickBooks provides — your 
federal tax liabilities and most (perhaps all) of your state tax liabilities are 
paid as part of the service. In other words, Intuit withdraws money from your 
bank account and uses this money to pay the appropriate federal or state 
government agency.
 
Be sure to check which state payroll taxes QuickBooks calculates and pays. 
In Washington state, which is where my business is located, QuickBooks won’t 
calculate a couple of state payroll taxes, so I have to calculate these myself 
(on the state payroll tax form) and pay them with a check.
Paying tax liabilities if you don’t use 
the full-meal-deal Payroll service
If you’re aren’t using the full-meal-deal payroll service, you need to pay 
the payroll liabilities yourself. To do this, choose Employees➪Payroll Taxes 
and Liabilities➪Pay Scheduled Liabilities. When QuickBooks displays the 
Employee Center: Payroll Center window (and its list of scheduled payrolls 
and the associated liabilities), choose the payroll liability you want to pay 
and then choose the View/Pay button.
QuickBooks writes the check and puts it in your register. QuickBooks 
also gives the check the appropriate date and schedules it to pop up in 
your Reminders window at the right time. Also, if you are enrolled in the 

223
 Chapter 11: Payroll
Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) system online, the 
check is created the same way, and the check number can be changed to 
EFTPS and not actually printed. (Keep reading for more on EFTPS.)
 
When do you make payroll tax deposits? That’s a question that frequently 
comes up. The general rule about U.S. federal tax deposits is this: If your accu-
mulated payroll taxes are less than $2,500 for the quarter, you can just pay 
those taxes with your quarterly 941 return. This law is called the de minimis 
rule. (My understanding is that the law was named after Congresswoman Dee 
Minimis.) If you owe more than $2,500, other special rules come into play that 
determine whether you pay deposits monthly, semimonthly, weekly, or even 
immediately. The IRS tells you, by the way, how often you’re supposed to 
make payments.
If you owe a large amount of money, you’re required to deposit it almost 
immediately. For example, if you owe $100,000 or more, you need to make the 
payroll tax deposit by the next banking day. Some nuances apply to these 
rules, so unless you don’t owe very much (and, therefore, can fall back on the 
de minimis rule), you might want to consult a tax advisor (or call the IRS).
 
The general rule when writing payroll checks is to make the last checks that 
you write the ones that pay your federal and state tax deposits when they 
come due. You’ll never get into late-payment trouble if you follow this 
approach. It will also make your life a lot easier when it comes time to fill 
out Schedule B of Form 941, if you have to do so.
 
To make a payroll tax deposit, just deliver your check with an 8109 federal tax 
deposit coupon to a financial institution that’s qualified as a depository for 
federal taxes or to the Federal Reserve Bank that serves your geographical 
area. The IRS should have already sent you a book of coupons as a result of 
your asking for an employer ID number. And one other thing: Make your check 
payable to the depository or to the Federal Reserve Bank. Note, too, that the 
U.S. Treasury makes it very easy to make payroll tax deposits electronically by 
using the EFTPS. (The Treasury will send you information on this when you 
start making deposits, so keep your eyes peeled for this easy way to save 
yourself some time.) You can visit the www.eftps.gov Web site for more 
information.
Paying other nontax liabilities
If you’re paying nontax liabilities for things such as employee health insur-
ance or retirement savings — it doesn’t matter whether you’re using the 
cheapo payroll service or the full-meal-deal payroll service — you also use 
the Employees➪Payroll Taxes and Liabilities➪Create Custom Liability 
Payment command. (When you choose the command, you’ll need to indicate 
which liabilities you want to pay.)

224
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
You need to pay all your payroll liabilities via the Employees➪Payroll Taxes 
And Liabilities➪Create Custom Liability Payment command if you want 
QuickBooks to keep your payroll liabilities straight. I mention this because 
people commonly just pay these liabilities by using the Write Checks window. 
That creates a mess.
Preparing Quarterly Payroll Tax Returns
At the end of every quarter, you need to file a quarterly payroll tax return. 
(By quarters here, I’m referring to calendar quarters.) If you’re a business 
owner, for example, you must file a Form 941, which states how much you 
paid in gross wages, how much you withheld in federal taxes, and how much 
you owe for employer payroll taxes for the quarter.
You’ll find that QuickBooks makes filling out these forms darn simple.
 
If you have household employees, such as a nanny, you must file a Form 942. 
Again, you fill out Form 942 to say how much you paid in gross wages, 
withheld in federal taxes, and owe in payroll taxes. Unfortunately, QuickBooks 
doesn’t do a 942 for you. Apparently, it thinks you don’t need domestic help.
Using the QuickBooks full-meal-deal 
Payroll service
If you’re using the top-of-the-line QuickBooks Payroll service, the service fills 
out and sends the quarterly payroll tax forms for you.
Using the other QuickBooks 
Payroll services
If you’re using one of the other Payroll services — again, by this, I mean a 
payroll service other than the full-meal-deal service — you need to fill out 
and send the payroll tax forms, but don’t worry — QuickBooks prepares the 
941 for you. If you need to fill out the 942 or a state payroll tax form, 
QuickBooks can also be of great help. All you really need to know for these 
other forms is what the gross-wages totals are.

225
 Chapter 11: Payroll
To get the gross-wages totals and the balances in each of the payroll tax 
liability accounts at the end of the quarter, print the Payroll Summary report. 
Choose Reports➪Employees & Payroll➪Payroll Summary. QuickBooks 
displays the Payroll Summary report. Specify the range of dates as the 
quarter for which you’re preparing a quarterly report. Scroll across to the 
Total column, which shows the gross wages upon which your employer 
payroll taxes are calculated.
 
The withholding account amounts are the amounts that you recorded to date 
for the employee’s federal income taxes withheld and the employee’s Social 
Security and Medicare taxes, so QuickBooks needs to double these figures to 
get the actual Social Security and Medicare taxes owed. Choose Reports➪
Employees & Payroll➪Payroll Liability Balances. QuickBooks creates a report 
that tallies these amounts.
QuickBooks will create and print out a copy of Form 941 for you, so you 
don’t have to get out your calculator or mess around with lining up the red 
form in your typewriter. Just choose Employees➪Payroll Forms➪Process 
Payroll Forms. QuickBooks runs you through a wizard that asks you for your 
state and the number of employees that you had over the quarter. Then 
QuickBooks summarizes each line of the form. When QuickBooks is done, all 
you have to do is print out the form.
 
If your accountant fills out the 941 or 942 Form for you, you don’t need 
to read this section of this chapter. Your accountant won’t have any problem 
completing the quarterly payroll tax return by using the QuickBooks Payroll 
report, and in fact — I kid you not — your accountant will probably even 
enjoy doing it.
Filing Annual Returns 
and Wage Statements
At the end of the year, you need to file some annual returns — such as the 
940 Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return — and the W-2 and W-3 wages 
statements.
 
You need to prepare any state unemployment annual summary before 
you prepare the 940 because the 940 requires information from the 
state returns.

226
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
Using the QuickBooks full-meal-deal 
Payroll service
If you’re using the full-meal-deal Payroll service, the service automatically 
fills out and sends these forms for you.
Using the QuickBooks economy 
Payroll services
If you’re using one of the economy payroll service options, you need to fill 
out and send these forms in-house, but you get lots of help from QuickBooks. 
QuickBooks creates and prints the 940 and W-2s/W-3s for you. All you have to 
do is choose Employees➪Payroll Forms➪Process Payroll Forms. QuickBooks 
asks you for a little information, and then it does the calculating for you. 
Just check the QuickBooks records against your own, and if everything 
matches, print that puppy out. To look over the QuickBooks data included 
in the form and verify its integrity, it helps to print an Employee Earnings 
Summary report.
 
If you have a little trouble, call the IRS. If you have a great deal of trouble, 
splurge and have someone else fill out the forms for you. Filling out these 
forms doesn’t take a rocket scientist, by the way. Any experienced bookkeeper 
can do it for you.
Please don’t construe my “rocket scientist” comment as personal criticism if 
this payroll-taxes business seems terribly complicated. My experience is that 
some people — and you may very well be one of them — just don’t have an 
interest in things such as payroll accounting. If, on the other hand, you’re a 
“numbers are my friend” kind of person, you’ll have no trouble at all after you 
learn the ropes.
The State Wants Some Money, Too
Yeah. I haven’t talked about state payroll taxes — at least not in great detail. 
I wish that I could provide this sort of detailed, state-specific help to you. 
Unfortunately, doing so would make this chapter about 150 pages long. It 
would also cause me to go stark raving mad.

227
 Chapter 11: Payroll
My sanity and laziness aside, you still need to deal with state payroll taxes. 
Let me say, however, that you apply the same basic mechanics to state 
payroll taxes that you apply to federal payroll taxes. For example, a state 
income tax works the same way as the federal income tax; employer-paid 
state unemployment taxes work like the employer-paid federal taxes; and 
employee-paid state taxes work like the employee-paid Social Security 
and Medicare taxes.
If you’re tuned in to how federal payroll taxes work in QuickBooks, you 
shouldn’t have a problem with the state payroll taxes — at least not in terms 
of mechanics. Also, note that the 2009 version of QuickBooks can now print 
most state forms for most states. Check the www.quickbooks.com Web site 
for more information about this topic.
 
The one thing you need to figure out is what your state wants. To do that, you 
need to get the state’s payroll tax reporting instructions. You may need to call 
the state. Or, with a little luck, you may find online instructions at your state 
government’s Web site. If that isn’t much help, you can probably look up the 
state tax people’s telephone number in your local phone book.

In This Chapter
 Checking out powerful tips for business budgets
 Setting up a budget
 Reviewing QuickBooks Planning & Budgeting tools
I
don’t think that a budget amounts to financial handcuffs, and neither 
should you. A budget is just a plan that outlines how you intend to 
generate sales, how you should spend your money, and your ideas about 
how you can best organize your firm’s financial affairs.
Is This a Game You Want to Play?
If you created a good, workable Chart of Accounts, you’re halfway to a good, 
solid budget. (In fact, for 99 out of 100 businesses, the only step left is to 
specify how much you earn in each income account and how much you 
spend in each expense account.)
Does every business need a budget? No, of course not. Maybe you have a 
simple financial plan that you can monitor some other way. Maybe in your 
business, you make money so effortlessly that you don’t need to plan 
your income and outgo. Maybe Elvis Presley really is still alive and living 
somewhere in the Midwest.
For everyone else, though, a budget improves your chances of getting your 
business wherever you want it to go financially. It gives you a way to “plan 
your work and work your plan.” In fact, I’ll stop calling it a budget. The word 
has such negative connotations. I know — I’ll call it The Secret Plan.

230
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
All Joking Aside: Some 
Basic Budgeting Tips
Before I walk you through the mechanics of outlining your Secret Plan, I 
want to give you a few tips. After that, I want to tell you a secret. A very 
special secret.
 
Here are five ways to increase the chances that your Secret Plan works:
 
 Plan your income and expenses as a team, if that’s possible. For this 
sort of planning, two heads are invariably better than one. What’s more, 
although I don’t want to get into marriage counseling or partnership 
counseling here, the budget of a business — oops, I mean its Secret 
Plan — needs to reflect the priorities and feelings of everyone who has 
to live within the plan: partners, partners’ spouses, key employees, and 
so on. So don’t use a Secret Plan as a way to minimize what your partner 
spends on marketing or on long-distance telephone charges talking to 
pseudo-customers and relatives in the old country. You need to resolve 
such issues before you finalize your Secret Plan.
 
 Include some cushion in your plan. In other words, don’t budget to 
spend every last dollar. If you plan from the start to spend every dollar 
you make, you’ll undoubtedly have to fight the mother of all financial 
battles: paying for unexpected expenses when you don’t have any 
money. (You know the sort of things I mean: the repair bill when the 
delivery truck breaks down, a new piece of essential equipment, or that 
cocktail dress or tuxedo you absolutely must have for a special party.)
 
 Regularly compare your actual income and outgo with your planned 
income and outgo. This comparison is probably the most important 
part of budgeting, and it’s what QuickBooks can help you with the most. 
As long as you use QuickBooks to record what you receive and spend 
and to describe your budget, you can print reports that show what you 
planned and what actually occurred.
 
 If you find that you’ve budgeted $1,000 per month for shipping costs, but 
you discover that you consistently spend twice that amount, you may 
need to shift some money from your monthly cocktail dress-and-tuxedo 
allowance . . . unless you like coming in over budget on shipping 
charges.
 
 Make adjustments as necessary. When you encounter problems with 
your Secret Plan — and you will — you’ll know that part of your plan 
isn’t working. Then you can make adjustments (by spending a little less 
on calling the old country, for example).

231
 Chapter 12: Building the Perfect Budget
 
 A word to the wise: Don’t gear up your business overhead or your 
personal living and lifestyle when you have a great year (or even a 
few great years) in the business. When you have a good year or even a 
few good years, keep your overhead and expenses modest. Stash the 
extra cash. If you can, build up some financial wealth that’s independent 
and apart from your business assets. (One great way to do this, for 
example, is by contributing to an IRA or by setting up a Simple-IRA or a 
SEP/IRA for yourself and any employees.)
A Budgeting Secret You 
Won’t Learn in College
I also have a secret tip for you. (I’m going to write very quietly now so that no 
one else hears. . . .)
 
Here’s the secret tip: Go to the library, and ask for the Robert Morris & 
Associates Survey, the Risk Management Association (or RMA) Reference, the 
Dun & Bradstreet Annual Financial Statement Survey, and any similar references 
of business financial statistics. After you get these books, find a nice, quiet 
corner of the library, and look up how other businesses like yours (that is, 
businesses that are the same size, sell the same stuff or services, and have 
the same gross and net profits) spend money.
These references are cool. For example, Robert Morris & Associates surveys 
bank lending officers, creates a summary of the information that these 
bankers receive from their customers, and publishes the results. You can 
look up, for example, what percentage of sales the average tavern spends on 
beer and peanuts.
Plan to spend an hour or so at the library. Getting used to the way that the 
Robert Morris & Associates report, for example, displays information takes a 
while. The taverns page doesn’t actually have a line for beer and peanuts, for 
example. Instead, you see some vague accounting term like cost of goods sold.
 
Make a few notes so that you can use the information you glean to better plan 
your own business financial affairs. If you spend about the same amount on 
beer and peanuts every year as the average tavern, you’re in good shape — 
well, unless you own a shoe store.
The point is that you can and should use this information to get a better 
handle on what businesses like yours earn and spend.

232
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
A final, tangential point: Have you ever heard businesspeople talk about bench-
marking? The idea is that to compete in a market, you need to do at least as 
well as your competitors or similar firms in other markets. And one way to 
assess how you’re doing compared with competitors is to compare financial 
ratios, or benchmarks. For example, if you compare what you spend as a 
percentage of revenue on advertising with what similar firms spend, you can 
often glean real insights into what you should do to better your business. 
You’ll discover, for example, where you’re spending too much and where 
you’re spending too little. You’ll also sometimes see competitive advantages 
that you possess of which you were not aware earlier.
Setting Up a Secret Plan
Okay, enough background stuff. The time has come to set up your budget — 
er, your Secret Plan — in QuickBooks. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets.
 
 If you haven’t yet set up a budget, QuickBooks displays the Create New 
Budget window, as shown in Figure 12-1. If you already set up a budget, 
another window appears, and you need to click the Create New Budget 
button to get to the Create New Budget window.
 
2. Select the year that you want to budget.
 
 Use the box to specify the fiscal year. You use the arrows at the end of 
the box to adjust the year number incrementally.
 
3. Select the type of budget that you want to create.
 
 See those two option buttons on the Create New Budget window? They 
let you tell QuickBooks whether you want to create a budget of income 
and expense amounts (done with a pro forma profit and loss statement) 
or a budget of year-end asset, liability, and owner’s equity account 
balances (done with a pro forma balance sheet). Typically, you want to 
budget income and expense amounts.
 
 After you indicate for what year you want to budget and whether you 
want to budget income statement amounts or balance sheet amounts, 
click Next.
 
4. Provide any additional budgeting criteria and instructions.
 
 QuickBooks asks next whether you want to budget using additional 
criteria, such as Customer:Job information or class information. You 
answer this question by marking the option button that corresponds 
to budgeting criteria you want and then clicking Next. (If you’re just 
starting out, don’t worry about specifying additional criteria. Keep 
things simple to start.)

233
 Chapter 12: Building the Perfect Budget
 
5. Indicate whether you want to start from scratch; then click Next.
 
 QuickBooks asks whether you want it to create a first cut at your 
budget by using last year’s numbers or whether you just want to start 
from scratch. To answer this question, mark the option button that 
corresponds to your choice. For example, to budget from scratch, select 
the Create Budget from Scratch radio button.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window (see Figure 12-2).
 
6. Do your budget.
 
 You use the Set Up Budgets window to identify the budgeted amounts 
that you plan for each account. Just click the monthly amount you want 
to budget and enter a value. If you said that you want to budget from 
scratch, by the way, QuickBooks shows a window with a bunch of empty 
columns (like the window in Figure 12-2). If you said that you want to 
base the coming year’s budget on last year’s real numbers, you see 
numbers in the columns.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Create 
New Budget 
window.
 
 
Figure 12-2: 
The Set Up 
Budgets 
window.
 

234
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
 If your Set Up Budgets window is too big for the monitor, QuickBooks 
shows only a few months of budgeted data at a time. Then you need 
to click the Show Next 6 Months button to move to the next part of 
the budget year. To move back to the first part of the year, click the 
Show Prev 6 Months button. (Only one of these Show buttons appears 
at a time.)
 
 The Budget drop-down list, at the top-left corner of the Set Up Budgets 
window, lets you select the budget you want to work with. You can work 
with several different versions of your budget. (To create a new budget, 
click the Create New Budget button, which steps you through the 
process described previously.)
 
 To copy the amount shown in the selected box across the row, click the 
Copy Across button. (This lets you copy, for example, some amount you 
budgeted for January into February, March, April, May, and so on.)
 
 If you want to be a little fancier, you can also select some budgeted 
amount and click the Adjust Row Amounts button. QuickBooks displays 
the Adjust Row Amounts dialog box (see Figure 12-3), which lets you 
adjust the selected amount by some specified percentage increase or 
decrease. If you want to increase the budgeted amount by, say, 25% per 
month, you use the Adjust Row Amounts window.
 
7. Save your budgeting work.
 
 After you enter your Secret Plan, click Save to save your work and leave 
the Set Up Budgets window open. Or, click OK to save your work but 
close the Set Up Budgets window.
 
 I should mention, too, that you can just click Cancel if you don’t want to 
save your work (in case you’ve just been noodling around).

The Adjust 
Row 
Amounts 
dialog box.
 
Adjusting a Secret Plan
To later make additional changes to a budget, choose Company➪Planning & 
Budgeting➪Set Up Budgets. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window. 
Select the budget that you want to work with from the Budget drop-down 

235
 Chapter 12: Building the Perfect Budget
list and then make your changes. All the same tools that you had for initially 
setting up your forecast (which I describe in the preceding section) are 
available for editing your budget.
Forecasting Profits and Losses
QuickBooks can also prepare a forecast of a year’s profits (or losses) by 
forecasting what your income statement will look like based either on 
the previous year’s income and expenses or by using actual numbers that 
you enter very similar to how you budget. (See the preceding section’s 
description of how to create a budget.)
To tell QuickBooks to forecast profits and losses, choose Company➪Planning 
& Budgeting➪Set Up Forecast. Then, when QuickBooks starts up its clever 
little wizard, you follow the on-screen instructions. If you have questions, you 
can refer to the chapter’s earlier discussion of setting up a budget.
Projecting Cash Flows
If you tell it to, QuickBooks attempts to project your business’s cash flows. 
To tell QuickBooks to do this, choose Company➪Planning & Budgeting➪
Cash Flow Projector. Then, when QuickBooks starts up its clever little wizard, 
you follow the on-screen instructions. (This cash flow projector essentially 
automates the same process that you’d step through on a scratch pad or the 
back of an envelope.)
Using the Business Planner Tools
Depending on the version of QuickBooks that you use, one other command 
may be available on the Planning & Budgeting submenu: Use Business Plan 
Tool. The Use Business Planner command starts another software program 
that steps you through writing a business plan. When you choose the 
command, QuickBooks starts the business plan software, and you write your 
business plan by following the on-screen steps (see Figure 12-4). If you’re 
interested in using this tool, just experiment. You can’t do any damage to the 
QuickBooks data file.

have quite a bit of free business-planning information available at my www.

that you can use.

In This Chapter
 Using the QuickBooks online payment services
 Using the QuickBooks online banking service
 Reviewing other online services
I
n this chapter, I start by discussing the QuickBooks online banking and 
bill payment features, which are pretty cool tools for some businesses. At 
the end of the chapter, I also briefly discuss some of the other online services 
that Intuit provides for QuickBooks users.
Doing the Electronic Banking Thing
Before I discuss using the QuickBooks online banking and payment services, 
you need to consider whether these features even make sense for you and 
your business. Online banking does make sense for some people — maybe 
even you. But then again, it might be more like the fins on a ’62 Cadillac: cool, 
but not that cool.
So what’s the commotion about?
For QuickBooks, online banking includes two parts: online banking itself 
and online bill payment. Basically, online banking enables you to transmit 
account transfer instructions to your bank and download (retrieve) account 
information electronically by using your computer and the Internet. Online 
bill payment allows you to transmit payment instructions electronically. 
(You basically tell your bank to write, stamp, and mail a check so that you 
don’t have to.)
And that, my friend, is about all there is to online banking.

238
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
A thousand reasons not to bank online
I don’t know whether you should bank online, really, but I’ll share some 
thoughts with you. And no kidding, I’ve had my reservations over the years 
about this feature. Is it safe? Is it easy? Is it just another way for a software 
company — Intuit, in this case — to make more money off of me?
Here’s my latest thinking on the matter: You ought to use online banking. 
It is safe if you don’t share your personal identification number (PIN), and it 
saves you tons of time. In fact, online banking should allow many business 
owners to do their books themselves for just a few minutes of work at the 
end of the week.
That being said, I should quickly point out the few flies in the ointment, so 
to speak:
 
 Your bank needs to use the Intuit service. To use the full-blown online 
banking service, you need to use a bank that has signed up for this 
Intuit service. Many, many big banks have signed up. More banks sign 
up all the time, of course, but some haven’t yet. So if your bank hasn’t 
jumped on the bandwagon — that is, the Intuit bandwagon — you 
can’t jump on the bandwagon either. Or, at least not as a full-fledged 
member of the band.
 
 To find out whether your bank provides online banking, choose 
Banking➪Online Banking➪Participating Financial Institutions. After 
you’re connected to the Internet, QuickBooks displays a list of the banks 
that support the Intuit flavor of online banking.
 
 It isn’t totally paperless. Although a totally electronic system sounds 
efficient and very slick, you need to realize that online bill payment 
(a key component of online banking) often isn’t that efficient or slick 
because, to be quite honest, the system isn’t totally electronic.
 
 “What the . . . ?” you’re saying. “I thought that was the point.” Let me 
explain: For better or worse, most businesses are still set up to — and 
still expect to — receive paper checks with remittance advices. What 
often happens when you transmit payment instructions is that the bank 
or online payment service simply prints a check for you. Think about 
that for a minute. If the bank is printing your check, you still have all the 
disadvantages of a printed check, like the following:
 
• You still need to allow extra time for mailing.
 
• You still have the possibility that the check will get lost.
 
• You still have the possibility that the check will be misapplied. In 
other words, the check to pay your power bill might instead be 
applied to your neighbor’s account.

239
 Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks
 
 There’s a greater chance for error. What’s more, you have the extra 
complication of having your bank, rather than you, mucking up all 
this stuff.
 
 It ain’t free. Best of all, the bank most likely charges for this service. 
And so does Intuit. (Remember that banks and software companies think 
that online banking is an exciting new way for them to make money.)
 
 You might run into possible vendor confusion. Receiving payments 
from your bank, as opposed to directly from you, might confuse your 
vendors. The confusion occurs because the checks that they receive 
come all bundled up in these cute little envelopes that must be torn 
along the perforation on just about all sides. And because you can’t send 
a remittance slip with an online payment, vendors can easily credit your 
account incorrectly, which can lead to problems. (My power company 
regularly threatens to turn off the gas to my office because even though 
my electric and gas charges are included on the same bill, the power 
company doesn’t like me to send one check via the QuickBooks online 
bill payment system. It needs two checks: one for the electric bill and 
one for the gas bill.)
 
One other problem bears mentioning. When you use online banking, you 
create a complex system without clear responsibilities for problem-solving 
and technical support. And that means that when you have problems, you 
often can’t call someone to get help. (No kidding. Just the other day, some 
poor guy e-mailed me because his online banking stuff wasn’t working: Intuit 
blamed the bank, the bank blamed his PC hardware, the PC company blamed 
Intuit. . . . This guy has a problem that nobody can solve or will solve.) This is 
important to understand, so let me briefly outline the steps that an online 
payment might take:
 
1. You enter the transaction in QuickBooks.
 
2. You make, or QuickBooks makes, an Internet connection.
 
3. QuickBooks uses the Internet connection to send the transaction to the 
bank.
 
4. The bank receives the transaction information and typically creates a 
check, which it mails to the person you’re paying.
 
5. The person you’re paying gets the check, hopefully, and credits your 
account.
Five simple steps, right? Wrong. Any of these five steps can go wrong — and 
if one does, you don’t actually make the payment or transfer, and you won’t 
know why:
 
 Bugs happen. If QuickBooks or your computer has a bug, it might say 
that you entered and transmitted a transaction when in fact you haven’t. 
This has happened to me.

240
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
 Ya gotta get online. If your Internet connection doesn’t work or doesn’t 
work dependably, you can’t send the online transaction. I’ve had prob-
lems both with online banking at home over a dialup Internet connection 
(bad telephone cord) and at work when using a network and a DSL 
connection (either an incorrectly configured network or a bad DSL).
 
 Banks are fallible. If the bank screws up printing or mailing the check, 
well, of course your check won’t get there. (I’ve had this happen, too — 
no kidding. QuickBooks lets you enter a five-line address on a check, 
but the check printed by the bank or online payment service can have 
only four lines. So QuickBooks just removes the fifth line of the 
address block.)
I don’t mean to rant here, but whenever any of these problems occurs, you 
won’t actually know what’s gone wrong — only that something has gone 
wrong. And you’ll be responsible for solving the problem even though it 
might be the fault of your bank, Intuit, your Internet service provider, the 
telephone company, or somebody else.
Making sense of online banking
So what should you do? Let me make a suggestion: If you use a bank that 
provides online banking, go ahead and try the service. Absolutely! It isn’t 
very expensive — probably a few dollars per month. If you decide later 
on that you don’t like the service, you can always go back to banking the 
old-fashioned way.
Finding a bank you can trust
Say you want to use the Intuit online banking 
services, but your bank isn’t signed up. In 
response to this problem, many people might 
say, “Well, dodo-brain, just switch banks.” But 
not you. You know that switching banks is 
harder than it sounds, especially for small busi-
nesses — and often is not a smart move. Many 
factors go into a successful small business 
banking relationship:
  Convenience: Doing your banking should 
be easy.
  Trust based on a long history: With this in 
hand, you can borrow money or set up 
merchant credit card accounts without 
using your children for collateral.
  Good rapport with a personal banker or 
loan officer: If you ever have a problem — 
and I hope that doesn’t happen — you have 
someone to whom you can talk.
Sure, online banking is neat. Like Cadillac fins. 
But online banking is neither the only nor the 
most important feature you need to look at when 
you consider a bank.

241
 Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks
 
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking services and you’re 
bummed out about it, you can try the online bill payment component of online 
banking by using the Intuit online bill payment service. Online bill payment is 
the part where you send instructions either to your bank (if it provides 
the service) or to Intuit to write and mail checks for you. You can use the 
online bill payment service with any account — in essence, you just give 
Intuit permission to automatically deduct money from your account to make 
payments for you.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking and you couldn’t care 
less, don’t try the online banking stuff, don’t read any more of this chapter, 
and consider taking the rest of the afternoon off.
Signing up for the service
All you need to do to sign up for online banking service is to choose 
Banking➪Online Banking➪Set Up Account for Online Service. QuickBooks 
starts an online application wizard that walks you through the steps to apply 
for the online banking service. Just follow the on-screen instructions, and 
voilà! That’s it. Another benefit of being literate.
 
To actually begin transmitting online payments or making account inquiries, 
you need to complete the application and have that application processed. 
Note, too, that you can also usually complete the application by filling out 
paperwork from your bank and turning that in. You might not have to use the 
online application process.
Making an online payment
Plan to create and send online payments a good week before they’re due. 
Processing your request and then printing and sending a check takes time for 
the online bill payment service. And a check that your bank sends doesn’t go 
through the mail any faster than a check you send yourself. So don’t expect 
online bill payment to save you any time over sending checks that you print 
or hand-write yourself.
After you sign up for online banking, making payments is easy. Just follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Write Checks.
 
 You can also click the Write Checks icon on the Home screen. If you’ve 
written checks with QuickBooks before, you probably recognize your 
old familiar friend, the Write Checks window, as shown in Figure 13-1.

242
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
Figure 13-1: 
The Write 
Checks 
window. 
Hey, this 
looks 
familiar, 
doesn’t it?
 
 
2. Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window, and 
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
 
 Choosing the account is an important step. Make sure that you’re 
accessing the right account before you write a check.
 
3. Select the Online Payment check box.
 
 Selecting this check box is another important step. If you don’t select 
this check box, you aren’t making an online payment; rather, you’re just 
writing a regular check that you need to print or hand-write.
 
4. Fill in the check.
 
 If the payee appears on one of your name lists, the AutoFill feature fills 
in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line after you type a 
few letters. For online bill payment, you must have the correct address. 
If the address is incomplete, QuickBooks warns you and asks you to 
correct it. If you haven’t entered a transaction for this person or party 
before or added them to a list, QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set 
Up the payee name. Do that.
 
 By the way, QuickBooks makes you collect more information about 
anyone you’re going to pay with an online payment.
 
 Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign, and press Tab. 
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line.

243
 Chapter 13: Online with QuickBooks
 
5. Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
 
 Don’t know what these tabs are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute 
detail. Start turning those pages.
 
6. Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to finish 
writing the check.
 
 Click Save & New to write another check, or click Save & Close if you’re 
finished writing checks for the moment. There you have it. Your check is 
written, entered in the Checking register, and ready to be sent so that 
your bank or Intuit can print and mail it.
 
 And you thought this stuff was going to be tough, didn’t you?
People who have grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin product of 
QuickBooks, may want to use the Register window to make online payments. 
You can use the Register window in QuickBooks, too, although doing so isn’t 
quite as slick. You just enter the payment in the usual way, except that you 
type the word SEND in the Check Number text box.
Transferring money electronically
You can electronically transfer money between bank accounts, too, as long 
as the accounts are at the same bank. (Both accounts, of course, also need to 
be set for online banking.) Here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Transfer Funds.
 
 You see the Transfer Funds between Accounts window.
 
2. From the Transfer Funds From drop-down list, choose the bank 
account that you’re going to transfer the money from.
 
3. From the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, choose the bank account 
to which you want to transfer the money.
 
 Select the account that you want to receive the funds.
 
4. Select the Online Funds Transfer check box.
 
 Doing so tells QuickBooks that you want to make this transfer 
electronically.
 
5. Enter the amount that you want to transfer in the Transfer Amount 
field and then fill in the Memo text box.
 
 Someday, you might go into the register for the account that you’re 
transferring money from and wonder where you transferred this money 
and why. Filling in the Memo line solves this little mystery beforehand.

6. Click Save & Close.
 
 The transfer is recorded. After you transmit the transfer instructions 
(which I describe a little later in this chapter), the transfer transaction 
is posted to your account — maybe not immediately, but as fast as a 
telephone transfer or an ATM transfer is posted.
Changing instructions
QuickBooks doesn’t actually send, or transmit, your payment and transfer 
instructions until you tell it to. This little fact means that you can change 
or edit your payment instructions (what you enter with the Write Checks 
window) and your transfer instructions (what you enter with the Transfer 
Funds between Accounts window) until you actually transmit them. You 
edit online payments and account transfers in the same way that you edit 
regular payments and account transfers. Read Chapter 8 if you need more 
information.
Transmitting instructions
After you describe the online payments and account transfers that you want 
QuickBooks to make, you transmit that information to the bank. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Online Banking➪Online Banking Center or click the 
Online Banking icon on the Home screen.
 
 You see the Online Banking Center window, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
2. From the Financial Institution drop-down list at the top of the screen, 
choose the bank to which you’re transmitting payment and transfer 
instructions.
 
3. Review the payment and transfer instructions one last time.
 
 Take one last peek at the Items to Send list to make sure that any 
payment and transfer instructions that you’re sending are correct. If 
you have questions about a particular instruction, click it and then 
click the Edit button. If you know that a particular payment instruction 
is incorrect, click it and then click the Delete button.
 
4. Click the Send/Receive Transactions button to transmit the payment 
and transfer instructions.
 
 QuickBooks prompts you to provide a PIN (personal identification 
number) with a cute little dialog box. If you’re transmitting payment and 
transfer instructions for the first time, QuickBooks probably prompts 
you to change your PIN.

5. Review any transactions that the bank tells you about.
 
 After QuickBooks makes the connection and sends and receives transac-
tions, it updates the information shown in the Online Banking Center 
window. You can get more information about many of the listed items by 
clicking. You can add transactions that QuickBooks downloads from the 
bank but aren’t yet in your bank account registers by clicking the Add 
Transactions to QuickBooks button (which appears at the bottom of the 
window).
 
6. Click the Close box.
 
 Hey, when you’re done, you’re done.
Message in a bottle
Doing all your banking electronically can be a little unsettling when you’re 
starting out. What if, for example, you have a question? All you do is send an 
e-mail message to the bank, asking the people there whatever question you 
would normally ask in a telephone call or at the drive-through window. To do 
so, follow these steps:

246
Part III: Stuff You Do from Time to Time 
 
1. Click the Create Messages hyperlink, which appears roughly in the 
middle of the Online Banking Center window.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Online Banking Message dialog box (see 
Figure 13-3) and fills in the bank name (as long as you use online banking 
services with only one bank). If you use online banking services with 
more than one bank, choose the name of the bank to which you want to 
send a message from the Message To drop-down list.
 
2. Click the Subject text box and then type a brief description of your 
message’s subject.
 
 I may be telling you something you already know, but most e-mail 
programs simply display a list of messages that includes the sender, 
the message subject, and the date. Therefore, the message subject 
that you use is one of the first bits of message information that the bank 
folks see.
 
3. Select the online account that you will discuss in the message.
 
4. Click in the Message text box and then type your message.
 
 You’re on your own here.

Intuit also says it provides a small business purchasing service that makes 
price shopping over the Internet easy, or at least easier. And finally, as I hint 
in Chapter 11, some of QuickBooks payroll services are very online-ish.

I
 hope this doesn’t surprise you, but your accounting 
system requires a bit of tender loving care. Oh, no, 
don’t worry. Nothing unexpected. . . .
But you will want to know how to reconcile accounts (to

dust-free, and how to deal with some of the more tedious 
accounting chores, including fixed assets accounting and 
job costing.

The Balancing Act
In This Chapter
 Balancing a bank account
 Eleven things to do if your account doesn’t balance
I
want to start this chapter with an important point: Balancing a bank 
account in QuickBooks is easy and quick.
I’m not just trying to get you pumped up about an otherwise painfully boring 
topic. I don’t think that balancing a bank account is any more exciting than 
you do.
My point is simply this: Because bank account balancing can be tedious and 
boring, use QuickBooks to reduce the drudgery.
Balancing a Bank Account
As I said, balancing a bank account is remarkably easy in QuickBooks. In fact, 
I’ll go so far as to say that if you have any problems, they stem from . . . well, 
sloppy record keeping that preceded your use of QuickBooks.
Enough of this blather; I’ll get started by describing how you reconcile an 
account.
Giving QuickBooks information 
from the bank statement
In a reconciliation, as you probably know, you compare your records of 
a bank account with the bank’s records of the same account. You should 
be able to explain any difference between the two accounts — usually by 

252
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
pointing to checks you wrote which haven’t yet cleared. (Sometimes deposits 
fall into the same category; you record a deposit and mail it, but the bank 
hasn’t yet credited your account.)
The first step, then, is to supply QuickBooks the bank’s account information. 
You get this information from your monthly statement. Supply QuickBooks 
the figures it needs, as follows:
 
1. Choose Banking➪Reconcile or click the Reconcile icon on the Home 
screen.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 14-1.
 
 If you have several bank accounts, you may have to select which 
account you want to reconcile.
 
2. If the bank account shown isn’t the one you want to reconcile, open 
the Account list and choose the correct account.
 
3. Enter the bank statement date into the Statement Date text box.
 
 You can adjust a date one day at a time by using the plus (+) and 
minus (–) keys. You can also click the Calendar button on the right 
side of the Statement Date text box to select a date from the calendar. 
See the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a list of other secret 
date-editing tricks.
 
4. Verify the bank statement opening balance.
 
 QuickBooks displays an amount labeled Beginning Balance (as shown 
in Figure 14-1).
 
 If the opening balance isn’t correct, see the sidebar, “Why isn’t my open-
ing balance the same as the one in QuickBooks?”, later in this chapter.
 
5. Enter the ending balance from your bank statement into the Ending 
Balance text box.
 
6. Enter the bank’s service charge.
 
 If the bank statement shows a service charge and you haven’t already 
entered it, move the cursor to the Service Charge text box and type the 
amount. (For example, type 50 for a $50 service charge.)
 
7. Enter a transaction date for the service charge transaction.
 
 QuickBooks adds one month to the service charge date from the last 
time you reconciled. If this date isn’t correct, type the correct one.

253
 Chapter 14: The Balancing Act
 
Figure 14-1: 
The Begin 
Recon-
ciliation 
dialog box.
 
 
8. Assign the bank’s service charge to an account.
 
 Enter the expense account to which you assign bank service charges in 
the first Account text box — the one beside the Date text box. Activate 
the drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the category 
by using the arrow keys, and press then Enter. I’ll bet anything that you 
record these charges in the Bank Service Charges account that 
QuickBooks sets up by default.
 
 If you told QuickBooks that you also want to track income and expense 
amounts by using classes, QuickBooks adds Class boxes to the Begin 
Reconciliation dialog box so that you can collect this information.
 
9. Enter the account’s interest income.
 
 If the account earned interest for the month and you haven’t already 
entered this figure, type an amount in the Interest Earned text box.
 
10. Enter a transaction date for the interest income transaction.
 
 You already know how to enter dates. I won’t bore you by explaining it 
again (but see Step 3 if you’re having trouble).
 
11. Assign the interest to an account.
 
 In the second Account text box, enter the account to which this 
account’s interest should be assigned. I bet that you record this one 
under the Interest Income account, which is near the bottom of the 
Account drop-down list. To select a category from the Account list, 
activate the drop-down list by clicking the down arrow, highlight 
the category, and then press Enter.
 
12. Click the Continue button.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Reconcile window, as shown in Figure 14-2.

254
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Figure 14-2: 
The 
Reconcile 
window.
 
Marking cleared checks and deposits
From the Reconcile window, shown in Figure 14-2, you tell QuickBooks which 
deposits and checks have cleared at the bank. (Refer to your bank statement 
for this information.) Follow these steps:
 
1. Identify the first deposit that has cleared.
 
 You know how to do this, I’m sure. Just leaf through the bank statement 
and find the first deposit listed.
 
2. Mark the first cleared deposit as cleared.
 
 Scroll through the transactions listed in the Deposits and Other Credits 
section of the Reconcile window, find the deposit, and then click it. You 
also can highlight the deposit by using the Tab and arrow keys and then 
pressing the spacebar. QuickBooks places a check mark in front of the 
deposit to mark it as cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
 
 If you have a large number of deposits to clear and you can identify 
them quickly, click the Mark All button and then simply unmark the 
transactions that aren’t on the bank statement. To unmark a transaction, 
click it. The check mark disappears.

255
 Chapter 14: The Balancing Act
 
3. Record any cleared but missing deposits.
 
 If you can’t find a deposit in the Reconcile window, you haven’t entered 
it into the Checking register yet. I can only guess why you haven’t 
entered it. Maybe you just forgot. Close or deactivate the Reconcile 
window by clicking the Leave button. Now open the Checking register 
and enter the deposit in the register in the usual way. To return to the 
Reconcile window, either reopen it or reactivate it. Or, you can just 
choose Banking➪Make Deposits and open the deposit screen right on 
top of the Reconcile Window, if you like. Record the deposit and then 
click the Save & Close button. Now the deposit appears in the Reconcile 
Deposits and Other Credits area.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1–3 for all deposits listed on the bank statement.
 
 Make sure that the dates match and that the amounts of the deposits are 
correct. If they’re not, go back to the transactions and correct them. To 
get to a transaction, click the Go To button. You see the Write Checks or 
Make Deposits window where the transaction was originally recorded. 
Make the corrections there and then click Save & Close. You return to 
the Reconcile window.
 
5. Identify the first check that has cleared.
 
 No sweat, right? Just find the first check or withdrawal listed on the 
bank statement.
 
6. Mark the first cleared check as cleared.
 
 Scroll through the transactions listed in the Checks and Payments 
section of the Reconcile window; find the first check; and then click it. 
You also can highlight it by pressing Tab and an arrow key. Then press 
the spacebar. QuickBooks inserts a check mark to label this transaction 
as cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
 
7. Record any missing but cleared checks.
 
 If you can’t find a check or withdrawal in QuickBooks, guess what? You 
haven’t entered it in the register yet. Close or deactivate the Reconcile 
window by clicking its Leave button or by activating another window. 
Then display the Checking register and enter the check or withdrawal. 
To return to the Reconcile window, reopen or reactivate it. Or, you 
can just choose Banking➪Write Checks, create the check right on top 
of the Reconcile window, and then click Save & Close to return to the 
Reconcile screen and carry on from where you left off.
 
8. Repeat Steps 5–7 for all withdrawals listed on the bank statement.
 
These steps don’t take long. Reconciling my account each month takes me 
about two minutes. And I’m not joking or exaggerating.

256
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
If the difference equals zero
After you mark all cleared checks and deposits, the difference between the 
Cleared Balance for the account and the bank statement’s Ending Balance 
should equal zero. Notice that I said should — not will. Figure 14-2, fortu-
nately, shows a Reconcile window in which everything is hunky-dory. If the 
difference is small, look for small differences between the amount of the 
checks in the register and the actual cleared checks on the bank statement. If 
you find a discrepancy with a particular check, just click the Go To button to 
go to the check and change the amount. Click Save & Close to go right back 
to the Reconcile screen.
If the difference does equal zero, you’re finished. Just click the Reconcile 
Now button. QuickBooks displays a congratulatory message box telling 
you that the reconciliation is complete. As a reward for being such a good 
boy or girl, the message box asks you whether you want to print a free, 
all-expenses-paid Summary or Full reconciliation report. Click Summary 
or Full, and then click OK if you want to print the report. Otherwise, just 
click OK.
Why isn’t my opening balance the 
same as the one in QuickBooks?
An opening balance that isn’t the same as the 
one shown in the Opening Balance text box can 
mean a couple of things.
First, you may have mistakenly cleared a trans-
action the last time you reconciled. If you 
cleared a transaction last month that didn’t go 
through until this month, your opening balance 
is wrong. Go back to the Checking register and 
start examining transactions. Each one that’s 
cleared has a check mark next to it in the 
narrow column between the Payment and 
Deposit columns. If one of the checks that 
appear on this month’s statement has a check 
mark, you made a boo-boo last month. From the 
Checking register, click the check mark to 
remove it. You’re asked to confirm your actions. 
The check now appears in the Reconcile 
window.
The other reason why the opening balance can 
be different is that a transaction that you 
cleared in the past got changed. If you deleted 
a transaction that occurred before this recon-
ciliation period, for example, it threw your bal-
ance off. Why? Because the transaction that 
you deleted helped balance your account the 
last time around, but now that transaction 
is gone.
Whatever happens, don’t fret. If you can’t track 
down the faulty transaction, you can just have 
QuickBooks adjust the balance for you, which I 
explain elsewhere in this chapter. If you fre-
quently find that your accounts don’t balance, 
consider using the QuickBooks Audit Trail 
report, which lists changes to the QuickBooks 
data, when it’s time to reconcile your 
accounts.

257
 Chapter 14: The Balancing Act
 
Can’t decide whether to print the reconciliation report? Unless you’re a 
business bookkeeper or an accountant who is reconciling a bank account 
for someone else — your employer or a client, for example — you don’t 
need to print the reconciliation report. All printing does is prove that you 
reconciled the account. (Basically, this proof is the reason why you should 
print the report if you’re a bookkeeper or an accountant. The person for 
whom you’re reconciling the account will know that you did your job and 
will have a piece of paper to come back to later with any questions.) Also, you 
can always come back and print the report later, if necessary. QuickBooks 
saves the Reconciliation reports under Reports, Banking, Previous 
Reconciliation.
Now each deposit, withdrawal, and check that you just cleared is marked 
with a check mark in your register. If you don’t believe me, open the register 
and find out.
If the difference doesn’t equal zero
If the difference doesn’t equal zero, you have a problem. If you click the 
Reconcile Now button, QuickBooks shows you the Reconcile Adjustment 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-3. This dialog box tells you how unbalanced 
your account is and asks whether you want to adjust your maladjusted 
account.
Click the Return to Reconcile button if you want to go back to the Reconcile 
window and start the search for the missing or incorrectly entered 
transaction.
 
If you want to force the two amounts to agree, click OK. Forcing the two 
amounts to agree isn’t a very good idea. To do so, QuickBooks adds a cleared 
transaction equal to the difference. (I talk about this transaction a little later in 
the chapter.)
 
Figure 14-3: 
The 
Reconcile 
Adjustment 
dialog box.
 

258
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Postponing a reconciliation (by clicking the Leave Reconcile button) and not 
choosing to adjust the bank account balance is usually the best approach 
because then you can locate and correct problems. (The next section 
contains some ideas that can help you determine what the problem is.) 
Then you can restart the reconciliation and finish your work. (You restart a 
reconciliation the same way that you originate one.)
Eleven Things to Do If Your Non-Online 
Account Doesn’t Balance
 
I want to give you some suggestions for reconciling an account when you’re 
having problems. If you’re sitting in front of your computer, wringing your 
hands, try the tips in this section:
 
 Make sure that you’re working with the right account. Sounds dumb, 
doesn’t it? If you have several bank accounts, however, ending up in 
the wrong account is darn easy. So go ahead and confirm, for example, 
that you’re trying to reconcile your checking account at Mammoth 
International Bank by using the Mammoth International Bank checking 
account statement.
 
 Look for transactions that the bank has recorded but you haven’t. 
Go through the bank statement to make sure that you recorded every 
transaction that your bank has recorded. You can easily overlook 
cash-machine withdrawals, special fees, or service charges (such as 
charges for checks or your safe deposit box), automatic withdrawals, 
direct deposits, and so on.
 
 If the difference is positive — that is, the bank thinks that you have less 
money than you think that you should have — you may be missing a 
withdrawal transaction. If the difference is negative, you may be missing 
a deposit transaction.
 
 Look for reversed transactions. Here’s a tricky one: If you accidentally 
enter a transaction backward — a deposit as a withdrawal or a with-
drawal as a deposit — your account doesn’t balance. And the error 
can be difficult to find. The Reconcile window shows all the correct 
transactions, but a transaction amount appears in the wrong list. 
(The amount appears in the Deposits and Other Credits list when it 
belongs in the Checks and Payments list, or vice versa.) The check that 
you wrote to Acme Housewreckers for the demolition of your carport 
appears in the Deposits and Other Credits list, for example.

259
 Chapter 14: The Balancing Act
 
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to half the difference. One handy 
way to find the transaction that you entered backward — if you have 
only one — is to look for a transaction that’s equal to half the irreconcil-
able difference. If the difference is $200, for example, you may have 
entered a $100 deposit as a withdrawal or a $100 withdrawal as a deposit.
 
 Look for a transaction that’s equal to the difference. While I’m on the 
subject of explaining the difference by looking at individual transactions, 
I’ll make an obvious point: If the difference between the bank’s records 
and yours equals one of the transactions listed in your register, you may 
have incorrectly marked the transaction as cleared or incorrectly left 
the transaction unmarked (shown as uncleared). I don’t know. Maybe 
that was too obvious. Naaaah.
 
 Check for transposed numbers. Transposed numbers are flip-flopped 
digits. For example, you enter $45.89 as $48.59. These turkeys always 
cause headaches for accountants and bookkeepers. If you look at the 
numbers, detecting an error is often difficult because the digits are the 
same. For example, when you compare a check amount of $45.89 in your 
register with a check for $48.59 shown on your bank statement, both 
check amounts show the same digits: 4, 5, 8, and 9. They just show them 
in a different order.
 
 Transposed numbers are tough to find, but here’s a trick that you can 
try: Divide the difference shown in the Reconcile window by 9. If the 
result is an even number of dollars or cents, chances are good that you 
have a transposed number somewhere.
 
 Use the Locate Discrepancies button. Would you mind, terribly, 
taking a peek back at Figure 14-1? The dialog box shown in that figure 
includes a Locate Discrepancies button, which you can click to display 
another dialog box that prints reports that may help you reconcile 
your account. In particular, the dialog box lets you view a report 
of changes made to previously cleared transactions (which would be 
pretty suspicious bookkeeping activity and would definitely foul up 
your reconciliation). It also shows a report that lists transactions 
marked as cleared during previous reconciliations, which might be 
interesting because maybe you erroneously marked a transaction as 
cleared before it was cleared.
 
 Have someone else look over your work. This idea may seem pretty 
obvious, but I’m amazed by how often a second pair of eyes can find 
something that I overlooked. Ask one of your co-workers or employees 
(preferably that one person who always seems to have way too much 
free time) to look over everything for you.

260
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
 Be on the lookout for multiple errors. If you find an error by using 
this laundry list, and you still have a difference, start checking at 
the top of the list again. You may discover, for example, after you find 
a transposed number that you entered another transaction backward 
or incorrectly cleared or uncleared a transaction.
 
 Try again next month (and maybe the month after that). If the 
difference isn’t huge in relation to the size of your bank account, you 
may want to wait until next month and attempt to reconcile your 
account again.
 
 Before my carefree attitude puts you in a panic, consider the following 
example: In January, you reconcile your account, and the difference is 
$24.02. Then you reconcile the account in February, and the difference 
is $24.02. You reconcile the account in March, and — surprise, surprise — 
the difference is still $24.02. What’s going on here? Well, your starting 
account balance was probably off by $24.02. (The more months you try to 
reconcile your account and find that you’re always mysteriously $24.02 
off, the more likely that this type of error is to blame.) After the second or 
third month, I think that having QuickBooks enter an adjusting transac-
tion of $24.02 is pretty reasonable so that your account balances. (In my 
opinion, this circumstance is the only one that merits your adjusting an 
account to match the bank’s figure.)
 
 If you successfully reconciled your account with QuickBooks before, 
your work may not be at fault. The mistake may be (drum roll, please) 
the bank’s! And in this case, you should do something else. . . .
 
 Get in your car, drive to the bank, and beg for help. As an alternative 
to the preceding idea — which supposes that the bank’s statement is 
correct and that your records are incorrect — I propose this idea: Ask 
the bank to help you reconcile the account. Hint that you think the 
mistake is probably the bank’s, but in a very nice, cordial way. Smile a 
lot. And one other thing: Be sure to ask about whatever product the 
bank is currently advertising in the lobby (which encourages the staff to 
think that you’re interested in that 180-month certificate of deposit, 
causing them to be extra-nice to you).
 
 In general, the bank’s record keeping is usually pretty darn good. I’ve 
never had a problem either with my business or personal accounts. (I’ve 
also been lucky enough to deal with big, well-run banks.) Nevertheless, 
your bank quite possibly has made a mistake, so ask for help. Be sure to 
ask for an explanation of any transactions that you discover only by 
seeing them on your bank statement. By the way, you’ll probably pay for 
this help.

o find out whether your business is thriving or diving, you use the 
QuickBooks Reports feature. The different kinds of reports in 
QuickBooks cover everything from cash flow to missing checks, not to

can get from the information on forms, account registers, or lists by merely 
clicking the mouse.
In this chapter, I tell you how to prepare reports, how to print them, and how 
to customize reports for your special needs.
What Kinds of Reports 
Are There, Anyway?
If you run a small business, you don’t need all the reports that QuickBooks 
offers, but many of these reports are extremely useful. Reports show you 
how healthy or unhealthy your business is, where your profits are, and 
where you’re wasting time and squandering resources.
To make sense of what might otherwise become mass confusion, QuickBooks 
organizes all its reports in categories. You can see what all the categories are 
by pulling down the Reports menu or by clicking the Report Center icon. The 

262

names of the reports read a bit like public television documentary names, 
don’t they? “Tonight, Joob Taylor explores the mazelike federal budget in 
Budget Reports.” You select a report category to see a list of report names.
In Table 15-1, I describe reports by category and give a short description of 
the major reports in each category. To get a thorough description of a par-
ticular report, go to the Help feature. To find out what a standard profit and 
loss report does, for example, choose Help➪QuickBooks Help, and click the 
Search tab. Type financial statements in the text box. (The Help information 
includes a wonderful discussion about how to understand the profit and loss 
and balance sheet financial statements.) Or, from the Reports Center, select 
the type of report on the left; you see a list of the different reports available 
on the right side, with a description of the information contained in each 
one. To read the details about a topic, click that topic in the list.

These accounts receivable reports are great for finding out 
where you stand in regard to your customer invoices. You can 
list unpaid invoices and group them in various ways, including 
by customer, job, and aging status.
Sales
These reports show what you sold and who your customers 
are. You can see your sales by item, by customer, or by sales 
representative.
Jobs, Time &

These reports let you see job and item profitability, compare 
job estimates versus actual costs, view time recorded on jobs 
and activities, and look at vehicle mileage.

Payables
These accounts payable reports tell you everything you need 
to know about your unpaid bills. You can list bills in a variety of 
ways, including by vendor and by aging status. This category 
also includes a report for determining sales tax liability.
Purchases
These reports show from whom you bought, what you bought, 
and how much you paid. You can list purchases by item or by 
vendor. One handy report shows any outstanding purchase 
orders.

Category
Description
Inventory
These reports help answer the ever-important question, “What 
items do I have in stock?” You can get an enormous amount of 
detail from these reports. For example, you can find out how 
many of an item you have on hand and how many you have 
on order. You can group inventory by vendor or by item. If you 
need price lists, you can print them by using a special report 
from your QuickBooks file.
Employees & 
Payroll
These reports offer ways to track payroll or check your payroll 
liability accounts. Believe me: These reports come in handy.
Banking
These reports list checks and deposits.
Accountant & 
Taxes
These reports include income tax reports, journal and general 
ledger reports, and a trial balance.
Budgets & 
Forecasts
These reports show you once and for all whether your budget-
ing skills are realistic. You can view budgets by job, by month, 
or by balance sheet account. Then you can compare the 
budgets with actual income and expense totals. (You need to 
have a budget already set up to use this report — something I 
discuss in Chapter 12.)
List
These reports let you see your lists in detail. For example, you 
can see the contacts, phone numbers, and addresses on your 
Customer, Vendor, or Other Names lists. You also can create a 
detailed report of your inventory.
Industry 
Specific
Some versions of QuickBooks also supply industry-specific 
reports under the Industry Specific submenu command. 
QuickBooks, at the time of this writing, provides industry-
specific versions of QuickBooks for accountants, contractors, 
manufacturers, wholesalers, professional service firms, 
retailers, and nonprofit organizations.
 
If you’re not sure which report you need to create, you can use the Report 
Center. Just choose Reports➪Report Center, choose a report type from the 
list along the left edge of the Report Center window (see Figure 15-1), and 
choose select a report from the list to preview that report.
Creating and Printing a Report
After you decide what report you need, all you have to do is select it from the 
appropriate menu. To create a standard profit and loss report, for example, 
choose Reports➪Company & Financial➪Profit & Loss Standard or select it 
from the Reports Center.

264
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Figure 15-1: 
The Report 
Center 
window.
 
Depending on how much data QuickBooks has to process, you may see a 
Building Report box before the report appears on-screen in all its glory. 
Figure 15-2 shows a standard profit and loss report, also called an income 
statement.
 
If you see a Customize Report dialog box instead of a report, you can tell 
QuickBooks to change this option. To do so, choose Edit➪Preferences and 
then click the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left. Click the My 
Preferences tab, if you have one and it isn’t already selected. Remove the 
check mark from the Prompt Me to Modify Report Options Before Opening a 
Report check box.
 
You can’t see the entire on-screen version of a report unless your report is 
very small (or your screen is monstrously large). Use the Page Up and Page 
Down keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down, and use the Tab and 
Shift+Tab keys to move left and right. Or, if you’re a mouse lover, you can use 
the scroll bar.
To print a report, click the Print button at the top of the report. QuickBooks 
displays the Print Reports dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-3. To accept the 
given specifications, which are almost always fine, click the Print button. 
You’ll never guess what happens next: QuickBooks prints the report!

The first time you print a report, QuickBooks displays a Printing Features 
dialog box that explains a few things about the mechanics of choosing and 
printing reports.

266
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Before I forget, I want to tell you that you can select the File radio button in 
the Print To panel to tell QuickBooks to save the report as a file instead of 
printing it. You can then choose the file format: ASCII Text File, Comma 
Delimited File, or Tab Delimited File. You can use either delimited-file format if 
you want to open the file later with a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft 
Excel. After you click Print, use the Create Disk File dialog box to specify the 
filename and storage location.
The Orientation settings tell QuickBooks how the report is supposed to 
appear on the paper. The Page Range settings specify the pages that you 
want to print. The Fit Report to xx Page(s) Wide check box enables you to 
shrink the report so that it fits on the number of pages you specify. The 
purpose of the Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box is self-evident.
QuickBooks includes two page-break options for creating easier-to-read 
reports:
 
 Mark the first check box (smart page breaks) to keep items that belong 
in the same group on the same page.
 
 Mark the second check box to give each major group its own page.
You also can preview the report by clicking the Preview button.
Visiting the report dog-and-pony show
You can do some neat things with the reports you create. Here’s a quick 
rundown of some of the most valuable tricks:
 
 QuickZooming mysterious figures: If you don’t understand where a 
number in a report comes from, point to it with the mouse. As you point 
to numbers, QuickBooks changes the mouse pointer to a magnifying 
glass marked with a Z. Double-click the mouse to have QuickBooks 
display a list of all the transactions that make up that number.
 
 This feature, called QuickZoom, is extremely handy for understanding 
the figures that appear on reports. All you have to do is double-click any 
mysterious-looking figure in a report. QuickBooks immediately tells you 
exactly how it arrived at that figure.
 
 Sharing report data with Microsoft Excel: You can export report data 
to an Excel spreadsheet by clicking the Export button in the report 
window. QuickBooks displays the Export Report to Excel dialog box. 
You can use this dialog box to specify whether you want to create a new 
spreadsheet for the report data or whether you want to add the report 
data to an existing spreadsheet.

267
 Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs
Editing and rearranging reports
You may have noticed that when QuickBooks displays the report document 
window, it also displays a row of buttons: Modify Report, Memorize, Print, 
E-Mail, Export, and so on (as you can see in Figure 15-2, if you look carefully). 
Below this toolbar are some drop-down lists that have to do with dates, a 
drop-down list called Columns, and a drop-down list called Sort By. (Not all 
these list boxes are available in every report document window. I don’t know 
why, really. Maybe just to keep you guessing.)
You don’t need to worry about these buttons and lists. Read through the 
discussion that follows only if you’re feeling comfortable, relaxed, and truly 
mellow, okay?
Modifying
When you click the Modify Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify 
Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-4. From this dialog box, you can 
change the information displayed on a report and the way that information 
is arranged (by using the Display tab), the data used to generate the report 
(by using the Filters tab), the header and footer information (by using, 
predictably, the Header/Footer tab), and the typeface and size of print used 
for a report (by using the Fonts & Numbers tab).
 
Figure 15-4: 
The Modify 
Report 
dialog box.
 
Memorizing
If you do play around with the remaining buttons, you can save any custom 
report specifications that you create. Just click the Memorize button. 
QuickBooks displays the Memorize Report dialog box (as shown in 

268
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Figure 15-5), which asks you to supply a name for the customized report and 
assign the memorized report to a report group. After you name and assign 
the customized report, QuickBooks lists it whenever you choose Reports➪
Memorized Reports and then click the report group. You can also access 
Memorized Reports from the top of the Report Center screen. Whenever you 
want to use your special report, all you need to do is choose it from the list 
and click the Report button.
 
Figure 15-5: 
The 
Memorize 
Report 
dialog box.
 
 
QuickBooks memorizes the print orientation with the report, so if the print 
orientation isn’t the way you want it for the report, you should first change it 
by choosing File➪Printer Setup. Select the orientation you want to memorize, 
click OK, and then memorize the report.
E-mailing
If you click the E-Mail button, QuickBooks displays the Edit E-Mail Information 
box. It lets you e-mail a PDF version of the report to someone else. All you 
need to know is the receiving person’s e-mail address.
Exporting
If you click the Export button, QuickBooks displays the Export Report 
dialog box (see Figure 15-6). You can use this dialog box to create an Excel 
report that holds the same information as shown in the report. (To do 
this, just press Enter when you see the Export Report dialog box.) You can 
also get fancier in your exporting by exporting a comma-separated values 
file (these files can be opened by other electronic spreadsheet programs 
and by database programs), by exporting to a specific Excel workbook file, 
and by using the Advanced tab to control how the exported information is 
formatted.
A friendly suggestion, perhaps? Feel free to experiment with all the special 
exporting options. Just remember that after you export a QuickBooks report 
to a new, blank Excel workbook, you can also do any of this fancy-dancey 
stuff — special formatting and so on — there.

The other buttons and boxes
If you want to see how the Hide Header, Collapse, and Dates stuff work, just 
noodle around. You can’t hurt anything.
 
If you change the report dates, click the Refresh button to update the report. 
(To set refresh options for reports, choose Edit➪Preferences. Then click 
the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left, and click the My Preferences 
tab if necessary. Click one of the Reports and Graphs options and then 
click OK.)
Reports Made to Order
If you intend to print a large number of reports — and, more important, if 
you intend to print a large number of reports and show them to customers, 
investors, and other significant people — you want your reports to look 
good and to be easy to understand. I believe that beauty is in the eye of the 
beholder, so I’m not going to get into the aesthetics of report layouts. What I 
am going to do is explain how you can make QuickBooks reports look exactly 
the way you want them to look.
Choose Edit➪Preferences. Click the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the 
left and then click the Company Preferences tab to see the Preferences dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 15-7, for reports and graphs.
 
You need to be logged in to single-user mode as the administrator to change 
company preferences. Read how in Appendix C.

270
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Figure 15-7: 
The 
Preferences 
dialog box 
for reports 
and graphs.
 
Here are your options:
 
 Accrual: Accrual is one of those cruel accounting terms that are hard 
to understand at first. If you select the Accrual radio button in the 
Summary Reports Basis panel, you tell QuickBooks to include all your 
transactions, sales, purchases, expenses, and so on, from the moment 
they’re recorded, not from the time you receive or pay cash for them.
 
 Accountants follow the accrual method because it gives a more accurate 
picture of profits. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says that big 
corporations must use accrual accounting for their tax returns.
 
 Cash: If you select the Cash radio button, all the financial transactions in 
your reports are counted at the time you make your expense payments 
and you receive your customers’ payments.
 
 Age from Due Date: If you select the Age from Due Date radio button in 
the Aging Reports panel, QuickBooks counts your expenses and invoices 
from the day that they fall due. Otherwise, QuickBooks counts them 
from the day they’re recorded.
 
 Reports – Show Account By: You select a radio button in the Reports 
Show By button group to indicate how you want QuickBooks to arrange 
account information on your reports: by name, by description, or by 
both name and description.
 
 Statement of Cash Flows: You click the Classify Cash button to tell 
QuickBooks how it should handle its accounts when it produces 
a picture-perfect statement of cash flows using generally accepted 
accounting principles. A suggestion? Leave this for your CPA.
 
 Format: Click the Format button if you want to improve the look of your 
reports. In the Report Format Preferences dialog box that appears, 
as shown in Figure 15-8, you can use the Header/Footer tab to choose 
preferences for displaying the company name, the report title, the 
subtitle, and so on.

271

 You can use the Fonts & Numbers tab to choose preferences for dis-
playing numbers, decimal fractions, and negative numbers. You also 
can fool around with different fonts and point sizes for labels, column 
headings, titles, and other things in your reports.
 
Click the Revert button in the Report Format Preferences dialog box to undo 
your customization changes.
Processing Multiple Reports
Want to print several reports at once? No problem. Choose Reports➪Process 
Multiple Reports. When QuickBooks displays the Process Multiple Reports 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-9, select the reports that you want to print 
or display.

Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Last but Not Least: The QuickReport
The last kind of report is the QuickReport, which is one of the best kinds of 
reports, so I saved it for last. You can generate a QuickReport from a list, 
from invoices and bills with names of people or items on them, and from 
account registers. QuickReports are especially useful when you’re studying a 
list and see something that momentarily baffles you. Simply make sure that 
the item you’re curious about is highlighted, click the Reports button, and 
choose the QuickReports command for the item from the drop-down list.
 
You can also right-click an item and choose QuickReport from the shortcut 
menu to create a QuickReport of the item.
Figure 15-10 shows a QuickReport produced from a Checking register. I 
clicked the QuickReport button to display this Register QuickReport window 
with the transaction information for a vendor: the fictitious Big Bertha’s 
Workshop.
 
Figure 15-10:
 A

273
 Chapter 15: Reporting on the State of Affairs
The QuickReport option is also on the Reports menu when you have a 
register or list open. Often times, then, you can display a QuickReport from a 
form — even though no QuickReport button appears — by choosing the 
menu option. For example, if you’re writing a check to a vendor, you can 
enter the company’s name on the check and choose Reports➪QuickReport to 
see a report of transactions involving the company.

Q
uickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise have 
a feature that’s very interesting for businesspeople — such as contrac-
tors, consultants, engineers, and architects — who do jobs or projects for their 
customers. QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks Premier have the capability to 
do simple project or job costing. This capability means that your business can 
create project or job estimates, track costs by project or job, and bill invoices 
by project or job.
In this short chapter, I describe the QuickBooks job costing feature.
Turning On Job Costing
To turn on the job costing or estimating feature in QuickBooks, choose 
Edit➪Preferences. Click the Jobs & Estimates icon on the left; click the 
Company Preferences tab (as shown in Figure 16-1); and then use the Do You 
Create Estimates? and Do You Do Progress Invoicing? radio buttons to tell 
QuickBooks whether, in fact, you want to do these things. You get this, right? 
You select the Yes radio button if you do, and select the No radio button if 
you don’t.

276
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Figure 16-1: 
The 
Company 
Preferences 
tab show-
ing Jobs & 
Estimates 
options.
 
While you’re looking at the Company Preferences tab (shown in Figure 16-1), 
let me also mention that as the figure shows, QuickBooks lets you categorize 
jobs as falling into several different status categories: Pending, Awarded, In 
Progress, Closed, and Not Awarded. As you might guess, you use these Job 
Status descriptions to categorize your jobs.
Setting Up a Job
If you want to use QuickBooks job costing, your first step is to set up a job. 
For example, if you’re a contractor, you can use QuickBooks to track the 
invoices and costs of the remodeling jobs you do. You just need to set up a 
job every time you get ready to bid on a project.
To set up a job, first set up a customer in the usual way. Then set up a job 
also in the usual way. In Chapter 3, I describe how you do all this, so I won’t 
repeat that information here. Just to save you time, however, all you need to 
do is choose Customers➪Customer Center to display the Customer Center 
window, right-click the customer for whom you might do a job, and then 
choose the Add Job command from the Customer:Job pop-up menu. When 
QuickBooks displays the New Job window, describe the job by filling out the 
fields in the window that QuickBooks displays.
Creating a Job Estimate
In QuickBooks, job costing starts with an estimate. An estimate is just a list of 
the estimated costs you’ll incur for some job you’ll perform for some customer.
Assuming that you’ve already created a job and have told QuickBooks that 
you use estimates, here are the steps that you follow to create an estimate:

277
 Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking
 
1. Choose Customers➪Create Estimates.
 
 QuickBooks opens a Create Estimates form (see Figure 16-2), which 
bears an uncanny resemblance to the Create Invoices form that you’ve 
seen if you’ve worked with QuickBooks at all. (See Chapter 4 for more 
information about the Create Invoices form.)
 
Figure 16-2: 
The Create 
Estimates 
window.
 
 
2. Start filling in the blanks.
 
 Choose the appropriate Customer:Job from the drop-down list at the top 
of the form. QuickBooks automatically fills in as much information as it 
can — usually at least the Name/Address text box — on the form.
 
 If you configured QuickBooks to track classes, the appropriate drop-
down list shows up in the top center of the form. Go ahead and use the 
box, if appropriate.
 
 Feel free to change the default settings — the Date and Estimate #, for 
example. The Date Setting tricks that you can find in Chapter 4 and on 
the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book may come in handy here.
 
3. Add the line items — details, details, details.
 
 You fill in the details of a Create Estimates window in the same way that 
you fill in the details of a Create Invoices window. Read Chapter 4 if you 
have questions.

278
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
 One field that is unique to the Create Estimates window is Markup. The 
Markup field, which appears on some versions of the Create Estimates 
window, adds a specified percentage of the line item price total. In 
Figure 16-2, if I had specified a 50% markup using the Markup column, 
the values shown in the Total column would all be 50% greater. The 
Markup field doesn’t appear on all versions of the Estimates template: 
only the Custom Estimate and Proposal templates.
 
 In Chapter 3, I describe how to add items to the QuickBooks Items list. 
Each line item that you want to include on your job estimate needs to 
be described in the Items list. Note that because you often sell work to 
clients and customers by using, in part, an estimate, you’ll typically want 
to include full descriptions of the items. (My construction-contractor 
clients, for example, often use several lines of descriptive text to fully 
explain each item that shows on the estimate.)
 
4. Add any optional information.
 
 If you want to, use any of the other boxes available in the Create 
Estimates window to collect and store additional information. For exam-
ple, just as with the Create Invoices window, you can click the Customer 
Message drop-down list and choose or write a friendly message.
 
 You can also use the Memo field to write a note to yourself regarding 
the job, if you like. Or maybe add some notes about the screenplay that 
you’ve been thinking about pitching to the studios. Whatever suits your 
fancy.
If you want to include other items in the Create Estimates window, you can 
customize that window. Choose Customize from the Template drop-down list 
in the upper-right corner of the Create Estimates window. QuickBooks gives 
you a list of your estimate forms. Choose the one you want to edit. (You may 
have only one estimate form on the list if you’ve never created a new one.) 
Click either the New or the Edit button. If you click New, QuickBooks displays 
the Customize Estimate dialog box.
In Chapter 4, I talk a bit about how to customize invoice forms. You may 
want to look there if you have questions about how to customize the Create 
Invoices form.
 
Before you print that estimate, remember that the Create Estimates window 
isn’t necessarily the same information that appears on the written estimate. 
To see how the printed version looks, click the down arrow beside the Print 
button in the Create Estimates window, and choose Preview from the drop-
down list. The result is a full-page image, shrunk to fit on-screen.
If you haven’t saved your estimate yet, go ahead and click either the Save & 
New button or the Save & Close button.

279
 Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking
 
To examine the estimate (or any on-screen QuickBooks form) more closely, 
either click the Zoom In button at the top of the Print Preview screen or move 
the mouse cursor over the image. When the cursor looks like a magnifying 
glass with a plus sign in it, click the left mouse button. Because you can see 
only part of the preview this way, use the scroll bars at the bottom and right 
of the windows to move around to the different areas.
Note that the magnifying glass now has a minus sign in it, and the Zoom In 
button toggles to Zoom Out. If you complete more than one estimate, you can 
use the Prev Page and Next Page buttons on the Print Preview screen to look 
at other estimates. When you finish, click the Close button.
When you get back to the Create Estimates window, click the Print button; 
QuickBooks Pro displays the Print One Estimate dialog box. Click Print to 
print the estimate without any further ado.
 
If you haven’t used QuickBooks to print estimates before, you may need to 
set up your printer for this task first. To do so, choose File➪Printer Setup 
and then choose Estimate from the Form Name drop-down list. Specify the 
printer settings that you want for printing estimates. (This process works the 
same way as it does for printing other forms, such as invoices, as I describe 
in Chapter 4.) Click OK when you’re done. The Print One Estimate dialog box 
that QuickBooks displays after you click Print in the Create Estimates window 
also works the same way as the Print One Invoice dialog box does. Read 
Chapter 4 if you need help with this dialog box.
Revising an Estimate
To revise an estimate, display the Create Estimates window, as described ear-
lier in this chapter. Then click the Previous button until you see the estimate.
Make your changes, and QuickBooks recalculates all the totals. Smile. 
Imagine doing this task by hand — the recalculations, the looking up of 
prices, the retyping, the inordinate amount of wasted time. Making these 
changes automatically with QuickBooks doesn’t quite beat a hot dog with 
sauerkraut in the park on a sunny day, but it’s pretty close.
 
You can keep only one estimate per job. After you click Save & New, any 
changes that you make automatically take the place of the old estimate. If you 
make changes to an estimate, though, you can tell QuickBooks to treat the 
revision as a change order. With a change order, the modifications to an exist-
ing estimate get added to the bottom of the estimate. Cool, right?

280
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Turning an Estimate into an Invoice
You can easily turn the estimate into an invoice by following these steps:
 
1. On the Customer Center screen, select your customer.
 
 QuickBooks shows you a list of transactions for the customer, including 
any active estimates.
 
2. Double-click the estimate you want to work with.
 
 The Create Estimates window opens. (Refer to Figure 16-2.)
 
3. Click the Create Invoice button at the top of the window.
 
 If you indicated that you might progress-bill a customer or client, 
QuickBooks displays a dialog box that asks whether you want to invoice 
the entire estimate or just some portion of the estimate. Answer the 
question by marking the appropriate option button. Then click OK. 
QuickBooks creates an invoice based on your estimate (see Figure 16-3). 
If you need to make any changes, you edit the invoice directly and then 
click OK to continue.
 
Figure 16-3: 
The Create 
Invoices 
window 
with the 
data from 
Figure 16-2.
 

281
 Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking
 
4. (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the resulting invoice.
 
 The invoice that you see is a regular QuickBooks invoice, and you can 
edit it the same way that you edit any invoice. Until you click Save & 
New, the invoice isn’t recorded in your records.
 
5. After you make all your changes, click Save & New or Save & Close to 
record the invoice.
 
 If you want to print the invoice instead, you can click the Print button.
Comparing Estimated Item 
with Actual Item Amounts
In the preceding paragraphs, I describe how you can take an estimate and 
create an invoice by using that estimate as a starting point. I also say that 
you can edit the numbers that come off the estimate. Now, here’s an inter-
esting job-costing point: QuickBooks prints reports — like the one shown in 
Figure 16-4 — that let you compare the item estimates shown on the original 
estimates with the actual billed items shown on invoices.
 
Figure 16-4: 
An Item 
Estimates 
vs. Actuals 
report.
 

282
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
To produce such a report, choose Report Center➪Jobs, Time & Mileage➪
Item Estimates vs. Actuals. QuickBooks displays a report that lets you com-
pare estimated amounts with invoiced amounts. If you bid jobs by using esti-
mates but must invoice with actual numbers, such a report is a great way to 
see how good of a job you’re doing in your estimating.
Charging for Actual Time and Costs
If you charge a customer for actual costs and hours, you need to track the 
costs and time when you incur the charges for them. You assign the cost to 
the job by entering the customer and job information into the Customer:Job 
column that’s shown in the form window used to record a particular cost or 
time charge. For example, if you use the Enter Bills window (see Chapter 6) 
to record a bill for a particular job, you use the Customer:Job column to des-
ignate the job.
To charge a customer for costs or time that you recorded, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Customers➪Create Invoices to open the Create Invoices 
window.
 
2. Change the name in the Customer:Job drop-down list to the proper 
customer.
 
 This step is easy: Activate the drop-down list, and choose the appropri-
ate customer and job. If you have assigned time or costs to this cus-
tomer, a screen pops up, asking you to click the Time/Costs button to 
include the charges in your invoice.
 
3. Click the Add Time/Costs button.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. The 
dialog box already shows the costs and time charges that you assigned 
to this customer and job combination.
 
4. Select the billable time and costs that you want to add to the invoice.
 
 Check the time charges and costs that you want to bill for. Note that the 
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box provides different tabs for 
Items, Expenses, and Mileage.
 
5. (Optional, Expenses only) Indicate the markup.
 
 The Expenses tab has a couple of extra fields at the top of the tab to 
indicate the Markup Amount or % and the Markup Account. If applica-
ble, fill in the fields with the appropriate information.

283
 Chapter 16: Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking
 
6. (Optional) Indicate whether you want the charges to appear as a 
single item on the invoice.
 
 If you want to avoid listing the gory details of the charges to your cus-
tomer, check the Print Selected Time and Costs As One Invoice Item 
check box located in the bottom-left corner of the invoice.
 
7. Click OK.
 
 After you have everything the way you want it, click OK. As if by magic — 
even if it was by your hard work and the sweat of your own brow — the 
invoice appears.
 
8. (Optional) Add anything else you want to include on the invoice.
 
 This invoice is a regular QuickBooks invoice, remember? You may want 
to click the down arrow beside the Print button and choose Preview 
from the drop-down list to make sure that only the job costs that you 
want to appear do appear.
 
9. Click Save & New or Save & Close.
 
 That’s how you record the invoice.
After you record the invoice, the job costs that have been billed are removed 
from the Choose Billable Time and Costs window. You’re finished. Breathe 
easier.
 
You can also track the amount of time that you or other employees spend 
on clients or customers. To turn on time tracking, choose Edit➪Preferences, 
scroll down to and click the Time Tracking icon, and then select the Time 
Tracking Yes radio button. After you do this, you can track the time that you 
spend on a client or customer by choosing Customers➪Enter Time➪Use 
Weekly Timesheet or Customers➪Enter Time➪Time/Enter Single Activity. 
Either command displays an easy-to-understand window that lets you record 
time spent on a particular client or customer.
And a final important point: The time-tracker clock keeps ticking as long as 
the QuickBooks program runs. The program doesn’t need to be the active 
Windows program to continue working. (I mention this because in some 
older versions of QuickBooks, the timer stops if you start working with 
another program, such as your word processor or e-mail program.)

Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Tracking Job Costs
To see the costs assigned or allocated to a project, use the Job, Time & Mileage 
Reports, which are available when you choose Reports➪Jobs, Time & Mileage. 
You can experiment with the different reports to see which provides the infor-
mation in a format and at a level of detail that works best for you. For example, 
if you’re invoicing customers by job and collecting cost data by customer and 
job, you can produce great job-profitability reports that show what you’ve 
made by job. Also note that you can budget amounts by customer and job 
(using the same budgeting technique described in Chapter 12). If you do the 
extra work of budgeting by customer job, you can also compare actual job rev-
enues and costs with budgeted job revenues and costs.

O
kay, you don’t need to worry about the data files that QuickBooks 
stores your financial information in. Pretty much, QuickBooks does all 
the dirty work. But that said, you do have a few housekeeping tasks to take 
care of. In this chapter, I describe these chores and how to do them correctly 
with minimal hassle.
Backing Up Is (Not That) Hard to Do
Sure, I can give you some tricky, technical examples of fancy backup strate-
gies, but they have no point here. You want to know the basics, right?
 
The guiding rule is that you back up anytime you work on something that you 
wouldn’t want to redo. Some people think that a week’s worth of work is negli-
gible, and others think that a month’s worth of work is negligible.
So here’s what I do to back up my files. I back up every week after I enter my 
data for the week. Then I stick the disk (you might use any removable disc, 
such as a USB flash drive, a Zip disk or writable CD) in my briefcase so that 
if something terrible happens (like a meteor hitting my office building), I 
don’t lose both my computer and the backup disk with the data. (I carry my 
briefcase around with me — a sort of middle-age security blanket — so that it 
won’t get destroyed in some after-hours disaster.)

286
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Sounds like a pretty good system, huh? Actually, I admit that my strategy has 
its problems:
 
 Because I back up weekly, I might have to re-enter as much as a week’s 
worth of data if the computer crashes toward the end of the week. In 
my case, I wouldn’t lose all that much work. However, if you’re someone 
with heavy transaction volumes — if you prepare hundreds of invoices 
or write hundreds of checks each week, for example — you probably 
want to back up more frequently, perhaps every day.
 
 A second problem with my strategy is only remotely possible but still 
worth mentioning: If something bad does happen to the QuickBooks files 
stored on my computer’s hard drive as well as the files stored on the 
backup floppy disk, CD-R, CD-RW, or Zip disk, I’ll be up the proverbial 
creek without a paddle. (I should also note that a removable disk — 
especially a floppy — is far more likely to fail than a hard drive.) If this 
worst-case scenario actually occurs, I’ll need to start over from scratch 
from the beginning of the year.
Some people who are religiously careful circulate three sets of backup disks 
to reduce the chance of this mishap. They also regularly move one copy off-
site, such as to a safe deposit box. In this scenario, whenever you back up 
your data, you overwrite the oldest set of backup disks.
Say you back up your data every week, and your hard drive not only crashes, 
but also bursts into a ball of flames rising high into the night. To restore your 
files, you use the most recent set of backups — one-week old, max. If some-
thing is wrong with those, you use the next–most-recent set — two weeks 
old. If something is wrong with those, you use the last set — three weeks old. 
This way, you have three chances to get a set that works — a nice bit of secu-
rity for the cost of a few extra disks or storage devices.
 
If you can’t fit your backup QuickBooks file on a single floppy and you want to 
use floppy disks, you can back up across multiple floppies. The program asks 
for additional floppies as it needs them to complete the Backup process.
Backing up the quick-and-dirty way
You’re busy. You don’t have time to fool around. You just want to do a pass-
able job of backing up, and you decided how often you plan to do it. Sound 
like your situation? Then follow these steps:
 
1. Insert a blank disk/disc into the appropriate drive.

287
 Chapter 17: File Management Tips
 
 You can back up to any removable disk, including flash memory devices, 
floppy disks, Zip disks, and writable CDs. However, note that Intuit 
(the maker of QuickBooks) now recommends that you not use the 
QuickBooks backup command to move a backup file onto a CD. Instead, 
Intuit recommends you back up the file onto your hard drive and then 
use the Windows File Copy command to burn the file onto the disc. This 
workaround approach tends to solve some of the CD-writing problems 
people experience when backing up directly to a CD.
 
 Heck, I should admit that you can back up to any fixed disk, such as your 
hard drive or a network disk, but the advantage of a removable disk is 
that you can store it in some other location. As a compromise, you can 
also use a network disk. You typically don’t want to use your hard drive 
(although this is better than nothing) because one of the disasters that 
might befall your QuickBooks data is a hard drive failure.
 
 You can also back up your QuickBooks files to an online storage area. 
See the sidebar “Backing up files online” for more information.
 
2. If you store data for more than one company, make sure that the com-
pany whose data you want to back up is the active company.
 
 Yes, I know that all your companies are active; I’m hoping they’re not 
dead in the water. My point is that you want to back up the right com-
pany. To find out whether the right company is active, just look at the 
QuickBooks application window title bar, which names the active com-
pany. (If you don’t remember setting up multiple files, don’t worry. You 
probably have only one file — the usual case.)
 
3. Choose File➪Save Copy or Back Up to begin the backup operation.
 
 QuickBooks displays the first Backup Wizard dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 17-1.
 
Figure 17-1: 
The first 
Backup 
Wizard dia-
log box.
 

288
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
 If you use QuickBooks in multi-user mode, you need to switch to single-
user mode before you back up your file. For more information on how to 
make this switch, see Appendix C.
 
4. Tell QuickBooks that you want to back up the QuickBooks data file.
 
 When QuickBooks displays the first Save Copy or Backup wizard dialog 
box — the one shown in Figure 17-1 — select the Backup Copy radio 
button and then click Next. QuickBooks displays the second Backup 
Wizard dialog box (not shown) that asks you to specify the location for 
the backup.
 
5. Indicate whether you want to backup on a local storage device or 
online.
 
 To backup your QuickBooks file locally — this is my recommendation, 
but do see the upcoming sidebar on backing up file online — select the 
Local Backup option.
 
6. Describe how QuickBooks should back up your data file.
 
 With the second Save Copy or Backup wizard dialog box displayed, click 
the Options button. QuickBooks displays the Backup Options dialog box 
(see Figure 17-2), from which you specify how and when QuickBooks 
backs up your data file:
 
• Pick a default location. Specify where the backup file should be 
located. You can do this either by entering the pathname of the 
backup folder in the Tell Us Where to Save Your Backup Copies 
box (the hard way) or by clicking the Browse button and then 
using the Browse for Folder dialog box that Windows displays to 
pick a default backup location.
 
Figure 17-2: 
The Backup 
Options dia-
log box.
 

289
 Chapter 17: File Management Tips
 
• Fine-tune the backup operation. The Backup Options dialog box 
provides a couple of check boxes that you can use to fine-tune the 
old QuickBooks backup operation. The Add the Date and Time 
of Backup to the File Name check box, if checked, does just what 
it says. The Limit the Number of Backup Copies in this Folder 
tells QuickBooks to limit the number of backup copies of your 
QuickBooks file it stores in the backup folder. The default number 
of backup copies kept on hand is 3; that should be fine.
 
• Specify the backup reminder rule. You can select the Remind Me to 
Back Up When I Close My Company File Every [X] Times text box 
to tell QuickBooks it should remind you every so often to back up. 
By default, QuickBooks reminds you every fourth time you close 
a data file, but you can replace the value in the text box to specify 
some other backup reminder frequency.
 
• Select a data verification option. QuickBooks provides three data 
verification options, which appear as radio buttons on the Backup 
Options dialog box (refer to Figure 17-2). You can select the 
button that corresponds to the data verification method you want: 
Complete Verification (safe but slow), Quicker Verification (fast 
but not as thorough), and No Verification (saves you a bit of time 
now at the risk of huge problems later). The Complete Verification 
option is what QuickBooks and I both recommend.
 
 When you finish with the Backup Options dialog box, click OK. 
QuickBooks returns to the second Backup Wizard dialog box.
 
7. Describe when QuickBooks should back up your data file.
 
 To continue, click Next. QuickBooks displays the third Backup Wizard 
dialog box (see Figure 17-3). The third Backup Wizard dialog box pro-
vides radio buttons that you use to schedule when you want to back up. 
For example, to indicate that you want to back up on the spot, select the 
Save It Now radio button.
 
Figure 17-3: 
The third 
Backup 
Wizard 
dialog box.
 

290
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
8. Confirm the backup file location and name.
 
 With the third Backup Wizard dialog box displayed (refer to Figure 17-3), 
click Next. QuickBooks displays the Save Backup Copy dialog box (see 
Figure 17-4). If you successfully completed Step 6, you already specified 
the appropriate folder location for the backup file. Just to be on the safe 
side, confirm that the filename and folder location shown in the Save 
Backup Copy dialog box is correct. If the folder location isn’t correct, 
select a new folder location from the Save In drop-down list. If the file-
name isn’t correct, edit the name shown in the File Name text box.
 
Figure 17-4: 
The Save 
Backup 
Copy 
dialog box.
 
 
9. Click Save.
 
 QuickBooks backs up your data file and displays a message box that 
tells you it’s backed up your file. The message also gives the backup file-
name and folder location.
Getting back the QuickBooks 
data you backed up
What happens if you lose all your QuickBooks data? First of all, I encourage you 
to feel smug. Get a cup of coffee. Lean back in your chair. Gloat for a couple of 
minutes. You, my friend, have no problem. You have followed instructions.
 
Okay, you may have one or two problems, but you can probably blame PC 
gremlins for those. If the disaster that caused you to lose your data also 
trashed other parts of your computer, you may need to reinstall QuickBooks. 
You also may need to reinstall all your other software.

291
 Chapter 17: File Management Tips
After you gloat sufficiently (and piece your computer back together again if 
it was the cause of the disaster), carefully do the following to reinstate your 
QuickBooks data:
 
1. Get your backup disk.
 
 Find the backup disk you created and carefully insert it into the appro-
priate disk drive.
 
2. Start QuickBooks and choose File➪Open or Restore Company.
 
 QuickBooks closes whatever company file you have open. QuickBooks 
displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box (see Figure 17-5).
 
3. Indicate that you want to restore a backup copy of your QuickBooks 
data file.
 
 How you do this is probably obvious, right? Select the option button 
labeled Restore a Backup Copy.
 
4. Tell QuickBooks whether you backed up locally or online.
 
 Click Next to continue. QuickBooks displays the Restore Backup: 
Method dialog box (not shown). Select the Local Backup radio button to 
indicate that you made a local backup.
Backing up files online
You can quickly and easily back up your data 
online. If you do so, you no longer need to 
remember to make backups and take them 
off-site. To find out more about online backup, 
choose File➪Save Copy or Backup; indicate 
that you want to back up the QuickBooks data 
file. When QuickBooks displays the second 
Backup Wizard dialog box, click the Learn More 
about QuickBooks Online link.
The Online Backup service is a pretty darn good 
idea if you have a fast Internet connection, but 
the service does cost a little bit of money. You 
pay at least $50 yearly and as much as $150 
yearly, depending on the level of service, but 
you can set up the service so that QuickBooks 
automatically backs up your data and even 
other important files on a regular basis. I think 
this is pretty cool.
Two final points about using the QuickBooks 
online backup option. First, and just for the 
record, I don’t think you need to worry about 
security. (You can read more about the security 
measures at the QuickBooks Web site, but your 
data is as secure online as it is in your office.) 
Second, I think most of us should use the ser-
vice. I’m using it. Online offsite backup at the 
prices that Intuit offers seems like an excellent 
deal for any business where the QuickBooks 
data file is important.

or Restore 
Company 
dialog box.
 
 
5. Identify the backup file that you want to use.
 
 Click Next to continue. QuickBooks displays the Open Backup Copy 
dialog box (see Figure 17-6). If you know the company filename and 
location, you can enter this information in the boxes provided. If you 
don’t know this information, use the Look In drop-down list to identify 
the drive that contains the file you want to back up. Then choose the 
backup file you want to restore and click Open. QuickBooks displays the 
Restore Backup: To Location dialog box (not shown).
 
Figure 17-6: 
The Open 
Backup 
Copy dialog 
box.
 
 
6. Specify where the restored file will be located.
 
 Click Next again. QuickBooks displays the Save Company File As dialog 
box (see Figure 17-7). Use the File Name text box and Save In drop-down 
list in the Save Company File As dialog box to identify the file you want 
to replace.

293
 Chapter 17: File Management Tips
 
 If you know the company filename and location, you can enter this infor-
mation in the text boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, 
use the Save In drop-down list to make sure that you place the restored 
file in the correct folder on the correct drive.
 
Figure 17-7: 
The Save 
Company 
File As 
dialog box.
 
 
7. Click Save.
 
 If the file you’re trying to restore already exists, you see a message box 
telling you so. Click Yes to overwrite and replace the file with the one 
stored on the backup disk, or click No to keep the original copy.
QuickBooks may ask you for your password to verify that you have adminis-
trative permission to restore the file. Then, if everything goes okay, you see a 
message box that says so. Breathe a deep sigh of relief, and give thanks.
 
Oops. I almost forgot:
 
 When you restore a file, you replace the current version of the file with 
the backup version stored on the backup disk. Don’t restore a file for 
fun. Restore a file only if the current version is trashed and you want to 
start over by using the version stored on the backup disk.
 
 You need to re-enter everything you entered since you made the backup 
copy. I know. You’re bummed out. Hopefully, it hasn’t been all that long 
since you backed up.

294
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Accountant’s Copy
Hey. While I’m on the subject of the housecleaning stuff that you can do with 
your QuickBooks files, let me mention the Accountant’s Copy feature.
Accountant’s Copy allows your accountant to make adjustments in a special 
copy of your QuickBooks data file while you continue to enter your daily 
transactions in the master file. When your accountant returns the updated 
file, you can merge the changes back into the master file.
To use Accountant’s Copy, choose File➪Save Copy or Backup. Select the 
Create a File to Send to Your Accountant option and then follow the on-
screen instructions. You will be able to import the accountant’s changes 
later. If you need help with this feature, you should talk to your accountant.
 
You should never upgrade to a newer version of QuickBooks while your 
accountant is still working with the accountant’s copy. Or, at least you 
shouldn’t do this if you plan on using the accountant’s changes. If an active 
accountant’s copy is in use, your screen will state that at the very top, next to 
the company name.
Working with Portable Files
QuickBooks includes a portable-files feature. A portable file is a smaller, con-
densed version of the QuickBooks data file. The portable file is small enough, 
in fact, that you can probably e-mail it to your accountant, your sister in 
Portland, or me.
To create a portable file, choose File➪Save Copy or Backup. When 
QuickBooks displays the first Backup Wizard dialog box (refer to Figure 17-1), 
select the Portable Company File radio button, click Next, and then follow 
the on-screen instructions. The process, by the way, resembles the backup 
process described earlier in this chapter. I find it easy to save the file on the 
desktop. Then you can attach it easily to your e-mail and send it out. After 
the other party receives the file, you can just drag your copy to the Recycle 
Bin. Your real file remains intact.
To open a portable file, a person (this could be your accountant, your sister 
in Portland, or me) should choose File➪Open or Restore Company. When 
QuickBooks displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box (refer to 
Figure 17-5), this other person just specifies the file that he or she wants to 
open as a portable file and then follows the on-screen instructions.

295
 Chapter 17: File Management Tips
Using an Audit Trail
For some curious reason, in the post-Enron world of accounting, people are 
much more interested in the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature. In fact, some 
readers of past editions of this book have tracked me down as though I were 
a wounded animal so that they could ask about audit trails in QuickBooks. 
Because of this renewed interest, let me share the three things you need to 
know about using the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature:
 
 An audit trail is simply a list of changes. The QuickBooks Audit Trail — 
which is a simple report that lists the changes to the QuickBooks data 
file — lets you see who changed what.
 
 To turn on QuickBooks’ Audit Trail feature in old versions of 
QuickBooks, you had to choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting 
icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then check the Use Audit 
Trail check box. However, in QuickBooks 2006 and later versions, you 
don’t have to turn on the Audit Trail feature. It’s always on, baby.
 
 You can print the Audit Trail report by choosing Reports➪Accountant & 
Taxes➪Audit Trail.
Using a Closing Password
QuickBooks doesn’t require you to or even let you “close” months and 
years, the way old manual accounting systems did. (When you “closed” an 
old accounting period, you actually zeroed-out the revenue and expense 
accounts, and transferred the net amount to the owner’s equity accounts.)
However, QuickBooks does let you use a closing date and password. The 
closing date sort of prevents someone from entering transactions earlier than 
the specified date. If you set a closing password, for example, someone needs 
to supply that password before entering a transaction or changing a transac-
tion dated before the closing date. If you don’t set a closing password, some-
one trying to enter or change a transaction dated before the closing date is 
warned, but he or she can still create or change the entry.
To set a closing date, choose Edit➪Preferences, click the Accounting icon, 
click the Company Preferences tab, click the Set Date/Password button, and 
then enter the closing date (probably the end of the most recently completed 
year) and password.

Chapter 18
Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
In This Chapter
 Discovering fixed asset accounting
 Finding out about fixed asset accounting in QuickBooks
 Setting up a Fixed Asset list
 Tracking vehicle mileage
I
n this chapter, I cover two specialty topics of modest interest to a small 
handful of business owners: how the QuickBooks Fixed Asset list works 
and how the QuickBooks vehicle mileage-tracking tool works.
Let me say at the outset that you may not need these tools. QuickBooks 
users commonly think that the tools do more than they really do. In some 
situations, though, business owners and accountants truly do find these two 
simple tools helpful.
But you know what? I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the start.
What Is Fixed Asset Accounting?
So that you understand where the Fixed Asset list and vehicle mileage tracker 
fit into the scheme of things, let me begin by defining the term fixed asset and 
explaining just what fixed asset accounting is.
The term fixed asset historically refers to an asset that is fixed in place. For 
example, a factory or building set into concrete is fixed. Likewise, a 20-ton 
piece of machinery bolted into the floor is also fixed.
In the context of QuickBooks and its Fixed Asset list, fixed assets also include 
items such as furniture, equipment, and vehicles — things that aren’t so 
“fixed” but instead are assets that last a long time – that a business, there-
fore, must depreciate.

298
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
Now that you know what a fixed asset is — at least according to Steve Nelson — 
let me define the term fixed asset accounting. Fixed asset accounting, I’m going to 
say, refers to three accounting tasks:
 
 Track your fixed assets’ costs, descriptions, and other relevant informa-
tion so that you can take proper care of your stuff
 
 Calculate and recording fixed assets’ depreciation so that tax returns 
and financial statements can be prepared
 
 Calculate and recording the effect, including the gain or loss, stemming 
from the disposal of fixed assets so that tax returns and financial state-
ments can be prepared
Obviously, this fixed asset accounting stuff is important, but let me throw 
you a curveball. I’m not sure you need to worry about this stuff.
Now, of course, you want to keep track of fixed assets so that you know 
what you own. This stuff-you-own information is pretty essential for thinking 
smartly about how much insurance you should purchase, for example. You 
may also pay property taxes on this stuff, so that’s another good reason to 
truly know what you have.
And ditto on your need to be able to depreciate your fixed assets and to 
keep track of what happens when you sell a fixed asset. Shoot, you don’t 
have to be in business more than about a year before you know that tax laws 
and generally accepted accounting principles say that you have to do this, 
regardless of whether you want to.
But here’s my lazy-boy thinking. You know your accountant? The woman 
or man who does your taxes? She or he is already keeping such a list to cal-
culate the correct amount of depreciation that you should enter onto your 
income tax returns. This makes me wonder why you need to maintain a 
second, duplicate list.
To me, you need to do the fixed asset accounting yourself in only two 
situations — because you
 
 Have so much stuff that your poor accountant needs or would benefit 
from help in tracking the stuff: This will be the case if you have hun-
dreds or thousands of items.
 
 Don’t use an outside accountant: You, therefore, are yourself the poor 
sap who has to do this fixed accounting work.
Hopefully, most readers will just be able to quit their reading at this point. 
Most readers now realize that their accountants are almost certainly already 
doing their fixed asset accounting work. Most readers, in fact, will realize that 
they don’t even need to worry about noodling around with the QuickBooks 
Fixed Asset list!

299
 Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
However, be cautious here. Perhaps a quick telephone call to your accoun-
tant can confirm that your fixed asset accounting is already being performed. 
Another way to check this is to look carefully at last year’s tax return. Do 
you see, buried somewhere near the back of the return, a listing of your fixed 
assets? If so, skip this chapter.
If you realize that you need to handle the fixed asset accounting yourself, 
keep reading.
Fixed Asset Accounting in QuickBooks
Fixed asset accounting consists of three tasks:
 
 Keep a list of the assets you own.
 
 Record depreciation on any depreciable assets.
 
 Record the disposal of an asset, including any gain or loss on disposal.
The Fixed Asset list, which I describe in the next section, takes care of the 
first task. The Fixed Asset list doesn’t directly help you with the second or 
third tasks shown in the preceding list, though. You need to understand this 
important point. You still need to calculate and then enter asset depreciation 
yourself. And when you dispose of an asset, you still need to construct a jour-
nal entry that records the disposition.
 
Chapter 20 describes how depreciation works and how you go about recording 
the disposal of an asset. Read that chapter if you want to know how that stuff 
works.
Setting Up a Fixed Asset List
As noted earlier in the chapter, if your business owns a lot of stuff with long-
lasting value, either you or your accountant needs to keep track of the items. 
If you need to track the items, you can do so by using the Fixed Asset list.
Adding items to the Fixed Asset list
To add a piece of furniture, some bit of equipment or machinery, or another 
item of long-lived value to the Fixed Asset list, follow these steps:

300
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
1. Display the Fixed Asset list.
 
 To display the Fixed Asset list, choose Lists➪Fixed Asset Item List. 
QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window, as shown in 
Figure 18-1. Initially, because you haven’t yet added any assets, the list 
shows no assets.
 
 Have assets you’ve already purchased? You can edit the original pur-
chase transaction and add the fixed asset to the list during editing.
 
Figure 18-1: 
The Fixed 
Asset Item 
List window.
 
 
2. Tell QuickBooks that you want to add an item to the Fixed Asset list.
 
 Click the Item button and then choose New from the menu that 
QuickBooks displays. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as 
shown in Figure 18-2.
 
3. Name the asset.
 
 Give the asset a unique name. For example, you might give a piece of 
furniture a name like Leather couch, a computer a name like HP Pavilion, 
and a vehicle a name like ’02 Chevy S20 Pickup.

301
 Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
 
Figure 18-2: 
The New 
Item 
window.
 
 
4. Select the appropriate fixed asset account.
 
 From the Asset Account drop-down list, select the fixed asset account 
in which the asset you’re describing should be placed. A leather couch 
used in your opulent reception area, for example, should probably be 
placed in a furniture fixed asset account. A piece of machinery should 
probably be placed in an equipment fixed asset account.
 
 QuickBooks, as you might guess, supplies a bunch of accounts automati-
cally, but you may not see the account you need or want in the Asset 
Account drop-down list. You can add a new asset account on the fly, 
so to speak, by entering a new account name and pressing Enter. When 
QuickBooks sees that the fixed asset account isn’t yet set up, it prompts 
you to set up the new fixed asset account.
 
5. Describe the purchase terms.
 
 Use the Purchase Information area to describe the item that you pur-
chased and the purchase terms. For example, you want to indicate 
whether the item is new or used by marking the New or Used radio 
button. You can provide a purchase description, purchase date, 
purchase cost, and even identify the vendor by using the other, self-
explanatory boxes in the Purchase Information area.

302
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
6. (Optional) Describe the asset in further detail.
 
 The Asset Information area at the bottom of the New Item window provides 
additional text boxes that you can use to describe the asset. The area pro-
vides a humongous field in which to place a lengthy asset description, for 
example. You also have fields you can use to identify the asset location, the 
original purchase order (PO) number, the asset’s serial number, and the 
warranty expiration date. If these fields aren’t adequate, heck, QuickBooks 
even supplies a Notes area that you can use to write a small ode to your 
asset or record some other bit of relevant asset information.
 
7. Save the asset item description.
 
 You can click OK to simultaneously save the new asset item description 
and close the New Item window. Alternatively, you can click Next to save 
the new asset item description but leave the New Item window displayed.
Adding fixed asset items on the fly
You can add items to the Fixed Asset list as described in the preceding para-
graphs. Alternatively, you can add an item to the Fixed Asset list when you 
record the bill that records the vendor invoice for the asset or when you 
record the check that pays the vendor invoice for the asset.
Here’s how this works: If you told QuickBooks that you want to maintain a Fixed 
Asset list, QuickBooks prompts you to add a fixed asset item when you catego-
rize, or debit, a fixed asset account while entering a bill or recording a check.
To collect the information required to set up the fixed asset item, QuickBooks 
displays the same New Item window (refer to Figure 18-2). The steps that I 
provide in the preceding section for filling in the New Item window also work 
when adding fixed asset items on the fly.
Editing items on the Fixed Asset list
To edit a fixed asset item, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Lists➪Fixed Asset Item List
 
 QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window. (Refer to
 Figure 18-1.)
 
2. Double-click the item that you want to edit.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Edit Item window, as shown in Figure 18-3.

303
 Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
 
Figure 18-3: 
The Edit 
Item 
window.
 
 
3. Update the asset description.
 
 As necessary, update the information shown in the Purchase 
Information and the Asset Information areas. Note, too, that if you want 
to record the disposal of an asset, you can select the Item Is Sold check 
box. Then QuickBooks enables the Sales Information area’s text boxes. 
You can use these to identify the sales date, price, and amount of selling 
expenses.
 
QuickBooks doesn’t do any bookkeeping with the purchase and/or sales 
information shown on the New Item and Edit Item windows. For example, 
QuickBooks doesn’t add an asset to the balance sheet because you set up 
a fixed asset item. And QuickBooks won’t calculate the gain or loss on dis-
position of the asset because you enter sales information. You need to do 
that yourself — or have your accountant do that — by using either standard 
QuickBooks transactions or traditional journal entries. Read Chapter 6 for 
information on how to record a bill that stems from a vendor invoice and see 
Chapter 8 for information on how to record a check that pays for some asset. 
Peruse Chapter 20 for instructions on how to record depreciation and how to 
record asset dispositions.

Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks supplies a business vehicle-mileage tracker that you can use 
to track and tally business mileage. As you may already know, you need to 
know both your total miles and your business miles to validly deduct vehicle 
expenses on your tax return. (If you’re not sure how this works, you should 
probably confer with your tax advisor.)
Identifying your vehicles
By law, you’re required to track your mileage by vehicle. QuickBooks, accord-
ingly, provides a Vehicle list. To add items to the Vehicle list, follow these 
steps:
 
1. To display the Vehicle list, choose Lists➪Customer & Vendor Profile 
Lists➪Vehicle List.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List window, as shown in Figure 18-4. 
Initially, because you haven’t yet added any vehicles, the list shows no 
assets.
 
Figure 18-4: 
The Vehicle 
List window.
 

305
 Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
 
2. Click the Vehicle button (bottom-left corner) and choose New from the 
menu that QuickBooks displays.
 
 QuickBooks displays the New Vehicle window, as shown in Figure 18-5.
 
Figure 18-5: 
The New 
Vehicle 
window.
 
 
3. Enter a name for the vehicle in the Vehicle text box and enter a 
description of the vehicle in the Description text box.
 
 Identify the vehicle by its make and maybe the year of manufacture. I 
suppose if you’ve got a fleet of cars or trucks, you may want to provide 
more identifying information than this.
 
4. Save the vehicle description by clicking OK.
Recording vehicle miles
After you add your business vehicles to the Vehicle list, you record each trip 
by using the Enter Vehicle Mileage window. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Enter Vehicle Mileage window by choosing 
Company➪Enter Vehicle Mileage.
 
 QuickBooks displays the Enter Vehicle Mileage window, as shown in 
Figure 18-6.

306
Part IV: Housekeeping Chores 
 
Figure 18-6: 
The Enter 
Vehicle 
Mileage 
window.
 
 
2. Select the vehicle in which you took the trip from the Vehicle drop-
down list.
 
3. Provide the starting and ending dates of the trip.
 
 Enter the starting date of the trip in the Trip Start Date text box and the 
ending date of the trip in the Trip End Date text box. Note that you can 
click the little calendar button at the right end of these two text boxes to 
display the QuickBooks pop-up calendar.
 
4. Enter the starting mileage of the odometer into the Odometer Start 
box and the ending mileage of the odometer into the Odometer End 
box.
 
 After you enter the two mileage readings, QuickBooks calculates the 
total trip miles.
 
5. (Optional) Identify the customer and job.
 
 If the trip’s miles should be billed to or associated with a particular 
customer or job, select the customer or job from the Customer:Job 
drop-down list. For more information about how invoicing works, see 
Chapter 4.

307
 Chapter 18: Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists
 
6. (Optional) Associate the trip miles with a particular invoice item.
 
 If you bill the trip miles on an item, select from the Item drop-down list 
the invoice item that should be used. For more information about how 
invoice items work, see Chapter 4.
 
7. Provide additional information as necessary.
 
 Use the Notes text box to collect or store any additional information 
needed for the vehicle mileage record keeping.
 
8. Save the trip information by clicking the Save & Close button.
Using the vehicle reports
If you click the Reports button at the bottom of the Vehicle List window 
(refer to Figure 18-4), QuickBooks displays a menu that lists four different 
vehicle mileage reports: Mileage by Vehicle Summary, Mileage by Vehicle 
Detail, Mileage by Job Summary, and Mileage by Job Detail.
You can get to another menu of commands that produce these same reports 
by clicking the Mileage Reports button that appears at the top of the Enter 
Vehicle Mileage window (refer to Figure 18-6).
To produce a particular vehicle mileage report, choose one of the reports 
from either of these menus.
 
The reports are also available in the Job, Time, and Mileage sections of the 
Report Center and Reports menu.
Updating vehicle mileage rates
If you click the Mileage Rates button at the top of the Enter Vehicle Mileage 
window (refer to Figure 18-6), QuickBooks displays the Mileage Rates dialog 
box. The Mileage Rates dialog box lists Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mile-
age rates and their effective dates. You can enter a new mileage rate by click-
ing the next open row of the mileage rate schedule and then entering the 
effective date into the Effective Date column and the standard rate into the 
Rate column. You can find the current year’s business mileage rate at the IRS 
Web site at www.irs.gov.

f you run a business and you use QuickBooks, you need to know the infor-
mation in this chapter. You can get this information by sitting down with 
your certified public accountant (CPA) over a cup of coffee at $200 per hour. 
Or, you can read this chapter.
Sign All Your Own Checks
I have nothing against your bookkeeper. In a small business, however, 
people — especially full-charge bookkeepers — can bamboozle you too darn 
easily. By signing all the checks yourself, you keep your fingers on the pulse 
of your cash outflow.
Yeah, I know this practice can be a hassle. I know that you can’t easily spend 
three months in Hawaii. I know that you have to wade through paperwork 
every time you sign a stack of checks.
 
By the way, if you’re in a partnership, I think that you should have at least a 
couple of the partners co-sign checks.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Don’t Sign a Check the Wrong Way
If you sign many checks, you may be tempted to use a John Hancock–like 
signature. Although scrawling your name illegibly makes great sense when 
you’re autographing baseballs, don’t do it when you’re signing checks. A 
clear signature, especially one with a sense of personal style, is distinctive. A 
wavy line with a cross and a couple of dots is easy to forge.
Which leads me to my next tip. . . .
Review Canceled Checks before 
Your Bookkeeper Does
Be sure that you review your canceled checks before anybody else sees the 
monthly bank statement.
This chapter isn’t about browbeating bookkeepers. Still, a business owner 
can determine whether someone is forging signatures on checks only by 
being the first to open the bank statement and by reviewing each of the 
canceled-check signatures.
If you don’t examine the checks, unscrupulous employees — especially book-
keepers who can update the bank account records — can forge your signature 
with impunity. And they won’t get caught if they never overdraw the account.
I won’t continue this rant, but let me mention one last thing: Every time I teach 
CPAs about how to better help their clients with QuickBooks, I hear again and 
again about business owners who haven’t been careful about keeping an eye 
on the bookkeeper — and have suffered embezzlement and forgery as a result.
 
If you don’t follow these procedures, you — not the bank — will probably eat 
the losses.
Choose a Bookkeeper Who Is 
Familiar with Computers and 
Knows How to Do Payroll
Don’t worry. You don’t need to request an FBI background check.

313
 Chapter 19: (Almost) Ten Tips for Business Owners
In fact, if you use QuickBooks, you don’t need to hire people who are familiar 
with small business accounting systems. Just find people who know how to 
keep a checkbook and work with a computer. They shouldn’t have a problem 
understanding QuickBooks.
Of course, you don’t want someone who just fell off the turnip truck. But even 
if you do hire someone who rode into town on one, you’re not going to have 
much trouble getting that person up to speed with QuickBooks.
A bookkeeper who knows double-entry bookkeeping is super-helpful. But 
to be fair, such knowledge probably isn’t essential. I will say this, however: 
When you’re hiring, find someone who knows how to do payroll — and not 
just the federal payroll tax stuff (see Chapter 11), but also the state payroll 
tax monkey business.
Choose an Appropriate 
Accounting System
When you use QuickBooks, you use either cash-basis accounting or accrual-
basis accounting. (I describe the difference between these two methods in 
Appendix B.)
 
Cash-basis accounting is fine when a business’ cash inflow mirrors its sales 
and its cash outflow mirrors its expenses. This situation isn’t the case, how-
ever, in many businesses. A contractor of single-family homes, for example, 
may have cash coming in (by borrowing from banks) but may not make any 
money. Alternatively, a pawnshop owner who lends money at 22 percent 
might make scads of money, even if cash pours out of the business daily.
 
As a general rule, when you’re buying and selling inventory, accrual-basis 
accounting works better than cash-basis accounting. However, cash-basis 
accounting typically defers income taxes.
If QuickBooks Doesn’t Work 
for Your Business
QuickBooks is a great small business accounting program. In fact, I’d even go 
as far as to say that QuickBooks is probably the best small business account-
ing program available.
However, if QuickBooks doesn’t seem to fit your needs — if, for example, you 
need a program that works better for a manufacturer or that includes some 

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
special industry-specific feature — you may want one of the more compli-
cated (but also more powerful) small business accounting packages.
One possibility is the Enterprise version of QuickBooks, which costs more 
but also works for bigger businesses. The Enterprise version of QuickBooks 
looks and works almost identically to the “regular” versions of QuickBooks. 
If you know QuickBooks Premier, accordingly, you already know (or mostly 
know) QuickBooks Enterprise.)
If the Enterprise version of QuickBooks doesn’t work, you may want to talk to 
your accountant about industry-specific packages. (For example, if you’re a 
commercial printer, some vendor may have developed a special accounting 
package just for commercial printers.)
I’m amazed that PC accounting software remains so affordable. You can buy a 
great accounting package — one that you can use to manage a $5-million or a 
$25-million business — for a few hundred bucks. Accounting software is truly 
one of the great bargains in life.
Keep Things Simple
Let me share one last comment about managing small business financial 
affairs: Keep things as simple as possible. In fact, keep your business affairs 
simple enough that you can easily tell whether you’re making money and 
whether the business is healthy.
This advice may sound strange, but as a CPA, I’ve worked for some very 
bright people who have built monstrously complex financial structures for 
their businesses, including complicated leasing arrangements, labyrinthine 
partnership and corporate structures, and sophisticated profit-sharing and 
cost-sharing arrangements with other businesses.
 
I can only offer anecdotal evidence, of course, but I strongly believe that these 
supersophisticated financial arrangements don’t produce a profit when you 
consider all the costs. What’s more, these super-sophisticated arrangements 
almost always turn into management and record-keeping headaches.
Of course, the one positive thing you can say about such arrangements is 
this: You’ll make both your accountant and lawyer happy. And rich. So that’s 
good for them, at least.

Tricky Situations

A
s your business grows and becomes more complex, your account-
ing does, too. I can’t describe and discuss all the complexities you’ll 
encounter, but I can give you some tips on handling (just about) ten tricky 
situations.
 
In QuickBooks, you make journal entries by using the General Journal Entry 
window, which you get to by choosing Company➪Make Journal Entries. If you 
don’t understand double-entry bookkeeping but would like to, take a gander at 
Appendix B.
To track the depreciation of an asset that you already purchased (and added 
to the Chart of Accounts), you need two new accounts: a Fixed Asset type of 
account called something like Accumulated Depreciation and an Expense type 
account called something like Depreciation Expense.
 
If you have a large number of assets, keeping track of the accumulated depre-
ciation associated with specific assets is a good idea. You can do this either 
outside QuickBooks (for example, in an Excel spreadsheet or with your tax 
return) or inside QuickBooks (by using individual accounts for each asset’s 
original cost and accumulated depreciation).
After you set up these two accounts, you can record the asset depreciation 
with a journal entry, such as the following one that records $500 of deprecia-
tion expense:

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
$500
Accumulated depreciation
$500
 
The federal tax laws provide a special form of depreciation — Section 179 
depreciation — which enables you to depreciate the entire cost of some 
assets. This is a big break for small businesses. You can’t, however, use more 
than a certain amount of Section 179 depreciation in a year: $250,000 in 2008, 
for example. You also need to know some other nitty-gritty details, so confer 
with your tax advisor if you have questions.
Selling an Asset
When you sell an asset, you need to back out (get rid of) the asset’s account 
balance, record the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays you for the 
asset, and record any difference between what you sell the asset for and its 
value as a gain or loss.
 
If you purchase a piece of land for $5,000 but later resell it for $4,000, for 
example, you use the following journal entry to record the sale of this asset:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loss
$1,000
Asset
$5,000
 
You may need to set up another income account for the gain or another 
expense account for the loss. Read Chapter 2 for information on setting up 
new accounts.
Selling a Depreciable Asset
Selling a depreciable asset works almost identically to selling an asset that 
you haven’t been depreciating. When you sell the asset, you need to back 
out the asset’s account balance. You also need to back out the asset’s accu-
mulated depreciation (which is the only thing that’s different from selling an 
asset that you haven’t been depreciating). You need to record the cash (or 
whatever) that somebody pays you for the asset. Finally, you count as a gain 
or a loss any difference between what you sell the asset for and what its net-
of-accumulated-depreciation (also known as book value) is.

317
 Chapter 20: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations
 
This process sounds terribly complicated, but an example will help. Suppose 
that you purchased a $5,000 piece of machinery and have accumulated $500 
of depreciation thus far. Consequently, the asset account shows a $5,000 debit 
balance, and the asset’s accumulated depreciation account shows a $500 
credit balance. Suppose also that you sell the machinery for $4,750 in cash.
To record the sale of this depreciable asset, you would use the following 
journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,750
Accumulated depreciation
$500
Asset
$5,000
Gain
$250
 
As noted earlier in the chapter, if you have a bunch of assets, you probably 
want to set up individual accounts for each asset’s original cost and its accu-
mulated depreciation. The individual accounts make it much easier to make 
the journal entry shown in the preceding paragraph. Also, be sure to record 
the amount of that asset’s depreciation for the year of the sale before you 
make the entry for the sale itself.
Owner’s Equity in a Sole Proprietorship
Actually, tracking owner’s equity in a sole proprietorship is easy. You can 
use the single account that QuickBooks sets up for you, called Opening Bal 
Equity, to track what you’ve invested in the business. (You might want to 
rename this account something like Contributed Capital.)
 
To track the money you withdraw from the business, you can set up and use 
a new owner’s equity account called something like Owner’s Draws. Table 20-1 
gives an example of owner’s equity accounts in a sole proprietorship. Note 
that the numbers inside parentheses are negative values.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Owner’s Equity in a Partnership
To track the equity for each partner in a partnership, you need to create 
three accounts for each partner: one for the partner’s contributed capital, 
one for the partner’s draws, and one for the partner’s share of the distributed 
income.
Amounts that a partner withdraws, of course, get tracked with the partner’s 
draws account.
 
The partner’s share of the partnership’s profits gets allocated to the partner’s 
profit share account. (Your partnership agreement, by the way, should say 
how the partnership income is distributed between the partners.) Table 20-2 
gives an example of owner’s equity accounts in a partnership.

Owner’s Equity in a Corporation
Yikes! Accounting for the owner’s equity in a corporation can get mighty 
tricky mighty fast. In fact, I don’t mind telling you that college accounting 
textbooks often use several chapters to describe all the ins and outs of cor-
poration owner’s equity accounting.
As long as you keep things simple, however, you can probably use three or 
four accounts for your owner’s equity:
 
 A capital stock par value account, for which you get the par value 
amount by multiplying the par value per share by the number of 
shares issued. The par value of the stock is written on the face of the 
actual stock certificate, and it is stated in the corporate Articles of 
Incorporation.

319
 Chapter 20: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations
 
 A paid-in capital in excess of par value account for the amount inves-
tors paid for shares of stock in excess of par value. You get this amount 
by multiplying the price paid per share less the par value per share by 
the number of shares issued.
 
 A retained earnings account to track the business profits left invested 
in the business.
 
 A dividends paid account to track the amounts distributed to share-
holders in the current year.
Table 20-3 shows an example of owner’s equity accounts in a corporation.

Multiple-State Accounting
For multiple-state accounting, you can either use classes to track sales in 
each state or set up a Chart of Accounts that includes a complete set of 
income and expense accounts (and, if necessary, a complete set of asset and 
liability accounts) for each state. After you set up this Chart of Accounts, all 
you have to do is use the correct state’s income and expense accounts to 
record transactions.
If you do business in both Washington and Oregon, for example, you record 
sales in Oregon as Oregon sales and sales in Washington as Washington 
sales. You would treat other income accounts and all your expense accounts 
the same way. If you use class tracking for sales in different states, you don’t 
need duplicate accounts for each state.
A caution, however: If you want to use QuickBooks for multi-state account-
ing so you can do business tax returns for more than just your home state, 
confer with your tax advisor. What I’ve said here only scratches the surface 
of the subject. And there are some details (quite likely specific to your states 
of operation) that you want to hear about from a local expert).

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Getting a Loan
Getting a loan is the hard part. After you get the money, recording it in 
QuickBooks is easy. All you do is record a journal entry that increases cash 
and that recognizes the new loan liability. For example, if you get a $5,000 
loan, you might record the following journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$5,000
Loan payable
$5,000
 
You’ll already have a cash account set up, but you may need to set up a new 
liability account to track the loan.
Repaying a Loan
To record loan payments, you need to split each payment between two 
accounts: the interest expense account and the loan payable account.
 
Suppose that you’re making $75 monthly payments on a $5,000 loan. Also sup-
pose that the lender charges 1 percent interest each month. The following 
journal entry records the first month’s loan payment:
Debit
Credit
Explanation
Interest expense
$50
Calculated as 1 percent of $5,000
Loan payable
$25
The amount left over and applied 
to principal
Cash
$75
The total payment amount
The next month, of course, the loan balance is slightly less (because you 
made a $25 dent in the loan principal, as shown in the preceding loan pay-
ment journal entry). The following journal entry records the second month’s 
loan payment:
Debit
Credit
Explanation
Interest expense
$49.75

321
 Chapter 20: Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations
 
Get the lender to provide you an amortization schedule that shows the break-
down of each payment into interest expense and loan principal reduction. If 
this doesn’t work, choose Banking➪Loan Manager. QuickBooks displays the 
Loan Manager window. If you click the Add a Loan button, QuickBooks col-
lects a bit of information about the loan terms and builds an amortization 
schedule for you. Note, too, that you can tell QuickBooks to remind you of 
upcoming loan payments and even to schedule the payments.
 
You can record loan payments by using either the Write Checks window 
or the Enter Bills window. Just use the Expenses tab to specify the interest 
expense account and the loan liability account.

the world of finance.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The First “Most Expensive Money You 
Can Borrow” Formula
Here’s something you may not know: The most expensive money that you 
can borrow is from vendors who offer cash or early payment discounts that 
you don’t take. For example, perhaps your friendly office supply store offers 
a 2 percent discount if you pay cash at the time of purchase instead of paying 
within the usual 30 days. You don’t pay cash, so you pay the full amount 
(which is 2 percent more than the cash amount) 30 days later. In effect, you 
pay a 2 percent monthly interest charge. A 2 percent monthly interest charge 
works out to a 24 percent annual interest charge — and that’s a great deal of 
money.
 
Here’s another example that’s only slightly more complicated. Many, many 
vendors offer a 2 percent discount if you pay within the first 10 days that 
an invoice is due rather than 30 days later. (These payment terms are often 
described and printed at the bottom of the invoice as 2/10, Net 30.)
In this case, you pay 2 percent more by paying 20 days later. (The 20 days 
later is the difference between 10 days and 30 days.) Two percent for 20 days 
is roughly equivalent to 3 percent for 30 days (one month). So, a 2 percent, 
20-day interest charge works out to a 36 percent annual interest charge. Now 
you’re talking serious money.
Table 21-1 shows how some common early payment discounts (including 
cash discounts) translate into annual interest rates. By the way, I am a bit 
more precise in my calculations for this table, so these numbers vary slightly 
from (and are larger than) those given in the preceding paragraph.

Is it just me, or do those numbers blow you away? The 2 percent for 20 days 
early payment discount that you often see works out (if you do the math pre-
cisely) to more than 37 percent annual interest. Man, that hurts. And if you 
don’t take a 5-percent-for-20-days-early payment discount when it’s offered, 
you’re effectively borrowing money at an annual rate of 96 percent. You 
didn’t read that last number wrong. Yes, a 5-percent-for-20-days-early pay-
ment discount works out to an annual interest rate of almost 100 percent.
I want to make a couple more observations, too. Turning down a 1 percent 
discount for paying 30 days early isn’t actually a bad deal in many cases. 
Look at Table 21-1. It shows that the 1 percent discount for paying 30 days 
early results in 12.29 percent. Sure, that rate is pretty high, but that interest 
rate is less than for many credit cards and is less than for some small busi-
ness credit lines. If you have to borrow money some other way to pay 30 
days early, making an early payment might not be cost effective.
 
The bottom line on all this ranting is that early payment discounts, if not 
taken, represent one of the truly expensive ways to borrow money. I’m not 
saying that you won’t need to borrow money this way at times. I can guess 
that your cash flow gets pretty tight sometimes (a circumstance that is true 
in most businesses, as you probably know). I am saying, however, that you 
should never skip taking an early payment discount unless borrowing money 
at outrageous interest rates makes sense.
Oh, yes. The secret formula. To figure out the effective annual interest rate 
that you pay by not taking an early payment discount, use this formula:
Discount % / (1 – Discount %) × (365 / Number of Days of Early Payment)
To calculate the effective annual interest rate that you pay by not taking a 2 
percent discount for paying 20 days early, calculate this formula:
.02 / (1 – .02) × (365 / 20)
Work out the math, and you get 0.3724, which is the same thing as a 37.24 
percent interest rate. (Note that the discount percents are entered as their 
equivalent decimal values.)

The Second “Most Expensive Money 
You Can Borrow” Formula
You know that “most expensive money you can borrow” stuff that I talk 
about in the preceding section? The very tragic flip side to that story occurs 
when you offer your customers an early payment discount, and they take it. 
In effect, you borrow money from your customers at the same outrageous 
interest rates. For example, if customer Joe Schmoe gets a 2 percent early 
payment discount for paying 20 days early, you, in effect, pay ol’ Joe roughly 
2 percent interest for a 20-day loan. Using the same formula I give for the first 
“most expensive money you can borrow” formula, the rate works out to 37.24 
percent.
 
In some industries, customers expect early payment discounts. You may have 
to offer them, but you should never offer them willingly. You should never 
offer them just for fun. Borrowing money this way is just too expensive. A rate 
of 37.24 percent? Yikes!
 
Let me also offer a rather dour observation. In my experience, anytime some-
one offers big early payment discounts — I’ve seen them as big as 5 percent — 
he’s either stupid or desperate, and probably both.
The “How Do I Break Even?” Formula
I know that you’re not interested in just breaking even. I know that you want 
to make money in your business. But knowing what quantities you need to 
sell just to cover your expenses is often super-helpful. If you’re a one-person 
accounting firm (or some other service business), for example, how many 
hours do you need to work to pay your expenses and perhaps pay yourself a 
small salary? Or if you’re a retailer of, say, toys, how many toys do you need 
to sell to pay your overhead, rent, and sales clerks?
You see my point, right? Knowing how much revenue you need to generate 
just to stay in the game is essential. Knowing your break-even point enables 
you to establish a benchmark for your performance. (Any time you don’t 
break even, you know that you have a serious problem that you need to 
resolve quickly to stay in business.) And considering break-even points is 
invaluable when you think about new businesses or new ventures.

327
 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
 
As you ponder any new opportunity and its potential income and expenses, 
you need to know how much income you need to generate just to pay those 
expenses.
To calculate a break-even point, you need to know just three pieces of infor-
mation: your fixed costs (the expenses you have to pay regardless of the busi-
ness’s revenue, or income), the revenue that you generate for each sale, and 
the variable costs that you incur in each sale. (These variable costs, which 
also are called direct expenses, aren’t the same thing as the fixed costs.)
 
 Whatever you sell — be it thingamajigs, corporate jets, or hours of con-
sulting services — has a price. That price is your revenue per item input.
 
 Most of the time, what you sell has a cost, too. If you buy and resell 
thingamajigs, those thingamajigs cost you some amount of money. The 
total of your thingamajigs’ costs varies depending on how many thing-
amajigs you buy and sell, which is why these costs are referred to as 
variable costs. A couple of examples of variable costs include hourly (or 
contract) labor and shipping. Sometimes, the variable cost per item is 
zero, however. (If you’re a consultant, for example, you sell hours of 
your time, but you may not pay an hourly cost just because you consult 
for an hour.)
 
 Your fixed costs are all those costs that you pay regardless of whether 
you sell your product or service. For example, if you have to pay an 
employee a salary regardless of whether you sell anything, that salary is 
a fixed cost. Your rent is probably a fixed cost. Things like insurance and 
legal and accounting expenses are probably also fixed costs because 
they don’t vary with fluctuations in your revenue.
 
 Fixed costs may change a bit from year to year or bounce around a bit 
during a year. So maybe fixed isn’t a very good adjective. People use the 
term fixed costs, however, to differentiate these costs from variable costs, 
which are those costs that do vary with the number of goods you sell.
 
Take the book-writing business as an example. Suppose that as you read this 
book, you think, “Man, that guy is having too much fun. Writing about account-
ing programs, working day in and day out with buggy beta software — yeah, 
that would be the life.”
Further, suppose that for every book you write, you think that you can make 
$5,000, but you’ll probably end up paying about $1,000 per book for such 
things as long distance telephone charges, overnight courier charges, and 
extra hardware and software. And suppose that you need to pay yourself a 
salary of $20,000 per year. (In this scenario, your salary is your only fixed 
cost because you plan to write at home at a small desk in your bedroom.) 
Table 21-2 shows how the situation breaks down.

With these three bits of data, you can easily calculate how many books you 
need to write to break even. Here’s the formula:
Fixed Costs / (Revenue – Variable Costs)
If you plug in the writing business example data, the formula looks like this:
$20,000 / ($5,000 – $1,000)
Work through the math, and you get 5. So you need to write (and get paid 
for) five books per year to pay the $1,000 per book variable costs and your 
$20,000 salary. Just to prove that I didn’t make up this formula and that it 
really works, Table 21-3 shows how things look if you write five books.

Subtract the costs from the revenue, and 
nothing is left.
 
Accountants use parentheses to show negative numbers. That’s why the 
$5,000 and the $20,000 in Table 21-3 are in parentheses.
But back to the game. To break even in a book-writing business like the one 
that I describe here, you need to write and sell five books per year. If you 
don’t think that you can write and sell five books in a year, getting into the 
book-writing business makes no sense.
 
Your business is probably more complicated than book writing, but the same 
formula and logic for calculating your break-even point apply. You need just 
three pieces of information: the revenue that you receive from the sale of a 
single item, the variable costs of selling (and possibly making) the item, and 
the fixed costs that you pay just to be in business.

329
 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
QuickBooks doesn’t collect or present information in a way that enables 
you to easily pull the revenue per item and variable costs per item off some 
report. Neither does it provide a fixed-costs total on some report. However, if 
you understand the logic of the preceding discussion, you can easily massage 
the QuickBooks data to get the information you need.
The “You Can Grow Too Fast” Formula
Here’s a weird little paradox: One of the easiest ways for a small business to 
fail is by being too successful. I know. It sounds crazy, but it’s true. In fact, 
I’ll even go out on a limb and say that business success is by far the most 
common reason that I see for business failure.
“Oh, geez,” you say. “This nut is talking in circles.”
Let me explain. Whether or not you realize it, you need a certain amount of 
financial horsepower, or net worth, to do business. (Your net worth is just the 
difference between your assets and your liabilities.) You need to have some 
cash in the bank to tide you over the rough times that everybody has at least 
occasionally. You probably need to have some office furniture and comput-
ers so that you can take care of the business end of the business. And if you 
make anything at all, you need to have adequate tools and machinery. This 
part all makes sense, right?
How net worth relates to growth
Okay, now on to the next reality. If your business grows and continues to 
grow, you need to increase your financial horsepower, or net worth. A bigger 
business, for example, needs more cash to make it through the tough times 
than a smaller business does — along with more office furniture and comput-
ers, and more tools and machinery. Oh, sure, you might be able to have one 
growth spurt because you started with more financial horsepower (more net 
worth) than you needed. But — and this is the key part — you can’t sustain 
business growth without increasing your net worth. Now you may be saying 
things like “No way, man. That doesn’t apply to me.” I assure you, my new 
friend, that it does.
As long as your creditors will extend you additional credit as you grow your 
business — and they should, as long as the business is profitable and you 
don’t have cash flow problems — you can grow your business as fast as you 
can grow your net worth. If you can grow your net worth by 5 percent yearly, 
your business can grow at an easily sustained rate of only 5 percent per year. 
If you can grow your net worth by 50 percent yearly, your business can grow 
at an easily sustained rate of only (only?) 50 percent per year.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You grow your business’s net worth in only two ways:
 
 Reinvest profits in the business. Note that any profits that you leave in 
the business instead of drawing them out — such as through dividends 
or draws — are reinvested.
 
 Get people to invest money in the business. If you’re not in a position 
to continually raise money from new investors — and most small busi-
nesses aren’t — the only practical way to grow is by reinvesting profits 
in the business.
How to calculate sustainable growth
You can calculate the growth rate that your business can sustain by using 
this formula:
Reinvested Profits / Net Worth
 
I should say, just for the record, that this formula is a very simple sustainable 
growth formula. But even so, it offers some amazingly interesting insights. 
For example, perhaps you’re a commercial printer doing $500,000 in revenue 
yearly with a business net worth of $100,000; your business earns $50,000 per 
year, but you leave only $10,000 per year in the business. In other words, your 
reinvested profits are $10,000. In this case, your sustainable growth is calcu-
lated as follows:
$10,000 / $100,000
Work out the numbers, and you get 0.1, or 10 percent. In other words, you 
can grow your business by 10 percent yearly (as long as you grow the net 
worth by 10 percent per year by reinvesting profits). For example, you can 
easily go from $500,000 to $550,000 to $605,000 and continue growing annu-
ally at this 10 percent rate, but your business can’t grow any faster than 10 
percent per year. That is, you’ll get into serious trouble if you try to go from 
$500,000 to $600,000 to $720,000 and continue growing at 20 percent per year.
 
You can convert a decimal value to a percentage by multiplying the value by 
100. For example, 0.1 × 100 equals 10, so 0.1 equals 10 percent. You can con-
vert a percentage to a decimal value by dividing the value by 100. For example, 
25 (as in 25 percent) divided by 100 equals 0.25.
 
The sustainable-growth formula inputs are pretty easy to get after you have 
QuickBooks up and running. You can get the net worth figure off the balance 
sheet. You can calculate the reinvested profits by looking at the net income 
and deducting any amounts that you pulled out of the business.

331
 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
I’m not going to go through the mathematical proof of why this sustainable-
growth formula is true. My experience is that the formula makes intuitive 
sense to people who think about it for a few minutes. If you aren’t into the 
intuition thing or if you don’t believe me, get a college finance textbook, and 
look up its discussion of the sustainable-growth formula. Or do what all the 
kids today are doing — search online for “sustainable growth formula.”
The First “What Happens If . . . ?” 
Formula
One curiosity about small businesses is that small changes in revenue or 
income can have huge impacts on profits. A retailer who cruises along at 
$200,000 in revenue and struggles to live on $30,000 per year never realizes 
that boosting the sales volume by 20 percent to $250,000 might increase 
profits by 200 percent to $60,000.
 
If you take only one point away from this discussion, it should be this curious 
little truth: If fixed costs don’t change, small changes in revenue can produce 
big changes in profits.
 
The following example shows how this point works and provides a secret for-
mula. For starters, say that you currently generate $100,000 yearly in revenue 
and make $20,000 per year in profits. The revenue per item sold is $100, and 
the variable cost per item sold is $35. (In this case, the fixed costs happen to 
be $45,000 per year, but that figure isn’t all that important to the analysis.)
Accountants like to whip up little tables that describe these sorts of things, 
so Table 21-4 gives the current story on your imaginary business.
Table 21-4

Revenue
$100,000

Fixed costs

All the little things: rent, your salary, and so on.
Profits
$20,000
What’s left over.
Table 21-4 shows the current situation. Suppose that you want to know what 
will happen to your profits if revenue increases by 20 percent but your fixed 
costs don’t change. Mere mortals, not knowing what you and I know, might 
assume that a 20 percent increase in revenue would produce an approximate 
20 percent increase in profits. But you know that small changes in revenue 
can produce big changes in profits, right?

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
To estimate exactly how a change in revenue affects profits, use the following 
secret formula:
Percentage Change × Revenue × (1 – [Variable Cost per Item / Revenue 
per Item])
From the sample data provided in Table 21-4 (I’m sorry this example is start-
ing to resemble those story problems from eighth-grade math), you make the 
following calculation:
0.20 × $100,000 × (1 – [35 / 100])
Work out the numbers, and you get 13,000. What does this figure mean? It 
means that a 20 percent increase in revenue produces a $13,000 increase in 
profits. As a percentage of profits, this $13,000 increase is 65 percent:
$13,000 / $20,000 = 65 percent
Let me stop here and make a quick observation. In my experience, entrepre-
neurs always seem to think that they need to grow big to make big money. 
They concentrate on doing things that will double or triple or quadruple their 
sales. Their logic, though, isn’t always correct. If you can grow your business 
without having to increase your fixed costs, small changes in revenue can 
produce big changes in profits.
Before I stop talking about this first “What happens if . . . ?” formula, I want to 
quickly describe where you get the inputs you need for the formula:
 
 The percentage-change input is just a number that you pick. If you want 
to see what happens to your profits with a 25 percent increase in sales, 
for example, use 0.25.
 
 The revenue input is your total revenue. You can get it from your profit 
and loss statement. (In Chapter 15, I describe how you can create a 
profit and loss statement in QuickBooks.)
 
 The revenue per item sold and variable costs per item sold figures work the 
same way as I describe for the break-even formula earlier in this chapter.
The Second “What Happens If . . . ?” 
Formula
Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this, but people in finance (like me) usually have 
a prejudice against people in sales. And it’s not just because people who are 
good at sales usually make more money than people who are good at finance. 
It’s really not. Honest to goodness.

333
 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
Here’s the prejudice: People in finance think that people in sales always want 
to reduce prices.
People in sales see things a bit differently. They say, in effect, “Hey, you 
worry too much. We’ll make up the difference in additional sales volume.” 
The argument is appealing: You just undercut your competitor’s prices by a 
healthy chunk and make less on each sale. But because you sell your stuff so 
cheaply, your customers will beat a path to your door.
Just for the record, I love people who are good at sales. I think that someone 
who is good at sales is more important than someone who is good at finance.
But that painful admission aside, I have to tell you that I see a problem with 
the “Cut the prices; we’ll make it up with volume” strategy. If you cut prices 
by a given percentage — perhaps by 10 percent — you usually need a much 
bigger percentage gain in revenue to break even.
 
The following example shows what I mean and how this strategy works. 
Suppose that you have a business that sells some doohickey or thingamajig. 
You generate $100,000 yearly in revenue and make $20,000 per year in profits. 
Your revenue per item (or doohickey) sold is $100, and your variable cost per 
item (or doohickey) sold is $35. Your fixed costs happen to be $45,000 yearly, 
but again, the fixed costs aren’t all that important to the analysis. Table 21-5 
summarizes the current situation.

What’s left over.
Then business is particularly bad for one month. Joe-Bob, your sales guy, 
comes to you and says, “Boss, I have an idea. I think that we can cut prices by 
15 percent to $85 per doohickey and get a truly massive boost in sales.”
You’re a good boss. You’re a polite boss. Plus you’re intrigued. So you think 
a bit. The idea has a certain appeal. You start wondering how much of an 
increase in sales you need to break even on the price reduction.
You’re probably not surprised to read this, but I have another secret formula 
that can help. You can use the following formula to calculate how many items 
(doohickeys, in the example) you need to sell just to break even on the new, 
discounted price. Here’s the formula:

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
(Current Profits + Fixed Costs) / (Revenue per Item – Variable Cost per 
Item)
From the example data provided earlier, you make the following calculation:
($20,000 + $45,000) / ($85 – $35)
Work out the numbers, and you get 1,300. What does this figure mean? It 
means that just to break even on the $85 doohickey price, Joe-Bob needs to 
sell 1,300 doohickeys. Currently, per Table 21-3, Joe-Bob sells 1,000 doohick-
eys yearly. As a percentage, then, this jump from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,300 
doohickeys is exactly a 30 percent increase. (Remember that Joe-Bob pro-
poses a 15 percent price cut.)
 
Okay, I don’t know Joe-Bob. He may be a great guy. He may be a wonderful sales-
person. But here’s my guess: Joe-Bob isn’t thinking about a 30 percent increase 
in sales volume. (Remember, with a 15 percent price reduction, you need a 30 
percent increase just to break even!) And Joe-Bob almost certainly isn’t thinking 
about a 50 percent or 75 percent increase in sales volume — which is what you 
need to make money on the whole deal, as shown in Table 21-6.
Table 21-6 
Your Current Situation

Profits

$42,500
In summary, you can’t reduce prices by, say, 15 percent and then go for some 
penny-ante increase. You need huge increases in the sales volume to get 
big increases in profits. If you look at Table 21-6, you can see that if you can 
increase the sales from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,750 doohickeys — a 75 percent 
increase — you can more than double the profits. This increase assumes that 
the fixed costs stay level, as the table shows.
I want to describe quickly where you get the inputs that you need for the 
formula:
 
 The profit figure can come right off the QuickBooks profit and loss 
statement.
 
 The fixed costs figure just tallies all your fixed costs. (I talk about fixed 
costs earlier in this chapter in the section “The ‘How Do I Break Even?’ 
Formula.”

335
 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
 
 The revenue per item is just the new price that you’re considering.
 
 Finally, the variable cost per item is the cost of the thing you sell. (I 
discuss this cost earlier in the chapter, too.)
 
Please don’t construe the preceding discussion as proof that you should never 
listen to the Joe-Bobs of the world. The “cut prices to increase volume” strat-
egy can work wonderfully well. The trick, however, is to increase the sales 
volume massively. Sam Walton, the late founder of Wal-Mart, used the strategy 
and became, at one point, the richest man in the world.
The Economic Order Quantity 
(Isaac Newton) Formula
Isaac Newton invented differential calculus, a fact that is truly amazing to me. 
I can’t imagine how someone could just figure out calculus. I could never, in a 
hundred years, figure it out. But I’m getting off track.
The neat thing about calculus — besides the fact that I’m not going to do 
any for you here — is that it enables you to create optimal values equations. 
One of the coolest such equations is called the economic order quantity, or 
EOQ, model. I know that this stuff all sounds terribly confusing and totally 
boring, but stay with me for just another paragraph. (If you’re not satisfied in 
another paragraph or so, skip ahead to the next secret formula.)
 
Perhaps you buy and then resell — oh, I don’t know — 2,000 cases of vintage 
French wine every year. The EOQ model enables you to decide whether you 
should order all 2,000 cases at one time, order 1 case at a time, or order some 
number of cases in between 1 case and 2,000 cases.
 
Another way to say the same thing is that the EOQ model enables you to 
choose the best, or optimal, reorder quantity for items that you buy and then 
resell.
If you’re still with me at this point, I figure that you want to know how this 
formula works. You need to know just three pieces of data to calculate the 
optimal order quantity: the annual sales volume, the cost of placing an order, 
and the annual cost of holding one unit in inventory. You plug this informa-
tion into the following formula:
÷ (2 × Sales Volume × Order Cost) / Annual Holding Cost per Item

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You buy and resell 2,000 cases per year, so that amount is the sales volume. 
Every time you place an order for the wine, you need to buy an $800 round-
trip ticket to Paris (just to sample the inventory) and pay $200 for a couple 
of nights at a hotel. So your cost per order is $1,000. Finally, with insurance; 
interest on a bank loan; and the cost of maintaining your hermetically sealed, 
temperature-controlled wine cellar, the cost of storing a case of wine is about 
$100 yearly. In this example, you can calculate the optimal order quantity as 
follows:
÷ (2 × 2,000 × $1,000) / $100
Work through the numbers, and you get 200. Therefore, the order quan-
tity that minimizes the total cost of your trips to Paris and of holding your 
expensive wine inventory is 200 cases. You could, of course, make only one 
trip to Paris per year and buy 2,000 cases of wine at once, thereby saving 
travel money, but you would spend more money on holding your expensive 
wine inventory than you would save on travel costs. And although you could 
reduce your wine inventory carrying costs by going to Paris every week and 
picking up a few cases, your travel costs would go way, way up. (Of course, 
you would get about a billion frequent-flyer miles yearly.)
 
You can use the Standard view of the Windows Calculator to compute eco-
nomic order quantities. The trick is to click the ÷ (square root) key last. For 
example, to calculate the economic order quantity in the preceding example, 
you enter the following numbers and operators:
(2 × 2,000 × 1,000) / 100 = sqrt
The Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 isn’t exactly a secret formula. It’s more like a general rule. 
Usually, people use this rule to figure out how long it will take for some invest-
ment or savings account to double in value. The Rule of 72 is a cool little trick, 
however, and it has several useful applications for businesspeople.
What the rule says is that if you divide the value 72 by an interest rate per-
centage, your result is approximately the number of years it will take to 
double your money. For example, if you can stick money into some invest-
ment that pays 12 percent interest, it will take roughly six years to double 
your money because 72 / 12 = 6.
The Rule of 72 isn’t exact, but it’s usually close enough for government work. 
For example, if you invest $1,000 for 6 years at 12 percent interest, what you 
really get after 6 years isn’t $2,000 but $1,973.92.

 Chapter 21: (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas
If you’re in business, you can use the Rule of 72 for a couple other forecasts, too:
 
 To forecast how long it will take inflation to double the price of an 
item, divide 72 by the inflation rate. For example, if you own a build-
ing with a value that you figure will at least keep up with inflation, and 
you wonder how long the building will take to double in value if inflation 
runs at 4 percent, you just divide 72 by 4. The result is 18, meaning that 
it will take roughly 18 years for the building to double in value. Again, 
the Rule of 72 isn’t exactly on the money, but it’s dang close. A $100,000 
building increases in value to $202,581.65 over 18 years if the annual 
inflation rate is 4 percent.
 
 To forecast how long it will take to double sales volume, divide 72 by 
the given annual growth rate. For example, if you can grow your busi-
ness by, say, 9 percent per year, you will roughly double the size of the 
business in 8 years because 72 / 9 = 8. (I’m becoming kind of compulsive 
about this point, I know, but let me say again that the rule isn’t exact, 
but it’s very close. If a $1,000,000-per-year business grows 9 percent 
annually, its sales equal $1,992,562.64 after eight years of 9 percent 
growth. This figure really means that the business will generate roughly 
$2,000,000 of sales in the ninth year.)

QuickBooks data file in a multi-user setting.

Appendix A
Installing QuickBooks in 
Ten Easy Steps
I
f you haven’t already installed QuickBooks, get it over with right now:
 
 
1. Turn on the PC.
 
 Find and flip on the computer’s power switch. (Depending on which ver-
sion of Windows 2000, XP, or Vista you’re using, your screen may look 
a little different from the figures here. I’m using Windows Vista, by the 
way. Not that you care, or that it matters.)
 
 If you’re installing QuickBooks on a computer running a professional 
or business edition of Windows, you may need to log on as either the 
administrator or a user with administrator rights. With the business 
flavors of the Windows operating systems, Windows security features 
require an administrator to install the QuickBooks program.
 
2. Get the QuickBooks CD.
 
 Rip open the QuickBooks package and get out the CD (which looks 
exactly like the ones that play music).
 
3. Insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive.
 
 Windows recognizes that you inserted the QuickBooks CD and displays 
a little message box that tells you “Don’t worry. I’m about to install 
QuickBooks 2009.” The message then asks you to click Next.
 
 Let me tell you something weird about the QuickBooks installation 
before you go any further. The installation process requires two sepa-
rate installation programs. The first installation program checks for 
updates (bug fixes and so forth) to the QuickBooks software. The 
second installation program actually installs the QuickBooks software.
 
4. Tell QuickBooks to go ahead and check for bug fixes (because that’s 
just the sort of person you are).
 
 To start the first “update checking bug killing” installation program, 
click the Next button when the installation program asks whether you 
want to do this (see Figure A-1). The first installation then checks for 
updates and makes the appropriate changes.

342

Figure A-1:

the early 
milestones 
on the

installation 
journey.
 
 
5. Run the second “real” installation program.
 
 Ultimately, the QuickBooks installation window appears (see Figure A-2). 
Click its Next button. The installation program begins, asking several 
awkward technical questions — how much you weigh, whether you watch 
your cholesterol, whether you always wear your seatbelt — but don’t tie 
yourself in knots. Just accept the default, or suggested, answers. (The 
default installation options are fine for 999 of 1,000 users.)
 
Figure A-2: 
The 
QuickBooks 
Installation 
window.
 
 
6. Provide the license and product number.
 
 Finally, the QuickBooks License Number and Product Number window 
appears. Enter these two bits of licensing information (they should be 
printed on a yellow sticker on the back of the CD sleeve) and then click 
Next.

 Appendix A: Installing QuickBooks in Ten Easy Steps
 
7. Decide whether you want Google Desktop installed.
 
 The installation program asks whether you want Google Desktop 
installed. Go ahead, click Yes and then click Install. (QuickBooks likes to 
play with Google.) At long last, the true file-copying installation process 
begins. The program slowly begins extracting files from the CD. Did I 
mention that this process is slow? Think glacier sliding down the side of a 
mountain. Obviously, you need to follow the on-screen instructions, but 
don’t get stressed. If you have a question about an installation option, 
just accept the QuickBooks suggestion by pressing Enter.
 
 While the installation program runs, you should see a little bar that 
shows your progress.
 
 If you need to cancel the installation at any time, just click Cancel. 
QuickBooks warns you that the setup is incomplete. That’s okay; just 
start the setup from scratch next time around.
 
8. Take 30 seconds or so to contemplate the meaning of life or get a 
drink of water.
 
9. When the Install program finishes, click Finish.
 
 Congratulations. You’re finished with the installation. You have a new 
item on the Programs menu and probably new shortcuts on your desktop.
 
10. (Optional) Celebrate.
 
 Stand up at your desk, click your heels together three times, and repeat 
the phrase “There’s no place like home.” And watch out for flying 
houses.
As soon as you’re done celebrating, you may want to flip to Chapter 2 and 
find out how to register the program. You’ll probably want to register 
QuickBooks before you begin using it.
 
If you work on a network and want to share a QuickBooks file stored on 
one computer with another computer on the network, you need to install 
QuickBooks on all the other computers that you want to use to work with the 
file. Note: You need a separate copy of QuickBooks — such as from the five-
pack version — for each computer on which you want to install QuickBooks.
By the way — and I mention this just because I had a couple of clients ask 
about it — running QuickBooks on a network with multiple QuickBooks users 
isn’t supertricky or terribly complicated. QuickBooks takes care of the hard 
stuff. If you have more than one person using QuickBooks, you owe it to your-
self (and your business) to set up a network and then purchase and install 
multiple copies of QuickBooks. Read Appendix C for more information.

Part VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
If Numbers Are Your Friends
Y
ou don’t need to know much about accounting or about double-entry 
bookkeeping to use QuickBooks, which, as you know, is most of its 
appeal. If you’re serious about this accounting business or serious about 
your business, consider finding out a bit more; setting up QuickBooks and 
understanding all the QuickBooks reports will be easier, and you’ll be more 
sophisticated in your accounting, too.
 
Just because the accounting in this appendix is a little more complicated 
doesn’t mean that you can’t understand it. To make this whole discussion 
more concrete, I use one running example. I hope it helps you out! If nothing 
else, it’ll inspire you to get into the rowboat rental business.
Keying In on Profit
Start with the big picture. The key purpose of an accounting system is to 
enable you to answer the burning question “Am I making any money?”
Accounting is that simple. Really. At least conceptually. So, throughout the 
rest of this appendix, I just talk about how to calculate a business’s profits in 
a reasonably accurate but still practical manner.
Let me introduce you to the new you
You just moved to Montana for the laid-back living and fresh air. You live in 
a cute log cabin on Flathead Lake. To support yourself, you plan to purchase 
several rowboats and rent them to visiting fly fishermen. Of course, you’ll 
probably need to do quite a bit of fly fishing, too, but just consider it the 
price you pay for being your own boss.

346
Part VI: Appendixes 
The first day in business
It’s your first day in business. About 5 a.m., ol’ Peter Gruntpaw shows up to 
deliver your three rowboats. He made them for you in his barn, but even so, 
they aren’t cheap. He charges $1,500 apiece, so you write him a check for 
$4,500.
Peter’s timing, as usual, is impeccable. About 5:15 a.m., your first custom-
ers arrive. Mr. and Mrs. Hamster (pronounced “ohm-stair”) are visiting from 
Phoenix. They want to catch the big fish. You’re a bit unsure of your pricing, 
but you suggest $25 per hour for the boat. They agree and pay $200 in cash 
for eight hours.
A few minutes later, another couple arrives. The Gerbils (pronounced “go-
bells”) are very agitated. They were supposed to meet the Hamsters and 
fish together, but the Hamsters are rowing farther and farther away from the 
dock. To speed the Gerbils’ departure, you let them leave without paying, but 
you’re not worried. As the Gerbils leave the dock, Ms. Gerbil shouts, “We’ll 
pay you the $200 when we get back!”
Although you don’t rent the third boat, you do enjoy a sleepy summer morning.
About 2 p.m., the Hamsters and Gerbils come rowing back into view. 
Obviously, though, a problem has occurred. You find out what it is when the 
first boat arrives. “Gerbil fell into the lake,” laughs Mr. Hamster. “Lost his 
wallet, too.” Everybody else seems to think that the lost wallet is funny. You 
secretly wonder how you’re going to get paid. No wallet, no money.
You ask Mr. Gerbil whether he will come out to the lake tomorrow to pay 
you. He says he’ll just write you a check when he gets home to Phoenix. 
Reluctantly, you agree.
Look at your cash flow first
I just described a fairly simple situation. But even so, answering the question 
“Did I make any money?” won’t be easy. You start by looking at your cash 
flow: You wrote a check for $4,500, and you collected $200 in cash. Table B-1 
shows your cash flow.

Subtract the cash.
Money to purchase rowboats
($4,500)
Equals your cash 
flow:
($4,300)
To summarize, you had $200 come in but $4,500 go out. So your cash flow 
was –$4,300. (That’s why the $4,300 is in parentheses.) From a cash-flow 
perspective, the first day doesn’t look all that good, right? But does the cash-
flow calculation show you whether you’re making money? Can you look at it 
and gauge whether your little business is on the right track?
 
The answer to both questions is no. Your cash flow is important. You can’t, 
for example, write a $4,500 check unless you have at least $4,500 in your 
checking account. Your cash flow doesn’t tell you whether you’re making 
money, though. In fact, you may see a couple of problems with looking just at 
the cash flow of the rowboat rental business.
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick
Here’s the first problem: If you take good care of the rowboats, you can use 
them every summer for the next few years. In fact, say that the rowboat 
rental season, which runs from early spring to late autumn, is 150 days long 
and that your well-made rowboats will last ten years.
 
 You can probably rent the rowboats for 1,500 days.
 
 (One-hundred-fifty days per year times ten years equals 1,500 days.)
 
 Each rowboat costs $1,500.
 
 The depreciation expense for each rowboat is only $1 per day over 1,500 
days. That’s a whopping $3 for all three boats.
Do you see what I’m saying? If you have something that costs a great deal 
of money but lasts for a long time, spreading out the cost makes sense. This 
spreading out is usually called depreciation. The little $1 chunks that are allo-
cated to a day are the depreciation expense.

348
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
Accountants use the terms cost and expense to mean distinctly differ-
ent things. A cost is the price that you pay for something. If you pay Peter 
Gruntpaw $1,500 for a rowboat, the rowboat’s cost is $1,500. An expense, on 
the other hand, is what you use in a profit calculation. The little $1 chunks of 
the rowboat’s $1,500 cost (that are allocated to individual days) are expenses.
If this depreciation stuff seems wacky, remember that what you’re really trying 
to do is figure out whether you made any money your first day of business. And 
all I’m really saying is that you shouldn’t include the whole cost of the rowboats 
as an expense in the first day’s profit calculation. Some of the cost should be 
included as an expense in calculating the profit in future days. That’s fair, right?
Accrual-basis accounting is cool
You don’t want to forget about the $200 that the Gerbils owe you, either. 
Although Mr. Gerbil (remember that the name is pronounced “go-bell”) may 
not send you the check for several days or even for several weeks, he will pay 
you. You earned the money.
 
The principles of accounting say that you should include sales in your profit 
calculations when you earn the money and not when you actually collect it. 
The logic behind this include-sales-when-they’re-earned rule is that it pro-
duces a better estimate of the business you’re doing.
Say that the day after the Gerbils and Hamsters rent the rowboats, you have 
no customers, but Mr. Gerbil comes out and pays you $200. If you use the 
include-sales-when-they’re-earned rule — called accrual-basis accounting — 
your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$400
$0
If you instead use cash-basis accounting (in which you count sales when you 
collect the cash), your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$200
$200
The traditional accrual-based accounting method shows that you have a good 
day when you rent two boats and a terrible day when you don’t rent any boats. 
In comparison, when you use cash-basis accounting, your sales record looks 
as though you rented a boat each day, even though you didn’t. Now you know 
why accrual-basis accounting is a better way to measure profit.

349
 Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends
 
Accrual-basis accounting also works for expenses. You should count an 
expense when you make it, not when you pay it. For example, you call the 
local radio station and ask the people there to announce your new boat-rental 
business a couple of times for a fee of $25. Although you don’t have to pay the 
radio station the day you make the arrangements for your announcement, you 
should still count the $25 as an expense for that day.
Now you know how to measure profits
With what you now know, you’re ready to measure the first day’s profits. 
Table B-2 is a profit and loss statement for your first day in business.

$372

Although the first day’s cash flow was terrible, your little business is quite 
profitable. In fact, if you really do make about $370 per day, you’ll recoup 
your entire $4,500 investment in less than three weeks. That’s pretty darn 
good.
Different names, same logic
I don’t see any point in hiding this nasty little 
accounting secret from you: Accountants 
call this cost-allocation process by different 
names, depending on what sort of cost is being 
spread out.
Usually, the cost allocation is called depre-
ciation. You depreciate buildings, machinery, 
furniture, and many other items as well. 
Allocating the cost of a natural resource — 
such as crude oil that you pump, coal that you 
dig, or minerals that you extract — is depletion. 
And allocating the cost of things that aren’t tan-
gible — copyrights and patents, for example — 
is amortization.

350
Part VI: Appendixes 
Some financial brain food
Now that you know how to measure profits, I can fill you in on some impor-
tant conceptual stuff:
 
 You measure profits for a specific period of time.
 
 In the rowboat business example, you measured the profits for a day. 
Some people actually do measure profits (or they try to measure profits) 
on a daily basis. Most times, though, people use bigger chunks of time. 
Monthly chunks of time are common, for example, as are three-month 
chunks of time (quarters). And everybody measures profits annually — if 
only because the government makes you do so for income tax accounting.
 
 When people start talking about how often and for what chunks of 
time profits are measured, they use a couple of terms.
 
 The year that you calculate profits for is the fiscal year. The smaller 
chunks of time for which you measure profits over the year are account-
ing periods or interim accounting periods.
 
 You don’t need to memorize these new terms. But now that you’ve read 
them, you’ll probably remember them.
 
 The length of your accounting periods involves an awkward trade-off.
 
 Daily profit and loss calculations show you how well you did at the end 
of every day, but you have to collect the data and do the work every 
day. And preparing a profit and loss statement is a great deal of work.
 
 I made the example purposefully easy by including only a few transac-
tions. In real life, you have many more transactions to worry about and 
fiddle with.
 
 If you use a quarterly interim accounting period, you don’t have to 
collect the raw data and do the arithmetic very often, but you know 
how you’re doing only every once in a while.
 
 In my mind, checking your profits only four times per year isn’t enough. 
A lot can happen in three months.
In the Old Days, Things Were Different
If you’re new to the arithmetic and logic of profit calculation — which is 
mostly what modern accounting is all about — you won’t be surprised to 
hear that not all that long ago, most people couldn’t and didn’t do much 
profit calculating.

351
 Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends
What they did instead was monitor a business’s financial condition. They 
used — well, actually, they still use — a balance sheet to monitor the finan-
cial condition. A balance sheet just lists a business’s assets and its liabilities 
at a particular point in time.
Say that at the start of your first day in the rowboat-rental business — before 
you pay Peter Gruntpaw — you have $5,000 in your checking account. To 
make the situation interesting, $4,000 of this money is a loan from your 
mother-in-law, and $1,000 is cash that you invested in your business.
 
Here’s a key to help you understand the balance sheets and cash flow in this 
section:
 
 A business’s assets are composed of things that the business owns.
 
 Liabilities consist of the amounts that the business owes.
 
 Equity is the difference between the business’s assets and its liabilities. 
Interestingly, equity also shows the money that the owners or share-
holders or partners have left in the business.
 
 If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that go on the balance 
sheet, the total assets value always equals the total liabilities plus total 
owner’s equity value.
Your balance sheet at the beginning of the day looks like the one in Table B-3.

If you construct a balance sheet at the end of the first day, the financial pic-
ture is only slightly more complicated. Some of these explanations are too 
complicated to give in a sentence, so the paragraphs that follow describe 
how I got each number.

352
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
Even if you don’t pay much attention, I recommend that you quickly read 
through the explanations. Mostly, I want you to understand that if you try 
to monitor a business’s financial condition by using a balance sheet, as I’ve 
done here, the picture gets messy. Later in this appendix, I talk about how 
QuickBooks makes all this stuff easier.

Cash, the first line item shown in Table B-4, is the most complicated line item 
to prove. If you were really in the rowboat-rental business, of course, you 
could just look at your checkbook. But if you were writing an appendix about 
being in the rowboat-rental business (as I am), you’d need to be able to calcu-
late the cash balance. Table B-5 shows the calculation of the cash balance for 
your rowboat-rental business.

 Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends
The $200 receivable, the second line item shown in Table B-4, is the money 
that the Gerbils owe you.
The third line shown in Table B-4, the Rowboats balance sheet value, is 
$4,497. This is weird, I’ll grant you, but here’s how you figure it: You deduct 
from the original cost of the asset all the depreciation expense that you 
charged to date. The original cost of the three rowboats was $4,500. You 
charged only $3 of depreciation for the first day, so the balance sheet value, 
or net book value, is $4,497.
The only liabilities are the $25 that you owe the radio station for those new 
business announcements (shown on the seventh line in Table B-4) and the 
$4,000 that you borrowed from your mother-in-law (shown on the eighth line 
in Table B-4). I won’t even ask why you opened that can of worms.
Finally, the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet shows the $1,000 that 
you originally contributed (see line 10 in Table B-4) and also the $372 you 
earned (see line 11 in Table B-4).
 
It’s not a coincidence that the total assets value equals the total liabilities plus 
the total owner’s equity value. If you correctly calculate each of the numbers 
that go on the balance sheet, the two totals are always equal.
 
A balance sheet lists asset, liability, and owner’s equity balances as of a spe-
cific date. It gives you a financial snapshot at a point in time. Usually, you pre-
pare a balance sheet whenever you prepare a profit and loss statement. The 
balance sheet shows account balances for the last day of the fiscal year and 
interim accounting period. (I think that it’s kind of neat that after only a few 
pages of this appendix, you’re reading and understanding such terms as fiscal 
year and interim accounting period.)
What Does an Italian Monk 
Have to Do with Anything?
So far, I’ve provided narrative descriptions of all the financial events that 
affect the balance sheet and the income statement. I describe how you 
started the business with $5,000 of cash (a $4,000 loan from your mother-in-
law and $1,000 of cash that you yourself invested). At an even earlier point 
in this appendix, I noted how you rented a boat to the Hamsters for $200 and 
they paid you in cash.

354
Part VI: Appendixes 
Although the narrative descriptions of financial events — such as starting the 
business or renting to the Hamsters — make for just-bearable reading, they 
are unwieldy for accountants to use in practice. Partly, this awkwardness is 
because accountants are usually (or maybe always?) terrible writers. But an 
even bigger problem is that using the lots-and-lots-of-words approach makes 
describing all the little bits and pieces of information that you need difficult 
and downright tedious.
Fortunately, about 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Lucia Pacioli 
thought the same thing. No, I’m not making this up. What Pacioli really said 
was, “Hey, guys. Hello? Is anybody in there? You have to get more efficient 
in the way that you describe your financial transactions. You have to create 
a financial shorthand system that works when you have a large number of 
transactions to record.”
Pacioli proceeded to describe a financial shorthand system that made it 
easy to collect all the little bits and pieces of information needed to prepare 
income statements and balance sheets. The shorthand system he described? 
Double-entry bookkeeping.
This system enabled people to name the income statement or balance sheet 
line items or accounts that are affected and then give the dollar amount of 
the effect. The profit and loss statement and the balance sheet line items are 
accounts. You need to remember this term.
 
A list of profit and loss statement and balance sheet line items is a chart of 
accounts. You might already know this term from using QuickBooks.
Pacioli also did one wacky thing: He used a couple of new terms — debit and 
credit — to describe the increases and decreases in accounts:
 
 Debit: Increases in asset accounts and in expense accounts are debits. 
Decreases in liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also 
debits.
 
 Credit: Decreases in asset and expense accounts are credits. Increases in 
liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also credits.
Keeping these terms straight is a bit confusing, so see Table B-6 for help.
 
I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but if you want to use double-entry book-
keeping, you need to memorize the information in Table B-6. If it’s any conso-
lation, this information is the only chunk of data in the entire book that I ask 
you to memorize. Or, failing that, dog-ear this page so that you can flip here 
quickly — or just refer to the Cheat Sheet.

And now for the blow-by-blow
The best way to help you understand this double-entry bookkeeping stuff 
is to show you how to use it to record all the financial events that I’ve dis-
cussed thus far in this appendix. Start with the money that you invested in 
the business and the money that you foolishly borrowed from your mother-
in-law. You invested $1,000 in cash, and you borrowed $4,000 in cash. Here 
are the double-entry bookkeeping transactions — the journal entries — that 
describe these financial events.

If you add up all the debits and credits in a journal entry, you get a trial bal-
ance. A trial balance isn’t all that special, but you use it to prepare profit and 
loss statements and balance sheets easily. If you add up the debits and credits 
shown in journal entries 1 and 2, you get the trial balance shown in Table B-7.

$1,000
This trial balance provides the raw data needed to construct the rowboat-
business balance sheet at the start of the first day. If you don’t believe me, 
take a peek at Table B-3. Oh, sure, the information shown in Table B-7 isn’t 
as polished. Table B-7 doesn’t provide labels, for example, that tell you that 
cash is an asset. And Table B-7 doesn’t provide subtotals showing the total 
assets (equal to $5,000) and the total liabilities and owner’s equity (also 
equal to $5,000). But it does provide the raw data.
Take a look at the journal entries you would make to record the rest of the 
first day’s financial events:
Journal Entry 3: To record the purchase of the three $1,500 rowboats

To build a trial balance for the end of the first day, you add all the first-day 
journal entries to the trial balance shown in Table B-7. The result is the trial 
balance shown in Table B-8.

The trial balance shown in Table B-8 provides the raw data used to prepare

Part VI: Appendixes 
If you look at the accounts labeled Balance sheet accounts in Table B-8 and 
compare these with the balance sheet shown in Table B-4, you see that this 
trial balance provides all the raw numbers needed for the balance sheet. The 
only numbers in Table B-4 that aren’t directly from Table B-8 are the subto-
tals that you get by adding up other numbers.
If you look at the accounts labeled as Profit and loss statement accounts in Table 
B-8 and compare them with the profit and loss statement shown in Table B-2, 
you see that this trial balance also provides all the raw numbers needed for 
the profit and loss statement. Again, the only numbers in Table B-2 that aren’t 
directly from Table B-8 are the subtotals that you get by adding up other 
numbers.
Blow-by-blow, Part II
If you understand what I’ve discussed so far in this appendix, you grasp how 
accounting and double-entry bookkeeping work. I want to show you about a 
half-dozen more transaction examples, however, to plug a few minor holes in 
your knowledge.
When you collect money that you’ve previously billed, you record the trans-
action by debiting cash and crediting receivables (or accounts receivable). In 
the rowboat business, you make this basic entry when Mr. Gerbil later pays 
you the $200 that he owes you for the first day’s rental.
Journal Entry 8: To record a payment by a customer
Debit
Credit
Cash

Receivable

Don’t record a sale when you collect the cash. The sale has already been 
recorded in Journal Entry 5. When you pay the radio station for the advertis-
ing, you record the transaction by debiting accounts payable and crediting 
cash.
Journal Entry 9: To record your payment of $25 to the radio station
Debit
Credit
Payable
$25
Cash
$25

359
 Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends
The one other thing I want to cover — ever so briefly — is inventory account-
ing. Accounting for items that you buy and resell or the items that you make 
and resell is a bit trickier, and I don’t have room to go into a great deal of 
detail.
When you buy items to resell, you debit an asset account, often named 
Inventory. If you purchase 300 of the $10 thingamajigs that you hope to resell 
for $25 each, you record the following journal entry:
Journal Entry 10: To record the cash purchase of thingamajigs
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$3,000
Cash
$3,000
When you sell a thingamajig, you need to do two tasks: record the sale and 
record the cost of the sale. If you need to record the sale of 100 thingamajigs 
for $25 each, for example, you record the following journal entry:
Journal Entry 11: To record the sale of 100 thingamajigs for $25 apiece
Debit
Credit
Receivable
$2,500
Sales
$2,500
You also need to record the cost of the thingamajigs that you sold as an 
expense and record the reduction in the value of your thingamajig inventory. 
That means that if you reduce your inventory count from 300 items to 200 
items, you need to adjust your inventory’s dollar value. You record the fol-
lowing journal entry:
Journal Entry 12: To record the cost of the 100 thingamajigs sold
Debit
Credit
Cost of goods sold
$1,000
Inventory
$1,000
The cost of goods sold account, by the way, is just another expense. It 
appears on your profit and loss statement.

Part VI: Appendixes 
How does QuickBooks help?
If you keep (or someone else keeps) the books for your business manually, 
you actually have to make these journal entries. When you use QuickBooks 
to keep the books, however, all this debiting and crediting business usually 
goes on behind the scenes. When you invoice a customer, QuickBooks debits 
accounts receivable and credits sales. When you write a check to pay some 
bill, QuickBooks debits the expense (or the accounts payable account) and 
credits cash.
In the few cases in which a financial transaction isn’t recorded automati-
cally when you fill in an on-screen form, you need to use the General Journal 
Entry window. To display the General Journal Entry window, choose 
Company➪Make General Journal Entries. You use the General Journal Entry 
window to create journal entries. An example of one of these noncash trans-
actions is depreciation expense.
QuickBooks automatically builds a trial balance, using journal entries that 
it constructs automatically and any journal entries that you enter by using 
the General Journal Entry window. If you want to see the trial balance, just 
choose Reports➪Accountant & Taxes➪Trial Balance. QuickBooks prepares 
balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and several other reports by 
using the trial balance.
Two Dark Shadows in the 
World of Accounting
The real purpose of accounting systems, such as QuickBooks, is simple: 
Accounting systems are supposed to make succeeding in your business 
easier for you. You may think, therefore, that the world of accounting is a 
friendly place. Unfortunately, this scenario isn’t quite true. I’m sorry to report 
that two dark shadows hang over the world of accounting: financial account-
ing standards and income tax laws.
The first dark shadow
“Financial accounting standards,” you say. “What the heck are those?”
Here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: Financial accounting standards are 
accounting rules created by certified public accountants. These rules are sup-
posed to make reading financial statements and understanding what’s going on 
easier for people. (I happen to believe that just the opposite is often true in the 

361
 Appendix B: If Numbers Are Your Friends
case of small businesses, in case you’re interested.) But because of what finan-
cial accounting standards purport to do, some people — such as bank loan offi-
cers — want to see profit and loss statements and balance sheets that follow 
the rules. The exact catchphrase is one that you might have heard before: 
“Prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
Unfortunately, the rules are very complicated; the rules are inconsistently 
interpreted; and actually applying the rules would soon run most small busi-
nesses into the ground. (And, as you were running your business into the 
ground — you’ll be happy to know — your certified public accountant would 
make a great deal of money helping you figure out what you were supposed 
to be doing.) So what should you do about this first dark shadow?
 
Glad you asked:
 
 Know that it exists. Know that people like your banker honestly think 
that you should follow a supercomplicated set of accounting rules.
 
 Don’t get sucked into the financial accounting standards tar pit. Tell 
people — your banker included — that you do your accounting in the 
way that you think enables you to best manage your business. Tell 
people that a small business like yours can’t afford to have an in-house 
staff of full-time CPAs. Finally, tell people that you don’t necessarily pre-
pare your financial statements “in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.”
 
Do attempt to fully and fairly disclose your financial affairs to people who 
need to know about them. Lying to a creditor or an investor about your finan-
cial affairs or getting sneaky with one of these people is a good way to end up 
in jail.
The second dark shadow
And now, here’s the second dark shadow: income tax accounting laws. You 
know that Congress enacts tax legislation to raise revenue. And you know 
that it does so in a political environment strewn with all sorts of partisan 
voodoo economics and social overtones. So you won’t be surprised to find 
out that the accounting rules that come out of the nation’s capital and your 
state capital don’t make much sense for running a business.
 
You need to apply the rules when you prepare your tax return, of course, but 
you don’t have to use them the rest of the year. A far better approach is to 
do your accounting in a way that enables you to best run your business. That 
way, you don’t use accounting tricks and gambits that make sense for income 
tax accounting but foul up your accounting system. At the end of the year, 
when you’re preparing your tax return, have your tax preparer adjust your 
trial balance so that it conforms to income tax accounting laws.

362
Part VI: Appendixes 
The Danger of Shell Games
This appendix is longer than I initially intended. I’m sorry about that. I want 
to share one more thought with you, however. And I think that it’s an impor-
tant thought, so please stay with me.
You could use the accounting knowledge that this appendix imparts to do the 
bookkeeping for a very large business. As crazy as it sounds, if you had 3,000 
rowboats for rent — perhaps you have rental outlets at dozens of lakes scat-
tered all over the Rockies — you might actually be able to keep the books for 
a $200 million-per-year business. You would have to enter many more trans-
actions, and the numbers would all be bigger, but you wouldn’t necessarily 
be doing anything more complicated than the transactions in this appendix.
Unfortunately, the temptation is great — especially on the part of financial 
advisors — to let the money stuff get more complicated as a business grows. 
People start talking about sophisticated leasing arrangements that make 
sense because of the tax laws. A customer or vendor suggests some compli-
cated profit-sharing or cost-reimbursement agreement. Then your attorney 
talks you into setting up a couple of new subsidiaries for legal reasons.
All these schemes make accounting for your business terribly complicated. 
If you choose to ignore this complexity and go on your merry way, very soon 
you won’t know whether you’re making money. (I’ve seen plenty of people 
go this route — and it isn’t pretty.) On the other hand, if you truly want to do 
accurate accounting in a complex environment, you need to spend a great 
deal of cash for really smart accountants. (This tactic, of course, assumes 
that you can find, hire, and afford these really smart accountants.)
 
If you’re unsure how to tell whether something is just too complicated, here’s 
a general rule you can use: If you can’t easily create the journal entries that 
quantify the financial essence of some event, you’re in trouble.
So what should you do? I suggest that you don’t complicate your business’s 
finances — not even if you think that the newfangled, tax-incentivized, sale-
leaseback profit plan is a sure winner. Keep things simple, my friend. To win 
the game, you have to keep score.

Appendix C
Sharing QuickBooks Files
O
kay, here’s a cool deal: Within QuickBooks, you can set up user permis-
sions, which lets you specify who has access to which areas of your 
QuickBooks files. In fact, you can also work with your QuickBooks file on a 
network and in a multiple-user environment by using the powerful feature 
record locking.
 
If you work on a network and need to use or just want to find out about the 
QuickBooks network features, read this appendix. If your computer isn’t con-
nected to a network but you want to designate unique permissions for differ-
ent people by using a QuickBooks file on a single computer, read the section 
“Setting Up User Permissions,” later in this appendix. And, if you’re the only 
one using QuickBooks, you can skip this appendix.
Sharing a QuickBooks File on a Network
Two important features power the QuickBooks multi-user network capability: 
user permissions and record locking. The user permissions feature lets multi-
ple users of a QuickBooks file have unique permissions settings to access dif-
ferent areas of QuickBooks. Record locking, the second feature, allows more 
than one person at a time to log on to and work with a QuickBooks file.
User permissions
QuickBooks lets you set user permissions so that you can give different 
QuickBooks users different privileges. For example, Jane Owner may be able 
to do anything she wants because, metaphorically speaking, she’s Da Man. 
Joe Clerk, though, may be able to only enter bills. Joe, a lowly clerk of per-
haps dubious judgment and discretion, may not have the ability to view the 
company’s profit and loss statement, print checks, or record customer pay-
ments. This idea makes sense at a practical level, right? In a situation where 
a bunch of people access the QuickBooks file, you want to make sure that 
confidential information remains confidential.

364
Part VI: Appendixes 
You also want to make sure that people can’t intentionally or unintention-
ally corrupt your financial records. For example, you don’t want someone 
to enter incorrect data (perhaps because they stumble into some area of 
the QuickBooks program where they have no business). And you don’t want 
someone fraudulently recording transactions — such as fake checks that 
they can go cash.
I think that if you reflect on this user permissions stuff, you’ll realize, “Hey, 
yeah, that makes sense!” So I’m not going to talk a bunch more about it. Let 
me conclude by throwing out a couple of general observations about how 
you decide which user permissions are appropriate:
 
 Data confidentiality: This issue probably has the most to do with your 
management philosophy. The more open you are about stuff, the less 
you probably have to worry about people snooping for stuff. I want to 
point out, however, that payroll is always a touchy subject. If everybody 
knows what everyone else is paid, some interesting discussions occur — 
but you already knew that.
 
 Data corruption: Regarding data corruption, you need to know that 
people usually apply two general rules:
 
• Don’t give people access to tools they don’t know how to use. 
That’s only asking for trouble.
 
• Make sure that no lone person can muck around unsupervised in 
some area of the accounting system — especially if that person 
records or handles cash.
 
If at all possible, employ a buddy system whereby people do stuff together so 
that people always double-check — even if only indirectly — other people’s 
work. Maybe Joe records a bill, for example, but Jane always cuts the check 
to pay the bill. Maybe Raul records customer invoices but Chang sends them 
out. Maybe Saul records cash receipts but Beth deposits them. You see the 
pattern, right? If two people deal with a particular economic event — again, 
especially one that involves cash — it’s a really good idea for Joe and Jane, 
Raul and Chang, and Saul and Beth to look over each other’s shoulders.
Just what is a network, anyway?
A network is a set of computers connected 
so that the people who use the computers 
can share information. Uh, well, this is some-
what self-serving, but let me say that if you 
don’t currently use a network, Networking For 
Dummies, 8th Edition, by Doug Lowe, and Home 
Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Kathy 
Ivens (both published by Wiley), explain how to 
set up a small business network in a couple of 
hours and live to tell about it.

365
 Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files
Record locking
The easiest way to understand record locking is to compare it with the other 
variety of locking: file locking. Most of the other programs that you use — per-
haps every one but QuickBooks — use file locking. What file locking means is 
this: If one person on the network has, for instance, a word processing docu-
ment open, nobody else on the network can open that document. Others may 
be able to open a copy of the document that they can save on their comput-
ers, but they can’t edit the original document. The operating system locks the 
original document (the file) so that only one person at a time can fool around 
with the file. This locking ensures the integrity of the data and the changes that 
people make to the data. (If this business about ensuring integrity seems weird, 
think about the difficulty of making sure that both people’s changes end up in a 
word processing document that both people are simultaneously editing.)
Record locking works differently. With record locking, more than one person 
on the network can open and edit the same file at once, but only one person 
can work with a specific record.
 
A record is a part of a file. For example, in a file of bills that you owe to ven-
dors, the file is the entire collection of bills. The individual bills are records 
within the file, and more than one person can open the file of bills. Individual 
bills, though — the individual records that make up the file — are locked 
when a person grabs a record.
This information sounds like too much confusion, but differentiating between 
files and the records within a file is what makes sharing files possible. In 
QuickBooks, for example, if Jane is entering one bill for the Alpha Company in 
a file, Joe can edit a bill for Beta Corporation because the two bills are differ-
ent records. However, Jane can’t — because of record locking — fool around 
with the Beta Corporation bill that Joe is editing. And Joe can’t — again, 
because of record locking — fiddle with the Alpha Company bill that Jane’s 
entering.
Restated more generally, no two people can edit the same record in the file at 
the same time. Record locking enables employees to use a file in a multi-user 
environment because it lets more than one person work with a file.
Installing QuickBooks for Network Use
To install QuickBooks for network use, you must first install QuickBooks 
on all the computers on the network that need to access and work with the 
QuickBooks file. This task isn’t tricky. You don’t need to install QuickBooks in 
any fancy way to be able to share QuickBooks files.

366
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
You need to purchase a copy of QuickBooks for each computer that will 
run the program. If you have five computers on which you want to use 
QuickBooks, you need to buy five copies of QuickBooks. Or you can buy 
the special five-license version of QuickBooks. If you attempt to install a 
single copy of QuickBooks (with a single key code) on multiple computers, 
QuickBooks won’t allow two computers using the same key code to share a 
file in multi-user mode.
When you create the file that you want to share, you need to make sure that 
you store the file in a location where the other QuickBooks users can access 
it. You may need to store the file on a server. You can also store the file on a 
client computer as long as you designate sharing permissions for either the 
folder or the drive on which you save the QuickBooks file.
 
Another important thing: Whoever creates the QuickBooks file automatically 
becomes the file administrator. The file administrator has access to all areas of 
the file and sets up the other file users, so you don’t want just anybody setting 
up the QuickBooks file. Either the business owner or the head of accounting is 
well suited for this job. In any case, the person who sets up the file should be 
trustworthy, regularly around the office, and easy to reach for any questions 
or problems that arise. And this person probably should have a strong back-
ground in accounting. See the following section for more details.
Choosing a good password
The administrator has access to all areas of 
QuickBooks, so picking a good password is 
especially important. Other users (especially 
those with higher levels of access permission) 
also need to select their passwords carefully.
A good password is one that you can easily 
remember but that other people can’t easily 
guess. Combinations of letters and numbers are 
the best way to go. For example, use your grade 
school nickname plus the number of your favor-
ite basketball player. Or use a random number 
combined with the name of your favorite 
restaurant (as long as you don’t walk around 
all day muttering “Number nine, number nine, 
number nine” and raving about your love of 
this particular eatery). Avoid using telephone 
numbers, family names, and family dates 
(such as the birthday of a family member). And 
absolutely do not use banking PINs or Social 
Security numbers.
One last tip: QuickBooks lets you create pass-
words from 0–16 characters long. As a general 
rule, choose a password that’s five or more 
characters long.

367
 Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files
Setting Up User Permissions
You can tell QuickBooks who else will use the file and set permissions for 
these other people during the EasyStep Interview (see Chapter 2). I assume 
that you give QuickBooks this information later. To do it later, use the User 
List dialog box, as shown in Figure C-1. To display this dialog box, choose 
Company➪Set Up Users.
 
Figure C-1: 
The User 
List 
dialog box.
 
 
1. Click the Add User button.
 
 Doing so displays the first page of the Set Up User Password and Access 
Wizard (see Figure C-2). You use this wizard to add new users and spec-
ify user permissions.
 
Figure C-2: 
The first

Password 
and Access 
Wizard 
page.
 
 
2. Type a username and password for the additional person whom you 
want to be able to use the QuickBooks file; type the password again in 
the Confirm Password text box.
 
 Reentering the password confirms that you typed the password cor-
rectly the first time.

368
Part VI: Appendixes 
 
 From this point, when someone opens the QuickBooks file, QuickBooks 
asks for a username and password. So, for another person to access the 
QuickBooks file, he or she must enter the username and password that 
you set.
 
3. Click Next.
 
 QuickBooks displays a dialog box (not shown here) asking whether you 
want the person to have access to all areas of the QuickBooks file or 
only some areas.
 
4. Click All Areas or click Selected Areas; then click Next.
 
 If you specify that you want to give access to only some areas, 
QuickBooks displays a series of dialog boxes that allow you to set 
permissions for each area. Figure C-3, for example, shows the Set Up 
User Password and Access Wizard page that specifies what the new 
employee, Steve, can do with sales and accounts receivable accounting.
 
Figure C-3:

5. Designate the access permission level for each area in the Set Up User 
Password and Access Wizard.
 
 Select the No Access radio button to make the area off-limits for the 
user. Select the Full Access radio button to give the user permission 
to create and print transactions and reports in the area, or mark the 
Selective Access radio button to give partial access to the area. If you 
mark Selective Access, specify the limited access. Click Next after sup-
plying each area’s access information to proceed to the next area. The 
other areas’ wizard pages look and work the same way.

369
 Appendix C: Sharing QuickBooks Files
 
6. Tell QuickBooks whether you want the user to be able to change or 
delete existing transactions and those recorded before the closing 
date that you specify.
 
 After you work through the access permissions for all the areas, 
QuickBooks displays a wizard page that provides option buttons for 
restricting user access to existing transactions. By specifying a closing 
date, you can prevent users — for example, new QuickBooks users or 
new employees — from altering data before a given date.
 
 To set a closing date, log on to the QuickBooks file as the administrator. 
Make sure that you’re working in single-user mode. (If you aren’t, choose 
File➪Switch to Single-User Mode.) Choose Company➪Set Up Users and 
then click the Closing Date button. On the Set Closing Date page of the 
wizard, use the Date through Which Books Are Closed text box to enter 
the date on and before when you want to restrict changes. Then click OK.
 
7. Click Next.
 
 Specify whether you want the user to be able to access QuickBooks data 
from another application, such as TurboTax.
 
8. Review the permissions that you granted the new user.
 
 After you finish stepping through the Set Up User Password and Access 
Wizard, QuickBooks shows a summary of the permissions for a user. 
Click the Prev button if you need to go back and change permissions for 
an area.
 
9. Click Finish to finish setting up the new user.
 
 QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box again but with the new 
user added. Click Add User to add another new user, click Edit User to 
edit the selected user, or click Close to close the dialog box.
 
A user can log on and open a QuickBooks file from any computer on the 
network as long as the computer has QuickBooks installed and has network 
access to the QuickBooks file. If a person attempts to open a restricted area or 
perform an unauthorized action, QuickBooks displays a message box indicat-
ing that the person lacks the permissions necessary to perform the action.
 
Individual users can specify and save their preferences for working with 
QuickBooks. For example, a user can decide to display and even customize 
the QuickBooks icon bar or set options for graphs, reminders, and warnings. 
Users can access their preference settings by choosing Edit➪Preferences. 
Select an area by clicking an icon (such as General) on the left. Click the My 
Preferences tab, if it isn’t already selected.

370
Part VI: Appendixes 
Specifying Multi-User Mode
For more than one person to work with the QuickBooks file at once, users 
must work with the QuickBooks file in multi-user mode. The first person who 
opens the file needs to specify multi-user mode for others to be able to open 
the file. To specify multi-user mode, choose File➪Switch to Multi-User Mode. 
You can tell that you’re working in multi-user mode because the QuickBooks 
title bar indicates so. When other people open the QuickBooks file, it auto-
matically opens in multi-user mode. For another user to work in single-user 
mode, the other users must close the QuickBooks file and the user wanting 
to work in single-user mode needs (or may need) to choose File➪Switch to 
Single-User Mode command.
Working in Multi-User Mode
Sharing a QuickBooks file over a network involves a couple of tricks. First, 
you need to make sure that no one who is in single-user mode is using the file 
that you want to open. If someone is, and you try to open the file, QuickBooks 
displays a message indicating that someone is using the company file in 
single-user mode. Tell the person to switch to multi-user mode and then click 
Try Again.
As soon as you begin creating or editing a transaction, QuickBooks locks the 
transaction. This way, no one else can edit the transaction while you work 
on it. You can tell whether you have a transaction open in edit mode by the 
title QuickBooks indicates on the title bar at the top of the form: QuickBooks 
displays Editing Transaction on the title bar. Other users can open the 
transaction while you edit it in edit mode, but they can’t make changes to it 
until you’re through.
For example, if you attempt to edit a transaction that your co-worker Harriet 
already has open in edit mode, QuickBooks displays a message that reads 
(and here, I paraphrase), “Excuse me, Bubba? Harriet is working with that 
transaction. You need to come back later.”
