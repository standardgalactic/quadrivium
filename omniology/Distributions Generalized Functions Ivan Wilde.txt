Introduction
The so-called Dirac delta function (on R) obeys δ(x) = 0 for all x ̸= 0 but
is supposed to satisfy
R ∞
−∞δ(x) dx = 1. (The δ function on Rd is similarly
described.) Consequently,
Z ∞
−∞
f(x) δ(x) dx =
Z ∞
−∞
(f(x) −f(0)) δ(x) dx + f(0)
Z ∞
−∞
δ(x) dx = f(0)
because (f(x)−f(0)) δ(x) ≡0 on R. Moreover, if H(x) denotes the Heaviside
step-function
H(x) =
(
0,
x < 0
1,
x ≥0 ,
then we see that H′ = δ, in the following sense. If f vanishes at inﬁnity,
then integration by parts gives
Z ∞

f(x) H′(x) dx =

f(x) H(x)

f(x) δ(x) dx .
Of course, there is no such function δ with these properties and we cannot
interpret
R ∞
−∞f(x) δ(x) dx as an integral in the usual sense. The δ function
is thought of as a generalized function.
However, what does make sense is the assignment f 7→f(0) = ⟨δ, f⟩, say.
Clearly ⟨δ, αf + βg⟩= α⟨δ, f⟩+ β⟨δ, g⟩for functions f, g and constants α
and β. In other words, the Dirac delta-function can be deﬁned not as a
function but as a functional on a suitable linear space of functions. The
development of this is the theory of distributions of Laurent Schwartz.

Chapter 1
One might think of δ(x) as a kind of limit of some sequence of functions
whose graphs become very tall and thin, as indicated in the ﬁgure.
Figure 1.1: Approximation to the δ-function.
The Dirac δ function can be thought of as a kind of continuous version of
the discrete Kronecker δ and is used in quantum mechanics to express the
orthogonality properties of non square-integrable wave functions.
Distributions play a crucial rˆole in the study of (partial) diﬀerential equa-
tions. As an introductory remark, consider the equations
∂2u
∂x∂y
= 0
and
∂2u
∂y∂x
= 0 .
These “ought” to be equivalent. However, the ﬁrst holds for any function u
independent of y, whereas the second may not make any sense. By (formally)
integrating by parts twice and discarding the surface terms, we get
Z
ϕ ∂2u
∂x∂y
dx dy =
Z
u ∂2ϕ
∂x∂y
dx dy .
So we might interpret ∂2u
∂x∂y
= 0 as
Z
u ∂2ϕ
∂x∂y
dx dy = 0
for all ϕ in some suitably chosen set of smooth functions. The point is that
this makes sense for non-diﬀerentiable u and, since ϕ is supposed smooth,
Z
u ∂2ϕ
∂x∂y
dx dy =
Z
u ∂2ϕ
∂y∂x
dx dy ,
that is,
∂2u
∂x∂y
=
∂2u
∂y∂x
in a certain weak sense.
These then are weak or
distributional derivatives.
Finally, we note that distributions also play a central rˆole in quantum ﬁeld
theory, where quantum ﬁelds are deﬁned as operator-valued distributions.

Chapter 2
The spaces S and S ′
Let Zn
+ denote the set of n-tuples (α1, . . . , αn) where each αi is a non-
negative integer and write Z+ for Z1
+. For α ∈In
+, let |α| = Pn
i=1 αi and let
Dα denote the partial diﬀerential operator
∂|α|
∂xα1
1 . . . ∂xαn
n
.
Finally, if x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn, let xα denote the product xα1
1 . . . xαn
n .
Deﬁnition 2.1. The complex linear space of bounded continuous complex-
valued functions on Rn is denoted Cb(Rn). It is equipped with the norm
∥f∥∞= sup
x∈Rn |f(x)| .
Theorem 2.2. For any d ∈N, Cb(Rd) is a complete normed space with respect
to the norm ∥· ∥∞.
Proof. Suppose (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in Cb(Rd), that is, ∥fn−fm∥∞→0
as m, n →∞. We must show that there is some f ∈Cb(Rd) such that
∥fn −f∥∞→0 as n →∞.
To see where such an f comes from, we
note that the inequality |g(x)| ≤∥g∥∞implies that for each x ∈Rd, the
sequence (fn(x)) is a Cauchy sequence in C and therefore converges. Let
f(x) = limn fn(x).
We claim that f ∈Cb(Rd) and that ∥fn −f∥∞→0. Let ε > 0 be given.
Since (fn) is a Cauchy sequence in Cb(Rd) there is N ∈N such that
∥fn −fm∥∞< 1
2 ε
(∗)
for all n, m ≥N. But then, for any x ∈Rd,
|fN+k(x)| ≤|fN+k(x) −fN(x)| + |fN(x)| < 1
2 ε + ∥fN∥∞
by (∗). Letting k →∞gives
|f(x)| ≤1
2 ε + ∥fN∥∞
which shows that f is bounded on Rd.

Chapter 2
Next, we note that for any x ∈Rd, |fn(x) −fm(x)| ≤∥fn −fm∥∞and so
the inequality (∗) implies that
|fn(x) −fm(x)| < 1
2 ε
provided n, m ≥N. Letting m →∞, we see that
|fn(x) −f(x)| ≤1
2 ε
(∗∗)
for any x ∈Rd, provided n ≥N. In other words, fn(x) →f(x) uniformly
on Rd. However, each fn is continuous and so the same is true of f. But
then this means that f ∈Cb(Rd). The inequality (∗∗) gives
∥fn −f∥∞≤1
2 ε < ε
whenever n ≥N and so fn →f with respect to ∥· ∥∞and the proof is
complete.
Deﬁnition 2.3. The linear space of inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable bounded functions
on Rn is denoted by C∞
b (Rn). Evidently C∞
b (Rn) ⊂Cb(Rn).
The space S (Rn) is the linear subspace of C∞
b (Rn) formed by the set of
functions f on Rn such that xα Dβf(x) is bounded on Rn for each α, β ∈Zn
+.
S (Rn) is equipped with the family of norms
|||f|||α,β = sup
x∈Rn | xα Dβf(x) |
for α, β ∈Zn
+. The elements of S (Rn) are said to be rapidly decreasing
functions.
Example 2.4. Evidently, the function f(x) = xm e−x2 belongs to S (R) for
any m ∈Z+. Indeed, S (R) contains all the Hermite functions.
For any polynomial p(x1, . . . , xn) on Rn, the function p(x1, . . . , xn)e−(x2
1+···+x2
n)
belongs to S (Rn).
Deﬁnition 2.5. We say that a sequence (fn) in S (Rd) converges to f in
S (Rd) if, for each α, β ∈Zd
+, |||fn −f|||α,β →0 as n →∞.
The sequence (fn) in S (Rd) is said to be a Cauchy sequence in S (Rd) if
|||fn −fm|||α,β →0 as n, m →∞, for each α, β ∈Zd
+.
Theorem 2.6. S (Rd) is complete, that is, every Cauchy sequence in S (Rd)
converges in S (Rd).
Proof. First consider the case d = 1.
So suppose that (fn) is a Cauchy
sequence in S (R). Fix α, β ∈Z+. Then we know that
|||fn −fm|||α,β →0 as n, m →∞.

In other words, the sequence xα Dβfn(x) is a Cauchy sequence with respect
to the norm ∥· ∥∞and so converges to some function gα,β, say.
We shall show that xα Dβg = gα,β. This follows from the equality
fn(x) = fn(0) +
Z x
0
f′
n(t) dt .
Indeed, f′
n = D1fn →g0,1 on R and so, letting n →∞, we may say that
g0,0(x) = g0,0(0) +
Z x
0
g0,1(t) dt .
Hence g0,0 is continuously diﬀerentiable and g′
0,0 = g0,1.
Repeating this
argument, we see that g0,0 is inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable and that Dβg0,0 = g0,β.
Now, Dβfn →g0,β = Dβg0,0 uniformly and so xα Dβfn(x) →xα Dβg0,0(x)
pointwise. But we also know that xα Dβfn →gα,β uniformly and so it follows
that gα,β = xα Dβg0,0. We note that gα,β is bounded and so g0,0 ∈S (R).
Hence fn →g0,0 in S (R) and we conclude that S (R) is complete.
For the general d-dimensional case, suppose that (fn) is a Cauchy sequence
in S (Rd).
Then for each α, β ∈Zd
+ the sequence xα Dβfn is a Cauchy
sequence in Cb(Rd) and so converges;
xα Dβfn →gα,β uniformly on Rd,
for some gα,β ∈Cb(Rd).
Fix x2, x3, . . . , xd. Then as in the 1-dimensional argument above, we know
that for any α1, β1 ∈Z+, (all relevant partial derivatives exist and)
xα1
1 ∂β1
x1fn(x1, x2, . . . , xd) →g(α1,0,...,0),(β1,0,...,0)(x1, x2, . . . , xd)
= xα1
1 ∂β1
x1g0,0(x1, x2, . . . , xd) .
Considering now the function x2 7→xα1
1 ∂β1
x1fn(x1, x2, . . . , xd), we similarly
see that
xα2
2 ∂β2
x2 xα1
1 ∂β1
x1fn(x1, . . . , xd) →g(α1,α2,0,...,0),(β1,β2,0,...,0)(x1, . . . , xd)
= xα2
2 ∂β2
x2 xα1
1 ∂β1
x1g0,0(x1, . . . , xd)
for any α2, β2 ∈Z+.
Repeating this for the function x3 7→xα2
2 ∂β2
x2 xα1
1 ∂β1
x1fn(x1, x2, . . . , xd), we
ﬁnd that
g(α1,α2,α3,0,...,0),(β1,β2,β3,0,...,0)(x1, . . . , xd)
= xα3
3 ∂β3
x3 xα2
2 ∂β2
x2 xα1
1 ∂β1
x1g0,0(x1, . . . , xd)
for α3, β3 ∈Z+. Continuing this way, we conclude that
gα,β = xα Dβg0,0
for any α, β ∈Zd
+. It follows that fn →g0,0 in S (Rd).

Chapter 2
Deﬁnition 2.7. Continuous linear functionals on S (Rd) are called tempered
distributions.
The linear space of tempered distributions is denoted by
S ′(Rd). Thus T ∈S ′(Rd) if and only if T : S (Rd) →C is linear and
fn →f in S (Rd) implies that T(fn) →T(f) in C.
Example 2.8. For ﬁxed a ∈Rd, let δa be the map on S (Rd) given by the
prescription δa : f 7→f(a). Evidently δa ∈S ′(Rd). δa is called the Dirac
delta function (at a ∈Rd).
Remark 2.9. Since T(fn) −T(f) = T(fn −f) and fn →f in S if and only
if (fn −f) →0 in S , we see that a linear map on S is continuous if and
only if it is continuous at 0 ∈S .
Proposition 2.10. Suppose that T : S →S is linear and that there are
α, β ∈Zd
+ such that
|T(f)| ≤|||f|||α,β
for all f ∈S (Rd). Then T ∈S ′(Rd).
Proof. According to the remark above, we need only verify the continuity
of T at 0. But if fn →0 in S , it follows, in particular, that |||fn|||α,β →0
and so
|T(fn)| ≤|||fn|||α,β →0
as n →∞. This means that T is continuous at 0, as required.
To establish a converse, we shall introduce another family of norms on S .
Deﬁnition 2.11. For each k, m ∈Z+ and f ∈S (Rd), set
∥f∥k,m =
X
|α|≤k
|β|≤m
|||f|||α,β .
These norms on S have the property of being directed, that is, for any
(k′, m′) and (k′′, m′′) there is (k, m) such that
max{ ∥f∥k′,m′, ∥f∥k′′,m′′ } ≤∥f∥k,m
for all f ∈S (Rd). (Any (k, m) with k ≥max{ k′, k′′ } and m ≥max{ m′, m′′ }
will do).
Remark 2.12. It is clear that |||fn −f|||α,β →0 for each α, β ∈Zd
+ if and only
if ∥fn −f∥k,m →0 for each k, m ∈Z+. It follows that a linear functional
T on S (Rd) is a tempered distribution if and only if T(fn) →0 whenever
∥fn∥k,m →0 for all k, m ∈Z+.

Theorem 2.13. A linear functional T on S (Rd) is a tempered distribution if
and only if there is C > 0 and some k, m ∈Z+ such that
|T(f)| ≤C∥f∥k,m
for all f ∈S (Rd).
Proof. If such a bound exists, it is clear that T ∈S ′(Rd). For the converse,
suppose that T ∈S ′(Rd) but that there exists no such bound. Then for
any n ∈N, it is false that
|T(f)| ≤n ∥f∥n,n
for all f ∈S (Rd). In other words, there is a sequence (gn) in S such that
|T(gn)| > n ∥gn∥n,n .
Set fn = gn/n ∥gn∥n,n so that |T(fn)| > 1. However,
∥fn∥k,m = ∥gn∥k,m
n ∥gn∥n,n
≤1
n
whenever n ≥max{ k, m }. It follows that fn →0 in S (Rd). This is a
contradiction because it is false that T(fn) →0. The result follows.
Proposition 2.14. Let g ∈L2(Rd). Then the linear map
Tg : f 7→
Z
g(x) f(x) dx
on S (Rd) deﬁnes a tempered distribution.
Proof. For f ∈S (Rd), we have |Tg(f)| =

Chapter 2
The next result indicates that polynomially bounded functions determine
tempered distributions, via integration.
Theorem 2.15. Suppose that g(x) (is measurable and) is such that for some
m ∈N, Qd
j=1(1 + x2
j)−mg(x) is bounded on Rd. Then the map
Tg : f 7→
Z
g(x) f(x) dx
is a tempered distribution.
Proof. Let p(x) = Qd
j=1(1 + x2
j). Then the hypotheses mean that for any
f ∈S (Rd)
|g(x) f(x)| = p(x)−m |g(x)| p(x)m |f(x)|
< Mp(x)m |f(x)|
for some M > 0. It follows that g(x)f(x) is integrable and so Tg is well-
deﬁned on S (Rd).
To show that T ∈S ′(Rd), we estimate
|Tg(f)| < M

p(x)m |f(x)| dx

It follows that Tg ∈S ′(Rd).
Theorem 2.16 (Cauchy Principal Part Integral).
The functional

is
integrable on [0, ∞) and P( 1
x) is indeed well-deﬁned.

The result follows.
Deﬁnition 2.17. A sequence (Tn) in S ′(Rd) is said to converge in S ′(Rd)
if Tn(f) →T(f) for each f ∈S (Rd). One also says that Tn converges to T
in the sense of distributions.
Example 2.18. Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem implies that (if
each gn is measurable and) if gn(x) →g(x) pointwise and if |gn(x)| ≤ϕ(x)
for some integrable function ϕ, then
R
gn(x)f(x) dx →
R
g(x)f(x) dx for
each f ∈S . In other words, the sequence Tgn of tempered distributions
converges to Tg in S ′(Rd).
We wish to discuss the well-known formula

x −x0 + iε = P(

We will see that this holds with convergence in the sense of distributions.

Now, f(x)−f(−x)

side can be made arbitrarily small by choosing δ suﬃciently small. But for
ﬁxed δ > 0, the fact that f(x)−f(−x)

is integrable means that the second term
approaches 0 as ε →0. [Alternatively, one can set δ = √ε in the discussion
above. Another proof is to use Lebesgue’s Monotone Convergence Theorem
together with the fact that

The next theorem tells us that the Dirac delta function is the limit, in
the sense of distributions, of a sequence of functions whose graphs become
thin, tall peaks around x = 0.

(i) ϕn(x) ≥0 for all x ∈R.
(ii)
R
ϕn(x) dx = 1 for all n.

Then ϕn →δ in S ′(R) as n →∞(that is, Tϕn →δ in S ′(R)).
Proof. Fix f ∈S (R) (with f ̸≡0). To show that

To motivate the next deﬁnition, consider the integral
R
g′(x) f(x) dx
where f, g ∈S (R). Integrating by parts, we ﬁnd that
Z
g′(x) f(x) dx = −
Z
g(x) f′(x) dx .
Using our notation introduced earlier, identifying a function g with the
distribution Tg, this equality becomes
Tg′(f) = −T(g)(f′) .
If we think of Tg′ as the derivative of Tg, then the following deﬁnition is
quite natural.
Deﬁnition 2.24. Let T ∈S ′(Rd) and α ∈Zd
+. The weak derivative DαT
(or the derivative in the sense of distributions) is deﬁned by
(DαT)(f) = (−1)|α| T(Dαf)
for f ∈S (Rd).
This corresponds to DαTg = TDαg. Note that a distribution always has
a weak derivative. Of course, we should verify that the weak derivative of a
tempered distribution is also a tempered distribution. We do this next.
Theorem 2.25. For any α ∈Zd
+, Dα : S (Rd) →S (Rd) is continuous. In
particular, for any T ∈S ′(Rd), DαT ∈S ′(Rd) .
Proof. Suppose that fn →0 in S (Rd). Let γ, δ ∈Zd
+. Then

= ∥xγDδ+αfn∥∞

= |||fn|||γ,α+δ
→0
as n →∞. Hence Dα : S (Rd) →S (Rd) is continuous.
Now let T ∈S ′(Rd). Evidently DαT is well-deﬁned and is a linear map on
S (Rd). If fn →0 in S (Rd), then Dαfn →0 in S (Rd), by the ﬁrst part.
Hence
(DαT)(fn) = (−1)|α| T(Dαfn) →0
and so DαT ∈S ′(Rd), as required.

a(f) = −δa(f) = −f′(a).
2. Let g(x) =

Chapter 2
Remark 2.27. We notice that although δ is not a function, it is the second
distributional derivative of a continuous function, namely g. We will see
that every tempered distribution is the weak derivative (of a suitable order)
of some continuous function.
Deﬁnition 2.28. The support of a function f on Rd, denoted by supp f, is
the closure of the set where f does not vanish;
supp f = { x ∈Rd : f(x) ̸= 0 } .
Let C∞
0 (Rd) denote the linear subspace of C∞(Rd) of those functions with
compact support. Clearly C∞
0 (Rd) ⊂S (Rd).
Example 2.29. For x ∈R, let
h(x) =
(
e−1/(1−x2),
|x| ≤1
0,
|x| > 1 .
Then h is inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable and one ﬁnds that its nth derivative has
the form h(n)(x) = pn(x, 1/(1 −x2)) h(x) for some polynomial pn(s, t) and
therefore h ∈C∞
0 (R).
Let g(x) =
R x
−∞h(t) dt. Then g is inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable, g(x) = 0 for
x < −1 and g is constant for x > 1. Evidently g /∈S (R).
Let gλ(x) = g(λx), where λ > 0. Then gλ is zero for x < −1/λ and constant
for x > 1/λ. Now let gλ,a(x) = g(λ(x−a)). Then gλ,a vanishes for x < a−1
λ
and is constant when x > a + 1
λ.
Let a < b and suppose that λ, µ are such that a < a + 1
λ < b −1
µ < b. Let
f(x) = gλ,a(x) gµ,−b(−x). Then f ∈C∞(R) and we see that f(x) = 0 for
x < a −1
λ, f(x) = 0 for x > b + 1
µ and f is constant for a + 1
λ < x < b −1
µ.
Evidently f ∈C∞

In particular, if Nr(x0) denotes the open ball of radius r, centred at x0
in Rd, then there exist functions f ∈C∞
0 (Rd) such that f = 1 on Nr/2(x0)
and f vanishes outside Nr(x0).
Theorem 2.30. Let K be compact and let A be an open set in Rd with
KsubsetA.
Then there exists a C∞-function ϕ such that 0 ≤ϕ(x) ≤1
for all x ∈Rd, ϕ(x) = 1 for all x ∈K and ϕ(x) = 0 for x /∈A.
Proof. For each x ∈K, there is r(x) > 0 such that Nr(x)(x) ⊂A. The
collection { Nr(x)/2(x) : x ∈K } is an open cover of the compact set K and
so has a ﬁnite subcover, that is, there is x1, . . . , xm ∈K such that
K ⊂Nr1/2(x1) ∪· · · ∪Nrm/2(xm)
where ri = r(xi).
Let ϕi ∈C∞(Rd) be such that 0 ≤ϕi(x) ≤1, ϕi(x) = 1 for x ∈Nri/2(xi)
and ϕi(x) = 0 if x /∈Nri(x). (Such functions can be constructed as in the
previous example.)
Set
ϕ(x) = 1 −(1 −ϕ1(x))(1 −ϕ2(x)) . . . (1 −ϕm(x)) .
Then ϕ ∈C∞(Rd) and obeys 0 ≤ϕ(x) ≤1 for all x ∈Rd. Furthermore,
for any x ∈K, there is some 1 ≤i ≤m such that x ∈Nri/2(xi) and so
ϕi(x) = 1 and therefore ϕ(x) = 1.
On the other hand, for any x /∈A, it is true that x /∈Nri(xi) for all
1 ≤i ≤m (since Nri(xi) ⊂A). Hence ϕi(x) = 0 for all 1 ≤i ≤m and so
ϕ(x) = 1 −1 = 0. Therefore ϕ satisﬁes the requirements and the proof is
complete.
Theorem 2.31. C∞
0 (Rd) is dense in S (Rd).
Proof. Let ϕ ∈S (Rd) and let fn ∈C∞
0 (Rd) be a sequence of functions
such that supp fn ⊂{ x ∈Rd : |x| < n + 1 }, fn(x) = 1 for |x| ≤n −1
and such that the shape of the graph of fn for |x| between n −1 and n + 1
is independent of n. This means that for any given multi-index γ ∈Zd
+,
Dγfn(x) is bounded uniformly in n. (Such functions can be constructed as
in example 2.29).
Let ϕn = ϕ fn. Then ϕn ∈C∞
0 (Rd) and
|||ϕn −ϕ|||α,β = |||ϕ(fn −1)|||α,β
= sup
x≥n−1
| xα Dβ(ϕ(x)(fn(x) −1)) | .
But for each γ ∈Zd
+, ∥Dγ(fn(x) −1)∥∞is bounded uniformly in n and so it
follows by Leibnitz’ formula and the fact that ϕ ∈S that |||ϕn −ϕ|||α,β →0
as n →∞for each α, β ∈Zd
+.

Chapter 2
Deﬁnition 2.32. Let G be an open set in Rd. We say that a distribution T
vanishes on G if T(ϕ) = 0 for each ϕ ∈S (Rd) with supp ϕ ⊂G.
If g ∈S vanishes on G (as a function) then evidently
R
g(x) ϕ(x) dx = 0
for all ϕ ∈S with supp ϕ ⊂G, that is, Tg vanishes on G as a distribution.
Remark 2.33. Suppose that T ∈S ′(Rd) vanishes on the open sets G1 and
G2 where G1 ∩G2 = ∅. Then T also vanishes on G1 ∪G2. To see this, let
ϕ ∈S with supp ϕ ⊂G1 ∪G2.
Now supp ϕ ∩G1 is a closed set in G1 and so there is an inﬁnitely-
diﬀerentiable function f1 such that f1 = 1 on supp ϕ ∩G1 and f1 = 0
outside some closed set F1 containing supp ϕ ∩G1. Hence f1ϕ has support
in G1. Similarly, there is some f2 such that f2ϕ has support in G2.
But ϕ = f1ϕ + f2ϕ and therefore T(ϕ) = T(f1ϕ) + T(f2ϕ) = 0 since the
distribution T vanishes on both G1 and G2.
This result has a satisfactory generalization, as follows.
Theorem 2.34. Suppose that T ∈S ′(Rd) vanishes on each member of a
collection { Gα } of open sets. Then T vanishes on S
α Gα.
Proof. A proof of this result may be found in Rudin’s book1.
Thanks to this theorem, the following (desirable) deﬁnition makes sense.
Deﬁnition 2.35. For any T ∈S ′(Rd), let W denote the union of all open
sets on which T vanishes. The support of T is deﬁned to be supp T = W c,
the complement of W in Rd.
Examples 2.36.
1. One sees that supp δa = { a }, for any a ∈Rd.
2. If H is the Heaviside function, then we see that supp H = [0, ∞).

Chapter 3
The spaces D and D′
In this section, we consider another space of functions and the associated
collection of continuous linear functionals.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let Ω⊆Rd be an open subset of Rd. C∞
0 (Ω) denotes the
linear subset consisting of those functions in C∞
0 (Rd) which have support
in Ω. Suppose that (ϕn) is a sequence in C∞
0 (Ω) and let ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd). We
say that ϕn →ϕ in C∞
0 (Ω) if
(i) there is some compact set K ⊂Ωsuch that supp ϕn ⊂K for all n,
and
(ii) Dαϕn →Dαϕ uniformly as n →∞, for each α ∈Zd
+.
Note that it follows immediately that supp ϕ ⊂K.
D(Ω) is the space C∞
0 (Ω) equipped with this notion of convergence and we
say that ϕn →ϕ in D(Ω).
Example 3.2. Let ψ ∈C∞
0 (R) be such that ψ(x) = 0 for |x| > 1. For each
n ∈N, let ψn(x) = ψ(x −1) + 1
2 ψ(x −2) + · · · + 1
n ψ(x −n) (so that ψn
comprises n smaller and smaller smooth “bumps”).
Evidently, ψn ∈C∞
0 (R) and (ψn) is a Cauchy sequence with respect to
the norm ∥· ∥∞. Indeed, ∥ψn −ϕ∥∞→0 where ϕ(x) = P∞
k=1
1
k ψ(x −k).
Clearly ϕ ∈C∞(R) but ψ does not converge to ϕ in D(R) because the
supports of the ψn are not all contained in a compact set (and ϕ /∈C∞
0 (R),
anyway).
Continuing with this notation, let hn(x) = 1
n ψ(x−n). Then hn ∈C∞
0 (R)
and ∥hn∥∞→0 but (hn) does not converge to 0 in D(R) (because there is
no compact set K such that supp hn ⊂K for all n).
The notion of convergence in D ensures its completeness, as we show next.
Deﬁnition 3.3. We say that (ϕn) is a Cauchy sequence in D(Ω) if there is
some compact set K ⊂Ωsuch that supp ϕn ⊆K for all n and such that
∥Dα(ϕn −ϕm)∥∞→0 as n, m →∞for every α ∈Zd
+.

Chapter 3
Theorem 3.4. D(Ω) is complete.
Proof. Exactly as in the proof of the completeness of S , we see that if (ϕn)
is a Cauchy sequence in D(Ω), then there is some f ∈C∞(Rd) such that
∥Dα(ϕn −f)∥∞→0 for all α ∈Zd
+. But if supp ϕn ⊂K for all n, then it
follows that supp f ⊂K also. Hence f ∈C∞
0 (Ω) and ϕn →f in D(Ω).
Deﬁnition 3.5. A linear functional u : D(Ω) →C is said to be continuous
if u(ϕn) →u(ϕ) whenever ϕn →ϕ in D(Ω) as n →∞. Such a continuous
linear functional is called a distribution. The linear space of distributions is
denoted D′(Ω).
The derivatives of a distribution are deﬁned as for tempered distributions,
namely by the formula
Dαu(ϕ) = (−1)|α| u(Dαϕ)
for ϕ ∈D(Ω) and α ∈Zd
+.
Example 3.6. Clearly the map δa : ϕ 7→ϕ(a) (Dirac delta “function”) is a
distribution (i.e., belongs to D′(Rd)) for any a ∈Rd.
Example 3.7. Suppose u is a locally integrable function (that is, u ∈L1(K)
for each compact set K ⊂Rd). Then the map Tu : ϕ 7→
R
Rd u(x) ϕ(x) dx is
a distribution. (In particular, u(x) = ex2 deﬁnes a distribution, Tu ∈D′(R)
but Tu /∈S ′(R). Indeed, Tu is not deﬁned on every element of S (R).)
To see this, we ﬁrst note that Tu is well-deﬁned because ϕ has compact
support if it belongs to D(Rd). Furthermore,
|Tu(ϕ)| =

Z
u(x) ϕ(x) dx

≤
Z
K
|u(x)| |ϕ(x)| dx ,
where K = supp ϕ,
≤∥ϕ∥∞
Z
K
|u(x)| dx .
From this, we see that if ϕn →ϕ in D(Rd), then certainly Tu(ϕn) →Tu(ϕ)
so that Tu ∈D′(Rd), as claimed.
Remark 3.8. It is sometimes convenient to identify u with Tu and to consider
the function u as being a distribution (namely that given by Tu).
The next result tells us that every tempered distribution is a distribution.
(If this were not true then the terminology would be most inappropriate.)

Theorem 3.9. Let T ∈S ′(Rd). Then T ↾C∞
0 (Rd) ∈D′(Rd).
Proof. Suppose that ϕn →ϕ in D(Rd). Then there is some compact set
K ⊂Rd such that supp ϕn ⊂K for all n. So for any α, β ∈Zd
+
|||ϕn −ϕ|||α,β = ∥xαDβ(ϕn −ϕ)∥∞
= sup
x∈K
| xαDβ(ϕn −ϕ) |
≤Cα sup
x | Dβ(ϕn −ϕ) |
→0 ,
as n →∞,
where Cα is some constant such that |xα| < Cα for all x ∈K. It follows that
ϕn →ϕ in S (Rd) and so T(ϕn) →T(ϕ). Hence ϕ 7→T(ϕ) is continuous
on D(Rd).
Theorem 3.10. A linear functional u on C∞
0 (Ω) is a distribution if and only
if for each compact subset K ⊂Ωthere is a constant C and an integer N
such that
|u(ϕ)| ≤C |||ϕ|||N ,
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (K),
where |||ϕ|||N ≡P
|β|≤N ∥Dβϕ∥∞.
Proof. Clearly u is continuous on D(Ω) if such bounds hold. Conversely,
suppose that u ∈D′(Ω) but that no such bounds exist. Then there is some
compact set K0 ⊂Ωand a sequence (ϕn) in C∞
0 (K0) such that
|u(ϕj)| > j |||ϕj|||j ,
for all j ∈N.
Set fj = ϕj/u(ϕj) so that u(fj) = 1 for all j. However, for any β ∈Zd
+,
∥Dβfj∥∞= ∥Dβϕj∥∞
|u(ϕj)|
≤
|||ϕ|||j
|u(ϕj)| ,
for all j > |β|,
< 1
j →0 ,
as j →∞.
Hence fj →0 in D(Ω) which forces u(fj) →0. This contradicts the fact
that, by construction, u(fj) = 1 for all j. The result follows.
Remark 3.11. Note that the same proof works if the norm |||ϕ|||N above is
redeﬁned to be max|β|≤N ∥Dβϕ∥∞.
Deﬁnition 3.12. If the integer N in theorem 3.10 can be chosen independently
of K, then the distribution u is said to of ﬁnite order. The smallest such N
is called the order of u.

Chapter 3
Example 3.13. Let u ∈D′(R) be given by u = δ′, that is, u : ϕ 7→ϕ′(0).
Then we see that u has order 1.
On the other hand, if u = P∞
n=0 δ(n)
n
(where δ(n)
n (ϕ) = (−1)nϕ(n)(n)), then u is an element of D′(R) but its order
is inﬁnite.
Note that in this latter case, supp u = { 0, 1, 2, . . . }. We show next that
distributions with compact support must have ﬁnite order.
Theorem 3.14. Suppose that u ∈D′(Ω) and that supp u is compact. Then u
has ﬁnite order. In fact, there is C > 0 and N ∈Z+ such that
|u(ϕ)| ≤C |||ϕ|||N
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) (i.e., C does not depend on ϕ nor on supp ϕ).
Proof. Suppose that u ∈D′(Ω) and that supp u is compact. Let W be an
open set with supp u ⊂W and let ψ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) be such that ψ = 1 on W.
For any ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω), we have
u(ϕ) = u(ψ ϕ + (1 −ψ) ϕ) = u(ψ ϕ) + u((1 −ψ) ϕ) .
But (1−ψ) ϕ = 0 on W and so u((1−ψ) ϕ) = 0 and therefore u(ϕ) = u(ψ ϕ)
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω). It follows by theorem 3.10 that there is some C′ > 0
and N ∈Z+ such that
|u(ϕ)| = |u(ϕ ψ)| ≤C′ |||ϕ ψ|||N
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) (since supp ϕ ψ ⊆supp ψ). Note that C′ does not depend
on ϕ nor supp ϕ but may depend on supp ψ. An application of Leibnitz
formula implies that
|u(ϕ)| = |u(ϕ ψ)|
≤C′ |||ϕ ψ|||N
≤C |||ϕ|||N
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) for some C > 0 which may depend on ψ but does not
depend on ϕ nor on supp ϕ. The result follows.
Remark 3.15. The converse is false. Indeed, suppose that u(x) is a non-zero
constant, say u(x) = c ̸= 0, for all x ∈R. Then supp u = R which is not
compact. However, for any compact set K, and any ϕ ∈C∞
0 (K), we have
|u(ϕ)| =

Z
c ϕ(x) dx

≤|c| diam K ∥ϕ∥∞.
So u has order zero but its support is not compact.

Theorem 3.16. Let T ∈S ′(Rd). Then T ↾D(Rd) is a distribution of ﬁnite
order.
Proof. We have already seen that T ↾D(Rd) is a distribution, so we need
only show that it has ﬁnite order. Since T ∈S ′(Rd), there is C0 > 0 and
integers n, k ∈Z+ such that
|T(f)| ≤C0 ∥f∥n,k
for all f ∈S (Rd).
But if K ⊂Rd is compact, there is M > 0 such that |xα| ≤M for all α ∈Zd
+
with |α| ≤n and all x ∈K. Hence there is C′ > 0 such that
|T(f)| ≤C′ ∥f∥n,k ,
for all f ∈C∞
0 (K).
It follows that
|T(ϕ)| ≤C′ |||ϕ|||k
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (K), where k does not depend on K and so we see that the
order of T on D(Rd) is ﬁnite (no larger than k).
Remark 3.17. Again, the converse is false.
For example, the linear map
ϕ 7→
R
ex2 ϕ(x) dx deﬁnes an element of D′(R) which does not extend to a
continuous functional on S (R). However, for any compact set K ⊂R,
|u(ϕ)| ≤C |||ϕ|||0
for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (K) so that u has order 0. There is no T ∈S ′(R) such that
T ↾D(R) = u.
Theorem 3.18. Let u ∈D′(Rd) and suppose that supp u is compact. Then
u ∈S ′(Rd), that is, there is a unique T ∈S ′(Rd) such that T ↾D(Rd) = u.
Proof. Let W be an open ball in Rd with supp u ⊂W and let ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) be
such that W ⊂supp ψ and ψ = 1 on W. For any f ∈S (Rd), fψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd)
and so we may deﬁne the linear map T on S (Rd) by
T(f) = u(fψ)
for f ∈S (Rd).
Now, for any ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd), ϕ ψ = ϕ on W and so supp(ϕ ψ −ϕ) ⊆W c and
therefore u(ϕ ψ) = u(ϕ). It follows that T(ϕ) = u(ϕ) for any ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd).
Suppose that fn →0 in S (Rd). Then (using Leibnitz’ formula) it follows
that fnψ →0 in S (Rd). But supp fnψ ⊆supp ψ for all n and so fnψ →0
in D(Rd). This means that T(fn) = u(fnψ) →0 as n →∞and so T is
continuous on S (Rd), that is, T ∈S ′(Rd).
To see that T is unique, suppose that S ∈S ′(Rd) and S ↾D(Rd) = u.
Then S −T ∈S ′(Rd) and vanishes on C∞
0 (Rd) which is dense in S (Rd).
By continuity, it follows that S = T on S (Rd).

We know that δ and all its derivatives are distributions whose support is
the singleton set { 0 }. The next theorem gives a precise converse.
Theorem 3.19. Let u ∈D′(Rd) be such that supp u = { 0 }. Then there is
N ∈Z+ and constants aj such that
u =
X
|j|≤N
aj Djδ .
Proof. We will only give the proof for d = 1. The general case is similar.
So suppose that u ∈D′(R) with supp u = { 0 }. Since { 0 } is compact, it
follows that u has ﬁnite order, N, say. Then there is C > 0 such that
|u(ϕ)| ≤C |||ϕ|||N ,
for all ϕ ∈D(R).
Claim: if the derivatives ϕ(j)(0) = 0 for all 0 ≤j ≤N, then u(ϕ) = 0.
Proof of Claim. Let h ∈C∞
0 (R) be such that h(x) = 1 for |x| ≤1 and
such that h(x) = 0 if |x| ≥2. Set hn(x) = h(nx) so that hn(x) = 1 if
|x| ≤

n but hn(x) = 0 if |x| ≥
2
n. Let ϕn(x) = hn(x) ϕ(x). Evidently,
supp ϕn ⊆{ x : |x| ≤2 }.
We will show that |||ϕn|||N →0 as n →∞. Let k ∈Z+ be ﬁxed such that
0 ≤k ≤N and let ε > 0 be given. Since ϕ(k)(0) = 0, there is ρ > 0 such
that |ϕ(k)(x)| < ε for all |x| < ρ. But then

2/n < ρ, that is, n > 2/ρ. It follows that supx | Dkϕn(x) | →0 as n →∞
for each 0 ≤k ≤N and so |||ϕn|||N →0, as required.
To complete the proof of the claim, we note that the bound for u implies
that u(ϕn) →0. However, ϕ(x) −ϕn(x) = 0 if |x| < 1/n, and therefore
supp(ϕ −ϕn) ⊂{ x : |x| ≥1/n }.
Since supp u = { 0 }, it follows that
u(ϕ−ϕn) = 0 so u(ϕ) = u(ϕn) for all n which forces u(ϕ) = 0 and the claim
is proved.
To continue with the proof of the theorem, let ϕ ∈C∞
0 (R) be given and
deﬁne ψ by

Then ψ is inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable and ψ(k)(0) = 0 for all 0 ≤k ≤N. Note,
however, that ψ /∈C∞
0 (R) — indeed, ψ is not even bounded.
Let g ∈C∞
0 (R) be such that g(x) = 1 if |x| ≤1. Then u(ϕ) = u(ϕ g) and
ϕ g = p g + ψ g .
Now, ψ g ∈C∞
0 (R) and (by Leibnitz’ formula) we see that (ψ g)(k)(0) = 0
for all 0 ≤k ≤N and so u(ψ g) = 0, according to the claim above. Hence
u(ϕ) = u(ϕ g)

Theorem 3.21.

(ii) Suppose that ψ and its derivatives are polynomially bounded, that
is, for each multi-index α ∈Zd
+, there is some integer Nα ∈N and
constant Cα > 0 such that | Dαψ(x) | ≤Cα (1+|x|2)Nα for all x ∈Rd.
Then for any f ∈S (Rd), the function ψ f ∈S (Rd) and the map
ψ T : f 7→T(ψ f) deﬁnes a tempered distribution.
Proof. (i) For any ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω), the product ψ ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) also and so ψ u is
a well-deﬁned linear functional on D(Ω). Now if ϕn →ϕ in D(Ω), it follows
from Leibnitz’ formula that ψ ϕn →ψ ϕ in D(Ω) and so ψ u ∈D′(Ω), as
claimed.
(ii) If ψ and its derivatives are polynomially bounded, then ψ f ∈S (Rd)
for any f ∈S (Rd). Furthermore, again by Leibnitz’ formula, we see that if
fn →f in S (Rd), then also ψ fn →ψ f in S (Rd) and so ψT ∈S ′(Rd).

Chapter 4
The Fourier transform
We begin with the deﬁnition of the Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier
transform for smooth functions.
Deﬁnition 4.1. The Fourier transform of the function f ∈S (Rd) is the
function Ff given by
Ff(λ) =
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd e−iλ x f(x) dx
where λ ∈Rd and λ x = Pd
j=1 λj xj for x ∈Rd.
The inverse Fourier transform of f ∈S (Rd) is the function F −1f given by
F −1f(λ) =
1
(2π)d/2
Z
Rd eiλ x f(x) dx .
It is often convenient to also use the notation bf for Ff.
Of course, the terminology must be justiﬁed, that is, we must show that
these transforms really are inverses of each other.
Proposition 4.2. Let f ∈S (Rd). Then bf ∈C∞(Rd) and for any α, β ∈Zd
+
 (iλ)α Dβ bf

(λ) = ( Dα((−ix)β f(x)) )b(λ) .
In particular, iλj bf (λ) = (Djf)b(λ) and (Dj bf )(λ) = (−ixj f(x))b(λ).
Proof. Let e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), e2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , ed = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1)
denote the standard basis vectors for Rd. For f ∈S (Rd) and h ̸= 0,

since f ∈S (Rd). In other words, diﬀerentiation under the integral sign is
justiﬁed. Repeated diﬀerentiation (since xjf(x) ∈S (Rd)) shows that
(Dβ bf )(λ) =

Rd(−ix)β e−iλ x f(x) dx =

so that
( (iλ)α Dβ bf )(λ) = ( Dα( (−ix)β f(x) ) )b(λ)
and the proof is complete.
Remark 4.3. Clearly, similar formulae also hold for the inverse Fourier
transform F −1f (replacing i by −i).
Theorem 4.4. Both F and F −1 are continuous maps on S (Rd).
Proof. We ﬁrst show that if f ∈S (Rd), then so are Ff and F −1f. For any
α, β ∈Zd

| (λα Dβ bf )(λ) | =

It follows that ||| bf |||α,β = supλ∈Rd | (λα Dβ bf )(λ) | is ﬁnite for each pair of
multi-indices α, β ∈Zd

F −1f (or one can simply note that (F −1f)(λ) = (Ff)(−λ)).
To show that F : S (Rd) →S (Rd) is continuous, we use the estimate
obtained above. We have

From this, it follows that if fn →f in S (Rd), then c
fn →bf in S (Rd), that
is, the map F : S (Rd) →S (Rd) is continuous.
Similarly, one sees that F −1 is continuous on S (Rd).
The next theorem justiﬁes the terminology.
Theorem 4.5 (Fourier Inversion Theorem). For any f ∈S (Rd),
F −1(Ff) = f = F(F −1f)
(so that the Fourier transform F is a linear bicontinuous bijection of S (Rd)
onto S (Rd) with inverse F −1).
Proof. For any f, g ∈S (Rd), we have

Rd bg (x/ε) f(y + x) dx/εd

Chapter 4
Letting ε ↓0, we obtain
g(0)
Z
Rd
bf (λ) eiyλ dλ = f(y)
Z
Rd bg (x) dx .
Now set g(x) = e−x2/2. Then g(0) = 1 and one knows that bg (u) = e−u2/2
and
R
Rd bg (u) du = (2π)d/2. Substituting this into the equation above gives
(F −1bf )(y) = f(y) ,
that is, F −1(Ff) = f. Similarly, one shows that F(F −1f) = f and the
result follows.
Remark 4.6. We see that
(F 2f)(x) = (F bf )(x) = (F −1bf )(−x) = f(−x) .
It follows that F 4f = f so that F and F −1 have period 4.
Furthermore, writing the identity iλj bf (λ) = (Djf)b(λ) obtained earlier as
iλj (Ff)(λ) = (FDjf)(λ) and replacing f by F −1f, we get the formula
iλj f(λ) = (FDjF −1f)(λ). This gives the identity
iλj = FDjF −1
as operators on S (Rd).
We also ﬁnd that F −1(iλj)F = Dj and F(iλj)F −1 = F2DjF −2 = −Dj
on S (Rd).
Corollary 4.7 (Parseval’s formula). For any f, g ∈S (Rd)
Z
Rd
bf (x) bg (x) dx =
Z
Rd f(x) g(x) dx .
In particular, ∥bf ∥L2 = ∥f∥L2 (Plancheral’s formula).
Proof. We have seen that
Z
Rd g(λ) bf (λ) eiyλ dλ =
Z
Rd bg (x) f(y + x) dx .
Setting y = 0, we get
Z
Rd g(λ) bf (λ) dλ =
Z
Rd bg (x) f(x) dx .
Replacing f by F −1f and using the identity F −1f(x) = bf (−x), we obtain
Z
Rd g(x) f(x) =
Z
Rd bg (x) bf (−x) dx .

However, bf (x) = (f)b(−x), so putting h = f, we see that bf (−x) =
(h)b(−x) = bh (x). Hence
Z
Rd g(x) h(x) dx =
Z
Rd bg (x)bh (x) dx ,
as required.
It is now easy to see that the Fourier transform is a unitary operator on
the Hilbert space L2(Rd).
Theorem 4.8 (Plancherel). The Fourier transform F extends from S (Rd)
to a unitary operator on L2(Rd).
Proof. We have seen above (Plancherel’s formula) that the Fourier transform
F : S (Rd) →S (Rd) is isometric with respect to ∥· ∥2 (and maps S (Rd)
onto S (Rd)). However, S (Rd) is dense in L2(Rd) and so the result follows
by standard density arguments.
[ The details are as follows. Let h ∈L2(Rd). Then there is a sequence (fn) in S (Rd)
such that ∥fn −h∥2 →0. In particular, (fn) is L2-Cauchy. But ∥bϕ ∥2 = ∥ϕ∥2 for
ϕ ∈S (Rd) and so c
fn is also L2-Cauchy and therefore converges to some element,
F, say, in L2(Rd). We deﬁne Fh = F. Then
∥Fh∥2 = lim
n ∥c
fn ∥2 = lim
n ∥fn∥2 = ∥h∥2 .
To see that that F is independent of the particular sequence (fn), suppose that
(gn) is any sequence in S (Rd) such that ∥gn −h∥2 →0. Deﬁne a new sequence
(ϕn) in S (Rd) by setting
ϕn =
(
fn,
n odd
gn,
n even.
Arguing as above (but with ϕn rather than fn), we see that the sequence (c
ϕn )
converges in L2(Rd). But then
Fh = L2- lim
n
c
fn = L2- lim
n c
ϕn = L2- lim
n c
gn
so that Fh is well-deﬁned and ∥Fh∥2 = ∥h∥2.
A similar argument holds for the inverse Fourier transform F −1.
Moreover,
FF −1 and F −1F are both equal to the identity operator on S (Rd) which is dense
in L2(Rd) and so FF −1 = F −1F=1l on L2(Rd). ]
Corollary 4.9. For any f, g ∈L2(Rd), we have
Z
Rd
bf (x) g(x) dx =
Z
Rd f(x) bg (x) dx .
November 9, 2005

Chapter 4
Proof. The fact that F is unitary on L2(Rd) means that
Z
Rd
bf bg dx =
Z
Rd f g dx .
Replacing f by f and g by bg and using the facts that (Ff)(x) = (Ff)(−x)
and (FFg)(x) = g(−x) we see that
Z
Rd
bf (−x) g(−x) dx =
Z
Rd f(x) bg (x) dx
and the result follows.
Remark 4.10. The unbounded self-adjoint operator −iDj on the Hilbert
space L2(Rd) is unitarily equivalent to the operator of multiplication by xj.
This follows because F(−i)DjF −1 = xj on S (Rd) which is a core for the
multiplication operator xj.
Deﬁnition 4.11. The Fourier transform FT of the tempered distribution
T ∈S ′(Rd) is given by
FT(f) = T(Ff)
for f ∈S (Rd).
We often write bT for FT. Similarly, the inverse Fourier transform F −1T is
given by
F −1T(f) = T(F −1f)
for f ∈S (Rd).
Remark 4.12. Note that F:S (Rd) →S (Rd) is continuous and so the Fourier
transform F maps S ′(Rd) into S ′(Rd). Similarly, F −1T ∈S ′(Rd) for
every T ∈S ′(Rd). Evidently, F −1FT = T = FF −1T.
If T is given by some element g of L2(Rd), so T = Tg, then
FTg(f) = Tg( bf ) =
Z
Rd g(x) bf (x) dx =
Z
Rd bg (x) f(x) dx = T
bg (f) .
This means that we can think of the Fourier transform on S ′(Rd) as an
extension of that on L2(Rd).

Theorem 4.14. F and F −1 are continuous on S ′(Rd).
Proof. Suppose that Tn →T in S ′(Rd). Then Tn(ϕ) →T(ϕ) for every
ϕ ∈S (Rd). Hence
c
Tn (ϕ) = Tn(bϕ ) →T(bϕ ) = bT (ϕ)
so c
Tn →bT in S ′(Rd). A similar argument holds for the inverse Fourier
transform.
Theorem 4.15. For any T ∈S ′(Rd) and multi-indices α, β ∈Zd
+,
(ix)α bT = (DαT)b
and
Dβ bT = ( (−ix)βT )b.

f g = bf ∗bg
and
(2π)d/2 bf bg = [

Furthermore, f ∗g = g∗f and f ∗(g∗h) = (f ∗g)∗h for any f, g, h ∈S (Rd).

Chapter 5
Replacing f by F −1f and g by F −1g in this identity, we ﬁnd that
(2π)d/2 F(F −1f F −1g) = f ∗g
which shows that f ∗g ∈S (Rd) (because this is true of the left hand side).
The left hand side is unaltered if we interchange f and g and therefore
f ∗g = g ∗f .
Next, taking the Fourier transform once again gives
F(f ∗g)(y) = (2π)d/2 FF((F −1f)(F −1g))(y)
= (2π)d/2 ((F −1f)(F −1g))(−y)
= (2π)d/2 F −1f(−y) F −1g(−y)
= (2π)d/2 Ff(y) Fg(y)
and so F(f ∗g) = (2π)d/2 (Ff)(Fg), as claimed.
Finally, we have
F(f ∗(g ∗h)) = (2π)d/2 bf [
g ∗h
= (2π)d bf bg bh
= F((f ∗g) ∗h)
and therefore (taking the inverse Fourier transform) f ∗(g∗h) = (f ∗g)∗h.
Corollary 5.3. If ϕ, ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd), then ϕ ∗ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd). Moreover,
supp ϕ ∗ψ ⊆supp ϕ + supp ψ .
Proof. It follows from the theorem that ϕ ∗ψ ∈S (Rd) for ϕ, ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd).
Now
(ϕ ∗ψ)(y) =
Z
Rd ϕ(y −x) ψ(x) dx
which certainly vanishes if it is false that y−x ∈supp ϕ for some x ∈supp ψ,
that is, if it is false that y = x1 + x2 for some x1 ∈supp ϕ and x2 ∈supp ψ.
Hence supp ϕ ∗ψ ⊆supp ϕ + supp ψ, as required.
Moreover, each of supp ϕ and supp ψ is compact and so therefore is
supp ϕ ∗ψ. We conclude that ϕ ∗ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd).
Corollary 5.4. For ﬁxed f ∈S (Rd), the mapping g 7→f ∗g is continuous
from S (Rd) into S (Rd).
Proof. Fix f ∈S (Rd) and suppose gn →0 in S (Rd). Then also bgn →0
in S (Rd) and so (by Leibnitz’ formula) bf bgn →0 in S (Rd). But then
f ∗gn = (2π)d/2 F −1( bf bgn ) →0 in S (Rd) and the result follows.

Convolution

Deﬁnition 5.5. For any function u on Rd, we deﬁne the translation τxu and
the inversion eu by the formulae
(τxu)(y) = u(y −x)
and
eu (y) = u(−y) .
Then (τxeu )(y) = eu (y −x) = u(x −y) and for u, v ∈S (Rd), we have
(u ∗v)(y) =
Z
Rd u(x) v(y −x) dx =
Z
Rd u(x) (τyev )(x) dx .
One readily checks that for ﬁxed x ∈Rd, τx ande are continuous maps from
D(Rd) onto D(Rd) and from S (Rd) onto S (Rd).
Deﬁnition 5.6. For u ∈D′(Rd) and ϕ ∈D(Rd), the convolution u ∗ϕ is the
function
(u ∗ϕ)(x) = u(τx eϕ ) = u(ϕ(x −· )) .
For T ∈S ′(Rd) and f ∈S (Rd), the convolution T ∗f is the function
(T ∗f)(x) = T(τx ef ) = T(f(x −· )) .
Note that u(ϕ) can be expressed as a convolution.
Indeed, we see that
ϕ = (eϕ )e = τ0((eϕ )e). Hence u(ϕ) = u(τ0((eϕ )e)) = (u ∗eϕ )(0). Similarly,
T(f) = (T ∗ef )(0).
Lemma 5.7. For f ∈S (Rd) and κ ̸= 0, set fκ(x) = f(x + κej) −f(x)
κ
where e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , ed = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) are the standard basis
vectors of Rd. Then fκ →∂jf in S (Rd) as κ →0.
Proof. We shall show that |||fκ −∂jf|||α,β →0 for each α, β ∈Zd

Dβ(fκ −∂jf) = gκ −∂jg where g = Dβf, we may assume that β = 0.
For notational simplicity, let h = ∂jf ∈S (Rd) and let ∥x∥1 ≡Pd

Fix M suﬃciently large (according to the discussion above) so that each of
the second and third terms on the right hand side of the inequality (∗) is
smaller than 1
3 ε. The function h is uniformly continuous on the compact
set { x ∈Rd : ∥x∥1 ≤M } and so the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (∗)
is smaller than 1
3 ε for all |κ| suﬃciently small. The result follows.

Since f ∈S (Rd), for any given ε > 0, we may ﬁx M suﬃciently large that

3 ε.
But then for all suﬃciently small a, the ﬁrst term is also smaller than 1
3 ε
because f is uniformly continuous on { x ∈Rd : ∥x∥1 ≤M }. It follows that
supx | xα (f(x −a) −f(x)) | →0 as a →0. Replacing f by Dβf, we see that

Corollary 5.9. Suppose that ϕ ∈D(Rd). Then
(i) ϕκ →∂jϕ in D(Rd) as κ →0, and
(ii) τaϕ →ϕ in D(Rd) as a →0.
Proof. We have seen that ϕκ →∂jϕ in S (Rd) as κ →0 and that τaϕ →ϕ in
S (Rd) as a →0. However, for all |κ| < 1, say, there is some ﬁxed compact
set K such that each supp ϕκ ⊂K (and supp ∂jϕ ⊂K) which means that
ϕκ →∂jϕ in D(Rd) as κ →0.
Similarly, for all ∥a∥1 < 1, say, the supports of ϕ and τaϕ all lie within
some ﬁxed compact set and so τaϕ →ϕ in D(Rd) as a →0.
Theorem 5.10. Let u ∈D′(Rd) and let ϕ ∈D(Rd). Then u ∗ϕ ∈C∞(Rd)
and
Dα(u ∗ϕ) = (Dαu) ∗ϕ = u ∗(Dαϕ)
for any α ∈Zd
+. Furthermore, supp(u ∗ϕ) ⊆supp u + supp ϕ.
Proof. By the corollary, it follows that τy eϕ →τx eϕ in D(Rd) if y →x in Rd.
Hence u(τy eϕ ) →u(τx eϕ ), that is, (u ∗ϕ)(y) →(u ∗ϕ)(x) if y →x which
shows that u ∗ϕ is continuous on Rd.
Again, using the corollary, we see that for ﬁxed x ∈Rd,
(u ∗ϕ)(x + κej) −(u ∗ϕ)(x)

→u( τx(−Dj eϕ ) ) ,

Hence the partial derivative Dj(u ∗ϕ)(x) exists at each x ∈Rd and it is
equal to (u ∗Djϕ)(x). Furthermore, for ﬁxed x,
u( τx(−Dj eϕ ) ) = −u(Djτx eϕ )

and therefore
Dj(u ∗ϕ) = u ∗Djϕ = (Dju) ∗ϕ ,

For the last part, we note that (u∗ϕ)(x) = 0 if supp u∩supp τx eϕ = ∅, that
is to say, if supp u ∩supp ϕ(x −· ) = ∅. Hence
supp(u ∗ϕ) ⊆{ x ∈Rd : supp u ∩supp ϕ(x −· ) ̸= ∅}
= { x : there is y ∈supp u such that x −y ∈supp ϕ }
= { x : x ∈supp u + supp ϕ }
and the proof is complete.
Corollary 5.11. For u ∈D′(Rd) and ϕ ∈D(Rd), u ∗ϕ ∈D′(Rd).
Proof. The function u∗ϕ belongs to C∞and so is bounded on each compact
subset of Rd. Hence ψ 7→
R
Rd(u ∗ϕ)(x) ψ(x) dx is a continuous linear map
on D(Rd), that is, it is a distribution.
There is an analogous result for S and S ′.
Theorem 5.12. Let u ∈S ′(Rd) and f ∈S (Rd). Then u ∗f ∈C∞and
Dα(u ∗f) = (Dαu) ∗f = u ∗(Dαf)
for any α ∈Zd
+. Furthermore, u ∗f is polynomially bounded and hence
determines a tempered distribution.
Proof. The ﬁrst part is just as for D(Rd).
We need to show that u ∗f
is polynomially bounded. Since u ∈S ′(Rd), it follows that there is some
constant C > 0 and integers k, n such that
|u(g)| ≤C ∥g∥k,n

Theorem 5.14. Let u ∈D′(Rd) and let ϕ, ψ ∈D(Rd). Then
(u ∗ϕ) ∗ψ = u ∗(ϕ ∗ψ) .

We ﬁrst observe that the statement of the theorem makes sense

0 (Rd).
Let ε > 0 and consider the Riemann sum
fε(x) = εd X
κ∈Zd
ϕ(x −κε) ψ(κε) .
This is always a ﬁnite sum because the functions ϕ and ψ have compact
support. Furthermore, supp fε ⊆supp ϕ + supp ψ and fε ∈D(Rd). Now,
using the uniform continuity of Dαϕ, we see that
Dαfε(x) = εd X

Corollary 5.15. Let T ∈S ′(Rd) and let f, g ∈S (Rd). Then
( T ∗f ) ∗g = T ∗( f ∗g ) .
Proof. Since C∞
0 (Rd) is dense in S (Rd), there are sequences (ϕn) and (ψn)
in C∞
0 (Rd) such that ϕn →f and ψn →g in S (Rd). Furthermore, since
T ↾C∞
0 (Rd) ∈D′(Rd), it follows from the theorem that
( T ∗ϕn ) ∗ψk = T ∗( ϕn ∗ψk ) .
However, we know that (T ∗ϕn)(x) →(T ∗f)(x) uniformly on compact sets
in Rd and so, for ﬁxed y ∈Rd,
( (T ∗ϕn) ∗ψk )(y) = (T ∗ϕn)(τyf

Z
Rd(T ∗ϕn)(x) ψk(y −x) dx ,
since T ∗ϕn ∈C∞(Rd) (and is polynomially bounded),
→
Z
Rd(T ∗f)(x) ψk(y −x) dx ,
since supp ψk is compact,
= (T ∗f) ∗ψk(y) .
On the other hand, ϕn ∗ψk →f ∗ψk as n →∞in S (Rd) and so
(T ∗ϕn) ∗ψk = T ∗(ϕn ∗ψk) →T ∗(f ∗ψk) .
It follows that (T ∗f) ∗ψk = T ∗(f ∗ψk) for each k. But ψk →g in S (Rd),
so
(T ∗f) ∗ψk(y) = (T ∗f)(τyf
ψk ) →(T ∗f)(τyeg ) = (T ∗f) ∗g(y)
and
T ∗(f ∗ψk)(y) = T( τy( ^
f ∗ψk ) ) →T( τy(]
f ∗g ) ) = T ∗(f ∗g)(y) .
Hence (T ∗f) ∗g = T ∗(f ∗g), as required.

Theorem 5.16. Let g ∈S (Rd) be such that
R
Rd g(x) dx = 1 and for ε ̸= 0
set gε(x) = ε−dg(x/ε). Then for any f ∈S (Rd), gε ∗f →f in S (Rd),

Proof. It is enough to show that (gε ∗f)b →bf in S (Rd) (the result then
follows by taking the inverse Fourier transform). However, we know that
(gε ∗f)b = (2π)d/2 bgε bf so we must show that ((2π)d/2 bgε −1) bf →0 in
S (Rd), as ε →0.
Using Leibnitz’ formula together with the fact that λαDβ bf (λ) ∈S (Rd)
for any α, β ∈Zd
+, it is enough to show that

(So we see that bgε (λ) →bg (0) = (2π)−d/2 as ε →0.)
We consider two cases.
(i) Suppose |α| = 0. Fix ϕ ∈S (Rd). Then

Theorem 5.17. Let T ∈S ′(Rd) and let g ∈S (Rd) with
R
Rd g(x) dx = 1.
Then T ∗gε →T in S ′(Rd) as ε ↓0, where gε(x) = ε−d g(x/ε).
If u ∈D′(Rd) and ϕ ∈D(Rd) with
R
Rd ϕ(x) dx = 1, then u ∗ϕε →u in
D′(Rd) as ε ↓0, where ϕε(x) = ε−d ϕ(x/ε).
Proof. Fix f ∈S (Rd). Then
(T ∗gε)(f) = (T ∗gε) ∗ef (0)
= T ∗(gε ∗ef )(0)
→
ε→0 T ∗ef (0) ,
by the previous theorem,
= T(f)
which proves the ﬁrst part.
Next, we note that for given ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) and 0 < ε < 1, say, the supports
of ϕε ∗ψ and ψ all lie in some ﬁxed compact set (independently of ε). Hence
ϕε∗ψ →ψ in D(Rd) as ε ↓0. Arguing now as above, we deduce that for any
u ∈D′(Rd) and ψ ∈D(Rd), (u ∗ϕε)(ψ) →u(ψ) as ε ↓0, that is, u ∗ϕε →u
in D′(Rd).
Remark 5.18. The inﬁnitely-diﬀerentiable function T ∗gε is called the regu-
larization of T. This is easier to deal with than T itself, but of course, one
must eventually take the limit ε ↓0 in order to recover the distribution T.

and so γnu ∗ϕ1/n ∈C∞
0 (Rd). We claim that γnu ∗ϕ1/n →u in D′(Rd) as
n →∞.

out but maintains its general shape as it decreases from 1 to 0. The point is
that the λns and any derivatives are bounded independently of n. That is,
for any k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , there is Mk > 0 such that supn supt≥0 |λ(k)

To see this, ﬁrst we observe that γn(ϕ1/n ∗f) →f in S (Rd). This follows
from the inequalities
∥γn(ϕ1/n ∗f) −f∥α,β ≤∥γn(ϕ1/n ∗f −f)∥α,β + ∥γnf −f∥α,β

Remark 5.20. This result ties up the approach to distributions taken here
with the “generalized function” approach in which distributions are deﬁned
via sequences of functions in S (Rd). If T ∈S ′(Rd) and fn ∈S (Rd) is
such that fn →T in S ′(Rd), then the generalized function approach would
be to consider T to be the sequence (fn) (or strictly speaking, equivalence
classes of such sequences so as to allow for diﬀerent sequences in S (Rd)
which converge in S ′(Rd) to the same distribution). This is in the same
spirit as deﬁning real numbers via Cauchy sequences of rational numbers.
The next result tells us that, under the Fourier transform, convolution
becomes essentially multiplication.
Theorem 5.21. For any T ∈S ′(Rd) and f ∈S (Rd),
(i) F(T ∗f) = (2π)d/2 Ff FT and
(ii) FT ∗Ff = (2π)d/2 F(f T).
Proof. (i) We know that there is a sequence (ϕn) in C∞
0 (Rd) such that
ϕn →T in S ′(Rd). So for given g ∈S (Rd), we have
(T ∗f)b (g) = (T ∗f)( bg ) = (T ∗f) ∗f

Chapter 6
Fourier-Laplace Transform
We have seen that any tempered distribution has a Fourier transform which
is also a tempered distribution. We will see here, however, that the Fourier
transform of a distribution with compact support is actually given by a
function. By way of motivation, we note that the Fourier transform of an
integrable function u, say, is given by
bu (y) = (2π)−d/2
Z
Rd ey(x) u(x) dx
where ey denotes the function x 7→e−iyx for x ∈Rd. We cannot write this in
the distributional sense as Tu(ey) because the function ey does not belong to
D(Rd) (or S (Rd)). However, if u has compact support, then we can write
bu (y) = (2π)−d/2
Z
Rd ey(x) u(x) dx = (2π)−d/2
Z
Rd ey(x) ψ(x) u(x) dx
where ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) is chosen such that ψ = 1 on some open set containing
supp u. In this case, we see that
bu (y) = (2π)−d/2 Tu(ey ψ) .
This formula makes sense if y ∈Rd is replaced by any z ∈Cd. The following
deﬁnition seems appropriate.
Deﬁnition 6.1. Suppose that u ∈D′(Rd) and that u has compact support.
The Fourier-Laplace transform of u is the function bu (·) on Cd given by
bu (z) = (2π)−d/2 u(ez ψ)
where ez(x) = e−izx and ψ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) is such that ψ = 1 on some open
set W with supp u ⊂W.
47

48
Chapter 6
We note straightaway that ezψ ∈D(Rd) and that if W1 and W2 are
open sets with supp u ⊂W1 and supp u ⊂W2 and if ψ1 ∈C∞
0 (Rd) and
ψ2 ∈C∞
0 (Rd) are such that ψ1 = 1 on W1 and ψ2 = 1 on W2, then it
follows that u(ez ψ1) = u(ez ψ2) so that bu is a well-deﬁned function on Cd.
Furthermore, if u is given by an integrable function, then, as discussed above,
bu (y) is the Fourier transform of u.
Now, any element of D′(Rd) with compact support determines a tempered
distribution and for any u ∈S ′(Rd) we have already deﬁned its Fourier
transform as the tempered distribution bu : f 7→u( bf ). We can then ask
whether there is any relationship between the tempered distribution bu and
the function bu (x), x ∈Rd. If u is given by a square-integrable function, then
by Plancherel’s Theorem, Corollary 4.9, we ﬁnd that for any f ∈S (Rd),
u( bf ) =
Z
u(x) bf (x) dx =
Z
bu (x) f(x) dx .
This shows that in this case, the tempered distribution bu is indeed given by
the function bu (x). This is true in general, as we now show.
Theorem 6.2. Let u ∈D′(Rd) and suppose that u has compact support. Then
the Fourier-Laplace transform bu (z) is an entire function whose restriction
to Rd determines the tempered distribution bu , that is, bu ∈S ′(Rd) is given
by the function bu (·) ↾Rd.
Proof. Let ψ ∈C∞
0
be such that ψ = 1 on some open set W ⊂Rd with
supp u ⊂W. Then bu (z) = (2π)−d/2 u(ez ψ) for z ∈Cd and
ez(y) ψ(y) = e−izy ψ(y) =
X
α∈Zd
+
(−i)α
α!
zα yα ψ(y)
for any y ∈Rd. Since supp ψ is compact, it follows that for ﬁxed z ∈Cd
the partial sums converge uniformly in y and the same is true of any partial
derivatives (with respect to y). In other words, the partial sums converge
in D(Rd) and so
u(ez ψ) =
X
α∈Zd
+
(−i)α
α!
zα u(gα)
where gα ∈D(Rd) is the function gα(y) = yα ψ(y).
Moreover, u has ﬁnite order by Theorem 3.14, so that |u(ϕ)| ≤C |||ϕ|||N
for some constants C > 0 and N ∈Z+ and any ϕ ∈D(Rd). It follows that
|u(gα)| ≤C′R|α| for constants C′ and R (depending, of course, on u and
supp u). The series above for u(ez ψ) therefore converges absolutely for all
z ∈Cd and so u(ez ψ) is entire.

We must now show that bu , the tempered distribution, is given by the
function bu (x), x ∈Rd.
Now, u = u ψ as distributions, that is,
u(ϕ) = (ψ u)(ϕ) = u(ψ ϕ)
for all ϕ ∈S (Rd) and so
bu = (ψ u)b = (2π)−d/2 bu ∗bψ .
It follows that
bu (ϕ) =
Z
(2π)−d/2 (bu ∗bψ )(y) ϕ(y) dy ,
that is, bu is determined by the C∞-function (2π)−d/2 (bu ∗bψ )(x). Our aim
is to show that (2π)−d/2 (bu ∗bψ )(x) = bu (x). To see this, let ϕ ∈S (Rd) be
such that bϕ = ψ. Then
(bu ∗bψ )(x) = (bu ∗bbϕ )(x)
= (bu ∗eϕ )(x)
= bu (τxϕ)
= u( (τxϕ)b )
= u(ex bϕ )
= u(exψ)
= (2π)d/2 bu (x)
and the result follows.
Next we consider the relationship between the support of u and growth
properties of the function bu (z). We need a preliminary result.
Lemma 6.3. Suppose that f is analytic on Cd and vanishes on Rd. Then
f = 0 everywhere.
Proof. Let z1, z2, . . . , zd ∈Cd. Fix a2 ∈R, . . . , ad ∈R and consider the
map z 7→f(z, a2, . . . , ad). This is entire and vanishes on R and so vanishes
everywhere on C, by the Identity Theorem.
Since a2 ∈R is arbitrary,
we may say that f(z1, a2, . . . , ad) = 0 for all a2 ∈R. But then the map
z 7→f(z1, z, a3, . . . , ad) is entire and vanishes on R and so vanishes on C. In
particular, f(z1, z2, a3, . . . , ad) = 0 for any a3 ∈R.
Continuing in this way, we see that f(z1, z2, . . . , zd) = 0 and the result
follows.
For the following, let Kr denote the closed ball Kr = { x ∈Rd : |x| ≤r }.

0 (Rd) and that supp ϕ ⊆Kr.
Then
(1)
f(z) = (2π)−d/2
Z
Rd e−izt ϕ(t) dt, for z ∈Cd, is entire
and there are constants γN such that
(2)
|f(z)| ≤γN (1 + |z|)−N er |Im z| for z ∈Cd and N = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
(b) Conversely, if an entire function f satisﬁes (2), then there is some
ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) with supp ϕ ⊆Kr such that (1) holds.
Proof. (a) First note that if z = x + iy ∈Cd, then
|e−izt| = eyt ≤e|y| |t| ≤er| Im z|
for all t ∈Rd with |t| ≤r (and where | Im z| = (y2
1 + · · · + y2
d)1/2).
It
follows that e−izt ϕ(t) is integrable for each z ∈Cd. Moreover, for each ﬁxed
z ∈Cd, the power series expansion for e−izt converges uniformly for t ∈Kr
and therefore

Next, integrating by parts, we ﬁnd that

Z
ϕ(t) (iz)α e−izt dt

This, together with the inequality (1+|z|)N ≤(1+|z1|+· · ·+|zd|)N implies
that
(1 + |z|)N |f(z)| ≤γN er| Im z|
for a suitable constant γN, which is (2).
(b) Suppose that f is entire and satisﬁes the inequalities (2). For t ∈Rd, let
ϕ(t) = (2π)−d/2
Z
Rd f(x) eitx dx .
Since (1 + |x|)Nf(x) is bounded on Rd for any N (by (2)), it follows that ϕ
is a well-deﬁned function and that ϕ ∈C∞(Rd).
We wish to show that it is possible to replace x by x + iy in this formula
for ϕ without any other changes. To see this, let
I(η) =
Z ∞
−∞
f(x + iη, z2, . . . , zd) e(t1(x+iη)+t2z2+···+tdzd) dx
where t1, . . . , td ∈R, z2, . . . zd ∈C and η ∈R.
We shall show that I(η) = I(0) which shows that, in fact, I does not
depend on η. Let Γ be the (closed, simple) rectangular contour in C with
vertices at the points ±X and ±X + iη, where X > 0. Since the function
ζ 7→f(ζ, z2, . . . , zd) e(t1ζ+t2z2+···+tdzd) is analytic, it follows that
Z
Γ
f(ζ, z2, . . . , zd) e(t1ζ+t2z2+···+tdzd) dζ = 0 ,

by Cauchy’s Theorem. Now we use (2) to estimate the integrand along the
vertical sides of the rectangular contour Γ.
We have, with z = (±X + iy, z2, . . . , zd),

along the vertical sides of Γ converges to zero, as X →∞and so from (∗)
we conclude that I(0) −I(η) = 0, as required.

Now, let N ∈N be such that (1 + |x| )−N ∈L1(Rd).

together with the inequality (1 + |x + iy| )−N ≤(1 + |x| )−N, we ﬁnd that

Rd(1 + |x|)−N er|y| e−ty dx

|ϕ(t)| ≤C er|y|−ty
for any y ∈Rd. We shall show that this implies that supp ϕ ⊆Kr. Indeed,
let t ∈Rd be ﬁxed such that |t| > r. Setting y = λt with λ > 0, it follows
that ty = λ |t|2 and we see that
|ϕ(t)| ≤C eλ|t|(r−|t|)
for any λ > 0. Letting λ →∞, it follows that ϕ(t) = 0 and so we conclude
that supp ϕ ⊆Kr, as claimed.
By the Fourier inversion theorem, we have
f(x) = (2π)−d/2
Z
ϕ(t) e−ixt dt .
It follows that the entire function z 7→g(z) ≡
R
ϕ(t) e−izt dt agrees with f
on Rd and so, by the Lemma, f = g on Cd, that is, f is given as in (1) and
the proof is complete.
There is a version of this result for distributions, as follows.
Theorem 6.5.
(a) Suppose that u ∈D′(Rd) and that supp u ⊆Kr.
Then the Fourier-
Laplace transform f(z) = bu (z) is entire, its restriction to Rd is the
Fourier transform of u, and there is a constant γ > 0 such that
|f(z)| ≤γ (1 + |z| )N er|Im z|
(∗)
where N is the order of u.

(b) Conversely, if f is entire and satisﬁes (∗) for some N ∈N, some γ > 0
and r > 0, then f(z) = bu (z) for some u ∈D′(Rd) with supp u ⊆Kr.
Proof. (a) We have already proved everything except for the estimate (∗).
Let h ∈C∞(R) be such that h(s) = 1 when s ≤1 and h(s) = 0 for all s ≥2.
For given z ∈Cd (with z ̸= 0), let
χ(x) = h( |x| |z| −r |z| ) .
Then χ ∈C∞(R) and χ(x) = 0 whenever |x| |z|−r |z| > 2, that is χ vanishes
whenever |x| >
2
|z| +r. So χ ∈C∞
0 (R) with supp χ ⊆Kr+2/|z|. Furthermore,
if |x| < r + 1
|z|, then χ(x) = 1 and so bu (z) = u(ezχ) (since χ = 1 on some
open set W with sup u ⊂W).
By hypothesis, supp u is compact and so u has ﬁnite order, say N. Then
there is C > 0 such that
| u(ezχ) | ≤C
X
|α|≤N
∥Dα(e−izxχ(x))∥∞.
Now ∂h/∂xj = |z| xj
|x| h′(|x| |z| −r |z|) and so for any α, β ∈Zd
+, we have

≤|z||α|+|β| ∥D|β|h ∥∞er|Im z|+2
(since |Im z| ≤|z|) .
Hence, by Leibnitz’ formula, we conclude that
|bu (z)| ≤γ (1 + |z| )N er|Im z|
for a suitable constant γ.
(b) Suppose that f satisﬁes |f(x)| ≤γ(1 + |x| )Ner Im z for some constants
γ, r > 0 and some N ∈N. Then the map from S →C given by
ϕ 7→f(ϕ) =
Z
f(x) ϕ(x) dx
is a tempered distribution.
Hence there is some T ∈S ′(Rd) such that
bT = f (namely, T = F −1f). We will show that supp T ⊆Kr and that
f(z) = bT (z).
The idea is to regularize T and apply the Paley-Wiener
theorem for functions.

Chapter 6
Let g ∈C∞
0 (Rd) be such that supp g ⊂K1 and
R
g(x) dx = 1. For ε > 0,
set gε(x) = e−d g(x/ε). Then supp gε ⊂Kε and we have seen that for any
tempered distribution S ∈S ′(Rd), it is true that S ∗gε →S in S ′(Rd) as
ε ↓0. Now
T ∗gε = (F −1f) ∗gε = F −1((2π)d/2 bgε f)
since (S ∗ϕ)b = (2π)d/2 bϕ bS , for any ϕ ∈S (Rd) and S ∈S ′(Rd). Since
supp gε ⊆Kε, the Paley-Wiener Theorem implies that bgε is entire and that
for any integer k there is a constant γk such that
| bgε (z) | = | (2π)−d/2
Z
gε(y) e−izy dy |
≤γk (1 + |z| )−k eε |Im z|
for any z ∈Cd. But, by hypothesis,
|f(z)| ≤γ (1 + |z| )N er |Im z|
and so, for any integer m,
| bgε (z) f(z) | ≤γN+mγ (1 + |z| )−N−m (1 + |z| )N e(r+ε) |Im z|
= γN+mγ (1 + |z| )−m e(r+ε) |Im z|
for z ∈Cd.
Again, by the Paley-Wiener Theorem, it follows that there is ϕε ∈C∞
0 (Rd)
with supp ϕε ⊆Kr+ε such that
bgε (z) f(z) = (2π)−d/2
Z
e−izt ϕε(t) dt .
In particular, bgε (x) f(x) ∈S (Rd) and is the Fourier transform of ϕε. That
is, F −1( bgε f) = ϕε as functions and so therefore as tempered distributions.
Now, let ψ ∈S (Rd) be such that supp ψ ∩Kr = ∅. Then, for all ε > 0
suﬃciently small, supp ψ ∩Kr+ε = ∅and therefore
R
ϕε(x) ψ(x) dx = 0 for
small ε. It follows that
T(ψ) = lim
ε↓0 T ∗gε(ψ)
= lim
ε↓0 (2π)d/2
Z
ϕε(x) ψ(x) dx
= 0
and so supp T ⊆Kr, as required.
It remains to verify that bT (z) = f(z) on Cd. However, bT is entire and
bT (x) is the Fourier transform of T, bT (x) = f(x) for x ∈Rd.
But, by
hypothesis, f is entire and so bT = f on Rd means that bT = f on Cd and
the proof is complete.

Chapter 7
Structure Theorem for Distributions
Any polynomially bounded continuous function certainly determines a tem-
pered distribution.
It turns out that such functions, together with their
distributional derivatives exhaust S ′(Rd), as we discuss next.
Theorem 7.1. Let T ∈S ′(Rd). Then there is a continuous polynomially
bounded function F(x) and a multi-index α ∈Zd
+ such that T = DαF.
Proof. For notational convenience, we shall only consider the one-dimensional

given by
J(ϕ) = (1 + x2)kϕ(x) ⊕(1 + x2)kDϕ(x) ⊕· · · ⊕(1 + x2)kDm+1ϕ(x) .
Note that J is one-one, because if J(ϕ) = J(ψ), then, in particular, the
ﬁrst components agree and so (1 + x2)kϕ(x) = (1 + x2)kψ(x) which means
that ϕ = ψ. It is also clear that J is a linear map. Now we deﬁne the map
Λ : J(C∞
0 (R)) →C by setting
Λ(J(ϕ)) = T(ϕ) .
Then Λ is well-deﬁned, since J(ϕ) is uniquely determined by ϕ, and is linear.
Moreover, the bound (∗) implies that Λ is a bounded linear functional on
J(C∞
0 (R)) when considered as a subspace of (L1(R))m+2.
By the Hahn-Banach theorem, Λ has an extension to a bounded linear
functional on the whole of (L1(R))m+2. But then Λ must have the form

Then u = χu on C∞

Chapter 8
Partial Diﬀerential Equations
We will make a few sketchy remarks in this last chapter. We have seen that
every distribution is diﬀerentiable (in the distributional sense) and so we can
consider (partial) diﬀerential equations satisﬁed by distributions. Indeed, we
might expect a diﬀerential equation to have a distribution as solution rather
than a function.
Example 8.1. Consider the diﬀerential equation u′ = H where
H(x) =
(
0,
x < 0
1,
x ≥0
is the Heaviside step-function.
For x < 0, u′(x) = 0, so u(x) = a and
for x > 0, u′(x) = 1 giving u(x) = x + b, for suitable constants a and b.
However, continuity of u at x = 0 would require u(0) = a = b and so
u(x) =
(
a,
x < 0
1,
x + a ≥0.
But such u is not diﬀerentiable at x = 0 and so cannot satisfy the original
diﬀerential equation at this point.
However, for any ϕ ∈S (R), we see
that u′(ϕ) = H(ϕ), that is, u is a distributional solution to the diﬀerential
equation. Indeed, integrating by parts, we get
u′(ϕ) = −u(ϕ′) = −

Notation. Suppose that P(x1, . . . , xd) is a polynomial in d-variables. Then
the symbol P(D) denotes the partial diﬀerential operator obtained after the
substitution Dj =
∂
∂xj for xj in the polynomial expression P(x, . . . , xd). For
example, if P(x1, . . . , xd) = x3
1 + x3x4, then P(D) =
∂3
∂x3
1 +
∂2
∂x3∂x4 .
For a given function g on Rd and polynomial P, a distributional solution
u ∈D′(Rd) to the partial diﬀerential equation P(D)u = g is called a weak
solution. We have seen above that a partial diﬀerential equation may possess
a weak solution but no solution in the classical sense. Notice that a partial
diﬀerential equation such as P(D)u = g is meaningful even if g ∈D′(Rd).
Of particular interest is the case for which g = δ.
Deﬁnition 8.2. A distribution E ∈D′(Rd) satisfying the partial diﬀerential
equation P(D)E = δ is said to be a fundamental solution for the partial
diﬀerential operator P(D).
The importance of fundamental solutions is their part in the solution of
inhomogeneous partial diﬀerential equations of the form P(D)u = g, with
g ∈C∞
0 (Rd). Indeed, if we set u = E ∗g, where E is a fundamental solution
for P(D), then u ∈C∞
0 (Rd) and we ﬁnd that
P(D)u = P(D)(E ∗g)
= (P(D)E ) ∗g
= δ ∗g
= g ,
that is, P(D)u = g. So E ∗g is a solution in the classical sense.

We claim that a fundamental solution for ∆is E = −

so P(D)E = δ, as claimed.
Of course, one might enquire as to the existence of fundamental solutions.
We state the following theorem, without proof.
Theorem 8.5 (Malgrange-Ehrenpreis). For every constant coeﬃcient partial
diﬀerential operator P(D) on Rd, there is a distribution E ∈D′(Rd) such
that P(D)E = δ.
Suppose now that we can show that a particular partial diﬀerential equation
has a weak solution. Is it possible to show that under certain circumstances
this solution is actually a solution in the classical sense? A result in this
vein is the following.
Theorem 8.6. Let Ω⊂Rd be an open set and suppose that u and f are
continuous on Ωand that Dju = f as distributions. Then Dju = f in the
classical sense, that is, Dju exists (as a function) and is equal to f on Ω.
Proof. Let W be any open ball in Ωand let χ ∈C∞
0 (Ω) be such that χ = 1
on W.
Then χu is continuous and has compact support.
Also, for any
ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω),
(Dj(χu))(ϕ) = −(χu)(Djϕ)
= −u(χDjϕ)
= −u(Dj(χϕ)) + u(Djχ ϕ)
= (Dju)(χϕ) + u(Djχ ϕ)
= (χDju)(ϕ) + ((Djχ)u)(ϕ) ,
that is, Dj(χu) = (Djχ)u + χ(Dju), as distributions.
Let v = χu and g = Djv = (Djχ)u + χ(Dju). Then g = (Djχ)u + χf
since Dju = f. So g is continuous, as is v and both v and g have compact
support. We have shifted the problem to the case of compact support.
Let ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd) be such that ϕ ≥0 and

ϕ(y) dy = 1. For ε > 0 let
vε(x) =

Then vε ∈C∞(Rd) and vε →v uniformly as ε ↓0. Also,

It follows that gε = Djvε →g uniformly as ε ↓0. Let e1, . . . , ed denote the
usual orthonormal basis vectors for Rd (so that ej = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0),
with the 1 in the jth coordinate position). Then
vε(x + λej) −vε(x) =

Letting ε ↓0, we deduce that
v(x + λej) −v(x) =

g(y) dyj
and hence Djv exists and Djv(x) = g(x). But for any x ∈W, we have
v(x) = χ(x)u(x) = u(x) and Djv(x) = Dju(x) and g(x) = f(x). It follows
that Dju exists on W and Dju = f on W. Since W is arbitrary, the result
follows.
Deﬁnition 8.7. Let P(D) = P
|α|≤m aαDα be a linear diﬀerential operator
of order m, with constant coeﬃcients, deﬁned on Rd. Then the polynomial
P(ξ) = P
|α|≤m aαξα is called the symbol of P. The sum of those terms of
order m in P(ξ) is called the principal symbol of P, denoted σP , that is,
σP (ξ) =
X
|α|=m
aαξα .
Note that σP is homogeneous of degree m. The diﬀerential operator P(D)
is said to be elliptic if σP (ξ) ̸= 0 for all 0 ̸= ξ ∈Rd.
Examples 8.8.
1. ∆is elliptic on Rd.
2. ∂1 + i∂2 is elliptic on R2.

Chapter 8
Theorem 8.9 (Elliptic Regularity). Let Ω⊆Rd be an open set and let P(D)
be an elliptic diﬀerential operator (constant coeﬃcients). If v ∈C∞(Ω) and
u ∈D′(Ω) is a weak solution to P(D)u = v, then u ∈C∞(Ω).
In particular, every weak solution to the homogeneous partial diﬀerential
equation P(D)u = 0 belongs to C∞(Ω).
We will not prove this here.
Example 8.10. Suppose that P(D) is elliptic (constant coeﬃcients) and that
E is a fundamental solution: P(D) = δ. Then P(D)E = 0 on Rd \ { 0 },
that is (P(D)E)(ϕ) = 0 for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Rd \ { 0 }). So E ∈C∞
0 (Rd \ { 0 }).
Example 8.11. Let Ωbe an open set in R2 and suppose that u ∈D′(Ω)
satisﬁes (∂1 + i∂2)u = 0 on Ω. Since ∂1 + i∂2 is elliptic, the theorem tells
us that u ∈C∞
0 (Ω). But then (∂1 + i∂2)u = 0 is just the Cauchy-Riemann
equations and so we conclude that u is analytic in Ω. (Note that ∂1u and ∂2u
are continuous because u ∈C∞.) In other words, an analytic distribution
is an analytic function.
Deﬁnition 8.12. For s ∈R, the Sobolev space Hs(Rd) is deﬁned to be the
set of tempered distributions T ∈S ′(Rd) such that bT is a function with the
property that
R
| bT (λ)|2 (1 + |λ|2)s dλ < ∞. Evidently, Hs ⊇Ht if s ≤t.
Hs is a Hilbert space with respect to the inner product
(T1, T2) =
Z
c
T1 (λ) c
T2 (λ) (1 + |λ|2)s dλ .
Deﬁnition 8.13. Let Ω⊆Rd be an open set. The local Sobolev space Hs(Ω),
for s ∈R, is the set of distributions u ∈D′(Ω) such that ϕu ∈Hs(Rd) for
all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω).
The Sobolev spaces are used in the proof of the elliptic regularity theorem.
In fact, one can prove the following stronger version.
Theorem 8.14 (Elliptic Regularity). Let Ω⊆Rd be open and let P(D) be an
elliptic operator of order N. Suppose that P(D)u = v where v ∈Hs(Ω) for
some s ∈R. Then u ∈Hs+N(Ω).
The theorem says that u is “better behaved” than v (by order N).
If v ∈C∞(Ω), then ϕv ∈C∞
0 (Ω) for all ϕ ∈C∞
0 (Ω). Hence ϕv ∈S (Rd)
and so (ϕv)b ∈S (Rd) and therefore ϕv ∈Hs(Ω) for all s. Hence u ∈Hs(Ω)
for all s.
One then shows that this implies that u ∈C∞(Ω) (Sobolev’s
Lemma).
