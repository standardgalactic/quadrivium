THE SPECIFICATIONS AND INFORMATION REGARDING THE PRODUCTS IN THIS MANUAL ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT 
NOTICE. ALL STATEMENTS, INFORMATION, AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS MANUAL ARE BELIEVED TO BE ACCURATE BUT 
ARE PRESENTED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USERS MUST TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THEIR APPLICATION OF ANY PRODUCTS.
THE SOFTWARE LICENSE AND LIMITED WARRANTY FOR THE ACCOMPANYING PRODUCT ARE SET FORTH IN THE INFORMATION 
PACKET THAT SHIPPED WITH THE PRODUCT AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY THIS REFERENCE. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO 
LOCATE THE SOFTWARE LICENSE OR LIMITED WARRANTY, CONTACT YOUR CISCO REPRESENTATIVE FOR A COPY.
The following information is for FCC compliance of Class B devices: The equipment described in this manual generates and may radiate 
radio-frequency energy. If it is not installed in accordance with Cisco’s installation instructions, it may cause interference with radio and television 
reception. This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device in accordance with the specifications in 
part 15 of the FCC rules. These specifications are designed to provide reasonable protection against such interference in a residential installation. 
However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. 
Modifying the equipment without Cisco’s written authorization may result in the equipment no longer complying with FCC requirements for Class 
A or Class B digital devices. In that event, your right to use the equipment may be limited by FCC regulations, and you may be required to correct 
any interference to radio or television communications at your own expense.
You can determine whether your equipment is causing interference by turning it off. If the interference stops, it was probably caused by the Cisco 
equipment or one of its peripheral devices. If the equipment causes interference to radio or television reception, try to correct the interference by 
using one or more of the following measures:
• Turn the television or radio antenna until the interference stops.
• Move the equipment to one side or the other of the television or radio.
• Move the equipment farther away from the television or radio.
• Plug the equipment into an outlet that is on a different circuit from the television or radio. (That is, make certain the equipment and the television 
or radio are on circuits controlled by different circuit breakers or fuses.) 
Modifications to this product not authorized by Cisco Systems, Inc. could void the FCC approval and negate your authority to operate the product.

An Overview of the Cisco IP Phone
The Cisco IP Phone provides functionality similar to that of a traditional analog 
phone, but must be configured and managed like other network devices.
You can choose among three models of Cisco IP Phones—Cisco IP Phone 7960, 
Cisco IP Phone 7940, and Cisco IP Phone 7910. Each Cisco IP Phone supports 
G.711 and G.729a audio compression.

Understanding the Cisco IP Phone Models 
7960 and 7940
The Cisco IP Phone models 7960 and 7940 are full-featured, multiline telephones 
that provide voice communication over an IP network. These phones function as 
managerial-level office telephones, replacing traditional analog telephones in an IP 
telephony network. 
The Cisco IP Phone model 7960 and 7940 differ only in the number of available 
line or speed dial buttons. The Cisco IP Phone 7940 has two lines, and the 7960 
has six lines.
The main components of both models are illustrated in and Figure 1-1 and 
Figure 1-2, and defined in the table that follows.

Table 1-1
Supported Networking Protocols on the Cisco IP Phone
Networking Protocol
Purpose
Usage Notes
Voice over IP Protocol 
(VoIP)
VoIP enables you to transfer voice 
communications over a data network 
using the Internet Protocol.
Cisco IP Phones connect to the 
PSTN through a VoIP gateway.
Bootstrap Protocol 
(BootP)
BootP enables a network device such as 
the Cisco IP Phone to discover certain 
startup information, such as its IP 
address.
If you are using BootP to assign 
IP addresses to the 
Cisco IP Phone, this is displayed 
in the network configuration 
settings on the phone.
Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP)
DHCP dynamically allocates and assigns 
an IP address to network devices.
DHCP enables you to connect the IP 
phone into the network and become 
operational without manually assigning 
an IP address or configuring additional 
required network parameters.
DHCP is enabled by default. If 
disabled, you must manually 
configure the IP address, subnet 
mask, gateway, and an TFTP 
server on each phone locally.

 
Chapter 1      An Overview of the Cisco IP Phone
What Networking Protocols Are Used?
1-8
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Internet Protocol (IP)
IP is a messaging protocol that addresses 
and sends packets across the network.
To communicate using IP, 
network devices must have an 
assigned IP address, subnet, and 
gateway. 
IP addresses, subnets, and 
gateways identifications are 
automatically assigned if you are 
using the Cisco IP Phone with 
Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP). If you are not 
using DHCP, you must manually 
assign these properties to each 
phone locally.
Trivial File Transfer 
Protocol (TFTP)
TFTP allows you to transfer files over the 
network. 
On the Cisco IP Phone, TFTP enables 
you to obtain a configuration file specific 
to the phone type.
TFTP requires a TFTP server in 
your network, which can be 
automatically identified from the 
DHCP server. If more than one 
TFTP server is running in your 
network, you must manually 
assign a TFTP server to each 
phone locally.
Cisco Discovery 
Protocol (CDP)
CDP is a device-discovery protocol that 
runs on all Cisco-manufactured 
equipment.
Using CDP, a device can advertise its 
existence to other devices and receive 
information about other devices in the 
network.
The Cisco IP Phone uses CDP to 
communicate information such as 
auxiliary VLAN ID, per port 
power management details, and 
Quality of Service (QoS) 
configuration information with the 
Cisco Catalyst switch.
Real-Time Transport 
(RTP)
RTP is a standard for transporting 
real-time data, such as interactive voice 
and video over data networks.
Cisco IP Phones can collect and 
process RTP traffic from routers, 
hubs, and switches.

Chapter 1      An Overview of the Cisco IP Phone
What Types of Connections are Available?
In addition to providing documentation, it is important to inform users of 
available Cisco IP Phone features—including those specific to your company or 
network—and how to access and customize those features, if appropriate. 
Tip
For a summary of some of the key information that phone users need their 
system administrators to provide, see the “System Administrator Checklist” 
section on page 6-6.
What Types of Connections are Available?
The Cisco IP Phone includes ports for connecting to the network, a power source, 
and a headset. 
This section covers the following topics:
•
Connecting to the Network, page 1-11
•
Providing Power to the Cisco IP Phone from Multiple Sources, page 1-12
Connecting to the Network
The Cisco IP Phones have two RJ-45 ports labelled “network” and “access.” Each 
supports 10/100 Mbps half- or full-duplex connections to external devices. You 
can use either Category 3 or 5 cabling for 10-Mbps connections, but you must use 
Category 5 for 100 Mbps connections. On both the network port and access port, 
use full-duplex mode to avoid collisions.
Note
The Cisco IP Phone 7910 does not have an access port. If you require an access 
port on this phone model, use the Cisco IP Phone 7910+SW instead.
Refer to Figure 3-1 and Figure 3-2 to see the connection ports available on the 
back of the Cisco IP Phone models 7960/7940 and 7910.

 
Chapter 1      An Overview of the Cisco IP Phone
What Types of Connections are Available?
1-12
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Using the Network Port
Use the network port to connect the phone to the network. You must use a 
straight-through cable on this port. The phone can also obtain inline power from 
the Cisco Catalyst switch over this connection. See the “Providing Power to the 
Cisco IP Phone from Multiple Sources” section on page 1-12 for details.
Using the Access Port
Use the access port to connect a network device, such as a computer, to the phone. 
You must use a straight-through cable on this port.
Providing Power to the Cisco IP Phone from Multiple Sources
You can power a Cisco IP Phone from an external power supply, from a switch 
port, or from a power source between the phone and the switch. 
The Cisco IP Phone can be powered by the following sources:
•
External power source—optional Cisco AC adapter and power cord for 
connecting to a standard wall receptacle.
•
WS-X6348-RJ45V 10/100 switching module—inline power provider to the 
Cisco IP Phone when connected to a Catalyst 3500, 4000, or 6000 family 
10/100BaseTX switching module.
This module sends power on pins 1 & 2 and 3 & 6, which are also used to 
transmit Ethernet signals. Before the switch sends power, it tests for the 
presence of a Cisco IP Phone, avoiding damage to other Ethernet devices.
Note
Only the network port supports inline power from the Cisco 
Catalyst switches.
•
WS-PWR-PANEL—power patch panel that allows the Cisco IP Phone to be 
connected to existing Catalyst 4000, 5000, and 6000 family 10/100BaseTX 
switching modules.
This module sends power on pins 4, 5, 7, & 8, which are not used for Ethernet 
signaling. Like the inline power, the power patch panel also attempts to verify 
that the attached device is a Cisco IP Phone before providing power.

Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Chapter 1      An Overview of the Cisco IP Phone
What Types of Connections are Available?
Power Source Design
The phone and switch automatically determine which power source the phone 
uses. If the power has to be switched to a different source, the phone user will 
experience different results based on which power source is being used by the 
phone.
•
If you plug a phone into the optional power supply before plugging it into the 
network, the phone is powered by the power supply.
•
If you then unplug the phone from the power supply, the phone resets. If the 
switch port is configured for 10/100 Mbps, the switch recognizes the loss of 
power and brings the phone back up.
•
If the switch port is configured for 10 Mbps only, then you must unplug the 
network connection and replug it into the phone for the switch to recognize 
the phone’s loss of power.
•
If, however, you plugged the network connection into the phone before you 
plugged in the power cord, the phone receives power through the switch, and 
unplugging the power cord will not bring down the phone. If the switch 
reboots, the phone will then be powered by the power cord.
Redundancy Feature
For redundancy, you can use the Cisco AC adapter even if you are using inline 
power from the Cisco Catalyst switches. The Cisco IP Phone can share the power 
load being used from the inline power and external power source. If either the 
inline power or the external power goes down, the phone can switch entirely to the 
other power source.
To use this redundancy feature:
1.
Set the inline power mode to auto on the Cisco Catalyst switch.
2.
Connect the unpowered Cisco IP Phone to the network. 
3.
Connect the external power supply to the phone after the phone powers up.

Understanding Interactions with Other 
Cisco IP Telephony Products
To function in the IP telephony network, the Cisco IP Phone must be connected 
to a networking device, such as a Cisco Catalyst switch. You must also register 
the Cisco IP Phone with a Cisco CallManager system in order to send and receive 
calls.
This section covers the following topics: 
•
Understanding How the Cisco IP Phone Interacts with Cisco CallManager, 
page 2-2
•
Understanding How the Cisco IP Phone Interacts with the Cisco Catalyst 
Family of Switches, page 2-2
Understanding How the Cisco IP Phone Interacts with 
Cisco CallManager
Cisco CallManager is an open and industry-standard call processing system. 
Cisco CallManager software runs on a Windows 2000 server and sets up and tears 
down calls between phones, integrating traditional PBX functionality with the 
corporate IP network. Cisco CallManager manages the components of the IP 
telephony system—the phones, access gateways, and the resources necessary for 
such features as call conferencing and route planning. 
For information about configuring Cisco CallManager to work with the IP devices 
described in this chapter, refer to the Cisco CallManager Administration Guide 
and the Cisco CallManager System Guide.
Understanding How the Cisco IP Phone Interacts with the 
Cisco Catalyst Family of Switches
Cisco IP Phones have an internal Ethernet switch, enabling them to switch 
incoming traffic to the phone, the access port, or to the network port.

 
2-3
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Chapter 2      Preparing to Install the Cisco IP Phone on Your Network
Understanding the Phone Startup Process
If a computer is connected to the access port, data packets traveling to and from 
the computer, and to and from the phone, share the same physical link to the 
switch and the same port on the switch.
This shared physical link has the following implications for the VLAN 
configuration on the network:
•
The current VLANs might be configured on an IP subnet basis. However, 
additional IP addresses might not be available to assign the phone to the same 
subnet as other devices connected to the same port.
•
Data traffic present on the VLAN supporting phones might reduce the quality 
of voice-over-IP traffic.
You can resolve these issues by isolating the voice traffic onto a separate VLAN 
on each of the ports connected to a phone. The switch port configured for 
connecting a phone would have separate VLANs configured for carrying: 
•
Voice traffic to and from the IP phone (auxiliary VLAN)
•
Data traffic to and from the PC connected to the switch through the access 
port of the IP phone (native VLAN)
Isolating the phones on a separate, auxiliary VLAN increases the quality of the 
voice traffic and allows a large number of phones to be added to an existing 
network where there are not enough IP addresses. 
For more information, refer to the documentation included with the 
Cisco Catalyst switch.
Note
The Cisco IP Phone 7910 does not have an access port. If you require an access 
port on this phone model, use the Cisco IP Phone 7910+SW instead.
Understanding the Phone Startup Process
When connecting to the VoIP network, the Cisco IP Phone goes through a 
standard startup process comprised of seven steps. Each of these steps is fully 
described in the sections that follow:
•
Obtaining Power from the Switch, page 2-4
•
Loading the Stored Phone Image, page 2-4
•
Configuring VLAN, page 2-4

•
Accessing TFTP Server, page 2-5
•
Requesting the Configuration File, page 2-5
•
Contacting Cisco CallManager, page 2-5
Note
Some of these steps are optional, depending on the configuration of your 
specific network.
Obtaining Power from the Switch
You can connect the Cisco IP Phone to a Cisco Catalyst switch with one of the 
modules that provides power to the phone (WS-X6348-RJ45V 10/100 or 
WS-PWR-PANEL).
If you use this optional configuration, the phone receives phantom power and 
powers up when you connect the Cisco IP Phone to the switch. The phone then 
sends Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) notifications to the switch indicating it is 
ready to receive CDP packets and indicating the power requirement for the phone. 
The switch allocates power and sends it over the network cable.
Loading the Stored Phone Image
The Cisco IP Phone has non-volatile Flash memory in which it stores firmware 
images and user-defined preferences. At startup, the phone runs a bootstrap loader 
that loads a phone image stored in Flash memory. Using this image, the phone 
initializes its software and hardware.
Configuring VLAN
If the Cisco IP Phone is connected to a Cisco Catalyst switch, the switch next 
informs the phone of the voice VLAN defined on the switch. The phone needs to 
know its VLAN membership before it can proceed with the Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) request for an IP address.

 
2-5
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Chapter 2      Preparing to Install the Cisco IP Phone on Your Network
Understanding the Phone Startup Process
Obtaining an IP Address
If the Cisco IP Phone is using DHCP to obtain an IP address, the phone queries 
the DHCP server to obtain one.
Accessing TFTP Server
In addition to assigning an IP address, the DHCP server also directs the 
Cisco IP Phone to a TFTP Server. If the phone has a statically defined IP address, 
you must configure the TFTP server locally on the phone; the phone then goes to 
the TFTP server directly.
Requesting the Configuration File
The TFTP server has configuration files (.cnf file format) for telephony devices, 
which define parameters for connecting to Cisco CallManager.
If a phone has an XML-compatible load, it requests a .cnf.xml format 
configuration file; otherwise, it requests a .cnf file.
If you have enabled auto-registration in Cisco CallManager, the phones access a 
default configuration file (sepdefault.cnf.xml) from the TFTP server. If you have 
manually entered the phones into the Cisco CallManager database, the phone 
accesses a .cnf.xml file corresponding to its device name.
The .cnf.xml file also contains the information telling the phone which image load 
it should be running. If this image load differs from the one currently loaded on 
the phone, the phone contacts the TFTP server to request the new image file, 
which is stored as a .bin file.
Contacting Cisco CallManager
The configuration file defines how the Cisco IP Phone communicates with 
Cisco CallManager. After obtaining the file from the TFTP server, the phone next 
attempts to make a TCP connection to the highest priority Cisco CallManager on 
the list.

Understanding the Requirements for Installing and Setting Up the Cisco IP Phone
2-6
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
If the phone was manually added to the database, Cisco CallManager identifies 
the phone. If the phone was not manually added to the database and 
auto-registration is enabled in Cisco CallManager, the phone attempts to 
auto-register itself in the Cisco CallManager database.
Cisco CallManager informs devices using .cnf format configuration files of their 
load ID. Devices using .xml format configuration files receive the load ID in the 
configuration file.
Understanding the Requirements for Installing and 
Setting Up the Cisco IP Phone
To install and configure the Cisco IP Phone, you must configure some network 
settings, set up Cisco CallManager, and make changes locally on the phone.

Adding Phones to the Cisco CallManager Database
Before installing any Cisco IP phones, you must make decisions about how you 
want the phones to be added to the Cisco CallManager database. Because 
Cisco CallManager handles call processing in the network, this is a critical step. 
You can add phones to the Cisco CallManager database automatically using 
auto-registration, manually using the Cisco CallManager Administration 
application, or in groups with the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT).
Once you add a Cisco IP phone using the Cisco CallManager Administration 
application, the Phone Configuration Window in the application displays the 
device name, registration status, and the IP address of the Cisco CallManager to 
which the device is registered.
This section covers the following topics:
•
Using Auto-Registration, page 2-11
•
Adding Phones Manually, page 2-12
•
Using the Bulk Administration Tool, page 2-14

Adding Phones to the Cisco CallManager Database
Tip
To get help using the Cisco CallManager application, access context-sensitive 
help by choosing Help > For this screen from the main menu bar. For 
complete instructions and conceptual information, refer to the 
Cisco CallManager Administration Guide and the Cisco CallManager System 
Guide.
Using Auto-Registration
Use auto-registration if you want Cisco CallManager to assign directory numbers 
automatically to new phones as they connect to the IP telephony network. Once a 
phone has auto-registered, you can move it to a new location and assign it to a 
different device pool without affecting its directory number.
With auto-registration enabled, Cisco CallManager begins the automatic startup 
process to obtain a directory number as soon as you connect the Cisco IP Phone 
to the network. During auto-registration, Cisco CallManager automatically 
assigns the next available sequential directory number to the phone.
Use auto-registration to quickly get all phones into the Cisco CallManager 
database. You can then modify any settings, such as the directory numbers, from 
Cisco CallManager. If you do not use auto-registration, you must manually add 
phones to the Cisco CallManager database or use the Bulk Administration Tool 
(BAT). 
Use the following procedure as a starting point to enable auto-registration using 
the Cisco CallManager Administration application.
Procedure
Step 1
Log in to the CallManager Administration application. 
Step 2
From the menu bar, choose System > Cisco CallManager.
The Cisco CallManager Configuration window appears.
Step 3
Verify that the “Auto-registration disabled on this Cisco CallManager” setting is 
not checked. Cisco CallManager disables the auto-registration by default to 
prevent unauthorized connections to the network.
Step 4
To modify phone settings, choose Device > Phone. Use the Find and List Phones 
window to enter search criteria for each phone.

Step 5
Install the phone by following the instructions in Chapter 3, “Installing the 
Cisco IP Phone.”
For additional information, access context-sensitive help from the application or 
refer to Cisco CallManager documentation.
Adding Phones Manually
If you want to assign specific directory numbers to a specific Cisco IP Phone 
without using auto-registration, you can manually add each phone to the 
Cisco CallManager database or use the Bulk Administration Tool (BAT).
If you want to add phones manually, and are not using Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) in your network, then you must configure the IP 
settings and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server locally on each phone.
Alternatively, if you use DHCP, but want to manually set the TFTP server, then 
allow the phone to start up, using DHCP, before re-assigning the TFTP server.
Refer to these topics for more information:
•
Adding Phones Manually Using DHCP, page 2-12
•
Assigning Static IP Addresses, page 2-13
Adding Phones Manually Using DHCP
If you are using DHCP in your network, but you are not using auto-registration, 
you can manually add a phone to the Cisco CallManager database. If you are 
using DHCP, you do not need to assign IP addresses or TFTP servers. 
Use the following procedure as a starting point to add phones manually using the 
Cisco CallManager Administration application.

Assigning an IP Address
The IP address is the unique logical address identifying each host computer, or 
node, on a TCP/IP network. An IP address is a 32-bit number expressed as four 
decimal numbers from 0 to 255 separated by periods. 
Each IP address has two parts: the network ID and the host ID. The network ID 
identifies all hosts that are on the same physical network. The host ID identifies a 
specific host on a network.

Assigning DNS Servers
The DNS setting on the Cisco IP Phone allows users to specify remote computers 
by host names, which are character strings with some mnemonic value, rather than 
by using IP addresses, which are simply strings of numbers. 
The phones use DNS to resolve the host name of TFTP servers, 
Cisco CallManager systems, and web server host names when the system is 
configured to use names rather than IP addresses.

Configuring Ports
The PC and switch (SW) port configuration settings determine the speed and 
duplex of the PC and network ports, respectively.
If you change the port configuration setting value for either the PC port or the SW 
port, you must change the other to match or configure both to auto-negotiate.
If the phone is connected to a switch, you must configure the switch's port to the 
same speed/duplex as the phone, or configure both to auto-negotiate. 
The values for both are: A (auto-negotiate), 10H (10BaseT/Half Duplex), 10F 
(10BaseT/Full Duplex), 100H (100BaseT/Half Duplex), or 100F (100BaseT/Full 
Duplex). This setting is not case sensitive.

78-10453-03
To set up these features, open the Cisco CallManager Administration application 
and select User >Add a New User. Refer to the Cisco CallManager 
Administration Guide, the Cisco CallManager System Guide, or context-sensitive 
help in the application for details.
After you add users to Cisco CallManager, provide users with the URL to access 
the Cisco IP Phone User Options application. From this web-based application, 
users can configure speed dial and call-forwarding numbers and choose the 
services to display on their phones.
Modifying Phone Button Templates
Although the Cisco IP Phones support similar features, each phone model can 
implement these features differently. Modify phone button templates to assign 
features to phone buttons and to customize features for a phone model.
Ideally, you can modify templates before registering phones on the network. 
Proceeding in this order allows you to access customized phone button template 
options from the Cisco CallManager Administration application during 
registration.
To modify a phone button template, open the Cisco CallManager Administration 
application and select Device > Phone Button Template. Refer to the 
Cisco CallManager Administration Guide, the Cisco CallManager System Guide, 
or context-sensitive help in the application for details.

•
speed 1 and speed 2—for speed dialing
•
redial—for dialing the most recently dialed number again
If you change these button assignments, you can also update their corresponding 
labels on the Cisco IP Phone 7910. The Cisco IP Phone 7910 shipped with extra 
mylar labels on a perforated sheet. After printing the labels, you can easily remove 
them from this sheet. 
These label sheets have different textures—one smooth side and one textured 
side; the textured side is labeled “front.” This is the side that users contact when 
pressing the buttons. The type of printing method used determines the side to print 
on. To avoid ink rubbing off on users’ fingers, choose a printing method that prints 
on the smooth side of the labels.
Use these specifications to print on the labels:
•
Text size—10 point (on a PC-compatible computer) or 12 point (on a 
Macintosh-compatible computer)
•
Text font—Univers 65 bold oblique
•
Text color—PMS 413C
•
Text position—2.533 mm above the button hole openings
Configuring Corporate Directories
Cisco IP Phone models 7960 and 7940 can store a directory of employee names 
and phone numbers. Although you access the directory from the IP Phone, you 
must configure the directory before users can access it. To use the corporate 
directory, you must have users entered into a Lightweight Directory Access 
Protocol (LDAP) directory configured with Cisco CallManager.
To set up these features, open Cisco CallManager and select User > Global 
Directory. Refer to the Cisco CallManager Administration Guide, the 
Cisco CallManager System Guide, or context-sensitive help in the

Setting Up User Services
Setting Up User Services
The Cisco IP Phone models 7960 and 7940 allow users to access specific 
information services, such as local movie times, stock quotes, weather reports, 
and so on. Although users access these services by pressing the Services button to 
display a services menu on the Cisco IP Phone, you must first configure the 
services to which users can subscribe.
In summary: 
•
System administrators configure available services using the 
Cisco CallManager Administration application.
•
Users subscribe to services using the Cisco IP Phone User Options 
application. This web-based application provides a graphic user interface 
(GUI) for limited, end-user configuration of IP Phone applications.
Before setting up services, gather the URL addresses for the sites you want to set 
up and verify that users can access those sites from your corporate IP telephony 
network. 
To set up these features, open the Cisco CallManager Administration application 
and select Feature > Cisco IP Phone Services. Refer to the Cisco CallManager 
Administration Guide, the Cisco CallManager System Guide, or context-sensitive 
help in the Cisco CallManager Administration application for details.
After you configure these services, verify that your users have access to the 
Cisco CallManager IP Phone Options web-based application, where they can 
select and subscribe to configured services. Refer to the Cisco CallManager 
Administration Guide, the Cisco CallManager System Guide, or context-sensitive 
help in the Cisco CallManager Administration application for details.
Note

Table 7-2 describes restrictions or other known troubleshooting suggestions 
for the Cisco IP Phone 7914 Expansion Module.
Table 7-1
Cisco IP Phone Troubleshooting
Summary
Explanation
Message waiting light does not work 
with non-Cisco voice mail systems
The message waiting light does not light if you are using a 
non-Cisco voice mail system, and Cisco CallManager is not 
configured correctly for that voice mail system. In this case, the 
user must access the voice mail system to determine if he or she 
has received new messages.
Messages button does not work with 
non-Cisco voice mail systems
If you are using a Cisco voice mail system, the messages button 
retrieves the messages. For non-Cisco voice mail systems, you 
must access the voice mail system to retrieve messages.
Daisy-chaining IP phones
Do not connect an IP phone to another IP phone through the 
access port. Each IP phone should directly connect to a switch 
port. If you connect IP phones together in a line 
(daisy-chaining), a problem with one phone can affect all 
subsequent phones in the line. Also, all phones on the line share 
bandwidth.

 
Chapter 7      Troubleshooting
7-2
Cisco IP Phone Administration Guide for Cisco CallManager
78-10453-03
Poor quality when calling digital cell 
phones using the G.729 protocol
In Cisco CallManager, you can configure the network to use the 
G.729 protocol (the default is G.711). When using G.729, calls 
between an IP phone and a digital cellular phone will have poor 
voice quality. Use G.729 only when absolutely necessary.
Prolonged broadcast storms cause IP 
phones to re-register
Prolonged broadcast storms (lasting several minutes) on the 
voice VLAN cause the IP phones to re-register with another 
Cisco CallManager server.
Moving a network connection from 
the phone to a workstation
If you are powering your phone through the network 
connection, you must be careful if you decide to unplug the 
phone’s network connection and plug the cable into a desktop 
computer. The computer’s network card cannot receive power 
through the network connection; if power comes through the 
connection, the network card can be destroyed. To prevent this, 
wait 10 seconds or longer after unplugging the cable from the 
phone. This gives the switch enough time to recognize that 
there is no longer a phone on the line, and to stop providing 
power to the cable.
Changing the telephone 
configuration
To change the telephone configuration, you must press **# and 
then the Settings button.
Phone resetting
The phone resets when it loses contact with the 
Cisco CallManager software. This lost connection can be due to 
any network connectivity disruption, including cable breaks, 
switch outages, and switch reboots.
LCD display issues
You might see Beat frequencies (scan lines) in the LCD if you 
are using certain types of old fluorescent lights in your 
building. Moving the phone away from the lights, or replacing 
the lights, should resolve the problem.
Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) 
delay
When you are on a call that requires keypad input, if you press 
the keys too quickly, some of them might not be recognized.

LAN-utganger inneholder SELV-kretser og WAN-utganger 
inneholder TNV-kretser. Det finnes både LAN-utganger og 
WAN-utganger som bruker RJ-45-kontakter. Vær forsiktig når du 
kobler kabler.
Aviso
Para evitar choques eléctricos, não conecte os circuitos de 
segurança de baixa tensão (SELV) aos circuitos de tensão de 
rede telefónica (TNV). As portas LAN contêm circuitos SELV e as 
portas WAN contêm circuitos TNV. Algumas portas LAN e WAN 
usam conectores RJ-45. Tenha o devido cuidado ao conectar os 
cabos.

¡Advertencia!
Para evitar la sacudida eléctrica, no conectar circuitos de 
seguridad de voltaje muy bajo (safety extra-low voltage = SELV) 
con circuitos de voltaje de red telefónica (telephone network 
voltage = TNV). Los puertos de redes de área local (local area 
network = LAN) contienen circuitos SELV, y los puertos de redes 
de área extendida (wide area network = WAN) contienen 
circuitos TNV. En algunos casos, tanto los puertos LAN como los 
WAN usan conectores RJ-45. Proceda con precaución al 
conectar los cables.
Varning!
För att undvika elektriska stötar, koppla inte säkerhetskretsar 
med extra låg spänning (SELV-kretsar) till kretsar med 
telefonnätspänning (TNV-kretsar). LAN-portar innehåller 
SELV-kretsar och WAN-portar innehåller TNV-kretsar. Vissa 
LAN- och WAN-portar är försedda med RJ-45-kontakter. Iaktta 
försiktighet vid anslutning av kablar.
