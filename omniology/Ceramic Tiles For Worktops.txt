CERAMIC TILES FOR 
WORKTOPS & FLOORS  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
If you have some experience of cutting and fixing wall tiles 
then this will prove invaluable when moving on to the much 
tougher tiles used for floors and worktops. 
  
 
 
Wear eye protection when using a tile cutter. Take care with 
sharp edges. Avoid prolonged skin contact with adhesive and
grout. 
  
 
 
Ceramic and quarry floor tiles provide a hardwearing and 
attractive surface for kitchens, bathrooms, hallways and 
conservatories. 
  
Ceramic tiles can be laid on concrete or suitably prepared 
wooden floors and worktops. Be careful when setting them 
out because a lot of cutting work can be saved at this stage. 
The other important point is to get the whole surface flat 
and level so the edges of the tiles don't stick up. On uneven 
handmade or terracotta tiles, a few protruding edges are 
inevitable but you still need to be careful about how you lay 
them. There is an art in laying uneven tiles because it's 
impossible to lay a spirit level over several handmade tiles - 
you need to use your eye and judgement. 
 
2  - Worktops 
Tiled worktops are durable enough to withstand hot pans 
and will resist staining and abrasion provided that flooring 
grade tiles are selected.  
 
 
 
The drawback of tiles is that the grout lines between the 
tiles can harbour dirt. It is therefore essential that the grout 
is durable.  
 
 
 
Two part epoxy grout is used in commercial situations where 
food is prepared because it doesn't stain and it won't 
harbour bacteria easily. The problem is that this type of 
grout has to be mixed and applied very quickly because the 
setting time is only around half an hour; once it is set the 
only way to remove it is by sanding.  
 
 
 
For a domestic kitchen, where the food is prepared on 
chopping boards and not directly on the tiles, you might find 
it easier to use an acrylic grout. This is more durable and 
resistant to staining than powder based wall tile grouts, but 
it won't last as long as epoxy grout. However, when the time
comes to replace it, you can just rake out the top 2mm of 
grout and place more acrylic grout over the top.  

 
 
 
3  - Preparing concrete floors 
Although some tiles, such as quarry tiles, will hold back a 
great deal of damp, it is not advisable to use tiles as a cure 
for damp floors.  
 
 
 
You can test for damp by 
placing upturned jam jars on 
doughnut rings of putty. 
Leave them overnight and if 
in the morning there is 
moisture on the inside of the 
jars, the floor is damp (1).  
 
If there is rising damp in the 
floor, it should be treated 
first. You can use a paint-on 
solution such as water-based 
bitumen emulsion. Apply two 
coats and lightly sprinkle sharp sand on the top coat to give 
a good key for the tile adhesive.  
 
 
 
In most cases, the adhesive used to stick down floor tiles 
can be laid in a thick bed which will allow for slight 
discrepancies in the floor surface. If the floor is uneven, it is 
better to float a screed over the floor. This can be done with 
a self-levelling screed which is mixed with water in a bucket, 
poured over the floor and spread with a trowel. 
Alternatively, for a thicker screed, you can mix up three 
parts sharp grit sand and one of cement with three parts 
water to one of PVA. This can be trowled into the low areas 
and feathered out at the edges.  
 
 
 
Where a floor crosses from wood to concrete, as in a kitchen 
extension, it is almost certain to crack along the division if it 
is tiled over. To avoid this, you need either a flexible silicone 
joint at this point, or sheets of 1/2in plywood laid over the 
wood and concrete as an interlayer. The plywood can be 
stuck onto the concrete with panel adhesive.  
 
 
 
 
4  - Preparing wood 
If you are tiling over floorboards, it is essential to lay down 
some 1/2 inch plywood first to provide a stable inter-layer. 
It should be fixed with screws or ring-shanked nails which 
won't pull out.  
 
5  - Priming 
If you intend to use a cement-based tile adhesive, it is best 
to prime porous concrete surfaces and plywood first with 
some diluted PVA adhesive. This will prevent the moisture 
being drawn out of the adhesive before it has a chance to 

set properly. 
 
6  - Setting out 
Very few rooms are perfectly 
square. You need to see w
differences there are in the 
dimensions and work out how 
to deal with them. Starti
from a line centred on a 
doorway or the middle of the
room, try laying a row of tiles 
on the floor in a dummy 
so you can see where the cu
tiles will occur. If you end up 
with tiny slivers move th
middle row one way or the 
other so the cut tile is more substantial (2). For example, 
you can set the first row to straddle the centre line or to go 
either side of it.

To make sure the first row of 
tiles is perfectly straight, it is 
best to snap a line down the 
middle of the room with a 
piece of chalked string. Lay 
the string on pencil marks at 
either end and pull it tight 
then lift is slightly and let it 
ping onto the floor. This 
should leave a straight chalk 
line across the room (3). 
 
7  - Laying the tiles 
Start furthest away from the door and work backwards so 
you complete the part nearest the door last. You must leave 
the tiles for 24 hours before walking on them. If you can't do
this, lay some boards down on top of the tiles and tread 
gently.  
 
 
 
You can start laying from the middle of the room towards 
the edges but complete a whole row each time, apart from 
the cut tiles at the edges which can be done later. 
Alternatively, for a larger area, temporarily fix two guide 
battens at right angles, set out from the line of the first row 
of whole tiles.

complete a square of tiles 
and then use the notched 
edge to comb through the 
adhesive to make ridges with 
a uniform height. Place the 
tiles on top of the adhesive 
and press down. Check each 
tile is level and in line with 
the adjacent tile (4). Place a 
spacer next to the tile and 
then continue with the next 
one.

8  - Spacers 
Use spacers between tiles to 
establish grout lines. If the 
tiles are exactly the same 
size you can use tile-spacer 
crosses which you leave in 
place and grout over (5). If 
the tiles vary slightly in size 
you are better off using pegs 
or small pieces of timber 
which you can pull out when 
the adhesive dries. You may 
have to use your judgement 
in keeping the lines roughly 
equal if the tiles vary greatly 
in size.  
 
 
 
On very large floor areas, you should incorporate a flexible 
silicone joint to allow for expansion. This is best done in line 
with a room opening or division so it appears as a natural 
division.  
 
Wipe off all traces of adhesive from the tile faces as you go 
and rake out between the tiles before the adhesive sets.  
 
 
 
9  - Mosaic tiles 
In small areas such as 
bathrooms with lots of 
obstructions on the floor or 
worktops it's best to avoid 
large tiles - there will be so 
few whole tiles that the e
will be lost. Mosaic tiles are 
ideal in these situations
they are easily cut to fit 
round obstacles (6). The tiles 
are joined by a nylon mes
a paper face which keeps 
them perfectly spaced. If 
your tiles have a mesh this is
simply bedded in the 
adhesive whereas paper-faced tiles are laid with the paper 
uppermost. This should be removed when the adhesiv

the tiles are glazed, you can spread the grout all over the

This will compact the grout to make it water resistant.

chipboard or plywood less than 25mm (1in) thick.
