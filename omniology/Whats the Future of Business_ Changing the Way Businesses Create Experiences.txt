BUSINESS . . . MEET DESIGN
[ BUSINESS . . . MEET DESIGN ]
As you’ll soon see, this book blends the worlds of business and design to deliver intentional experiences. You’re 
going to notice something as you turn the pages. There’s a reason the cover is what it is. The shape? That too 
was not by chance. What’s the Future of Business? is a visual representation of a simple but powerful formula: 
business + design = intended experiences. 
The book is organized by a traditional table of contents. But, you’ll notice a virtual slider on the side of each 
chapter that visualizes a story arc to help you navigate each important theme as you go. 
To help me deliver this experience required the assistance of some friends. First, the team at Mekanism, 
an award winning creative agency that I’ve had the pleasure of disrupting markets with over the years, is 
responsible for bringing the book to life. Next, my dear friend Hugh MacLeod (@gapingvoid) and his team at 
Social Object Factory transformed the thrust of each chapter into a piece of original art. 
Thank you Mekanism.

Happiness is not 
something you 
experience, it’s 
something you 
remember.
—Oscar Levant

How do we ensure that our customers have an amazing customer experience? An intriguing 
question.
In the 1990 movie Total Recall, Douglas Quaid’s character visits “Rekall,” a company that helps 
people have experiences they wish they could have by implanting memories. For his vacation 
Quaid selects his dream experience, a trip to Mars with an added espionage package.
During his experience, Quaid is jolted awake carrying the experience back into the real world. 
It is later discovered that he really is the character he was hoping to become temporarily. Like 
Quaid, every customer desires a remarkable experience. 
Why make customers cope with the ordinary?
Total Recall echoes the focus of this book and my day-to-day work. While implanting desirable 
experiences is not necessarily a metaphor for this book, creating real-world “customer 
experiences” is a critical role businesses must create in a new era of consumerism.
The Total Recall moment is waking consumers up to expect more from the businesses they 
support and the products they purchase. They not only expect better experiences, they 
believe they are entitled to them. This is an opportunity for your business to create positive 
experiences. For it is the experience that will become that measure of satisfaction and success.

CHAPTER 0
THE VOICE OF THE 
EMPOWERED CUSTOMER
Through technology, consumers are experiencing a validating and inﬂ uential form of 
empowerment.
Businesses must recognize that the voice of the customer is now more powerful than ever 
before. Whether Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yelp, review sites, product forums, blogs, or 
Pinterest, your customers are sharing their experiences on platforms where audiences can ﬁ nd 
what others are saying about you.
So what?
Your customers and prospects will inevitably ﬁ nd the negative experiences others have had. 
Customers will uncover the one horrendous review rather than the incredible experiences that 
others have had.
As customers tweet negative experiences, businesses try to respond or address the complaint. 
The more a company engages, and the more people gain access to social and mobile platforms, 
interactions accelerate and amplify. Knowing this, companies are spending more money and 
resources managing their online reputations. Increasingly, businesses are shifting resources until 
the traditional call center is replicated at social scale. Although that’s inherently a good thing, 
the downside is that the call center becomes a notable cost center.
Perhaps this is just the new cost of doing business. In an era of connected consumerism, to earn 
customer attention, trust, and loyalty is a cost and an investment in relevance and relationships.
[ 
]

Yet even with the pervasiveness of technology, and increased customer expectations, businesses 
are making the same mistakes. We are not designing and implementing incredible experiences; 
rather, we’re marketing, selling, and serving customers. 
What are customers to align with if we 
don’t ﬁ rst deﬁ ne it? What do we want them 
to be a part of?
Now’s the time for an investment in something more than price, performance, or value. The 
future of business is about creating experiences, products, programs, and processes that evoke 
splendor and rekindle meaningful and sincere interaction and growth.
At the center of this evolution—or (r)evolution—is the experience. And, the experience is 
everything now.

CHAPTER 0
ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?
Yes, it’s time to invest in proactive experiences. If we do not, we will be forever tethered to the 
unproductive dance that is reacting, responding to, and solving negative experiences in real 
time, over time.
What if I told you that the cost of reacting to experiences is far greater than the cost of 
proactively deﬁ ning experiences from the onset? Indeed, companies are investing in reactive 
engagement. And, for the most part, they can succeed in shifting negative experiences toward 
positive territory. However, any favorable outcome is weighed against the cost of the initial 
negative experience—or more importantly, the cost of how that negative experience was shared 
and how it ultimately impacted others. What’s most startling is that businesses do not measure 
these numbers today. But that’s about to change.
Businesses must invest in deﬁ ning not only a positive experience, but also a wonderfully 
shareable experience. Doing so inﬂ uences others to join the fray while offsetting negative 
inquiries and the damaging viral effects of shared negative experiences.
This is the time to reframe those negative experiences. Pushing a change from responding to 
negative experiences to proactively creating positive ones is everything. Why? The cost of 
reacting to negative experiences is completely eclipsed by the upside of creating and nurturing 
positive experiences at the inception.
To better understand the importance of experience requires that you ﬁ rst acknowledge that you 
are the very consumer you’re trying to reach. You’re not looking for just any experience, you’re 
[ 
]

looking for the experience. Businesses that recognize and adapt to you and people like you will 
quickly learn how to entice you through shared values and meaningful afﬁ nity hooks . . . while 
never stopping to compete for relevance.
Experience is everything. And, businesses must create experiences that mean something. If 
necessity is the mother of invention, then vision is the father of innovation.

How to Survive Digital Darwinism

People never learn 
anything by being 
told, they have to 
ﬁ nd out for 
themselves. 
—Paulo Coelho, 
Veronika Decides to Die

The customer journey is still evolving. How businesses react and ultimately lead the 
enhancement of relationships is not solely determined by technology.1 To truly get closer to 
customers takes a culture of customer-centricity, empowerment, and innovation.
Saying that we need to get closer to the customer is hardly enough to convince business 
leaders that the customer revolution they hear about is literally steps away from their ofﬁ ce 
door. I know I’m not saying anything here you don’t already know. The difference is, however, 
that what started as a groundswell for business transformation from the bottom up has hit a 
ceiling. To break through it requires that someone (read: you) has to make the case to bring 
change from the top down.
Most executives don’t use social networks or smart phones. Many don’t even read their own 
email. Many won’t ever read this book. So, trying to convince decision makers that this is a war 
fought on the battleground of technology is in and of itself ﬁ ghting a losing battle.
SORRY, WE’RE CLOSED

CHAPTER 1
The future of business isn’t tied to the permeation of Facebook, Twitter, iPhones, and Droids, 
pins on Pinterest, tablets, or real-time geolocation check-ins. The future of business comes 
down to relevance and the ability to understand how technology affects decision making and 
behavior to the point where the recognition of new opportunities and the ability to strategically 
adapt to them becomes a competitive advantage.
But make no mistake: This is as much a technology revolution as it is a series of real-world 
revolutions that will eventually seize organizations, governments, and businesses. 
Change boils down to three things: 
1. Listening
2. Learning
3. Adapting

SORRY, WE’RE CLOSED 
15
DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY IS A 
CATALYST FOR CHANGE, NOT 
THE REASON
Look, I get it. Change is all anyone talks about today and we all know that talk is cheap. 
We also know that change is inevitable and that it is rarely easy. Among the greatest difﬁ culties 
associated with change is the ability to recognize that change is needed at a time when we 
can actually do something about it. All too often, by the time we realize that change is needed 
and that we must shift to a new way of thinking, it is already too late. Or worse, competitors 
recognize the need for change before us, and we are by default pushed into a position where 
our next steps are impulsive or reactive rather than strategic.
The volume of emerging technology is both awe-inspiring and overwhelming. As new 
technology makes its way into everyday life and work ﬂ ow, devices, applications, and networks, 
it disrupts the norm and begins to impact behavior. It is this disruptive technology that over 
time inﬂ uences how people work, communicate, share, and make decisions.
 The question is at what point does 
emerging technology or new behavior 
become disruptive? 
And, more importantly, what systems, processes, and protocols are in place that recognize 
disruption, assess opportunity, and facilitate the testing of new ideas?
The time to answer these questions is now.

CHAPTER 1
In my last book, The End of Business as Usual,2 I introduced the notion of Digital Darwinism, the 
evolution of consumer behavior when society and technology evolve faster than our ability to 
adapt. And the reality is that because of the role technology now plays in our lives, we forever 
compete for survival to effectively ﬁ ght off Digital Darwinism.
Humility is a gift and it’s needed in business now more than ever. Disruption not only faces every 
business, its effects are already spreading through customer markets and the channels that 
inﬂ uence decisions and behavior.
A recent advertisement produced by Babson College cited a rather humbling statistic:
Over 40 percent of the companies that were at the top of the Fortune 500 in 2000 were 
no longer there in 2010.
As we’re often painfully reminded, history has a way of repeating itself. Forbes published an 
article in early 2011 that served as a harbinger for the turbulent and transformative times that lie 
ahead.3 The opening line read,
The End is Near: Why 70% of the Fortune 1000 Will Be Replaced in a Few Years.
The author cited a study published in the book Built to Change by Edward E. Lawler and 
Christopher G. Worley. The study found that between 1973 and 1983, 35 percent of the 
top companies in the Fortune 1000 companies were new to the list. Over the next decade 
from 1983 to 1993, churn jumped to 45 percent, and then soared again to an astounding 
60 percent between 1993 and 2003. If the current trend continues, more than 70 percent of 
Fortune 1000 companies will turn over from 2003 to 2013. As the author observes, “In other 
words, over three-fourths of the existing captains of industry will fall from their throne.”

This is about the survival of both the ﬁ ttest and the ﬁ tting. It takes more than a presence in 
new channels to improve customer experiences and relationships. It takes courage. It takes 
persistence to break through resistance. But, in the end, it’s how you work with your leaders, or 
how you lead, to move toward an empowered and customer-centric culture that sets in motion 
real transformation.
You have a special path you must follow to set in motion the c hange that opens the door to 
improve experiences inside and outside the organization.

THE JOURNEY OF BUSINESS 
TRANSFORMATION

A mind that is 
stretched by a new 
experience can never 
go back to its old 
dimensions.
—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.

American mythologist, writer, and lecturer Joseph Campbell is lauded for his work in 
comparative mythology and comparative religion. In 1949, he published The Hero with a 
Thousand Faces1 where he traced the journey (rise, death, and rebirth) of the archetypal hero. 
His theory suggested that all historical myths from around the world, many surviving thousands 
of years, share a common story, stages, and outcomes.
Over the years, Campbell’s work has become known as the Hero’s Journey. The journey that lies 
ahead for you is in many ways similar to that of Campbell’s heroes: 
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural 
wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero 
comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his 
fellow man.
Campbell’s Hero’s Journey and its various interpretations have inspired everything from books 
and movies to video games . . . most notably the original Star Wars trilogy and the Matrix series. 
We can adapt this Hero’s Journey to the world of change and change management and the role 
you play in creating a culture of transformation and innovation in your business.
As someone who recognizes the need for change, you are about to embark on an epic journey. 
You will encounter challenges, but with hard work, perseverance, and the support of those 
around you, you can also experience the same decisive victory as Campbell’s heroes. 
The journey is laid out in multiple stages, with the ﬁ rst being that of discovery followed by 
intelligence, communication, and formulation. This book covers discovery and lays out a chart 
for your next steps.

CHAPTER 2

THE JOURNEY OF BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION 
23
The reward is business growth achieved through an enriched customer experience. The 
path to get there is not easy, but this is why it’s called the Hero’s Journey. Not everyone 
can lead the way.
Too often, the customer’s experience of a brand is an afterthought among many businesses. 
To bring the experience front and center will take nothing short of internal transformation. 
But, every journey to transformation must begin somewhere. Acknowledging that the world 
is changing is certainly a start. But how customers’ behavior is changing, how it’s impacting 
decision making, and how that decision making is affecting the business landscape is what 
must be documented, communicated, and shared within the organization. How your customer 
behavior is evolving is already impacting your bottom line and it’s becoming more profound 
every day.

24
CHAPTER 2
THE GREAT MYTH 
OF TECHNOLOGY
While everyone thinks they already know that technology is changing behavior, the reality 
is that assumptions and blind faith are still playing a role in how businesses are approaching 
these changes. Many experts believe that mobile and social networks are the new channels for 
engagement. They place their bets on the number of users each network boasts, as well as by 
the amount of attention press and bloggers pay to what’s hot. 
However, experts cannot tell you the role certain networks play in the customer’s decision-
making cycle, aka the customer journey. Nor can they pinpoint the economic impact of activity 
or conversations on the business before, during, and after the transaction. That is why the 
answer to the question of what the return on investment (ROI) of these initiatives is, is elusive to 
them. Instead they come up with new terminology to support their blind faith.
Technology is not the answer, it’s part of the answer. Many social media enthusiasts are 
convincing businesses, governments, and nonproﬁ ts to use social media based on this blind 
faith supported by soft metrics that for all intents and purposes is old marketing guised as 
newfound engagement. Just because a business is embracing new technology doesn’t mean 
that it is creating meaningful, productive, or measurable experiences. 
In many cases, my research shows that expansion into new networks is actually causing social 
blindness (the new media equivalent to banner or advertising blindness). It also causes brand 
dilution because the experience is the furthest thing from deﬁ ned, reinforced, or integrated. 
This happens because organizations are siloed. No surprise here. And, by nature, these silos 
contribute to the problem of disconnected or competing experiences. Businesses are often 
experimenting with new technologies independent of the overall business efforts. Meaning, 
[

25
THE JOURNEY OF BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION 
what one side of the company is saying and doing is different from the other. Therefore, the 
experience starts to work against the brand, or the brand promise. 
It’s not enough to know consumers are changing how they communicate, connect, discover, 
and, in turn, purchase. It’s not enough to adopt the technologies and networks they’re using. It’s 
not enough to even ﬁ ght for attention for these new networks. Your path begins with discovery 
and rethinking the new customer journey. 
This is the end of business as usual.
 But to get anywhere, you have to prove it. 
If you can collect and interpret the data and behaviors of your customers, they will lead to 
insights and the conﬁ dence necessary to convince the skeptics and the fearful. The truth is that 
the market votes with its dollars and those dollars are already being siphoned away from the 
inputs you have in place today. 
By entering the journey with the intention of discovery, you will learn where you’re losing dollars 
and the new places and supporting strategies where they can be earned and re-earned. Dollars 
are being increasingly earned and spent in new touch points. Discovery unlocks information. 
And information is empowering. Your work will demonstrate which side of the dollar you’re on 
now and how to be on the right side of revenue and relationships over the next several years.
The journey before you is great. The remainder of this book walks you through the dynamics 
of discovery to guide you to seek answers. But before we continue on this path, you must have 
a view of the overall picture. Let’s walk in the journey of our customers to deﬁ ne their journey. 
Doing so will give us perspective on where we need to focus when you’ve ﬁ nished reading.

We live in a time

are brands.

29
MEET THE NEW GENERATION OF CUSTOMERS . . . GENERATION C
With every day that passes, Generation Y, also known as the Millennials, become far more 
important to the economy than we can realize. Generation Y is considered to be those 
individuals born in the early 1980s to 2000s. They’re important because a gap exists between 
how Gen Y communicates and connects and how businesses, educators, and governments 
approach them, and it’s widening. In this era of Digital Darwinism, a time when society and 
technology are evolving faster than many organizations can adapt, we must realize that 
customer landscapes are not only changing, they’re evolving beyond our grasp today.
Do leaders realize that although they act like they’re talking to customers they already know, 
they are in fact talking to strangers?
Without understanding what matters to customers and why, without learning their behavior or 
decision-making cycles, and without empathy, we cannot create a meaningful and engaging 
customer experience. And, because this emerging class of connected consumers is so critical 
to the future of economics, this is a time when decision makers should stop looking at people 
through a lens of demographics and instead start designing experiences and outcomes based 
on interests and behavior. We cannot create experiences based on where they are to us nor can 
we expect them to use them.

CHAPTER 3
So, how well do you know Gen Y? 
Let’s ﬁ nd out . . . 
Here are some interesting data points that will help turn these would-be 
strangers into potential partners and customers:1
• Gen Y will form 75 percent of the work force by 2025 and are actively shaping corporate 
culture and expectations.2 Only 11 percent deﬁ ne having a lot of money as a deﬁ nition of 
success.
• Only 7 percent of Gen Y works for a Fortune 500 company as start-ups dominate the work 
force for this demographic. Gen Y’ers expect larger organizations to hear their voice and 
recognize their contributions . . . increasing the need for an “intrapreneurial” culture.
• Millennials watch TV with two or more electronic devices.3
• Millennials trust strangers over friends and family. They lean on user-generated experiences 
(UGE) for purchase decisions.
• They are three times as likely to follow a brand over a family member in social networks.
• Sixty-six percent will look up a store if they see a friend check in.
• Seventy-three percent have earned and used virtual currency.
• Gen Y’ers believe that other consumers care more about their opinions than companies 
do—that’s why they share their opinions online.
• Gen Y’ers are more connected on Facebook than average users, managing a social graph of 
696 Facebook friends versus the 140 maintained by everyday people.
• Twenty-nine percent ﬁ nd love through Facebook while 33 percent are dumped via TXT or 
Wall posts (SRS)—abbreviation for seriously.

MEET THE NEW GENERATION OF CUSTOMERS . . . GENERATION C
WIDENING THE VIEW FROM 
GENERATION Y TO 
GENERATION C
We often think about social media or mobile devices as the conduits to successful customer 
engagement. After all, that’s where attention is focused.
It takes more than technology to reach Generation Y. It takes understanding and empathy. 
That’s why these times are so signiﬁ cant: A growing number of your customers inﬂ uence and 
are inﬂ uenced in ways unfamiliar to us. How they communicate and connect, how they learn, 
discover, and share, how they make decisions, and how they take action are different from the 
generations before them.
So why wouldn’t a presence on any one of the most important social networks or mobile 
platforms clinch our future relevance in business?
The answer lies in how we view their worth in the customer ecosystem. We assume to extremes: 
These networks will either make us or they are completely irrelevant. The problem, though, is in 
our perspective. You are a small business owner. You are an executive or a manager within a small-
to-medium sized business. You are an executive with a global enterprise. You are an entrepreneur. 
You have a responsibility to not only your business, but your employees, vendors, and also your 
customers equally. To see them through one lens is, well, too clouded. But to see people for who 
they are and what deﬁ nes them, that’s where the future of business and relevance begins.
How is this different from the consumers whom you’ve known over the years? For starters, 
they’re connected. Yes, they’re on Facebook and Twitter. But, it’s more than that. Smart phones, 
tablets, ultraportable laptops, and whatever’s next . . . technology is becoming an extension of 
humanity. But it’s not the case for everyone and that’s part of the challenge. Having multiple 
consumer behaviors to cater to forces organizations to think differently about this group of 
connected consumers than the traditional consumers they’ve gotten to know over the years. 
However, we have to look beyond Millennials or the younger Generation Z that follows them.
[

32
CHAPTER 3
I refer to this new group of connected consumers as Generation C.4 It covers Gen Y, Generation 
Z, as well as anyone else among Generation X, Boomers, and Matures who’s crossed over to 
the digital lifestyle. This new consumer category that our businesses must serve is something 
altogether bigger than any demographic. This is the dawn of Generation C,5 where “C” represents 
a connected society based on interests and behavior. Gen C is not an age group—it is a way of life.
Gen C’ers are not bound by age; they’re not deﬁ ned by income, ethnicity, or education, 
either. These consumers do not surf the web like other customers. They live and breathe in 
social networks and use mobile devices as their windows to the world. They don’t learn or 
make decisions like their traditional counterparts. Gen C lives the digital lifestyle and unites 
demographics around interests and behavior.
Gen C’ers are different from any segment you’ve addressed in the past. What you think they 
want and what they truly value are worlds apart. Whether we get it or not, they’re always on and 
to reach them takes an altogether different approach. And, when you compare the size of the 
market for traditional consumers versus Generation C over the next few years, one of the two 
segments is growing while the other is shrinking.
If markets are shifting, think about how strategies are affected for a moment. Over time, but 
increasingly on a daily basis, greater emphasis will be placed on connected consumerism and 
the technology and channels they embrace over traditional marketing programs. As a result, 
new skill sets will be, and already are, required to engage Gen C. As a result, budgets are 
moving from traditional to new digital initiatives. So, which side of the dollar or investment 
do you want to be on? The side where budgets are dwindling or the side where demand and 
resulting budgets are growing?

33
MEET THE NEW GENERATION OF CUSTOMERS . . . GENERATION C
DIFFERENT TIMES CALL FOR 
DIFFERENT MEASURES
For some, Gen C is a small but not insigniﬁ cant share over your current opportunity. For 
others, Gen C’ers are a dominant source of inﬂ uence and revenue. What’s consistent is that 
they’re growing as a market segment. And, they rely on the shared experiences of like-minded 
strangers to guide their actions.
To Gen C, experience is everything. What they feel about your products and services now and 
over time is shared through these connected networks. They know that other Gen C’ers rely 
on their shared experiences to ﬁ nd resolution. If you’re not proactively designing the experience 
they have or deﬁ ning the journey that they will embark on, you cannot inﬂ uence the experience 
that’s shared about your brand.

34
CHAPTER 3
As you align your business objectives and strategies over the next year, 
start with the experience that you want your connected customer, and all 
customers for that matter, to embrace.
1 
Walk in their shoes.
2 
Learn how they connect and communicate.
3 
Discover how they discover.
4 
Uncover their preferences and expectations, and more importantly, what they value.
5 
Design marketing, service, engagement, and product strategies that add value.
6 
Lead the journey today and tomorrow.

35
MEET THE NEW GENERATION OF CUSTOMERS . . . GENERATION C
The chance that Gen C will ﬁ nd you through traditional channels grows fainter every day. But 
that’s not as ominous as it sounds. Opportunity is abundant.
The only thing that separates you from connected customers is your view of them, their 
awareness, and the channels that they rely on for engagement and fulﬁ llment. The rest is 
opportunity and the relentless pursuit of engaging, creating remarkable experiences, and 
delivering value. Now is the time to recognize how your customer landscape is shifting and to 
what extent traditional and connected consumers discover and make decisions differently.

THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY

In real life, the most 
practical advice for 
leaders is not to treat 
pawns like pawns, nor 
princes like princes, 
but all persons like 
persons.
—James MacGregor Burns

39
THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
Have you attended a concert where it seemed that everyone in the audience was holding up a 
phone to snap pictures or shoot videos? Or perhaps you noticed people looking down at their 
mobile devices, rather than focusing on the show. What’s the point, right? After all, going to an 
event is about being in the moment. It’s about enjoying the experience to the fullest.
Those individuals may seem distracted, but they are very much a part of the occasion. 
Multitasking is a way of life for them. But this isn’t just a love affair with smart phones and 
tablets. These “always on” audiences are sharing real-world experiences as they happen with 
their friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Socialcam. And their friends respond in 
real time, participating in the experience.
These Gen C’ers are deﬁ ning a new landscape for engagement. They’re becoming increasingly 
networked with everyday individuals amassing hundreds or even thousands of friends and 
followers in every network. What they say matters more than ever before as word of mouth 
evolves from one-to-one to one-to-many conversations. Shared experiences are a formidable 
currency in this network economy where an audience with an audience of its own continues to 
grow in inﬂ uence. And, it’s this inﬂ uence that is changing how consumers and organizations 
connect.
We are witnessing a “C” change (C for customer) in the balance of power between consumers 
and businesses: it’s transforming the face of engagement and redeﬁ ning the parameters of how 
businesses market and serve their consumers.

40
CHAPTER 4
Have you ever noticed that it’s mainly social media experts who address their problems with 
companies on Twitter? Why? It’s because they ﬁ gured out that by leaning on the reach and 
volume of their networks, they can get attention and make a difference. They also jump ahead of 
traditional service queues by making the infraction public. Businesses that respond do so to ﬁ rst 
limit the extent of negative sentiment, and some engage to truly change and improve perception.1
You’ve probably seen, or contributed to, tweets, blog posts, Facebook updates, or YouTube 
videos that share negative experiences about people, products, or companies. While some 
question the value of engaging customers in social networks, the simple truth is that social media 
didn’t unlock the ability to share experiences. Word of mouth has always been around, whether 
good or bad. Customers have taken to social networks so they can have a say in how other 
consumers view an organization. Additionally, customers are learning to take to these channels to 
voice their frustrations or to force companies to listen, respond to, and resolve problems directly.
At the center of this evolving customer landscape are shared experiences. People share 
everything. And whether we believe it or not, the activity around these shared experiences 
inﬂ uences the impressions and behaviors of other consumers in social networks. To what effect 
can be debated.2
Sites like Klout, Kred, and PeerIndex now measure social media activity and translate it into 
an “inﬂ uence score.” Unless users speciﬁ cally opt out, they are already indexed and ranked 
by these scores, which for better or for worse introduce a social consumer hierarchy. These 
measures of digital inﬂ uence are quite literally becoming a new standard for consumer 
marketing and service. And connected consumers know it.
[

A NEW ERA OF SOCIAL 
SERVICE: PROMOTING 
THE EXPERIENCES 
OF CUSTOMERS

41
THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
In each of these experiences, these tweets went seemingly unaddressed by the ofﬁ cial United Airlines 
Twitter presence @United—at least there was no public evidence to the contrary. These tweets were 
selected at random, but the potential reach of the three accounts combined at the time of the tweets 
exceeded 276,000 followers.

42
CHAPTER 4
United Airlines missed an opportunity to connect with Ryan Sarver, who alone had over 275,000 
followers at the time. The person he was corresponding with, @BT, who also tweeted a negative 
experience with United, had more than 420,000 followers at the time. In the social consumer 
hierarchy, these two very connected customers are certainly worthy of engagement. Combined, 
these two individuals eclipsed @United’s followers on Twitter by almost six times.
Alternatively, other airlines like Virgin America, JetBlue, and Southwest, as well as other 
businesses spanning almost every industry, use social networks as a way to engage 
dissatisﬁ ed customers. Doing so acknowledges that the voice of the customer is important 
and also often converts negative situations into positive outcomes. Customers often follow up 
complaints with praise.

43
THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
Individuals with the largest, most loyal, or actively engaged networks form a powerful consumer 
landscape. What they share contributes to a collective brand or service experience that without 
engagement is left for the connected audiences to deﬁ ne.
The connected consumer can become a formidable foe or ally for any organization. As such, 
the proactive investment in positive experiences now represents a modern and potentially 
inﬂ uential form of consumer marketing and service. But to engage in the new realm of digital 
inﬂ uence will take more than tweets or participating in social media conversations. Connected 
audiences demand that marketers and executives alike rethink the entire customer experience 
pre-, during, and posttransaction.
Many businesses also take a very important next step, which is to acknowledge happy customers. This 
form of positive reinforcement serves as a form of “unmarketing” where consumers feel appreciated and 
are encouraged to share all that they love about the business, product, and overall experience.

44
CHAPTER 4
THE BROKEN LINK OF 
SOCIAL MEDIA 
CUSTOMER SERVICE
  [ 
]
For all that disruptive technology is doing to change business for the better, it’s not yet enough. 
Ask executives what their priority business goals are for the next year and I’m sure you’ll see 
some element of customer-focus. The challenge that exists for any organization trying to get 
closer to customers lies in its customer-centricity.3 Sure, products and services count for almost 
everything. And yes, we’re learning about the importance of being proactive. But if a customer 
has a question, wishes to provide feedback, or needs help, this often results in buyers’ remorse 
or resentment.
In an effort to improve customer service and manage costs, companies began investing in 
automated solutions to improve the efﬁ ciency of customer engagement: sophisticated voice 
recognition systems to alleviate the hardship of pushing buttons to direct calls; improved call 
transferring that lessens the frequency of getting dropped; web forms, click-to-talk applets, and 
email ensure that the ﬁ rst round of automated replies you receive look more human than ever 
before. And, internal metrics are designed to incentivize representatives to reduce the amount 
of time it takes to get issues resolved. This eliminates the need to build comfort, conﬁ dence, 
and trust in each call. No, I’m not serious about this improving service. But this is the reality that 
a majority of human beings experience to pursue satisfaction or resolution.
Whereas the last mile of service is where a representative delivers a service to customers, 
the ﬁ rst mile is where experiences begin. The ﬁ rst mile of customer engagement is the 
postcommerce or posttransaction strategy that creates an ongoing experience to keep 
customers happy now and over time. Doing so sparks positive word of mouth and in turn 
inﬂ uences decisions in the dynamic customer journey that deﬁ nes the new era of connected 
consumerism.

45
THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
But, if getting closer to customers is a key 
objective, why do many businesses neglect 
the ﬁ rst mile of customer experiences?
When you look at how social media is utilized inside most organizations, you ﬁ nd that there’s 
a broken link between social media marketing and customer service. In fact, the majority of 
time, money, and resources are invested in marketing—not in supporting customers through 
engagement on social networks.
If a customer shares an experience or asks a question online, the ability for marketing to address 
it is certainly there. The trouble is that most of the time, the person or team managing social 
networks cannot effectively provide resolution or satisfaction. And there isn’t an internal process 
or technology platform that connects customers using social networks to customer service. This 
leads to a phenomenon that I call the Broken Link of Customer Engagement or the Social Arc 
Effect.4
If consumers have the power to act as either an extended sales force or as detractors, a change 
in priority is necessary.
Just because a company does not have a dedicated customer service person on social networks 
doesn’t mean that customers understand the difference. To consumers, a Facebook page or a 
Twitter handle is the brand. Customers do not see silos; they see one company. It’s up to the 
social media team to connect the dots instead of people tasked with managing social aspects of 
the business in a silo existing on its own.
Customer-centricity starts with recognizing that customer experiences are owned by the 
customer. As much as businesses attempt to integrate great experiences into product features 
and design, the ultimate experience unfolds at the point of engagement. In social media, 
because most activity is run out of the marketing department, when customers express 
discontent, praise, or simply require direction in the social networks of any brand, their outreach 
is initially received by the community manager or the representative agency/consultant.

46
CHAPTER 4
Depending on internal processes or the rules of engagement, chances are that customer 
sentiment and real-time needs will be overlooked, and as such, become the victim of a siloed 
enterprise.5 In reality, marketing doesn’t talk to customer service, or any other function for 
that matter, and customer service, without design, isn’t aggressive in stafﬁ ng up dedicated 
engagement across the social web.
A study conducted by Satmetrix in mid-2012 revealed that less than half of the companies it 
surveyed tracked and followed up on customer feedback in social media. An astonishing 
28 percent do not track or respond, leaving customers to question their value to the businesses 
that they support. That lack of acknowledgment or engagement leaves the door wide open to 
competitive courtship.

47
THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
CONNECTING THE DOTS 
IN SOCIAL MEDIA TO 
IMPROVE EXPERIENCES
Acquisition of customers through social networks is only part of the story. The brilliance of 
social networks is the opportunity to transform negative experiences into positive outcomes. 
Conversations inspire opportunities for product reﬁ nement or innovation to create remarkable 
experiences from the onset.
In 2007, I wrote a piece on how social media presented an opportunity to turn customer 
service into the “new” marketing, because retention is the new acquisition. For companies 
experimenting with social media, it’s time to break it out of the traditional call center and 
create a proactive group of expert agents. While social media is yet another channel for agents 
to engage customers such as chat, email, and phones, the reality is that it requires a different 
philosophy to effectively manage relationships and agent performance.
Time to resolution, cost per engagement, NPS, wait time . . . these are metrics of an aging era. 
Advocacy, referrals, positive endorsements, reviews, loyalty, these are the metrics that can be 
directly linked to social customer service among many other tangible outcomes, including return 
on investment (ROI).
The ﬁ rst mile of customer satisfaction, keeping you and me happy, must begin with reﬂ ection 
and introspection. To become customer-centric requires a change in how we value customers 
and the role they play in the decision-making cycles of those who make choices based on the 
shared experiences of others. The ﬁ rst mile is then paved through listening, governance, and 
engagement.
The Arc Effect is a visual representation of what is and what could be. Completing the arc 
should be a priority for businesses striving to be more customer-centric. To truly improve 
relationships and unlock advocacy requires that social media strategists work with customer

THE NEW CUSTOMER HIERARCHY
strategists to create an integrated series of processes and deﬁ ned roles and responsibilities. 
Doing so delivers a holistic experience that turns customers into stakeholders and stakeholders 
into protagonists of aspirational experiences. This is where your efforts should begin.
Answer this question: What is the experience 
you want customers to have?
In the end, no amount of responses can ﬁ x a broken product or service. Businesses must now 
proactively invest in the experiences they want customers to have and use new technology to 
measure the alignment of intended experiences versus shared experiences.
In the future, the new customer hierarchy will either work for you or against you. And if 
customers are going to talk about you, then give them something to talk about. Experiences are 
now the new “relationship.”

THE DIM LIGHT AT THE END 
OF THE FUNNEL

The only source 
of knowledge is 
experience. 
—Albert Einstein

Over the years, businesses have developed sales, marketing, and service strategies around the 
sales funnel.1 The model of awareness, interest, desire, and action describes the likely steps a 
customer may take in making a decision. If only the world were that simple.
It was assumed that the linear path of the funnel would continue despite the evolution of 
technology and behavior. But regardless, a journey as it migrates from consideration to 
evaluation to purchase to a state of loyalty and ultimately advocacy isn’t that simple to earn, 
unfortunately (or fortunately). The process of customer engagement requires dedicated 
monitoring, not just listening, to shepherd people along this delicate path. For at any 
moment, consumer attention, interest, and the resulting action could go astray without proper 
supervision or leadership.
This is why investing in creating the desired experience before, during, and after it’s 
experienced is so critical to the future of relationships and word of mouth. If people can’t 
connect with your intentions, then they can’t contribute to intended outcomes.
THE DIM LIGHT AT THE END OF THE FUNNEL

CHAPTER 5
FUNNEL VISION: WITHOUT 
AWARENESS THERE CAN 
BE NO CONSIDERATION
The customer journey goes beyond a simple sales funnel. Yet it is the funnel model that dictates 
how businesses invest in product development, sales, marketing, and service strategies.
Businesses today invest to varying degrees and effectiveness in marketing, advertising, and 
communications programs. However, customer attention isn’t a switch that toggles on and off—
it is a state of perpetual engagement. The blaring noise that customers continually experience 
has forced them to adapt. Second nature acts as a defense mechanism to tune out the constant 
barrage of marketing messages and clever campaigns. Awareness at the top of the funnel is 
elusive but the stakes have never been higher.
But what if businesses were investing their time and resources in the wrong places? What if 
where we think we can get customers to notice us is not at all where their attention is actually 
focused?
These questions will reveal a new journey to embark on. The truth is that what we know 
and what we need to know are separated by an unfolding reality that requires immediate 
intervention.
In a narrow, but honest, view businesses are designed to pull customers into the funnel. 
Strategists see people as targets and use marketing, not products or exceptional experiences, 
as bait. It’s assumed that customers make decisions that follow a series of linear and equally 
weighted steps to ﬁ nd and purchase your products and then later advocate to anyone and 
everyone on your behalf.
  [

THE DIM LIGHT AT THE END OF THE FUNNEL
55
THE CLUSTER FUNNEL
In reality, the funnel is less about AIDA (awareness, interest, decision, and 
action—we’ll also add loyalty to give businesses the beneﬁ t of the doubt). 
Instead it is a superﬁ cially designed production with six distinct acts: 
1 
The Persuasion: Convince the prospects that they need your product without 
considering their need, experience, or the reward. This is done through clever marketing 
and advertising. Contests and campaigns also raise awareness to create need or the 
perception of it.
2 
The Hook: Emphasize the reasons to buy in the moment rather than the long-term 
relationship or outcome. Packaging, price, rebate, gifts, and promotions are often the lure 
necessary to convert browsing into action.
3 
The Exchange: Convert the prospect into a customer. This is the moment someone 
ofﬁ cially becomes a stakeholder. There is an exchange beyond the payment for a product. 
Value must now be delivered on both sides of the relationship.
4 
The Distance: The distance here is that the space between the brand promise and the 
customer experience begins to spread. If a customer encounters anything negative, the 
distance is then measured by the steps it takes for a customer and business to connect 
and bring about resolution.
5 
The Reenchantment: Realizing that the customer experience is not completely 
understood, this stage is dedicated to ﬁ nding ways to keep customers interested and 
coming back. Strategies include discounts, promotions, exclusive offers, loyalty programs, 
and beta tests, among others.
[ 
]

56
CHAPTER 5
6 
The Governance: Once customers are enticed or in some cases ensnared, the relationship 
moves into a state of customer relationship management. You’re now forever known as a 
number with a record on ﬁ le. Conversations are now managed as tickets and placed within 
a queue for engagement and resolution. Your service level and attention level can be tied 
to your position within the customer hierarchy.
Revisiting Total Recall for a moment, the awakening customer 
has already altered the steps emphasized in the funnel. 
Technology introduces a sense of liberty that reminds each 
and every one of us that as strategists and decision makers, 
we have much to learn.
Your market has already been disrupted. Through an 
unforgiving series of technology revolutions in an era of 
individual empowerment, your customers are not only more 
informed, their expectations have grown. The “C” change in 
consumerism has ushered in a genre of connected consumers. 
As a result, your customers are learning about you and your 
competitors differently. How they make decisions does not 
follow a linear path. How they are inﬂ uenced and in turn 
inﬂ uence others is profound in its reach and effect.
The Cluster Funnel

57
THE DIM LIGHT AT THE END OF THE FUNNEL
What was once a simplistic representation of a ﬂ uted customer journey is in fact much more 
dynamic and connected. Learning how to uncover the moment of truth and shape experiences 
will set the stage for more meaningful outcomes and relationships.

THE ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH

Experience is not 
what happens to 
you. It is what you 
do with what 
happens to you.
—Aldous Huxley

61
THE ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH
When we talk about real time, we often think about rapid engagement and response. Doing so 
misses the splendor of what real time truly offers: the ability to listen, learn, and adapt. In many 
ways, though, we need to move faster than real time in order to get in front of it. Otherwise 
we’re forever locked into a rhythm of reacting rather than leading.
Welcome to the moment of truth . . . a series of four stages where customers take actions that 
move them toward or away from you.
You are competing in real time and at the right time. This “right” time is often referred to as the 
moment of truth. The MOT is that crucial moment when your customer decides at some point 
along the journey to select you or stay with you. In a real-time world, the “urgency of now” is 
that moment of truth that happens, well, right now.

62
CHAPTER 6
On August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. shared 
with us his dream, a dream that united people, hope, aspiration, and ambition to convey the 
urgency of now.1
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the ﬁ erce urgency of 
Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing 
drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
That’s what the urgency of now is all about, at least in business, anyway. 
In the moment of truth, how do you 
fare and what shared experiences are 
awaiting your customer? 
If it’s not deﬁ ned, then the urgency of now and the moment of truth will be your undoing. The thing 
about technology is that it connects us. It binds us together through actions, words, and shared 
experiences. The moments of truth are therefore paramount pre- and postpurchase. As people 
research, read reviews, tweets, and blog posts, ask and answer questions, watch videos, and simply 
learn from the experiences of others, these moments of truth require study and deﬁ nition.
As you begin to research the journey ahead, you realize the number of opportunities there 
are for continued engagement before, during, and after transactions. Without continuous 
engagement, decisions are either made for or against you in the moment. Understanding how 
to add value directly and indirectly shifts decisions in your favor. On top of that, it is the 
creation of incredible experiences that ensures you’re in, as the saying goes, the right place at 
the right time.
The moment of truth isn’t anything new in business. In September 2005, the Wall Street Journal2 
published a story on Procter and Gamble’s (P&G) controversial approach known as the First 
Moment of Truth (FMOT). FMOT refers to the incredibly short but crucial window of the three 
“
”

63
THE ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH
to seven seconds after a shopper ﬁ rst encounters a product on a store shelf. It is in these 
precious moments that P&G believes that marketers must focus efforts on converting shoppers 
into customers. To do so takes appealing to their senses, values, and emotions. It’s a lot to 
accomplish in just seconds, but it can be more impactful than the millions of dollars invested in 
mass advertising aimed at generating awareness and creating preference.
P&G didn’t stop there, however. The pioneering brand also looked at what it referred to as the 
Second Moment of Truth. This is, in my opinion, the future of everything as this second moment 
is deﬁ ned by the experience a customer has with a product. In Kevin Roberts’ book Lovemarks, 
P&G’s CEO A. G. Laﬂ ey explained the importance of these ﬁ rst and second touch points:
The best brands consistently win two moments of truth. The ﬁ rst moment occurs at the 
store shelf, when a consumer decides whether to buy one brand or another. The second 
occurs at home, when she uses the brand—and is delighted or isn’t.
In early 2012, Google published an exceptional ebook, ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of 
Truth,3 written by Jim Lecinski, which continued to explore new touch points or moments of truth. 
Google outlined a three-step model for marketing: stimulus, FMOT, and Second Moment of Truth 
(SMOT).
In the book, Google and Lecinski identify a critical step between the initial stimulus or the 
Cluster Funnel stage of “Persuasion” and the P&G’s FMOT or the Hook.
Whereas P&G’s FMOT focused on in-store, in-the-moment engagement, this ebook introduced 
the concept of the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT)—the few moments before people buy, where 
impressions are formed and the path to purchase begins. The idea isn’t new, but ZMOT can 
be adapted to the new world of technology and the networks where awareness and inﬂ uence 
unfold. ZMOT, as the ebook states, “is that moment when you grab your laptop, mobile 
phone, or some other wired device and start learning about a product or service (or potential 
boyfriend) you’re thinking about trying or buying.”
In other words, consumers will “Google it” (whatever is important for you to learn more about) 
and that’s where FMOT begins. In addition to Googling, they’re going to tweet, Facebook, 
YouTube, Pinterest, and so on, their search until they either get information or conversations 
about the product or service they are searching for.
“

CHAPTER 6
As the ebook points out, 79 percent of consumers say they use a smart phone to help with 
shopping. In addition, 70 percent of Americans look at product reviews before making a 
purchase. If 70 percent of consumers pick up a laptop, tablet, smart phone, or another connected 
device to learn more about your product or business after initial contact, what is it that they ﬁ nd?
The decision makers in your organizations might think that you’re doing everything you need 
to. After all, you have a website, right? You have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and 
Pinterest . . . FTW (for the win)! But to the person who’s connected not only digitally but socially, 
today’s online presences are just pages with a lot of marketing text or videos.
The dynamic customer is just that . . . dynamic. Static pages, commercials, or walls rich with 
trivial conversations and promotions are not going to guide consumers or B2B customers from 
ZMOT to FMOT. They need substance, personalization, and shared experiences to help guide 
them to the next step . . . to help them complete their journey.
Diving deeper into Google’s ZMOT, it expands the customer journey by connecting the 
Second Moment of Truth or “the experience” with among the most inﬂ uential of steps, 
the Ultimate Moment of Truth. The UMOT as I call it is the inﬂ uence loop that connects 
back to the Zero Moment of Truth for connected customers. It is these shared experiences 
that inﬂ uence impressions and decisions when someone searches or asks for information. 

65
THE ZERO MOMENT OF TRUTH
When someone searches, it’s often that the shared experiences of those who’ve already 
completed the journey will inﬂ uence the moments of truth for those seeking direction. While 
that may seem esoteric or perhaps commonsensical, the shared experiences of others can be 
designed. And for the most part, they aren’t today. No matter how brilliant your product design, 
the list of features, the number of apps you’ve introduced, or the creative genius behind your 
marketing, advertising, and social media campaigns, the ultimate moment of truth, what people 
will actually say about your product, is more aspirational in design than intentional. 
Shared experiences are the natural result or byproduct of product design. They either provide 
an exceptional, shareable experience or they don’t. Customers are either delighted or they’re 
not. If experiences aren’t engineered to contribute back to the Zero Moment of Truth, they are 
by default left to chance. Customers will then share whatever it is they encounter because that 
moment is left for them to deﬁ ne instead of you. And with the pervasiveness and accessibility 
of new media, that experience is going to be shared. As Jeff Bezos once famously said, “Your 
brand is what people say about you when you’re not in the room.” The bottom line is, it’s time 
to think about the experience we want people to have and share and then use new digital 
channels to steer each step along the journey to win in each moment of truth.

THE ULTIMATE MOMENT OF TRUTH
Did you know that consumers rely on 10 or more sources in making purchase decisions? 
Between 2010 and 2011 the average number of sources used not only doubled, but new 
technologies emerged to facilitate discovery and engagement around these sources.
Source: Google/Shopper Sciences. The Zero Moment of Truth 
Macro Study. April 2011. 
In ZMOT: Winning the Zero Moment of 
Truth,1 Google commissioned Shopper 
Sciences to study the sources of 5,000 
shoppers in 12 different categories and 
how they inﬂ uence decision making. The 
results are nothing less than staggering. 
When you compare your current 
marketing initiatives against the number 
of sources in the Zero Moment of Truth 
(ZMOT), it’s clear just how easy it is to 
miss monetizable opportunities.

CHAPTER 7
Even something as simple as researching quick-serve restaurants involves an average of 
5.8 sources. Shopping for a car? Well, that shoots up to an average of 18.2 sources. It’s not 
just B2C, though. People in every industry imaginable from B2B to politics to education are 
searching for information to help them make better decisions. Voters, on average, will touch 
14.7 sources before voting. For the record, that’s just below the 14.8 average number of sources 
that people said they use to shop for electronics.

In an increasingly social and mobile world, the ability to inﬂ uence decisions reaches beyond 
search, in-store, and traditional media. While traditional media’s inﬂ uence is trending downward, 
not surprisingly, mobile and social are trending upward. Yet, if you look at most marketing 
budgets today, company spending doesn’t match consumer behavior. Yes, money is invested 
in social media, mobile apps, search, online marketing, and so on, but investments in creating 
amazing experiences in each is disproportionate to the level of inﬂ uence these channels carry.

72
CHAPTER 7
Let’s take a look at apparel shoppers for a moment. Not only do consumers rely on multiple 
sources ofﬂ ine and online to make decisions, they use multiple devices to do so. PCs, tablets, 
and smart phones are real-time windows into a real-time world. And each window requires a 
dedicated and optimized design. Each design must contribute to a holistic experience across 
channels. The experience requires clear deﬁ nition and thought-out design.

Consumer dependence on social and mobile will only continue to rise as the inﬂ uence of 
traditional media wanes. The opportunities for you to engage consumers grow exponentially. 
But without study, experimentation, and investment, what might have been missed 
opportunities then become opportunity costs. Essentially, by not investing in creating 
experiences in these new channels of inﬂ uence, you are by default participating in Digital 
Darwinism, where technology and society are advancing faster than businesses can adapt.
We cannot appreciate the extent of our efforts to engage customers differently if we cannot 
appreciate the extent of the real opportunity before us.

CHAPTER 7
THE ULTIMATE MOMENT 
OF TRUTH
[

The Ultimate Moment of Truth (UMOT) represents the experience that people share after 
using your product and engaging with your company over time. Blog posts, YouTube videos, 
reviews, each in their own way direct people to take their next steps accordingly. When we talk 
about the idea of experience, it’s not only in reference to User Experience (UX) or Customer 
Experience, it’s also about Information Experience . . . what’s shared, what comes back, what 
people are sharing about those experiences. Like SEO (Search Engine Optimization), these 
moments can be predetermined and optimized.
Your website isn’t enough.
You might think that because you have a presence on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, YouTube, 
Pinterest, that you’re doing what you need to. But, you’re not. 
The future of inﬂ uence lies in experience. The experiences people have with your product, your 
company, your representatives, deﬁ ne the brand through the expressions they share.
Your work must focus on expressions, 
not impressions.
The connected consumer values information from friends, reviews, and shared experiences 
ahead of what you publish on your site. Therefore, as you think about strategy and the balance 
of channels and the overall marketing mix, add one additional element to the equation . . .

People are going to talk, so give them something to talk about. That’s the opportunity you 
have if you focus on creating experiences. Whether they’re good or bad, they’re shared. And 
we’re only at the beginning. Your connected customer is increasingly taking to networks and 
forums to voice their experiences. Knowing that these numbers are growing, especially in digital 
channels, what do you want them to experience? What do you want them to share? Someone 
must take responsibility for designing and deﬁ ning the experience.

OPENING A WINDOW INTO 
NEW CONSUMERISM

It is good to learn 
what to avoid 
by studying the 
misfortunes of 
others.
—Publilius Syrus

81
OPENING A WINDOW INTO NEW CONSUMERISM
Consumers are more informed than ever before. From the Zero Moment of Truth to the 
Ultimate Moment of Truth, consumers are taking control of their journey, discovering relevant 
information and making decisions their way in real time. To what extent are connected 
customers disrupting the current market and how fast will this grow over time? The answer is 
different for each business. But, the answer is there to uncover nonetheless. You just have to do 
the research. That’s where everything begins.
See, without analysis: 
• There can be no insights.
• Without insights, relevant and meaningful strategies are elusive.
• Without strategy, there can be no return on investment (ROI).1
Behavior of connected consumers is not only changing, it’s opening and closing traditional 
touch points, places, and ways to engage customers in real time and at the right time. And 
customer expectations have changed the locks to the doors that open new channels of 
engagement. To unlock them takes more than showing up and knocking. It certainly doesn’t 
take a locksmith or a battering ram either. It takes understanding, participating, and having a 
genuine intention to earn relevance. These technologies then become two-way channels for 
learning and engagement.
To create experiences requires ﬁ rst deﬁ ning what that experience will look like. Opening a 
window into new consumerism and taking in the splendor and magnitude of your customer 
landscape will also reveal the behavior and expressions that result from the experiences you 
create and those that are created for you. What we’re looking for here are the paths where 
experiences are shared and how they deﬁ ne or alter the direction of people in the moments 
of truth.

82
CHAPTER 8
DISCOVERY DISRUPTED
Consumers have access to valuable information that is available on demand whenever and 
wherever. Conversations with trusted sources can take place in real time. As a result, 
consumers have become enterprising and elusive. Relying on SEO, social media engagement, 
websites, advertising, in-store visibility, and every form of traditional marketing in play is no 
longer enough.
For the foreseeable future your business will be in a state of disruption. You may need to 
operate outside your comfort zones to reach a customer who is in fact divided into three distinct 
behavior types.

83
OPENING A WINDOW INTO NEW CONSUMERISM
OPENING THE DOOR TO A NEW 
GENERATION OF CONNECTED 
CONSUMERISM
While writing The End of Business as Usual, I uncovered three different sets of customer 
behavior patterns in the decision-making journey: traditional, digital, and connected. Although 
there is some crossover between traditional and digital and increasingly digital and connected, 
the latter is much more dynamic. Even though we’re focusing here on the connected customer, 
let’s review quickly the three groups to help give you a clear picture: 
1 
Traditional—Inﬂ uenced by traditional advertisements in print, online, and over the 
air/cable. Reliant on word of mouth among people they know and trust in the real 
world. Email and websites form the bridge between traditional and digital.
2 
Digital—Lives online, but enjoys traditional media as well. Decisions begin by searching 
Google. Information is collected by visiting websites and review communities. The bridge 
shared between digital and connected is represented by Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, 
and other popular social networks and mobile apps.
3 
Connected—This is Generation C . . . the connected. The most mobile of the bunch, 
connected customers live online through a portable device for the majority of the time. 
From smart phones to tablets to laptops, their smaller window into the world is much 
more real time and provides them with what could be argued as a much bigger picture. 
They scan bar codes in stores to compare prices and read reviews. Connected customers 
contribute actively to reviews on multiple sites and readily share experiences in social 
[

84
CHAPTER 8
networks. They blog and publish videos sharing every stage of experiences pre-, mid-, and 
posttransaction. QR codes (quick response codes) to them are often a disappointment, 
as once they’re scanned, they only lead to a website (that often won’t load well on a 
mobile device).
Connected consumers are empowered, informed, and demanding. They are comfortable 
sharing more than you realize and will share with you if they feel there’s value in return. If they 
Like you on Facebook or follow you on Twitter, they don’t expect editorial programming or 
entertainment as much as they do a sense of exclusivity, privilege, and access to special offers 
not available anywhere else. Gen C’ers are also driving social and mobile commerce. They 
shop socially, albeit virtually, and want to pay via mobile. That’s their window to the world. 
Here’s the key takeaway: They not only make decisions differently, they inﬂ uence and are 
inﬂ uenced differently. New touch points are springing up in each moment of truth every day. 
Your connected customers aren’t only becoming more demanding, but also discerning. Their 
expectations are permanently changing the way you engage them.

85
OPENING A WINDOW INTO NEW CONSUMERISM
Follow these four steps to connect with the connected customer: 
1. Listen
2. Learn
3. Engage
4. Adapt
Without understanding how your customers behave, you cannot legitimately design a desired 
experience. Without knowing their expectations, you cannot exceed them.
Knowing this, your next steps are to compare your customer activity, apply it to one of these 
three groups, and then assess how your current marketing, sales, and service strategies optimize 
the experiences for each. While we’re on the subject, do you know what the experience of your 
brand or business is for each group and do you know what it is about their experiences that 
they’re sharing?

86
CHAPTER 8
OPENING THE WINDOWS 
TO DIGITAL INFLUENCE
Understanding the connected consumer is the only way to develop meaningful marketing, 
sales, and service strategies. What’s more is that doing so also inspires a vision for what their 
experience could be and therefore requires you to formulate what you want that experience 
to be. Without this, the experience is left to the customer to determine and share. This creates 
chaos and confusion in the market.
What does your brand stand for—not just today, but also for the connected, discerning, and 
elusive customer of the future?
It’s time to get in front of transformation instead of reacting to it. The only way to do that is to 
realize that the customer you think you know and the customer you need to know are not the 
same person.
Let’s start with word of mouth. We know it’s important. We know that what people see, think, 
say, and share inﬂ uences the impressions and actions of others. But, do we know to what extent 
it impacts our business? Do we realize where and when this is happening today? And most 
important, do we know how to proactively increase this activity to desired results?
Capturing this information will help you prioritize channel strategies and stories. Additionally, 
it will surface opportunities to where and how to create value, address expectations, and steer 
activity to the beneﬁ t of your business and the customer experience.
Crowdtap, a company that helps businesses run inﬂ uence marketing initiatives, published a 
friendly infographic and accompanying report to visualize the impact of digital word of mouth.2 
I dissected the graphic to zero in on why you should learn more about how inﬂ uence can help 
your marketing, branding, and sales efforts.

Here, Crowdtap polled 1,000 people to share how they were inﬂ uenced to make a purchase 
in the past three months. Not surprisingly but certainly revealing, 92 percent claimed that they 
were inﬂ uenced by people they know. Have you ever posted or read a review of a product or 
business online? You’re not alone. Seventy percent stated that shared opinions online affected 
purchase decisions.
To break it down a bit more, Crowdtap looked at each medium to provide insight into what 
marketing efforts we may want to prioritize. Of the 1,000 surveyed, 70 percent were inﬂ uenced 
online. Second, at 61 percent, word of mouth was still a signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, but in a different 
form—either in person or by phone. Third, reading an article online inﬂ uenced 59 percent of 
consumer purchases. Think about the growing role blogs, reviews, and YouTube videos will play 
here.
Digital inﬂ uence is expanding beyond the boundaries of digital screens, impacting business 
decisions online and ofﬂ ine. The real-time web is moving faster each day. Your job is to help 
your business move faster than real time to deﬁ ne and lead experiences.
As you read this, decisions are made for or against you. In the next chapter, we examine 
the dynamic customer journey and the new touch points that are equally becoming 
consumer-powered platforms for shared experiences.

THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY

All experience is an 
arch to build upon.
—Henry Brooks Adams

93
THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Engagement is as much art as it is science. Understanding the behavior of your connected 
consumer takes practice of the social sciences—from digital anthropology and psychology to 
sociology and ethnography. Behavior exposes patterns in consumer activity with these new 
touch points and resources. Appreciating how customers form opinions and make decisions 
inspires empathy and creativity. This research can be summed up in the concept of the decision 
ellipse or what my colleagues and I at Altimeter Group refer to as the Dynamic Customer 
Journey.1
What you’ll learn from researching what consumers are doing online is, well . . . everything. 
Most notably, your business will now gain clarity in how and where to focus efforts in order to 
shape decisions and experiences pre-, during, and postcommerce. Said another way, you’ll 
gain insight into each moment of truth. Additionally, you’ll learn the speciﬁ c factors, people, 
technologies, communities, and resources that affect each stage of your customer’s journey. The 
results will contribute to a far more accurate point of view that tailors marketing, sales, service, 
and loyalty strategies to be more effective and engaging. But it won’t stop there.2

94
CHAPTER 9
Inspired by McKinsey’s work and my own research, I set out to reimagine the traditional sales 
funnel into a constant and very public elliptical path that often repeats itself.3 Not only is it 
constant, every shared experience and touch point inﬂ uences the decisions of all those who 
enter the decision ellipse. Experiences are now everything. For if you don’t deﬁ ne or shape 
experiences proactively, your brand is left for others to create in the Ultimate Moment of Truth.
On the surface, the stages of the DCJ reﬂ ect similar methodologies to the sales funnel, but the 
DCJ is designed to uniquely capture the path of your connected customer.
The AIDA funnel implies that customers move along a linear path from Attention to Interest to 
Decision to Action; and loyalty and advocacy are often assumed to be a by-product following 
each transaction. Research already shows that connected customers move into a state of 
neutrality, which can tilt toward negative or positive.

95
THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Each step is unique in the contributing factors for how consumers discover, 
analyze, choose, and share. Think about the moments of truth here and 
what people search for, say, share, experience, and what channels affect 
each of the following steps within the DCJ:
1. Awareness
2. Consideration
3. Evaluation
4. Purchase
5. Experience
6. Loyalty
7. Advocacy

96
CHAPTER 9
Whether through traditional or social search, asking questions within one’s social graph, or 
simply reading reviews, shared experiences, whether good or bad, affect the next steps of 
all connected customers that follow. The truth is that before customers can even think about 
becoming loyal or an advocate for your business, they must ﬁ rst experience the journey once 
again to validate their decision. If anything comes up different from the ﬁ rst, they may consider 
new alternatives. Either way, the entire journey is very social and very public. Customers are 
more connected and informed than ever before and it is the Ultimate Moment of Truth that 
deﬁ nes the journey for all connected customers who take passage.
Not only is the journey elliptical, at the center of the DCJ is the inﬂ uence loop—fed by the 
Ultimate Moments of Truth. Shared experiences are fed into the loop, forever indexed, and 
extracted during the moments of truth consumers experience.
The importance of the inﬂ uence loop cannot 
be overstated. It affects every stage of the 
journey, every moment of truth.
The screens your connected customers use to search and purchase, the people who inﬂ uence 
them, the content that informs them, the social networks they rely on, the collective experiences 
of others, and the real-time conversations that shape impressions, each introduce guidance, 
doubt, and validation that can work for you or against you. At every stage of the DCJ 
consumers can share experiences that feed into a discoverable online repository that inﬂ uences 
all those who embark on a similar journey. Without content or conversations that offer positive 
experiences at each step, there can be no hope for preference or a decision in your favor. And, 
without positive experiences there is no opportunity to establish customer loyalty or advocacy.
The dynamic customer journey is among the most important steps in the discovery process. My 
work at Altimeter Group has further validated this research and its importance in both making 
the case for digital transformation and for developing targeted and meaningful strategies. 

97
THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Together with Charlene Li, Alan Weber, Rebecca Lieb, Susan Etlinger, and Jeremiah Owyang, 
we’ve researched what this journey looks like for ﬁ nancial institutions, biopharmaceutical 
companies, insurance providers, government organizations, auto manufacturers, fashion brands, 
and everything in between. During my research for my previous book, I also studied the DCJ’s 
dimensions with small and local businesses. While the touch points and sources of inﬂ uence 
change, there are consistencies throughout everyone’s journey. But the point is that the journey 
is constantly evolving and revealing.
When it comes to which side of the dollar you wish to be on, walking through DCJ answers that 
question each and every time . . . over time. It helps you to prioritize investments in technology 
networks and platforms at every stage of the journey—through every moment of truth. It reveals 
which experiences are shared, where experiences fall apart. It introduces who inﬂ uences one 
another where and what happens next. It opens the door to networks of relevance during each 
stage of the decision-making cycle.

We do not see things

them as we are.
— The Talmud

101
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
To deﬁ ne the dynamic customer journey (DCJ) in a way that’s meaningful, advantageous, and 
shareable for your organization and your customers you’ll need to open your mind, your heart, 
and your imagination.1
It is only by walking in the digital footsteps of your customers that you can uncover a new 
landscape of opportunities for engagement, as well as a new reality for your business. 
Embracing your connected customers will help them embrace you in return. At a minimum, the 
gifts you receive by embarking on this journey and investing in engagement, education, and 
meaningful experiences are empathy, relevance, and ultimately reciprocity—all of which are 
measurable by traditional business metrics.
It’s time to deﬁ ne the experience where the product brings that experience to life and the 
technologies you employ contribute to that experience. You are the new CEO . . . the chief 
experience ofﬁ cer.

102
CHAPTER 10
Walking through a simple and quick example of the DCJ by using fashion retailer American 
Eagle as an example, you can identify and organize shared experiences across various social 
networks into various moments of truth. As Gen C takes to search engines and status updates 
to research, ask and answer questions, and share experiences, several opportunities present 
themselves for businesses to listen, learn, engage, and adapt.
1 
Listen to how people communicate following various stimuli, messages, and new 
information sources to learn how customers are guided to take their next steps from 
awareness to consideration and evaluations (the Zero Moment of Truth).
2 
Learn how customer journeys unfold based on the information that comes back in their 
discovery process. Who are the experts? What are the communities where people go? 
Who inﬂ uences them? What do they ﬁ nd and learn? What technologies and services do 
they use? What happens as a result?

103
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
3 
Engage customers in each moment of truth based on their expectations and the 
opportunities presented to provide value or resources.
4 
Adapt processes, strategies, and technology investments to improve steps 1 to 3.
As you’ll soon see, the dynamic customer journey presents moments of truth that either lead 
people to you or away from you. Each moment is yours to deﬁ ne. The journey is rich with data, 
relevant networks, inﬂ uential authorities and peers, and also technology sources.
To help you make sense of the DCJ in your work, let’s look at each stage at a high level. 

104
CHAPTER 10
FORMULATION (STIMULUS)
Without awareness of an option there can be no 
consideration of choosing it. Every touch point is open 
to disruption directly and indirectly. The effectiveness of 
your marketing, whether a derivative of paid, earned, or 
owned media, represents a trigger that sparks the dynamic 
customer journey for connected customers. What’s different 
now are the channels, techniques, and times your messages 
can reach people.
The question for you to answer is how you can use new 
media to stimulate awareness and consideration in ways that 
complement the customer journey.
ROLE MODEL: TOMS
TOMS Shoes partnered with 8thBridge to spread the word about its One for One movement 
while promoting social commerce in the news feed. Using Facebook’s Open Graph, “Shoppable 
Stories” let consumers click “Want,” “Love,” or “Own” on TOMS ecommerce site, which sends 
an update to Facebook, allowing friends to do the same within the news feed. This stimulus 
introduces TOMS into the streams of individuals using friends as the marketing medium and 
relationships as the currency.

CHAPTER 10
PRECOMMERCE (ZERO 
MOMENT OF TRUTH)
Purchases are researched, inﬂ uenced by 
social proof, or impulse driven. Your business 
must contribute to the exchange, research, 
and discovery process to drive resulting 
actions.
Here, stimuli trigger the act of search 
and conversations to learn more about 
businesses or brands. In the Zero Moment of 
Truth, your brand presence and discoverability are tested. The stimulus, whether created by you 
or your competition, reveals information about your product or service and that of others. The 
strength of your brand, the quality of results to every search query in every network, the words 
people use as they answer questions or share experiences, and the caliber of reviews in every 
network determine your customer’s next steps and the fate of your organization in the decision-
making cycle.
What people hear and say in the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) ﬁ rst requires understanding and 
then deﬁ nition. What comes back in the ZMOT should not be left to chance. The journey is far 
more complex than the funnel ever imagined.
See, unlike the traditional funnel where brands are narrowed through research, the number 
of considerations actually goes up based on what is uncovered through discovery and 
engagement. It is what is asked, shared, and what comes back that tests your brand’s 
performance in discoverability.
[ 
]

107
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Any business plugged into social listening can uncover in real time opportunities for 
engagement. This is what’s called a moment of interruption . . . similar to a common question 
that’s asked on the dance ﬂ oor, “May I cut in?”
What you say, how, and when contributes to the impression of your prospect and more 
importantly, what happens next.
The questions you need to answer here and in each step of the journey are: What experiences 
do you want people to share and what actions do you want to happen next?
In this stage, peers and trusted experts also shape and steer impressions and next steps. Find 
them. Learn from them. Engage them.

108
CHAPTER 10
ROLE MODEL: GIANTNERD
Giantnerd built a social platform that’s “Powered by Love” and depends on consumer presence, 
opinions, wants, and needs. Consumers earn rewards for being social and helping others with 
decisions. These rewards can then be applied to future purchases.
Randall Weidberg, nerd in charge, believes that consumer engagement helps in the ZMOT and 
also the Ultimate Moment of Truth (UMOT). Most notably, community interaction improves the 
overall experience, loyalty, and advocacy as a result. “We want the wisdom of the crowd to help 
consumers make more educated purchases.”

109
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
COMMERCE (FIRST 
MOMENT OF TRUTH)
As consumers collect information from their 
trusted sources, they move into a secondary 
stage of ZMOT and also the First Moment 
of Truth. They’re likely to do one last bit of 
research before committing to the purchase. 
Here your product should shine to sway your 
customer’s decision. But again, what comes 
back in search, in conversations, or through 
technology contributes to the next steps.
In a retail setting, this is the moment when 
your customers whip out a mobile device to 
compare prices, scan a bar code, check their 
preferred geo-location app, read mobile 
reviews, and snap and share pictures to send out 
to the social graph for feedback. The truth is that 
customers shop for the best deal and advice and 
they will abandon the transaction if you don’t 
engage—at the right time.
As your customers look at the packaging, talk 
to representatives or peers, the First Moment of 
Truth takes over. This is also dubbed the Amazon 
moment where customers compare prices and 
experiences through their mobile device. Best Buy 
and Target, among other retailers, are struggling 
[

110
CHAPTER 10
with this moment as customers naturally want to know if the store they are in will match the 
online price. Technology isn’t the only thing that needs to change. Dated policies and processes 
are also in dire need of updating. When a customer asks if a price can be matched by showing 
an app or site that lists a lower price, the answer is usually no. Perhaps it’s time to revisit that 
and other policies and technologies that encourage in-the-moment engagement.
The smoother you can make the transaction, the easier it is to ensure that your customers will 
continue the journey through to the Second and Ultimate Moments of Truth. This isn’t just 
about reducing friction in the information and commerce channels you choose to support. 
This is about meeting the discerning needs and expectations of your connected customers in 
the channels and through the screens they prefer. We are indeed becoming a digital society 
of multitaskers and multiscreeners. As such, you need to invest in a multichannel strategy that 
appeals to common interests and behavior, which without research is just using new technology 
because it’s in fashion.
The image below visualizes how different age groups use technology to make purchases. Simply 
by grouping the people who are comfortable or prefer using mobile devices to make purchases, 
you can justify a dedicated mobile commerce strategy while still investing in traditional and 
desktop/laptop-based commerce models. Investing in technology and engagement strategies

111
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
by interest and behavior requires a shift from demographic to psychographic segmentation and 
targeting.
As you can see, an astounding 50 percent of Millennials are already making purchases on mobile 
phones, 79 percent are purchasing via tablets, and 89 percent are buying through ecommerce. 
That’s not new. The reality is though that these numbers are moving toward pervasiveness 
across smaller screens, which require dedicated experiences to be designed. If you compare 
the numbers on the preceding page to the broader Gen C behavior, you realize that your smart 
phone and tablet strategy is most likely missing the bigger opportunity. This is about more than 
creating an app for your business. This is about a distributed yet integrated experience where 
information and conversations are the conduits to commerce.
Posttransaction, the Second Moment of Truth becomes essential as it fortiﬁ es impressions and 
gives way to the Ultimate Moment of Truth—the experience customers share with others in the 
inﬂ uence loop.
If you think that product experiences are out 
of your realm of responsibility, think again. 
In a postcommerce era where everyone is connected through shared experiences in this 
dynamic customer journey, your product or service is as much a part of marketing as everything 
else in your strategy.
In this Second Moment of Truth, the experience that you design is paramount. For if you don’t 
design what it is you want people to feel, think, embrace, and do, that experience will be 
deﬁ ned for you.
Striving to improve experiences requires learning how to improve products. Even the almighty 
Apple tracks feedback and experiences to improve its products and services. Doing so, it 
realized long ago, not only improves experiences, its better experiences can command a 
premium.

112
CHAPTER 10
POSTCOMMERCE 
(ULTIMATE MOMENT 
OF TRUTH)
The most interesting aspects of the 
DCJ and either the most beneﬁ cial or 
detrimental to your business, is the 
Ultimate Moment of Truth. The truth 
here is that product experiences are 
broadcast back into the same channels 
that inﬂ uenced customers’ decisions 
in the ﬁ rst place, thus becoming part 
of the inﬂ uence loop and the Ultimate 
Moment of Truth.
Consumers will share their experiences, 
good and bad, now and throughout 
the lifetime of the product usage. These shared experiences also contribute to the future 
decisions (ZMOT) of others indeﬁ nitely.
Postcommerce experiences contribute to the state of the customer relationship. Great products 
and services contribute to loyalty. Great engagement inspires advocacy. Underestimating 
experience says everything about how you value customers. You reap what you sow. Shared 
experiences, whether good or bad, are what you earn or deserve.
Every day, an increasing number of connected consumers is taking to social networks to ask for 
help or express sentiment related to business or product-related experiences; some consumers 
do so to seek resolution from their peers, others broadcast comments as a form of catharsis, 
and a smaller group of consumers actually hopes to receive a response directly from the 
company.
[ 
]

113
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
The reality is that social media is the new normal. A myriad of social networks, whether you use 
them or not, are now part of the day-to-day digital lifestyle with Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, and 
YouTube, among others, becoming the places where your customers connect, communicate, 
and engage around experiences. They take to these social networks and more because they 
can. The question is: What are you doing about it?
In the Ultimate Moment of Truth, customers are deﬁ ning the next steps or the ZMOT of others 
simply by what they contribute in the experience loop.
The importance of deﬁ ned experiences is just the beginning. It is the investment in a proactive 
support ecosystem of desirable experiences that not only inﬂ uence, but reinforce the 
experience you want people to embrace and, in turn, share.
Businesses will learn to engage in new networks one of two ways: Either businesses will 
recognize the opportunity to earn relevance through “aha” moments, or they’ll say “uh-oh” 
upon witnessing the impact of a crisis on business, branding, and customer inﬂ uence when a 
negative experience goes viral.
Brands are no longer created; they’re co-created.

114
CHAPTER 10
The image on the preceding page is a word cloud generated by the tweets of customers who 
shared their experiences regarding @United (United Airlines). I removed the colorful language 
as this isn’t a discussion about United, but instead how customer experiences are shared and 
how they inﬂ uence impressions and decisions. Additionally, this is an example of the necessary 
examination of how businesses are shaping and reacting to customer experiences in the midst 
of a digital revolution.
The two words that stand out clearly and represent the importance of our focus over the next 
several years are . . . customer service. If you look closely enough, you’ll see two other words 
surrounding customer service, which symbolize the importance of a renewed or new customer 
focus . . . response and change.
In a study published by Maritz Research and evolve24 in 2011,2 just less than 1,300 consumers 
were asked about their experiences with Twitter and customer service. As the respondents’ 
ages increased, so did their expectations that companies would read and respond to their 
experiences.

115
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Imagine that you are a connected consumer using 
Twitter to lodge a complaint and get a response that 
could solve a problem and retain you as a customer, 
only to be disappointed by the absence of a response. 
That’s exactly what happened to the respondents 
of the survey. Just over 70 percent said that they 
did not hear back from a company they reached out 
to on Twitter. This sets up a bigger problem if the 
company is in fact on Twitter. It tells consumers that 
their experience is unimportant and that the business 
is only present in social networks to market or sell 
products and not to provide help. Saying nothing to 
customers with a problem says everything about how 
you value them.
Providing resolution is only one part of the value 
proposition. Engagement is deﬁ ned as the interaction 
between a brand and a consumer, but it is in how it’s 
measured that counts.
Source: Reprinted with permission from IBM. 
Engagement isn’t measured by Likes, comments, impressions, tweets, or retweets. Engagement is measured 
by the takeaway value, sentiment, and resulting actions following the exchange. People have said that they’ve 
felt better once they were contacted by a company representative on Twitter. That says everything. . . .

116
CHAPTER 10
Customer service is important. But experiences supersede service. See, without investment 
in positive experiences, people are forever going to inquire about everything you didn’t 
anticipate.
Let’s look at fashion retail for a moment. Conversocial3 studied customer service responses on 
Twitter across 10 major U.S. clothing brands. The company found that 50 percent of customer 
complaints were never answered at all. Of these, 48 percent were customer issues with direct 
queries to the company; only 9 percent of the tweets were negative comments that criticized 
companies without really looking for help. We’re already missing opportunities to ﬁ x, improve, 
and create remarkable experiences.
It’s not just about online engagement, however. Loyalty and eventually advocacy are driven 
by what people actually undergo during the Second Moment of Truth and how they translate 
emotion and experience in the Ultimate Moment of Truth. With connected customers, 
traditional loyalty or reward programs don’t really apply. These programs must be reengineered 
to ensure an ongoing positive experience and reafﬁ rm customer value posttransaction. So many 
connected customers—wait, so many customers in general—feel that their value to a business 
ends when the transaction is completed in the commerce stage. Research in the DCJ shows that 
customers aren’t quite sold on your product or your brand just because they made the purchase. 
They run through the ellipse again with the intention of veriﬁ cation, participation, and validation.

117
INSIDE THE ELLIPSE: EMBARKING ON THE DYNAMIC CUSTOMER JOURNEY
Again, direct engagement is key here. Interruption isn’t just open to your business; it’s open 
to your competitors to engage your customers as well. Guiding these critical next steps will 
determine whether your customer abandons ship, becomes a promoter, or far worse, manifests 
a negative experience that impacts other consumers in the inﬂ uence loop.
ROLE MODEL: GIFFGAFF
In working with Lithium,4 I learned about giffgaff, a “SIM card–only” mobile virtual network 
operator based in the United Kingdom. Giffgaff is a company that’s run by its members. They 
are rewarded for running parts of the business, such as important functions including sales, 
marketing, and service. Customers who answer questions in the community, help recruit new 
members, and promote the company earn rewards. This helps the company to reduce operating 
costs and it passes the savings back to members. As in the Giantnerd example, customers are 
wildly supportive of the company as it creates not only a vibrant community but one where they 
are rewarded for their engagement.
To a giffgaff customer, experiences are everything. If a question or problem arises in the 
community, it is answered within 90 seconds, 24 hours a day. NPS? Net reputation score? 
Satisfaction? By investing in proactive experiences and rewarding customers for their 
engagement, customer satisfaction soared to 90 percent.5
The company also launched an Ideas Board, similar to Dell’s IdeaStorm and Starbucks’s 
MyStarbucks Idea, to funnel customer engagement and shape the business. To date, giffgaff 
has received more than 6,000 ideas and more than 50,000 comments, with the company 
implementing—on average—one member idea every three days.
Imagine that . . . positive experiences are becoming a competitive advantage in a day and age 
when poor customer engagement and service is unfortunately a commodity.
In the end, transformation isn’t easy, but if it were, then providing exceptional customer 
experiences would become a commodity. This is a time when customers can work for you 
not just against you. And as customers are demonstrating every day in social and mobile 
networks, without a thoughtful approach or engagement, every tweet, update, post, video, 
and interaction is working against you right now. Customer relationships are to be shaped, not 
simply reacted to or managed. This is why your participation matters now more than ever.

IMPROVING THE UMOT TO 
OPTIMIZE THE ZMOT

We must not let go 
manifest truths 
because we cannot 
answer all questions 
about them.
—Jeremy Collier

121
IMPROVING THE UMOT TO OPTIMIZE THE ZMOT 
Sounds almost playful; it certainly made me smile as I wrote it. But it is a profound topic 
nonetheless. If there is one thing you take away from this experience, it’s that the experiences 
people share inﬂ uence the steps other people take and the decisions they ultimately make.  
No matter how brilliant your marketing efforts, there is no one way to reach your desired 
audiences nor to create coveted impressions. The power of peer-to-peer inﬂ uence is perhaps 
at its greatest potency. Peer-driven word of mouth has always held a powerful relationship 
between cause and effect. In the 1970s, Fabergé Organics reminded consumers of what’s 
possible when you combine useful products, emotional correlation, and happy customers. 
The result is shared experiences aka word of mouth, “If you tell two friends about Fabergé 
Organics shampoo with wheat germ oil and honey, then they’ll tell two friends, and so on 
and so on and so on.”1 While clever marketing, Fabergé’s point blank approach is exactly 
the point. It’s not what you say about you, it’s what others experience and say about you 
that counts.
To win in the Moments of Truth, and you have to win in each and every one, apply a simple 
but important framework to each strategy. But before you do, think of the Moments of Truth 
much in the same way as you do the funnel. Marketing, service, product development, sales, 
and so on, must align to not only complement one another but contribute to the experiences 
of customers from ZMOT to UMOT. Not doing so creates friction internally and externally. 
Those organizations that reduce friction and enhance experiences win. It’s as simple as that. 
Winning requires a simple framework built upon a solid foundation of internal collaboration: 
listen, learn, engage, and adapt to enhance and optimize your performance in each Moment 
of Truth (MOT):
1 
Listen to conversations speciﬁ c to your customers’ discovery process. Walk in their digital 
footsteps.
2 
Learn how key words, questions, and responses contribute to themes and how those 
themes evolve.
a. Apply those key words to learn how customers are engaged in ZMOT within social 
media.
b. Reﬁ ne your key word strategy based on how people are searching and interacting 
with one another.

122
CHAPTER 11
c. Apply these insights to SEM (search engine marketing) efforts.
d. Also, learn how customers are engaged in ZMOT for search today.
3 
Engage people in the ZMOT and become a respected and appreciated resource to your 
community.
a. Also, engage indirectly by developing a Second Moment of Truth (SMOT)-driven 
content strategy to win in ZMOT.
 i. YouTube videos.
 ii. Social-friendly website and/or landing pages.
 iii. Utility-driven brand pages in key social networks and communities.
 iv. Useful blog posts.
 v. Customer reviews and testimonials on social sites.
b. Engage customers in the UMOT as well. If there’s a problem, ﬁ x it. Fix it publicly and 
rapidly.
 i. Create a dedicated role or team to monitor UMOTs in important channels to 
convert negative experiences into positive outcomes.
4 
Adapt your strategies to improve the discovery journey and how you perform within it. 
And adapt internally to create frictionless experiences inside and outside the organization.
a. Create a path between shared experiences and product innovation and iterations.
b. Apply insights inside the organization to rethink roles, rules, and processes and how 
they can evolve to lead a more beneﬁ cial dynamic customer journey.

123
IMPROVING THE UMOT TO OPTIMIZE THE ZMOT 
From ZMOT to FMOT and SMOT to UMOT, shared experiences are the ties that bind decision 
making. Even though this isn’t the 1970s, the old Fabergé commercial still rings true. The 
difference is that your customer will tell more than two friends and they will tell more than two 
friends. With access to mobile, social, and the Internet anytime anywhere, friends, experiences, 
impressions, and expressions are available on demand. As such, there’s no need for surprises 
in what those interactions look like. Yes, make incredible products. Yes, offer helpful sales and 
fantastic customer support. Market with creativity and vigor. But, also design the types of 
experiences you want shared in every Moment of Truth. Appreciate the truth for what it is today. 
Then take control of your fate by not fearing or controlling the truth.

Understanding the Psychology of Engagement

The greatest 
discovery of my 
generation is that 
human beings can 
alter their lives 
by altering their 
attitudes of mind.
—William James

127
THE SIX PILLARS OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
Social media is more about social science than technology.1 As we look at the dynamic customer 
journey (DCJ) and the moments of truth, we see that the opportunity before us—connected 
consumerism—is bigger than social media. It’s about experience. As such, its value is not 
realized in the Likenomics2 of relationship status or in the scores that individuals earn by 
engaging in social networks.3
The value of digital experiences is rooted in people, relationships, and the meaningful actions 
between them. Yes, it’s not just social . . . it’s digital and real world experiences that count for 
everything. The value of branded experiences comes down to the role you play in listening, 
engaging, and delivering value to customers before, during, and posttransaction. Value is then 
measured through the exchange of social currencies that contribute to one’s capital within each 
network, including the capital associated with your brand. Through conversations, what we 
share, and the content we create, consume, and curate, we individually invest in the commerce 
of information and the relationships that naturally unfold.4 It is in how these relationships 
take shape that is both in and out of your control. This is why, in the age of social and mobile 
networking, relevant engagement and ensuring experiences matter.

128
CHAPTER 12
HEAR NO EVIL. 
SEE NO EVIL. 
SPEAK NO EVIL.
Online conversations about you take place even if your organization isn’t around to hear it. 
Some business leaders actually believe that creating a presence in social networks erodes at 
the control of the brand, risking the consumer governance they’ve theoretically held onto 
so triumphantly over the years. If that logic holds, by not engaging in the dynamic customer 
journey or by sharing only one dimension of your business online, you can control what people 
think and say online and in each moment of truth.
However, the truth is that new media did 
not “invent” conversations, experiences, 
or opinions.
The control you think you lose by opening up to online engagement actually gives you control. 
While we are measured by our actions and words, we are also measured by our inaction and 
silence. Once you understand what people say and don’t say, how they connect, what they 
share, how they discover and make decisions, who inﬂ uences them, and whom they inﬂ uence, a 
blueprint for experiences emerges. Think of it as experience architecture.
People will talk about you whether you are there to hear it or not. The questions you have to 
answer are: What do you want them to say? What do you want them to do? and What do you 
want them to feel? Answer these questions and you start to design intentional experiences.
[

129
THE SIX PILLARS OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
THE A.R.T. OF 
ENGAGEMENT
In the dynamic customer journey, the social sciences of psychology, anthropology, 
communication, economics, human geography, and so on, are essential in building meaningful 
relationships, guiding relevant experiences, and inﬂ uencing mutually beneﬁ cial behavior. 
This means that you must ﬁ rst articulate and ultimately design what it is you want the user 
experience to emulate or evoke.
The concept of social architecture—the A.R.T. of Engagement—is where actions, reactions, 
and transactions become the fabric of holistic and connected experiences.5 It’s not as easy 
as deploying campaigns and landing pages. The click path, the outcomes, and the stated 
value must be optimized, efﬁ cient, and worthy of sharing. This is where social science and, in 
particular, psychology come into play. You must design an experience that captivates the mind 
or feeds likely emotions to affect desirable behavior in a given context.
[

130
CHAPTER 12
THE PSYCHOLOGY 
OF SOCIAL COMMERCE
The importance of social psychology 
cannot be overstated. This branch of 
psychology deals with how people think 
about inﬂ uence and how individuals 
relate to one another. In social networks, 
the social economy is deﬁ ned by how 
people earn and spend social capital. 
Based on the commerce of actions, words, 
and intentions (or actions, reactions, 
and transactions), individuals contribute 
to their own standing. You earn the 
relationships and the resulting stature that 
you deserve.
One day while catching up on the latest 
news online, I stumbled across a rather 
interesting infographic developed by 
TabJuice that creatively communicated 
the psychology of social commerce. The 
graphic was inspired by a series of studies 
based on the work of Robert Cialdini. 
The infographic visualized Cialdini’s6 Six Principles of Inﬂ uence7 that consumers use to make 
decisions. Referred to as thinslicing, consumers tend to ignore most information available and 
instead slice off a few relevant information or behavioral cues that are often social to make 
intuitive decisions.

HEURISTIC NUMBER 1: SOCIAL 
PROOF—FOLLOW THE CROWD
[ 
]
During the dynamic customer journey, consumers may ﬁ nd themselves at a point of indecision. 
When consumers are uncertain of what to do next, social proof kicks in to see what others are 
doing or have done.
To inﬂ uence decisions, wish lists, popularity lists, social sharing, reviews, and social 
recommendations become paramount.

HEURISTIC NUMBER 2: 
AUTHORITY—THE GUIDING LIGHT
[ 
]
Authority in social media is not only related to commerce, but it is the very source of how 
interest graphs take shape. During the dynamic customer journey, authorities guide in effective 
decision making. Authorities have invested their time, resources, and activity in earning a 
position of inﬂ uence, and their reward for doing so is a community of loyalists who place trust in 
their recommendations.
In Edelman’s most recent Trust Barometer report, academics and experts topped the list for 
trust and credibility (66 percent), followed by a technical expert at a company (66 percent).8

HEURISTIC NUMBER 3: 
SCARCITY—LESS IS MORE
[ 
]
A function of supply and demand, greater value is assigned to the resources that are, or are 
perceived to be, less available. Driven by the fear of loss or the stature of self-expression, 
consumers are driven by the ability to participate as members in exclusive deals. Part afﬁ nity, 
part elitism, consumers have expressed over and over that the ability to have early or select 
access to offers and promotions is a top reason to connect in social media.

There’s an old saying in business: People do business with people they like. That statement is 
never truer than in social media. Revisiting the Edelman Trust Barometer, the third most trusted 
person is someone like yourself/peers (65 percent). We have a natural inclination to emulate 
those we like, admire, and ﬁ nd attractive, because these attributes also contribute to the “guilt 
by association” impression of self-identity.

RECIPROCITY—PAY IT FORWARD

Perhaps the greatest asset in social capital is that of benevolence. It’s easy to get caught up in a 
cycle of paying it backward, where we expect to be paid or rewarded for our goods, services, or 
actions. However, those who invest in helping others or in paying it forward will earn something 
greater than a reaction; they will earn a repository of reciprocity. As human beings, we have an 
innate desire to repay favors to maintain a balance of social fairness whether or not those favors 
were invited.

The psychology of social commerce reveals the emotional elements that activate desirable 
consumer behavior in each moment of truth throughout the dynamic customer journey. It is the 
understanding of the six pillars of social commerce that facilitates the development of a more 
cohesive and connected online experience for customers. More importantly, by investing in 
the value, productivity, and efﬁ ciency of consumer decision making and not just the outcome, 
businesses can not only earn reciprocity and goodwill, but also earn social capital as a result . . . 
and that’s priceless.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND IN AN 
ERA OF DIGITAL DARWINISM

The trouble with 
learning from 
experience is that 
you never graduate.
—Doug Larson attributed, 
The Ship of Thought

141
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND IN AN  ERA OF DIGITAL DARWINISM
Now more than ever, what your organization stands for and what it represents can be the 
foundation for a meaningful competitive advantage. The journey we walked through together in 
the last several chapters presents a connected customer whose values, personal beliefs, and life 
experiences combined with personal and professional objectives create the need for personal 
engagement.
It’s not a debate of apathy versus empathy: businesses must align with individuals in order for 
individuals to stand with businesses. Your organization must go beyond being customer-centric.
Think about the deﬁ nition of community. The textbook deﬁ nition of community is a group of 
people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common. At the moment, 
most businesses do not have an understanding of what a community is and why customers do 
or do not align with it. Nor does an organization have a singular customer view because the 
organization is siloed to slice up the customer divisionally, by function and by the desired result. 
Departments don’t talk to one another because they’re not measured by collaboration efforts; 
they’re measured by the performance of their function. The traditional funnel no longer works 
on connected customers. It’s far too dynamic and the evolution is spinning the ellipse faster 
than your business is adapting its vision, mission, and models to react.

142
CHAPTER 13
The reality is that there isn’t a top-down movement to create a singular experience for the 
customer. As such, there isn’t a uniﬁ ed movement within to embrace the customer in something 
more signiﬁ cant than transactional relationships.
This has to change.
The future of community requires greater depth of understanding and intention. Community 
is much more than being a part of something; it’s about doing something together that makes 
being a part of something matter. Community must have a purpose.
To build a true community starts with your vision statement. It is enlivened by your brand. You 
must deﬁ ne the experience you want people to have with your brand and align that experience 
with everything that you do. From product development to support to sales and marketing 
to packaging and presentation to the ethos that ﬁ lls every hallway, ofﬁ ce, and conference 
room that make up your organization and your brand, you must construct something that’s 
aspirational and worthy of community.
Think of your favorite brand, and the ﬁ rst thing to come to mind is likely a logo, such as the 
Coca-Cola scripting, a tagline, such as Nike’s “Just do it,” or a jingle—remember the Oscar 
Meyer Wiener song? These may be the aspects of a brand you remember, but they are no 
longer the most important aspects of branding today. Identity, persona, essence, and promise 
are the new kings and queens of the branding kingdom, thanks to technology and the deeper 
connections it opens up between brands and consumers.
Markets, consumer behavior, and how businesses connect with customers are all directly 
impacted by technology.1 Looking at the rapid erosion of Blockbuster’s business model, it’s 
clear to see the impact that technology can have on consumer behavior.2 During Blockbuster’s 
initial bankruptcy ﬁ ling, CNBC’s Faber Report summarized it this way: “At the end of the day, 
this is one of those bankruptcies that’s not really about a ﬁ nancial situation as much as it’s about 
seminal changes in how people ultimately watch video.”
The increasingly important role of technology, combined with global economic unrest, means 
that a company’s brand is more important today than it has ever been. Consumers, in search 
of certainty, rely heavily on a brand’s symbolism and signiﬁ cance. We don’t have to look much 

143
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND IN AN  ERA OF DIGITAL DARWINISM
further than Netﬂ ix for a recent example of what happens when executives misread the impact 
of technology and consumer demand and, in turn, make decisions that have negative effects on 
the business and the brand.
In the case of Netﬂ ix and its double whammy of uninformed business decisions, Reed Hastings 
and company raised prices, which sent customers into an uproar. Feeling the effects of negative 
sentiment from a full-blown PR crisis and a declining stock price, Netﬂ ix then opted to divide 
the company into two entities: Qwikster would handle DVDs and Netﬂ ix would focus on digital 
and streaming. However, Netﬂ ix customers weren’t ready for such a bold move in what was 
largely regarded as an unnecessary direction. The company caved to consumer and investor 
pressure and folded the two entities back under Netﬂ ix, killing off Qwikster as quickly as it had 
been introduced.
Netﬂ ix now must focus on rebuilding its brand to earn and re-earn trust before it can take 
another aggressive move into the future. Yet, any form of market research that studied 
conversations in social networks or quite simply, a customer engagement program would have 
revealed the state of consumer needs in the ﬁ rst place.
Brands that fail to instill a level of conﬁ dence in their consumers run the risk of failing. The 
brands that survive this era of economic disruption will be the ones that are best able to evolve 
because they recognize the need and opportunity to do so, before their competitors.

144
CHAPTER 13
BRANDING IS MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN EVER BEFORE
In 1984, Apple stunned the world with its now iconic “1984” commercial.3 It ﬁ rmly established 
Apple’s brand and ultimately set the stage for the company’s signiﬁ cance in the emerging 
personal computers market. The commercial attained legendary status, but Apple, like every 
brand, would still need to relentlessly compete for attention and relevance.
A year later, Apple attempted to match its previous success with “Lemmings,” a commercial 
that dramatized the lemming-like behavior of the PC-based work force.4 The ad, while arguably 
brilliant, was widely considered a ﬂ op, because the image of businesspeople following one 
another over a cliff confused customers. Over time, Apple’s brand slowly degraded, losing 
touch with its core audience and missing an opportunity to connect with the growing base of 
consumers seeking personal computers.
When Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he was on a mission to not only turn around the 
company he had co-founded, but also to rebrand the company to connect with consumers. In a 
recently surfaced internal video, Jobs focused on the importance of brand as he introduced the 
employees to its iconic advertising campaign, “Think Different.”5
“For me, marketing is about values,” said Jobs. “This is a very noisy world and we’re not going 
to get a chance to get people to remember much about us. So, we have to be very clear what 
we want them to know about us.”
The company then looked inward in an attempt to answer the questions: Who is Apple? What 
does it stand for and where does the brand ﬁ t in the world?
[ 
]

145
THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND IN AN  ERA OF DIGITAL DARWINISM
What we’re about isn’t making boxes for people to get their jobs done,” said Jobs 
during the company meeting. “Apple’s core value is that we believe people with 
passion can change the world . . . for the better. Those people, crazy enough to think 
that they can change the world are the ones that actually do. . . . Here’s to the crazy 
ones.
The “Think Different” campaign would run from 1997 to 2002 and effectively rebrand Apple 
for years to come. But that was just one example of how the company would use branding to 
compete for attention and relevance over the years.
“
”

146
CHAPTER 13
BRAND EMPATHY: ALWAYS 
IMPROVE EXPERIENCES
In 2011, Millward Brown Optimor released its annual BrandZ survey that ranked and valued the 
world’s top brands.6
Apple surged to the number one spot, soaring 84 percent relative to its 2010 ranking. 
The company boasts a brand value estimated at $153 billion. Google came in second; 
however, its brand value fell by 2 percent to $111 billion. IBM came in third, with a 17 
percent increase in brand value year over year to tie Google at $111 billion. McDonald’s 
ranked fourth, growing 23 percent and earning a brand value of $81 billion.
Any other company would likely be thrilled to be in fourth place, but not McDonald’s. The 
company is undergoing its most extensive store-by-store makeover in the chain’s 56-year 
history. Gone are the famous yellow and red interior colors. The ﬁ berglass tables and steel 
chairs have also been removed. McDonald’s is adapting to a new era, creating an experience 
marked by muted colors, wooden tables, and faux leather chairs. And, that’s just the beginning. 
McDonald’s is pouring $1 billion into redesigning the consumer experience. The goal 
is to create an elegant and upscale presence similar to that of Starbucks, Chipotle, and 
Panera Bread.
As Jim Carras, senior vice president of domestic restaurant development for McDonald’s told 
USA Today, “McDonald’s has to change with the times and we have to do so faster than we 
ever have before.”7
Meanwhile, don’t expect Apple to slow down despite its newly minted, ﬁ rst-place position. 
Apple will continue to innovate, even as the company mourns the loss of its chief visionary. 
Expect Apple to continue to inspire meaningful experiences and establish a sense of 
unparalleled belonging. This is the charge of any brand that wants to stay at the top of the 
[

THE IMPORTANCE OF BRAND IN AN  ERA OF DIGITAL DARWINISM
brand value list. In the face of Digital Darwinism, reinvention, constant relevance, and perpetual 
value become the pillars for an adaptive business.
This begins with embracing a culture of innovation and adaptation—a culture that recognizes 
the impact of disruptive technology and how consumer preference and afﬁ nity are evolving. 
Social and mobile networks, tablets, smart phones, syndicated commerce, augmented 
reality, and gamiﬁ cation represent some of the game changers that businesses must either 
embrace or deeply study to determine bottom line impact. If an organization cannot recognize 
opportunities to further compete for attention and relevance, it cannot, by default, create 
meaningful connections or drive shareable experiences. The brand, as a result, will lose 
preference in the face of consumer choice, which may one day lead to its succumbing to 
Digital Darwinism.
Perhaps Jobs said it best: “This is a very noisy world . . . So, we have to be very clear what we 
want them to know about us.”
I would just add: “And never stop.”
As you think about the experience you wish customers to have before, during, and following 
transactions, think about what it is they’re thinking, feeling, seeing, and touching in every 
step. This is the experience. Now, what people share in the Ultimate Moment of Truth are the 
experiences that, in turn, deﬁ ne your brand.
Give people something to stand with, 
something to believe in. 
A strong community is the net result of something designed to be meaningful and remarkable. 
The brand is then a collection of shared experiences aimed at creating alignment between your 
vision and customer aspiration.

WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL 
TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS

Nothing is a waste of 
time if you use the 
experience wisely.
—Auguste Rodin

151
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
The dynamics that govern the relationship between brands and customers are evolving. But 
even in this era of engagement and two-way conversations, shared experiences, and connected 
consumerism, the reality is that the relationship businesses hope to have with customers 
through these new devices, applications, or networks and their true state are not one and the 
same.1 In fact, it is woefully one-sided, and usually not to the advantage of customers.
Rather than examine the role new technologies and platforms can play in improving customer 
relationships and experiences, many businesses invest in “attendance” strategies where a brand 
is present in both trendy and established channels, but there’s no focus on deﬁ ning meaningful 
experiences or outcomes. Simply stated, businesses are underestimating the signiﬁ cance of 
customer experiences in even the briefest of exchanges.
Some of the biggest trends today—mobile, geo-location, social, real time—are 
changing how consumers discover and share information and connect with one another. 
Technology aside, consumers are driving the rapid adoption of technology because of the 
capabilities that are unlocked through each device. From self-expression and validation to 
communication and connections to knowledge and collaboration, new opportunities are 
available in each new device and platform.

152
CHAPTER 14
As smart and connected technology matures beyond a luxury into everyday commodities, 
consumer expectations increase. As a result, functionality, connectedness, and experiences 
emerge as lures for attention. For brands to compete for attention now takes something greater 
than mere presences in the right channels or support for the most popular devices. Experience 
is much more than a moment—experience is about a movement.
For those who live in the world of design and development, user experience (UX) is 
sovereign. For those unfamiliar with the term, looking beyond mere website design, UX is the 
art and science of shaping how people feel about a product or how they engage with a service. 
UX is a critical enabler of meaningful and shareable experiences and, therefore, its role in the 
future of business and customer satisfaction is vital. An empowered UX team can provide a 
powerful competitive advantage.
UX is much more than design and development. Yet among executives, UX is misunderstood 
and often undervalued if it’s acknowledged at all. But the message that I want to send to 
decision makers throughout the organization is that your UX team could be among the most 
informed and capable to improve customer experiences, relationships, loyalty, and overall 
business performance.
Why?
To connected customers, experience is everything. They don’t just buy products. They don’t 
just surf sites. They don’t randomly engage in social networks or everyday apps. They want 
experiences. It is what they buy. It is what they embrace. It is what they share.
In this social and connected economy UX is a key competitive advantage and is instrumental 
in how your business recognizes customers to compete for experiences now and in the future. 
For without thoughtful UX, consumers meander without direction, reward, or utility. And their 
attention, and ultimately loyalty, follows. 

153
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
THE CRUX OF ENGAGEMENT IS 
INTENTION AND PURPOSE
Before we can tackle product design or product experiences, we must ﬁ rst recognize the 
role customers play in our business today and articulate how we envision relationships and 
experiences evolving over time.
Let’s start with a look at how companies approach new media today. Embracing new networks 
such as Facebook and Twitter, placing social and “viral” content on YouTube and in blogs, 
creating mobile apps and QR codes, hosting Pinteresting boards for products, is all ﬁ ne and 
good. But, even in the design of these new media strategies, many experiences consumers 
are having are vague, disjointed, or undeﬁ ned. There is very little vision that goes into deﬁ ning 
relationships and experiences in each of the networks as it is, let alone creating a holistic or 
consistent experience across every channel.
In many ways, experiences take a back seat to engagement. Rather than looking at people and 
the experiences we want them to have, businesses tend to look at new technology as the crux 
of engagement. However, without deﬁ ning the experiences that establish how people should 
think and feel, or what they should do next, engagement will always underperform against 
expectations.
Rather than looking at people and the experiences we want them to have, businesses tend to 
look at new technology as the crux of engagement. This is because many organizations suffer 
from what I call medium-alism, where inordinate value and weight are placed on the technology 
of any medium rather than on amplifying platform strengths and ideas to deliver desired and 
beneﬁ cial experiences and outcomes. Said another way, businesses are designing for the sake 
of designing, without regard for how someone feels, thinks, or acts as a result. 
[ 
]

154
CHAPTER 14
Rather than designing to evoke human emotion, platforms and devices take precedence over 
the human connection or aftereffect. Often products, pages, proﬁ les, and entire click paths are 
narcissistic in their overture in that they take into account the needs of decision makers and 
stakeholders over that of the customers they’re designed to entice. Often, the need to plug into 
trends trumps the opportunity to innovate and improve the customer journey.
Businesses also fall victim to what I refer to as creative endowment. This is a phenomenon in 
which creative professionals bestow upon executives their ideas for campaign. Here, technology 
becomes the stage for imagination without regard for the customer experience. Instead, these 
ideas, no matter how brilliant, are thrust on customer senses, what they see, hear, and touch, for 
the sake of executing against an idea rather than evoking a sensation or designing an outcome. 
This isn’t necessarily a new phenomenon, but it is a problem.
Thankfully, there’s a cure for medium-alism and creative endowment. UX is the new Rx for most 
new media deployments. UX goes beyond transitional user experience. From social networks to 
mobile apps to commerce to digital to product unboxing or usage, experiential strategies form 
the bridge where intentions meet outcomes. By starting with the end in mind, UX packages 
efﬁ ciency and enchantment to deliver more meaningful, engaging, and rewarding consumer 
journeys.
It’s easier said than done, however.
UX is an art and science, and it is all but ignored in the development of new media channels 
where customers control their own fate. If the appeal of an app diminishes, it’s removed from 
the device. If a brand page in a social or mobile network no longer delivers value, a customer 
can effortlessly unlike, unfollow, or unsubscribe. If the rewards for taking action on behalf of 
a brand—think check-ins, QR, bar code scans, or augmented reality plays—are intangible, or 
gimmicky without intent, customers will simply power off. And, if a consumer cannot take action 
in your favor, within their channel of relevance, with ease and elegance, they will not see the 
value or return on investment (ROI) in being in your community.
Agencies, brand or product managers, developers, consultants, and anyone responsible for any 
element of customer engagement can learn from the art and science of UX. To that end, UX is a 
role that should, in some way, shape, or form, ﬁ nd a home within the design of any experiential 
strategy today. And, eventually, if not already, UX should take residence in any function 
dedicated to product development and customer experience.

155
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
So you must ask:
• Who owns UX?
• Is UX connected to other critical business functions?
• Who owns mobile design and experiences today?
• Who understands the engagement dynamics of Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and other new 
networks and the difference in behavior between these networks and your website?
• Who on your team is a master of social science to better understand engagement, behavior, 
and expectations?
Often, creative strategies are driven by a clever idea and not necessarily an idea supported 
by an engaging design or experience. At the same time, many campaigns are developed for a 
medium or an event where the platform takes precedence over sentiment or desired results. 
When considered, the formula of experiences and outcomes is incredibly potent. But when 
deployed without direction, everything that results is left to happenstance.
Why risk it when you can design for it?

156
CHAPTER 14
THE EXPERIENCE REDUX
Certainly many brands are guilty of deploying technology strategies without designing a holistic 
experience. It’s the reason the result of a QR scan is a web page that’s—unsurprisingly—not 
optimized for mobile devices. It’s simply unacceptable that a QR experience would lead to a 
web page, anyway. Or what about the enthusiasm that precedes an Augmented Reality (AR) 
code? Your customers might think that a digital diorama is cute, but the novelty quickly fades.
Consider for a moment the curiosity that people feel going into either one of those scenarios. 
There’s a sense of mystery, curiosity, and anticipation for what comes next. Measuring ROI is the 
least of your worries here. Customer disappointment is the unintentional result of a thoughtless 
experience. Intent or desired outcomes are often thwarted by their very design, or lack thereof. 
The primary function of UX is the development of an architecture that creates a delightful, 
emotional, and sensory experience. This is why it’s vital to customer experiences and 
engagement. UX is, among many things, designed to be experiential, effective, useful, 
productive, and entertaining. And, most importantly, it’s devised with an end in mind where the 
means to that end is efﬁ cient and optimized for each scenario and channel.
Let’s take a look at the point of origin for the moment. Your smart phone, PC screen, and 
tablet open a window to a new experience that is unique to that device. It’s a looking glass into 
your world that goes beyond usability. Successful UX evokes engagement or purpose, affects 
sentiment, and inﬂ uences behavior. And this is why UX is so important. 
As Marshall McLuhan once said, “The medium is the message.” Now, the medium is not only 
the message, the medium is the experience. And that is why we cannot simply design for the 
medium; we must design the experience where the medium becomes an enabler to the journey 
and the end as devised.
[ 
]

157
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
Two words come to mind here: mission and purpose. Jesse James Garrett, author of The 
Elements of User Experience, once observed, “An information architect makes information work 
for people.” If we use his perspective as a springboard for new media, what businesses need 
now are new CEOs—chief experience ofﬁ cers. Brands must employ experience architects, as it 
is they who will carry the responsibility of designing the customer journey so that it is engaging, 
worthy of sharing, and uniﬁ ed regardless of platform.
Engagement is not a product or a campaign; it’s a continuum where experience is an enabler 
for a greater vision, mission, and outcome. And as such, the attention, impressions, and shared 
expressions that result are indeed reﬂ ective of what is both earned and deserved.

158
CHAPTER 14
USER EXPERIENCE BECOMES 
THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE: 
PRINCIPLES AND PILLARS OF UX
As in new media, when it comes to the development of customer-facing products, apps, 
displays, and destinations, businesses often miss two of the most critical elements for true 
customer engagement: evoking desired experiences and establishing desired sentiment. With 
the rapid innovation in technology, access becomes a commodity. Smart devices now extend, 
enable, and empower everyday customer behavior. And as a result, tablets, smart phones, PCs, 
the Internet of things, open new windows for engaging consumer touch points and deﬁ ning 
meaningful customer journeys. How organizations are embracing this opportunity today is only 
part of the story.
While technology is part of the storyline, it is in fact only a chapter in a bigger story about how 
technology can deliver meaningful user experiences and lead to more engaging customer 
relationships.
[ 
]

159
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
MEDIUM-ALISM EQUALS FAUX 
ENGAGEMENT
Now more than ever, user experience (UX) as a philosophy and as a practice serves as the 
architecture between customer engagement and resulting actions and sentiment. The problem 
is that businesses tend to have a narrow view of customer needs or expectations. More 
importantly, executives aren’t inviting UX teams to the table around critical business, product, 
and customer strategy development. UX brings a unique blend of empathy and understanding, 
which is a powerful ingredient during any creative or innovation session.
Human emotion and behavior are rousing and among the most inﬂ uential elements in 
experience design. I’d like to share an example with you. But before I do, I need to preface it 
with a disclaimer. The person I’m going to talk about, as a character, is the very antithesis of UX. 
But it is in this rare moment, where this character evokes personal memories and emotions for 
one brief moment, that he is human. He is the very person he is trying to reach.
I can’t help but think back to the Mad Men episode where Don Draper presents his touching 
concept for Kodak’s new wheel, aka “The Carousel”: www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus
In a dimly lit room and in a vulnerable voice, Draper takes us on a touching passage, 
“Technology is a glittering lure. But, there is the rare occasion where the public can be engaged 
at a level beyond ﬂ ash . . . if they have a sentimental bond with the product.”
Draper tells the story of his ﬁ rst in-house advertising job at a fur company and how his 
co-worker, a Greek copywriter named Teddy, explained the importance of combining what’s 
new with emotion. “He . . . talked about a deeper bond with a product, nostalgia. It’s delicate, 
but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound. 
It’s a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone.”
[ 
]

160
CHAPTER 14
Nostalgia, indeed, is a potent play. In this gripping scene, Draper doesn’t push a creative idea 
for the sake of the idea; instead he takes technology and makes it human. He makes it so 
human, in fact, that as you watch the scene, it becomes intimate, and it becomes personal. As 
such, viewers are reminded of the memories that they miss or cherish and for that moment, 
their experiences join the conﬂ uence of emotion, brand, and technology.
Here’s the important part . . . that scene—let’s pretend that was really the campaign Kodak 
considered—was designed to do just as I described. And, that’s the point. That campaign as 
conveyed would take center stage where technology, media, design, and the overall experience 
would be designed to evoke emotions and trigger a desired effect in any network or any 
platform or device.
This is the beginning of an important shift where neither technology nor creativity will lead the 
strategy for developing and steering customer experiences. Instead, intention and aspiration 
become the North Star. Technology and creativity merely become the enablers in the delivery of 
magical experiences and gratifying sentiment.

161
WHY USER EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS
THE JUXTAPOSITION OF 
EMPATHY AND EXPERIENCE
In UX, user experiences are interwoven with absorbing visual design packaged in a journey rich 
with empathy and desire. For UX to be effective, customer experience and design architects 
must ﬁ rst feel it. Effective engagement is inspired by empathy that develops simply by being 
human. It takes a holistic approach to truly deliver an empathetic voyage. Design, channels, 
and devices are not enough. It takes a culture of customer-centricity to feel their challenges and 
ambitions and what it is that they need or do not know they need. Again, it takes a vision and a 
higher purpose to inspire beneﬁ cial outcomes.
Businesses must reimagine the future of customer relationships and not only vocalize it, but 
express it as a working charter. It requires nothing short of a culture shift to truly appreciate the 
customers for not only what they can do but also how they feel.
Like so many things related to technology and new media, champions tend to push a 
bottom-up strategy. But, what must take place must complement the current groundswell by 
convincing executives and decision makers to lead top-down strategies that convey a vision for 
what customer experiences should involve. Only then can we inspire incredible UX to in turn 
bring that experience to life. Everything starts with deﬁ ning a vision that articulates the view 
of the customer journey not just as you see it, but what it is that customers would appreciate, 
relate to, and value.
Vision is device- and platform-agnostic. But as Mr. Draper expresses in Mad Men, it’s indeed 
“delicate, but potent.”
Businesses that place people and what they feel, think, do, and share as a priority in not just 
product design but overall marketing and business strategy outperform those who don’t. It’s 
about a journey that knows no end—only how to keep the passengers delighted and valued.

INNOVATE OR DIE

Good judgment 
comes from 
experience, and 
experience comes 
from bad judgment.
—Barry LePatner

165
INNOVATE OR DIE
By now you see that earning relevance requires much more than the adoption of the latest 
technologies or launching endeavors in the latest social or app ﬂ avor of the month.
In the last few chapters we learned the importance of user experience in product design 
and our overall channel strategies. It is through technology channels, though, that we reach 
customers in the moments of truth to favorably guide their journey. These channels aren’t 
selected arbitrarily. They are speciﬁ cally chosen to serve a purpose, to meet a need, and to elicit 
a desired outcome.
With all of the technology options and opportunities facing your organization, where do you 
even start? Believe it or not, it is in this very moment where your strategy will earn its merit. 
Without matching technology investments with customer behavior in the moments of truth 
and aligning everything with business outcomes, your strategy will earn the failure it deserves. 
We’re in this together, so let’s work together in this chapter to prioritize opportunities and place 
wise investments where they’ll count. In the process, we’ll develop a culture for recognizing 
emerging technology to adopt the right platforms before they become disruptive.

166
CHAPTER 15
What is Disruptive Technology? Let’s take a moment to deﬁ ne it. Disruptive technology is 
the ongoing innovations that emerge without expectation to introduce a new capability or 
solution that creates a market and value network at the expense of an existing market and value 
network.1 This is important because many organizations are investing in emerging technology 
for customer engagement, metrics, marketing and advertising, internal collaboration and 
education, HR, product development, and so on. But they do so without the clearest picture 
into overall direction, long-term strategy, or even a deep understanding of the expectations and 
obstacles that exist among customers and employees.
If we look at how organizations experiment with popular mobile and social platforms such as 
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Google+, Klout, Pinterest, and a whole list of others, 
we’re left to wonder whether a divide and conquer strategy really isn’t just another guise where 
businesses become a jack-of-all trades but a master of none.
That’s not the strategy we’re going 
to pursue together . . . 

167
INNOVATE OR DIE
CMOs ARE AT THE CROSSROADS 
OF CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS 
AND ENGAGEMENT
At the intersection of relevance and obsolescence is the ability to recognize opportunities for 
change based on shifting consumer behavior and the subtle coalescence between emerging 
and disruptive technology.2 Your businesses must learn that change is taking place today with 
or without you. To what extent varies from company to company. But without an understanding 
of how technology and society are evolving and how decisions are inﬂ uenced and made, 
businesses are left to make decisions in the dark.
We all know how difﬁ cult, if not nearly impossible, it is to change. We also realize that once 
we do begin the inevitable process of transformation, the distance between where we are 
and where we need to be is not expeditious in any sense. In the era of Digital Darwinism, the 
journey toward evolution and revolution is, in fact, the destination. It is perpetual.3
This is a time I must implore you to think differently. New technology, platforms, and channels 
are not the catalysts for change, but merely among its agents. For example, while Facebook 
and Twitter are often the recipients of accolades for their roles in fueling revolutions, we must 
remember that they are the networks that facilitate engagement.
In the world of business, customers are using new technology to share experiences. And, 
those experiences are either to your beneﬁ t or detriment. As Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas 
Mavericks and chairman of HDNet, shared in The End of Business as Usual, “To be successful 
in business, you need to see what others don’t.” To that I would also add, “and do what others 
won’t or can’t.”4
[

CHAPTER 15
THROUGH A TELESCOPE, WE 
BRING THE WORLD CLOSER—
THROUGH A MICROSCOPE, WE 
SEE WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY 
INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE
I often say, “in brevity, there’s clarity.” Although I still believe this to be true, I also see that 
there’s a delicate balance necessary in understanding what is hype and what is truly disruptive. 
Therefore, we must look forward and at the same time, look closer at what’s taking place right 
now to analyze true impact. Separating fact from ﬁ ction or hype from disruption is now part 
of our job as our consumers are driving these results based on what they adopt, how they 
communicate, and how they inﬂ uence and are inﬂ uenced in decision-making cycles. With so 
much information and change before us, where do we focus?
To help, IBM reached out to more than 1,700 chief marketing ofﬁ cers (CMOs), spanning 
19 industries and 64 countries as part of its CMO study,  one of the C-suite studies conducted 
by IBM’s Institute for Business Value.5 The goal was to learn how consumer behavior and 
technology are changing business focus, forecasts, and decisions. The results are both 
illuminating and helpful.
So, what’s keeping everyone up at night?
As you can see, big data, social media, and the myriad of available consumer channels and 
devices make up the top three trends leading to corporate insomnia. But beyond those trends, 
the entire list is fascinating and worthy of study.

CHAPTER 15
If we break out the expected level of complexity and preparedness to handle what lies ahead 
in terms of emerging versus disruptive technology, we surface what IBM refers to as the 
complexity gap. 
The IBM CMO study also reinforces my research and experiences with leading enterprises.6 
Businesses do indeed seek to get closer to customers. 
To that end, CMOs believe that there are three key areas for improvement:
1 
 Deliver value to empowered customers.
2 
 Foster lasting connections.
3 
 Capture value and measure results.
Addressing each of these items unlocks the true essence of the trends that are disrupting 
businesses today . . . customers are becoming increasingly connected and as a result, they are 
empowered, inﬂ uential, and increasingly elusive.
As Ann Glover, chief marketing ofﬁ cer, ING Insurance U.S., shared in the research report, 
“Customers today have more control and inﬂ uence with the brand than ever. We need to make 
sure it’s give and take—a two-sided conversation, with both parties having responsibilities in the 
interaction.”
Market research has helped to guide executive decisions over the years. Nowadays, however, 
market research is simply studying the equivalent of a mass audience without surfacing the 
nuances that deﬁ ne the audience with an audience of audiences.7 The study found that 75 
percent of CMOs use customer analytics to mine data, but only 42 percent study customer 
reviews and only 26 percent track blogs. What CMOs are largely missing is context and the 
ability to foster empathetic strategies and supporting protocol.
As we can clearly see, CMOs are missing the ability to extract and introduce a truly human 
touch, focusing on markets rather than individuals.8

171
INNOVATE OR DIE
If you take a look at the graph above, it’s these traditional metrics that drive increasingly 
ineffective decisions at a time when those very decisions are starting to also work against the 
company.9 Customer analytics is at least in the fourth spot, but as you can see, it isn’t until we 
get down to the 50 percent mark that personal data factors into strategic decisions. And even 
today, blogs are just a mere 26 percent.

172
CHAPTER 15
CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT IS NOT 
THE SAME AS CONVERSATIONS
Remember, at the top of the list of priorities of CEOs is getting closer to customers. Yet, looking 
at this information, it’s clear that the customer and the idea of the true picture of customers are 
contrasting. To truly engage, businesses must not only understand customers, but also act. It 
really is a play on the old saying, “actions speak louder than words.” But here, actions speak as 
loudly as words and, therefore, anything social requires social action.
When I was writing The End of Business as Usual, I sought out a working deﬁ nition of the word 
engagement. It was both unbelievable and also understandable that the results were varied and 
confusing. I proposed a working deﬁ nition in the manuscript that explained engagement as the 
act of a consumer and an organization or brand interacting within the consumer’s network of 
relevance. Engagement, and here’s the important part, is then measured by the takeaway value, 
sentiment, and resulting actions following the interaction. This is the experience.
With this deﬁ nition in mind, we zero 
in on the discrepancy between how 
businesses view the customer and how 
they measure engagement.
According to the IBM CMO study, 
CMOs (Chief Marketing Ofﬁ cers) 
reveal that data is focused on 
managing the customer transaction 
and not the relationship. This is not 
engagement. And, this is why I believe 
that any discussion about sCRM (social 
customer relationship management) 
[ 
]

173
INNOVATE OR DIE
is premature at best. As the following data demonstrates, companies are still placing greater 
emphasis on the “M” and not the “R” or relationship.
Yes, this is the end of business as usual and rather than merely focus on the transaction, 
businesses must focus on creating a meaningful and shareable customer experience ﬁ rst. In the 
preceding chart, we can see that awareness/education, interest/desire, use/enjoy, and bond/
advocate make the list. And, the direct beneﬁ ciary of those initiatives is the customer.
Engagement is not just about communication. It’s about creating experiences that mean 
something, something that’s positive and worth sharing. And, that is what’s possible today. In 
fact, if we look beyond transactions and measure results as they deﬁ ne and drive experiences, 
we can expand our toolbox to include what I refer to as the A.R.T. of Engagement. How can we 
best use our customers’ networks or services of relevance to inspire or spark actions, reactions, 
and transactions? How can we shape experiences and outcomes?
Nick Barton, vice president of sales and marketing, Greater China, InterContinental Hotel Group 
shared his brief but potent thoughts on the subject in IBM’s report. “We have to get scientiﬁ c 
about the customer experience.”

174
CHAPTER 15
IBM found that at the top of the list is the now infamous quest for what seems like seeking the 
holy grail without a map, return on investment (ROI).10 But there’s hope, as customer experience 
is second on the list. Truly, with the customer experience deﬁ ned from beginning to end, the 
other metrics fall into place.
Actions speak as loudly as words and as CMOs focus their priorities for shifts toward disruptive 
technology, the customer is at the front and center of corporate transformation.
Everything comes down to customer relationships and experiences and that’s what will separate 
your strategies from tomorrow’s success stories. To that end, at the top of the list is enhancing 
customer loyalty and advocacy. Following is designing experiences for tablets and mobile 
devices. Third, CMOs will use social media as a key engagement (hopefully as deﬁ ned earlier) 
channel. Now we’re talking! As you can see below, those companies that focus on customer-
focused and business outcomes perform well.

175
INNOVATE OR DIE
IBM found that CMOs who use customer data to improve customer experiences are actually 
outperforming those businesses that do not invest additional effort in fostering customer 
relationships. This is the chart that should bring it home for you. This is what you’re ﬁ ghting for. 
This is data to savor as it demonstrates the end of business as usual and the beginning of a new 
era of relevance. You are the change agent and your organization, your team, your peers, need 
you now more than ever.

176
CHAPTER 15
TEN PRIORITIES FOR MEANINGFUL 
BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION
Surviving Digital Darwinism is only part of the story. From the IBM CMO study, we learned that 
it takes customer-centricity and the ability to prioritize investments. But, more importantly, it 
takes leadership and it takes courage to do and see what others won’t or can’t. The future of 
business and customer and employee engagement is built on a foundation of vision, trust, 
signiﬁ cance, and relationships. Set on this foundation are 10 pillars on which your business 
transformation is predicated.
[ 
]
Strategy: With new media & 
technology creating a groundswell of
customer empowerment, new 
strategies must focus on alignment,
objectives & meaningful experiences 
& outcomes.   
People: The 5th P of the marketing 
mix, People, will take center stage as
organizations empower employees to
experiment through intrapreneurialsim
& partner with customers to advance
products, services & processes.    
Localization: For global 
organizations hoping to connect with
customers around the world,
localization & contextualization are
king in any engagement strategy.   
Intelligence: Social media is 
introducing the art & science of
listening & monitoring to
marketing/service teams.
Organizations need to invest in
technology, teams & processes to 
learn & feed insights.    
Vision: The stated outlook of 
organizational direction needs review.
In a time when brands are co-created,
if vision is unclear or underwhelming,
alignment, community & camaraderie
are elusive.    
Philanthropic Capitalism:
Customers expect values to match
their own. A new era of CSR requires 
charitable & sustainable decisions as
part of everyday business where
customers become stakeholders.      
Leadership: As technology continues 
to evolve & permeate work & life, 
behavior, expectations & 
communication evolve. Someone 
must look ahead, see where we need
to go & lead the way to relevance.   
Innovation: Adapt or Die! The ability 
to recognize new opportunities,
disruptive technology & the capacity
to consider or develop new solutions,
responses & systems as a matter of
process & collaboration.       
Inﬂuence: Digital inﬂuence is 
becoming prominent, turning
everyday consumers into new
inﬂuentials. Organizations should ID &
engage to extend reach. Contributing
to networks will also earn inﬂuence.    
Culture: This is a time of change, 
which requires coalescence &
solidarity. Organizations need to 
focus on cultivating a culture of 
adaptation, customer & employee 
centricity & empowerment.     

177
INNOVATE OR DIE
These 10 principles serve as the framework for an adaptable business model where 
opportunities are readily assessed and innovation is regularly practiced. The reward is relevance, 
afﬁ nity, and advocacy. As Leon C. Megginson once said in paraphrasing Charles Darwin’s Origin 
of the Species, 
It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. 
It is the one that is most adaptable to change.
Vision: The stated outlook of organizational direction needs review. When’s the last time you 
read your company’s vision or mission statement? If you have read it recently, would you 
tweet it proudly? In a time when brands are not created, but instead co-created, if vision is 
unclear or underwhelming, alignment, community, and camaraderie will prove elusive.
Strategy: With new media and emerging technology creating a groundswell of customer 
empowerment, new strategies must focus on the alignment of objectives with meaningful 
experiences and outcomes. All too often, emerging technology is confused with disruptive 
technology, where it impacts how companies work or how customers behave. Far too much 
emphasis, budget, and time are placed in new media channels without an understanding of 
why or what it is that customers expect or appreciate.
Culture: This is a time of change, which requires coalescence and solidarity. We can’t change 
whether the culture is rigid or risk averse. We can’t innovate if those who experiment are 
not supported. Organizations need to focus on cultivating a culture of adaptation rooted 
in customer- and employee-centricity and, more importantly, empowerment. Culture is 
everything. It is and should be intentional. It should be designed. Those companies that 
invest in the development of an adaptive culture will realize improved relationships that 
contribute to competitive advantages.
People: The ﬁ fth P of the marketing mix, “People,” will take center stage. Organizations that 
embrace the spirit of intrepreneurialism will empower employees to experiment through 
failure and success to improve engagement and morale. And, by embracing customers, 
insights will inspire relevant products, services, and processes. I’ll also add one more that 
aligns vision with people. The sixth P of marketing is “Purpose.” Aspiring to a higher 
“
”

178
CHAPTER 15
purpose is what separates mediocrity from performance and relevance. And, purpose is a 
pillar of experience.
Innovation: The ability to recognize new opportunities is perhaps the greatest challenge rivaled 
only by the ability to execute. Emerging and disruptive technology is now part of the 
business landscape and customer lifestyle. Innovation, trends, and hype are not going to 
stop. In fact, they will only amplify. The capacity to identify and consider new solutions and 
responses is critical. It must be supported by innovative collaboration and decision-making 
processes and systems to assess and react. Innovation must be perpetual.
Inﬂ uence: Digital inﬂ uence is becoming prominent in social networks, turning everyday 
consumers into new inﬂ uentials. As a result, a new customer hierarchy is developing that 
forces businesses to identify and engage those who rank higher than others. There is no 
future in any business model that is cemented in reactive engagement. Organizations 
should identify and engage all connected customers to extend reach outside of problems. 
Businesses must engage when touch points emerge, during decision-making cycles, 
when positive experiences are shared, or to proactively feed the results of those who are 
searching for insight and direction. Contributing value to people and investing time and 
energy into networks of relevance will earn any organization a position of equal or greater 
inﬂ uence.
Localization: For global organizations hoping to connect with customers around the world, 
localization and contextualization are king in any engagement strategy. This is also true 
for any engagement strategy regardless of locale. Many companies are jumping on every 
bandwagon imaginable, syndicating content, thinning resources, and investing no more 
in each network than what’s necessary to maintain a pulse. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, 
YouTube, Foursquare, Instagram, Pinterest, and Quora become broadcast channels for 
one-to-many strategies and programs that do very little for cultivating dedicated and 
engaged communities.
Intelligence: One of the biggest trends in 2011 was the development of social media command 
centers. At the heart of these sophisticated data-gathering silos were conversations and 
tools that allowed community managers to listen, respond, and promote engagement 

179
INNOVATE OR DIE
within the company. While social media is introducing the art and science of monitoring to 
marketing and service teams, it is the organizations that invest in technology, teams, and 
processes that will translate activity into actionable insights.
Philanthropic Capitalism: Customers expect values to match their own core values. What used 
to be a necessary checklist of community focus, such as corporate social responsibility 
or CSR, is now rebooted. Philanthropic capitalism is a business model where companies 
contribute to worthwhile causes on behalf of customers as part of the transaction. 
Additionally, customers are expressing that they will also invest in companies where 
employees are “treated well,” pledging trust and loyalty as a result. The empathetic 
business model on the horizon requires charitable and sustainable decisions as part of 
everyday business where customers naturally become stakeholders.

180
CHAPTER 15
DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY 
AND HOW TO COMPETE 
FOR THE FUTURE
Although disruptive technology is the bearer of tremendous opportunity, it is equally a 
harbinger of obsolescence. Technology’s impact on society and business is substantial. As 
technology continues to become part of everyday life, it becomes a continuous disruptive cycle 
that forever evolves how people communicate, work, and connect.
Keeping up requires a perpetual investment as innovation is constant and it’s only increasing. 
We are becoming a culture rife with ingenuity. Entrepreneurialism is contagious. The start-up 
way, or the “hacker life” as lived and breathed by Facebook, is introducing new mind-sets and 
models and it’s inspiring all who taste it to code, design, build, invest, and take risks.11 And this 
is just the beginning. Innovation is a global movement and it’s gaining momentum.
This is a time to take a step back, recognize where we are and where we need to be, examine 
our strategies and current initiatives, review our investments and opportunities, and consider 
new areas for change or new pursuits.
The truth is that innovation works for us and against us. Investing in it with purpose and design 
is our responsibility. Whether you’re an entrepreneur leading the latest or the next hot start-up, 
a business executive seeking solutions or a competitive edge, a decision maker or a champion 
for change in any industry, this is the time to see through the chaos of features, trends, IPOs, 
investments, ballooning valuations, and so on, to clear a path for meaningful progress.
Part of the challenge is knowing when to recognize opportunities. Although it’s easy to get 
caught up in the hype, there is a gap that exists between current needs, evolving pains, and the 
myriad of solutions hitting desktops, smart phones, tablets, and digital appliances every day. 
The problem is that many organizations aren’t designed to be adaptive. They’re designed to 
optimize efﬁ ciencies and processes. But, times have changed and disruptive technology isn’t as 
[ 
]

181
INNOVATE OR DIE
easy to recognize nor capitalize on without a greater mission and purpose or an infrastructure to 
identify trends, experiment, learn, and scale.
Competing for the future requires a full assessment of how some of the biggest trends in 
technology impact your business or markets today and how they will inﬂ uence behavior in 
the future. While this list may alter, expand, or contract based on your industry, the image 
below should provide a glimpse of just how expansive the landscape is, and while not every 
technology is affecting the bottom line today, elements are beginning to change the way 
decisions are made and how people work with one another. At the very least, the golden 
triangle of cloud, mobile, and social provides a hub to begin the evaluation of both technology 
and human behavior.

182
CHAPTER 15
To chart a new course toward relevance, here are ﬁ ve initial steps to 
consider: 
1 
Assume that there is a surplus of confusion among users and decision makers within 
organizations and customers on which technology is trending versus technology that 
is showing signs of becoming or already is disruptive. Discovering the difference and 
prioritizing what’s important is critical.
2 
Understand that the roles of the CMO and CIO (Chief Information Ofﬁ cer) are becoming 
closer than ever before. With marketing investing a signiﬁ cant percentage of the overall 
technology budget now and over time, the “I” in CIO may need to represent innovation to 
help lead more informed decisions from the inside.
3 
Task an existing organization, external partner, or develop a new task force to evaluate 
technology to improve the infrastructure of how your business works; cultivate 
relationships with customers, employees, and stakeholders; design better products and 
services, and demonstrate competitive advantages.
4 
Deploy this team to measure technology against a myriad of factors that are important 
to your business and assess which technologies are worthy of implementation, ﬁ nancial 
investment, acquisition, or experimentation.
5 
Realign the team against a renewed vision and purpose and train employees to use 
these technologies to achieve desired objectives at the enterprise, LoB (line of business), 
and functional levels . . . to meet customer and employee expectations and steer 
delightful experiences.12
These are the times when getting caught up in technology, value, and new technology is often 
mistaken for innovation that inﬂ ates the dreaded bubble. What we don’t need is to invest in 
the wrong technologies simply because posts are constantly written with the “top 10” ways to 
grow our business with said platform. While we can watch them grow, the real focus should be 
on the development of a formal system that measures impact and prioritizes resources around it 
accordingly.

183
INNOVATE OR DIE
Building a process for disruptive technology sets the stage for a culture of innovation and 
adaptation. Customers aren’t the only passengers on the dynamic journey. As the change 
agent for your organization, as the hero, you will lead your organization on its own journey of 
transformation. And in doing so, you will help your business earn relevance now and in the 
future where success is measured in revenue, proﬁ tability, relationships, and shared experiences.

THE DILEMMA’S INNOVATOR

Art begins in

in innovation.
—Mason Cooley

187
THE DILEMMA’S INNOVATOR
In a time when only one in ﬁ ve U.S. adults does not use the Internet, it takes an astute 
command of the obvious to see that society is becoming increasingly digital and connected.1 
As a result of this profound connectedness, a gap is already forming between people and your 
business. A gap is also manifesting between consumer expectations and the products and 
services you offer.
The simple truth is that it takes a culture of innovation to compete for both Generation C and 
for the future . . . and that’s where you come in. You are the hero in this journey, and the change 
you lead starting with evolving customer engagement and deﬁ ning experiences will have a great 
effect within your business. One of the greatest opportunities before you is materialized through 
the evolution in connected consumerism. How your organization is designed and structured today 
will one day work against you if organization transformation is on your agenda. As you more than 
well know, management, processes, systems, and rewards are constructed to improve what “is” 
today and not what “will be” or “should be.” To innovate ﬁ rst requires innovation within.

188
CHAPTER 16
INNOVATION IS BLINDNESS: WHY 
INNOVATION IS FUNDAMENTAL TO 
THE SURVIVAL OF TOMORROW’S 
BUSINESS . . . TODAY
In the book The Innovator’s Dilemma, Clayton Christensen introduced the term Disruptive 
Innovation to demonstrate how and why successful businesses failed. Christensen looked at 
many companies including Sears, DEC, and Xerox. These companies were once celebrated for 
business, management, and market leadership, only to become symbols of corporate laggards 
and examples of what could happen without transformation. While his initial hypothesis was 
that each of the companies had in one way or another stopped competing and innovating, 
he in fact learned the opposite. The culture and supporting structure of each company shared 
commonsensical and seemingly smart tenets: 
• Each company possessed great management teams.
• They listened to customers.
• Improved products and services.
• Invested in R&D while focusing on proﬁ ts.
• Pioneered innovation.
• Sought to grow revenues and market share.
Yet these companies lost their once prestigious edge simply because they did the right things 
over and over. While they focused on running what they knew, they missed what they didn’t 
know. Sounds paradoxical, I know. The trends that literally disrupted and continue to disrupt 
markets result from shifts in behavior, expectations, new business models, and left-ﬁ eld 
products and services that either contributed to or serendipitously aligned with these shifts.
[ 
]

189
THE DILEMMA’S INNOVATOR
Businesses that thrust the Sears, DECs, and Xeroxes of the world into complacency or 
borderline irrelevance, championed Christensen’s Disruptive Innovation simply by doing 
business. Either intentionally or unknowingly, emerging competitors pursued unusual or even 
counterintuitive business practices that garnered incredible traction.
First, Christensen found that products that possessed qualities for Disruptive Innovation weren’t 
good enough for existing customers. Established companies listened to customers and to 
appease them, delivered more of what they wanted.
Once a product becomes mainstream, it is at risk of becoming a commodity. Once 
commoditized, proﬁ ts dwindle and as a result, supporting processes automate and optimize to 
preserve margins.
For years, people asked for cheaper, smaller laptops and that’s just what they got. 
Unfortunately, they also got what they paid for. In the meantime, Apple introduced stylish, more 
expensive, intuitive, and often heavier/larger laptops to those who never knew they needed a 
new computing experience.
Second, Christensen learned that there is no proﬁ table market for products that carry the 
Disruptive Innovation banner. Markets for the “next big thing” would already be the “current 
big thing.” Companies that focus on research and development tend to look at innovation 
through a lens of sustained progress and not necessarily the introduction of new products, 
processes, or revolutions in direction or the way people work.
Apple’s iPhone and iPad lines continue to prove that there is indeed a market for the next big 
thing. In Q4 2011, Apple sold more iPads than any other PC manufacturer sold PC devices. 
As the company focuses on improving existing product lines, it continues to look at its next 
opportunity for disruption. Many believe Apple’s future product will completely disrupt the 
television industry.
Third, Disruptive Innovation represents a shift in value. The aim for potentially disruptive 
products or services will not make money through conventional means. Instead, new business 
models will emerge to support new solutions. For example, hard drive manufacturers pursue 
sustained innovation in making drives that are smaller, faster, and hold greater volumes of data. 
In the case of the laptop and portable market, for example, innovation in hard drives shifted 
from moving parts to solid state to make room for smaller footprint devices. In the case of 

190
CHAPTER 16
Google’s Chromebook, for example, its onboard storage is minimal. Instead, all storage for apps 
and data is stored in the cloud and thus the need for laptop drives is now minimal while still 
delivering a productive experience for its users. The new opportunity for drive manufacturers is 
providing the capacity to support the cloud.
In the circle of life, connected consumerism is 
the new reality. Those businesses that don’t 
disrupt their own markets will ﬁ nd their 
markets disrupted for them.
Not all is lost, however. While Generation C is taking shape, you must look at how to innovate 
within to innovate outside. If Gen C’ers are your customers, they are also your employees. 
Now’s the time to form a special unit to start exploring needs, opportunities, expectations, and 
behavior to develop an action plan that doesn’t distract your focus, but instead invests in the 
alternative realities that are already taking shape.
In the end, complacency is a symptom of mediocrity and mediocrity is the result of a leadership 
organization that chooses not to lead, but instead, to manage how to be better or more 
efﬁ cient around “what is” and not “what should be” or “what’s next.”

191
THE DILEMMA’S INNOVATOR
IN THE BATTLE AGAINST 
RELEVANCE VERSUS IRRELEVANCE: 
IT’S SURVIVAL OF THE FITTING
The good news is that you’re not in this alone. Businesses are transforming and their examples 
can help you make the case within your organization. I’d like to share one example with you 
here. You’ve probably heard of Burberry. Established in 1856, this iconic fashion brand has 
effectively competed for relevance for more than 150 years. To do so takes constant innovation 
without losing your soul to compete for an evolving customer landscape that is undergoing the 
connected transformation we’ve spent so much time on throughout the book.
There are so many examples of companies that are transforming from the inside out. I chose 
Burberry because its complete transformation was and is inspired by the connected consumer. 
The company didn’t just try to design its way into the lives of Generation C; instead it saw the 
dynamic customer journey and each moment of truth as a revelation that the company could 
do better.
Certainly product design and overall experience design is part of what Harry Gold of 
Overrdrive Interactive calls the Brand Embrace.2 The term describes the sum total of all digital 
relationships that organizations can create with their prospects and customers. When I think 
about the idea of the Brand Embrace in the context of connected consumerism and the new 
era of experiences that they expect, I envision the Brand Embrace as the articulation of a 
vision for the desired relationship between brand and customer. This vision also conveys the 
experience a customer will have with the brand during each moment of truth. That to me is a 
true Brand Embrace.
Angela Ahrendts, Burberry3 CEO, captured this vision for the Brand Embrace so eloquently: 
“You have to be totally connected with everyone who touches your brand.”
[ 
]

192
CHAPTER 16
When I look at Burberry’s current endeavor, it is a series of innovations that involve not only 
product and customer experiences but also the behind-the-scenes investments in technology, 
processes, and policies. While it doesn’t sound as exciting as a fashion show in London or Paris, 
it is the type of investment that will keep the company on the runway for years to come.
If you think about it, this is as much about new consumerism and disruptive technology as it is 
about culture . . . fostering an internal culture that’s customer-centric, adaptive, and above all 
else, ready to tackle transformation.
Burberry, like so many other brands that “get it,” jumped into social and mobile media. As of 
September 2012, the iconic fashion brand boasted 14 million Likes on Facebook. But as this 
book set out to demonstrate, it will take more than a Facebook brand page or brand app to 
engage the connected customer and set forth incredible and shareable experiences. It takes 
transformation in philosophy, evolution in vision, and investment in infrastructure. In working 
with Salesforce, that’s just what Angela Ahrendts and creative director Christopher Bailey set 
out to accomplish.
It started with Burberry’s vision to not only stay relevant, but earn a signiﬁ cant brand embrace, 
one that would create a new world for the global fashion house.
Deﬁ ning the brand embrace is a critical step for deﬁ ning the experience. In a promotional 
video published by Salesforce, Ahrendts shared the importance of vision and transformation to 
bring the brand embrace to life. “We had a vision, to be the ﬁ rst company that was fully digital 
end-to-end. The experience would be that a customer has total access to Burberry, across any 
device, anywhere. They get exactly the same feeling of the brand and feeling of the culture, 
regardless of how, when and where they were accessing the brand. Everyone can come to 
Burberry World and understand the journey and mission that Burberry is on.”
It might seem like a risk for a luxury brand, one that some might say portrays a sense of 
exclusivity, but through an integrated approach guided by a united vision of innovation, 
evolution, tradition, and experience. In an article published in Fortune in June 2012,4 Maureen 
Mullen of tech think tank L2 observed, “What they’ve done, that no other organization in the 
fashion industry has done, is put a relentless focus on digital innovation.”
To bring a holistic experience to life, it would take the integration of the company, its 
employees, its customers, and the all-important brand. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff met with 
Ahrendts and Burberry CTO John Douglas in a New York hotel. Benioff sketched out “Burberry 
World” to visualize how integration will enable Ahrendts’ vision for an integrated customer 

193
THE DILEMMA’S INNOVATOR
experience across channels, devices, retail locations, and products and services. In an interview 
with Benioff at Cloudforce New York in 2011, Ahrendts answered an important question, “Why 
Burberry World?” Her answer was direct. While the company maintains important relationships 
with key constituencies and stakeholders across the board, 70 percent of the company’s 
workforce is under 30. And equally, many of its new customers and prospects also represent 
younger demographics. These digital natives communicate and connect different, and Ahrendts 
recognized this in her response to Why Burberry World: “This is typically where consumers 
would go.”
Burberry Heritage + Connected Customer + Vision for Brand Embrace + Culture + Technology 
 
= Burberry World.
What started as a crude but compelling drawing on a napkin ultimately became the blueprint 
for Burberry World, the company’s ambitious 18-month plan to unite technology, people, retail, 
products, and the overarching brand. If you look closely, you can see an integrated strategy 
that deﬁ nes and reinforces Burberry’s vision to deliver a holistic experience and a desired Brand 
Embrace.
In the CloudForce interview, Ahrendts positioned Burberry World as the front door where 
connected customers can move freely across screens and instores for a holistic and personalized 
experience. “Every screen has the ability to move and to interact exactly as you would anything 
in a store that would have human interaction.” Ahrendts continued, “It’s mobile ﬁ rst. It’s social 
ﬁ rst. It’s e-com ﬁ rst . . . I think it’s just ﬂ ipping the traditional business model totally upside 
down. It’s not about bricks and mortar. It’s a difference universe. There’s a different universal 
language being spoken. I think companies have to speak that language. You can’t ﬁ ght it. Your 
workforce, they speak that language, so the onus is on us to be a part of the social revolution.”
The foundation for Burberry World supports several pillars that reinforce Burberry’s plan to 
adapt the business from the inside out, traversing the back ofﬁ ce, customer engagement, retail, 
each moment of truth, and building an infrastructure to lead customers through an enriching 
dynamic customer journey.

194
CHAPTER 16
Together with Burberry, Salesforce envisioned the 12 Pillars of a Social 
Enterprise:
  1. Social Customer Proﬁ le
  2. Social and Digital Integration with Supply Chain Partners

The key is to ﬁ nd your pillars as they will support your vision for the brand embrace and the 
experience you wish to envelop your customers. Not every company has a leader such as 
Angela Ahrendts. You’ll need to lead the change, but you will require executive sponsorship. 
To do so, you’ll need to assemble an internal steering committee that’s representative of key 
functions throughout the organization to create a blueprint for transformation. The goal is to 
match your vision, the desired experience and brand embrace, the brand promise and pillars, 
and the corresponding technologies and philosophies it will take to enliven everything. If you 
are an executive, then change is well within your responsibility. This is your opportunity to lead, 
not just manage growth.
In closing, Ahrendts offered priceless advice with undertones of forewarning to any executive 
seeking to compete for relevance and compete for the future. “To any CEO who’s skeptical at 
all, you have . . . you have to create a social enterprise today. You have to be totally connected 
with everyone who touches your brand. If you don’t do that, I don’t know what your business 
model is in ﬁ ve years.”
Think digital.

THE HERO’S JOURNEY

Nobody can go 
back and start a 
new beginning, but 
anyone can start 
today and make a 
new ending.
—Maria Robinson

199
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
This book is dedicated to disruption, innovation, and transformation. As the real hero in this 
journey, this book is dedicated to you. My intention is to introduce you to your connected 
customers, demonstrate how they progress through a dynamic customer journey, and how they 
behave in each moment of truth. Part entitlement, part egotism, part DIY (do it yourself), and 
part entrepreneurialism, Generation C’ers’ behavior is indeed dissimilar to that of their more 
traditional counterparts.
Together we’ve learned that these consumers are far more informed, far more sophisticated in 
their decision making, and savvier in their digital prowess. They’re artistic and awe-inspiring in 
their capacity to effectively multitask across multiple devices and platforms. We have to adapt 
accordingly.
Now more than ever, though, leadership takes innovation and a vision for not only introducing 
something new, but also for something meaningful and experiential. To truly innovate, though, 
starts with something far simpler than transformation. Innovation starts with going back to 
basics to align vision and intentions with desirable outcomes and signiﬁ cant experiences—even 
if that means investing in the development of products and services that your customers don’t 
realize they want or need yet.

200
CHAPTER 17
Let’s recap the last 16 (yes, we’re counting zero) chapters for a moment: 
1 
Connected customers open up new touch points.
2 
How your connected customers inﬂ uence and are inﬂ uenced is nothing like how your 
traditional customers are.
3 
Their expectations are different and they align with you for different reasons than you 
think. Quality, how you treat employees and customers, and the sustainable footprint you 
leave on this planet are of uppermost importance to engagement.
4 
The channels they use may not ever cross other channels. They can be fully contained from 
beginning to end on one device in one network.
5 
Sometimes customers do hop channels and they expect a seamless and integrated 
experience. You need to bring these various groups together to design a seamless 
experience.
6 
The one thing that your connected customers value above all is feeling valued. We need a 
new way to express value and measure it.
7 
To connect with connected customers takes (a) an understanding of their behavior and 
preferences; (b) the ability to read between the lines and innovate in products and 
services; (c) the deﬁ nition of a vision for what customer experiences will look like in every 
moment of truth and throughout the dynamic customer journey; and (d) a blueprint for 
transforming the inside of the organization through philosophy and technology to lead a 
new era of integrated customer experiences and engagement.
To change takes two things: the aspiration 
and determination to change.

201
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
It starts with vision.
Chances are that your organization is already exploring new media, technology, and alternative 
channels for customer engagement. To start with vision is a seemingly trivial step, but its role 
sets the stage for meaningful business transformation. Someone needs to press PAUSE to stop 
the chaotic rush toward modernization and ask, “Why are we doing this?” Without doing so, 
businesses are only perpetuating the problem as it exists today.
In 1937, Henry Ford was quoted in Dale Carnegie’s best-selling book, How to Win Friends and 
Inﬂ uence People. “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other 
person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
That’s what this book is about . . . getting perspective in order to ﬁ nd clarity and meaning in 
your vision.

202
CHAPTER 17
THE TASK FORCE, 
AKA STEERING 
COMMITTEE
It sounds like a special forces unit or a new comic book series by Marvel Comics, but instead 
this is your team. This is the group that you will assemble to help you begin the process of 
transformation to bring your vision for customer experiences and engagement to life.
[ 
]

203
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
You may already have several efforts underway internally. Disruptive technology is just that—it’s 
disruptive. Your experiential work is one of many ways your organization is getting rocked by 
evolution. But here, your focus is on experience, engagement, and outcomes. This will not only 
affect your work, but also the work of others.
For example, many organizations are investing in the development of a center of excellence 
for social media, digital, customer service, listening and intelligence, and collaboration. Your 
work spans these groups and unites them. Bringing them together around a sweeping digital 
or experience initiative will unite disparate teams and also disparate outcomes. Your customers 
don’t see different departments or functions; they see one brand. The mission you’re embarking 
on—the Hero’s Journey—brings together a team that can take responsibility for not only 
deﬁ ning, but realizing the holistic customer experience.
Depending on the structure of your business, your task force size and shape 
will vary. For larger enterprises, your team may include representatives from: 
1. IT
2. Digital
3. UX
4. LoBs/brands
5. Legal
6. HR
7. R&D
 8. Sales and marketing
 9. PR/corporate communications/
public affairs
10. Finance
11. Research
12. Service and support
The goal of the task force is to set forth the governance and lead the charter for deﬁ ning the 
customer experience. These distinct groups are included because in their own way each affects 
the customer experience. The difference is that today, the experience is disjointed as each 
group operates independently. For an integrated experience, think Burberry World. It takes 
these groups to work together to deﬁ ne a common vision and an accord to push forward in a 
common direction.

204
CHAPTER 17
Some of the areas of responsibility for the task force include:
• Lead dynamic customer journey (DCJ) and moment of truth (MOT) research efforts to learn
• Deﬁ ne the customer journey in each moment
• Design customer experiences and outcomes at every stage
• Internal stakeholder engagement to surfaces, internal opportunities, and challenges
• Champion digital strategies and the overall customer experience throughout the 
organization
• Develop governance model, processes, materials, and training program
• Draft experience playbook
• Draft digital engagement playbook (MOTs and DCJ)
• Provide insight on program needs based on the stakeholders they represent
• Standardize strategy development, project approvals, and success metrics
• Create checklist for businesses to review in determining prioritization for digital support
• Present progress to executive sponsors
• Prioritize, run, and measure pilots, organizations, and key stakeholders
The key here is executive sponsorship. You must enlist a connected executive, if not the 
executive, to stand behind your effort. Doing so eliminates typical barriers and also champions 
the movement throughout the organization. It also expedites the process and opens the door to 
critical, previously unattainable resources.

205
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
THE STAGES OF CHANGE
Change is inevitable. At the same time change is daunting. Undertaking it is certainly rife with 
obstacles. But, merely recognizing the need to change is often the most difﬁ cult milestone to 
reach.
In the late 1970s, James Prochaska and Carlo DiClemente of the University of Rhode Island 
developed the Transtheoretical Model1 of Behavior Change. The goal was to assess an 
individual’s readiness to shed bad habits and to act on new, healthier behavior. The model 
provided strategies and processes to guide individuals through each stage to achieve and 
manage their goals. The stages describe a person’s motivational readiness or progress toward 
modifying behavior.
In the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), the addressed behavior was typically problematic and 
the process was designed to break those bad habits. I include it here because it has its merits 
for organizational transformation. If nothing else, it helps provide you with the basis for a 
framework to chart a path forward with notable milestones and hurdles.
Prior to the TTM model, behavior change was viewed as an event, such as quitting smoking, 
drinking, or overeating. It’s the equivalent of saying “Let’s change.” Prochaska’s and 
DiClemente’s model suggests that change is a process involving ﬁ ve distinct stages (sourced 
from “The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change,” Science of Health Promotion 12, 
no. 1 [September/October, 1997]):2
1 
Precontemplation (Not Ready): The stage in which people are not intending to take 
action in the foreseeable future, usually measured as the next six months. People may be 
in this stage because they are uninformed or underinformed about the consequences of 
their behavior. Or they may have tried to change a number of times and have become 
demoralized about their ability to change.
[ 
]

206
CHAPTER 17
2 
Contemplation (Getting Ready): The stage in which people are intending to change in 
the next six months. They are more aware of the pros of changing but are also acutely 
aware of the cons. This balance between the costs and beneﬁ ts of changing can produce 
profound ambivalence that can keep people stuck in this stage for long periods of time.
3 
Preparation (Ready): The stage in which people are intending to take action in the 
immediate future, usually measured as the next month. They have typically taken some 
signiﬁ cant action in the past year. These individuals have a plan of action.
4 
Action (Action): The stage in which people have made speciﬁ c overt modiﬁ cations within 
the past six months. The action stage is also the stage where vigilance against relapse is 
critical.
5 
Maintenance (Maintenance): The stage in which people are working to prevent relapse 
but they do not apply change processes as frequently as do people in action. They are less 
tempted to relapse and increasingly more conﬁ dent that they can continue their change.

207
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
Understanding the stages of change is helpful in constructing our plan for transformation. But 
a key question emerges that without an answer may stall the process before it gets any notable 
traction. “How do people move from one stage to another?”
In the TTM, efﬁ cacy is driven by the individual. In your work, change will have to be pushed by 
you and your task force. Think of yourself as the sponsor for change, someone who shepherds 
the process. For without you, those individuals and also the systems and processes that need 
to change will either relapse or abandon the effort. Self-efﬁ cacy won’t apply wholeheartedly. 
People will need a different push in each stage to help them progress. With that said, learn from 
the following elements to ensure productive progress:
• Ensure the appropriate Decision Balance: A growing awareness that the advantages (the 
pros) of changing outweigh the disadvantages (the cons).
• Instill conﬁ dence that they can make and maintain changes in situations that tempt them to 
return to their old, unhealthy behavior.
• Put in place strategies that can help them make and maintain change. In the TTM model, 
the 10 Processes of Change include:
1. Consciousness raising—Increasing awareness via information, case studies, proof 
points, and feedback.
2. Dramatic relief—Feeling fear, anxiety, or worry because of the existing behavior, or 
feeling inspiration and hope when hearing about how others are able to change.
3. Self-reevaluation—Realizing that change is an important part of who they are and 
want to be.
4. Environmental reevaluation—Realizing how existing behavior affects others and how 
change could lead to positive effects.
5. Self-liberation—Believing that one can change and the commitment and 
recommitment to act on that belief.
6. Social liberation—Realizing that society is more supportive of change (in this case 
your customers and employees).

208
CHAPTER 17
7.  Helping relationships—Finding people who are supportive of change.
8.   Counterconditioning—Learning about and practicing more productive behaviors to 
substitute the current behavior.
9.   Reinforcement management—Increasing the rewards that come from positive 
behavior and reducing those that come from negative behavior. In the original 
journal, this was referred to as contingency management, which provides 
consequences for taking steps in a particular direction.
10.    Helping relationships—Combining caring, trust, openness, and acceptance as well 
as support for productive behavior change.

THE HERO’S JOURNEY
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
Before we take these next steps, let’s revisit Chapter 2 for a moment and reacquaint ourselves 
with the Hero’s Journey. We originally reviewed the Hero’s Journey in the context of storytelling 
and how your customer is really at the center of the experience you’re trying to create. In our 
closing chapter, let’s use the Hero’s Journey to think through the cycle of change that faces your 
organization. The key difference is that here, you are the hero and this is your journey. As the 
change agent, let’s merge the TTM with the Hero’s Journey to prepare you for what change will 
look like within your organization. Here, you are the hero.

Here you experience Total Recall. You question why? You start to see the need for change. Your 
initial work is focused but not yet transformational. You feel as if more can be done. But then 
you’re not sure it’s your responsibility or within your realm to push forward. Or perhaps the 
opportunity is bigger than you originally envisioned. You question your calling. Perhaps you 
even refuse it. But that’s when you meet someone or others like you who will empower 
you . . . stand by you through the need for change. This can and should include an executive 
sponsor and the task force we reviewed at the end of Chapter 15.

211
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
STAGE 2: TRIBULATION
[ 
]
Change is met with hardship. It’s unavoidable. In this stage you start to feel the discomfort 
associated with leaving your comfort zone. But you’re already underway. You must ﬁ nd a new 
comfort zone. As you begin the transformation process with your task force you will meet many 
obstacles. They’ll arise in the form of resource and budget constraints, politics, skepticism, 
tunnel vision, and blatant ignorance. Stay true. Stay focused. Your mission serves a higher 
purpose and your connected customers (and employees) are anxious for you to succeed.

As the task force does its job, part of the tangential beneﬁ ts include the buzz and excitement 
that permeates the halls of your business. Once your connected employees hear about what 
you’re working on and what you’re trying to do, they start to inquire about how they can be 
part of it or how soon they’ll see the fruits of your efforts. This contributes to the consensus 
among your peers and also among decision makers.
To hold consensus takes frameworks and processes. This stage is dedicated to governance and 
the deﬁ nition of how the organization will and will not transform. This work sets the stage for 
how people, teams, philosophies, and technology strategies will support the transformation.
It’s always darkest before the dawn of transformation. There will be pushback. There will be 
more and more challenges and tasks that emerge along the way. Change is perpetual. This is 
where the greatest risk for a relapse exists. You must keep the team strong to prevent anyone 
from giving up. You’ve come too far for that.

213
THE HERO’S JOURNEY
STAGE 4: REALIZATION
[ 
]
To call this the last stage would be a bit misleading. In the face of disruptive technology, 
transformation is continual. It becomes part of your business model. In this phase the team 
moves beyond the deﬁ nition of governance to a stage of learning. In many cases I’ve studied, 
businesses develop all supporting processes and systems models around speciﬁ c pilot 
programs. This keeps the process of change focused. More importantly, it keeps the process 
of change focused on learning. Here you learn and adapt accordingly. As you do, you lift your 
head and notice that the people inside and outside of the organization are noticing the change 
you’ve worked so diligently to realize. That, in and of itself, is rewarding to you. But, change is 
now constant. Take this moment to revel in your journey. Since you are the hero in this story, 
your journey is only beginning.

THANK YOU
The result is a new organizational philosophy playbook to support it. This is a playbook for 
business transformation and the processes that support the experience—the integrated 
experience, relationships, and the outcomes you’ve designed.
And thus the Hero’s Journey, your journey, begins. You and I have spent a short while 
together, but the lessons learned together will have a lasting impact on your career and your 
organization. There’s much to do. From Monomyths to Total Recall to MOTs to Generation C to 
the dynamic customer journeys, we walk away from this experience focused on the experience. 
This isn’t an easy task. You will face a great but rewarding road ahead. But you are not alone 
in this endeavor. Legions of connected customers and employees are waiting for you to make 
the move they’ve hoped for or called for. Change is in the air and thankfully it is not change for 
the sake of change, but instead change for the opportunity to earn and re-earn relevance and 
leadership. This is your calling. This is your journey. This is your time.

THIS IS NOT THE END
When I get to the end of a book, I ﬁ nd myself gratiﬁ ed that I ﬁ nished it. But, I also feel a pleasant 
sense of sorrow as I’m not always ready for the journey to end. Well, it doesn’t end here. As a 
special thank you, I’ve written a bonus chapter that you can download for free right now: www

The chapter focuses on a key aspect of the formula: business + design = intended experiences. 
Measurement is everything. And, often how we measure results has more to do with 
satisfaction, sentiment, conversions and others sales, marketing, and service related numbers. 
What if we measured shared experiences instead of or in addition to what we do today?
