Acknowledgments
This book is a collaborative effort involving many more people than those listed on the cover. 
Personally, I would like to thank my family, whose patience and understanding made this, and 
all other pursuits, possible. Professionally, I would like to thank the co-workers, clients, custom-
ers, and friends whose input and ideas have helped build the knowledge and experience that I 
draw from in applying concept to practice.
I would like to thank Lucas Larue for the outstanding work he performed as technical editor 
as well as the many tips and tricks he’s contributed to this book as well as my overall knowledge 
of Autodesk® Inventor® software. A special thank-you goes out to those who have contributed 
content to the Mastering Inventor series in the past: Thom Tremblay, Sean Dotson, Bill Bogan, 
Andrew Faix, Seth Hindman, Loren Jahraus, Shekar Subrahmanyam, Bob Van der Donck, and 
the late Dennis Jeffrey, all of whom are true masters of Autodesk Inventor.
Thank you to the team at Wiley— Alexa Murphy, Dassi Zeidel, Kim Wimpsett, Connor 
O’Brien, and Pete Gaughan—for their patience, focus, and professionalism, without which 
there would be no book. Your hard work and support always ease the effort of turning ideas

Introduction
The Autodesk® Inventor® program was introduced in 1999 as an ambitious 3D parametric mod-
eler based not on the familiar Autodesk® AutoCAD® software programming architecture but 
instead on a separate foundation that would provide the room needed to grow into the fully 
featured modeler it is now, more than a decade later. Autodesk Inventor 2015 continues the 
development of Autodesk Inventor with improved modeling, drawing, assembly, and visual-
ization tools. Autodesk has set out to improve this release of Autodesk Inventor by devoting as 
much time and energy to improving existing tools and features as it has to adding new ones.
With this book, the sixth edition of Mastering Autodesk® Inventor® 2015 and Autodesk® Inventor 
LT™ 2015, I have set out to update the existing pages and add new content and exercises. In 
these pages, you will fi nd detailed information on the specifi cs of the tools and the principles of 
sound parametric design techniques. Some readers will fi nd this book works best for them as a 
desktop reference, whereas others will use it primarily for the step-by-step tutorials. With this in 
mind, I’ve worked to shape the pages of this book with a mix of reference material, instructional 
steps, and tips and hints from the real world.
Who Should Read Th is Book
This book is written with a wide range of Autodesk Inventor users in mind, varying from begin-
ner to advanced users and Autodesk Inventor instructors:
 
◆
Beginner Autodesk Inventor users who are making the move from traditional 2D CAD 
design to Autodesk Inventor 2015. These readers might have experience with AutoCAD 
and will possess an understanding of basic design and engineering concepts as well as a 
desire to improve their skill set and stay competitive in the marketplace.
 
◆
Intermediate Autodesk Inventor users who are self-taught or have gone through formal 
Autodesk Inventor training during their company’s initial implementation of Autodesk 
Inventor and who are looking for more information on a specifi c module within Autodesk 
Inventor. This book also targets users looking for a desktop reference to turn to when they 
come upon an area of Autodesk Inventor they do not encounter on a day-to-day basis.
 
◆
Advanced Autodesk Inventor users who have mastered the Autodesk Inventor tools used 
over and over daily but want to conquer the parts of the program they do not utilize during 
their normal design tasks. This book also targets advanced users who want to add to their 
skill set to move up the ranks within their current company or want to expand their knowl-
edge in pursuit of a new position with another employer.

XXVIII | INTRODUCTION
 
◆
Autodesk Inventor users of any skill and experience level who are preparing for the 
Autodesk Inventor Associate or Professional exam.
 
◆
CAD and engineering instructors looking for a text to use in instructor-led classroom 
training.
Attempting to learn all the tools in Autodesk Inventor can be an intimidating experience 
because of the wide range of task-specifi c modules available. It is the goal of this book to sepa-
rate these modules into easy-to-tackle chapters relating to real-world situations for which the 
tools were designed while also including chapters on general Autodesk Inventor tools, tech-
niques, and design principles.
What You Will Learn
The following pages will explain the Autodesk Inventor settings while teaching you how each 
tool functions. Just as importantly, though, these pages are fi lled with the tips and techniques 
learned by the experts who spent years using, researching, and discussing the tools in Autodesk 
Inventor. You should come away from reading this book with a solid understanding of the capa-
bilities of Autodesk Inventor and a strong idea of how to tackle your design challenges in the 
future, as well as an abundance of time-saving tips and tricks.
What You Will Need
The fi les needed to complete the tutorial projects in this book can be downloaded from the 
Sybex website at the following location:
www.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015
Download the collection of zip fi les and extract all the fi les to a folder on your computer, such 
as \My Documents\Mastering Inventor 2015. In this folder you will have a subdirec-
tory for each of the 20 chapters, plus a couple of other folders, as well as a fi le called Mastering 
Inventor 2015.ipj, as shown here:
Once the fi les are in place, set the Mastering Inventor 2015 project as the active project by fol-
lowing these steps. Note that if you are using Autodesk Inventor LT, the use of project fi les does 
not apply, and you can skip these steps:

Free Autodesk Software for Students and Educators
Th e Autodesk Education Community is an online resource with more than ﬁ ve million members that 
enables educators and students to download—for free (see website for terms and conditions)—the 
same software used by professionals worldwide. You can also access additional tools and materi-
als to help you design, visualize, and simulate ideas. Connect with other learners to stay current 
with the latest industry trends and get the most out of your designs. Get started today at www
.autodesk.com/joinedu.
To install and run Autodesk Inventor, you should consult the system requirements informa-
tion on the installation media and ensure that you have a system capable of running Autodesk 
Inventor adequately. For basic educational purposes, dealing with small tutorial-sized assem-
blies, Autodesk recommends a minimum of 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of available hard disk space 
to accommodate the installation fi les and temporary fi les created during the installation. Note 
that these are the minimum requirements to install and run the program, and you might see 
slow performance when executing operations that require heavy calculations.
I recommend a system with a minimum of 6 GB of RAM for doing production work on 
moderate-sized assemblies and encourage you to consider an appropriate workstation for 
undertaking large assembly design.
Th e Mastering Series
The Mastering series from Sybex provides outstanding instruction for readers with intermediate 
and advanced skills in the form of top-notch training and development for those already work-
ing in their fi eld, as well as clear, serious education for those aspiring to become pros. Every 
Mastering book includes the following:
 
◆
Real-world scenarios, ranging from case studies to interviews, that show how the tool, 
technique, or knowledge presented is applied in actual practice
 
◆
Skill-based instruction, with chapters organized around real tasks rather than abstract 
concepts or subjects
 
◆

Autodesk Inventor LT, Autodesk Inventor, and Autodesk 
Inventor Professional
The Autodesk Inventor mechanical CAD software is available in three primary product con-
fi gurations that offer specifi c levels of functionality to fi t the needs of different users. This 
book contains information that relates to all three of these versions of the Autodesk Inventor 
software. Depending on the version you have installed, you might fi nd that parts of this book 
are relevant to your version. For instance, if you have Autodesk Inventor LT installed, you will 
fi nd that Chapter 8 of this book will not apply to your version, since Autodesk Inventor LT does 
not include tools used for assembly design. Similarly, if you have Autodesk Inventor installed, 
you’ll fi nd that Chapter 17 does not apply to your version, since that chapter addresses tools 
found only in Autodesk Inventor Professional. To gain a better understanding of your version 
of the Autodesk Inventor software and how it relates to each subject in this book, please refer to 
the feature comparison matrix provided by Autodesk online. You can fi nd this by visiting the

Understanding Parametric Design
Autodesk Inventor is fi rst and foremost 3D parametric modeling software. And although it 
has capabilities reaching far beyond the task of creating 3D models, it is important for you to 
understand the fundamentals of parametric 3D design. The term parametric refers to the use of 
design parameters to construct and control the 3D model you create. For instance, you might 
begin a design by creating a base sketch to defi ne the profi le of a part. In this sketch you would 
use dimensions as parameters to control the length and width of the sketch. The dimensional 
parameters allow you to construct the sketch with precise inputs.
Creating a Base Sketch
Well-constructed parts start with well-constructed sketches. Typically, the 3D model starts with 
a 2D sketch, which is assigned dimensions and 2D sketch constraints to control the general size 
and shape. These dimensions and constraining geometries are the parameters, or input points, 
that you would then change to update or edit the sketch. For instance, Figure 1.1 shows a base 
sketch of a part being designed.

2 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Figure 1.1
Creating a parametric 
model sketch
You can see four dimensions placed on the two rectangles defi ning the length and width of 
each along with a fi fth dimension controlling the angle at which the two rectangles relate. These 
dimensions are parameters, and if you were to change one of them at any point during the 
design or revision of the part, the sketch would update and adjust to the change.
An important part of working with sketches is the concept of a fully constrained sketch. 
Fully constrained simply means that all of the needed dimensions and sketch constraints have 
been applied to achieve a sketch that cannot be manipulated accidentally or as an unintentional 
consequence of an edit. For instance, if you were to sketch four lines to defi ne a rectangle, you 
would expect two dimensions to be applied, defi ning the length and width. But you would 
also need to use 2D sketch constraints to constrain the lines so that they would stay perpen-
dicular and equal to one another if one of the dimensions were to change. Without the sketch 
constraints, a dimensional edit to make the rectangle longer might result in a trapezoid or a 
parallelogram rather than the longer rectangle you anticipated. By fully constraining a sketch, 
you can anticipate the way in which it will update. Inventor helps you with this concept by auto-
matically applying many sketch constraints and by reporting when a sketch is fully constrained. 
This will be covered in more detail in Chapter 3, “Sketch Techniques.”
Creating a Base Feature
Not only do you add 2D sketch parameters, but you also add parameters to control the 3D prop-
erties of parts. This is done by using the sketch to create a feature such as an extrusion to give a 
depth value to the sketch. The depth dimension is a parameter as well, and it can be updated at 
any time to adjust the part model as required. Figure 1.2 shows the sketch from Figure 1.1 after it 
has been given a depth using the Extrude tool.
Adding More Features
Once the part is three-dimensional, more sketches can be added to any of the faces of the 3D 
shape, and those new sketches can be used to create some feature that further defi nes the form 
and function of the design. The model is then enhanced with more features, such as holes, fi l-
lets, and chamfers, until it is complete. Each added feature is controlled by still more parameters 
defi ned by you, the designer. If a change is required, you simply update the parameter and the 
model updates accordingly. This type of parametric design allows you to build robust and intel-
ligent models quickly and update them even faster. Figure 1.3 illustrates the typical workfl ow of 
adding secondary features to a base feature to fully realize the part design, in this case a simple 
pivot link.

Using the Part in an Assembly
Just as well-constructed parts start with well-constructed sketches, well-constructed assemblies 
start with well-constructed parts. Once the part model is built up from the features you create, 
you can use it in an assembly of other parts created in the same manner. You can copy the part 
to create multiple instances of the same part, and you can copy the part fi le to create variations 
of the original part. To assemble parts, you create geometric relationships called assembly con-
straints to defi ne how the parts go together. The constraints are parameters that can be defi ned 
and revised by you at any time in the design process as well. Part models can be arranged into 
small assemblies and placed into larger assemblies to create a fully realized subassembly struc-
ture that matches the way your design will be built on the shop fl oor. Figure 1.4 shows the part 
model from the previous illustrations placed multiple times in a subassembly and then that sub-
assembly placed in a top-level assembly.
Making Changes
Once parts are created, they are then used in assemblies, which also employ parameters to 
defi ne the offsets and mating relationships between assembled parts. Designing with the use of 
parameters allows you to make edits quickly and lends itself to creating product confi gurations, 
where parameter values are changed to create variations of a basic design.

Of course, as with building anything, there are general rules and best practices to be learned 
and followed to prevent your work from “falling apart.” For instance, what if the pivot link used 
in the previous examples were to incur a design change that made one leg of the link longer? 
How would the holes be affected? Should they stay in the same place? Or should they stay at 
some defi ned distance from one end or the other?
Anticipating changes to the model is a large part of being successful with Inventor. Imagine, 
for instance, that a simple design change required that the pivot link become 50 millimeters lon-
ger on one leg. This should be a simple revision that requires you only to locate the dimension 
controlling that leg length and change the parameter value. Unfortunately, if you did not follow 
the best-practices guidelines when creating the part originally, the change in the length might 
displace the secondary features such as holes and material cuts and require you to stop and fi x 
each of those as well. This is one of the most frustrating parts of learning Inventor for any new 
user who has not taken the time to learn or follow the known best practices of parametric mod-
eling. Fortunately for you, within the pages of this book you will learn how to create models 
that are easy to update and do not “fall apart” during design changes.
Understanding History-Based Modeling and Dependencies
Inventor is often referred to as a history-based modeler, meaning that as you create sketches 
and turn them into features and then add more features and still more features, each addition 
is based on a previous feature, and so the model is said to have history. This history is recorded 
and tracked in the Model browser. The Model browser is a panel that displays on-screen and 
shows every feature you create during the design of your part. Figure 1.5 shows the Model 
browser for the pivot link fi le.
You can see that each feature is listed in the browser in the order in which it was created, 
forming a history tree. To create a part that handles changes predictably, you must create a solid 
foundation on which to build the rest of the model. In most cases, when you are designing a part 
model you will start with a sketch, much like the one shown back in Figure 1.1. This base sketch 
will be your foundation, and therefore you must create it to be as stable as possible.

UNDERSTANDING PARAMETRIC DESIGN | 5
Figure 1.5
Th e Model browser 
showing the feature 
tree (history) of a 
part named Pivot
_Link.ipt
Each part, no matter what it is or what it looks like, has a set of origin geometry in the form 
of the origin planes, origin axes, and a single origin point. You can fi nd these origin features 
by expanding the Origin folder in the Model browser. Figure 1.5 shows the Origin folder not 
expanded. If you expand the Origin folder in any part or assembly fi le, you will see the follow-
ing items:
 
◆
YZ plane, the plane that runs infi nitely in the Y and Z directions
 
◆
XZ plane, the plane that runs infi nitely in the X and Z directions
 
◆
XY plane, the plane that runs infi nitely in the X and Y directions
 
◆
X-axis, the axis running infi nitely in the X direction
 
◆
Y-axis, the axis running infi nitely in the Y direction
 
◆
Z-axis, the axis running infi nitely in the Z direction
 
◆
Center point, the point found at zero in the X, zero in the Y, and zero in the Z directions
When creating the base sketch of a part fi le, you typically start on one of the origin planes. 
Because the origin plane cannot be edited, deleted, redefi ned, or upset in any manner, this 
base sketch is inherently stable, and as a result, the base feature you create from it is stable as 
well. If the second sketch of your part is created on a 3D face of the base feature, this sketch is 
dependent on the base sketch and is considered slightly less stable than the base sketch. This 
is because the base sketch could be edited, deleted, or redefi ned in a way that would upset the 
secondary sketch.
Understanding how dependencies are created when a sketch and features are based on one 
another will help you avoid creating a “house of cards” that will fall apart if the base is upset. 
Although you could base all of your sketches and features on origin geometry to minimize 
dependencies, it is generally not practical to do so. It should be your goal, however, to keep the 
number of chained dependencies to a minimum. Assemblies work in much the same way, using 
the faces and edges of parts to constrain them together and as a result building dependencies 
between them. Just like part fi les, assembly fi les have origin planes, axes, and a center point that 
can be used to minimize chained dependencies, thereby creating a more stable model.

6 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Taking a Closer Look at Sketch Dimensions
A large part of creating a stable sketch comes from understanding the way sketch dimensions 
work in Inventor. To do so, you might compare Inventor dimensions with standard dimensions 
in Autodesk® AutoCAD® software. When you create a design in AutoCAD, that design process 
is not much different from creating the same design on a paper drawing. But in AutoCAD, you 
can draw precise lines, arcs, circles, and other objects and place them precisely and with accu-
rate dimensions refl ecting your design in a way that you cannot do by hand. When a design 
requires modifi cation, you erase, move, copy, stretch, and otherwise manipulate the existing 
geometry more quickly than you can by hand as well. But other than those gains in speed and 
accuracy, the workfl ow is much the same as working with pencil and paper. In short, AutoCAD 
automates drafting tasks but does less to speed up and enhance the design process. By compari-
son, Inventor’s sketch dimensions allow you to add design parameters and a bit of intelligence 
to your sketches.
Driven Dimensions
Standard dimensions in AutoCAD are called driven or reference dimensions. A driven dimension 
is controlled by the geometry, and it refl ects the actual value of the geometry being referenced 
by the dimension. If you stretch a line, for example, the dimension attached to the line will 
update to the new value. If you think about it, the only reason for a dimension on a traditional 
AutoCAD drawing is to convey the value of a feature or part to the person who is going to build 
it. If you import that 2D fi le into computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software, no dimen-
sions are needed because the line work contains all the information about the part.
Parametric AutoCAD
Starting with AutoCAD 2010, you can create 2D parametric dimensions and constraints much as 
you can in Inventor.
Driving Dimensions
The workfl ow in Inventor sketching is substantially different from that in traditional AutoCAD, 
even beyond dimensions. In Inventor, you create sketches in 2D and then add geometric con-
straints such as Horizontal, Vertical, Parallel, and so on, to further defi ne the sketch entities. 
Adding the geometric constraints allows line work to adjust in a predictable and desired man-
ner and helps control the overall shape of the sketch. Once geometric constraints are in place, 
you add parametric driving dimensions to the sketch geometry. By changing the value of these 
driving dimensions, you change or drive the size of the sketch object. Because of this, the 
Inventor dimension is far more powerful than the standard AutoCAD dimension because it not 
only conveys the value of a feature or part but also serves as a design parameter, allowing you to 
change the dimension to update the design. This is done simply by double-clicking the dimen-
sion and typing in a new value. Figure 1.6 shows a dimension being edited in a sketch on the left 
and the result on the right.

Part Modeling Best Practices
A solid sketch is the foundation on which stable parts are built. Many new users do not under-
stand the importance of having fully constrained sketches, and they fi nd it highly frustrating 
to have a model fail when a simple change is made, all because a sketch was not properly con-
structed. This frustration can be avoided by following some basic best practices.
Keep Sketches Simple
The most effective way to create a healthy sketch is to keep it simple. The purpose of keep-
ing your base sketch simple is to get it fully defi ned, leaving no part of it up for interpretation. 
Underdefi ned sketch entities (lines without defi ned lengths, circles without defi ned diameters, 
and so on) will most likely not update properly and will cause your sketches to distort and 
break when you try to update them. And because you often base the rest of your model on the 
initial sketch, your entire feature tree might incur errors, requiring you to stop and spend time 
rebuilding it again. Examine the sketch in Figure 1.1 and compare it to the fi nished shape shown 
in Figure 1.5. As you can see, the simple sketch containing two rectangles dimensioned at an 
angle defi nes the basic shape and is much easier to sketch and fully constrain than the fi nished 
shape would be.
If the idea of simple sketches seems at fi rst not to fi t the type of design you do, understand 
that most designs will benefi t from the simple-sketch philosophy. More important, if you start 
out employing simple sketches, you will more quickly master the sketch tools and then be ready 
to create more complex sketches when a design absolutely requires it.
Create Simple Features from Simple Sketches
Another aspect of creating simple sketches is that it allows you to create simple features. 
Parametric, feature-based modeling relies on the creation of numerous simpler features within 
the model to achieve a complex design in the end. By creating a number of features within the 
model, you are able to independently change or modify a feature without rebuilding the entire 
model. An example of editing a feature would be changing a hole size. If you create a simple 
rectangular base feature fi rst and then create a hole feature as a secondary feature to that base 
feature, you can make changes to both independently. By contrast, if you were to include a circle 
in your base sketch and use that to create the base feature with a circular profi le pocket, your 
hole would no longer be as easily updated. 

8 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Pattern and Mirror at the Feature Level
Although there are mirror and pattern (array) tools in the sketch environment, it is generally 
best to create a single instance of the item in the sketch, then create a feature from it, and fi nally 
create a mirror or pattern feature from that feature. The logic behind this is based on the idea of 
keeping sketches simple and the anticipation of future edits. Should the mirror or pattern fea-
ture need to be updated, it is much easier to update it as a separate feature.
Create Sketch-Based Features and Then Placed Features
Part features can be separated into two categories: sketch-based and placed. Sketch-based features, 
as you might guess, are created from sketches. Placed features are features such as fi llets and 
chamfers that are placed by using model edges or faces and have no underlying sketch. Issues 
arise when placed features are created too early in the development of the part because you 
may then be required to dimension to the placed feature, which creates a weak dependency. For 
instance, you might place rounded fi llet features along the edges of a part. Then you could use 
the tangent fi llet edges to defi ne the placement of a hole. But then if you realize that machining 
capabilities require a beveled chamfer edge rather than a rounded fi lleted one and delete the fi l-
let feature, the hole feature is sure to fail because the tangent fi llet edges used to defi ne the hole 
placement no longer exist. Keep this in mind as you create placed features such as fi llets and 
chamfers, and reserve placed features for the end stages of the part.
Understand Dependent and Independent Features
Parametric model features are typically either dependent or independent of one another. A 
dependent feature is dependent on the existence or position of a previously created feature. If 
that previously created feature is deleted, the dependent feature will either be deleted as well 
or become an independent feature. As mentioned earlier, each part fi le contains default origin 
geometry defi ning the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis of the part. These origin features are used to 
create the fi rst sketch in every part by default. An independent feature is normally based on an 
origin feature or is referenced off the base feature.
For instance, to create the base feature for the pivot link, you would create a sketch on a 
default origin plane, such as the XY plane. Because the XY origin plane is included in every part 
fi le and cannot be changed, your base feature is stable and independent of any other features 
that may follow. To create a hole in the base feature, you would typically select the face of the 
base feature to sketch on. Doing so would make the hole feature dependent on the base feature. 
The hole feature is then inherently less stable than the base feature because it relies on the base 
feature to defi ne its place in 3D space.
Although the specifi cs of how sketches, features, and parts are created will be covered in the 
chapters to come, remember these principles concerning part fi le best practices, and you will 
fi nd Inventor (and any other parametric modeler) much more accommodating.
Assembly Modeling Best Practices
Once you’ve created part fi les, you will put them together to build an assembly. And when you 
do, you want to build it to be as stable as possible so that if you move, replace, or remove a part, 
the rest of the assembly will not fall apart. There are two entities to an assembly fi le: links to the 
component fi les (parts or subassemblies) it is made of and the geometric information about how 

UNDERSTANDING PARAMETRIC DESIGN | 9
those components fi t together. Basic assemblies are not much more than that, and understand-
ing those two concepts will go a long way toward building stable assemblies.
Understand File Linking and Relationships
The assembly fi le can be thought of as an empty container fi le to start. Once you place the fi rst 
part in the assembly, the assembly fi le contains a link to the fi le for that part. When you place a 
second part and fi t it to the fi rst, the assembly then contains links to the two fi les and the infor-
mation about how those parts go together in this particular assembly. If you decide to rename 
the fi rst part fi le and do so using Windows Explorer, the assembly fi le will still look for the fi le 
by the old name. When this happens, you will be prompted with a fi le resolution dialog box 
asking you to locate the fi le. You can then browse and manually point the assembly to that fi le, 
and the assembly will record the new name in its internal link. If you decide to move the second 
part fi le to a folder other than its original, the assembly fi le might again prompt you to fi nd it 
manually, depending on the folder structure. It should be your goal to never need to resolve fi le 
links manually, and understanding this part of how assemblies work is the fi rst step in reaching 
that goal. In the coming chapters you will learn how to set up Inventor properly so it can fi nd 
your fi les.
Always Maintain at Least One Grounded Component
To understand how grounded parts help you build stable assemblies, you should fi rst under-
stand a little about the assembly Model browser. Figure 1.7 shows the Model browser for an 
assembly model of a small hobby-type CNC router.
Figure 1.7
Th e Model browser 
showing the model 
tree of an assembly 
named Router.iam
The Model browser shows an assembly named Router Base at the top and under it three 
other subassemblies named Y-Axis Assembly, X-Axis Assembly, and Z-Axis Assembly. The 
Z-Axis Assembly is expanded in the browser so you can see the parts it contains as well. You 
should note that the Router Base subassembly is shown in the browser with a pushpin button. 
This denotes that this subassembly is grounded, or pinned in place, and its coordinates cannot 
accidentally change. Keeping one grounded component in each assembly will allow you to fi t 
other parts to it without it moving or rotating off the x-, y-, and z-coordinates.

10 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Recall the old carnival game where you throw a ball at a pyramid stack of metal bottles. To 
win the game, you had to knock down all the bottles. However, if the bottle in the center on the 
bottom were nailed down, it would be impossible to win the game, and as a matter of physics, it 
would be diffi cult to knock down the bottles next to it. Having a grounded component in your 
assemblies, one that is “nailed down,” will likewise keep your assemblies from falling over as 
you build onto them. By default, the fi rst component you place into an empty assembly fi le will 
automatically be grounded. You can unground it and ground another if need be, but you should 
always maintain at least one grounded component. You can also have more than one grounded 
component.
Make Your Models Mimic the Manufacturing Process
The simplest advice that new users can receive on the subject of assemblies is to structure them 
as you would in real life. For example, if in the design you plan to assemble several parts into a 
transmission and then drop that transmission into a housing, you should make the transmis-
sion a subassembly and insert it into the upper-level housing assembly. Alternatively, a new 
user might place all the parts into one big assembly, only to later realize that subassemblies are 
needed for the purpose of getting the bill of materials (BOM) organized. This can be accom-
plished by using the Demote assembly tool to create the subassemblies and then demote the 
parts from the top-level assembly to these new subassemblies. By making your models mimic 
the manufacturing process, you can also fi nd possible fl aws in your design, such as fasteners 
that cannot be accessed or areas where parts may interfere with each other during assembly.
In some instances, a model will be developed in the research and development (R&D) 
department and then handed to the manufacturing engineering (ME) department to be built. 
Although the people in R&D may enjoy the freedom of “dreaming up” anything they can think 
of, an effective R&D designer will always think about what can actually be built within the 
capabilities of the shop fl oor. Keep this in mind during the initial development cycle, and it will 
prevent those downstream from having to re-create much of your work. However, if restruc-
turing the components into more or fewer subassemblies is required after the initial design, 
Inventor has demote and promote tools to assist with that. These tools will be covered in the 
chapters to come.
Constrain to Origin Geometry
As mentioned earlier in this chapter, each part fi le has default origin geometry built in. You 
should build parts around the origin geometry whenever possible. For instance, a transmission 
has gears, bearings, seals, and so on, that are all concentric with the shaft. If you model all the 
parts so their x-axes will be aligned in the assembly, then you can use the x-axis of each part 
to constrain to in the assembly and it will be much more stable. However, if you constrain the 
parts by selecting model features, you run the risk of constraints failing once a revision to a part 
changes or removes the originally referenced geometry. To build a completely “bulletproof” 
assembly, you could constrain the origin geometry of each part to the origin geometry of the 
assembly. In this way, no matter how the geometry of the parts changes, it will not cause issues 
with assembly constraints.
You will learn more about how to create assemblies, set up search paths to avoid manual 
fi le resolutions, and work with grounded components in the coming chapters, but you should 
remember these concepts and work to abide by them.

UNDERSTANDING THE “FEEL” OF INVENTOR | 11
Understanding the “Feel” of Inventor
To the new user, the ever-changing Inventor interface may seem a bit disorienting. Taking a few 
minutes to understand why menus and tools change from one context to another will go a long 
way in getting comfortable with the “feel” of Inventor and anticipating the way the user inter-
face works. If you’ve used other applications with the Microsoft ribbon-style interface, you’re 
probably already familiar with much of this context-specifi c behavior.
Understanding the Intuitive Interface
The overall user interface of Inventor might be called context intuitive, meaning that menus 
change depending on the task and the environment. Inventor is organized by tools grouped 
onto tabs, offering only the tools needed for the appropriate task at hand. If you are sketching a 
base feature, the tools you see are sketch tools. In Figure 1.8, the Sketch tab is active, and the dis-
played tools are the ones used to create and dimension sketches.
Figure 1.8
Th e Sketch tab and 
sketch tools
Upon the completion of a sketch, click the Finish Sketch button on the far right, and you will 
exit the sketch. The 3D Model tab then becomes active and the Sketch tab is hidden. This allows 
you to see the tools that are appropriate for the immediate task, and only those tools, without 
having to hunt around for them among tools that you are not able to use at the current moment. 
If you create a new sketch or edit an existing one, the Sketch tab is immediately brought back. 
Figure 1.9 shows the active 3D Model tab.
Figure 1.9
Th e 3D Model tab 
and model tools
When you work with assemblies, the active tab changes to the Assemble tab (as shown in 
Figure 1.10), allowing you to place components, create new components, pattern them, copy 
them, and so on. When in the assembly environment, there are also a number of other tabs 
shown that you can manually switch to (by clicking them) at any time to use the tools they 
contain.

12 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
When you create a 2D drawing of parts or assemblies, you are automatically presented 
with tools needed to create views and annotation. By default, the Place Views tab is displayed 
because you need to create a view of a model before annotating it. However, you can manually 
switch to the Annotate tab by clicking it. Figure 1.11 shows the active Place Views tab and the 
inactive Annotate tab next to it.
Figure 1.11

and drawing tools
As you can see, the collection of tabs (called the Ribbon menu) changes intuitively with 
every task or environment you switch to. With this task-based user interface, there is no need 
to display every possible tool all at once. In the next section, you will explore more of the user

In this section you’ll see how Inventor tools are set up, using AutoCAD tools as a comparison. 
If you’ve never used AutoCAD, you can still gain some insight from this section, although you 
may have to use your imagination concerning the references to AutoCAD. A key difference 
between AutoCAD and Inventor is that in AutoCAD, many commands are very specifi c. For 
example, there are different dimension commands for lines, angles, and circles. In contrast, 
Inventor has one General Dimension tool that creates the appropriate dimension based on what 
you select.
For instance, in AutoCAD you might select the horizontal dimension tool to place a dimension 
on a horizontal line, select the diameter dimension tool to place a dimension on a hole, select a 
radius dimension tool to place a dimension on a fi llet, and so on. But in Inventor you select the 
General Dimension tool and select a horizontal line, and you get a horizontal dimension; then, 
without exiting the General Dimension tool, you select a circle, and you automatically get a diam-
eter dimension. And of course to dimension a fi llet, you continue with the General Dimension 
tool, and you will automatically get a radius dimension.
Drawing in AutoCAD Becomes Sketching in Inventor
Th e fundamental diﬀ erence between traditional AutoCAD and Inventor is that in AutoCAD you 
draw and in Inventor you sketch. Th is diﬀ erence sounds subtle, but it is important. In AutoCAD, you 
likely construct lines precisely to speciﬁ c dimensions to form the geometry required. In Inventor, 
you create lines and geometry that reﬂ ect the general form and function of the feature and then 
use constraints and dimensions to coax it into the desired shape. Expecting Inventor to work just 
like AutoCAD is probably the single biggest stumbling block that experienced AutoCAD users face 
when starting to use Inventor.

UNDERSTANDING THE “FEEL” OF INVENTOR | 13
When in Doubt, Right-Click
Inventor is very right-click–driven, meaning that many of the options are context specifi c and 
can be accessed by right-clicking the object in question. For instance, if you want to edit a 
sketch, you right-click the sketch in the browser and choose Edit Sketch. The same is true of a 
feature. If you want to change a hole feature from a countersink to a counterbore, you right-click 
it in the browser and choose Edit Feature. You can also right-click many objects in the graphics 
window, with no need to locate them in the browser. Figure 1.12 shows a typical right-click con-
text menu with the default marking menu option enabled.
Figure 1.12
A typical right-click 
marking menu
Also worth mentioning are the options in the context menus. For instance, if you are editing 
a part in an assembly and want to fi nish the edit and return to the assembly level, you could 
use the Return button on the Sketch tab menu, or you could just right-click (taking care not 
to click any sketch object) and choose Finish Edit from the context menu. Both options do the 
same thing.
Traditional Right-Click Menus vs. the Marking Menus
When enabled, marking menus replace the traditional right-click context menu. Since marking 
menus are customizable, this book references the traditional right-click menu, so speciﬁ c refer-
ences to items in the right-click menus may need to be interpreted if you choose to use the marking 
menus or have customized your marking menus. To enable or disable the marking menus, select 
Customize on the Tools tab of the ribbon and then select the Marking Menu tab. Th en check or 
uncheck the Use Classic Context Menu check box.
Selections from the marking menu can be made in either menu mode or mark mode.
Menu Mode  When you right-click in the graphics window, menu items surround the cur-
sor. Simply click a menu item to select it.
Mark Mode  When you press and hold the right mouse button and immediately move the 
cursor in the direction of a known menu item, a “mark” trail appears. Release the mouse 
button to select the menu item corresponding to the direction of cursor movement in the 
marking menu.

Using the Graphical Interface
The Inventor graphical interface might be different from what you are accustomed to in other 
general software applications and even different from other design software. In Figure 1.13, you 
see the entire Inventor window, which shows a part fi le open for editing.
Figure 1.13

Inventor screen in 
part modeling mode
Inventor Title Bar
Starting at the upper left of the Inventor window, you’ll see the Inventor button (look for the 
large I character), which has a drop-down panel similar to the File menu in previous versions. 
Next to the Inventor button the title bar includes two toolbars:
 
◆
The Quick Access bar has frequently used tools.
 
◆
The Help toolbar provides access to help fi les and Autodesk websites.
You can customize the Quick Access bar for each fi le type by selecting and deselecting but-
tons from a list. The list of available tools can be accessed by clicking the drop-down arrow 
shown on the far right of Figure 1.14.

Definition
Th e New button launches the New File dialog box. Th e drop-down list allows you to 
create a new part, assembly, drawing, or presentation ﬁ le using the standard 
templates.
Th e Open button launches the Open dialog box. It displays a location deﬁ ned in 
your active project.
Th e Save button saves the ﬁ le.
Th e Undo button undoes the last action. Th e Undo list tracks changes for the cur-
rent Inventor session, not just the current document. If you have two part ﬁ les 
open, this button will undo changes that are made in both ﬁ les. Undo will also 
close ﬁ les if your undo sequence takes you back past the point of a ﬁ le being opened 
or created.
Th e Redo button restores a change that was removed with Undo. It will reopen a ﬁ le 
that was closed with Undo.
Th e Update button updates the ﬁ les. For example, if you edit a part in an assembly, 
other parts might need to be updated because of the changes. Th is button is grayed 
out unless the ﬁ le needs to be refreshed.
Th e Select button allows you to choose a ﬁ lter for object selection.
Th e Material button and drop-down box allow you to change the component mate-
rial. Clicking the button displays the material browser. Selecting a material from 
the drop-down changes the component’s material property. 
Th e Appearance button and drop-down box allow you to change the component 
color. Clicking the button displays the appearance browser. Selecting an appear-
ance from the drop-down changes the component’s color appearance.
Th e Adjust button allows you to modify the color and texture appearance.
Th e Clear button allows you to remove overrides to the component’s color and tex-
ture appearances.
Th e Parameter button is used to access the parameters table, where you can 
rename, change, and create equations in dimension and design parameters.
Th e Measure Distance button brings up the Measure tool, allowing you to take 
distance, angle, loop, or area measurements from model edges, vertices, and faces.
Th e Design Doctor button launches a dialog box that helps you diagnose and repair 
issues with a ﬁ le. Th e button is grayed out unless there is an issue.

Graphics Window Tools
Inventor has two sets of tools for manipulating the graphics window:
 
◆
The ViewCube® is used to change the view orientation.
 
◆
The Navigation bar has tools such as Zoom and Pan.
Exploring the ViewCube
The ViewCube, shown in Figure 1.15, is a 3D tool that allows you to rotate the view. 
Figure 1.15
Th e ViewCube
Here are some viewing options:
 
◆
If you click a face, edge, or corner of the ViewCube, the view rotates so the selection is 
 perpendicular to the screen.
 
◆
If you click and drag an edge, the view rotates around the parallel axis.
 
◆
If you click and drag a corner, you can rotate the model freely.
 
◆
If you click a face to have an orthogonal view, additional controls will display when your 
mouse pointer is near the cube.
 
◆
The four arrowheads pointed at the cube rotate the view to the next face.
 
◆
The arc arrows rotate the view by 90 degrees in the current plane.
If you click the Home button (it looks like a house), the view rotates to the default isometric 
view. Clicking the drop-down arrow or right-clicking the Home button reveals several options 
to change the default isometric view behavior. For instance, you can modify the home view 
to any view you like, and you can reset the front view in relation to your model so the named 
views of the cube match what you consider the front, top, right, and so on.
Using a Wheel Mouse and 3D-Input Device
Using a wheel mouse with Inventor is recommended. Scrolling the wheel will perform a Zoom 
In/Out, while pressing the wheel will perform the Pan function. In Inventor, the wheel zoom is 
reversed from AutoCAD. You can change this setting by clicking Application Options on the Tools 
tab, selecting the Display tab, and selecting Reverse Direction in the 3D Navigation group.
Another useful tool for navigating in Inventor is a 3D-input device. A popular brand is the Space 
series made by 3Dconnexion. Th ese devices are small “joysticks” or “pucks” that sit on your desk. 
Th e user grasps the puck and, by making very slight movements with the device, moves the 
model on the screen. Pulling, pushing, and twisting the puck allows you to zoom, pan, and orbit 
the model on-screen. Although you may ﬁ nd these devices awkward at ﬁ rst, most users say they 
could never work as eﬃ  ciently without one after just a few days of use.

USING THE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE | 17
A Look at the Navigation Bar
Continuing with the interface tour, you’ll see the Navigation bar located on the right side of 
the graphics window. At the top of the bar is the steering wheel. Below the steering wheel 
are the other standard navigation tools: Pan, Zoom, Orbit, and Look At. Figure 1.16 shows the 
Navigation bar.
Figure 1.16
Th e Navigation bar
You can use the Navigation bar’s steering wheel to zoom, pan, walk, and look around the 
graphics area. Also available is the ability to rewind through previous steering wheel actions. 
The steering wheel has more functionality than can be explored in this book. You should review 
the help topics for more information (click the steering wheel and then press F1).
Th e Ribbon Menu
The Ribbon menu is composed of tabs and panels and is similar to the menu used in Microsoft 
Offi ce products (starting with Offi ce 2007). Each tab contains panels for a particular task, such 
as creating sketches, and each panel contains related buttons for the tools. As previously men-
tioned, the ribbon will change to the proper tab based on the current task (for example, sketching 
brings up the Sketch tab, which allows you to click the Line tool button), but you can select a dif-
ferent tab as needed.
You can customize the Ribbon menu by right-clicking it and choosing among the following:
 
◆
Turning off tool button text, reducing button size, or using a compact button layout
 
◆
Turning off panels that you don’t use
 
◆
Adding frequently used commands to a tab
 
◆
Minimizing the ribbon
 
◆
Undocking the ribbon so it becomes a fl oating tool palette
 
◆
Docking the ribbon on the left, right, or top of the Inventor window
The Get Started Tab
On the Get Started tab of the Ribbon menu the tools on the Launch panel are used to access and 
create fi les. The rest of the buttons found on the Get Started tab link to help topics. You can use 
the What’s New button to read about the new features for the current release as well as the last 
few releases. The Videos and Tutorials tools contain built-in tutorials and a collection of learn-
ing resources. Figure 1.17 shows the Get Started tab and its tools.

18 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Figure 1.17
Tools found on the 
Get Started tab
The View Tab
The View tab, shown in Figure 1.18, has controls for object visibility and appearance, window 
control, and navigation. There are some variations in the buttons, depending on the environ-
ment, but most of the buttons are used in all of the modeling environments.
Figure 1.18
Th e View tab
Visibility Panel
The Visibility panel has tools for controlling which objects are visible. When you click Object 
Visibility, a large list is displayed so you can control the visibility of the listed objects in your 
graphics window.
Appearance Panel
The Appearance panel has tools for controlling the way models are displayed. You can dis-
play the model in a number of visual styles, such as Realistic, Shaded, Shaded With Edges, 
Illustration, and many more.
Visual Styles and Performance
Inventor includes a number of enhanced visual styles, shadows, and reﬂ ection options that might 
have a negative impact on your graphics performance if your workstation is a bit older. If you notice 
issues with your graphics display, you can go to the Tools tab, click the Application Options button, 
click the Hardware tab, and then select the Performance or Compatibility option.
Another important option found on the Appearance panel is the View Camera Projection 
setting, which allows you to choose between orthographic and perspective views. Setting the 
perspective options to be current displays the model with a vanishing point, as it would be in 
the real world. With the Orthographic option, points of the model are projected along lines par-
allel to the screen.
Using a perspective view may be desirable when viewing the model in a 3D view, but it 
can be distracting when sketching on a fl at face or viewing the model from a standard 2D 

USING THE GRAPHICAL INTERFACE | 19
orthographic view because you see what appear to be tapering faces and edges. However, you 
can get the best of both projections by setting the ViewCube to Perspective With Ortho Faces so 
that the model is displayed in orthographic mode when one of the standard orthographic faces 
is active and in perspective mode in any other view. To do this, simply right-click the ViewCube 
and you will see the option. Note that this setting is set for each document rather than for the 
application itself, so you will typically need to do this for each model.
Windows Panel
Most of the tools in the Windows panel are standard controls, such as for switching tiling 
windows. If you click User Interface, a list of items such as the ViewCube and the status bar 
are displayed. The Clean Screen button hides most of the UI elements. Only the title bar and a 
minimized ribbon bar are displayed. Although the Clean Screen setting certainly maximizes 
your screen real estate, it turns off one very critical interface object, the browser pane. To use the 
Clean Screen function effectively, you must turn the browser pane back on. To do so, click the 
View tab, use the User Interface drop-down, and select the Browser option. You can click the 
View tab again and then click the Clean Screen button again to disable it and display the tools 
panels again. 
Navigate Panel
Also on the View tab is a Navigate panel. The tools in the Navigate panel are the same as those 
found on the Navigation bar, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Many of these tools, such as 
Pan, Zoom, and Orbit, can be accessed by using the buttons on your mouse and/or the function 
keys. For instance, spinning the wheel on a standard three-button mouse allows you to zoom in 
and out. Similarly, if you hold down the F4 button on the keyboard, you will see that the Orbit 
tool is active.
Th e Browser Pane
The browser pane (often called the Model browser) is a listing of everything that makes up an 
Inventor fi le. The part browser shows all of the features, the assembly browser shows all of the 
components, and the drawing browser shows the sheets with the views. Because Inventor fi les 
are similar to actual parts and assemblies, the browser plays an important role in navigating 
the fi les.
Turning on a Missing Model Browser
Although it isn’t common to need to turn the Model browser oﬀ , you can do so. More commonly, 
you may accidentally turn it oﬀ  by clicking the X button on the right side of the browser title bar. 
To display it again, from the View tab click the User Interface button found on the Windows panel. 
You’ll most likely want to have all the items in this list selected.
Dialog Boxes and the In-Canvas Mini-Toolbars
As you use Inventor you will notice that there are often two sets of input controls: the traditional 
dialog box controls and the in-canvas mini-toolbars. The inputs in the dialog box are the same 
as those found in the mini-toolbars, and therefore you can use either one to input information or 
change options. Changing an option in one updates it in the other. You can use the arrow at the 

20 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
bottom of the dialog box to expand or collapse it. Figure 1.19 shows both sets of controls as they 
appear for editing a simple extrusion.
Figure 1.19
Dialog box and 
mini-toolbar 
controls
If you fi nd the mini-toolbar controls become distracting by popping up in a position that is 
in the way of making selections on-screen, you can use the Mini Toolbar Options menu button 
(the button on the far right of the last row) to pin the mini-toolbar to a location on-screen of your 
choosing.
Task-Based Tools
You saw in the previous section that the tabs of the Ribbon menus update based on the current 
environment. For instance, when in the sketch environment, the Sketch tab is active. The task-
based nature of the available tools is common throughout Inventor. For example, many Inventor 
dialog boxes are also task based. Instead of containing every control needed for every environ-
ment, most dialog boxes display only the controls necessary for the current task. In Figure 1.20, 
two Extrude dialog boxes are shown.
Figure 1.20
Solid and surface 
Extrude dialog 
boxes
Because creating and editing a solid extrusion is different from creating and editing a surface 
extrusion, some options are simply grayed out and not available. You will notice this throughout 
Inventor as options are offered and suppressed depending on the task at hand.

LEARNING THE FILE TYPES IN INVENTOR | 21
Learning the File Types in Inventor
If you’ve used AutoCAD, you might be accustomed to having the DWG (.dwg) fi le format as 
your primary fi le format; in Microsoft Word you might use primarily just a DOC (.doc) fi le; and 
in Microsoft Excel, you might use the XLS (.xls) fi le type for most of the work you do. All three 
of these commonly used programs use a single primary fi le type throughout. Inventor, on the 
other hand, follows the structure common to most other 3D modelers in the engineering fi eld 
today and uses different fi le types for different tasks.
The purpose of using multiple fi le types is so the data load is distributed into many different 
fi les instead of having all information in one fi le. For instance, you use an IPT (.ipt) fi le to cre-
ate an Inventor part fi le, an IAM (.iam) fi le to assemble that part with other parts, and an IDW 
(.idw) fi le to make a detail drawing of the parts and the assembly.
Placing the data in multiple fi les permits quicker load times, promotes fi le integrity, and 
vastly improves performance across the board on large designs. For example, when you open 
an assembly made of 12 different part fi les, only the information concerning the fi le paths and 
the way the parts fi t together in the assembly is loaded along with the information required 
to display the parts. It is only when you decide to edit a part that the information about all of 
that part’s features is loaded. As you learned in the previous section, having different fi le types 
allows you to use environment-specifi c tools. So if you edit a part from within an assembly fi le, 
Inventor automatically presents the Part editing tools.
Turning on Filename Extensions
It’s often helpful when working with Inventor ﬁ les to be able to view the ﬁ lename extensions. By 
default, Windows hides the extensions for known ﬁ le types. To show ﬁ lename extensions, follow 
these steps for Windows 7:
 1. Open Folder Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, and then clicking Folder 
Options. (If Folder Options is not available, change View By to Large Icons in the upper-right por-
tion of Control Panel.)
 2. Select the View tab, and uncheck the Hide Extensions For Known File Types option.
Another payoff of multiple fi le types is exemplifi ed in the comparison between the way 
AutoCAD handles tasks related to model space/paper space and the way Inventor handles the 
same tasks. To put it simply, in Inventor the part and assembly fi les are the model (model space), 
and the drawing fi le is in effect paper space. Using multiple fi le types to handle the separate 
tasks required for modeling versus detailing simplifi es the interaction between both tasks, and 
as a result, the headaches of managing model space and paper space that exist in AutoCAD are 
eliminated in Inventor.
Table 1.2 describes the fi lename extensions for the fi le formats commonly used in Inventor.

Although this list may seem intimidating, once you become familiar with Inventor, having 
many different fi le types will be less of a concern. The benefi t of using multiple fi le types to 
have fully associative, automatically updating designs is a cornerstone of most 3D parametric 
modelers. Performance and stability in the use of Inventor require good data management prin-
ciples, including storing the saved fi les in an effi cient and organized manner.
DWG File Size
Although the beneﬁ ts of using an Inventor DWG instead of an IDW may be favorable, you should 
be aware that the extra abilities of the DWG ﬁ le do come at the expense of ﬁ le size. Inventor DWGs 
are typically two to three times larger than identical IDW ﬁ les. If you create large assemblies, it is 
advisable to use the IDW template as opposed to the DWG to keep ﬁ les manageable. Th e extent to 
which the DWG in Inventor is employed will largely be determined by the amount of collaboration 
required between Inventor and AutoCAD users.
What Is an Inventor Project?
Whether you use Inventor as a stand-alone user or as part of a design group, you should con-
fi gure and use an Inventor project fi le to help Inventor resolve fi le links and keep your designs 
organized. You can think of project fi les in Inventor simply as confi guration fi les that tell Inventor 
where to look for component fi les when working with assemblies and drawings. For instance, an 
Inventor assembly fi le is essentially an empty “bucket” into which parts (and subassemblies) are 
placed and assembled. Therefore, the assembly fi le contains only the fi le path references for the 
components it is composed of and the information about how those components are assembled. 
As a result, the location of referenced fi les is a key issue.

WHAT IS AN INVENTOR PROJECT? | 23
If, when an assembly is opened, referenced fi les cannot be found at the search path recorded 
in the assembly fi le, a manual fi le resolution process is activated. This happens most often when 
component fi les are renamed or moved outside the search path established in the project fi le.
A Note to Autodesk® Inventor LT™ Users
If you are using the Autodesk Inventor LT software, you should be aware that it doesn’t use project 
ﬁ les, and therefore this book’s instructions concerning Inventor project ﬁ les do not apply.
Project Files and Search Paths
Project fi les are often referred to as IPJ fi les because .ipj is the extension for project fi lenames. 
You can create a project fi le anywhere it makes sense to do so, and Inventor will look at that 
location and lower in the directory structure for the fi les in your design. Take a moment and 
study the fi le structure shown in Figure 1.21.
Figure 1.21
A job-based folder 
structure
Figure 1.21 shows a typical job-based folder structure, where all fi les are located on the 
Engineering (I:) drive. Engineering contains three subfolders: CAD Files, Data Sheets, and 
Templates. In the CAD Files folder are three more folders: Content Center Files, Designs, 
and Library Files. The Designs folder contains a folder for each job (named using the job 
number) and subfolders containing revisions. So, where would you create an Inventor project 
fi le? There are two basic solutions: create multiple IPJ fi les for each new job or create a single all-
encompassing IPJ fi le for the entire engineering drive. Which method you should use depends 
largely on the way your engineering department operates.
Job-Based IPJ Setups
You could create one project fi le for each of the four jobs. You would have a fi le named 07–0114–
01.ipj in the 07–0114–01 folder, one named 07–1121–01.ipj in the 07–1121–01 folder, and so 
on. This strategy can work fi ne if you typically work on one project at a time and then “close” 
the project upon completion. In Inventor, you would simply switch to the specifi c project fi le that 
matches the job number for the job you are working on (for example, 07–0114–01), and because 
the IPJ fi le is stored in that folder, Inventor will search for design fi les only in its workspace. The 
workspace is defi ned as the folder containing the IPJ folder and everything below it. It may help 
to think of a workspace as a search cone, starting at the IPJ and spreading out from that point.

24 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
This job-based approach is fairly intuitive and is what people generally think of when they 
see the term project fi le: one IPJ fi le for each job/project. This is a common approach when a job 
has a long development cycle and designs are specifi c to that job.
But what happens if you want to use a part that was created for job 07–0114–01 in job 
08–0614–10? You could place the part into the 08–0614–10 assembly, but the next time you 
opened that assembly, Inventor would not be able to fi nd it because it exists outside of the 
08–0614–10 workspace. If you were to move a part fi le from the 07–0114–01 folder into the 
08–0614–10 folder, Inventor would not fi nd it while you were working on job 07–0114–01 
because it would now be outside of its workspace. Likewise, if you moved the fi le up to the 
Designs folder, to the CAD Files folder, or to (almost) any location that is not next to or below 
the 07–0114–01.ipj fi le, Inventor would not fi nd it as long as you are working with the 
07–0114–01.ipj project fi le. If you copy the fi le to the 08–0614–10 folder, then you have two 
versions of it and it becomes diffi cult to track changes because you need to update both copies to 
keep everything up-to-date.
The solution would be to confi gure the IPJ fi le to include a library. When a folder is confi g-
ured to be used as a library in an IPJ fi le, Inventor sees all of the fi les in that folder (and its sub-
folders) as read-only. This protects commonly used fi les from being accidentally changed and 
upsetting all of the many designs in which they may be used.
To solve the issue of the commonly used part in this example, you could confi gure each of 
your IPJ fi les to use the folder named Library Files as a library of approved, read-only parts 
to be used across multiple jobs. Whenever you open an assembly, Inventor fi rst looks in the 
library path for the parts and then looks at the workspace. So, to convert a part created as part of 
the 07–0114–01 job into a library part, you would follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the fi le to the library folder.
 
2. If the original fi le has a job-specifi c name, rename the copy according to a defi ned library 
nomenclature.
 
3. Open the assembly (or assemblies) that uses the original part.
 
4. Use the Replace Components tool to replace the original part with the library part in the 
assembly.
 
5. Save and close the assembly.
 
6. Delete the original part so that no duplicate is present.
Single IPJ Setups
The multiple project fi le strategy described previously is often not the best approach for many 
design departments, because of various contributing factors. When this is the case, using a 
single project fi le should be considered. Using the same folder structure shown in Figure 1.21 as 
an example, you could use a single all-encompassing IPJ fi le and place it in the Designs folder. 
By doing so, you would be setting the workspace at that level. This confi gures the search paths 
in Inventor to look for fi les in the Designs folder and everything below it. Essentially, you have 
expanded the search cone by moving it up a level compared to the job-based setup. Now if you 
need to use a part that resides in the 07–0114–01 folder in the 08–0614–10 assembly, you can do 
so and Inventor will be able to fi nd it, without requiring it to be in a library folder.
Of course, you can still use library folders when using the single IPJ fi le approach, and in 
fact it is generally recommended that you convert common parts to library parts when they are 

WHAT IS AN INVENTOR PROJECT? | 25
being used in many different designs. Because folders confi gured as libraries in the IPJ fi le are 
handled as read-only, this protects them from accidental modifi cations.
One major caveat to using just a single IPJ fi le is that in order to prevent the possibility of the 
wrong part being loaded in an assembly, it is important for every part located in the search path 
to have a unique name. If Inventor fi nds two fi les named BasePlate01, it will either use the fi rst 
one it fi nds or stop and make you decide which one to use. In either case, you should consider a 
nomenclature that references the job number, date, or other unique identifi er in the name.
Item-Based Setups
If your company uses an item-based fi le management setup and tracks each part you create 
or purchase as an item, you are probably not concerned with job numbers as much as you are 
about part numbers. Most likely you will want to employ a single IPJ fi le setup as described pre-
viously and again place the IPJ fi le in the Designs folder. Additionally, your fi le structure may 
be a bit fl atter and look like Figure 1.22, where the Designs folder has no subfolders.
Figure 1.22
An item-based 
folder structure
In this fl atter structure, you can simplify the folder structure and drop all fi les into the 
Designs folder, as shown in Figure 1.23.
Figure 1.23
A simpliﬁ ed folder 
structure
Of course, you could also still populate the Designs folder with subfolders named by product 
line, by top-level item, or for each job, just as it was done back in Figure 1.21. Typically, it is best 
to set up the IPJ fi le to accommodate your current fi le management system. However, if your 
current system is a mess or is simply no longer a good fi t for your company, you might take the 
opportunity to reorganize and plan a good system and set up Inventor accordingly.

26 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Library Folders and Library Editor IPJ Files
As described earlier, library folders contain existing, shared components. Library folders are 
useful repositories for purchased parts such as fasteners, clamps, motors, and connectors as 
well as any other common, standard components. Library folder paths are defi ned in the IPJ 
fi le. Once the IPJ fi le is confi gured and set active, all components stored in a folder designated 
as a library fi le are considered to be read-only by Inventor. This prevents the component from 
being unintentionally edited or from being revised without appropriate approvals. For example, 
before you modify a design that was completed as part of another job, it’s important to deter-
mine where else that part was used. The goal is to ensure that the changes you plan will not 
render the part unusable for other designs.
Library folders should be located outside the main IPJ workspace path. In the job-based direc-
tory structure example shown in Figure 1.21, the Library Files folder is on the same directory 
level as the Designs folder and therefore outside the workspace search path. Library folders can 
be located anywhere outside the primary project data path, even on different drives or mapped 
servers. You should note that if you set up a library path in the IPJ fi le to a folder that does not 
exist, Inventor will create the folder as specifi ed in the path. A good way to set up libraries is to 
set the path, let Inventor create the folder so that you know it’s in the right place, and then popu-
late the folder with the library fi les.
So if folders confi gured as libraries are confi gured as read-only in the IPJ fi le, how are con-
trolled, purposeful revisions carried out on library fi les? The answer is to create an IPJ fi le 
 confi gured to look at the library folder as a standard folder. For instance, you might create an 
IPJ fi le in the Library Files folder and assign it no library path. You would then switch to 
this IPJ fi le only when doing library maintenance. Because this IPJ has no library path called 
out, the fi les are not handled as read-only when Inventor is using this IPJ fi le. Often in a large 
engineering department only a couple of people have access to the library editor project fi le. 
When other team members see a need to change a library fi le, they would submit a change order 
and the designated person (or people) would then make the change.
Content Center Files
In the previous fi gures you may have noticed a folder called Content Center Files. This is a 
special kind of library that stores component fi les generated by Inventor’s Content Center tools. 
The path to this folder is specifi ed in the IPJ fi le, much as a library fi le is.
It is important to understand what Content Center is and how it works. Content Center 
libraries are collections of table data containing the defi nitions used to create more than 800,000 
standard parts and features. This database is managed by the Desktop Content settings or the 
Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS). Once you’ve installed the content libraries, you can 
use the content in your designs. To do this, choose a component from the database to place into 
your design, typically by using the Place From Content Center button in the assembly environ-
ment. It is at this point that the Content Center part fi le is created. Up to this point, the part 
existed only as a defi nition in the database table.
In your IPJ, you need to specify a Content Center fi le store location so that Inventor knows 
where to save the fi le and where to fi nd it next time. The fi le store folder will include additional 
subfolders where Content Center fi les will be stored once they are used in your designs. These 
additional folders are created automatically as parts are created. The next time a part is specifi ed 
from Content Center libraries, Inventor fi rst searches Content Center fi le store directories and 
then creates the part from the database only if the part fi le does not already exist in the fi le store 

WHAT IS AN INVENTOR PROJECT? | 27
location. It is required that the Content Center fi le store location be outside the main project data 
path. From this discussion of libraries, you can see that high importance is placed on planning 
the correct part locations and workfl ow.
How Search Paths and Project Files Are Used
The IPJ fi les in Inventor are easy to create and use, provided you understand how Inventor uses 
them. An Inventor project fi le is a confi guration fi le that lists the locations and functions of each 
search path. Inventor uses these defi nitions to resolve fi le links and locate the fi les needed for 
the parts and assemblies on which you want to work. Figure 1.24 shows how Inventor loads 
assemblies and parts inside an assembly fi le.

28 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
When opening an assembly fi le, Inventor fi nds fi les by searching for the fi rst fi le to be located 
within the assembly fi le. Inventor fi rst looks in the library folders for that fi le. Next, Inventor 
searches in the local workspace for the fi le. When a fi le is not found in any of the referenced 
folders, Inventor launches a manual fi le resolution dialog box offering you the opportunity to 
browse and point to the fi le manually.
Exploring Project File Types
As mentioned previously, fi le management in Inventor is handled through the use of a project 
fi le (*.ipj). A project fi le is a confi guration fi le set up and used to control how Inventor creates 
and resolves fi le links, where you edit fi les, how many old versions of the fi les to keep, and how 
Content Center fi les are stored and used. In the early days of Inventor, Autodesk offered two 
basic project types: single-user projects and multiuser projects. At this point, the Autodesk Vault 
project has replaced the earlier multiuser project types.
Unless you have installed Vault, you have only one project type to choose from by default: 
the single-user project. The term single-user could be considered a misnomer because this project 
type is widely used by one-person shops and multiseat design departments alike. Single-user 
does not mean that only one user can access the fi les in the project, as it might suggest; instead, 
it refers to the fact that there are no means of preventing fi les from being accessed for editing 
while another user is already editing the fi le. This can create a last-person-to-save-wins situa-
tion if care is not taken.
Single-User Projects among Multiple Users
What happens when two users access the same ﬁ le in a single-user project? Typically this is ﬁ rst 
noticed when one of the two tries to save the ﬁ le. Inventor notiﬁ es the person trying to save that 
they are not working with the most current version and gives the other user’s name (depending on 
the network setup) so the ﬁ rst user knows what is going on. Inventor instructs the user that they 
must save the ﬁ le using a diﬀ erent name to prevent losing the changes made.
Typically, at this point a conversation takes place to determine how to proceed. If it is decided that 
the ﬁ rst person is the one who needs to save changes, then the ﬁ le this person was working on is 
saved using another name, the original ﬁ le is deleted (or renamed as a reserve), and the other ﬁ le 
is renamed to replace the original. In this way, the changes that were made to the original ﬁ le are 
preserved.
Although this may seem like a terrible hassle, there are many design departments that use single-
user projects in a team setting eﬀ ectively and only rarely run into this situation. More than likely 
you already have an idea of how often you and your colleagues handle the same ﬁ les at the same 
time. But if you try to use single-user projects and ﬁ nd this situation happens fairly often, you 
should consider a true multiuser project.
Many design departments use single-user projects effectively in collaborative environments 
because of workfl ows that lend themselves to this type of project; others make it work by simply 
maintaining good communication among the design team. For collaborative environments that 

CREATING A PROJECT FILE | 29
require some safeguard against situations in which users could potentially save over one anoth-
er’s work, using a multiuser project (Vault project) is recommended.
Autodesk Vault is a data management application that, as the name implies, locks down fi les 
for their protection. Once a fi le is in Vault, it must be checked out by a user to be edited. Vault 
typically resides on a fi le server where the entire design team can access it. When the fi le is 
checked out of the Vault server, it is placed on the user’s local machine for editing. The next user 
who comes along and attempts to access that fi le can access only a read-only version. Once the 
fi rst user has fi nished editing, the fi le is checked back into Vault and automatically versioned.
It is also important to note that Inventor installs with a default project setup. The default proj-
ect is typically not used for production work because it is not fully confi gurable and will almost 
always lead to fi le resolution issues because it has no defi ned search path.
Creating a Good Data-Management Plan
A good data management plan is the key to using Inventor projects successfully. Using Vault will 
not resolve a poor project ﬁ le or data management strategy.
One part of a successful Inventor deployment is the hardware and network on which the software 
will run. It is important that the engineering group has buy-in by the IT group. You will need to 
discuss several issues with this group, including hardware for servers and workstations, the network 
setup (100BaseT or Gigabit), mapped network drives, and user permissions. A good server can be 
the diﬀ erence between success and failure in your rollout.
Although you do need to think about your ﬁ le structure, don’t obsess over it. Most likely you will 
end up changing the structure at least a few times before you settle on a ﬁ nal structure. Keep an 
open mind, and realize that if you have ﬁ ve people in a room discussing ﬁ le structures, you’ll end 
up with ﬁ ve diﬀ erent ideas. Again, involve IT in your discussions.
Finally, you should designate one person in engineering to be the engineering administrator. Th is 
person needs to have administrative privileges on the engineering server or network share. IT may 
resist, but you have to keep pushing. Th is is important because you will need the ability to easily 
create, delete, and move ﬁ les and folders without having to submit a help-desk ticket. Nothing will 
slow down a design process faster than having to wait for IT to make a simple change. Explain this 
need to your IT administrator, and most likely they will understand.
Creating a Project File
Whether you choose to use a single user or multiuser project fi le, it is important that you use 
one. Without a project fi le to confi gure Inventor’s search path, you are likely to create a fi le struc-
ture that will be problematic as you create more and more fi les in Inventor. 
Creating Single-User Projects
Probably the best way to learn about projects is to create a test single-user project. With single-
user projects, you can open, edit, and save fi les without checking the fi les in or out. In the 
following sections, you will investigate the single-user fi le project mode. Once you gain an 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

understanding of single-user projects, you will be ready to investigate the other project fi le 
types. To create a test project, you will use the Inventor Project Wizard.
The Inventor Project Wizard
To get the most out of this exercise, open your version of Inventor, ensure that you have closed 
all the open fi les, and then access the Inventor Project Wizard by clicking the Projects button on 
the Get Started tab. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Projects dialog box, click the New button at the bottom.
 
2. If you have installed Vault, you will see two options in the Inventor Project Wizard, as 
shown in Figure 1.25. If not, you will see only one option. In either case, select New Single 
User Project and then click Next.

When creating a new project, you can choose to include some, all, or none of the defi ned 
library locations. Click the Finish button to include no libraries at this point.

Switching and Editing Projects
Only one project can be active at a time. To switch projects, you must ﬁ rst close all ﬁ les that are 
open in Inventor. You cannot edit the ﬁ le paths of the active project, but you can edit items such as 
Content Center libraries that are included. You can edit anything in an inactive project.
The Projects Dialog Box
Now that you have created your sample project fi le, you’ll explore the options and settings avail-
able for your new project. To activate and use your new project, highlight the new project and 
click Apply. You can also activate or select a new project link by double-clicking the project link. 
Notice the check mark next to the project name MI_Test_Project, indicating that the project is 
now active, as shown in Figure 1.28.

Right-click a parameter group to view the settings available within that group. In the Project

Project types were discussed earlier in this chapter. The project location is a read-only param-
eter. Included fi les deserve some additional discussion because the Included File parameter 
allows you to apply a master project to your current project; this setting, as well as the other 
project settings, are discussed in the coming pages.
Included Files
Although it’s not required, you can include an existing project in the confi guration of the cur-
rent project by right-clicking Included File. The properties and settings in the project fi le that 
you attach override the settings in the current project fi le. This is useful for restricting and con-
trolling a user’s ability to change the project fi le. Also, if you frequently create new project fi les, 
you might consider creating a master project fi le that contains library locations and other set-
tings you commonly use and then including the master project fi le in each new project fi le.
Appearance Libraries
An appearance library is a collection of appearances (for instance, colors) that either are 
installed with Autodesk Inventor or are created by the user. User-created libraries can contain 
appearances and materials in the same appearance library. The Autodesk Appearance Library 
contains only appearances. The active library is shown in bold text.
Material Libraries
A material library is a collection of material defi nitions (for instance, physical materials such 
as Stainless Steel) that either are installed with Autodesk Inventor or are created by the user. 

CREATING A PROJECT FILE | 33
User-created libraries can contain materials and appearances in the same material library. The 
Autodesk Material Library contains only materials. The Inventor Material Library provides a 
basic set of manufacturing-related materials and appearances. The libraries that are installed 
with Autodesk products are read-only libraries. Custom libraries can be set to read-only or 
made writable using the fi le’s read-only attribute. The active library is shown in bold text.
Workspace
For single-user projects, the workspace is defi ned by the location of the project fi le (*.ipj). 
For Vault projects, the workspace is defi ned on the workstation and is confi gured to match the 
Working Folder setting in the Vault settings. The workspace is the folder that fi les are copied 
to when they are checked out. The Workspace folder may include any number of subfolders as 
required for your fi le management needs.
Workgroup
The workgroup search path specifi es a location outside the current project fi le paths where 
Inventor can search for existing fi les that are not included in a library. A workgroup is specifi ed 
when the project is created. Each single-user project should have no more than one workgroup. 
Using a workgroup path is not required and is not a common confi guration to make.
Style Library
Inventor uses styles to specify dimensions, text, colors, materials, and other properties. This is 
similar to styles used in AutoCAD. However, Inventor allows you to store styles locally within 
the templates or in an external style library that may be used with any project fi le.
The Use Style Library function in projects specifi es whether the project uses only local styles, 
local styles and the style library, or just local styles and a read-only version of the style library. 
The read-only style library is recommended for projects that have multiple users. With mul-
tiple users, changing or editing the style library on the fl y can cause downstream problems. To 
change the Use Style Library parameter, right-click and select the new setting.
Remember that for your projects, you can right-click to select another option when it is 
appropriate. Click Yes if you want to be able to edit styles in this project. Click Read-Only (the 
default) if you want to access style libraries and local styles without enabling style-editing capa-
bilities. Click No if you want to use only the styles located within the current fi le and project 
template. You can fi nd more on using style libraries toward the end of the chapter.
Library Options
Next on the list are libraries. Library folders are located outside the project fi le path. They may 
be located anywhere on your system or on your server. If you are sharing library fi les, you 
should place them on your server in a commonly accessed location. Inventor considers the con-
tents of directories specifi ed as libraries to be read-only.
In your newly created project fi le, you have not added any library folders. If at any time you 
want to add library folders, you can do so by right-clicking Libraries and choosing Add Path, 
Add Paths From File, or Paste Path, as shown in Figure 1.29.

34 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Figure 1.29
Adding library 
paths by 
right-clicking
You can manually add a path, either by browsing or by typing a new fi le location. Be sure 
to give the library a descriptive name that identifi es the contents of the fi le location. Add Paths 
From File permits you to extract library paths from another project fi le. Paste Path allows you to 
copy and paste. Once you have specifi ed library paths, the Delete Section Paths option becomes 
available, and you can remove paths not needed by the project. Deleting unused library paths 
reduces search and resolution time.
Shortcuts to Frequently Used Files
Frequently used subfolders are similar to the bookmarks you can set in Internet Explorer. The sub-
folders must already be nested within the current project workspace, workgroup, or library. Adding 
frequently used subfolders to your project provides navigation links in your open, save, and place 
dialog boxes so you can quickly navigate to those locations. In the Mastering Inventor 2015 project 
that you will use throughout the rest of this book, the chapter folders have been added as fre-
quently used subfolders.
Folder Options
The Folder Options setting allows your project to access other fi le locations that are specifi ed on 
the Files tab of the Application Options dialog box. Keep in mind that you may have to close and 
reopen Inventor in order to reinitialize the optional project fi le locations. You can use this option 
to specify different default locations for templates, design data, styles, and Content Center fi les. 
When the locations are set to the defaults, the location/storage of the fi les is specifi ed on the 
Files tab of the Application Options dialog box. Right-click any of the options entries to change 
the storage and access location. You can fi nd more information about design data, styles, and 
templates toward the end of this chapter and more about Content Center in Chapter 7, “Reusing 
Parts and Features.”
Project Options
Expand the Options heading to show the global defaults for the selected project. The Options 
settings in a project determine fi le management functions; right-click an option to edit it.

CREATING A PROJECT FILE | 35
Versioning and Backup
Use the Options settings to determine how many old versions or backup copies of each fi le 
to save. The Old Versions To Keep On Save option specifi es the number of versions to store in 
the Old Versions folder for each fi le saved. The fi rst time a fi le is saved in a project, an Old 
Versions folder for that fi le is created. When the fi le is saved, the prior version is moved automat-
ically to the fi le’s Old Versions folder. After the number of old versions reaches the maximum in 
the setting, the oldest version is deleted when a newer version is moved into the folder.
If you are familiar with AutoCAD, you may expect Inventor versioning to be similar to 
AutoCAD’s backup scheme. AutoCAD creates a *.bak fi le saved in the same folder as the 
design. Inventor saves the backup fi les in a separate Old Versions folder. All versions located in 
the Old Versions folder have the same name and extension, except that a number is appended 
after the name. In the project options, the default setting of 1 creates one backup fi le in the 
Old Versions folder. If you are working with a complex model, you might decide to specify 
additional backup versions by changing this setting to a higher number; however, remember 
that with each additional backup version you are creating additional fi les (and using additional 
space) on your hard drive. Setting Old Versions to −1 will cause Inventor to save all backup fi les.
Restoring an Old Version
Occasionally a ﬁ le may become corrupt, or you may have accidentally saved a design change that 
you did not intend to. In these cases, you can browse to the Old Versions folder and open the 
versioned ﬁ le. Upon doing so you will be presented with three options:
 
◆
Open Old Version (Save Not Allowed)
 
◆
Restore Old Version To Current Version
 
◆
Open Current Version
Filenaming Conventions
The Using Unique File Names setting in the options will allow Inventor to check for unique 
part names for all fi les in the project, including subfolders. Libraries are excluded in this option. 
Proper design workfl ow demands that each unique part have a unique fi lename. When a part is 
reused, you should ensure that any revision to it is acceptable to all designs in which it is used. 
If the revised part cannot be used in all of the designs, you should use a new part name because 
you have now created an additional unique part.
Setting the Using Unique File Names option to Yes will cause Inventor to search the entire 
project workspace to compare fi lenames but does not prevent users from creating duplicate 
fi lenames. Having this option set to Yes can cause issues when a large number of fi les are pres-
ent, particularly when those fi les are organized with a large number of subfolders. If the Using 
Unique File Names option is set to No, Inventor will not search to compare fi lenames.

36 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
The Using Unique File Names Setting and Slow Search Times
Consider the following scenario: Th e Using Unique File Names option for your project is set 
to Yes. You have an engineering directory with 8,500 folders and subfolders containing thou-
sands of ﬁ les. You have a drawing ﬁ le that references a part ﬁ le named 12–865.ipt, but you’ve 
renamed the part ﬁ le to 22–865.ipt using Windows Explorer.
Because the internal link in the drawing ﬁ le is still looking for 12–865.ipt, when you open the 
drawing ﬁ le that references the renamed part ﬁ le, Inventor will search through all of the 8,500 
folders and subfolders looking for the missing ﬁ le. When it doesn’t ﬁ nd the ﬁ le, it will ﬁ nally present 
the File Resolution dialog box, allowing you to point the drawing ﬁ le to 22–865.ipt.
Because of the number of folders and ﬁ les, this search may take several minutes. By contrast, if 
you had the same scenario but your project ﬁ le option Using Unique File Names was set to No, 
Inventor would not search for the missing ﬁ le. Instead, it would immediately present you with the 
File Resolution dialog box and allow you to point the drawing to 22–865.ipt right away. For this 
reason, you should set this option to No when large ﬁ le collections are present. However, even if it 
is set to No, you should employ a unique ﬁ lenaming scheme for all of your ﬁ les.
Keep in mind that you can toggle this option to Yes if you ﬁ nd yourself needing to search the 
project for unique ﬁ lenames.
If you do not have a part-numbering scheme already, take the time to implement one to 
make working with your Inventor fi les easier. Keep in mind that the most effective numbering 
schemes are often the simplest. Many an engineering department has eventually run into unan-
ticipated limitations when using a numbering scheme that is too specifi c or when attempting to 
include too much information in some built-in code. Here are a few suggestions that may help 
you in determining a numbering scheme that will work well for you:
Sequential Project-Based: 0910–00001  Here, the fi rst four digits correspond to the project 
number and the last fi ve are sequenced, starting at 00001. This numbering system works 
well when parts are not often used across different projects. Common parts might be created 
under a “common part project” prefi x such as 7777.
Generic Date-Based: 09–0707–01  Here, the fi rst six numbers are assigned by using the 
current date when the part number is created. In this example, the part number was created 
on July 7, 2009. The last two digits are sequenced starting with 01. This is a highly fl exible 
numbering system that allows 100 part numbers to be created per day. If more than 100 are 
needed, then backdating using an unused date can be done. The date itself holds no real sig-
nifi cance, other than helping to ensure the unique part numbers.
Sequential Product-Based: NG-00001  Here the fi rst two letters refl ect a specifi c product 
line, such as the Next Generation (NG) line, and the last fi ve are sequenced starting at 00001. 
This numbering system works well when products lines are engineered and maintained 
separately.
Once you’ve decided on a part numbering scheme, you will want to come up with a central 
part number log fi le or tracking system to be used in assigning numbers to ensure that there are 

CREATING A PROJECT FILE | 37
no duplicates. If you have a resource planning system (commonly referred to as a manufactur-
ing resource planning [MRP] or enterprise resource planning [ERP] system), you likely have the 
ability to manage part numbers using that software. If not, a simple XLS spreadsheet fi le can be 
used to assist with this task.
The Projects Dialog Box’s Tool Panel
The buttons along the right side of the lower pane of the Projects dialog box provide access to 
tools that allow you to add, edit, and reorder project parameter settings and paths; check for 
duplicate fi lenames; and confi gure Content Center libraries used for the active project.
Use the magnifying glass button located on the lower-right side of the Projects dialog box 
to check your project paths for duplicate fi lenames. Figure 1.30 shows the result of searching a 
project where someone has not been careful to ensure that duplicate fi lenames are not used.
Figure 1.30

Why Relative Paths?
An Inventor assembly ﬁ le records relative paths when it links a subassembly or single parts to itself. 
Th e use of relative paths in assembly ﬁ les allows the relocation of an assembly and its associated 
parts and subassemblies to other locations on servers or drives without requiring the resolution 
of a new location. Relative paths, however, introduce the danger of the assembly locating only the 
ﬁ rst of two parts that happen to have the same name. For instance, if you’ve saved ﬁ les named 
Part1 in two diﬀ erent ﬁ le folders, Inventor might resolve the link to the ﬁ rst one it ﬁ nds and then 
stop searching.
To prevent the possibility of the wrong part being loaded in an assembly, ensure that every part 
located in the search path has a unique name.
The Projects dialog box supports the confi guration of one or more Content Center libraries. 
Content Center provides multiple database libraries that can be used in assemblies or by the 
design accelerator.
If you elected to install Content Center libraries while installing Inventor, you must confi gure 
Content Center libraries in the project before you can access them. Click the Content Center but-
ton in the lower-right corner of the project editing dialog box. Then select Content Center library 
or libraries you want to use and click OK. Figure 1.31 shows the Confi gure Libraries dialog box.

38 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Figure 1.31
Conﬁ guring 
Content Center
Select Content Center libraries you think you’ll use. Installing all Content Center librar-
ies may slow your system down signifi cantly when you are accessing Content Center because 
Inventor will need to index each library upon initialization.
When you fi nish editing the project fi le, click Save and then make sure your desired project 
fi le is active before clicking Done to exit the Projects dialog box.
Creating Multiuser Projects
Working as a team can increase productivity many times over. In a collaborative design environ-
ment, several users may be working on a project at the same time. When you create a multiuser 
project, you have the option to choose Vault (if Vault is installed), shared, or semi-isolated project 
types. As stated earlier, Vault is similar to a semi-isolated project in how it works. It prevents you 
from working on the original version of a fi le located inside Vault. Each user creates a local Vault 
project fi le that specifi es a personal workspace located on the local drive and includes search 
paths to one or more master projects.
What Is Autodesk Vault and Who Needs It?
Autodesk Vault is a ﬁ le-management tool integrated with Inventor. Essentially, Vault allows you 
to check in and check out ﬁ les in a collaborative workgroup so users do not accidentally save over 
one another’s work. Not every design department needs to use Vault, and in fact many ﬁ nd that it 
is not a good solution for their particular needs. However, you should investigate Vault to see what 
it has to oﬀ er, even if you already have a data management system in place.
To edit a “Vaulted” fi le, the user must check the fi le out of Vault. The process of checking the 
fi le out copies the fi le to the local workspace. When someone checks out a fi le for editing, the 
original stored in Vault is fl agged as “checked out” to that particular user. Other users can view 
the checked-out fi les in read-only mode, but they can’t edit it.
The user who checked out the fi le can edit and save the fi le in their local workspace with-
out checking the fi le back into Vault. When they save the fi le, they will be prompted to choose 

UNDERSTANDING INVENTOR TEMPLATES | 39
whether they want to check the fi le back into Vault. If they choose to check the fi le into Vault, 
the fi le will be saved into Vault and is then available for editing by a different user. Optionally, 
they may save the fi le into Vault but keep it checked out to their local workspace, allowing other 
users to view the updated fi le without being able to edit it.
Project Shortcuts
If you right-click a project in the Project dialog box, you can choose Delete to remove it from the 
list. But if you browse to the ﬁ le location, you’ll see that the IPJ ﬁ le is still there. What is going on?
When you create a new project ﬁ le or point Inventor to an existing project ﬁ le, Inventor will create 
a shortcut to that ﬁ le. When you choose Delete and remove the project from the list, you are not 
actually deleting the IPJ ﬁ le but instead deleting the shortcut. When you choose Browse and locate 
the IPJ ﬁ le to add back to the list, the shortcut is re-created.
Th e path to the shortcuts can be set by accessing the Tools tab of the Ribbon menu and choosing 
Application Options. In the Application Options dialog box, click the Files tab and set the project’s 
folder path.
Collaborative design project fi les are created using the Inventor Project Wizard in much the 
same manner as a single-user project fi le is created. The fi le resolution process within a collab-
orative project fi le functions in the same way.
With Vault installed on your server or your own system, you can create and confi gure a Vault 
project. If Vault Explorer is not installed on your system, you cannot install or create a Vault 
project on your system. Before you create your fi rst Vault project, verify that Vault is correctly 
installed and that you can open and create a new Vault fi le store using the ADMS console. The 
new Vault fi le store must be accessible on your local system from Vault Explorer. If Vault func-
tions correctly, you are now ready to create a Vault project fi le. As with a single-user project, use 
the Inventor Project Wizard to name the project, specify the workspace, assign libraries for use 
with the project, and confi gure project parameters.
Again, as in other project fi le types, you will need to edit the default settings in your project 
fi le and optionally confi gure your Content Center for use.
Implementing Autodesk Vault
Once the Vault software is installed on your system, you can ﬁ nd the Autodesk Vault Implementation 
Guide in PDF in the Help folder of the install directory. Or you can search the Internet for autodesk+
vault+implementation+guide. Th is detailed guide provides you with information on Vault fundamen-
tals and installation as well as information on conﬁ guring and maintaining Autodesk Vault for your 
data management needs.
Understanding Inventor Templates
You can create template fi les in Inventor by opening an Inventor fi le, making the desired edits to 
the fi le, clicking the Inventor button, choosing Save Copy As, and then choosing Save Copy As 

40 | CHAPTER 1 GETTING STARTED
Template. It is typically recommended that you set the Template directory by confi guring your 
project fi le using the Folder Options node and setting the Template path to a network location. 
Often when creating a template, you might set up the following items in the fi le before saving:
 
◆
Custom iProperties
 
◆
User parameters
 
◆
Cached styles
 
◆
Specifi c document settings such as Units (by clicking the Document Settings button on the 
Tools tab)
When creating any template fi le, it is a good idea to work with a fi le that is as “clean” and 
uncluttered with extra styles as possible. The best way to do this is to hold down the Ctrl and 
Shift keys and click the New button; then select the type of fi le you want to create from the list, 
as shown in Figure 1.32.
Figure 1.32
Creating a new 
clean ﬁ le
Working with Styles, Style Libraries, and Company 
Standards
Your Inventor fi les will use a number of styles to allow you to maintain consistencies and to save 
you from needing to defi ne common setups over and over. In part fi les, the style collections 
include lighting styles, color styles, and material styles. Color and lighting styles allow you to 
change the appearance of your model, and material styles allow you to change its physical prop-
erties. In drawing fi les, style collections include such things as dimension styles, balloon styles, 
parts list styles, and much more. These drawing style collections are organized in standards, 
which are used to manage the standard company styles used within your organization. You can 
even have multiple standards set up, allowing you to change from one set of styles to another 
quickly and consistently.
Th e Bottom Line
Create parametric designs.  The power of parameter-based design comes from the quick 
and easy edits, when changing a parameter value drives a change through the design. To 
make changes easily, though, you need to follow certain general rules so that the changes 
update predictably.
Master It  You want to create a model of a base plate, a rectangular-shaped part with 
a series of holes and rectangular cutouts. What would your initial sketch look like in 
Inventor?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 41
Get the “feel” of Inventor.  The interface contains many elements that change and update 
to give you the tools you need to perform the task at hand. Getting comfortable with these 
automatic changes and learning to anticipate them will help you get the “feel” of Inventor.
Master It  You create an extrude feature using the Extrude button, but you cannot seem 
to fi nd an Edit Extrude button. How can you edit the extruded feature to change the 
height?
Use the Inventor graphical interface.  Inventor 2015 uses the Ribbon menu interface fi rst 
introduced in Inventor 2010. Tools are grouped, which makes fi nding them intuitive once you 
become familiar with the basic layout.
Master It  You are trying to draw a line on the face of a part, but you seem to have lost 
the Sketch tab in the ribbon. How do you get it back?
Work with Inventor fi le types.  Inventor supports many different fi le types in its native 
environment, separating tasks and fi les to improve performance and increase stability.
Master It  You have trouble keeping the various fi le types straight because all the fi le 
icons look rather similar to you. Is there a way you can see which fi le is what type?
Understand how project search paths work.  Knowing how Inventor resolves fi le paths 
when it opens linked fi les, such as assembly fi les and drawings, goes a long way toward help-
ing prevent broken links and repairing links that do get broken.
Master It  What type of fi le does Inventor use to point the assembly fi le to the parts that 
it contains?
Set up library and Content Center paths.  Library and Content Center paths are read-only 
library confi gurations set up in the project fi le.
Master It  When you set up a library or Content Center path to a folder that does not 
exist, what happens?
Create and confi gure a project fi le.  Project fi les are a key component of working success-
fully in Inventor, but for many people, this is a one-time setup. Once the project is created, for 
the most part you just use it as is.
Master It  After creating a project fi le initially, you want to make one or more changes to 
the confi guration, but you can’t seem to do so. What could b e the problem?
Determine the best project type for you.  Although the Autodesk solution to a multiuser 
environment is Autodesk Vault, many people may not be able to use Vault. For instance, if 
you use another CAD application that links fi les together like Inventor, Vault will likely not 
know how to manage the internal links for those fi les.
Master It  Because you generally do not work concurrently on the same fi les as your 
co-workers, you think it might be best to set up a single-user project for now while you 
continue to investigate the Vault solution, but you are not sure if that will work. Can 
single-user projects be used in this manner?


Chapter 2
A Hands-on Test-Drive of the 
Workﬂ ow
In this chapter you will explore the basic steps involved in creating part models, creating 
drawings of those parts, putting those parts together into an assembly model, and then creat-
ing a drawing of that assembly. At this point it is assumed that you have taken the time to read 
Chapter 1, “Getting Started,” and are familiar with the Autodesk® Inventor® software interface 
and navigation tools. If you have not done so, you might want to take the time to read that chap-
ter before continuing.
Although Inventor includes a number of tools that go far beyond the simple tasks of creating 
parts, drawings, and assemblies, the workfl ow involved in creating and detailing your designs 
is the foundation upon which you will build as you learn Inventor. The goal of this chapter is to 
get you familiar with the overall workfl ow. In the chapters to follow, you will explore the tools 
and environments in more depth.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

Creating a Part Model
Throughout this chapter you will be working toward creating the simple mechanism shown 
assembled in Figure 2.1.
Figure 2.1
An assembly

Inventor parts

44 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
To become familiar with this assembly, you can open the fi les mi_2a_180_Complete.jpg, 
mi_2a_180_Video.mov, or mi_2a_180_Video.mp4; all are located in the Chapter 02 directory 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder once you’ve downloaded this book’s companion 
fi les and created the folder structure Inventor expects for them, as described in the “Before You 
Start...” sidebar.
To create a model of a part, you will use an Inventor *.ipt fi le template. Once your new 
fi le is created, you will create basic profi les using sketching tools such as lines, arcs, and circles 
to defi ne the shape of the features that make up the part. You’ll also add dimensions and geo-
metric constraints to the sketch. You’ll then use the sketched profi les to create the 3D features 
that will defi ne the parts. Figure 2.2 shows the basic workfl ow involved in creating a part from 
sketches and features.

Before You Start…
Before you begin, make sure you have downloaded the tutorial ﬁ les from www.sybex.com/go
/masteringinventor2015. Place the ﬁ les in a folder on your computer (such as \My Documents\
Mastering Inventor 2015).
If you are using the Autodesk® Inventor LT™ program, the use of project ﬁ les does not apply, so 
you can skip the steps listed here. If you are using the full version of Inventor, follow these steps 
to set the Mastering Inventor 2015 project to be the active project:
 1. From within Inventor, close any open ﬁ les.
 2. From the Get Started tab, click the Projects button.
 3. From the Projects dialog, click the Browse button.
 4. From the Choose Project File dialog, browse to your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, select 
the Mastering Inventor 2015.ipj ﬁ le, and click Open.
 5. Note that the Mastering Inventor 2015 project is denoted as being the active project with a 
check mark.
 6. Click Done to close the Projects dialog box.
Now you are ready to get started with this book’s exercises.

CREATING A PART MODEL | 45
Starting with a Part Template
Inventor installs with several part templates that you can use to create your part fi les. In the 
following steps, you’ll use a millimeter-based part template to start your model.
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose New (or press Ctrl+N on the keyboard). Alternately, you 
can use the New button on the Home screen.
 
2. From the Create New File dialog box, expand the Templates folder (if required) and 
select the Metric folder from the list on the left.
 
3. Click Standard (mm).ipt from the list of part templates on the right side of the dialog 
box. Figure 2.3 shows the metric templates displayed in the Create New File dialog box.
Figure 2.3
Creating a ﬁ le 
from a metric part 
template
 
4. Click the Create button at the bottom of the dialog box to create a new fi le from the 
selected template.
Leave the fi le open and continue to the next section to create a base sketch in this new 
part fi le.
Understanding Origin Geometry
When you start a new fi le from a part template, the fi le contains some basic origin geometry 
located in the Origin folder. The Origin folder is found in the browser. Figure 2.4 shows a 
model of a screw with the Origin folder expanded and the origin geometry set to be visible. 
You can see the geometry browser nodes in the list on the left and the origin planes and axes 
displayed on the right as they run through the screw geometry.
Figure 2.4
Origin geometry 
in a part model

46 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
To create a base sketch for your part, you will use an origin plane to sketch on. Because origin 
geometry cannot be changed, using an origin plane to sketch on allows you to anchor your base 
sketch in space and provides a stable foundation upon which to create your part.
For a new fi le, the origin geometry is typically set to be invisible, but you can right-click any 
origin geometry and choose Visibility to make it appear. Right-clicking again and deselecting 
Visibility will toggle the origin feature’s visibility back off.
Creating a Base 2D Sketch
When you create a new part, Inventor will prompt you to select an origin plane on which to 
sketch, or it will create a new sketch for you on a designated origin plane. You can control this 
behavior by selecting the Tools tab and clicking the Application Options button. On the Part tab, 
you will fi nd the Sketch On New Part Creation option.
If this option is set to No New Sketch, Inventor will prompt you to select an origin plane to 
create your base sketch; otherwise, the base sketch will be created on the plane designated by 
this option automatically. Figure 2.5 shows the option for controlling the sketch behavior for 
new parts.
Figure 2.5
Setting the Sketch 
On New Part 
Creation option
In the following steps you will create a simple sketch to use as the base for your part. If the 
option for controlling the sketch behavior for new parts was set to use one of the origin planes 
automatically, then you can skip these steps.
 
1. From the 3D Model tab, select the Start 2D Sketch button.
Inventor will temporarily turn on the origin geometry and pause for you to select one of 
the planes to sketch on, as shown in Figure 2.6.
Figure 2.6
Selecting a plane 
to sketch on

CREATING A PART MODEL | 47
 
2. Expand the Origin folder in the browser and watch the selection highlight to select the 
XY origin plane to place your sketch on. Note that you can select an origin plane by click-
ing it in the browser or by selecting the edge of the plane in the graphics area.
Once you’ve selected a plane to sketch on, you will see a Sketch node created in the browser. 
The Sketch tab is now active and displays the sketch tools, as shown in Figure 2.7.
Figure 2.7

Active sketch tab and tools
Creating a Proﬁ le in the Sketch
Now that you have a sketch created and active for editing in your new part fi le, you will create a 
profi le to form the base feature of your part.
 
1. From the Create panel on the Sketch tab, click the Center Point Circle button.
You should see a dot in the center of your sketch; this is the projected origin center point 
of your part.
 
2. Click the dot to place your cursor on the origin center point so that the circle is centered 
and anchored to the origin of the part.
 
3. Enter Dia = 200 for the diameter of the circle, as shown in Figure 2.8.
Figure 2.8
Creating a 
sketched circle
Entering Dia = 200 does two things at once. Entering 200 defi nes the value of this dimen-
sion parameter. Preceding it with Dia = defi nes the name of the parameter, making it 
easier to recall later.
 
4. Press the Enter key to create the circle.

48 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
 
5. Right-click and choose OK or Cancel to exit the Circle tool.
 
6. From the Sketch tab, click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch environment.
Creating a Base 3D Feature
Next, you’ll use the circle in your sketch as the base profi le for the base 3D feature for this part.
 
1. From the 3D Model tab, click the Extrude button.
 
2. Enter 25 for the extrude distance.
Note that you can enter the value in the dialog box or in the mini-toolbar controls, and 
each will have the same result. You might need to click the black arrow to expand the 
Extrude dialog box in order to see the buttons within it.
 
3. Click the OK button (or the green check mark button) to create the extrude feature.
Notice that an extrusion feature has been created in the browser, and if you expand it, you’ll 
fi nd Sketch1, as shown in Figure 2.9.
Figure 2.9
Th e base 
extrusion
If you had the need to change or add something to Sketch1, you could do so by right-clicking 
Extrusion1 or Sketch1 in the browser and choosing Edit Sketch. Likewise, if you wanted to mod-
ify Extrusion1, you could right-click Extrusion1 and choose Edit Feature.
Creating a Secondary 2D Sketch
Next, you’ll create a new sketch on the top face of the extrusion you just created.
 
1. From the 3D Model tab, select the Start 2D Sketch button.
 
2. Click the top face of the extrusion to place the sketch.
 
3. From the Draw panel on the Sketch tab, click the fl yout arrow and then select the Two 
Point Center Rectangle tool, as shown in Figure 2.10.
 
4. Select the projected center point to place the rectangle.

CREATING A PART MODEL | 49
 
5. Enter Dia for the fi rst input and then press the Tab key on the keyboard. This will recall 
the value of the diameter dimension you created previously. 
By reusing the diameter parameter when creating the rectangle, you are linking the 
diameter and the width of the rectangle. This means that if you were to change the diam-
eter value at some point, the rectangle width will automatically adjust as well.
Figure 2.10

6. Enter 25 for the second input and then press the Enter key.
 
7. Right-click and choose OK or Cancel to exit the Rectangle tool.
 
8. Select the outer projected edge of the base feature (the circle) and then use the 
Construction button to toggle the line type to a dashed construction line.
This allows Inventor to ignore the circle as a profi le boundary in the steps to come. 
Figure 2.11 shows the circle being set to a construction line.
Figure 2.11

9. When your sketch looks like Figure 2.12, click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch 
environment.

Creating a Secondary 3D Feature
Next, you’ll cut a dovetailed slot from the part using the sketch created in the previous steps. If 
you did not complete the steps up to this point, you can open the fi le mi_2a_001.ipt, located in 
the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. From the 3D Model tab, click the Extrude button.
 
2. If needed, click the black arrow to expand the Extrude dialog box in order to see the but-
tons within it. Enter 10 for the extrude distance.
Recall that you can enter the value in the dialog box or in the mini-toolbar controls, and 
each will have the same result.
 
3. In the Extrude dialog box, click the Cut button to ensure that the rectangle is cut from the 
base feature (or set the Solution drop-down to Cut in the mini-toolbar controls).
 
4. Click the More tab in the dialog box and enter 12 for the taper distance.
 
5. Click the OK button (or the green check mark button) to create the extrude feature.
Notice that another extrusion feature for this dovetailed cut has been created in the browser; 
if you expand it, you’ll fi nd Sketch2, as shown in Figure 2.13.
Figure 2.13
Th e dovetail cut

CREATING A PART MODEL | 51
Patterning a 3D Feature
Next, you’ll pattern the dovetailed slot to create a second, cross slot. If you did not complete the 
steps up to this point, you can open the fi le mi_2a_002.ipt located in the Chapter 02 directory 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. From the 3D Model tab, fi nd the Pattern panel and click the Circular Pattern button.
 
2. For the Features selection, click Extrusion2 in the browser list.
 
3. Right-click and choose Continue to switch from the Features selection mode to the 
Rotations Axis selection mode (or you can click the red arrow in the dialog box).
 
4. Click the outer face of the part to use the cylindrical surface as the rotation axis.
 
5. Enter 2 for the count.
 
6. Enter 90 for the angle.
Figure 2.14 shows the Circular Pattern dialog box at this point.
Figure 2.14

dovetail slot
 
7. Click the OK button to create the pattern feature.
This concludes the creation of this basic part model. Although this model is somewhat sim-
ple, it demonstrates the workfl ow used to create much more complex part models. Keep in mind 
that for the majority of the part models you will use this workfl ow:
 
1. Create a new fi le using an Inventor *.ipt fi le template.
 
2. Create basic profi les using sketch tools to defi ne the shape of the features that make up 
the part.
 
3. Use the sketched profi les to create the 3D features that will defi ne the parts.

52 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
Explore Design Iterations Using Save Copy As
Often when you are designing a part ﬁ le, you might come to a point in your design at which you 
want to explore a design idea, without altering your current design. You can do this in Inventor by 
using the Save Copy As option to save a reserved copy of your current work while still continuing 
to work on the current ﬁ le. 
Th e steps to use the Save Copy As option are described here:
 1. Click the Inventor button located at the top left of the screen.
 2. From the drop-down menu, select Save As.
 3. From the Save As ﬂ yout menu, select Save Copy As.
 4. Name the ﬁ le with a name that represents the stage of the design, such as mi_2a_002_without 
holes.ipt.
Creating and Detailing Drawings of Part Models
In this section you’ll open an existing drawing and create views of a part model and then add 
dimensions and annotations. In the real world, often you’ll use a drawing template to create a 
new drawing, much as you did with the part model template. Other times, you will be editing 
existing drawings just as you will be doing in these steps.
Creating a Base View on a Drawing
In Inventor, drawing views are created by referencing model fi les. In the following steps, you’ll 
open a part model and then create a view of it on an existing drawing:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the part fi le mi_2a_004.ipt in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
If you’d like, spin the part around and take a look at it using the ViewCube® or the Orbit 
tool. Note that this is basically the same part created earlier in this chapter, with a couple 
of modifi cations. Do not close the part; you will want to have it open in the upcoming 
steps. 
 
3. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button, browse for the drawing fi le mi_2a_004.idw 
in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and click Open.
This is a drawing fi le that has been created using rather poor techniques. In the following 
steps, you’ll clean up this fi le and create views of the same part fi le but with much better 
results.

CREATING AND DETAILING DRAWINGS OF PART MODELS | 53
 
4. Hover your cursor over the part on the drawing sheet, and you will see a dotted outline 
of the view.
 
5. Right-click the dotted view border and choose Delete; then click the OK button to confi rm 
that you want to delete the view.
 
6. On the Place Views tab, click the Base button to create a base view.
 
7. With the Drawing View dialog box open, move your mouse pointer around on the 
drawing, and you will see a dynamic preview of the part fi le that you opened earlier. 
Do not click the screen just yet or you will inadvertently place the drawing view.
Note that all open model fi les are listed in the File drop-down list. You can select any 
open model fi le from the list or click the Browse button to select another fi le.
 
8. In the Scale fi eld, enter 0.5, as shown in Figure 2.15, or use the drop-down list to 
select 1/2.
Figure 2.15
Base View options
 
9. In the Orientation pane on the right, click through the available options and watch the 
preview at your mouse pointer change. Select Top when you’ve fi nished.
 
10. In the Style area, click just the middle button to create an unshaded view with no hidden 
lines.
 
11. Uncheck the Create Projected Views Immediately After Base View Creation check box, 
found in the lower-left corner.
 
12. Click anywhere on the page to create the view (or click the OK button).
 
13. Hover your cursor over the view until you see a dotted outline of the view; then click and 
drag it to move the view to the lower left of the page so that it fi ts well.
Figure 2.16 shows the drawing with the base view.

54 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
Figure 2.16
A well-placed 
base view
Creating Projected Views on a Drawing
Next, you’ll use the base view you created to project other views onto the page. If you did not 
complete the previous steps, you can open the fi le mi_2a_005.idw located in the Chapter 02 
directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. On the Place Views tab, click the Projected button to create views projected from the 
base view.
 
2. Click the base view on the drawing sheet.
 
3. As you drag your mouse pointer around the base view, notice the view previews that are 
being generated.
 
4. Drag straight to the right and click. You will see a rectangular bounding box, indicating 
that a view will be placed there.
 
5. Drag diagonally up and to the right from the base view (toward the top-right corner of 
the page) and click.
 
6. Right-click and choose Create to generate the projected views.
 
7. Select the view border (dashed bounding box) of the top-right view; then right-click and 
choose Edit View.
 
8. In the Style area at the bottom right of the dialog box, click just the blue button on the 
right to shade the view and then click the OK button.
Figure 2.17 shows the drawing with the additional projected views.

CREATING AND DETAILING DRAWINGS OF PART MODELS | 55
Figure 2.17
Projected views
Creating Dimensions on a Drawing
Next, you’ll add dimensions to the views. If you did not complete the previous steps, you can 
open the fi le mi_2a_006.idw located in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
1. Switch from the Place Views tab to the Annotate tab and then click the Dimension button.
 
2. Click any of the circular edges around the perimeter of the base view.
 
3. Move your cursor to the outside of the part.
Note that Inventor will give you a radius dimension if you select an arc edge, and it will 
default to a diameter dimension if you happen to select an edge that is a circle. Often, 
edges in views overlap, making it diffi cult to predict whether the selection will return a 
radius or a diameter. To deal with this, you can right-click and switch the result.
 
4. With the dimension still previewing at your cursor, right-click and choose Dimension 
Type; notice the various dimension types you can place with the current selection.
 
5. Choose Diameter as the type and then click on-screen to place the dimension (if the Edit 
Dimension dialog box appears, you can just click OK without making any edits).
 
6. Note that the Dimension tool is still active. Click the line on the left side of the dovetailed 
slot (make sure you’re not clicking the green midpoint dot), and notice that the results 
display the length of the selected line.

56 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
 
7. Click the line on the right side of the dovetailed slot, and notice that the results display 
the distance between the two selected lines, as shown in Figure 2.18. You can click the 
drawing sheet to place the dimension.
Figure 2.18
Placing 
dimensions
You can continue experimenting with the Dimension tool if you’d like, or you can move on 
to the next section and take a look at assemblies. Keep in mind that there is an entire chapter of 
this book devoted to the topic of creating and dimensioning drawing views, but this section 
ideally gave you an idea of the workfl ow used in Inventor to create drawings from models.
Putting Part Models Together in Assembly Files
In this section, you will explore the workfl ow used to create assembly models. Assembly fi les 
start out as empty container fi les, into which you place your part models. Once the parts are 
placed, you can begin to assemble them using what are known as Assembly constraints. Assembly 
constraints are simply relationships between the geometry of different parts.
In the next set of steps, you will assemble a simple mechanism composed of just a handful of 
parts. You can open the fi les mi_2a_180_Complete.jpg, mi_2a_180_Video.mov, or mi_2a_180_
Video.mp4 in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to have 
another look at the fi nal assembly in action.
Inventor LT and Assembly Files
If you are using Inventor LT, you will not have the ability to create assembly ﬁ les with your ver-
sion. If you ﬁ nd that you need to assemble part ﬁ les, you might look into upgrading to the full 
version of Inventor.
Placing, Rotating, and Moving Parts in an Assembly File
In the next set of steps, you will open an assembly fi le and place a part in it. Then you will rotate 
and move the free-fl oating or unconstrained parts around in the assembly. As you’ll see, when 
parts are placed into an assembly, they are initially free to move and rotate in all directions.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the assembly fi le mi_2a_190.iam in the Chapter 02 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
This assembly fi le was created from an assembly template much like the part template 
you used at the beginning of this chapter. Most of the parts have been placed into 

PUTTING PART MODELS TOGETHER IN ASSEMBLY FILES | 57
the assembly. However, there is one more part that needs to be placed, and you will 
do this next. Once the part is added, you will take a few moments to rotate and move 
parts around the assembly.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Place button (or right-click in the graphics area and 
choose Place Component).
 
4. Browse for the part fi le mi_2a_183.ipt in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder, and click Open.
 
5. Click in the graphics area to place the part into the assembly.
 
6. Note that you have the opportunity to place another instance of the same part. In this 
case, though, you will right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Place Component tool.
 
7. Notice that the components are listed in the browser. Take a moment to click the various 
components, and notice that when selected in the graphics area, the component is high-
lighted in the browser. When selected in the browser, it is highlighted in the graphics 
area. To deselect components, you can just click an empty space. 
Turning On a Missing Model Browser
Although it isn’t common to need to turn the Model browser oﬀ , you can do so. More commonly, 
you may accidentally turn it oﬀ  by clicking the X button on the right side of the browser title 
bar. To display it again, from the View tab click the User Interface button on the Windows panel. 
You’ll most likely want to have all the items in this list selected except for possibly the iLogic 
Browser and the Eco Materials Adviser. 
 
8. Click the Free Rotate button found on the Position panel of the Assemble tab (or press G 
on the keyboard).
 
9. Click any of the parts other than the large, round base part to select a part for rotating.
 
10. Click and drag in the center of the rotate “target” to orbit the part around.
 
11. Click and drag the outside of the rotate “target” to rotate the part around.
 
12. Click and drag one of the horizontal or vertical lines on the rotate “target” to rotate the 
part on that axis.
 
13. Click another part to set it active for rotating.
 
14. Click anywhere in the graphics area that is not on a part to exit the Free Rotate tool.
 
15. Next, click and drag any of the parts, other than the large round base part, to move 
the part. 
Note that the large, round base part cannot be rotated or moved because it is grounded 
in place. If you right-click it and deselect Grounded, it will be available to rotate and move. 
However, it’s always best to have one base part that is grounded in place to provide a stable 
foundation on which to build your assembly.

58 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
Editing a Component by Accident
If you happen to accidentally double-click a component from within an assembly ﬁ le, Inventor will 
switch from the assembly environment to the part-editing environment. You’ll be able to see that 
you’ve done this when the browser shows the other components grayed out, and the 3D Model tools 
are displayed in the Ribbon menu. To exit the part-editing environment and return to the assembly 
environment, you can right-click and choose Finish Edit, or you can use the Return button on the 
far right of the 3D Model tab.
As you’ve seen, when parts are placed into an assembly, they are initially free to move and 
rotate in all directions. This ability to move is referred to as the parts’ degrees of freedom. Your 
goal when creating assemblies is to remove these degrees of freedom until your assembly 
behaves as designed. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next 
section, where you will put the parts together.
Working with Degrees of Freedom in an Assembly
As you saw in the previous section, parts are initially free to move and rotate when placed into 
an assembly. Next, you’ll open another version of the assembly fi le and examine the behavior of 
a partially constrained part.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the assembly fi le mi_2a_191.iam in the Chapter 02 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. Click and drag the screw, and notice that it can move freely.
However, you’ll notice that the round base part cannot move. This is because it is 
grounded in place. To help better visualize how underconstrained parts can move, you 
can turn on the degrees of freedom (DOF) icons.
 
4. From the View tab, click the Degrees Of Freedom button.
You’ll notice that arrows and other icons are overlaid on the screw. These are the DOF 
indicators and are displayed to show you the remaining degrees of freedom present. 
Figure 2.19 shows the screw with all of its DOF icons displayed. This part can move in the 
x-, y-, or z-axis and can rotate around all those axes as well.
Figure 2.19
Six degrees of 
freedom
In Figure 2.20 the part has only two remaining degrees of freedom because it has been con-
strained to a hole. It has the ability to move in one axis and rotate around that same axis. 

PUTTING PART MODELS TOGETHER IN ASSEMBLY FILES | 59
This is because the centerline of the part and the centerline of the hole have been constrained 
together.
Figure 2.20
Two degrees of 
freedom
Next, you’ll place an Assembly constraint to insert the unconstrained screw into the hole 
on the large base part.
 
5. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or press C on the keyboard).
 
6. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, select the Mate button (hover your 
cursor over the buttons to see their names).
 
7. Select the cylindrical face of the screw shaft for Selection 1. Notice that the highlight 
shows that the centerline is selected.
 
8. Select the cylindrical face of the hole on the large round base part for Selection 2.
 
9. Click the OK button in the Place Constraint dialog box to create the Mate constraint.
 
10. In the browser, expand the browser nodes for either of the parts, and you will see the 
Mate constraint you just placed listed under it.
Notice that all but two of the DOF arrow icons have been removed from the screw part in the 
graphics area, and the remaining icons indicate that the screw is free to rotate in the hole and 
slide in and out of the hole. You can click and drag the screw to confi rm this.
Constraining parts to remove degrees of freedom is the way you assemble parts in an assem-
bly fi le. If the goal is to create a mechanism that moves in a predictable manner, you will leave 
some degrees of freedom unconstrained so that those parts can still move. You can close this fi le 
and continue to explore this idea further.
Placing Assembly Constraints to Deﬁ ne Mechanical Movement
In this section you will place Assembly constraints between parts within an assembly fi le. Your 
goal is to constrain the parts in a way that allows the assembled mechanism to operate as it does 
in the video fi le (see mi_2a_180_Video.mov or mi_2a_180_Video.mp4).
Using Mate Constraints to Create Sliding Bearings
In the following steps you place Mate constraints on square bearings and the base part to create a 
sliding motion for the bearings:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the assembly fi le mi_2a_192.iam in the Chapter 02 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.

60 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
 
3. Select the View tab; then click the Degrees Of Freedom button to turn on the degrees of 
freedom triad for each part that is not grounded or fully constrained.
 
4. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or press C on the keyboard).
 
5. In the Place Constraint dialog box, ensure that the Assembly tab is active and the Mate 
button is selected for the type. Make sure the Preview check box is selected and the 
Predict Offset And Orientation check box is cleared.
Here is an explanation of these two options:
Predict Offset And Orientation  This button measures the distance between the select-
ed faces, allowing you to eyeball a part placement and then retrieve the distance. If the 
check box is not selected, a default of 0 is entered for the offset.
Preview  This check box, denoted by the eyeglasses icon, controls whether the selected 
components will adjust position or orientation so you can review the constraint before 
clicking Apply or OK to actually create it.
 
6. For Selection 1, click the blue face on one of the square bearings. Watch the on-screen 
highlights to be sure you select the face and not an edge. It may be helpful to zoom in.
 
7. For Selection 2, click anywhere on the blue x-shaped face of the base part, as shown in 
Figure 2.21.
Figure 2.21
Mate constraint 
selections
You should see the part “snap” into place based on your selection points. This is just 
a preview of the constraint and is controlled by the Preview check box. To place the 
constraint, you need to click the Apply or OK button. Clicking the Apply button places 
the constraint and then leaves the dialog box open so you can place another constraint, 
whereas clicking the OK button places the constraint and then closes the dialog box.
 
8. Click Apply to place the Mate constraint between the two parts.
 
9. Place another Mate constraint using the tapered side face of the x-shaped slot feature and 
the tapered side face of the same bearing part.

PUTTING PART MODELS TOGETHER IN ASSEMBLY FILES | 61
The selection order is not important, but be sure you are selecting faces and not edges, 
because edges will give you a different result. It might help to zoom in to select the faces. 
Recall that you can use the wheel button on your mouse to zoom in and out. Figure 2.22 
shows the faces to be selected.
Figure 2.22
Tapered face 
selections for 
the second Mate 
constraint
 
10. Once your selections are made, click the OK button to place the constraint and close the 
dialog box.
 
11. Click and drag on the bearing part to see it slide in the groove.
Notice too that the DOF icons for the bearing have changed to indicate that it can move in 
only one axis now.
 
12. Apply two more Mate constraints to the other bearing part so that it will slide in the other 
cross groove.
You can open the fi le mi_2a_193.iam to see the assembly completed at this stage and com-
pare it to yours.
Using Insert Constraints to Fasten Parts Together
Next, you’ll constrain the remainder of the assembly using the Insert constraint. An Insert con-
straint places a mate between a center axis and a circular edge all at once, and it’s ideal when 
you are constraining fasteners and other cylinder-shaped parts to holes.
You can continue using mi_2a_192.iam from the previous steps or close it and open 
mi_2a_193.iam in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. Select the View tab; then click the Degrees Of Freedom button to turn on the degrees of 
freedom triad for each part that is not grounded or fully constrained.
 
2. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or press C on the keyboard).
 
3. In the Place Constraint dialog box, ensure that the Assembly tab is active and then click 
the Insert button for the type. Make sure the Preview check box is selected and the 
Predict Offset And Orientation check box is cleared.

62 | CHAPTER 2 A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW
 
4. For Selection 1, click the circular edge of one of the bearings, as shown in Figure 2.23.
Figure 2.23
Selection 1 for the 
Insert constraint
 
5. For Selection 2, click the circular edge of one end of the oblong link, as shown in 
Figure 2.24.
Figure 2.24
Selection 2 for the 
Insert constraint
 
6. Click Apply to place the Insert constraint between the two parts.
 
7. Place another Insert constraint using the circular edge on the other bearing and the bot-
tom edge of the oblong link.
Note that because the hole is concentric to the round end of the link, this selection is the 
same as the circular edge of the hole. Figure 2.25 shows the edges to be selected.
 
8. Once the second insert is placed, exit the Place Constraint dialog box, and test the 
motions of the assembly by clicking and dragging the green dot in the center of the 
oblong link and “tracing” the outer circular edge of the large, round base part.

CREATING AND DETAILING DRAWINGS OF ASSEMBLY MODELS | 63
To complete the assembly, place an Insert constraint between the fl at washers and the holes 
on the top of the oblong link and then place Insert constraints between the bottom edge of 
the screw heads and the top of the fl at washers. When you’ve fi nished, you can open the fi le 
mi_2a_194.iam in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to com-
pare it to your results. Then you can close all the fi les you have open and continue to the next 
section to explore the tools used to document assemblies in the 2D drawing environment.
Creating and Detailing Drawings of Assembly Models
In this section, you’ll open an existing drawing and add a detail view to the sheet. Then you’ll 
use the annotation tools to place a parts list and part number balloons in the drawing. Finally, 
you’ll export the fi nished drawing as a PDF fi le so that it can be shared with people who do not 
have Inventor.
Inventor LT and Assembly Files
If you are using Inventor LT, you will not have the ability to create drawings of assembly ﬁ les 
with your version. If you ﬁ nd that you need to create and detail assembly models, you might look 
into upgrading to the full version of Inventor.
Creating an Assembly Detail View
In the following steps, you’ll open a drawing that contains a single base view of an assembly 
model. You’ll create a detail view by referencing the existing base view.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the drawing fi le mi_2a_195.idw in the Chapter 02 directory of the 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. On the Place Views tab, click the Detail button.
 
4. Click anywhere on the existing base view to use it as the basis of the new detail view. 
This will open the Detail View dialog box.
In the Detail View dialog box, the View/Scale Label And Style settings can be adjusted as 
needed.
 
5. Set the Scale to 1:1.
 
6. Next, you’ll create the detail boundary by clicking the existing base view. To do so, click the 
base view approximately in the center of the screw on the right, as shown in Figure 2.26.
 
7. Drag the boundary out to a size close to that shown in Figure 2.26 as well. The goal is to 
encircle the screw, the washer, and the yellow bearing.
 
8. Click the screen to set the boundary size.

9. Move your cursor to the top left of the drawing and click the screen where you would 
like to place the detail view.
 
10. Click the detail boundary on the base view, and note the six green grips. Click and drag 
any of the outer grips to resize the boundary, and use the center one to control the loca-
tion. Make adjustments as needed to center the boundary on the area of detail.
 
11. Hover your cursor over the detail view on the page, and you will see a dotted outline of 
the view. Click and drag this border to adjust the placement of the detail view.
 
12. Click and drag the label text for the detail view (it will likely read “Detail A”) to move 
it up.
Figure 2.27 shows the detail view placed on the sheet.

CREATING AND DETAILING DRAWINGS OF ASSEMBLY MODELS | 65
You can experiment with moving and resizing the detail boundary on the base view, and 
notice that it will automatically update the detail view. In the next section, you’ll add a parts list 
to the drawing.
Placing a Parts List and Balloons
Next, you’ll create a parts list table in the upper-right corner of the drawing and then add callout 
balloons. You can continue using the drawing you have open or open the fi le mi_2a_196.idw 
located in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. Switch from the Place Views tab to the Annotate tab and click the Parts List button (it’s 
toward the right, on the Table panel).
 
2. Click either the base view or the detail on the sheet to point the parts list to the 
assembly fi le.
 
3. Click the OK button and then snap the parts list to the top-right corner of the drawing 
border.
 
4. On the Annotate tab, click the Balloon button.
 
5. In the base view, select the edge of the large, round base part and drag out; click once to 
place the balloon on the sheet, right-click, and choose Continue.
 
6. Repeat step 5 for each part in the detail view and then right-click again and choose 
Cancel to exit the Balloon tool.
You can click the balloons to adjust the placement of the balloon end or the arrowhead end if 
needed. Figure 2.28 shows the balloon placement.

placement, you can continue to the next section to explore the steps used to export the drawing 
as a PDF fi le so that it can be emailed and viewed by others who do not have Inventor.
Exporting a Drawing to a PDF File
In the following steps, you can use the drawing fi le you have been working on, or you can open 
the fi le mi_2a_197.idw in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
1. Click the Inventor button located at the top left of the screen.
 
2. From the drop-down menu, select Export.
 
3. From the Export fl yout menu, select PDF.
 
4. Name the fi le as you like and then click the Options button.
 
5. Select the Remove Object Line Weights option and set the Vector Resolution to 600 DPI.
Note that if the drawing happened to have multiple sheets, this is where you’d choose to 
include all of the sheets in one PDF fi le.
 
6. Click the OK button in the PDF Drawing dialog box and then click the Save button to 
create the PDF in the Chapter 02 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
Review the PDF fi le, or open the fi le mi_2a_199.pdf located in the Chapter 02 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to see the result of the PDF export.
Th e Bottom Line
Create a part model.  The process of creating a part model starts with an *.ipt template 
fi le. Once you’ve started a part model from a template, you create sketches to defi ne feature 
profi les, and then you make those profi les into 3D features using one of the 3D modeling fea-
ture tools.
Master It  You created a base 3D feature for your parts by extruding a sketch profi le at 
a distance of 15 mm. Then you created other sketches on the top face of the base feature. 
However, you now realize that the base feature should have been 25 mm thick. Can the 
base feature be changed after you’ve created other features on it?
Create and detail drawings of part models.  The process of creating a drawing fi le starts 
with an *.idw template fi le. Once you’ve started a drawing from a template, you create views 
of a referenced part model fi le. After the views are created, you can add dimensions and 
other annotations to the view.
Master It  You’ve created a drawing of a part model and then realize that you need to 
make a change to that model. How will the change to the part model be handled by the 
drawing fi le?
Put part models together in assembly fi les.  The process of creating an assembly model 
starts with an *.iam template fi le. Once you’ve started an assembly model from a template, 
you place part model fi les into the assembly and then use Assembly constraints to arrange 
and assemble the part models.

Chapter 3
Sketch Techniques
This chapter will cover the principles of creating parametric sketches used in part modeling 
within the Autodesk® Inventor® and Autodesk® Inventor LT™ programs. All the skills discussed 
in this chapter are based primarily on creating a single part, whether in a single-part fi le or in 
the context of an assembly fi le.
Inventor utilizes two types of sketches: a 2D sketch and a 3D sketch. A 2D sketch is created 
on any geometry plane and is the more common of the two types. A 3D sketch is not limited to 
a sketch plane and can comprise geometry in any point in space. 3D sketches are often created 
from existing geometry. Both 2D and 3D sketches are controlled by two basic parameter types: 
dimensions and sketch constraints.
In Inventor, sketches are generally “roughed out” with basic geometry and sketch constraints 
fi rst and then fully defi ned with dimensions that drive the geometry.
The dimensions dictate the length, size, and angle of the sketch geometry. For the dimen-
sions to do this predictably, sketch objects must know how to interact with one another. This 
interaction is defi ned by the sketch constraints. This chapter will cover how to create part fea-
tures using basic 2D and 3D sketches, including the tools and settings that govern their creation. 
Also covered is how to use Autodesk® AutoCAD® data to create sketches.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Set up options and settings for the sketch environment
 
◆
Create a sketch from a part fi le template
 
◆
Use sketch constraints to control sketch geometry
 
◆
Master general sketch tools
 
◆
Create sketches from AutoCAD geometry
 
◆
Use 3D sketch tools
Exploring the Options and Settings for Sketches
Before you jump into creating a part sketch, take a look at the options and settings Inventor 
provides for sketches. Options and settings in part fi les are located in two different areas of 
Inventor, depending on whether the focus of these settings affects the application (Inventor) or 
the document (your part fi le). You’ll look at both application options and document options in 
the following sections.

70 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 3 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/mastering
inventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the 
download and setup instructions.
Application Options
In this section you’ll explore the options and settings found in the application options collection. 
Application options change settings for your installation of Inventor. You can adjust the applica-
tion settings as follows:
 
1. From the Tools tab, click the Application Options button.
 
2. Choose the Sketch tab, as shown in Figure 3.1.
Figure 3.1
Sketch tab of 
Application 
Options 
dialog box
The application options on the Sketch tab are as follows:
Constraint Settings Area  The options in this section determine the method and options 
involved in creating and managing 2D sketch constraints. When you click the Settings but-
tons, you are presented with the Constraint Settings dialog box. Note that the constraint set-
tings can also be accessed by selecting the Constraint Settings button on the Constrain panel 
of the Sketch tab. There are three tabs found in this dialog box:

EXPLORING THE OPTIONS AND SETTINGS FOR SKETCHES | 71
General  Use these options to set default display and behaviors for sketch constraints 
and dimensions. Figure 3.2 shows the General settings tab.
Figure 3.2
Constraint set-
tings dialog box
Inference  Use these options to set default behaviors for inferred or automatically placed 
sketch constraints. Figure 3.3 shows the sketch inference settings.
Figure 3.3
Sketch inference 
settings
Relax Mode  With the Enable Relax Mode options selected, confl icting sketch con-
straints are removed when you add new constraints or dimensions. Essentially this 
allows the last constraint placed to “win” in instances where placing a new sketch con-
straint confl icts with an existing sketch constraint. Figure 3.4 shows the Relax Mode tab 
settings.

72 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Figure 3.4
Constraint 
relax mode
Display Area  Located in the upper-right portion of the Sketch tab, this area gives you set-
tings for grid lines, minor grid lines, axes, and a 2D coordinate system indicator. All of these 
options set different visual references in the form of grid lines and coordinate indicators. You 
can experiment with these settings by deselecting the box next to each option and clicking 
the Apply button while in sketch mode.
Spline Fit Method Area  This determines the initial type of transition for a spline between 
fi t points. Figure 3.5 shows two splines drawn with the same input points. On the left, the 
standard spline solution is in bold with the AutoCAD solution dashed; on the right, the stan-
dard solution is dashed with the AutoCAD solution in bold.
Figure 3.5
Standard spline 
ﬁ t (left) and 
AutoCAD spline 
ﬁ t (right)
Standard  Creates a spline with a smooth continuity (G3 minimum) between points. 
This spline type tends to overshoot at sharp transitions. Use this for Class A surfaces 
such as automotive design.
AutoCAD  Creates a spline using the AutoCAD fi t method (G2 minimum). This is not 
used for Class A surfaces.
Minimum Energy  Sets the fi t method to create a spline with smooth continuity (G3 
minimum) and good curvature distribution. Multiple internal points are used between 
fi t points, resulting in a nice, heavy curvature. This can also be used for Class A surfaces, 
but it takes the longest to calculate and creates the largest fi le size.

EXPLORING THE OPTIONS AND SETTINGS FOR SKETCHES | 73
About Curve Classification
Curves are classiﬁ ed by how smooth the continuity is where they connect to one another. Th is 
classiﬁ cation is as follows:
 
◆
G0 controls the position at which curves touch one another.
 
◆
G1 controls the tangent angle at which curves connect.
 
◆
G2 controls the radius at which curves connect.
 
◆
G3 controls the acceleration or rate of change of curves.
Snap To Grid Check Box  This allows your mouse pointer to snap to a predefi ned grid 
spacing. The grid spacing is controlled per fi le in the document settings, as will be discussed 
in the coming pages.
Autoproject Edges During Curve Creation Check Box  This allows you to reference exist-
ing geometry from your sketch plane and have that geometry automatically included in your 
sketch. For example, if you sketch on the top face of a part that has a hole on the bottom face, 
you might want to fi nd the center of the hole to reference in your sketch, but since that hole 
exists on a different plane, it needs to be projected up into your current sketch before you can 
do so. Enabling this option allows you to “rub” your mouse over the hole and have it auto-
matically projected into your sketch. Figure 3.6 shows a line being sketched from the middle 
of the cylinder to the center of a hole on the bottom face. With this option on, simply rubbing 
the edge of the hole will project it to the top face so that the line can be sketched to the center 
of the projected circle. This option can be toggled on and off by selecting AutoProject in the 
context menu of most of your sketch tools, such as Line, Circle, Arc, and so on.
Figure 3.6

hole edge while 
sketching on the 
top face
Autoproject Edges For Sketch Creation And Edit Check Box  This automatically projects 
the edges of the face when you create a sketch on it. Although this ability can be convenient 
in some cases, it can also become counterproductive because it places extra line work into 
your sketches. This can add a level of complexity to your sketches that is not required. 
Figure 3.7 shows the results of selecting this option on the left and of having this option 
unselected on the right.

Creation And Edit 
check box
Look At Sketch Plane On Sketch Creation Check Box  This reorients the graphics window 
so that your view is always perpendicular to the sketch plan while you are creating or 
editing a sketch.
Autoproject Part Origin On Sketch Create Check Box  This automatically projects the 
part’s origin center point whenever a new sketch is created. The origin center point is 
point 0 in the X, Y, and Z directions. Projection of this point makes it easy to constrain 
and anchor your sketch. If this option is not selected, you are required to manually project 
this point.
Point Alignment On Check Box  This allows endpoints and midpoints to be inferred by 
displaying temporary, dotted lines to assist in lining up sketch entities. Figure 3.8 shows an 
endpoint being located using the Point Alignment On option.
Figure 3.8
Point align-
ment inferring

Enable Heads-Up Display (HUD) Check Box  This allows you to input numeric and angu-
lar values directly into input boxes when creating sketch entities. For instance, if you were 
to sketch a circle without HUD on, you’d rough in the approximate size and then use the 
Dimension tool to give the circle an exact diameter. With HUD, you can specify the diameter 
as you create the circle. Clicking the Settings button opens the Heads-Up Display Settings 
dialog box, where you can adjust the HUD settings.
Auto-Bend With 3D Line Creation Check Box  This allows corners to be automatically 
rounded when you’re creating a 3D sketch. This feature can be turned on and off via the con-
text menu when using the Line tool in a 3D sketch. Figure 3.9 shows corners created without 
the auto-bend feature enabled. The default auto-bend radius size is set per fi le via the docu-
ment settings but can be edited once the bends are created.
To set changes made to the application options, you can click the Apply button. You can 
save the changes you make to the application options for backup or distribution among other 
users by clicking the Export button at the bottom of the Application Options dialog box. In the

Document Settings
In addition to the previous settings, which are set application-wide, there are settings that con-
trol options per fi le. Document settings vary depending on the fi le type you are in. For part fi les, 
you can modify the sketch settings by clicking the Document Settings button on the Tools tab of 
the Ribbon menu while you are in an open part fi le. Once the Document Settings dialog box is 
open, click the Sketch tab to access the following settings:
Snap Spacing  This sets the spacing between snap points to control the snap precision when 
you’re sketching in the active part or drawing. This is relevant only when using the Snap To 
Grid option on the Sketch tab of the Application Options dialog box. The settings for the x- 
and y-axes can be different.
Grid Display  This sets the spacing of lines in the grid display for the active fi le.
Line Weight Display Options  These set the options for line weight display in the sketch 
environment. This setting does not affect line weights in printed model sketches, just the on-
screen display.
Auto-Bend Radius  This sets the default radius for 3D sketch line corners when the auto-
bend feature is used.
You may want to confi gure the document settings in a template fi le and then save those set-
tings back to that fi le so they are always set to your specifi cation. To do so, click the Inventor 
button at the top-left corner of the screen and select Save As ➢ Save Copy As Template. This 
will open the template fi le location and allow you to save the fi le as a template. Note that 
Inventor uses the template path to designate templates rather than using the fi lename extension. 
Therefore, any IPT fi le saved under the template path is considered a template.

76 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Changing the Units of a Part File
If you start a part ﬁ le using the wrong template (inches instead of millimeters or millimeters instead 
of inches), you can change the base units of the ﬁ le by clicking the Document Settings button on the 
Tools tab of the Ribbon menu and selecting the Units tab. Changing the base units will automati-
cally convert parameters but will not override parameter inputs. For instance, if you enter a value 
of 3 inches for a dimension and then change the units of the ﬁ le to millimeters, the dimension will 
show 76.2 mm; however, when you edit the dimension, you will see the original value of 3 inches.
Sketching Basics
Now that you’ve explored the sketch options and settings, you will explore the sketching tools 
by placing sketches on an existing 3D part. This will give you an introduction to creating 2D 
sketches in 3D space. The basic workfl ow for creating any 2D sketch is as follows:
 
1. Establish the plane on which you want to sketch.
 
2. Project geometry from an existing feature to position new geometry.
 
3. Create geometry such as lines, arcs, circles, and so on.
 
4. Place sketch constraints on the geometry so the lines, arcs, and circles know how to relate 
to one another.
 
5. Dimension the geometry so it is fully defi ned and there is no part of the sketch that can 
be accidentally adjusted.
Marking Menus
Th roughout this chapter, you will be instructed to right-click and select certain options as needed. 
If you have the marking menus enabled, some of the right-click options might vary, such as in 
exact placement of the option. Th erefore, you should be prepared to interpret the instructions to 
what you see on-screen if you prefer to use the marking menus. If you prefer to have options in 
this chapter’s exercises match exactly what you see on-screen, you can disable the marking menus 
and use the classic right-click context menu. Th is can be done by selecting the Tools tab and click-
ing the Customize button. On the Marking Menu tab, you will ﬁ nd an option called Use Classic 
Context Menu.
Keep this workfl ow in mind as you go through the following steps and explore the basics of 
sketch creation. To get started, you will open an existing fi le and sketch on the faces of the part.
Creating a Sketch on an Existing Sketch
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose Open (or press Ctrl+O on the keyboard).
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3a_001.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.

SKETCHING BASICS | 77
This fi le consists of a stepped block with one beige face, one face with two holes in it, and 
one face with a triangular feature on it. To start, you will create a sketch on the top, beige 
face. Before getting started, set your application options so you will not see any unex-
pected results as you follow these steps:
 
3. From the Tools tab, click the Application Options button.
 
4. In the Application Options dialog box, click the Sketch tab.
 
5. In the Sketch tab, ensure that all the check boxes are set as shown in Figure 3.10.
Figure 3.10
Setting sketch 
options
 
6. Click Apply and then click Close to set your sketch options, and close the Application 
Options dialog box.
 
7. Hover your cursor over the ViewCube® until you see the Home button (it looks like a 
house) and then click it to make sure you are looking at the model from the predefi ned 
home view.
 
8. From the 3D Model tab, click the Start 2D Sketch button.
To create a 2D sketch, you must select a plane to sketch on, as indicated by the glyph now 
present at your cursor (it looks like a pencil and paper). You should also note the input 
prompt found either at the bottom left of your screen or at your mouse pointer, depend-
ing on the Dynamic Prompting settings you have active.
 
9. Click the top, beige face to create the new sketch on it.
Turn on Dynamic Prompting
As you use the various available tools, Inventor will prompt you with a short message concerning 
the input needed from you to complete a task. By default, the prompts are displayed at the lower 
left of the screen. To help you notice them better, you can set them to display on-screen at your 
cursor. To do so, on the Tools tab, click Application Options. Select the General tab, select the 
Show Command Prompting (Dynamic Prompts) check box, then click Apply, and ﬁ nally click Close.
Once you’ve selected the face, you’ll notice the change in the tools displayed on the Ribbon 
menu and the activation of the Sketch tab. You should also notice that the browser has grayed 
out all of the other features and only the new sketch (it should be named Sketch6) is active, as 
shown in Figure 3.11.

78 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Figure 3.11
Creating a new 
sketch
Projecting Geometry into Your Sketch
You’ll also notice that a sketch point (a small dot in the center of the beige face) has been auto-
matically created. This is the 0,0,0 origin point of the part. It has been automatically projected 
into your sketch because of the Autoproject Part Origin On Sketch Create setting, as shown in 
Figure 3.10. Next, you’ll continue with the fi le you’ve been working with and project geometry 
into your sketch.
 
1. Select the Project Geometry tool from the Sketch tab and then click somewhere in the 
middle of the beige face. You will now see the rectangular edges of the beige face 
displayed as sketch lines.
 
2. Right-click and choose OK or Cancel to exit the Project Geometry tool (or press the Esc 
key on the keyboard).
 
3. In the browser, click the plus sign next to the Sketch6 browser node. You will see a pro-
jected loop listed under the sketch, as shown in Figure 3.12.
Figure 3.12
A projected 
sketch loop
The projected loop consists of lines that trace the outer edges of the beige face. These lines 
were created by projecting the beige face into your sketch. These projected sketch lines 
are currently locked in place to always remain associative to the face from which they 

SKETCHING BASICS | 79
were created. In the next step, you will break the associative link between the projected 
edges and the face.
 
4. Right-click the projected loop in the browser and choose Break Link, as shown in 
Figure 3.13.
Figure 3.13
Break link for a 
projected loop
When you break the link, the projected loop node disappears in the browser, and the 
projected lines around the beige face change color. The color change indicates that the 
sketch lines are no longer associated with the face.
If you click and drag any of the projected lines, you’ll notice that they can be dragged 
around anywhere in the sketch plane. Because the sketch plane extends past the beige 
face, the lines can be dragged out even beyond the extents of the face. A 2D sketch 
stretches out infi nitely in the two directions that make up the plane. Next you’ll clean up 
the projected lines and project more lines.
 
5. Hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard and select all four of the lines. Notice the color 
change indicating the selection status of the lines. If you want to remove a line from the 
current set of selected objects, you can click it again while holding the Ctrl key. To add it 
back, you would click it again, still holding the Ctrl key.
 
6. With all four lines selected, right-click and choose Delete.
 
7. Select the Project Geometry tool again, and this time, select just the circular edges of the 
two holes found on the lower step of the part.
Watch the color-coded selection closely to ensure that you are getting just the hole edges 
and not the entire face the holes are on. If you choose the entire face, you will get the 
four rectangular edges as well as the two hole edges, and a projected loop will be created 
under the sketch in the browser. If you do accidentally select the face, use the Undo 
button on the Quick Access bar and then repeat step 7.
Since you selected just the circular edges, there is no projected loop created. However, the 
circles are still created so that they are associative to the holes from which they 

80 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
were created. This means that if the original holes change locations or diameter, the pro-
jected circles will adjust accordingly.
Another point to note is that when you project the edges of the holes into your sketch, 
they are projected up onto the sketch plane even though the holes are at a lower elevation. 
To see this clearly, you can use the ViewCube to adjust your viewing angle.
 
8. Click the face of the ViewCube labeled Front, and you will be able to see that the 
projected hole edges are in the same plane as the beige face on which you created your 
sketch.
 
9. Click the Home button on the ViewCube to set your view back to the home view.
Breaking Links to Projected Geometry
Next, you’ll continue working with the same fi le and will break the link with the projected 
circles and the holes from which they were created. Since no projected loop was created when 
you projected just the edges, there is no projected loop node listed under the Sketch node in the 
browser. Projected loops are created only when faces are selected. Instead, you will break the 
link by selecting the circles in the graphics area:
 
1. Right-click one of the circles and choose Break Link from the context menu. The circle 
will change color, indicating it is no longer associative to the hole and, therefore, no lon-
ger constrained in place.
 
2. Click the nonassociative circle and notice that you can resize it by clicking and dragging 
the circle itself, and you can move the circle by dragging the center point.
Deleting a Sketch
In the next steps, you will exit the current sketch and then delete the entire sketch. Deleting 
sketches from the browser is a common task, and understanding how to remove unneeded sketches 
is an important concept in learning how to manage sketches in the Model browser. Follow these 
steps, using the same fi le you’ve been using:
 
1. Click the Finish Sketch button on the Sketch tab (or right-click and choose Finish 2D 
Sketch). Notice that the Sketch node is no longer highlighted in the browser and the 
Sketch tab has disappeared, leaving the 3D Model tab active.
 
2. Right-click the Sketch6 node in the browser and choose Delete. You will notice that 
the Sketch node is removed from the browser and, therefore, the projected circles are 
removed from the graphics area.

SKETCHING BASICS | 81
Creating Another New Sketch
Next, you’ll create a new sketch on the face with the triangular cut in it. Rather than using the 
Start 2D Sketch button as you did before, you will create the sketch through the context menu.
 
1. Right-click the face with the triangular cut in it and then choose New Sketch, as shown in 
Figure 3.14.
Figure 3.14
Creating a 
sketch from the 
context menu
You will see the new Sketch node created in the browser, the Sketch tab appear in the 
Ribbon menu, and the projected origin point appear in the sketch (the dot in the center of 
the triangle).
 
2. Click the face labeled Front on the ViewCube to set your view perpendicular to the sketch 
plane.
 
3. Select the Circle tool from the Create panel of the Sketch tab.
 
4. Click to the left of the model to set the center of the circle and then drag out to draw the 
circle as shown in Figure 3.15. Then type 100 in the Heads-Up Display input box and 
press the Enter key on the keyboard to set the diameter. (If you do not see the Heads-Up 
Display input, check your settings against those shown in Figure 3.10.)

82 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Creating Dimensions
You can use sketch dimensions to specify the size and position of your sketch entities. Keep in 
mind that Inventor’s sketch dimensions are used to “drive” the sketched objects into shape and 
into position. Using dimensions in this way allows you to specify the intent of your design and 
manage it with dimensional parameters. Continue following these steps using the same fi le 
you’ve been working with:
 
1. Select the Dimension tool from the Sketch tab and then click the projected bottom point 
of the triangle and the center point of the circle. Drag your cursor down until you see the 
dimension.
 
2. Click the screen to set the dimension and then enter 150 into the input box; click the 
green check mark to apply the input.
You will see that the circle is “driven” into place and repositioned to be 150 mm from the 
point of the triangle. This is what is meant by a driving dimension. The circle’s position is 
driven by the dimension.
 
3. With the Dimension tool still active, select the center point of the circle and then the hori-
zontal line of the triangle and drag your cursor to the left until you see the dimension.
 
4. Click the screen to set the dimension and then enter 150 into the input box; click the 
green check mark to apply the input.
 
5. Right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Dimension tool.
At this point your sketch should be fully constrained, as noted in the lower right of the 
screen, and it should resemble Figure 3.16.

sioned in the

6. Use the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch.
 
7. Click the Home button on the ViewCube to set your view back to the home view.
Edit Dimensions When Created
Th ere is an option that controls the behavior related to the creation of new dimensions and the 
automatic display of the dimension edit box. If you go to the Tools tab on the Ribbon menu, click 
the Application Options button, and then select the Sketch tab, you will see a Settings button in 
the Constraint Settings area. When you click this button, you will ﬁ nd an Edit Dimension When 
Created check box in the Dimension area of the General tab. Typically this check box is selected.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 83
This concludes the steps in this introductory exercise. You should now be familiar with the 
basics of creating sketches on existing part faces and projecting existing geometry, as well as 
deleting geometry and sketches. You can close the fi le without saving changes or experiment 
with this part and create more sketches just for fun.
As you create 2D sketches in Inventor, you will often do so by selecting a face on the existing 
model, as you did in this exercise. If no plane exists, you can create what is called a work plane 
and sketch on it (work planes will be covered in the next chapter). In the next section, you will 
create a new part from a template fi le and create a base sketch.
Creating a Sketch in a New Part
When you create a new part fi le from a template, Inventor can create the fi rst sketch for you 
on one of the origin planes. You can also confi gure Inventor not to create the initial sketch 
and allow you to create it yourself. This option is set by going to the Tools tab and clicking the 
Applications Options button and then clicking the Part tab. In the following exercises, you will 
create a new part fi le and further explore the tools used to create sketch entities. To create a part 
model in Inventor, you will typically start with a 2D sketch and build a base feature from that 
sketch.
Creating a New Part File from a Template
You create new part fi les from an IPT template. Once you open the IPT template, you 
will automatically be in the sketch environment. In this exercise, you will use the 
Standard(mm).ipt fi le.
To explore sketch fundamentals in the next exercise, you should disable the HUD tools found 
on the Sketch tab of the Application Options dialog box. The HUD tools allow you to place 
dimensions as you create sketch geometry rather than having to go back and place dimensions 
later. Although the HUD tools are helpful and you will most likely want to turn them back on 
later, for the purpose of understanding sketch constraints and degrees of freedom, it is best to 
leave the dimensioning as a fi nal step.
To disable the HUD tools, click Application Options on the Tools tab. Select the Sketch tab 
and uncheck the box labeled Enable Heads-Up Display (HUD). You can turn this helpful feature 
back on later, but understand that the following steps assume it is disabled and your results may 
not match the exercise otherwise.
To create a new fi le from a template, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Tools tab, click the Application Options button.
 
2. Select the Part tab and set the Sketch On New Part Creation option to Sketch On X-Y 
Plane; then click the OK button to close the Application Options dialog box.
 
3. From the Get Started tab, click the New button. This will bring up the list of templates in 
the New File dialog box.
 
4. In the New File dialog box, select Metric from the list on the left and then select the 
Standard(mm).ipt button (see Figure 3.17).
 
5. Click Create to create a new part fi le based on this template.

84 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES

Metric tab
Creating Lines Using the Line Tool
Your screen should now show the Sketch tab set active on the ribbon, and a sketch called 
Sketch1 has been created and set current in the Model browser. In the following steps, you will 
create simple geometry using the Line tool. These steps will focus on the creation of 2D sketch 
constraints as well:
 
1. Pause your mouse pointer over the Line tool in the Sketch tab’s Create panel. (See 
Figure 3.18 for the location of the Line tool.)
Figure 3.18
Locating the 
Line tool on the 
Sketch tab

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 85
 
2. Note the tool tip that appears, providing the tool name, keyboard shortcut (in this case L), 
and a brief description of the tool. If you hover the pointer over the tool long enough, a 
second stage of the tool tip appears with a more detailed description.
 
3. Click the Line button to start the Line tool.
 
4. Hover your mouse pointer over the dot in the center of the drawing area. This is the 0,0,0 
origin point that has been automatically projected into Sketch1.
Note that when your mouse pointer moves over the dot, the dot changes to green and 
shows a small glyph symbol. This green dot is a snap symbol indicating that a point, end-
point, or midpoint has been located. The glyph symbol indicates that a sketch constraint 
is being placed. In this case, it is a Coincident constraint, which ensures that the endpoint 
of the line will stay coincident to the projected origin point. See Figure 3.19 for reference.
Figure 3.19
Endpoint snap 
symbol and coin-
cident glyph
 
5. Start your line on this point by clicking the dot and releasing the mouse button.
 
6. Move your mouse pointer directly to the right, and you will see another glyph indicating 
that a Horizontal sketch constraint is being placed. The Horizontal constraint ensures 
that the line will stay positioned horizontally. Note that if you move your mouse pointer 
so that the line is being drawn at an angle, the glyph disappears.
Turning On the Projected Origin Point
If you do not see a sketch center point in your ﬁ le, close the ﬁ le and follow these steps to turn this 
option on:
 1. From the Get Started tab, select the Application Options tab.
 2. Choose the Sketch tab.
 3. Select the Autoproject Part Origin On Sketch Create check box.
 4. Click OK.
 5. Start a new ﬁ le using the Standard(mm).ipt template.
 
7. Notice the status bar at the bottom of the screen indicating the length and angle of the 
line as you move the mouse pointer. Click the graphics window while the horizontal 
glyph is displayed to create a line roughly 45 mm long (the length is shown at the bottom 
right of the screen).

86 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Don’t worry about getting an exact length. You will set the precise length later; for now, 
you are just “roughing in” a general shape. Note that the line continues when the fi rst line 
segment is placed, and you can add more segments as required.
Temporarily Displayed Constraint Glyphs 
If you see a gray temporarily displayed horizontal constraint glyph above the line at this point, this 
is because of the setting found by going to the Tools tab, clicking the Applications button, click-
ing the Sketch tab, and then clicking the Settings button in the Constraint Settings area. On the 
General tab you’ll see the Display Constraints On Creation option, which controls this.
 
8. Move your mouse pointer straight up to add another line segment, and note that another 
glyph appears at the mouse pointer. This is a perpendicular glyph indicating that a 
sketch constraint is being placed that will hold the fi rst and second line segments perpen-
dicular (see Figure 3.20 for reference).
Figure 3.20
Creating a ver-
tical line with 
an automatic 
Perpendicular 
constraint
 
9. Click the graphics window to create the second segment at roughly 45 mm long and per-
pendicular to the fi rst segment.
 
10. Right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Line tool. Note that the Esc key will also exit the 
active tool, as indicated in the context menu.
You should now have a single horizontal line and a single vertical line making a backward 
L shape. If you made a mistake, simply use the Undo button at the top of the screen (or press 
Ctrl+Z) to undo and try again. Leave this fi le open for use in the next set of steps.
Understanding Sketch Constraints
The glyphs you were observing while creating the line segments were indicators that Inventor 
was placing sketch constraints automatically as you were sketching the lines. By default, the 
sketch constraints have their visibility turned off. To see the sketch constraints that are present 
and how they work, continue with the following steps:
 
1. Right-click anywhere in the graphics window other than on the lines and choose Show 
All Constraints (or press F8 on the keyboard). You will now see the Sketch Constraint 
icons for the constraints that were inferred as you created the line segments.
 
2. Hover your mouse pointer over the Perpendicular constraint at the corner of the two line 
segments to see both lines highlighted, which indicates that these are the objects involved 
in this particular constraint defi nition.
 
3. Hover your mouse pointer over the yellow dot at the corner of the two line segments, 
and you will see two Coincident constraints appear, as shown in Figure 3.21. Hovering 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 87
your mouse pointer over each will highlight the line to which it belongs. Coincident 
constraints are initially “rolled up” in this way because they are generally numerous and 
tend to clutter the sketch when all constraints are shown.
Figure 3.21
Showing 
constraints
When in Doubt, Right-Click
Inventor is very right-click-driven, meaning that often you can ﬁ nd the option you are looking for 
by right-clicking the object you are dealing with.
In Inventor, the right-click context menus are speciﬁ c to the objects you have selected. If no objects 
are selected, right-clicking gives you the default context menu.
Unlike in some other applications, the Esc key does not clear selected on-screen entities in the 
graphics area. Instead, you can click any blank area in the graphics area to make sure you have 
nothing selected before right-clicking. Th is way you can be certain the context menu you get is not 
speciﬁ c to an accidentally selected object.
 
4. Click the X on any of the constraints to hide just that particular constraint.
 
5. Next, right-click anywhere in the graphics area other than on the lines and choose Hide 
All Constraints (or press F9 on the keyboard). You can toggle the visibility of all sketch 
constraints on and off as needed to determine how sketch entities are constrained 
together.
 
6. Select the corner point of the two line segments and hold down and drag around in a 
circle. You will notice that the horizontal line will stretch as required but will always 
remain horizontal; the vertical line will always remain perpendicular.
 
7. Select the uppermost endpoint of the vertical line and drag around in a circular motion. 
Note that the two lines will adjust lengths as permitted but will always honor the sketch 
constraints they have placed on them.
 
8. Let up on the end of the line, and press F8 to show the constraints again.
 
9. Right-click the Horizontal constraint.
 
10. Choose Delete to remove this constraint.
 
11. Press F9 to hide the constraints again.
 
12. Click the corner of the lines and hold down and drag around in a circular motion. Note 
that the lines will stretch and adjust orientation but will maintain their perpendicular 
and coincident relationships.

88 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
At this point, the constraints present in your sketch were all inferred (placed automatically). 
Letting Inventor infer sketch constraints is the quickest and often most desirable way to place 
them; however, sometimes you’ll need to constrain sketch elements manually. To do so, you can 
use the constraint tools found in the Constrain panel of the ribbon.
To place the Horizontal constraint back on the line from which you removed it, follow these 
steps:
 
1. On the Constrain panel of the ribbon, click the Horizontal Constraints icon (Figure 3.22).
Figure 3.22
Placing a 
Horizontal con-
straint manually
 
2. Click the fi rst line segment you sketched to set it back to horizontal. Be careful to select 
the line itself and not the midpoint of the line (the midpoint shows as a green dot when 
selected).
Use the Line tool to add three more line segments to the sketch to complete the shape, as 
shown in Figure 3.23. Pay attention to the cursor glyphs as you sketch, and do not be concerned 
with the precise lengths of the lines or the angle of the diagonal line. You can keep this fi le open 
for use in the next set of steps or close it and use the fi le provided.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 89
Constraint Inference and Persistence
You can suppress the automatic placement of sketch constraints (constraint inference) by holding 
down Ctrl on the keyboard as you sketch. You can also disable constraint inference and persistence 
using the Constraint Inference and Constraint Persistence buttons in the Sketch tab’s Constrain 
panel.
If constraint persistence is disabled, you will still see the Constraint Glyph icon when sketching, 
and you will be able to place sketch entities in accordance with the displayed glyph; however, no 
actual constraint will be placed on the sketched object. For instance, sketching a line that is ori-
ented perpendicular to an existing line without actually having a Perpendicular constraint placed 
automatically is possible by toggling oﬀ  the constraint persistence. Coincident constraints at the 
endpoints of the lines will still be placed.
Constraint persistence is automatically disabled if constraint inference is turned oﬀ , but inference 
can be on with persistence turned oﬀ . You can also control which constraints are inferred by right-
clicking in a sketch and choosing Constraint Options.
Using Degrees of Freedom to View Underconstrained Sketch Elements
Typically, your goal is to create fully constrained sketches so that no aspect of the sketch can be 
changed without deliberate action. To examine your sketch for underconstrained elements, you 
can use the Degrees of Freedom (DOF) tool. To explore DOF, you can use the fi le you have been 
working with in the previous steps or open the fi le mi_3a_002.ipt from the Chapter 03 direc-
tory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. Make sure Sketch1 is active for edits by right-
clicking it and choosing Edit Sketch. Then follow these steps:
 
1. To view the DOF arrows for your sketch entities, right-click anywhere in the graphics 
area that is not on a sketch object and choose Show All Degrees Of Freedom. Your sketch 
should resemble Figure 3.24.
Figure 3.24
Showing the 
degrees of free-
dom in a sketch
 
2. Notice the arrow indicators showing the DOF for each sketched line.
 
3. Drag a line endpoint, and you will see that the sketch lines will drag only in a direction 
or orientation that follows the DOF arrows. If your sketch becomes distorted in an unde-
sirable way, use the Undo button at the top of the screen or press Ctrl+Z to set it back as 
it was.

Dragging to Refine Your Sketch
Experienced Inventor users rely on the click-and-drag technique to ﬁ ne-tune the general shape of 
a sketch rather than trying to get things precisely right from the beginning. Become familiar with 
this technique so you can use it to your advantage.
 
4. To toggle the DOF visibility back off, right-click again and choose Hide All Degrees Of 
Freedom.
 
5. Note that you can right-click an individual sketch object or a selection set of sketch 
objects and choose Display Degrees Of Freedom to show the DOF for just those selected 
objects.
 
6. Right-click and choose Show All Degrees Of Freedom again to have these displayed for 
reference in the next steps.
Using Dimensions to Fully Constrain a Sketch
To work toward your goal of a fully constrained sketch, you will now add dimensions to lock 
down lengths, angles, and so on. Adding dimensions will remove degrees of freedom from 
your sketch objects and help you defi ne the intent of your design. You will use the General 
Dimension tool to place dimensions on your sketch. Note that although the tool is called 
General Dimension, the button simply reads Dimension. 
You can continue with the fi le you are working or open the fi le mi_3a_002.ipt from the 
Chapter 03 directory of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. If you’re opening the prepared 
fi le, ensure that Sketch1 is active for edits by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Sketch; then 
right-click and choose Show All Degrees Of Freedom. Then follow these steps:
 
1. On the Sketch tab of the ribbon, click the Dimension button in the Constrain panel.
 
2. In the graphics area, click the bottom horizontal line and drag down to display the 
dimension.
 
3. Click below the line to place the dimension; you should see an Edit Dimension box, as 
shown in Figure 3.25. If you do not see the Edit Dimension box, you can right-click any-
where in the blank space of the graphics area and click Edit Dimension to ensure that this 
box shows up after each dimension is placed. Then simply click the dimension to open 
this input box.
Figure 3.25

sion on the sketch

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 91
 
4. In the Edit Dimension dialog box, type Length = 45. Because you are working in a 
millimeter-based part fi le, the units are assumed to be 45 mm, and Inventor will add the 
mm automatically.
Notice that the Edit Dimension box caption reads something such as d0. This indicates 
that this dimension parameter is named d0. Initially, Inventor names the fi rst dimen-
sion used in the fi le d0, the next is named d1, and so on. By entering Length = 45, you 
are renaming the dimension from d0 to Length and changing this length value from the 
sketched value to a precise value of 45 mm. You are not required to rename your dimen-
sions, but it is good practice to name any that you intend to reference later.
 
5. Click the green check mark in the Edit Dimension box, or press the Enter key to set the 
dimension value. Take note that the dimension “drives” the sketch line to be 45 mm long. 
Also notice that some of the DOF arrows have been removed.
 
6. Click the 45 mm dimension to edit it. Notice that the Edit Dimension box caption now 
reads Length and the value now reads 45 mm.
 
7. Change the value to 50 mm and click the green check mark.
 
8. Click the bottom horizontal line again and drag up, but do not click to place the dimen-
sion. You will see the same horizontal dimension displayed.
 
9. Click the top horizontal line and drag down; you will see the dimension change from the 
horizontal dimension evaluating the length of the bottom line to a vertical dimension 
evaluating the distance between the top and bottom lines.
 
10. Click in the graphics area to place the dimension.
 
11. Enter Width =.
 
12. Click the 50 mm dimension you placed in the previous steps. Notice that clicking one 
dimension while editing another will create a reference between the two.
 
13. Complete the formula to read Width = Length/2, as shown in Figure 3.26.
Figure 3.26
Referencing one 
parameter to 
another
 
14. Click the green check mark or press the Enter key to set the dimension value. Observe 
that the Width dimension is evaluated at half the Length dimension and that it displays 
an fx: before the value to denote that there is a function used to evaluate this dimension. 
Also notice that more DOF arrows have been removed as you have further defi ned the 
sketch.

92 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
 
15. If your sketch has become a bit skewed, exit the Dimension tool by right-clicking and 
choosing Cancel (or by pressing the Esc key).
 
16. Click the top endpoint of the vertical line to the right and drag it so that the general shape 
of the profi le is restored.
 
17. On the Sketch tab of the ribbon, click the Dimension icon in the Constrain panel, or just 
press D on the keyboard to start the Dimension tool again.
 
18. Click the vertical line to the right and then click the diagonal line. Take care to click the 
lines and not the endpoints of the lines because clicking the endpoints will result in a dif-
ferent dimension type.
 
19. Click in the graphics area to place the dimension. You will be presented with an edit box 
for an angle dimension. Enter Angle1 = 108 and click the green check mark.
 
20. Last, on the Sketch tab of the ribbon, click the Equal button in the Constrain panel to 
place an Equal constraint. Select the top horizontal line and the vertical line on the right 
to set those two lines equal, as shown in Figure 3.27.
Figure 3.27
Applying an equal 
constraint
Your sketch is now fully constrained and should resemble Figure 3.28.
Figure 3.28
A fully con-
strained sketch
A fully constrained sketch is evident by taking note of the following:
 
◆
All the DOF arrows are now gone.
 
◆
You will see Fully Constrained in the status bar at the bottom right of the screen.
 
◆
Your sketch lines will have turned a different color than they were originally, before the 
sketch became constrained.
 
◆
A “thumb tack” appears (upper left) on the Browser Sketch icon once the sketch is fully 
constrained.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 93
Understanding the Save Options
At this point, you may have seen a save reminder balloon in the top-right corner of the screen. 
It is always good practice to save often when working in any application. To save a part fi le, you 
must fi rst exit the sketch and then save:
 
1. On the ribbon’s Sketch tab, click Finish Sketch in the Exit panel. Or right-click in the 
graphics area and choose Finish 2D Sketch from the menu.
 
2. Click the Inventor button and then select Save.
 
3. Select your Chapter 03 folder and name the fi le mi_001.
You should be aware of all the save options you have and how they differ. They can all be 
accessed by clicking the Inventor button and choosing Save or Save As from the Application 
menu. Here’s a list:
Save  Choosing this option saves the active document contents to the fi le specifi ed in the 
window title, and the fi le remains open.
Save All  Choosing this option saves all open document contents to the fi le specifi ed in the 
window title, and the fi les remain open.
Save As  Choosing this option saves the active document contents to the fi le specifi ed in the 
Save As dialog box. The original document is closed, and the newly saved fi le is opened. The 
contents of the original fi le are unchanged.
Save Copy As  Choosing this option saves a copy of the active fi le as specifi ed in the Save 
Copy As dialog box, and the original fi le remains open.
Save Copy As Template  Choosing this option saves a copy of the active fi le as a template to 
the template folder, and the original fi le remains open.
Adjusting the Save Options
Inventor does not have an automatic save function but instead has a save reminder utility that 
allows you to save by just clicking within the bubble to launch a standard save operation. To adjust 
the save timer settings, select the Application Options button and then select the Save tab.
Making a Sketch Active for Edits
To save a fi le, you are required to exit the sketch. To continue making edits to the sketch once it’s 
saved, you need to set the sketch active for edits. Here’s how to activate the sketch:
 
1. Locate Sketch1 in the Model browser to the left of your screen and either right-click and 
choose Edit Sketch or double-click the Browser Sketch icon.
 
2. Notice that the Sketch node listed in the browser consists of the Sketch icon and the 
sketch name. Clicking the sketch name once and then again (don’t double-click) allows 
you to rename the sketch. Therefore, you may want to develop a habit of double-clicking 
the Sketch icon rather than the sketch name to make a sketch active for edits.
Look at the browser and notice that the rest of the browser nodes are grayed out and Sketch1 
is highlighted, letting you know that the sketch is active for editing. You’ll also notice that the 
sketch tools are available.

94 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Using Construction Geometry
Now that the sketch is active, you will add more geometry and dimensions to further explore 
the sketch tools. You’ll start by sketching a line and then converting that line to a construction 
line. Construction geometry is often used to help locate and constrain normal sketch geometry.
The primary difference between construction geometry and standard geometry is that 
construction geometry is fi ltered out of profi le calculations. In other words, if you have a part 
profi le consisting of a rectangle and you run a construction line down the middle of it, resulting 
in two halves of the original profi le, Inventor will ignore the construction line and see only one 
profi le when you create a solid part from the sketch. To create a construction line in your sketch, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Line tool in the Sketch tab’s Create panel. (Recall that you can access the Line 
tool by pressing the L key on the keyboard as well.)
 
2. Start the line at the bottom-left corner of the profi le, keeping an eye on your mouse 
pointer to ensure that you see the green dot (indicating the endpoint) and the constraint 
glyph (indicating that a Coincident constraint is being inferred).
 
3. Set the second point of the line on the midpoint of the diagonal line. Again, you should 
see a green dot and a coincident glyph, as shown in Figure 3.29.
Figure 3.29
Placing a con-
struction line 
showing steps 2 
and 3

4. Right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Line tool. 
 
5. Select the new diagonal line you just created.
 
6. On the Sketch tab (to the far right), click the Construction icon in the Format panel to set 
the diagonal line as a construction line, as shown in Figure 3.30.
Figure 3.30
Converting to a 
construction line
Notice that the line has changed from a solid line to a dashed line, indicating that it is now 
a construction line. If you were to turn this sketch into a 3D solid at this point, Inventor would 

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 95
not recognize the construction line as a boundary and would therefore see only one profi le from 
which to create the solid. However, if you had not made the diagonal line a construction line, 
Inventor would see two profi les, one on each side of this diagonal line.
Using the Polygon Tool and Creating an Aligned Dimension
Next, you will need to add a polygon to the midpoint of the construction line and manually 
place a constraint to position it in place. You will then need to place a dimension to size it:
 
1. In the Sketch tab’s Create panel, click the Polygon tool (found under the Rectangle fl yout 
menu).
 
2. Select the midpoint of the diagonal construction line, keeping an eye on your mouse 
pointer for the green midpoint dot and the coincident glyph.
 
3. Leave the polygon settings at the defaults and drag out the size and orientation to 
roughly match Figure 3.31.
Figure 3.31
Creating a 
polygon
 
4. In the Sketch tab’s Constrain panel, click the Parallel Constraint icon.
 
5. Choose any of the fl ats on the polygon and the diagonal profi le line, as shown in 
Figure 3.32, to make the two lines parallel.
Figure 3.32
Setting the 
two edges to be 
parallel

96 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
 
6. In the Sketch tab’s Constrain panel, click the Dimension tool.
 
7. On the polygon, click two opposing points to create a dimension between the two points.
 
8. Pull your mouse pointer to the side to preview the dimension. Notice that the orientation 
wants to be horizontal or vertical depending on the location of your mouse pointer.
 
9. Right-click and choose Aligned to force the aligned solution for this particular dimen-
sion, as shown in Figure 3.33.
Figure 3.33
Creating a point-
to-point aligned 
dimension
 
10. Click the graphics window to place the dimension.
 
11. Enter Hex_Size = 0.375 in.
 
12. Click the green check mark or press the Enter key to set the dimension value. Notice that 
although you entered an Imperial unit of inches, Inventor converted the value automati-
cally to the fi le default of millimeters. This is a powerful function that allows you to use 
dimension inputs to do conversion calculations on the fl y.
Using an Underscore in Parameter Names
When specifying parameter names, keep in mind that spaces are not allowed but you can use 
underscores.
Creating Mixed-Unit Formulas
You can mix any acceptable units in the same parameter formula and allow Inventor to do the 
conversion. For instance, entering the following into a dimension is perfectly acceptable:
3.25 ft – 1 m + 3 cm + 0.125 in
Th is would return a value of 23.775 mm in a millimeter part.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 97
Using Oﬀ set and Creating a Th ree-Point Rectangle
You will now use the Offset and Three Point Rectangle tools to create more sketch 
geometry:
 
1. In the Sketch tab’s Modify panel, click the Offset tool.
 
2. Before selecting any geometry, right-click anywhere that is not on the sketch geometry.
 
3. Ensure that the Loop Select and Constrain Offset options are both selected.
 
◆
Selecting Loop Select means that all joined geometry will be selected as a loop. With 
this option toggled off, individual line or curve segments are selected.
 
◆
Selecting Constrain Offset means the new geometry is constrained to be equidistant 
to the original. If you turn this option off, the new geometry is created unconstrained to 
the original.
 
4. Click the polygon and drag to the outside.
 
5. Click in the graphics window to set the offset distance.
 
6. Right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Offset tool.
 
7. In the Sketch tab’s Constrain panel, click the Dimension tool (or press D on the 
keyboard).
 
8. To dimension the offset, select an edge of the original polygon and then select the corre-
sponding edge on the new offset polygon.
 
9. Drag the dimension out from the center of the polygon and place it anywhere.
 
10. Enter Hex_Offset = 1/16 in and click the green check mark. The result should appear 
similar to Figure 3.34.
Figure 3.34
Th e oﬀ set polygon
 
11. In the Sketch tab’s Create panel, click the Rectangle fl yout and choose Rectangle Three 
Point (Figure 3.35).

98 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES

Rectangle Th ree 
Point tool
 
12. Create the rectangle using the three points shown in Figure 3.36. Click the top-left point 
fi rst, then the top-right point, and then the bottom-middle point. Make certain you are 
seeing the green snap dots and Coincident constraint glyphs at each point.
Figure 3.36
Placing a three-
point rectangle
 
13. Right-click and choose Cancel. If your rectangle is not fully constrained, click the corner 
and drag it away from the line and then back to the line, setting it on the line when you 
see the constraint glyph.
This completes the creation of most of your sketch objects in this exercise. Save your fi le and 
use it in the next set of steps. Your sketch should resemble Figure 3.37.
Figure 3.37
Your completed 
sketch
To Trim or Not to Trim
You can ﬁ nd the Trim tool in the Sketch tab’s Modify panel. Although you might be tempted to use 
the Trim tool to tidy up the sketch, keep in mind that in Inventor you are creating solid models 
from these sketches, and therefore trimming “extra” lines from a sketch is not required.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 99
More important, though, trimming these extra lines in a sketch often does more harm than good. 
Th is is because all the lines in the sketch have constraint relationships between them. When you 
use the Trim tool, you are inadvertently removing constraints that were holding your sketch objects 
together. As a rule, use the Trim tool only when necessary.
You might ﬁ nd the Split tool is actually what you want. Split will divide a line into separate segments 
without removing them. And it will also maintain sketch constraints. You can ﬁ nd the Split tool 
in the Sketch tab’s Modify panel as well. Hover your mouse pointer over it for a moment, and you 
will get a dynamic tool tip showing you how it works.
Creating Driven Dimensions
Now you’ll take a look at creating driven dimensions and editing the parameters you just cre-
ated through the Parameters dialog box. Because dimensions defi ne the parameters of your 
design, you can use them to control the design intent. At other times you may want to place a 
dimension that does not drive the design but instead is driven by other parameters. In those 
cases, such dimensions are called driven dimensions.
Unlike Inventor’s standard parametric dimensions, driven dimensions do not change the 
geometry but instead change when the geometry changes. Driven dimensions are created either 
by placing a dimension on already defi ned geometry or by explicitly making them driven.
You can use your current fi le or open the fi le mi_3a_003.ipt from the Chapter 03 direc-
tory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. If you’re opening the prepared fi le, ensure that 
Sketch1 is active for edits by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Sketch. Follow these steps to 
explore driven dimensions:
 
1. Double-click the 50 mm Length dimension.
 
2. Replace the value of 50 with 60 and press the Enter key.
 
3. Take note that the vertical dimension retains the intent of your design and remains at 
half the Length value.
 
4. In the Sketch tab’s Constrain panel, click the Dimension tool (or press D on the 
keyboard).
 
5. Select the vertical line on the right of the sketch and click the graphics window to place 
the dimension.
 
6. Depending on the options you have selected in the Sketch tab of the Application Options 
dialog box, you might be presented with a dialog box warning you that this dimension 
will overconstrain the sketch. If so, click Accept. In either case you’ll place the dimension 
as a driven dimension by clicking the screen.
Notice that the dimension is created in parentheses, denoting it is driven by other param-
eters and, therefore, is considered a reference parameter. Driven dimensions are useful in 
capturing dimensions for use in the calculations of other features.
 
7. Switch from the Sketch tab to the Manage tab on the ribbon.
 
8. Click the Parameters tool. This will open the Parameters dialog box listing all the dimen-
sions you’ve created in this part as parameters, as shown in Figure 3.38.

100 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Figure 3.38
Parameters 
dialog box
 
9. Enter Vertical_Leg for the reference parameter name. Be sure to use an underscore rather 
than a space.
 
10. Still in the Parameters dialog box, change the Length value from 60 mm to 65 mm.
If you have the Immediate Update check box selected, the dimension is automatically 
updated in the sketch. If not, you will need to update the dimension manually by click-
ing the Update button on the Quick Access bar at the top left of the screen, as shown in 
Figure 3.39.
Figure 3.39

on the Quick 
Access bar
 
11. Ensure that the Immediate Update check box is selected; then click Done to return to the 
sketch.
 
12. Right-click in the graphics area and choose Dimension Display ➢ Expression from the 
context menu. Observe the dimension names and expression values, as shown in 
Figure 3.40.
Figure 3.40
Displaying dimen-
sion expressions
 
13. Right-click in the graphics area and choose Dimension Display ➢ Value from the context 
menu to set the dimension display back to display the calculated value.
You can leave this fi le open and use it in the next set of steps.

CREATING A SKETCH IN A NEW PART | 101
Dimension Arrangement
Although the arrangement of sketch dimensions is not all that important because these dimensions 
will ultimately be consumed by a solid model, it is still helpful to be able to read them in the sketch. 
You can rearrange jumbled sketch dimensions by clicking the text/numbers and dragging them as 
you like. Note too that this must be done once you’ve exited the Dimension tool because clicking a 
dimension with the Dimension tool active edits that dimension. You’ll notice that because of the 
intelligence you’ve built into the sketch, when you modify and update the Length dimension (param-
eter) value, the dependent values change as well.
Next, you’ll change a driving dimension to a driven dimension and a driven to a driving. By 
doing this, you can modify the intent of your design and change which parameter is a key input. 
You can use your current fi le or open the fi le mi_3a_004.ipt from the Chapter 03 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. If you’re opening the prepared fi le, ensure that Sketch1 
is active for edits by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Sketch. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the 65 mm Length dimension.
 
2. In the Sketch tab’s Format panel, click the Driven Dimension tool. Notice that the 
Length dimension is now set in parentheses, indicating that it is now driven rather than 
driving.
 
3. Double-click any blank area in the graphics window to deselect the previous dimension.
 
4. Select the vertical dimension that is in parentheses.
 
5. Click the Driven Dimension tool again to toggle this dimension from a driven to a 
driving dimension.
 
6. Double-click the vertical dimension to edit its value.
 
7. Enter 40 mm and click the green check mark. Notice that the Vertical_Leg parameter now 
drives the Length parameter, which still drives the Width dimension.
You are beginning to see the power of parametric design. Next, you’ll add a user param-
eter and use it to drive the design. A user parameter is a design input that is not based on 
the geometry in the sketch. This allows you to enter user variables to drive your design.
 
8. From the Manage tab on the ribbon, select the Parameters tool. This will open the 
Parameters dialog box.
 
9. Click the Add Numeric button found at the bottom of the dialog box to create a new user 
parameter.
 
10. Enter Wrench_Size for the user parameter name.
 
11. Click the mm in the Unit/Type column and select the inch input from the Length 
category.
 
12. Enter 0.4 for the Equation column input.

102 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
 
13. Edit the equation input for the Hex_Size parameter and replace 0.375 in with 
Wrench_Size.
You have now set the Hex_Size parameter to be driven by your user parameter named 
Wrench_Size. Your inputs should look like Figure 3.41.
Figure 3.41
Creating a user 
parameter
 
14. Click the Done button to close the Parameter dialog box and then use the Update button 
to update the sketch if needed.
Now that you’ve been introduced to the basics of creating a parametric sketch, you’ll take 
a more in-depth look at these tools in the next sections. You can close this fi le without saving 
changes.
Taking a Closer Look at Sketch Constraints
In the following sections, you’ll take a closer look at each of the available sketch constraints. As 
you proceed, it may occur to you that you could use other sketch constraints in place of the one 
suggested in the exercise steps. Be aware that as you create sketch constraints, there are often 
multiple solutions to get the same result.
In the following exercises, you will be opening a series of part fi les, setting the sketch as 
active for edits, and applying different sketch constraints. Each of these fi les demonstrates the 
function of a different type of sketch constraint. All of these fi les contain a sketch called <—
Double Click to Edit (Sketch 1). You will edit the sketch in each fi le and apply the appropriate 
sketch from the Constrain panel of the Sketch tab, shown in Figure 3.42.

Horizontal and Vertical Orientation 
Because the terms Horizontal and Vertical are dependent on your current view orientation, placing 
Horizontal and Vertical constraints can sometimes be confusing. To help with this, Inventor will 
display a light dotted line when placing a Horizontal or Vertical constraint. Th is line shows the 
orientation that Inventor is considering correct at the time of placement. 
Keep in mind that no matter how you change your view orientation Inventor maintains the deﬁ ni-
tion of horizontal and vertical based on the coordinate system of the ﬁ le.

progressive tool tips are a great help when you’re attempting to use tools that you don’t often 
use and you need a helpful hint to remember what they do and how they do it.
Creating Arcs
You can create sketch arcs by using one of three arc tools available in Inventor’s sketch environ-
ment. All three arc types are available in a drop-down menu in the Sketch tab’s Create panel. 
Once placed, the three arcs behave the same; it is simply the manner in which they are created 
that differentiates them.
A three-point arc is an arc defi ned by two endpoints and a point on the arc. The fi rst click 
sets the fi rst endpoint, the second sets the other endpoint, and the third point sets the direction 
and radius of the arc, as shown in Figure 3.55.
Figure 3.55

A center-point arc is an arc defi ned by a center point and two endpoints. The fi rst click sets 
the center point, the second sets the radius and start point, and the third sets the endpoint and/
or arc length, as shown in Figure 3.56.

A tangent arc is an arc from the endpoint of an existing curve. The fi rst click must be on the 
endpoint of an existing curve and sets a Tangent constraint on the endpoint. The second point 
sets the end of the tangent arc, as shown in Figure 3.57.

To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3h_013.ipt located in the Chapter 03 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open. The goal here is to re-create the 
oblong shape already present in the sketch.
 
3. In the Model browser, double-click Sketch1 to edit it. Or right-click and choose Edit 
Sketch.
 
4. In the Sketch tab’s Create panel, click the Line icon.
 
5. Click the projected origin point as the start point of the line and then release the mouse 
button. This is the small dot located below the oblong shape and at 0,0 of the sketch.
 
6. Pull your mouse pointer to the right, making sure you see a horizontal or parallel glyph, 
indicating that your line is horizontal.
 
7. Click the screen to set the second point of the line and then release the mouse button.
 
8. Now to sketch an arc without exiting the Line tool, click and hold the endpoint you just 
created and then (still holding down on the mouse button) drag your mouse pointer out 
to preview the arc. If the arc previews in the wrong direction, simply return your mouse 
pointer to the endpoint and try again. It may be helpful to “trace” the guideline cross and 
exaggerate the arc size to get the direction established and then bring your mouse pointer 
back in to get the size you want.
 
9. Release the mouse button to end the arc and continue the Line tool.
 
10. Continue creating line/arc segments, or right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Line 
tool. Practice this a few times, and you’ll have it mastered in a short time.
Creating Automatic Tangents with the Line Tool
When adding tangent line segments to a circle or arc, you can apply the Tangent constraints 
automatically. To do so, start the Line tool and click and hold on the circle or arc on which you 
intend to create the tangent line. You will see a tangent glyph. You can drag the line segment out 
to the length and orientation desired. To change the tangent direction, simply rub your cursor 
over the tangent point again and drag the line segment the other direction. Figure 3.59 illus-
trates this technique.

Understanding the Point/Center Point Tool
You can use the Point/Center Point tool, found in the Sketch tab’s Create panel, to create center 
marks for locating hole centers and specifi c coordinate points. Center points are used by the 
Hole and Sheet Metal Punch tools in the modeling environment to automatically locate hole 
centers. Points, or sketch points as they are often called, are initially ignored by the Hole and 
Punch tools but can be manually selected for use. Another key difference between the two point 
types is that sketch points are deleted when the associated geometry is deleted. Center points 
are not.
You can change the center point to a sketch point, or vice versa, by selecting the point 
and clicking the Center Point button on the Format menu of the Sketch tab, as shown in 
Figure 3.60.

9. In the Sketch tab’s Create panel, click the drop-down for Project Geometry and choose 
Project Cut Edges.
You’ll see that the sliced edges are now projected as sketch lines into the sketch. These lines 
can be used to dimension or constrain other sketch geometry too and will remain associative 
to the sliced features. Oftentimes a work plane is used to create a sketch in the middle of a part 
such as this. Work planes are covered in Chapter 4, “Basic Modeling Techniques.” For now, you 
can fi nish the sketch and close the fi le without saving changes.

Breaking the Link with Projected Geometry
Projected geometry is created by projecting an edge or a face. When you project faces, a browser 
node for a projected loop is created under the Sketch node. When you project edges, no browser 
node is created. You might need to break the link of the projected geometry in order to modify it.

Learning More about Dimensions
In the following sections, you’ll take a look at more Dimension tools and settings to help you 
master this important part of sketch creation.
Using One General Dimension Tool to Do It All
It is important to understand that you get different results from the Dimension tool depending 
on what geometry is selected or in what order it is selected. Here are the dimension types you 
can place with the General Dimension tool:
Linear dimension from one object:
Linear dimension between two objects:
Aligned dimension between two objects: Select the objects and right-click to choose 
the Aligned solution.

Angular dimension between two edges:
Angular dimension between three points:
Dimensions to circles or arcs: Select the object and then right-click to switch between diam-
eter or radius solutions for either arcs or circles.
Dimension to the center of arcs and circles: Select the fi rst element of the dimension and then 
click anywhere on the arc or circle. Note the linear glyph indicating the linear solution you 
will get.
Dimension to the tangent of arcs and circles: Select the fi rst element of the dimension and 
then click the tangent when you see the tangent glyph appear.

Setting Up Automatic Dimensions
In addition to the General Dimension tool, Inventor has an Automatic Dimensions And 
Constraints tool. It is generally poor practice to use the Automatic Dimensions And Constraints 
tool to apply all dimensions to your sketches because it will do so in an illogical way. However, 
you can benefi t from this tool by placing the dimensions that defi ne the intent of your design 
with the General Dimension tool and then allowing the Automatic Dimensions And Constraints 
tool to place the remaining dimensions to fully constrain the sketch.
To take a look at the Automatic Dimensions And Constraints tool in action, follow these 
steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le named mi_3h_015.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. In the Model browser, locate Sketch1; double-click to edit or right-click and choose Edit 
Sketch.
 
4. In the Sketch tab’s Constrain panel, click the Automatic Dimensions And Constraints 
icon. Notice that the Auto Dimension dialog box shows the number of dimensions 
required to fully constrain the sketch.
 
5. Accept the default settings to add both dimensions and constraints.
 
6. With the Curves button enabled, select all the geometry in the sketch (you can do this 
quickly with a selection window).
Figure 3.62 shows that two dimensions will be added to fully constrain the sketch.

7. Click Apply to add dimensions to the selected geometry.
 
8. When fi nished, click Done.

Working with Sketch Centerlines
You can create centerlines in sketches either by creating a regular line and then changing 
it to a centerline or by changing the line type to centerline fi rst and then creating the line. 
Dimensioning to a centerline gives you a diametric solution by default, but you can opt for a 
linear solution by right-clicking and deselecting Linear Diameter, as shown in Figure 3.63. In 
the following exercises, you will fi nd the steps for both methods of centerline creation as well as 
how to change the solution when dimensioning to a centerline.
Figure 3.63
Dimensioning to a

To change to centerline line type before creating sketch geometry, follow these steps:
 
1. Ensure that the sketch is active for editing by double-clicking it or right-clicking and 
choosing Edit Sketch.
 
2. On the Sketch tab, click the Centerline icon in the Format panel.
 
3. Now use the Line tool to sketch lines as you would normally. Note that the Centerline 
icon stays pushed in (On) until you click it again.
To change an existing line to a centerline, follow these steps:
 
1. Ensure that the sketch is active for editing by double-clicking it or right-clicking and

Measuring Geometry
You can use the Measure tools to gather measurements from your model without the need to 
place a dimension in your sketch. These tools can be accessed from the Inspect tab, from the 
Tools tab, or by right-clicking any empty place in the graphics area of the screen and choosing 
Measure from the context menu. When using the Tools tab, you can click the drop-down on 
the Measure panel to reveal the Region Measure option. The measurement tools include the 
following:
Measure Distance  Measures the length lines and arcs, the distance between points, and the 
radius or diameter of a circle.
Measure Angle  Measures the angle between two lines or points.
Measure Loops  Measures the length of closed loops.
Measure Area  Measures the area of enclosed regions.
Get Region Properties  Measures the area and perimeter and the Area Moment Of Inertia 
properties of sketch loop regions. This tool is available only while editing 2D sketches.

Creating Sketches from AutoCAD Geometry
Converting accurate, dimensioned 2D drawings eliminates the need to redraw all of the 
original geometry. Inventor allows selective importing of 2D drawings with associative 
geometry directly into a new part sketch. If you have an existing drawing library of 2D 
AutoCAD fi les, you may fi nd it benefi cial to use those fi les to create new 3D feature-based 
parametric parts in Inventor. Success in importing existing drawings depends on the fol-
lowing criteria:
 
◆
The AutoCAD fi le must contain accurate original geometry.
 
◆
Duplicate geometry must be deleted from the AutoCAD fi le.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

120 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
 
◆
Proper AutoCAD drawing techniques must be employed in creating the AutoCAD fi le. For 
example, there must be only one line segment between any two points. Two shorter lines 
appearing as a single line will be imported exactly as drawn in the AutoCAD fi le.
 
◆
For dimensions to be converted to Inventor parametric dimensions, the existing AutoCAD 
dimensions must be associative to the geometry. Disconnected dimensions (AutoCAD 
Defpoints not snapped to the proper geometry location) will cause problems when con-
verted to Inventor dimensions.
Importing Existing AutoCAD Designs
You begin the process of converting an AutoCAD drawing to Inventor parts by creating a new 
part fi le. When in active sketch mode, you can import AutoCAD sketch geometry by selecting 
the Insert panel on the Sketch tab and clicking the Insert AutoCAD File icon. To see this process 
yourself, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, select the New button.
 
2. In the New File dialog box, click Metric in the left pane and click the Standard(mm)
.ipt icon.
 
3. Click Create to create a new part fi le based on this template.
 
4. On the Insert panel of the Sketch tab, click the Insert AutoCAD File icon.
 
5. In the resulting dialog box, select the fi le Import1.dwg from the Chapter 03 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
6. Click Open to start the conversion process. Once the AutoCAD fi le opens, you will move 
into a series of Import Destination Options pages. The fi rst page is mostly grayed out 
except for specifying units, constraining endpoints, and optionally applying geometric 
constraints upon import under most conditions. Set your selections as shown in 
Figure 3.65.

CREATING SKETCHES FROM AUTOCAD GEOMETRY | 121
Creating Sketches from a Graphic Image
Occasionally you may need to create a part from a scanned image or napkin sketch. To do this, 
you can insert the scanned image or napkin sketch right into your sketch and sketch over the top 
of it. Although this is generally not a good approach for reproducing precise machined parts, it 
is a valid workﬂ ow when designing consumer products and the general shape and feel of parts 
need to be captured. If you have a need for this type of design on a regular basis, you may want 
to investigate Autodesk® AliasStudio™ software as well. Here are the general steps for creating 
sketches from an image:
 1. Place an image into a part sketch by clicking the Insert Image icon on the Sketch tab.
 2. Browse for the image you want to place into the sketch and click Open when the image is located.
 3. Th e mouse pointer is then attached to the upper-left corner of the image. To place the image, simply 
click an insert point on-screen.
 4. Once the image is placed, the edges of the image can be dimensioned and constrained like any 
other sketch entity.
Now you can sketch on top of the image, tracing the edges to create the proﬁ le, and then use the 
Dimension tool to tweak the sketch as required.
When an AutoCAD drawing is imported into a sketch, Inventor records the unit type of the 
AutoCAD fi le. By default, the unit type is displayed within the import dialog box but grayed 
out. If the unit type is not correct or the unit is of a different type than you require, you may 
input a different input-unit type.
Selecting the Constrain End Points box allows insertion of Coincident constraints between 
sketch objects found to have endpoints that occupy the same coordinates. When the Apply 
Geometric Constraints box is checked, Inventor will add minimal constraints to the imported 
AutoCAD geometry. Note too that although some dimensions will not be imported, those that 
are will be parametric Inventor dimensions. Figure 3.66 shows the result of importing the fi le 
Import1.dwg.

122 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Figure 3.66

If the AutoCAD geometry was created at the 0,0 origin, then it should import into Inventor 
at the same location. If the AutoCAD geometry is not located at the origin of the sketch, you can 
use the Move command, selecting both the geometry and any dimensions, to move the entire 
imported sketch into the proper location. You might also prefer to redefi ne the geometry origin 
in AutoCAD and then import or reimport it into Inventor.
You should note that this imported drawing might be further broken down into separate fea-
tures. For instance, each hole could be a separate feature. Note too that having the round corners 
modeled as features separate from the base feature allows for easier edits in Inventor.
Copying and Pasting Existing AutoCAD Designs into Inventor
Although using the import wizard as described earlier works without having AutoCAD open or 
even installed, you can import AutoCAD geometry in an even more effi cient manner by simply 
copying from an open AutoCAD fi le straight into an Inventor sketch, as described in these steps:
 
1. Open the existing fi le in AutoCAD.
 
2. From an open AutoCAD fi le, simply select the geometry you want to import, right-click, 
and choose Copy, thereby copying the selected objects to the Windows clipboard.
 
3. In Inventor and with a 2D sketch active for editing, right-click and choose Paste. You will 
be presented with a bounding-box preview of the pasted entities.
 
4. At this point, you can right-click and choose Paste Options to ensure that the insert scale 
is correct or click the graphics window to place the pasted geometry.
Although importing geometry from AutoCAD can be an effi cient way to reuse existing 
AutoCAD fi les, experienced Inventor users generally prefer to model parts from scratch rather 
than import from AutoCAD. Importing from AutoCAD almost never provides results that are 
in line with the design intent of the part unless you just get lucky. Although you may fi nd this 
to be helpful initially, you will learn that importing AutoCAD fi les has a place in Inventor but 
should not be used as a substitute for creating robust parametric Inventor models.
Creating and Using 3D Sketches
3D sketches permit the creation of nonplanar 3D features. 3D sketches are created in single-
part fi les only and comprise geometry located in various XYZ locations or points within the 

CREATING AND USING 3D SKETCHES | 123
fi le. Although a 3D sketch may lie in a 2D plane, in most designs that will not be the case. 3D 
sketches should never be used for creating geometry that could be created within the 2D sketch 
environment. The 3D sketch tool is accessible only from within the part environment; however, 
you can project geometry from an assembly into the part to create the 3D sketch.
Creating a 3D Path
3D sketches are often used to defi ne paths for modeling features such as sweeps and lofts and 
are generally created based on existing geometry. You can use a 3D sketch to create objects such 
as tubes, pipes, and wires as well as negative features such as cam paths, recessed parting lines, 
and so on.
In this exercise, you will use the 3D Line and Spline tools to create a path along which a pro-
fi le can be swept. This is a common use of 3D sketches. To start the exercise, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3h_016.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. On the 3D Model tab, select the Sketch panel and click the drop-down arrow below the 
Start 2D Sketch button. Then click the Start 3D Sketch button. Or right-click in an empty 
area of the graphics window and choose New 3D Sketch.
Notice that although this is a part fi le, it has some reference surfaces in it already. These 
were included simply to emulate a situation where you might be creating a part within 
the context of an assembly. You will learn more about creating parts within an assembly 
in the chapters to come.
There is also a 2D sketch called Profi le1 already in the Model browser; you’ll use this 
sketch at the end of this exercise. Your goal is to create a 3D sketch running from the 
center of the connection input of the box through each of the large holes in the fl ange 
brackets.
 
4. On the 3D Sketch tab, click the drop-down arrow on the Spline tool button to reveal the 
Control Vertex and Interpolation spline options; then select the Interpolation option. 
You’ll see the 3D coordinate triad appear.
 
5. With the Spline tool still active, select the Draw panel bar to reveal the fl yout menu and 
then click the Precise Input button.
Now you will see the Inventor Precise Input toolbar appear. The Precise Input toolbar 
allows you to enter coordinates to move the 3D triad. The triad displays the x, y, and z 
planes and the corresponding axes in the form of three arrows. The red arrow indicates 
the x-axis, the green arrow indicates the y-axis, and the blue arrow indicates the z-axis. 
Notice that the triad is fi rst positioned at 0,0,0.
 
6. Specify a start point for the spline by clicking the front, circular edge of the connection 
input.
 
7. Click the center of the large hole of the fi rst triangular fl ange bracket. It makes no differ-
ence whether you choose the front or back edge of the hole.
 
8. Do the same for the other two fl ange brackets.

9. Right-click and choose Create to complete the spline.
 
10. Right-click again and choose Cancel to exit the Spline tool. Your screen should look 
similar to Figure 3.67.

In the next section, you will add a 3D line to your 3D spline.
Using the 3D Coordinate Triad
Before continuing with the 3D sketch, take a moment to explore the 3D coordinate triad and its 
functionality. Each part of the triad is selectable for different tasks, as you’ll see in the coming 
paragraphs. Figure 3.68 shows the anatomy of the triad.

3. Click the endpoint of the spline to set the start of the line on this point.
You will see the triad move to the spline endpoint. Notice that the triad is not lined up to 
be truly perpendicular with the bracket fl ange. To remedy this, you will use the Precise 
Redefi ne button found on the Precise Input toolbar. Your goal is to set the X (red), Y 
(green), and Z (blue) arrows of the triad to the orientation shown in Figure 3.69.

4. Select any of the arrow shafts.
 
5. On the Precise Input toolbar, click the Reposition Triad button, as shown at the top of 
Figure 3.69.
 
6. Select the shaft of the red X arrow and then click one of the bottom edges of the triangu-
lar fl ange bracket, as shown in Figure 3.69.
Note that if your X arrow faces the opposite direction, you will repeat steps 4 and 5 and 
select the other edge along the bottom of the bracket.
 
7. Next, click the Reposition Triad button again, and this time select the shaft of the green Y 
arrow.
 
8. Click one of the small edges on the sides of the fl ange, as shown in Figure 3.69.
Again, if the result of your selection leaves your Y arrow facing the opposite direction, 
you will repeat steps 7 and 8 and select another edge along the side of the bracket.
Once the triad orientation is set so that it matches Figure 3.69, you will draw a line by 
entering coordinates.
 
9. Click the triad plane between the blue and green arrows to isolate that plane to sketch on.
The triad plane should highlight red and then stay highlighted when selected (although 
this highlighting can be diffi cult to see depending on the color scheme in use). When the 
plane is selected, you will see a 0 placed in the X cell of the Precise Input toolbar.

126 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
 
10. With 0 in the X input cell, enter 300 in the Y cell, enter 25 in the Z cell, and press Enter.
Note that you can press the Tab key to switch among the X, Y, and Z input cells. Values 
will be input as relative coordinates. Recall that with relative coordinates, the new input 
coordinate point is based on the previous point rather than the absolute 0,0,0 origin point. 
You will now have a line running from the end of the spline out at 300 mm in the y-axis 
with a 25 mm rise in the z-axis.
 
11. Still in the Line tool, right-click and ensure that Auto-Bend is selected in the context 
menu. Auto-Bend will place a radius at the corners in your line route. The default radius 
size can be set by selecting Document Settings from the Tools tab and then selecting the 
Sketch tab. Once bends are placed, they can be edited like any other dimension.
 
12. With the Line tool still active, click the plane between the green and red arrows on the 
triad to isolate the XY triad plane, and enter 200 in the X input, 200 in the Y input, and 
leave 0 in the Z input. Press Enter on the keyboard to set this line point. You will see a 
small dimensioned radius at the corner of your two line segments. This is a result of the 
Auto-Bend option.
 
13. Right-click and choose Cancel to exit the Line tool. Your 3D sketch should resemble 
Figure 3.70.

16. Right-click and choose Finish 3D Sketch.

CREATING AND USING 3D SKETCHES | 127
As a test to see whether you have successfully created your 3D sketch for its intended pur-
pose, run a sweep along the path. Recall that there is a 2D sketch named Profi le1 in the browser. 
This will be your sweep profi le, and the 3D sketch just created will be your path.
 
1. In the 3D Model tab’s Create panel, click the Sweep button. Profi le1 will be automatically 
selected as the sweep profi le unless you have another unconsumed, closed profi le sketch 
in your part, in which case you will need to select Profi le1 manually.
 
2. Once the profi le has been selected, ensure that the Path button in the Sweep dialog box is 
enabled and then click the 3D sketch you just created. Your sweep should look like 
Figure 3.72.
Figure 3.72
Sweeping along a 
3D sketch
You will look at the Sweep tool in more depth in Chapter 5, “Advanced Modeling 
Techniques.” As a fi nal note, the connection box and triangular bracket fl anges have been 
derived into this part fi le as a reference feature. In the real world, once you’ve fi nished with 
the part, you would locate that feature in the browser and turn off the visibility. To do this, 
in the browser expand the feature called DerivedPart1.ipt. Right-click the feature called 
Derived Work Body1 and uncheck the Visibility box. If you’d like, you can save and close 
the part.
Exploring More 3D Sketch Tools
In addition to the Line and Spline tools used for sketching 3D geometry, several tools permit 
you to include and combine existing geometry to create 3D sketch elements.
Including D Geometry
You’ll often need to use edges of parts as a path for another feature, in much the same way you 
project geometry in a 2D sketch. In a 3D sketch, however, you are not really projecting the geom-
etry onto a sketch plane but simply including it for use in your 3D sketch. To see how this works, 
follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3h_017.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.

Objective

128 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
This fi le has a 2D sketch named Lip Profi le already created and ready to be used in a 
sweep feature. However, before you can do that, you’ll defi ne a path along which to sweep 
the profi le.
 
3. On the 3D Model tab, select the Sketch panel and click the drop-down arrow below the 
Start 2D Sketch button. Then click the Start 3D Sketch button. Or right-click in an empty 
area of the graphics window and choose New 3D Sketch.
 
4. On the 3D Sketch tab, click the Include Geometry button. Next, click each edge along the 
curved edge, as shown in Figure 3.73, to defi ne the sweep path.
Figure 3.73
Including geome-
try in a 3D sketch
 
5. Once the edges are selected, right-click and choose Finish 3D Sketch.
The path created by including geometry could not have been created with a 2D sketch 
because it does not exist in a single plane. You can use this path to experiment with the Sweep 
tool to sweep the profi le along the path if you’d like. The Sweep tool is covered in more depth in 
Chapter 5.
Using an Intersection Curve
You can use a 3D sketch to fi nd the intersection of two surfaces, sketch profi les, work planes, or 
some combination thereof. The resulting sketch is fully associative and will update automati-
cally should the curves change. To see it in action, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3h_018.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of the Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. On the 3D Model tab, select the Sketch panel and click the drop-down arrow below the 
Start 2D Sketch button. Then click the Start 3D Sketch button. Or right-click in an empty 
area of the graphics window and choose New 3D Sketch.
 
4. On the 3D Sketch tab, click the Intersection Curve button.

Using the Project Curve To Surface Tool
You can fi nd intersections of curves and faces using the Project Curve To Surface tool in a 3D 
sketch. This tool outputs three variations of projected geometry. Geometry created using these 
tools will adjust if the original geometry changes. Or, if you desire, the link can be broken from 
the parent geometry to prevent it from adjusting automatically. To see it in action, follow these 
steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_3h_019.ipt in the Chapter 03 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. On the 3D Model tab, select the Sketch panel and click the drop-down arrow below the 
Start 2D Sketch button. Then click the Start 3D Sketch button. Or right-click in an empty 
area of the graphics window and choose New 3D Sketch.
 
4. On the 3D Sketch tab, click the Project To Surface button.
The fi rst output, Project Along A Vector, requires a face, a curve, and a direction. 
Projecting to a continuous face such as a cylinder results in a 3D sketch entity that follows 
the surface as if the curve were slicing straight down through the face.
 
5. Click the face of the cylinder.
 
6. Click the Curves button. Note the Direction button, which allows you to change the pro-
jection direction. In this case, the default direction will work, so you can leave this as is.
 
7. Click the line on the far left.
The second output is called Project To Closest Point and projects curves in the shortest 
possible path normal to the surface. The result of a 3-inch line to a convex surface would 
be a curve less than 3 inches because the endpoints of the line would take the shortest 
path to the curve rather than wrapping about it.

Figure 3.75 shows all three outputs; note the different outputs created from three identical 
lines. You can break the link of the projected curves by locating the curves in a 3D sketch from 
the Model browser, right-clicking them, and choosing Break Link. You must have the sketch 
active for edits to break the link. Doing this disallows the ability for the projected curves to 
update if the founding geometry is updated.

Using a Helical Curve
You can create 3D helical curves such as thread paths and coils by using the Helical Curve tool 
within the 3D sketch tools. Helixes can be specifi ed by pitch and revolution, pitch and height, 
revolution and height, or a true spiral. A helix can be combined with other 3D sketch objects 
to compose as complex a path as required. Follow these steps to explore using the Helical

jected curves to update if the founding geometry is updated.
Refining and Constraining a D Sketch
You can anchor and constrain a 3D sketch in much the same fashion as you do a 2D sketch using 
dimensions and constraints. Additionally, with 3D splines you can add vertex points and control 
curve fi t with handles. Further refi ning can take place because you can adjust the fi t method and 
spline tension to create the exact curve shape desired.
Best Practices for Working with Sketches
Here is a list of points to remember as you continue working with sketches in Inventor. Keep in 
mind that sketches are the foundation for good modeling, and therefore the importance of creat-
ing stable, fully constrained sketches cannot be overstated.
 
◆
Keep sketches simple.
 
◆
Your goal should always be to have a fully dimensioned and constrained sketch.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 133
 
◆
Sketches that are not fully constrained tend to distort unpredictably when you make modi-
fi cations and updates.
 
◆
Rough out size and shape before adding dimensions and constraints to avoid distorting 
the sketch when dimensions and constraints are added.
 
◆
Add dimensions to lock down shape and then come back to change the size.
 
◆
Endpoint, midpoint, center, and intersection snap points can be helpful when creating 
sketch entities, but be aware of how they affect dimensions compared to selecting the line 
itself rather than the snap points.
 
◆
You can use the Backspace key to clear the last-selected points. For instance, if you select a 
point for the end of a line and then realize you should have selected another point instead, 
use the Backspace key to clear the fi rst selection and then start the line where it should 
have been.
 
◆
Use centerlines to defi ne revolution axes and diametric dimensions.
 
◆
Use construction lines to further defi ne sketches and create “helper” geometry.
 
◆
When you need to select multiple sketch entities, you can use a crossing selection or a win-
dow selection. A crossing selection is created from right to left and selects any object that is 
touched or contained by the window. A window selection is created from left to right and 
selects only objects that are completely contained in the window.
 
◆
Use the Delete key on the keyboard to quickly remove accidentally created geometry.
 
◆
Use the Split tool rather than the Trim tool when you can because the Split tool does not 
break previously defi ned constraints.
 
◆
Turn off automatic edge projection to avoid extra sketch geometry and project only the 
edges you need. This will make sketches easier to edit.
 
◆
Reserve fi llets and chamfers for the feature level whenever possible. Although you can fi llet 
and chamfer at the sketch level, it is generally best to keep your sketches simple and fi llet and 
chamfer the solid features rather than the sketches.
 
◆
You can create pattern and mirrored geometry in the sketch, but it is generally best to make 
a simple sketch, then create a feature from it, and fi nally pattern or mirror the feature. The 
results are often the same, but the feature patterns are much easier to edit.
Th e Bottom Line
Set up options and settings for the sketch environment.  Understanding the settings 
and options that apply to the sketch environment is an essential fi rst step in working with 
Inventor.
Master It  You want to confi gure your own set of options and settings for your sketch 
environment and then back them up and/or distribute them to other workstations. How 
would you do this?

134 | CHAPTER 3 SKETCH TECHNIQUES
Create a sketch from a part fi le template.  Creating a sketch in a blank template fi le is the 
fundamental step in creating 3D parametric models. You will use this basic step to start most 
of your part designs.
Master It  How would you capture the intent of your design when creating a base sketch 
for a new part?
Use sketch constraints to control sketch geometry.  Understanding what each sketch con-
straint does when applied will allow you to determine when to use each type. Recall that 
often more than one constraint will work in any given situation.
Master It  How would you create a sketch that allows you to test “what if?” scenarios 
concerning the general shape and size of your part?
Master general sketch tools.  Learning the features and tricks of the sketch tools will allow 
you to master Inventor sketching.
Master It  You are given a print of mixed units to work from, and you need to enter di-
mensions exactly as they are on the print. You understand that you can enter any dimen-
sions in any unit simply by adding the correct suffi x. But how would you create a radius 
dimension on a circle or a dimension from the tangents of a slot?
Create sketches from AutoCAD geometry.  You can use existing AutoCAD fi les to create a 
base sketch for an Inventor model of the same part.
Master It  You have many existing 2D AutoCAD drawings detailing legacy parts. You 
want to reuse these designs as you convert to 3D modeling. How would you proceed?
Use 3D sketch tools.  Much of working with a 3D parametric modeler can be done by 
sketching in a two-dimensional plane and then giving depth to the sketch to create 3D fea-
tures. However, sometimes you need to create paths or curves that are not planar. In those 
cases, you use the 3D sketch tools.
Master It   You know the profi le of a complex curve as viewed from the top and side. 
How would you create a 3D sketch from this data? 

Chapter 4
Basic Modeling Techniques
This chapter covers the principles of creating a 3D parametric part with the Autodesk® 
Inventor® and Autodesk® Inventor LT™ programs, which makes it one of the most important 
chapters in this book. You’ll start by looking at the general options and settings associated with 
Inventor and part fi les and then move on to a basic exercise exploring the fundamentals of cre-
ating parametric models. Then you’ll take a deeper look at the options found in the primary 
feature tools.
All the skills in this chapter are primarily based on creating a single part, whether in a 
single-part fi le or in the context of an assembly fi le. Do yourself a favor and learn or review 
these basics before jumping into the more complex features.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

Exploring Application Options and Settings for Part 
Modeling
As in previous chapters, you should make sure your settings in the Application Options dialog 
box match the approach we’re using in this book. This will ensure that the examples you work 
on will match the results you see here.

136 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Specifying Global Settings
You maintain global settings for Inventor within the Application Options dialog box. For this 
section of the chapter, you will be concentrating on the Part tab, which allows you to maintain 
part-specifi c settings. You can adjust the application settings as follows:
 
1. On the Tools tab, click Application Options.
 
2. Choose the Part tab, as shown in Figure 4.1.
Figure 4.1
Th e Part tab
The Part tab settings have the following functions:
Sketch On New Part Creation  This section allows you to predetermine the origin plane in 
which to place the fi rst sketch. If No New Sketch is selected, Inventor will create a new part 
fi le without an initial sketch. You can then determine the origin plane for the fi rst sketch.
Construction  The Opaque Surfaces setting determines whether created surfaces will be 
translucent by default or as opaque as parts are. The Enable Construction Environment set-
ting allows you to work with the construction environment tools when repairing imported 
surface models. 
Auto-Hide In-Line Work Features  This option allows automatic hiding of a work feature 
when it is consumed by another work feature. For instance, if you create a work plane by 

EXPLORING APPLICATION OPTIONS AND SETTINGS FOR PART MODELING | 137
clicking a work axis and a work point, the work axis and work point will be stacked under 
the work plane in the browser.
Auto-Consume Work Features And Surface Features  This option allows Inventor to 
 consume surfaces when converted to a solid in addition to consuming work features.
Display Extended Information After Feature Node Name In Browser  This option allows 
you to see more information about each browser feature. In addition to the names of part 
features, the size and settings of the feature will be shown to allow better identifi cation of the 
part features. This option can be toggled on and off from the Browser Filters menu as well 
as through the Application Options dialog box. Be aware that you cannot edit the content or 
format of the feature name extensions.
3D Grips  These settings affect how 3D grips can modify a part fi le. In normal use, you can 
modify part features by selecting and dragging a 3D grip. If a dimension is controlling the 
feature, the dimension will update to refl ect the changes in the part.
If Never Relax is selected, any features controlled by the dimension will not change.
When Relax If No Equation is selected, a dimension value will update unless that dimension 
value is determined by an equation. Selecting Always Relax will always allow the use of 3D 
grips, even when controlled by an equation. The Prompt setting will prompt you to accept 
any changes during drag operations.
The settings in the Geometric Constraints area control how constraints will be handled dur-
ing drag operations. Never Break prevents grip editing when sketch constraints are control-
ling a sketch. Always Break allows constraints to be broken as required during grip edits. 
The Prompt setting asks you to make a decision on a case-by-case basis for each grip edit.
Specifying Document-Speciﬁ c Settings
To change the options in a specifi c part fi le, you’ll need to access the part’s Document Settings 
dialog box by selecting the Tools tab and clicking Document Settings while that part is open. 
The Document Settings dialog box that opens allows specifi c settings for an individual fi le in 
the following areas:
 
◆
Lighting styles
 
◆
Materials
 
◆
Units
 
◆
Modeling dimension display values
 
◆
Individual sketch settings
 
◆
Model values
 
◆
Bill of materials (BOM)
 
◆
Default tolerances

138 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Any changes made in the part’s Document Settings dialog box will be applied only to the 
current document. Current document settings will not affect the settings in other parts within 
an assembly.
The Standard Tab
Figure 4.2 shows the part’s Document Settings dialog box with the Standard tab active. The 
Standard tab controls the active lighting style of the current graphics window. In addition, you 
can set the physical material properties and the display appearance of the current part here.
Figure 4.2
Th e Standard tab in 
a part’s Document 
Settings dialog box
The lighting style is selected from a preset list in the drop-down menu, as is the physical 
material. The display appearance is confi gured by clicking the Settings button and adjusting the 
various settings in the resulting dialog box. To use the display appearance settings confi gured 
in the part fi le, you must fi rst select the Display tab of the Application Options dialog box and 
select Use Document Settings.
The Units Tab
The settings on the Units tab allow you to change the unit specifi cation values, as shown in 
Figure 4.3. For example, you could open a metric (mm) part and change the input settings to 
inches.
The Units tab settings have the following functions:
Modeling Dimension Display  These settings allow you to defi ne the model dimension’s 
display precision by the number of decimal places and defi ne how that dimension will 
be displayed. Many people prefer the Display As Expression setting because it shows the 
dimension name along with any expression that exists in the dimension; if no expression 
exists, the dimension name and dimension value are displayed.
Default Parameter Input Display  These settings allow you to see the parameter name in 
the input box when you’re editing a dimension or feature input. Figure 4.4 shows the option 
set to display as the expression on the left and set to display as the value on the right. You can 
also access this setting from the context menu.

The Sketch Tab
On the Sketch tab, shown in Figure 4.5, you can adjust how the 2D sketch tools work and appear 
in an active sketch. In addition, you can change the preset value for Auto-Bend Radius in the 3D 
Sketch area.
Here are the Sketch tab settings along with a description of their functions:
Snap Spacing  This option allows you to set the spacing between snap points to assist with 
precise layouts. For instance, if you are using Frame Generator to create a steel frame with 
uprights at 2000 mm on center, you might set the snap spacing to 2000 mm and then on the 
Sketch tab in the Application Options dialog box, set the sketch to Snap To Grid. Then, when 
creating your skeletal base sketch, you can set line segments and spacing to 2000 mm with 
precision.
Grid Display  These settings allow you to set the major and minor grid spacing. If Snaps 
Per Minor were set to 2 with the 2000 mm snap spacing used in the previous example, the 

140 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
spacing between grid lines would be 4000 mm. If Major Every were set to 5, distance between 
the major grid lines would be 20,000 mm. To display grid lines, you select the Sketch tab in 
the Application Options dialog box.
Line Weight Display Options  These options allow the display of unique line weights in 
model sketches. Note that this does not infl uence line weights in printed model sketches. 
Display True Line Weights displays line weights on-screen as they would appear on paper 
regardless of the on-screen zoom level. Display Line Weights By Range displays line weight 
according to the entered values.
3D Sketch  This area contains only one setting, Auto-Bend Radius. When creating a 3D line, 
you can turn on the Auto-Bend Radius option and have intersecting line corners automati-
cally rounded. This setting controls the default radius at which bends are created. Once they 
are made, the bends can be edited to a different value.

Document Settings
The Modeling Tab
Figure 4.6 shows the Modeling tab, which allows changes to the behavior while modeling the 
current active part. Note that if you are using Inventor LT, some of these settings might vary or 
might not be present.
Here are the settings found on the Modeling tab of the Document Settings dialog box:
Adaptively Used In Assembly  This option is available only when a part is adaptive. When 
it is deselected, an adaptive part becomes static. This setting can also be controlled by right-
clicking an adaptive part in the assembly browser.
Compact Model History  This option allows Inventor to purge all rollback document his-
tory when you save the current fi le. Compacting the model history improves performance in 
large assembly fi les. You should select this option only when performance is affected in large 
assembly fi les or when existing disk space is limited.

Advanced Feature Validation  This option permits Inventor to use a different algorithm to 
compute features. Using this option can produce more accurate feature results in rare cases 
such as Shell, Draft, Thicken, and Offset features. However, this option is slower in calcula-
tion than the default option and should be used only on rare occasions where the accuracy of 
the model may be in question.
Maintain Enhanced Graphics Detail  This option enables graphics information to be saved 
with the fi le on disk. This information is used in the graphics display if the display quality is 
set to Smoother in the Application Options dialog box.
Participate In Assembly And Drawing Sections  When this option is not selected, the part 
will default to None in the section participation settings of an assembly or drawing section 
view. However, you can adjust each instance of the part to section or not section as needed. 
For instance, if you created a part fi le for an O-ring and intended to use it in the design of 
several shaft assemblies, you could deselect this option in the O-ring fi le to ensure that the 
O-ring remained unsectioned in the section drawing views of the shafts you used the O-ring 
on. If you needed to show a particular section view of the shaft assembly with all parts sec-
tioned, you would do so by setting the section participation settings for the O-ring to section 
in that one section view of the drawing.
Tapped Hole Diameter  This option determines how the size of tapped hole features are 
controlled. Thread representations in drawings are generated correctly only when Tapped 
Hole Diameter is set to Minor.

142 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
User Coordinate System  Click the Settings button to access the UCS Settings dialog box, 
where the UCS naming prefi x can be set, the default plane defi ned, and the visibility of UCS 
and its features determined.
3D Snap Spacing  These options establish the spacing between snap points in 3D sketches. 
The settings also control the snap precision when the Move Bodies tool is used to free-drag a 
solid body.
Initial View Extents  These options set the initial visible height and width of the graph-
ics window when you’re creating a model from a template. For instance, if you create a lot 
of steel frames, you may fi nd it helpful to create a template with the setting adjusted so that 
your initial sketch is not always zoomed in to a very small area. Confi gure these settings in 
your template fi les to affect new fi les. You can set the initial height and width of the graph-
ics window. The settings affect only the initial sketch when a template is used. When you’re 
creating a secondary sketch or opening an existing part, the view is controlled by the size of 
the part.
Naming Prefi xing  These options set the default fi le-naming convention for parts generated 
from multi-body part designs. These tools are covered in Chapter 5, “Advanced Modeling 
Techniques.”
Make Components Dialog  Clicking Options in the Make Components Dialog area opens 
the Make Components Options dialog box. The Make Components settings shown in the 
options dialog box are specifi c to the active project. These options are employed when creat-
ing multi-body parts, as described in Chapter 5.
The Bill Of Materials Tab
The Bill Of Materials tab determines the structure of the current fi le and how that structure 
relates to the bill of materials in an Inventor assembly. Figure 4.7 shows the default settings for 
structure and quantity.
You can add BOM structure properties to individual parts in the Document Settings dialog 
box. Figure 4.7 shows the choices available in a model or assembly fi le for setting individual fi le 
properties. 
Figure 4.7
Bill Of Materials tab

EXPLORING APPLICATION OPTIONS AND SETTINGS FOR PART MODELING | 143
Here are the details:
Normal  These components are given an item number and included in quantity calcula-
tions. The placement of normal parts in the bill of materials is determined by the parent 
assembly properties. A normal subassembly may be composed of any combination of insepa-
rable, phantom, purchased, and reference parts without having any effect on how those parts 
are listed in the BOM. Normal is used for most components.
Inseparable  These components are assemblies that allow the inclusion of press-fi t, glued, 
welded, or riveted components that might be damaged if taken apart. A good example is a 
hinge that is fully assembled but should be listed in the BOM as a single part. Although the 
Inseparable structure is listed in the part’s Document Settings dialog box, it is intended as an 
assembly property.
Purchased  These components are parts that are not normally fabricated or manufactured 
by your company but instead purchased from vendors. Any purchased component, whether 
part or assembly, will be listed in a parts-only parts list. A purchased component assembly 
will not normally have the component parts listed in the BOM because that component will 
be purchased as a single unit.
Phantom  These components exist in the design but are not included as specifi c line items in 
the BOM. A construction assembly that exists as a container (subassembly) within a higher-
level assembly, simply to hold a number of components together for assembly purposes, can 
be set to Phantom. When this assembly is set to Phantom, it will not appear in the parts list; 
however, the parts included within the construction assembly will be listed as individual 
parts. Phantom components are ignored by the BOM. No item number is assigned, and no 
quantity calculations are performed on the phantom assembly. However, the quantity of 
individual parts contained within the phantom assembly will be multiplied by the quantity 
of the phantom component included in the top-level assembly.
Reference  These components are used to provide reference information within an assem-
bly design. An example of a reference part might be a product container placed in a conveyor 
assembly. The conveyor components are the parts and assemblies you are designing, but the 
container is required to ensure the clearance and function of your design. In a drawing, ref-
erence parts will be indicated in the view as hidden line geometry. Reference components are 
excluded from the BOM and are excluded from quantity, mass, and value calculations.
Base Quantity  Use this to change how the part's Base Quantity property is displayed in the 
BOM or parts list. You can change the value from Each to any parameter, such as one called 
Length. You will fi nd that components generated by the Frame Generator tools are automati-
cally set to use a length parameter for the base quantity. Once a parameter is selected, you 
can change the Base Unit, from mm to M for example.
The Default Tolerance Tab
Figure 4.8 shows the Default Tolerance settings. Creating tolerance values affects sketches and 
parts only. When you add tolerance values to a part fi le, you can select either Use Standard 
Tolerancing Values or Export Standard Tolerance Values, or you can select both options.

144 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES

Default Tolerance tab 
in Document Settings
You can select the Use Standard Tolerancing Values box to use the precision and tolerance 
values set in this dialog box. You can select the Export Standard Tolerance Values box to export 
tolerance dimensions to the drawing environment.
Once you’ve selected an option, you can then add linear or angular tolerance values. You can 
add any number of tolerance values by precision to this part. When you have added your values 
to the part, click the Apply button to stay in the dialog box and apply the new settings to this 
tab, or click the OK button to apply the settings and exit the dialog box. Chapter 5 covers the use 
and setup of part tolerances in more detail.
Key Concepts for Creating Basic Part Features
Inventor 3D part modeling is based on the principle of creating a base feature and then adding 
features to the base feature to build a more complex part. Figure 4.9 illustrates the basic work-
fl ow for creating a part composed of multiple features.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR CREATING BASIC PART FEATURES | 145
Create Your Own Template Files
Th is may seem like a lot of settings, and it’s true there are a lot, but you need to set them only once. 
Open a template, adjust all your settings the way you want them for a particular type of part (for 
instance, an inch unit part), and then use the Save Copy As Template option. Your settings will then 
be available in a template when you create a new part. Make another template for metric parts. 
Make another for sheet-metal parts, and so on, as you like. You can make as many as you think 
you’ll use, each with its own set of document settings speciﬁ c to the template.
A good idea is to make a folder in your template directory named, for example, My Templates, and 
store all your templates in it. Th is folder (and any other folder in the template directory) will show 
up as a tab in the New File dialog box. Th is way, you will still have access to Inventor’s standard 
templates as well as your custom templates.
You can set the template ﬁ le location in two places:
 
◆
On the Tools tab of the ribbon, click Application Options and select the File tab in the dialog 
box that opens.
 
◆
On the Get Started tab of the ribbon, click Projects and select the Folder Options entry in the 
dialog box that opens.
Keep in mind that if the settings in these two locations are not the same, Inventor will use the 
Projects setting.
As you create parts in Inventor, keep in mind the following concepts because each will go a 
long way toward making your modeling endeavors more productive:
 
◆
Anchor and orient your base sketch to the 0,0,0 origins of the part fi le. This will make your 
parts much easier to manage as you go forward. The base feature will generally be the larg-
est feature in the part, unless you have a specifi c reason for not making it so.
 
◆
Look for areas of your design that are likely to change and create your part features to 
accommodate these future edits. For example, the plate thickness might change as loads 
are determined throughout the rest of the design. Creating the plate sketch from the end 
view and then extruding the length would make it easy to modify the length of the plate 
but not as easy to modify the thickness. Therefore, a better choice would be to create the 
base sketch of the top view and extrude the thickness.
 
◆
Identify relationships between design parameters. For instance, there may be a require-
ment that the distance from the edge of a part to the edge of a bolt hole always has to be two 
times the diameter of that hole. You can set that formula directly in the distance dimen-
sion, and then whenever you change the hole diameter, the distance from the edge adjusts 
automatically.
 
◆
Keep an eye out for patterned and symmetrical design features. It is much easier to create 
and modify the fi rst instance of a pattern than it is to edit several identical features that 
were created separately.

146 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
◆
Build logical feature dependencies. Features are considered dependent on other part 
geometry when you cannot delete or modify a portion of the part or feature without affect-
ing another feature built later in the part. For example, if you were to create a simple block 
and then create an additional feature on that block, you could not delete the block without 
upsetting the new feature.
 
◆
Because fi llets and chamfers often change, it is best to place them at the end of the design 
process as much as possible. Placing them at the beginning and then having to change 
them is likely to upset other features you have created afterward that might depend on the 
fi lleted or chamfered edges.
 
◆
Create simple sketches to create simple features to create complex parts. Using numerous 
features within a 3D model allows simplifi ed control over modifi cations of the model in the 
future. Separate features may be suppressed or modifi ed to alter the design without having 
to make changes in a complicated sketch. Instead of attempting to create all the geometry 
in a single sketch, analyze the proposed part fi rst and create a simple base sketch for the 
fi rst feature.
Consider Modeling vs. Machining
Although the “design as you’d manufacture” paradigm is a great philosophy to follow when creating 
3D parts, there are diﬀ erences between modeling and machining. One major diﬀ erence is that you 
have the ability to add material when modeling, whereas a machining operation only takes away 
material. Deciding which route to take depends on what resources are available in your shop and 
how much time you have.
Modeling and machining are important subjects to consider when designing parts. Inventor oﬀ ers 
a lot of features that may make it easy to design a part that might be impossible or at least very 
expensive to make with the tooling equipment your shop has available. In some cases, although a 
part may be easier to model as one piece, it might be less expensive to machine as multiple pieces. 
Also, consider the size of the equipment and tooling, such as end mills and drills, when creating 
parts. For example, in Inventor you can create very small ﬁ llets or square corners in a design, but 
try to machine a 0.010 inch ﬁ llet in a cavity that is 3 inches deep, and you’ll likely earn a scolding 
from the people on the shop ﬂ oor who are required to turn your design into reality.
One example for how to make a realistic design for your shop is the ﬁ xture block, as shown here. If 
a CNC machine center is available, this simple part is easy to model in Inventor and not a problem 
to create in the shop.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR CREATING BASIC PART FEATURES | 147
However, without a CNC approach, even this simple model might prove to be diﬃ  cult and/or expen-
sive to produce by more traditional machining techniques. Reconsidering the design to match the 
shop’s abilities will be required. In this case, you might consider a sandwich block design of simple 
parts welded and fastened together to achieve the same end result, as shown here.
Although this might require more thought and planning on your part within Inventor, it will make 
the design achievable with the tools and technology at hand. Often the best resource for helping 
you determine what your shop’s capabilities are will be the people who will be making the parts.
Simplifying Your Sketches
When learning to master creating parts in Inventor, there is probably no concept more impor-
tant than the idea of creating simple sketches from which to build simple features that will add 
up to create complex parts. Standard 2D drafting practice requires you to place all part details or 

148 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
components within a single view. However, it is not good practice to use the same 2D drafting 
workfl ow within any feature-based 3D modeler. Complicated sketches can drag down sketch-
ing performance and virtually eliminate easy changes to features. Consider the part shown in 
Figure 4.10. This illustration shows the base sketch that is then revolved to form the shaft.
Figure 4.10
A complex sketch for 
a revolved part
Now compare the same part modeled using the simple-sketches approach shown in 
Figure 4.11.

placed features create

The version in Figure 4.10 would prove diffi cult to modify because of the number of sketch 
constraints and dimensions required to create it. Most likely a seemingly simple change would 
result in some part of the sketch breaking. By comparison, the version in Figure 4.11 would be 
easy to modify because each feature is broken out into its own sketch or placed feature.

EXPLORING THE EXTRUDE TOOL | 149
Of course, sometimes creating a more complex sketch is required, but if you follow the 
simple-sketch rule of thumb, you will fi nd Inventor much more accommodating, and you will 
quickly master part creation and be ready to tackle complex sketches when they are needed.
At the end of this chapter you will fi nd an exercise that builds a part by fi rst creating a simple 
sketch and constructing a base feature from it. The exercise continues adding simple features 
to build complexity into the part. But before you get to that exercise, you’ll fi nd several shorter 
exercises exploring many of the tools used to create part features. If you have not already down-
loaded the Chapter 4 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015, please refer to the 
“What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the download and setup instructions.
Exploring the Extrude Tool
The Extrude tool allows you to add volume to a closed sketch profi le to create a 3D solid and 
allows you to add length to an open sketch profi le to create a 2D or 3D surface. You can also use 
the Extrude tool to create cutouts in solids.
To truly master the Extrude tool, you have to understand several options. In the next several 
pages, you will open a series of fi les that have been set up to demonstrate the various options 
available to you. You can fi nd all of these fi les in the Chapter 04 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
Marking Menus
If you have the marking menus enabled and customized, you should be prepared to interpret the 
instructions in this book concerning right-clicks to match what you see on-screen.
If you prefer, you can disable the marking menu and use the classic context menu by clicking the 
Customize button on the Tools tab. On the Marking Menu tab, you will ﬁ nd an option called Use 
Classic Context Menu.

150 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Extruding Basic Features
The Extrude tool is often used to create base features on which other features are created. To 
explore the creation of a base extrude feature, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_008.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
Because the sketch in this part fi le contains fi ve profi les from which you can choose, the 
Extrude tool requires you to select the profi le or profi les you want to extrude. Note that 
the large, dashed circle in the center of the hexagon is not recognized as a profi le because 
it is set as a construction line in the sketch.
Use Sketch Center Points to Create Profiles
In Sketch1 of mi_4a_008.ipt, you might have noticed the presence of four sketch center points 
at the intersection of the hexagon and the two circles. Sketch center points placed at the intersec-
tion of overlapping proﬁ les allow Inventor to see the proﬁ le as separate sketch proﬁ les, without 
the need to split or trim the sketch geometry.
 
3. Hover your cursor over each profi le to see it highlight.
 
4. Click in the center of the hexagon, and you will see a preview of the extrusion that will be 
created from this profi le.
 
5. Click and drag the arrow at the center of the preview to change the extrusion distance 
and/or direction.
 
6. Use the Flip button to change the direction of the extrusion so that it goes down away 
from the sketch, as shown in Figure 4.12.
Figure 4.12

extrude feature
 
7. Set the extrude Distance to 25 mm and then click the OK button.
Notice that a feature called Extrusion1 has been created in the Model browser tree. If 
you click the plus symbol next to it, you’ll see that Sketch1 is listed under it, because 
Extrusion1 consumes Sketch1.

9. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
10. Set the extrude Distance to 60 mm and ensure the direction is facing up, as shown in 
Figure 4.13; then click the OK button.

Creating basic extrusions from a sketch profi le is quite a simple operation and one that you 
will use often in creating your designs. You can close the part without saving changes and con-
tinue to explore the Extrude option.
Direct Manipulation Tools
Th e Direct Manipulation toolset is a set of user interface tools enabling you to modify a model while 
viewing the changes in real time. Th e buttons on the in-canvas display correspond to the buttons 
and inputs found in dialog boxes and menus. You can choose to use the Direct Manipulation tools, 
or you can use the traditional dialog boxes and menus to achieve the same result.
Th e Direct Manipulation In-Canvas Display consists of selection tags, manipulator arrows, value 
input boxes, and mini-toolbars.

Once you become comfortable with the Direct Manipulation tools, you can use the arrow at the 
bottom of the dialog box of each tool and choose to roll it up to save screen space. Note that you 
cannot disable the Direct Manipulation tools.
One tip to be aware of is the ability to pin the Direct Manipulation mini-tools in place. For instance, 
you can drag the mini-toolbars to the upper-right corner of your graphics screen, near the ViewCube®, 
and then use the options menu pull-down button to select the Pin Mini-Toolbar Position option. 
Doing so will ensure that these tools will appear in this location each time you use the tool.
Editing an Extrusion Feature
Once you create extrusions, you can quickly and easily modify them by using the same inputs 
used to create the original feature. In the following exercise, you’ll open an existing part and 
edit an extrusion feature in order to change the length of the part:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_009.ipt.
 
2. Locate the feature named Extrusion2 in the Model browser and then double-click it or 
right-click and choose Edit Feature.
 
3. Set the Distance to 100 mm and then click the OK button.
 
4. Expand the Extrusion1 node in the browser to reveal Sketch1.
 
5. Right-click it and choose Edit Sketch, or double-click it to edit the sketch.
 
6. Edit the Hex_Size dimension by right-clicking or double-clicking it; then set it to 30 mm.
 
7. Click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch and set the change.
Continued

EXPLORING THE EXTRUDE TOOL | 153
Making edits to existing extrusions features is as simple as editing the extrusion feature or 
the sketches used to create them. You can close the part without saving changes and continue to 
explore the Extrude option.
Extruding with Cut and Taper
You can use the Extrude tool’s Cut option to remove material from your parts. Although you 
may think of this as a tool to create holes, keep in mind that Inventor’s Hole tool is the better 
choice to create standard holes because of the advanced detailing functions that accompany the 
Hole tool. With that said, the Cut option in the Extrude tool will allow you to cut material using 
any sketched profi le that you might come up with. To explore the Taper option in the Extrude 
tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_010.ipt.
 
2. Click Extrude on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. Select the rectangle shape for the extrude profi le (if it does not select automatically) and 
set the distance to 20 mm.
 
4. Choose the Cut option and just drag the manipulator arrow down into the part; notice 
that the preview turns red and the direction automatically switches. Change the direc-
tion so the preview is going up out of the part and then click the OK button.
 
5. Note that an error is generated, and it states that the feature you specifi ed did not change 
the number of faces. Keep this in mind as you use the Extrude tool. Inventor will gener-
ally set the correct direction for you, but occasionally you might need to set the direction 
manually. Click the Edit button to return to the extrude options.
 
6. Change the direction again so you are indeed cutting the part and adjust the distance to 
20 mm as required.
 
7. Click the sphere on the manipulator arrow or click the More tab, as shown in Figure 4.14.

Extruding with Intersect
So far you have created extrusion features using the Join option and the Cut option. Next, you 
will use the Intersect option of the Extrude tool to modify an existing solid. The Intersect option 
allows you to select a sketch profi le and keep only material that intersects the existing solid 
and the sketch profi le. You can create complex shapes by sketching an intersect profi le and then 
using the extrude Intersect option to keep the combined volume of the existing solid and the 
sketch profi le, as shown here:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_012.ipt.
 
2. Click Extrude on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
Rather than cutting the small profi les out of the existing part, you’ll use the Intersect 
option to discard all areas of the part that are not common between the existing part and 
the current sketch.
 
3. Select the large H-shaped sketch profi le.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to All.
 
5. Click the Intersect button, make sure the extrude direction is going down through the 
existing part, and then click the OK button.
 
6. Click the end-of-part marker in the Model browser and drag it down below the sketch 
called Slot Locations so the Slot Locations sketch is visible and available for use.
This sketch consists of several small slots. You could select each slot and cut it from the 
existing part, but doing so would be time-consuming and subject to a missed selection, 
which will give you errant results. Instead, you’ll use the Intersect option to choose the 
area between the slots.
 
7. Click Extrude on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
8. Select anywhere in the rectangular sketch profi le so the selection results in a rectangle 
with the slots are omitted.
 
9. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to All.
 
10. Click the Intersect button, make sure the extrude direction is going down through the 
existing part, and then click the OK button.

EXPLORING THE EXTRUDE TOOL | 155
For another example of using the Intersect option, take a look at using it to create the tapered 
corners on a common hex head bolt, as demonstrated in the following exercise:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_013.ipt.
 
2. Click Extrude on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. Select the visible sketch for the extrude profi le (if it’s not automatically selected).
 
4. Set the distance to 100 mm.
 
5. Click the Intersect button, and make sure the extrude direction is correct. You want the 
extrusion going down though the bolt head and shaft.
 
6. Click the sphere on the manipulator arrow or click the More tab in the dialog box.
 
7. Enter 30 in the Taper input box, as shown in Figure 4.16, and click the OK button.
Figure 4.16
A tapered intersec-
tion extrusion
Your extrude options create a cone with a 30° taper, and the Intersect option keeps only the 
volume of the part shared by the existing features and the intersect cone feature, in this case 
the entire bolt except the tapered corners of the hex head. When fi nished, you can close the part 
without saving changes.
Extruding Surfaces from Open Proﬁ les
In addition to creating solids with the Extrude tool, you can create surfaces. If the profi le is open 
and there is no other geometry to relate to, the surface solution is automatically selected. 
For closed profi les, you are required to switch the output from solid to surface manually, as 
shown here:

6. To explore how to create a surface extrusion from a closed profi le, right-click Sketch2 in 
the browser and turn on the visibility.
 
7. Select the Extrude tool, and notice that Inventor automatically selects the profi le and sets 
the output to Solid in the dialog box.
 
8. Click the Surface button to change the output to an extruded surface and then change the 
Extents option to To.
 
9. Doing so allows you to specify a point or surface to extrude to. You might notice that the 
surface created in the previous step was created in two halves. Select the arc-shaped half 
(rather than the spline-shaped half), and notice that the preview terminates as if the arc 
half-wrapped around.
 
10. Deselect the check box next to the To selection arrow (the Terminate Feature On Extended 
Face check box), and you will notice that the preview terminates at the farthest extent of 
the selected surface, matching the spline shape.
If you receive an error stating that the attempted surface did not terminate the tool body, 
review step 5 and ensure that your fi rst extrusion was set to extrude symmetrically from 
the original sketch.
 
11. Click the OK button to create the extruded surface.
Figure 4.18 compares the two termination solutions when using the To option. Keep in mind 
that although this example used surface extrusions, the To option works the same for solids. You 
can close the fi le without saving changes.
Extruding Solids from Open Proﬁ les
In addition to extruding surfaces from open profi les, you can extrude solids, provided suffi cient

To take a look at the Match Shape option and how it can be used to change the output, you’ll 
open a fi le that has two possible solutions for the fi nal matched shape. One solution will 
match the shape of the existing geometry, and the other will not. Follow these steps to see how 
this works:

3. Click the visible profi le sketch in the center of the part.
 
4. You’ll notice that Inventor attempts to create a closed profi le from this open profi le by 
extending the profi le past the extents of the existing geometry. Select the profi le on the 
side with the grid feature.
 
5. Change the Extents drop-down to Distance, enter 1 mm, and click the OK button. Notice 
how the extrusion fi lls the shape of the part.
 
6. Edit the extrusion you just created, and deselect the Match Shape box in the dialog box. 
Then click the OK button.
 
7. You’ll notice that the extrusion runs through the grid feature, ignoring the shape.

Extruding with To
It is often helpful to extrude to existing geometry rather than entering a distance value. In this 
way, if the existing feature changes, so too will your extrusion. When you use the Extrude To 
option, you can extrude to faces and vertices as well as work planes and work points. In the fol-
lowing exercise, you’ll explore the Extrude To option:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_020.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select one of the rectangular profi les.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to To.
 
5. Select the yellow face, and click the OK button.
You will receive an error stating that the termination plane does not completely termi-
nate the profi le, because of the way that the yellow face would wrap around in a circle if 
extended.
 
6. Click the Edit button in the error dialog box to return to the Extrude dialog box.
 
7. Uncheck the Terminate Feature On Extended Face check box in the Extents area, as 
shown in Figure 4.21, and then click the OK button.

10. Select the red face, and you will see that the preview terminates along the extended 
red face.
 
11. Uncheck the Terminate Feature On Extended Face check box in the Extents area, and you 
see the preview extend to the yellow face.
 
12. Click the OK button to create the extrusion. You can close the fi le without saving changes.
Although in this case the results of the two extrusion features are the same, you can see that 
the selected termination face and the termination check box can provide different results when 
used in combination.
Follow these steps to take a look at some other Extrude To options:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_022.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select one of the ellipse-shaped profi les.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to To. Select the yellow face and ensure that 
the Terminate Feature On Extended Face check box is checked. In this case, you would 
receive an error if this check box were not selected. Figure 4.22 shows the correct selections.

5. Click the OK button, and you’ll see that the ellipse face takes on the angle of the face to 
which you extruded.
 
6. Use the Extrude tool again, select the other ellipse profi le, and change the Extents drop-
down from Distance to To. This time select the work point for the terminating object and 
click the OK button.
 
7. You’ll see that the ellipse extrudes up to the work point height, as shown in Figure 4.23. 
Figure 4.23
Extruding to a point
Although in this case you’ve used a work point to extrude to, often you can use the vertex 
point of an existing feature to extrude to. Feel free to experiment with this part and extrude 
shapes to an existing point on the yellow face. When fi nished, you can close the fi le without 
 saving changes.
Extruding with the Minimum Solution Option
Often when extruding to a cylindrical face, you will need to set the extrusion to solve for the 
minimum solution since the face is continuous all the way around. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_024.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select the hex-shaped profi le.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to To, select the outside face of the 
 cylinder, and then click the OK button.
You will notice that the hex shape stops at the closest face of the pipe. This is because the 
Minimum Solution option is the default. However, if the goal were to extend the profi le 
to the farthest extent of the cylindrical face, you would need to adjust the settings to the 
farthest extent of the cylindrical face.
 
5. To fi x this, edit the extrusion you just created and click the More tab (or click the sphere 
on the on-screen manipulator arrow).
 
6. On the More tab, select the Minimum Solution check box, as shown in Figure 4.24, and 
then click the OK button.
You’ll see that without the Minimum Solution option selected, the extrusion extends to the 
far side of the selected face. You can close the fi le without saving changes.

Extruding with To Next
Similar to extruding to a selected entity, you can use the To Next option and let Inventor auto-
matically select the next available surface or face for you. It should be noted that solutions with 
through voids may not work with this option. To explore the Extrude tool’s To Next option, fol-
low these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_026.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select the rectangular profi le marked Profi le1.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to To Next, and click the OK button.
 
5. Repeat the same steps for Profi le2. When you click the OK button, you will receive an 
error because the extrusion cannot build to this solution.
 
6. In the error message dialog box, click the Edit button and then set the extrude extents 
to To.
 
7. Select the back (yellow) face for the face to extrude to and then click the OK button.
Oftentimes the geometry may require a bit of experimenting to achieve the solution you 
want. Just knowing the abilities and limitations of each option goes a long way toward knowing 
how to proceed. You can close the fi le without saving changes. Figure 4.25 shows the results of

Extruding Between
You may need to defi ne the beginning and the end of an extrusion that are not common to your 
sketch plane. To do this, you can use the Between option:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_028.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select Circle.
 
4. Change the Extents drop-down from Distance to Between.
 
5. Select both pipe-shaped pieces to defi ne the From and To options.
 
6. Because you are extruding to hollow objects, you’ll need to use the Minimum Solution 
option. Click the More tab, and make sure the Minimum Solution check box is selected.
 
7. Flip the direction using a direction button next to the Minimum Solution check box. Click 
the OK button.
Figure 4.26 shows the results of using the Between extents option. You can close the fi le with-
out saving changes.

Extruding Multi-body Solids
You may have noticed a couple of other buttons in the Extrude dialog box, one called Solids and 
the other called New Solid. Figure 4.27 shows both buttons in the dialog box. These options 
allow you to create separate solid bodies within the part or choose which existing solid bodies 
to modify.
The fi rst option allows you to select the solids you want to modify. Use this when selecting 
multiple solid bodies in which to create a cutout feature, for instance.
When selected, the second option allows the Extrude tool to create a separate solid body, 
rather than creating a feature of an existing solid. Separate solids can then be moved, rotated, 
colored, and modifi ed individually.
To explore the multi-body extrude options, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_030.ipt.
 
2. Click the Extrude button on the 3D Model tab (or press E on the keyboard).
 
3. For the profi le, select the visible rectangular sketch profi le (if it is not automatically

6. On the Modify panel of the 3D Model tab, click the Combine button.
 
7. Choose the new solid for the Base selection and choose the original solid (the one with 
the yellow face) as the Toolbody selection.
 
8. Set the operation to Cut (middle button).
 
9. Select the Keep Toolbody check box and then click the OK button.
You should see the original solid disappear and the new solid result in a dovetail where it 
intersected with the fi rst. Expand the Solid Bodies folder and ensure that you have two 
solid bodies still. If not, use the Undo button and repeat steps 6 through 9.
 
10. Right-click either of the solids and choose Show All to turn the visibility of the solid 
back on.
Next you’ll use an existing sketch to cut a notched edge into both of the solid bodies at 
the same time.
 
11. Locate the sketch named Base Inset Sketch in the Model browser, right-click it, and select 
Visibility.
 
12. Using the Extrude tool, set the operation to Cut and then use the Solids button (found 
under the Profi le button) to select both dovetailed bodies.
 
13. Set the distance value to 3 mm and then click the OK button.
You can use the ViewCube to examine the resulting cut. You’ll learn more about multi-body 
parts in Chapter 5, including how to use the Make Components tool to write out each solid body 
as an individual part fi le. You can close the fi le without saving changes.
Creating Revolved Parts
Creating turned and revolved parts is a regular occurrence in many engineering departments 
because of the types of parts designed and manufactured. The parts consist of circular features 
around a common axis. There are two different workfl ows for creating circular parts, each with 
its own advantages and disadvantages. Creating threads on a part presents another challenge.
You can create circular parts using a single sketch and revolving it around a centerline axis. 
Alternatively, you can create multiple circular extrusions to produce the same part.
There are also two different workfl ows for creating threaded features on a part. You can add 
threaded features to any circular component by means of the Thread feature, which creates cos-
metic threads on the part, or through the use of the Coil feature, which creates physical threads. 
Typically, physical threads are created only when that geometry is required for the model. 
Generally, using cosmetic threads is suffi cient because they are an intelligent feature that can be 
retrieved in the detail drawing of the part and called out as per the specifi cations of the feature.

CREATING REVOLVED PARTS | 165
Revolved Cylindrical Parts vs. Stacked Circular Extrusions
Revolved cylindrical parts utilize a sketch with a center axis. Figure 4.30 illustrates two ways to 
create the same sketch. The view on the left shows a sketch profi le anchored at the origin and 
dimensioned from the origin. The view on the right illustrates the same sketch anchored at the 
origin but dimensioned from a created centerline, which creates diametric dimensions. The two 
sketches will create the same revolved feature, the difference being that the centerline allows 
you to dimension the sketch using diameter dimensions to maintain the design intent of 
the part.
Figure 4.30
Dimension to the 
sketch vs. centerline
You create the centerline by using the Line tool with the Centerline tool toggled on. In this 
example, the centerline was created starting at the origin point and continuing to the right of 
the sketch, extending beyond the sketch for selection ease. When dimensions are created on the 
sketch and terminated at the centerline object, they will actually extend to the other side of the 
revolved part diameter.
You could create most revolved shapes by extruding sketched circles as well, but it’s often 
best to use a revolve feature instead. The advantage of creating a revolved profi le rather than 
creating stacked circular extrusions is that the relationship of every portion of the sketch can be 
easily visualized from the start. The disadvantage is that a contour sketch is not always easily 
edited to remove or change a portion of the feature. In addition, if the sketch is not fully dimen-
sioned and constrained, it can create errors down the line with faces and edges. For this reason, 
you should always fully dimension and constrain your sketches. Figure 4.31 shows the same 
part modeled using both approaches.

Creating Revolved Parts
Revolved features can be used to create parts or features, and they can be created as solids or 
surfaces. Follow these steps to see how revolves are created:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_032.ipt.
 
2. Select the Revolve button on the 3D Model tab.
 
3. For the profi le, select the rectangular sketch profi le and the small circle.
 
4. Click the Axis button in the Revolve dialog box and then select the line indicated on the 
part for the axis.
 
5. Set the operation to Cut so that you are milling out the revolved profi le.
 
6. By default the Extents drop-down is set to Full, giving you a 360-degree revolve. In this 
part, though, a full revolve cut would cut away a portion of the existing part. So, you will 
set the Extents drop-down to Angle instead. Notice the other extents options available. 
They should all look familiar as options from the Extrude tool.
 
7. Set the angle to 180 and then click the OK button. Figure 4.32 shows the revolve options.

This demonstrates how to create a revolved cut at a specifi ed angle. You can close this fi le 
and continue to explore the use of the Revolve tool to create surface features.
Next, you’ll use the Revolve tool on an open profi le to create a revolved surface. You’ll then 
use a tool called Thicken to turn the surface into a solid.
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_034.ipt.
 
2. Before creating the revolve feature, you need to supply the sketch with some missing 
dimensions. To do so, right-click Sketch1 in the browser and choose Edit Sketch.
 
3. Place dimensions from the points shown in Figure 4.33 to the centerline, and you’ll 
notice that because the line is a centerline type, the dimensions are automatically diam-
eter dimensions. Before placing the dimension, you can right-click and choose Linear 
Dimension if a diameter is not the correct choice.

6. Click the Axis button and then select the centerline.
 
7. Because the sketch was an open profi le, the Surface output is automatically selected. Click 
the OK button to create the revolved surface.
 
8. Next, you’ll add some fi llets. On the 3D Model tab, click the Fillet button and click the 
intersecting circular edges on the surface feature.
 
9. In the Fillet dialog box, change the radius to 12 mm and then click the OK button.
 
10. In the Modify panel on the 3D Model tab, use the fl yout menus to locate the Thicken/

Creating Work Features
A work feature is construction geometry used when part geometry is not present to create new 
features. There are three types of work features: work planes, work axes, and work points. In 
addition to work features that you might create, each part contains origin planes, axes, and an 
origin point. You can view these by expanding the Origin folder in the Model browser (as shown 
in Figure 4.35), right-clicking each feature, and selecting Visibility. Note that in Figure 4.35 the 
3D indicator arrows have been drawn in for clarity. If it helps you, though, you can turn the indi-
cator on and have it display in the lower left of your screen by selecting the General tab of the 
Application Options dialog box.

Features panel.
 
3. Click the Midplane Of Torus button.
 
4. Select anywhere on the torus, and the plane will be created.
Workplane Tips
Here are some other points to remember about work planes:
 
◆
You can right-click a work plane in the browser or the graphics window and then select 
Show Inputs to see how that work plane was created.
 
◆
You can move a work plane by clicking an edge and dragging. This will slide the work 
plane in the plane of its defi nition only.

CREATING WORK FEATURES | 175
 
◆
When you place the mouse pointer on any corner of the work plane, a resize arrow appears, 
allowing you to drag the corner of the work plane to resize it.
 
◆
You can also right-click and set a work plane to autoresize, allowing it to resize off the 
extents of the part as it changes.
 
◆
Work planes have a positive side and a negative side to them. The normal (positive) side 
has an orange tint, and the non-normal (negative) side has a blue tint. You can right-click a 
work plane and choose Flip Normal if needed.
 
◆
If you do not have the geometry you need present when creating work planes, you can 
right-click and choose Create Axis or Create Point to create an in-line work feature. In-line 
features are stacked in the Model browser and automatically set not to display.
 
◆
When you start the Work Plane tool, you can right-click and choose Repeat Command to 
set the work feature tools to stay on until you right-click and choose Done. This helps when 
you are creating a lot of work features because you do not have to keep clicking the button 
each time.
Work Axes and Work Points
Much like a work plane, a work axis or work point can be used to create helper geometry in your 
model. Work points are often created in order to defi ne work planes or work axes. Work axes are 
often created to help defi ne work planes.
Work Axes
A work axis is a construction line of infi nite length that is attached to a part based on the geome-
try used to create it. You can create a work axis on linear edges through circular faces and edges;

Work Points
Work points can be created at the intersection of planes, surfaces, edges, work axes, 2D or 3D 
sketch lines, work points, and sketch points, in any combination. They can also be placed 
directly on sketch points, vertex corners, center points, edge midpoints, or grounded work 
points. You can locate several input-specifi c buttons for creating work axes by clicking the fl yout 
button next to the Axis button, as shown in Figure 4.37.
Figure 4.37
Methods for creating 
work points
Grounded Work Points
Grounded work points are much like regular work points, but they have all of their degrees of 
freedom removed and are therefore locked to a specifi c coordinate. To edit a grounded work 
point, you can right-click it, choose 3D Move/Rotate, and then use the precise input toolbar to 
make adjustments. You can right-click a regular work point and choose Ground to convert it to a 
grounded work point.
Renaming Work Features
Taking the time to rename work features can be helpful if you fi nd that you must create and 
edit a lot of them. However, if you use just one or two here and there, it may not be that helpful. 
Using a consistent naming scheme will help you easily determine the work feature’s use.
Creating Fillets
The Fillet tool in Inventor may seem daunting at fi rst because of the number of buttons and the 
combination of options, but once you understand the layout of the dialog box and the intended 
use of the options, you’ll be able to create fi llets of all types. There are three basic types of fi llets:
Certiﬁcation
Objective

CREATING FILLETS | 177
Edge Fillets  These are fi llets created based on selected edges.
Face Fillets  These are fi llets created between two faces or face sets.
Full Round Fillets  These are fi llets that are tangent to three adjacent faces or face sets.
When you start the Fillet tool (on the Modify panel of the 3D Model tab), it will default to 
edge fi llets. You can switch the fi llet type by using the buttons on the left of the dialog box.
Work Feature Visibility vs. Display
Many Inventor users ﬁ ght the control of visibility of work features (work planes, work axes, and 
work points) because of a lack of understanding of the tools available to control it. Th ere are basi-
cally two methods of preventing work features from displaying on-screen:
 
◆
Right-click the work feature and toggle oﬀ  Visibility. (Always use this at the part level.)
 
◆
On the View tab, click Object Visibility and then use one of the options listed. (Do not use this 
at the part level but only at the assembly level.)
Both methods turn oﬀ  the display, but only the ﬁ rst toggles the visibility setting for each object. 
Th e second is a display override that suppresses the work feature display but does not change the 
visibility setting.
Th e diﬀ erence between the two methods becomes important at the assembly level. If you’ve used the 
Object Visibility tool to “override” the work feature visibility setting at the part level, you will ﬁ nd 
that all of the work features will display when you place the part into an assembly. Th is requires you 
to toggle them all oﬀ  again at the assembly level, and you will be required to do so for each instance 
of the part placed. You could use the Object Visibility tool in the assembly and suppress the display 
of all the work features for the entire assembly, but doing so doesn’t allow you to access one or two 
work features at a time. As a result, you end up with all or none of the work features displaying.
To properly control work feature visibility, you should develop the habit of always right-clicking 
the work features at the part level and explicitly toggling oﬀ  the visibility setting, and never use 
the Object Visibility override in a part. If you do this, then when the part is used in an assembly, 
you can control the work features on an individual basis, per instance of the part. Th en you can use 
the Object Visibility tool to toggle all the visible work features on and oﬀ  eﬀ ectively.
Edge Fillets
Edge fi llets are the most common type and therefore naturally have the most options. When 
edge fi llet is the active type, you’ll see three tabs across the top of the dialog box, allowing you 
to set the following edge fi llet subtypes: constant, variable, and setbacks.
Constant Fillets
Constant fi llets have the same radius along the entire length of the edge. On the Constant tab, 
you can select a group of edges and then set the radius and type. You can create a new size 
group by clicking the Click To Add row in the selection pane and changing the radius size. 
Figure 4.38 shows two constant fi llet groups being created. In this case, each group contains 
only one edge, but they vary in radius.

Figure 4.38
Creating two edge ﬁ l-
lets of diﬀ erent sizes
Fillet Failures
If you attempt to place multiple ﬁ llets at once, you might be alerted to the fact that some of the 
edges could not be blended successfully using the current radius size, in which case you can choose 
to place the successful ﬁ llets and skip the others.
One of the most common issues with edge ﬁ llets arises when you select multiple edges that converge 
on a single corner vertex. Unfortunately, when this happens, the error message might erroneously 
indicate an issue with the ﬁ llet size. However, you can generally resolve this issue by removing one 
or more of the competing edges from the selection, applying the ﬁ llet feature, and then applying 
another ﬁ llet feature using the previously removed edges. Keep this in mind as you place edge ﬁ l-
lets, and remember that just because you can place multiple sizes of edge ﬁ llets all in one feature 
doesn’t mean it’s always the best solution.
Also on the Constant tab you can change the selection method from Edge to Loop or Feature. 
Figure 4.39 shows the selection method set to Feature and the results of selecting a hole. Note 
that all edges created by the hole feature are selected.
Figure 4.39
Fillet selection by

CREATING FILLETS | 179
You can also select All Fillets (inside corners) or All Rounds (outside corners) to apply fi llets 
to a part quickly, where it makes sense to do so. Figure 4.40 shows the same part with all fi l-
lets applied on the left and all rounds applied on the right. Keep in mind that you can select all 
rounds and fi llets at once as well.
Figure 4.40
All ﬁ llets vs. all 
rounds
Variable Fillets
In contrast to constant-edge fi llets are variable-edge fi llets. Variable-edge fi llets can have mul-
tiple radius sizes along the length of the edge. To create variable fi llets, click the Variable tab and 
then select an edge to make it variable. By default, the start points and endpoints are added to 
the right pane. You can add points by simply clicking the edge in the place or places you want to 
transition to a different radius.
Once points are selected, you can change the radius and position of each point. The number 
listed in the Position column is a decimal percent of the edge length rather than the length. For 
instance, Figure 4.41 shows a point has been added at 0.5 ul or 50 percent of the edge length 
coming off the start end. Recall that ul is simply Inventor’s abbreviation for unitless, which is 
automatically applied to parameters that do not require a unit suffi x.
Figure 4.41
A variable-edge ﬁ llet

180 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Setbacks
Setbacks defi ne the corner where multiple-edge fi llets come together. Once you select edges 
in the Constant tab, you can switch to the Setbacks tab and select corners to apply setbacks to. 
Setbacks are typically used for cast and molded parts where the corners cannot be too sharp.
On the Setbacks tab, select a corner using the Vertex pane fi rst. Then enter a setback distance 
for each edge. Setback values should be no longer than the length of the edge they are placed 
on. You will typically get an error if you attempt to specify a value that is larger. If you click 
the Minimal check box, the setbacks will automatically adjust to the smallest length that can be 
built. Figure 4.42 shows a setback being created, along with the result.
Figure 4.42
A setback ﬁ llet
Face Fillets
Face fi llets are added between two selected face sets. These faces or sets of faces do not need to 
share a common edge. You can adjust the radius once the fi llet is previewed, but typically if you 
do not get a preview, it indicates an invalid selection set. You can add more faces, or you may 
need to use a different type of fi llet solution.
Two options are selected by default:
Include Tangent Faces  Use this option to allow the fi llet to continue over tangent, adjacent 
faces. Deselect this option to ensure that the fi llet is only between selected faces.
Optimize For Single Selection  Deselect this option when making multiple selections per 
face set. When this option is selected, the selection automatically changes from selection set 1 
to selection set 2.
Figure 4.43 shows a face fi llet created between the two dark faces.
Full Round Fillets
Full round fi llets can be used to quickly round over a feature without having to know the radius 
that would complete the full round. You can also use this option to create a full round on faces 
that are not parallel. To create this type of fi llet, simply select the faces in the order in which they 
occur from side to center to other side, and the center face will be replaced with the radius face.

Working with Fillet Features
In this section you’ll create the various types of fi llets discussed in the previous pages. To begin, 
open the fi le mi_4a_053.ipt. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Fillet tool on the Modify panel of the 3D Model tab (or press F on the 
keyboard).
 
2. You’ll create a simple edge fi llet. Select the vertical edge where the yellow and blue faces 
intersect.
 
3. Set the fi llet radius to 18 mm and click the Apply button.
 
4. Next, you’ll create a variable fi llet. Click the Variable tab in the Fillet dialog box.
 
5. Select the edge where the purple and red faces intersect.
 
6. Set the radius for the start and endpoints to 2 mm.
 
7. If needed, click the word Start to set the dialog box from edit mode back to selection 
mode and then click anywhere on the edge between the purple and red faces.

182 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
8. Change the radius to 6 mm and then set the position to 0.5 to set the new variable point 
to be halfway between the start and endpoints. Note that you could add additional vari-
able points to further defi ne the variation of the fi llet. In this case, though, just click the 
Apply button to create the variable fi llet.
 
9. Next you’ll create a fi llet setback. To do so, switch back to the Constant tab and set the 
radius to 2 mm.
 
10. If needed, click the Pencil icon in the current row to set it from edit mode to 
selection mode.
 
11. Select the edge between the yellow and pink faces and then the edge between the yellow 
and green faces. It may help to zoom in on the corner.
 
12. In the Fillet dialog box, click the Click To Add text to add another row to the list.
 
13. Change the radius to 3 mm and then click the Pencil icon to set the row back to selection 
mode, if needed.
 
14. Select the edge between the pink and green faces.
 
15. Select the Setbacks tab in the Fillet dialog box.
 
16. Choose the corner where the yellow, pink, and green faces intersect. You should see the 
vertex highlight as you locate it.
 
17. Enter 6 mm for all of the setback values and then click the Apply button to create the fi l-
lets with setback.
 
18. Next, you’ll create a face fi llet. Click the Face Fillet button on the left of the Fillet dialog 
box (the one in the middle).
 
19. For Face Set 1, choose one of the orange faces; for Face Set 2, choose the other. Then click 
the Apply button.
 
20. And fi nally, you will create a full round fi llet. Click the Full Round Fillet button on the 
left of the Fillet dialog box.
 
21. Select the tan faces on the protruding front feature in consecutive order (the right face 
for Side Face Set 1, the top face for Center Face Set, and the left face for Side Face Set 2, for 
example).
 
22. Click the OK button to create the fi llet and close the Fillet dialog box.
Take a look at the fi llet features in the browser tree. You can right-click any of them and 
choose Edit Feature to adjust the fi llet as needed. To add edges to or remove edges from any 
given fi llet feature, you can use the Ctrl key and then click the edges on-screen. Figure 4.45 
shows the part before and after fi llets were applied. You can close the fi le without saving 
changes.
Note that if you try to place a fi llet along the edges where the pink and red faces intersect, 
you will receive an error because of the way the resulting fi llet tapers. However, if you also 
choose the corresponding edges on the opposite of the rounded feature, the fi llet will build 
without problems. Keep this in mind as you work with fi llets that form sharp tapers.

Color Overrides
To change the color of any individual face on a model, you can right-click the face and choose 
Properties from the context menu. You can do the same for entire features by right-clicking them 
in the browser and choosing Properties.
To remove color overrides for entire solids, you can expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, 
right-click a solid, and choose Properties. In the Body Properties dialog box, you can set Body 
Appearance to As Part, select the Clear All Overrides check box, and then click the OK button. Be 
aware that parts translated from other ﬁ le formats often come in with many color overrides and 
the Clear All Overrides action can take a while to process.
Creating Th readed Features
Inventor offers the option of creating cosmetic threads that represent actual threads in the part, 
and it creates 2D geometry information for detailing those threads. Cosmetic threads are cre-
ated with a threaded hole feature. Or you can use the Thread tool on the Feature panel bar to 
add threads to existing part features. The thread features are added to the Model browser as 
separate features.
Creating Cosmetic Th reads Using the Th read Tool
Creating cosmetic threads on a circular part is a relatively simple procedure. Cosmetic threads 
work by wrapping a scaled graphic around the feature to represent threads. This allows the 
model fi le size to stay smaller because it is not required to calculate all of the extra edges and 
faces of the threads. However, the cosmetic Thread tool does create fully intelligent thread fea-
tures based on the specifi cations you choose, allowing you to detail the threads quickly and 
accurately in the drawing environment.
In the following steps, you will use the Split tool to divide a cylindrical surface into multiple 
faces and then apply cosmetic threads to them:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_056.ipt.
 
2. On the 3D Model tab fi nd the Modify panel and then look for the Split tool in the fl yout 
menus (look under the Combine or Thicken/Offset button). Once you’ve found it, click 
the Split button. 

184 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
3. Select Work Plane1 for the Split tool, select the face of the cylinder it runs through, and 
then click the OK button.
 
4. Right-click the edge of Work Plane1 and choose Visibility to turn the plane off. Recall that 
work planes are selectable only by their edges.
 
5. Now that the part is divided into two faces, look for the Thread tool in the fl yout menus 
(look under the Shell or Draft button). Once found, click the Thread button and select the 
shortest face.
 
6. Click the Specifi cation tab, set Size to 17 and Designation to M17x1, and then click the 
Apply button.
 
7. Switch back to the Location tab and click the end of the middle cylinder.
 
8. Uncheck the Full Length check box and enter 5 mm for the Offset and 30 mm for the 
Length. Click the direction button if you do not see the threads appear. Click the Apply 
button.
 
9. Run your mouse pointer over the third cylinder, and notice that as you get closer to one 
end or the other, the offset and direction switch.
 
10. Click the face and apply another set of threads of any type you like; when you’ve fi n-
ished, click the OK button. Figure 4.46 shows the Thread tool options.
Figure 4.46
Placing cosmetic 
threads
3D Threads from Your Cosmetic Threads 
Unless you are going to actually cut threads directly from your 3D model, cosmetic threads are 
usually suﬃ  cient. Th e advantage of these threads is that they contain all the thread information 
in the model that can later be extracted in a drawing without carrying the burden of complex 
modeling features.
Inventor pulls its thread speciﬁ cation information from the Thread.xls ﬁ le found in the Design 
Data folder. You can edit this ﬁ le to contain custom thread speciﬁ cations and include proprietary 
threads or industry-speciﬁ c threads not commonly listed.
If you ﬁ nd that you do need to generate 3D threads from your cosmetic threads, maybe for a 3D 
printed part, for example, you can download the Th readModeler tool from the Autodesk Exchange 
Apps website: http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com.

CREATING THREADED FEATURES | 185
Using the Coil Tool to Create Physical Th reads
In addition to using the ThreadModeler add-in tool found at the http://apps.exchange
.autodesk.com website, you can create physical threads using the Coil tool. Physical threads 
create large fi le sizes compared to cosmetic threads and can seriously affect performance and 
assemblies. As a result, physical threads should be used only where absolutely necessary, such 
as in the design of a bottle or jar top or other geometries such as a worm gear. You can explore 
the creation of a physical thread with the Coil tool in these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_4a_057.ipt.
 
2. In the Model browser, select the sketch called Thread Cut Sketch, right-click, and select 
Edit Sketch.
 
3. Right-click and choose Slice Graphics (or press F7 on the keyboard) to temporarily slice 
away the material that hinders your view of the sketch. Recall that this option is available 
only while creating or editing a sketch that runs through a solid.
 
4. Zoom in on the sketch, change the depth dimension to 2 mm, and then click the Finish 
Sketch button to exit the sketch.
 
5. Zoom out (or double-click the mouse wheel to zoom all) and then locate and click the Coil 
tool in the fl yout menu found on the Create panel (look under the Sweep button).
 
6. Select the sketch profi le if it does not automatically select and then select the work axis in 
the center of the cylinder for the axis.
 
7. Use a direction button to make sure the coil is running the correct way and then click the 
Cut button.
 
8. Click the Coil Size tab, change the pitch to 4 mm and the revolution to 12, and then click 
the OK button.
Figure 4.47 shows the Coil Size tab. Be aware that you can create coils by specifying pitch 
and revolution, revolution and height, and pitch and height, or by defi ning a spiral. Also note 
the suffi x of ul shown in the Revolution drop-down box. This suffi x just means that the value is 
unitless. You do not have to specify this because Inventor will do so as needed.

Hole Features
Using Inventor’s Hole tool, you can create counterbore, countersink, spotface, and drilled holes 
with user-defi ned variables such as thread designation and drill point angle. You can also spec-
ify a simple hole, a tapped hole, a tapped tapering hole, or a clearance hole.
Using the Th read and Clearance Spreadsheets
Two external fi les are related to the Hole tool: Thread.xls and Clearance.xls. Both fi les load 
at the time of installation to a Design Data folder in the install directory location, such as 
C:\Users\Public\Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Design Da-ta\XLS\en-US. If the 
Design Data folder has been relocated, you can determine its location by following these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Projects.
 
2. In the Projects dialog box, ensure that you are looking at the correct project and locate 
and expand the Folder Options node in the lower pane.
 
3. Note the Design Data path listed.
 
4. If the Design Data path says = Default, then your project is reading the path from 
Inventor’s options, so you should select the Tools tab, click Application Options, and 
select the File tab in the dialog box that opens. Note the Design Data path listed.
Once the path is determined, you can browse to the path and fi nd the thread and clearance 
spreadsheets and make customizations as follows. To edit the thread spreadsheet, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Close Inventor.
 
2. Make a copy of the original spreadsheet and store it in a safe location (this is just a 
precaution).
 
3. Open the Thread.xls fi le in Microsoft Excel.
 
4. To add or modify custom thread designations for an existing thread type, do the 
following:
 
a. Choose the worksheet you want to customize.
 
b. Edit the values in the Custom Thread Designation column to include your designa-
tions. These will then be available in the Thread and Hole tools and can be recovered 
in hole notes in a drawing.
 
c. Edit cell B1 to change the name Inventor displays in the Hole and Thread tools.
 
d. Edit cell D1 to change the order in which Inventor lists the thread types in the Hole 
and Thread tool dialog boxes.
 
5. To add a new thread type, complete these tasks:
 
a. Copy an existing worksheet of the same type (parallel or taper).
 
b. Rename the custom worksheet as required.
 
c. Delete most or all of the rows below row 3. You may want to keep at least one row to 
use as a reference, at least temporarily.

Creating Holes in Parts
You have four options for placing holes with the Hole tool:
 
◆
From Sketch
 
◆
Linear
 
◆
Concentric
 
◆
On Point
To explore these placement options, open the fi le mi_4a_055.ipt from the Chapter 04 folder 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 directory, and follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Hole tool on the 3D Model tab (or press H on the keyboard).
 
2. You’ll notice that the Placement option is set to From Sketch. This is because Inventor has 
detected that there are two sketches available for use. Click Cancel to exit the Hole tool.
 
3. Right-click Sketch5 in the Model browser and choose Visibility to turn the visibility of 
this sketch off.
 
4. Start the Hole tool again. This time Inventor detects that there is only one sketch available 
and automatically selects the center point found in that sketch.
 
5. Click the counterbore option, set the counterbore (as shown in Figure 4.48), and then click 
the OK button.

Objective

188 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
6. Right-click Sketch5, turn the visibility back on, and then click the Hole button again. 
Notice that it selects the center points automatically again. This is helpful; however, you 
do not want the hole in the hex-shaped cutout to be the same size as the others in this 
sketch. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the center point at that location to remove it 
from the selection.
 
7. Choose the spotface option, and notice that it is essentially the same as the counterbore 
with the exception of the depth measurement. In the spotface, the depth is measured 
from the bottom of the bore. Set the spotface as shown in Figure 4.49 and click the OK 
button.
Figure 4.49
Spotface settings
 
8. Since you removed the one center point before placing the spotface holes, you will reuse 
that sketch to place the next hole. To do so, that sketch must be visible. The Hole tool has 
toggled the visibility back off, so you need to locate Sketch5 again and make it visible.
 
9. Place a simple drilled hole using the center point in the hex-shaped cutout. Set the termi-
nation to Through All and the diameter to 9 mm, and click the OK button. Then turn the 
visibility of the sketch off one last time.
 
10. Start the Hole tool again. You’ll note that because there are no longer any visible sketches, 
the From Sketch option is no longer the default placement option. Set the placement to 
Concentric and select the top face of the part for the Plane input.
 
11. Next, you need to specify a concentric reference. Select one of the yellow faces (or the 
 circular edge of the yellow face).
 
12. Set the hole to the countersink option and then set the inputs as shown in Figure 4.50. 
Click the Apply button (not the OK button just yet).

13. Set the plane, use the other yellow face to place another countersink of the same size, and 
then click the OK button.
 
14. Change your view so that you can see the work point at the work axis intersection of the 
green face.
 
15. Start the Hole tool again and set the placement option to On Point.
 
16. Select the work point for the point input and then the work axis for the direction. Flip the 
direction if needed, using the button next to the Termination drop-down.
 
17. Leave the hole at the simple drilled option and set the Termination drop-down to To.
 
18. For the To selection, click the bore face of the counterbore hole and click the Terminate 
Feature check box.
 
19. Click the clearance hole option, set the options as shown in Figure 4.51, and click the 
OK button.

20. Rotate the part so that you can see the underside and zoom in on the feature with the 
red face.
 
21. Start the Hole tool again and select the red face for the Face input.
 
22. Select one of the longer straight edges for Reference1 and set the dimension to 8 mm. 
Select one of the shorter edges and set the dimension to 12 mm.
 
23. Set the termination to Through All and the hole type to Taper Tapped Hole.
 
24. Choose Din Taper from the Thread Type list, set the size to M5, and then click the OK 
button. You’ll note that the hole is cut with the appropriate taper.
You can close the part without saving changes when you have created all the holes.
As you can see, the Hole tool has an abundance of options allowing you to specify holes in a 
variety of ways. Keep in mind that features created with the Hole tool carry more intelligence 
with them than a simple circular extrude cut. This is particularly true when you begin to detail 
a part in the drawing environment.

190 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Setting Tolerance Values in Holes
You can set tolerances for hole dimensions in the Hole dialog box. When setting a hole dimen-
sion, right-click a dimension edit box and then select Tolerance, as shown in Figure 4.52.
Figure 4.52
Tolerance settings
You can use these general steps to access the tolerance settings:
 
1. In the Tolerance dialog box, change the values as desired:
 
◆
In Precision, click the arrow to set the decimal precision of the dimension.
 
◆
In Evaluated Size, select Upper, Nominal, Median, or Lower to use when evaluating 
the dimension. This will set the size at which the hole is actually created.
 
◆
In Type, click the arrow and select a tolerance type for the selected dimension.
 
2. Depending on your selection, enter values to set the upper and lower tolerance range and 
the tolerance for the hole and shaft dimensions (for Limits and Fits).
 
3. Click the OK button.
This will return you to the Hole dialog box. Keep in mind that although the value in the 
hole input will not change, the hole will be drawn to the tolerance you selected in the model. 
For instance, if the Upper option were selected in the hole shown in Figure 4.52, the hole would 
measure 6.012 mm rather than 6.000 mm. You’ll learn more about using tolerances in Chapter 5.
Bend Parts
You can use the Bend Part tool to bend a part based on a sketched bend line. You can specify the 
end of the part to bend, the direction of the bend, the angle, the radius, and the arc length. You 
can fi nd the Bend Part tool on the Modify tab of the 3D Model tab. By default, it is hidden from 
view and must be accessed by using the fl yout (the small black triangle on the Modify panel).

BEND PARTS | 191
Here are some guidelines to be aware of when using the Bend Part tool:
 
◆
Sketches used for bend lines must be visible and unadaptive and should be located on a 
plane or surface that contacts the part.
 
◆
A sketched line on the top face of a part does not allow for the part to be bent down, only 
up, whereas a sketch that runs through the part allows the bend to be built up or down.
 
◆
Bend Part does not account for bend allowances in the way sheet-metal features do and 
therefore should not be used with sheet-metal parts.
 
◆
You can specify the bend by Radius & Angle, Radius & Arc Length, or Arc Length & Angle.
Follow these steps to create a simple bend part:
 
1. Open the fi le named mi_4a_058.ipt.
 
2. Select the Bend Part tool from the fl yout of the Modify panel.
 
3. Select one of the sketch lines as the bend line.
 
4. Adjust the arrow buttons so that just the end is bent up. Notice that if you try to bend the 
end down, it will not work. This is because of the position of the sketch.
 
5. Set the radius to 100 mm and then click the OK button.
 
6. The bend will consume your sketch, so you will need to expand the Bend feature in the 
Model browser and then right-click the sketch and choose Share Sketch.
 
7. Create another bend to your specifi cations, experimenting with the other solutions.
Figure 4.53 shows the Bend Part tool in action. You can close the fi le without saving changes 
when fi nished.

Part Modeling Exercise
In the pages that follow, you will create a part similar to the part shown in Figure 4.54. You’ll 
employ some of the tools covered in this chapter and preview some that are covered in 
Chapter 5.
Figure 4.54
Th e part you’ll create 
in this exercise
Creating a Base Feature
You’ll begin by creating a new part fi le from the Standard(mm).ipt template:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the New button.
 
2. On the Metric tab of the New File dialog box, select the Standard(mm).ipt template.
 
3. On the Sketch tab, locate the rectangle drop-down menu (the small black arrow next to 
the Rectangle button) and click the Rectangle Two Point Center tool.
Projecting the Origin Point
If you do not see an origin point in your sketch, you may want to take this opportunity to turn on 
the option that will automatically project it into every new sketch. To do so, just follow these steps:
 1. On the Tools tab, click Application Options.
 2. Choose the Sketch tab.
 3. Ensure that the Autoproject Part Origin On Sketch Create option is selected and click the OK 
button.
 4. Start a new ﬁ le from a template, and you will see that the origin point is now present.

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 193
 
4. Place the rectangle on the projected origin point.
 
5. Use the Dimension tool found on the Sketch tab to dimension the sketch at 150 mm by 
300 mm, as shown in Figure 4.55.
Figure 4.55
Initial sketch
 
6. Right-click and choose Finish 2D Sketch; then click the Extrude button on the 3D 
Model tab.
 
7. If needed, click the corner of the ViewCube to fi nd an isometric view of the sketch so you 
can see the preview (if it’s not displayed, select the View tab, select the Windows panel, 
click the User Interface button, and click the drop-down arrow).
 
8. Generally, Inventor will select the profi le for you if you have just one closed profi le pres-
ent to extrude. If the profi le is not selected, click anywhere in the rectangle to select it. If 
you did not make the diagonal a construction line, you will need to select both triangular 
halves of the rectangle.
 
9. Enter 25 mm in the Distance input box. Click the arrow buttons to change the extrude 
direction just to see how the preview updates. Then click the left arrow button and click 
the OK button.
Creating a Second Feature
Now that you’ve created your base feature, you will continue by adding features to it. Before 
doing so, it is a good idea to save your part. Click the Save icon from the Quick Access bar at the 
top of the screen, or click the Inventor button and then select Save. You can save the fi le in the 
Chapter 04 folder and name it anything you like.
Now that the part is saved, it’s time to create a second feature:
 
1. On the 3D Model tab, click the Start 2D Sketch button and then click the large front face 
of the part (or right-click the face and select New Sketch). Sketch2 is now created and 
active.
 
2. Use the ViewCube to orient your view of the part so that you have a fl at 2D view of your 
sketch plane with the rectangle running horizontally on your screen.
 
3. If you see sketch lines outlining the base feature, then you have the Autoproject Edges 
For Sketch Creation And Edit option turned on. If you do not see those sketch lines, select 
the Project Geometry tool on the Sketch tab and select the face again to project the edges.

194 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Enabling Project Edges on Sketch Creation
If you see the outline of the faces automatically projected into your new sketches, you may want 
to consider turning it oﬀ . In general, I do not recommend you use this. It may be helpful in the 
beginning, but be aware that your sketches can become cluttered with unneeded geometry. When 
all edges are projected, it is more diﬃ  cult to determine the design intent and edit sketches. Instead, 
consider disabling this option and developing a practice of projecting only necessary edges.
To do so, follow these steps:
 1. On the Tools tab, click Application Options.
 2. Choose the Sketch tab.
 3. Ensure that the Autoproject Edges For Sketch Creation And Edit option is selected to enable it or 
deselected to disable it and click the OK button.
 
4. Sketch a rectangle on the face selected for the sketch. Place this rectangle in the middle of 
the face, being careful not to accidentally constrain it to the origin point or the edge of the 
base feature (you will relocate it using a sketch constraint later).
 
5. Select the Circle tool on the Sketch tab; then sketch a circle at the end of the rectangle 
starting with the midpoint of the vertical line on the right and snapping to the endpoint 
of the top or bottom line. You don’t need to trim the circle before converting this sketch 
into a feature, and in fact, unneeded trimming of sketch entities often works against you 
because it may remove sketch constraints.
 
6. Use the Dimension tool on the Sketch tab and add a dimension to the circle. Rather than 
just entering a value, enter Diameter = 40 mm, thereby assigning the dimension a name 
and a value (be sure you have named this dimension because you will be using it in the 
steps to come).
 
7. You’ll next create an equation for the length of the rectangle based on the length of the 
diameter value. With the Dimension tool, select the edge of the rectangle and enter Slot_
Length =.
 
8. Click the 40 mm diameter dimension you just created. This will link the two dimensions. 
Finish the equation with *5 so that your end equation reads Slot_Length = Diameter*5. 
Note that you must use an underscore here because spaces are not allowed in parameter 
names. Your sketch should look similar to Figure 4.56.
Figure 4.56
Creating and dimen-
sioning geometry in 
Sketch2

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 195
 
9. Create a Coincident constraint between the midpoint of the left vertical line of the rect-
angle and the midpoint of the left, projected, vertical line of the base feature.
 
10. Select one (or all) of the projected lines of the base feature and convert it to a construction 
line (this ensures that Inventor will not attempt to extrude the large projected profi le in 
the next step).
Use Work Features to Anchor Your Sketches
Another way to anchor this sketch to the midplane of the rectangle is by using work features. Before 
starting a sketch, click the Plane icon on the Work Features panel. Select one side of the rectangular 
feature and then the other. Th is will create a parametrically centered work plane.
Th en you can create a sketch, and in that sketch use the Project Geometry tool to project the edge 
of the work plane. Th is will project the work plane as a line onto the sketch plane. You can then 
use this line as a centerline in your sketch-creation sequence. If you were to ever change the size 
of the base feature, then the work plane, and the projected line, this sketch would all update and 
remain centered.
 
11. Finish the sketch and choose Extrude on the 3D Model tab.
 
12. If needed, use the ViewCube to view the part from an isometric view.
 
13. Select the rectangle and the circle you just created for the profi le.
 
14. Click the Cut button (the second button down in the list of operation buttons) so that 
the profi les will be cut out of the base feature. Your preview should be red when the Cut 
operation is selected. Check the direction arrow to ensure that the cut is going in the 
 correct direction.
 
15. In the Extents drop-down, select All. The All option extrudes the profi le through all the 
current features of the entire part in the specifi ed direction or in both directions if you 
chose the Midplane option. If the size of the base part features change, the cut extrusion 
feature will update accordingly. Click the OK button when your options look like 
Figure 4.57 and then save your fi le.
Figure 4.57

196 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Creating a Sketch-Based Hole Feature
Hole features are powerful components of Inventor. Many methods are available for creating 
holes. You can create holes in the following ways:
 
◆
By utilizing existing sketches containing sketch center points
 
◆
By distance from two planar edges
 
◆
On a face by referencing a concentric edge or concentric face
 
◆
By using a work point feature
You can continue with the fi le you are working on or open the fi le mi_4a_060.ipt. Follow 
these steps to create another sketch and then use that sketch to place a hole:
 
1. On the 3D Model tab, click the Start 2D Sketch button and then click the large front face 
of the part (or right-click the face and select New Sketch). Sketch3 is now created and 
active.
 
2. If needed, use the ViewCube to orient your view of the part so that you have a fl at 2D 
view of your sketch plane with the rectangle running horizontally on your screen.
 
3. You might see the outline of the sketch plane face automatically projected into your 
sketch (if not, click the Project Geometry button and select the sketch plane).
 
4. On the Sketch tab, select the Offset button on the Modify panel.
 
5. Before selecting anything to offset, right-click and ensure that both the Loop-Select and 
Constrain Offset options are selected.
Loop-Select  This option selects lines/curves joined at their endpoints. Deselect to select 
one or more lines/curves individually.
Constrain Offset  This option constrains the distance between the new geometry and 
the original to be equidistant.
 
6. Click the radius and then drag the offset profi le so that it is created to the inside of the 
part. Then right-click and click Cancel.
 
7. Place a dimension between the offset profi le and the outside edge of the part and enter 
Offset = 20 mm in the input box (again, be sure to name this, because you will be using it 
in the steps that follow).
 
8. Window-select the entire part/sketch so that all of the lines are selected; then click the 
Construction button and convert the lines to construction lines.

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 197
Select Objects with a Window Selection
You can create multiple entity selections using what is referred to as a window selection. Window 
selection sets include objects diﬀ erently depending on whether the window is created from left 
to right or right to left:
 
◆
Position the pointer slightly above and to the left of the leftmost entity to select and then click 
and drag the pointer slightly below and to the right of the rightmost entity you want to select. 
All objects that are fully enclosed within the rectangle are selected and highlighted.
 
◆
Position the pointer slightly below and to the right of the rightmost entity to select; then click 
and drag the pointer slightly above and to the left of the leftmost entity you want to select. All 
objects that are enclosed by and/or intersected by the rectangle are selected and highlighted.
You can use the Ctrl and Shift keys to add entities to and remove entitles from the selection sets.
 
9. Select the Point tool on the Draw panel of the Sketch tab and place a point on the corner 
of the offset loop, as shown in Figure 4.58.
Figure 4.58
Placing a sketch point 
for hole placement
 
10. Finish the sketch and choose the Hole tool on the 3D Model tab.
 
11. If needed, use the ViewCube to view the part from an isometric view.
 
12. The Hole tool should have automatically selected your sketch point; if not, make sure the 
Placement drop-down is set to From Sketch and the Centers button is selected and then 
select the sketch point on-screen.
 
13. In the Termination drop-down, select Through All to ensure that the hole depth always 
cuts through the part. Then set Type to Tapped, set the Threads options to ISO Metric 
Profi le, set Size to 10, and set Designation to M10x1.5 (as shown in Figure 4.59). Click the 
OK button and save your part.

198 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
Figure 4.59
Hole options
Selecting Sketched Hole Centers
Th e Hole tool will automatically select sketched center points as long as only one visible unconsumed 
sketch is available. If you ﬁ nd that the Hole tool is not picking up your center point automatically, 
check to see that you haven’t accidentally created an extra sketch in the model tree. You can hover 
your mouse pointer over the Sketch node in the browser to see the sketched entities highlight on 
the screen. If you determine that you have accidentally created an extra sketch, you can right-click 
it and click Delete.
Note, too, that only center points (small cross marks) are automatically selected by the Hole tool 
and simple points are not. However, you can manually select simple points for hole placement. You 
can also convert center points to simple points, or vice versa, by using the Center Point button on 
the Sketch tab (you’ll ﬁ nd it next to the Construction tool).
Creating a Rectangular Hole Pattern
So far, the features you’ve created have been based on a sketch. These types of features are, there-
fore, referred to as sketched features. Features not based on sketches are referred to as placed fea-
tures. Placed features are solely dependent on existing part geometry. In the pages to come you 
will explore the steps necessary to create a placed feature in the form of a rectangular pattern.
When creating patterns, you have the choice of creating them at the feature level or at the 
sketch level. For instance, you could have patterned the sketch point using a sketch pattern and 

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 199
then placed multiple holes at once using the Hole tool. It is generally best, though, to create pat-
terns as features rather than sketch patterns. Here are two reasons to consider feature patterns:
 
◆
A feature pattern saves time when creating spaced, multiple instances of a feature, and it 
makes editing the spacing easily accessible.
 
◆
Using a feature pattern in a part allows you to later use that pattern to create a component pat-
tern in an assembly and follow the original part pattern. For instance, if you placed this part 
into an assembly, you could pattern a bolt to occupy every hole within the pattern by simply 
constraining one bolt into the original hole feature and then use the Component Pattern tool 
to automatically pick up the hole pattern count and spacing. The Component Pattern tool is 
available only within the assembly environment.
First you’ll need to determine the pattern spacing. From the creation of the second feature, 
you know the round end of the slot has a width of 40 mm. From the creation of the placed 
hole, you know the offset from the slot edge is 20 mm. From this information, you can deter-
mine that the spacing of the two rows of holes is (2 × offset value) + 40 mm, therefore 80 mm. 
Assume the design specifi cation requires eight holes in each row and they need to be spaced 
at a distance of 25 mm apart. With this information, you are now ready to proceed with creat-
ing the hole  pattern. You can continue with the fi le from the previous section or open the fi le 
mi_4a_061.ipt. Then follow these steps:
 
1. On the 3D Model tab, click the Rectangular Pattern button on the Pattern panel.
 
2. In the Rectangular Pattern dialog box, you are being asked to select the features to 
 pattern. You can select the hole from the graphics area, but you may fi nd it easier to do so 
from the Model browser. No matter what method you use, check the Model browser to 
ensure that only Hole1 is highlighted (you can use Ctrl+click to deselect any accidentally 
selected features).
 
3. Click the arrow button under Direction 1 and select the edge of the slot cutout. Use a 
direction button to change the direction, if required, and set the count and spacing to 8 
and 25 mm, respectively. You can confi rm that your settings look similar to Figure 4.60.
Figure 4.60
List parameters in 
the Rectangular 
Pattern dialog box

200 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
4. Click the arrow button under Direction 2 and select one of the short ends of the part. Use 
a direction button to change the direction, if required, and set the count to 2.
Although you could just change the spacing value to 80 mm and complete the pattern, 
you might want to consider what would happen if the width of the slot feature were to 
change. If that were to happen, the hole pattern spacing would stay at 80 mm and no lon-
ger remain symmetric to the slot width. To avoid this, you will make the pattern spacing 
parametric by calling the dimensions of earlier features into your pattern spacing. In this 
way, you are building a formula right into the pattern so that if those dimensions change, 
the spacing setting will follow.
 
5. To do this, fi rst clear the Direction 2 length input box.
 
6. Click the arrow at the right of the length input box and click List Parameters from the 
fl yout shown in Figure 4.60.
 
7. Choose Diameter from the list; then choose List Parameters again and, fi nally, choose 
Offset.
 
8. Edit the input to read Diameter + 2* Offset.
 
9. If the text shows in red, there is an error. When you have a valid formula, it will display 
in black. Check the preview, ensure that the pattern looks correct, and then click the OK 
button. Confi rm that your part looks like Figure 4.61 and then you can save your fi le.
Figure 4.61

pattern
Editing Sketches and Features
You will often need to modify a sketch and/or feature after you have created it. Oftentimes you 
may fi nd that because designs are similar, it is most effi cient to copy an existing part and then 
make changes to the copy.
In the next steps, you’ll edit some of the features you’ve just created, but before doing so, 
it will be helpful to understand the behaviors associated with the model tree and browser 
nodes. When a feature is sketch-based, you can expand the plus sign next to it to reveal the 
sketch. Likewise, when a feature has multiple elements such as a pattern, you can expand it to 
view and control each element. If a feature is placed rather than sketch-based, it may not have 

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 201
any  elements and, therefore, will lack a plus sign. Figure 4.62 shows the anatomy of the three 
browser nodes.
Figure 4.62
Editing features and 
sketches
The extrusion is based on Sketch1, as you can see. However, the hole in Figure 4.62 is a placed 
feature based solely on the edges of other features and, therefore, contains no sketch (you’ll 
place a hole of this type in the pages to come). The pattern, when expanded, shows the features 
that it contains and each occurrence of those features.
Editing a Sketch
To edit a feature or a sketch, you can right-click it and choose Edit Feature or Edit Sketch, or you 
can double-click the Browser Node icon for that feature/sketch. Be sure to double-click the Node 
icon rather than the node text; otherwise, you set the text active for renaming. Follow these steps 
to explore the edit procedures of features and sketches:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, choose Open (or press Ctrl+O on the keyboard).
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_4a_062.ipt located in the Chapter 04 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. In the Model browser, right-click Extrusion2 and choose Edit Sketch. You’ll notice that the 
sketch becomes active for edits, and the part displays in a rolled-back stage as it existed 
when the sketch was originally created.
 
4. You want to edit the diameter dimension and change it to an inch-based value. To do so, 
double-click the dimension, type 2 in into the input box, and then press Enter.
You’ll notice that Inventor converts the value to a millimeter equivalent for you. You can 
mix units as required, but know that any value that does not have a unit is assumed to be 
the part’s base unit. This means if you were to enter 2 without the abbreviation for inch 
(in), the diameter would be set to 2 mm because this part is mm-based.
 
5. Click the Finish Sketch button on the Sketch tab (or right-click and click Finish 2D Edit) to 
return to the feature level of the part.

202 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
You’ll also notice that as a result of the sketch edit of the diameter, the length of the slot cut-
out adjusts automatically as well because it contains a formula to ensure that it is always fi ve 
times the diameter of the circle.
Editing a Feature
Note that the spacing for the rectangular pattern adjusted automatically on each side of the slot 
cutout but did not adjust for the length of the pattern. This is because the pattern contains a 
parametric formula that controls the width spacing but not the length. To fi x this, you’ll edit the 
rectangular pattern, as shown in these steps:
 
1. Double-click Rectangular Pattern1 in the browser to open the edit dialog box.
 
2. On the left side, clear the value of 25 mm, click the arrow button, choose List Parameters 
from the fl yout, and select Slot_Length from the list.
 
3. The spacing is now adjusted so that the holes are patterned at the Slot_Length value. 
Looking at the preview, obviously this is not correct. To fi x this, click the drop-down at 
the bottom left and change it from Spacing to Distance. Click the OK button to accept 
these changes.
You might decide that the rectangular pattern needs to include features that were not 
originally present when the pattern was created, such as Extrusion3 and Chamfer1 found 
in this part. If you edit the pattern, you’ll notice that the part rolls back to the state that it 
existed in at the time the pattern was created; therefore, you cannot add the new features 
to the pattern. To resolve this, you will reorder the features and then edit the pattern.
 
4. In the Model browser, select Extrusion3 and Chamfer1 and drag them above the rectan-
gular pattern.
You can reorder features in this way so long as they are not dependent on one another. 
For instance, if you attempt to drag Chamfer1 above Extrusion3, you’ll fi nd that it can’t be 
done. This is because the chamfer is based on the geometry of the extrusion.
 
5. Once the features have been reordered, double-click the rectangular pattern to edit it or 
right-click and choose Edit Feature.
 
6. Ensure that the Features button is selected and select Extrusion3 and Chamfer1 from the 
Model browser so that they are added to the pattern. Your preview should update as well. 
Click the OK button to accept these changes.
You may decide that although the pattern provides the correct spacing of the elements, 
you need to exclude some of the middle instances to accommodate other features. You 
can do this easily by suppressing the instances you do not need and still maintaining the 
constant pattern spacing.

PART MODELING EXERCISE | 203
 
7. Expand the rectangular pattern feature in the browser, and note that all the instances of 
the patterned features are listed as occurrences.
 
8. Roll your mouse pointer down over the list, and you will see the instances highlight on-
screen, each indicating which occurrence it is.
 
9. Identify the fourth and fi fth instances on each side of the pattern, right-click them, and 
choose Suppress. You can do this one at a time or hold Ctrl as you select them and sup-
press them all at once. Notice that these occurrences are no longer present on the part 
and are marked with strikethrough in the browser. Figure 4.63 shows the results of these 
edits. You can close the part without saving changes.
Figure 4.63
Th e edited part
Repairing Features and Sketches
Ordinarily, you want to create chamfer and fi llet features at the end of the overall part-creation 
process. Creating chamfers and fi llets at the end of the process reduces errors caused by feature 
dependencies associated with these features. In the following exercise, however, you will create 
a chamfer before creating a hole and then make a change to illustrate both the folly of creating 
placed features too early in the design and the method of repairing a feature error:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, choose Open (or press Ctrl+O on the keyboard).
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_4a_063.ipt located in the Chapter 04 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. Select the Chamfer tool (look under the Fillet fl yout menu) on the 3D Model tab and select 
the corner indicated with the red arrow.
 
4. Set the distance to 30 mm and click the OK button.
 
5. Click the Start 2D Sketch button and create a sketch on the yellow face.

204 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
6. Use the Point tool to place a point near the chamfered corner, dimension it as shown in 
Figure 4.64, and then click Finish Sketch.
Figure 4.64
Dimensions from the 
chamfered corner
 
7. Select the Hole tool on the 3D Model tab and place a counterbore hole as shown in 
Figure 4.64.
 
8. At this point you decide that the chamfered corner will not work with this design and 
should have been a rounded corner. To make this change, right-click the chamfer feature 
in the Model browser and choose Delete from the menu.
 
9. Because the counterbore hole is dependent on the chamfer, you are prompted with the 
option to keep it or let it be deleted also. You will choose to keep it by deselecting the 
Dependent Sketches And Features box and clicking OK.
 
10. Notice the hole feature in the browser now has a marker symbol next to it indicating it is 
“sick” and is in need of some repair. Expand the Hole2 feature node, and you will see that 
the sketch is also marked as “sick.” Right-click the sketch and choose Recover, as shown 
in Figure 4.65.
Figure 4.65
Selecting Recover to 
examine sketches 
with errors in them
 
11. In the Sketch Doctor dialog box, you will see a list of the issues present in the problematic 
sketch. Click Next to see the recommendations for resolving this problem. The recom-
mendation is to edit the sketch.
 
12. Click Next again, and you will see that there is only one treatment option in this case.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 205
 
13. Click Finish and then click the OK button in the message box informing you that you are 
being taken to the sketch environment.
Depending on the extent of the error, the Sketch Doctor may offer you the ability to delete 
objects, close open loops, and so on. Of course, you could have just edited the sketch 
originally and ended up with the same result in this case. But in cases where you do not 
know the extent of the problems, the Recover option is often helpful in determining the 
issue.
 
14. In the sketch, you will see the unresolved sketch entities highlighted in magenta. Right-
click the magenta line and choose Break Link. This breaks the link with the missing 
chamfer edge but does not fully fi x the problem.
 
15. Select the magenta endpoint(s) and use the context menu’s Break Link option on it/them 
as well. This results in the diagonal line being underconstrained. You have two choices to 
resolve this:
 
◆
Use the Coincident constraint along with the General Dimension tool to lock down 
the diagonal line.
 
◆
Delete the diagonal line and its referencing dimensions and redimension the hole 
center point off the edges of the base part.
 
16. Once you have reconstrained the hole center by one of these methods, click Finish Sketch 
and return to the feature level of the part. Notice that the hole and sketch are no longer 
“sick.”
 
17. Choose Fillet on the 3D Model tab and select the same edge previously used by the cham-
fer to place a 30 mm fi llet. Once you have fi nished, you can close the fi le without saving 
changes.
Although there is probably no way you will ever completely avoid having to repair features 
and sketches, using placed features such as chamfers and fi llets as late in the design as possible 
will go a long way toward reducing these issues. You should also strive to avoid referencing 
these features with dimensions when they are present.
Th e Bottom Line
Confi gure options and settings for part modeling.  Understanding the settings and 
options that apply to the modeling environment is essential for getting the results you want 
from Inventor.
Master It  You want to confi gure your options and settings for your sketch environment 
and then back them up and/or distribute them to other workstations. How would you go 
about doing this?
Create basic part features.  In this chapter, you learned how to plan a workfl ow that allows 
you to create stable, editable parts that preserve the design intent.
Master It  You need to create a fairly complex part consisting of many extrusions, re-
volves, sweeps, and lofts. In addition, you will need to create holes, fi llets, chamfers, and 

206 | CHAPTER 4 BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES
other part modifi ers. This part may need signifi cant modifi cation in the future by you or 
by other designers. What considerations will guide your part creation?
Use the Extrude tool.  The Extrude tool is one of the most commonly used feature tools in the 
Inventor modeling toolset. Understanding the options and solutions available in this tool will 
prove useful throughout your designs.
Master It  Imagine that you need to create an extruded feature but don’t know the exact 
length; instead, you know the extrude will always terminate based on another feature. 
However, the location of that feature has not been fully determined just yet. How do you 
get started on the feature?
Create revolved parts and thread features.  Creating revolved features and parts in 
Inventor can often resemble the creation of turned parts and features in the real world. 
Applying thread features to a cylindrical face allows you to specify threads without having 
to actually model them.
Master It  Let’s say you have a part that you intend to fabricate on a lathe. Although you 
could create the part with a series of stepped circular extrusions, it occurs to you that the 
Revolve tool might work also. How do you decide which method to use?
Create work features.  Using work features, work planes, work axes, and work points 
enable you to create virtually any part or feature. Work features are the building blocks for 
sketch creation and use.
Master It  Your design will require creating features on spherical and cylindrical faces. 
You need to precisely control the location and angle of these features. How do you do 
that?
Use the Fillet tool.  The Fillet tool has a great deal of functionality packed into it. Taking 
the time to explore all the options on a simple test model may be the best way to understand 
them all.
Master It  You are trying to create a series of fi llets on a part. You create four sets of edge 
selections to have four different fi llet sizes, but when you attempt to apply them, you re-
ceive an error stating that the feature cannot be built. What went wrong?
Create intelligent hole features.  Although you can create a hole in a part by sketching a 
circle and extrude-cutting it, this is typically not the recommended approach.
Master It  You need to create a part with a series of various-sized holes on a plate. You 
would like to lay out the hole pattern in a single sketch and then use the Hole tool to cut 
the holes to the sizes required. However, when you select the From Sketch option in the 
Hole tool, it selects all of the holes, so you think you must need to sketch out the hole 
pattern as circles and then use the Extrude tool to cut them out. Is this really the way to 
proceed?
Bend parts.  You can bend a portion of a part after you defi ne a bend line using a 2D sketch 
line. You can specify the side of the part to bend; the direction of the bend; and its angle, 
radius, or arc length.
Master It  You need to create a model of a piece of rolled tube and would like to specify 
the bend direction, but when you use the direction arrow, you get a preview in only one 
direction. How can you get a preview in either direction ?

Chapter 5
Advanced Modeling Techniques
Chapter 4, “Basic Modeling Techniques,” introduced some of the primary modeling tools you 
need when creating a 3D parametric part. Modern parametric modeling utilizes numerous tools 
to create stable, editable parts. The basic workfl ow of creating a part is to create a base feature and 
then build upon that base. The tools used to build the additional features can vary depending on 
your need and may range from simple extruded features to complex combinations of different 
feature types.
In this chapter, you will explore some of the more complex and curvy modeling techniques 
used to create models with the Autodesk® Inventor® and Autodesk® Inventor LT™ programs. 
Some of these features involve creating a base profi le sketch along with support sketches used 
for defi ning paths and shape contours. Such features are based on the same rules used to cre-
ate simpler features, such as extrudes and revolves, but they take it to the next level by using 
multiple sketches to defi ne the feature. Other advanced features covered in this chapter depart 
from these concepts and move into the new territory of feature creation. In either case, having a 
strong understanding of sketch-creation and editing principles is assumed and recommended.
All the skills in this chapter are primarily based on creating a single part, whether in a part 
fi le or in the context of an assembly fi le.

Creating Complex Sweeps and Lofts
Now that you have moved on from creating simple features, you can explore the use of sweeps 
and lofts to create features with a bit more complexity. Both sweeps and lofts require one or 
more profi les to create a fl owing shape. Sweeps require one sketch profi le and a second sketched 
sweep path to create 3D geometry. Lofts typically require two or more sketch profi les and 
optional rails and/or points that assist in controlling the fi nal geometry.
Creating and Using Sweeps
You can think of a sweep feature as an extrusion that follows a path defi ned by another 
sketch. 2D or 3D sketch paths can be used to create the sweep feature. Like most Inventor

geometry, a sweep can be created as either a solid or a surface. Sweeps can add or remove 
material from a part, or you can use the Intersect option like you can with the Extrusion tool. 
If your intent is to create multi-body parts, you can choose the New Solids option also.
Creating D Paths
When creating a sweep feature, you will typically want to fi rst create the path sketch and then 
create a profi le sketch that will contain the geometry to be swept along the path. To create the 
profi le sketch, you will need to create a work plane at the end of your path. This plane will be 
referenced to create a new sketch. It’s not mandatory that you create the path and then the pro-
fi le, but it is easier to defi ne the profi le sketch plane (that is, a work plane) by doing it this way. 
Normally, this geometry will be perpendicular to one end of the sweep path.
A basic rule of sweep features is that the volume occupied by the sweep profi le may not 
intersect itself within the feature. Some self-intersecting features are currently supported, but 
many will fail. An example of a self-intersecting feature is a sweep path composed of straight-
line segments with tight radius arcs between the segments. Assuming that the sweep profi le is 
circular with a radius value larger than the smallest arc within the sweep path, the feature will 
self-intersect and the operation will fail. For a sweep to work, the minimum path radius must be 
larger than the profi le radius. In the 2D sketch path example shown in Figure 5.1, the path radius 
is set at 12 mm. Knowing that the minimum path radius value is 12 mm, you can determine that 
the sketch profi le radius must be less than or equal to this value.
Figure 5.1
2D sketch path
Creating the Sweep Profile
Once a sketch path has been created, you can create a work plane on the path and then sketch 
the profi le on that plane. To see this process in action, follow these steps, starting with the cre-
ation of the path:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the New button.
 
2. On the Metric node of the New File dialog box, select the Standard(mm).ipt template.
 
3. Create a 2D sketch as shown in Figure 5.1.
 
4. Once you’ve created the sketch path, right-click and choose Finish 2D Sketch; then click 
the Plane button on the 3D Model tab to create a work plane.
 
5. Select the endpoint of the 2D sketch path and then the path itself to create the plane. 
This creates a plane on the point normal to the selected line. Figure 5.2 shows the created 
work plane.

Figure 5.2

plane on which to 
sketch
 
6. Once you’ve created the work plane, right-click the edge of it and select New Sketch.
 
7. In the new sketch, use the Project Geometry tool to project the 230 mm line into this new 
sketch. It should come in as a projected point.
 
8. Create a circle anchored to the projected point, give it a value of 20 mm in diameter, and 
then click the Finish Sketch button.
 
9. Select the Sweep tool. If you have a single sweep profi le, it should automatically select the 
profi le and pause for you to select a path.
 
10. Select a line in the path sketch to set it as the path.
Note that you can select either Solid or Surface for the feature. The sweep type will 
default to Path, and the orientation will default to Path as well. The Sweep tool also has 
an option to taper the sweep feature, as shown in Figure 5.3.
Figure 5.3
Sweep dialog box 
options
A number less than zero for the taper will diminish the cross section as the profi le fol-
lows the path. A positive number will increase the cross section. If the taper increases the 
cross section at the radius of the path to a value that exceeds the radius value, the feature 
will fail because this will create a self-intersecting path.
 
11. Adjust the taper to a negative value to see the preview update. Note that if you enter a 
positive value that’s 0.5 or more, the preview will fail, indicating a self-intersecting path. 
Set the taper back to 0, and click the OK button to create the sweep.

210 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
You’ll notice that this sweep feature consumes both sketches in the browser, just as an 
extruded feature consumes the sketch it is created from. To edit the sweep, you can expand 
the browser node by clicking the plus sign and access both the profi le and path sketches to 
make edits. You can also right-click the sweep feature node and choose Edit Feature to change 
the options in the Sweep dialog. Explore the ways to edit the sweep you just created, and then 
you can close the fi le without saving changes. In the next section you will look at more sweep 
options.
Exploring Sweep Options
Although sweeping along a path is the default option, you can also utilize the Path & Guide Rail 
or Path & Guide Surface option to control the output of the Sweep tool. These options provide 
additional control for more complex results. Often these options are utilized on sweeps based on 
a 3D sketch path, but this is not required. You can create a 3D sketch path by using the Include 
Geometry tool, or you can just use the existing geometry edges where valid selections exist.
Path & Guide Rail Option
The Path & Guide Rail option provides a means to control the orientation of a profi le as it is 
swept along a path. In Figure 5.4, the rectangular sweep profi le will be swept along the straight 
path but controlled by the 3D helical rail. This approach is useful for creating twisted or helical 
parts.
Figure 5.4
Sweep proﬁ le, Path 
& Guide Rail option
The 3D helical rail is guiding the rotation of the profi le even though the sweep profi le is 
fully constrained with horizontal and vertical constraints. Creating this part starts with creat-
ing the sweep path as the fi rst sketch followed by creating a second sketch perpendicular to the 
start point of the sweep path. The 3D helical rail is created using the Helical Curve tool in a 3D 
sketch. Follow these steps:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_5a_004.ipt from the Chapter 05 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder. If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 5 fi les from www
.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” sec-
tion of the introduction for the download and setup instructions.

and the helix as the guide rail, and then click the OK button. Your result should resemble 
Figure 5.5.

without saving changes and take a look at the use of the Twist option in the next section.
Path & Twist Option
In this exercise, you’ll use the Twist option to provide the helical twisting of the sweep feature:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_5a_005.ipt from the Chapter 05 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder. 
 
2. Click the Sweep button on the 3D Model tab. Note that because there is only one pro-
fi le and one path, the Sweep tool automatically selects them for the Profi le and Path 
selections.
 
3. Enter 90 in the Twist input box and note the preview.
 
4. Change the Twist input to 360 in the Twist input box and note the new preview.
 
5. Next, change the Twist input to -360 and again note how the preview changes.
 
6. Lastly, change the Twist input to -360*3 and again take note of the change to the preview.
 
7. Click the OK button to create the twisted sweep.
Using the twist option, you’re able to quickly create twisted, swept features without the use 
of a guide rail sketch. Feel free to experiment with the twist option using this fi le, and then 
you can close it without saving changes and take a look at the use of a guide surface in the next 
section.

4. Right-click ExtrusionSrf1 in the browser and select Visibility to turn it off.
 
5. Click the Plane button on the 3D Model tab, click and hold down on the yellow surface, 
and then drag up to create an offset work plane at 85 mm.
 
6. Right-click the edge of the work plane and choose New Sketch.
 
7. Using the Project Geometry tool, select the wavy face. This will result in a projected rect-
angle in your sketch.
 
8. Create a circle with the center point at the midpoint of the projected rectangle and the 
tangent point on the corner of the rectangle so that your results look like the image on 
the left of Figure 5.7. Click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch.

form. You can close this fi le without saving changes and move on to the next section to explore 
lofted features.
Sweep along an Edge
It’s often useful to sweep a profi le along an existing edge or edges in order to create a complex 
sweep shape. In the past you might have been required to create a 3D sketch beforehand and 
use the Include Geometry option. But you can now just use the edges for the sweep path, and 
Inventor will create the 3D sketch and included geometry for you, as demonstrated in the fol-
lowing steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; open the fi le mi_5a_007.ipt from your Chapter 05 
folder.
 
2. Click the Sweep button on the 3D Model tab.
 
3. The profi le should be selected automatically since there is just one sketch to use. Select 
the outer edge of the part for the sweep path.
 
4. Click the OK button to create the sketch.
 
5. Expand the sweep feature in the browser and notice the presence of the automatically 
created 3D sketch.
As you can see, setting up a part fi le to use the edges for a sweep path can provide a quick 
and powerful way to create otherwise diffi cult features. You can close this fi le without saving 
changes and continue on to explore loft features.
Creating Loft Features
Whereas a sweep allows the creation of single profi le extruded along a path, loft features allow 
the creation of multiple cross-sectional profi les that are used to create a lofted shape. The Loft tool 
requires two or more profi le sections to function. Rails and control points are additional options 
that help control the shape of a loft feature. A good example of a lofted shape is a boat hull.
Loft with Rails
You could create a boat hull by defi ning just the section profi les, but you can gain more control 
over the end result by creating a loft with rails. Figure 5.10 shows the completed wireframe geom-
etry to create a section of a boat hull. The geometry includes four section sketches, each composed 
of a 2D spline sketched onto a work plane. There are two rails: the top and bottom composed of 3D 
sketch splines.
Follow these steps to explore the creation of a loft feature with the use of rails:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; open the fi le mi_5a_008.ipt found in your Chapter 
05 folder.
 
2. Select the Loft tool from the 3D Model tab (note that you might need to click the fl yout 
arrow under the Sweep button to fi nd the Loft button).
 
3. Since the four section sketches are open profi les, the Loft tool will automatically set the 
output to Surface. Select the four cross-section sketches in consecutive order, front to back 
or back to front.

2. Select the hull surface for the Features selection and then click the Mirror Plane button.
 
3. Expand the Origin folder in the browser, click YZ to use it as the mirror plane, and click

4. Next, you will create a 3D sketch to create a line for the top edge of the transom (back of 
the boat); right-click in the graphics window and choose New 3D Sketch.

216 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
5. On the 3D Sketch tab, click the Line tool and draw a line across the back of the boat 
to form the top of the transom. Draw another line across the bottom of the transom 
where the two sides do not quite meet. Figure 5.12 shows the back of the boat with the 
3D sketch lines.

Turning Off the Translucency of Surfaces and Shadows to See Better
If you have diﬃ  culty seeing the endpoints when attempting to draw the 3D Sketch line, you can 
expand the mirror feature in the browser, locate the loft surfaces, and then right-click and deselect 
Translucent.
It might also help to go to the View tab and deselect all of the shadows options.
 
7. Select the Patch button on the Surface panel of the 3D Model tab to bring up the Boundary 
Patch tool and ensure the Automatic Edge Chain option is not selected. Then select your 
3D sketch lines and the back curved edges to create a surface for the transom. When 
creating boundaries, you need to select the lines in the order in which they occur in the 
boundary. Click the Apply button and then create another boundary patch across the top 
by selecting the two edges of the sides and the top edge of the transom. Figure 5.13 shows 
the selections.

9. Select the Stitch tool on the Surface panel and select all fi ve of the surfaces you created. 
It’s easiest to window-select them all at once.
 
10. Click the Apply button and then the Done button.
Using the Shell Tool
You should now have a solid boat. If you didn’t complete the previous exercise, you can open the 
fi le mi_5a_009.ipt to explore the Shell tool. If you’re continuing with the boat you created from 
the loft exercise, be sure to save your fi le. This is just good practice before running calculation-
intensive operations like the Shell tool, particularly on free-form shapes like this boat hull. Once 
you’ve saved your fi le or opened the one provided, follow these steps to explore the Shell tool:
 
1. Once your fi le has been saved, select the Shell tool on the Modify panel of the 
3D Model tab.
 
2. Click the top face for the Remove Faces selection and set Thickness to 10 mm.
If your system is a bit undersized, you might want to skip the next two steps and click 
the OK button now to let the shell solve for just one thickness. Otherwise, you’ll specify a 
unique thickness for the transom.
 
3. Click the >> button to reveal the Unique Face Thickness settings, click the Click To Add 
row, and then click the transom face.
 
4. Set the unique face thickness value to 30 mm and click the OK button to build the shell.

areas of the design that need improvement. But, for now, you can close the fi le without saving 
changes and move on to explore the area loft options in the next section.
Area Loft
Area loft is used in the design of components where the fl ow of a gas or liquid must be precisely 
controlled. Area loft is a different way of controlling the fi ner points of creating a loft shape. 
Figure 5.15 illustrates what might be considered a fairly typical loft setup, consisting of three 
section profi les and a centerline. The goal here is to create a loft from these profi les and to create 
a fourth profi le to control the airfl ow through the resulting part cavity so that it can be choked 
down or opened up as needed.

Area loft proﬁ les
Follow these steps to explore the creation of an area loft:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; open the fi le mi_5a_010.ipt from your Chapter 05

2. Start the Loft tool and select the three sections in order, starting with the small rectangu-
lar shape.
 
3. Right-click, choose Select Center Line, and then click the centerline sketch line running 
down the middle of the profi le sketches.
 
4. Right-click again, and choose Placed Sections; notice as you choose an option from the 
context menu that the dialog box updates to refl ect your selections. You could have just as 
easily used the dialog box controls to do this, but oftentimes it is easier not to create the 
extra mouse travel.

Once you click a location, the Section Dimensions dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 5.16, giving you control over the position and section area of the placed section. 
You can switch the position input from Proportional Distance, where you enter a percent-
age of the centerline length, to Absolute, which allows you to enter an actual distance if 
you know it.

In the Section Size area, you specify the actual area or set a scale factor based on the area 
of the loft as calculated from the sections before and after the one you are creating. On 
the far left, you can switch the section from driving to driven, letting the area be calcu-
lated from the position. Any number of placed sections can be used to create precise 
control of the feature.
 
6. Leave Section Position set to Proportional Distance, change the position to 0.75, set the 
area to 800 (as shown in Figure 5.16), and click the OK button. You can access the section 
again by double-clicking the leader information.
 
7. Double-click the End section leader text and change it from Driven to Driving using the 
radio buttons on the left. Notice that you can set the area but not the position.

You may have noticed that by changing the end section to an area of 800 square millimeters, 
you altered the size of the end profi le from the original shape, in this case slightly reducing the 
diameter of the circle. Keep this in mind as you create area lofts, and you can use the original 
sketch to just rough in the shape and not worry as much about getting the size exactly right 
until you refi ne the area loft profi le. Of course, as always, you should still fully constrain the 
sketch profi le. You can close this fi le without saving changes and take a look at the centerline 
loft options in the next section.
Centerline Loft Feature
The centerline loft feature allows you to determine a centerline for the loft profi le to follow, just 
as you did with the area loft. In the following steps, you’ll create a wing feature using the center-
line loft and look at some of the condition options available in lofted features as well:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; open the fi le mi_5a_012.ipt from your Chapter 05 
folder.
 
2. Click the Loft button and select the yellow face of the wing stub feature and the sketch 
point at the end of the arc as sections.
 
3. Right-click, choose Select Center Line, and then click the arc. Notice how the lofted shape 
now holds the centerline, as shown in Figure 5.18.

4. Click the Conditions tab in the Loft dialog box so you can control the curve weight and 
transition type at the work point and wing stub profi le.

to 0.5 to adjust the blend from the wing stub feature.
 
6. Click the small drop-down to set Point Sketch2 to Tangent and then set the weight to 1.5.
 
7. Currently, the loft is extending out past the work plane. Often, this can be a problem 
because the work plane may have been established for the overall length of the part. To 
resolve this, set the drop-down to Tangent To Plane, and select the work plane on the 
screen. Notice the adjustment. Figure 5.19 shows the preview of the adjustments before 
and after the tangent plane is selected.

Here is the full list of conditions available, depending on the geometry type:
Free Condition  No boundary conditions exist for the object.
Tangent Condition  This condition is available when the section or rail is selected and is 
adjacent to a lateral surface, body, or face loop.
Smooth (G2) Condition  This option is available when the section or rail is adjacent to a lat-
eral surface or body or when a face loop is selected. G2 continuity allows for curve continuity 
with an adjacent previously created surface.
Direction Condition  This option is available only when the curve is a 2D sketch. The angle 
direction is relative to the selected section plane.
Sharp Point  This option is available when the beginning or end section is a work point.
Tangent  This option is available when the beginning or end section is a work point. 
Tangency is applied to create a rounded or dome-shaped end on the loft.
Tangent To Plane  This option is available on a point object, allowing the transition to a 
rounded dome shape. The planar face must be selected. This option is not available on center-
line lofts. 
The angle and weight options on the Conditions tab allow for changes to the angle of lofting 
and the weight value for an end condition transition. In this example, if the endpoint condi-
tion is changed to Tangent on the work point, the weight is automatically set to 1 and can be 
adjusted. Click the weight, and change it to 3 to see how the end condition will change in the 
preview. Experiment with the weight to see the changed conditions. If a value is grayed out, the 
condition at that point will not allow a change. Keep in mind that adding more intermediate 
profi les to the loft is often the best way to control and defi ne a specifi c loft shape.

Creating a Part Using Loft and Sculpt
It is often useful to create lofted surfaces when curved corners of differing radii are present. 
In the next exercise you’ll use the Loft tool to create the gently sloping edges of a tablet device 
housing. Then you’ll use the Mirror tool to duplicate the surface, and fi nally you’ll use the 
Sculpt tool to convert the enclosed surface into a solid.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open and open the fi le mi_5a_015.ipt from your Chapter 
05 folder.
 
2. Click the Loft button and set the output to be a surface using the Output button.
 
3. Select sections End Profi le1 and End Profi le2 from the browser.
 
4. Right-click and choose Select Rails; then select the 3D sketches named Top Rail and 
Bottom Rail from the browser.
Figure 5.20 shows the Loft dialog box and model preview with the selections made.
Figure 5.20

face loft
Selecting the sketches from the browser isn’t required, but it does eliminate the chance 
you might accidentally select an edge rather than the sketch if you try to select them 
on-screen.
 
5. Click the OK button to create the lofted surface.
 
6. Use the Stitch tool (on the Surface panel of the 3D Model tab) to stitch the lofted surface 
you just created and Boundary Patch1 together.
 
7. Use the Mirror tool (on the Pattern panel of the 3D Model tab) to mirror the stitched sur-
face, Extrusion1, Split1, and Fillet1. Use the YZ plane found in the Origin folder as the 
mirror plane selection.
 
8. Use the Mirror tool again, and this time select the mirror feature you just created as the 
feature to mirror and use the XZ plane found in the Origin folder as the mirror plane 
selection.
 
9. On the Surface panel, click the fl yout arrow next to the Patch button to fi nd the Sculpt 
button and then use the Sculpt tool and select all four quadrants of the surfaces as the 
surfaces selection. Your result should look like Figure 5.21.

Creating Multi-body Parts 
It is possible to create a multi-body part fi le with separate solids representing each part of an 
assembly and then save the solids as individual parts, even having them automatically placed 
into an assembly. Creating multiple solid bodies in a single-part fi le offers some unique advan-
tages compared to the traditional methods of creating parts in the context of an assembly fi le. 
For starters, you have one fi le location where all your design data is located. Second, it is often 
easier to fi t parts together using this method by simply sketching one part right on top of the 
other, and so on.
These two advantages are also the main two disadvantages. Placing large amounts of data 
(and time and effort) into a single fi le can be risky should that fi le be lost. And creating a part 
with an overabundance of interrelated sketches, features, and solid bodies can create a “house 
of cards” situation that makes changing an early sketch, feature, or solid a risky endeavor. Used 
wisely, though, multi-body parts are a powerful way to create tooling sets, molds, dies, and 
other interrelated parts.
If you do large-machine design, you would be wise to create many smaller, multi-body part 
fi les rather than attempting to build one large one. Or you might fi nd that using multi-body 
parts will work well for certain interrelated components whereas using traditional part/assem-
bly techniques works for the rest of the design.
Creating Multiple Solids
In the following steps, you’ll explore the creation of multi-body parts by building a simple trig-
ger mechanism. The challenge here is to defi ne the pawl feature on the trigger lever as it relates 
to the hammer bar. Figure 5.22 shows the trigger mechanism in its set position on the left and at 
rest on the right.
As the trigger lever is engaged, the hammer bar overcomes the pawl (lip), and the spring is 
allowed to force the hammer bar to swing. In the following steps, you’ll explore the multi-body 
solid options as you use one solid to determine the precise fi t with the other:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; open the part named mi_5a_016.ipt from your 
Chapter 05 folder.
 
2. Create a sketch on the front face of the plate.

4. Extrude the rectangle 3 mm away from the plate and use the New Solid option in the 
Extrude dialog box (leave the circle unselected from your extrude profi le so that you end 
up with a hole).
 
5. When you click the OK button, you’ll see that the Solid Bodies folder in the model tree 
now shows two bodies present, one representing the base plate and another representing 
the hammer bar.

CREATING MULTIBODY PARTS  | 225
 
6. Create another sketch on the front of the plate and create another rectangle toward the 
bottom, referencing the end of the hammer bar as shown in Figure 5.24.
Figure 5.24
Th e trigger-lever

7. Extrude the rectangle 3 mm away from the plate, use the New Solid option in the Extrude 
dialog box, and then click the OK button. This completes the base feature for the trigger 
lever.
 
8. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser and notice that there are three solids 
listed (if you see fewer than three, edit your extrusions and make sure you used the New 
Solid option).
 
9. Double-click the text that is your hammer bar and rename it Hammer Bar, for reference 
later.
 
10. Right-click the solid that is your trigger lever and choose Properties. In the resulting 
dialog box, set the name to Trigger Lever and change the color to blue; then click the OK 
button.
Here are several things to note at this point:
 
◆
If you expand the browser node for each solid listed in the Solid Bodies folder, you can 
see the features involved in each.
 
◆
You can right-click a solid or solids, choose Hide Others to isolate just the selected ones, 
and then use Show All to bring back any hidden solids.
 
◆
You can select the solid and then choose a color style from the Color Override drop-down 
on the Quick Access bar (at the very top of your screen).
 
◆
You can right-click each solid and choose Properties to set the name and color, view the 
mass properties, and strip previously overridden values. For instance, if you set just the 
front face of one of the solids to be red and then decided you wanted the entire solid to be 
blue, you could use the Strip Overrides option to remove the red face and set the solid to 
blue. If you did not use the Strip Overrides option, the red face would remain red, and the 
other faces would become blue.
Using One Solid to Shape Another
Next, you’ll create the pawl notch in the trigger lever. To do so, however, you will fi rst make a 
copy of the hammer bar and then turn that solid into a combined solid that represents the ham-
mer bar in both the set and resting positions. After that, you’ll cut that solid away from

the trigger lever. You can continue with the fi le from the previous steps or open the part named 
mi_5a_017.ipt from your Chapter 05 folder. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Use the ViewCube® to change the view so that you can see the cylindrical face of the hole 
in the hammer bar and then choose the Circular Pattern tool on the Patterns panel.
 
2. Select the Pattern A Solid button and click the hammer bar for the Solid selection.
 
3. Click the edge or face of the top hole for the rotation axis and set the placement count and 
angle to 2 and 15 degrees, respectively.
 
4. Use the button at the top-right corner of the dialog box to set the output to Create New 
Solid Bodies (the rightmost button), as shown in Figure 5.25.
Figure 5.25

tern to create a 
new solid
 
5. Ensure that the rotation direction is counterclockwise; use the Flip button if it is not and 
then click the OK button.
If you expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, you will see that there are now 
four solids, the last being the patterned copy of the hammer bar. You will now turn the 
visibility of the original hammer bar off and use the copy to cut a pawl notch in the trig-
ger plate.
 
6. Right-click the solid named Hammer Bar in the Solid Bodies folder and choose 
Visibility to hide that solid.
 
7. Select the Circular Pattern tool again and choose the Pattern A Solid option, as you did 
previously.
 
8. Click the edge or face of the top hole for the rotation axis and set the placement count and 
angle to 2 and 15 degrees, respectively.
 
9. Set the rotation direction to go clockwise using the fl ip button. This should place the pat-
terned copy in place of the original hammer bar.
 
10. This time use the buttons at the top-right corner of the dialog box to set the output to Join 
and then click the OK button. This will merge the selected solid with the new patterned 
one. Figure 5.26 shows the selections.

11. Select the Combine tool on the Modify panel and select the blue trigger lever for the Base 
selection.
 
12. Select the fused, rotated body for the Toolbody selection and then set the operation type 
to Cut so that you are subtracting it from the trigger lever. Then click the OK button.
 
13. Select any solid in the Solid Bodies folder and choose Show All to turn the visibility of 
all solids back on.
Now that you’ve solved the trigger-pawl shape and size by using a multi-body part, you 
could fi nish the parts by adding features to each body. You’ll note that if you create an extru-
sion, for instance, you can select which solid to add that extrusion to. If it is a cut extrusion, you 
can select multiple bodies and cut them all at once. The same is true of fi llets, holes, and so on.
Move and Rotate Solid Bodies
You can also use the Move Bodies tool to reposition solids once they are created. Try it on your 
trigger-mechanism parts. Note that to free-drag a solid you have to click the edges or outlines of 
the preview object rather than on the original object as you might suppose. You can also create 
a rotation using the Move Bodies tools, or you can move and rotate a body at the same time by 
creating a two-line action in the Move Bodies dialog box. To locate the Move Bodies tool click 
the Modify panel fl yout arrow. Figure 5.27 shows the Move Bodies options.

The options are as follows:
Free Drag  Move via X, Y, or Z Offsets or, better yet, just click the preview and drag it.
Move Along Ray  Select an edge or axis to defi ne the move direction and then specify an 
offset value or just click and drag it in that direction.
Rotate  Select an edge or axis to defi ne the rotational pivot and then specify an angle or 
click and drag it.
Click To Add  Create as many move actions as you want and do them all at once.
Split Solids
Another tool that you may fi nd useful when working with multi-body parts is the Split tool. For 
instance, if you create a simple solid block by sketching a rectangle on the XY plane and then 
extruding it 40 mm in both directions, you could then use the XY plane as a parting line to split 
the solid into two separate solids. You could also create a sketched curve, extrude it as a surface, 
and use it to split the solid.
Make Part and Make Components
Once you have created your multi-body part, you can write out each solid as an individual part 
fi le. The resulting part fi les are known as derived parts. You can think of these derived parts as 
just linked copies of the solid bodies. If you make a change in the multi-body part, it will update 
the derived part. You can break the link or suppress the link in the derived part as well. Using 
the Make Part and Make Components tools allows you to detail each solid body individually in 
separate drawings. If you attempt to detail the multi-body part in the drawing, you will see all 
the solids at once. There is no control to turn off individual solid bodies in a drawing view.
Additionally, you can choose to take your multi-body part and write the whole thing to an 
assembly. The assembly will consist of all the derived parts placed just as they exist in the multi-
body part. These fi les will be grounded in place automatically so that no Assembly constraints 
are required to hold them in place. If you decide you would like to apply constraints to all or 
some of the parts, you can unground them and do so, as well as organize them into subassem-
blies, and so on.
You should be aware, too, that any additional modeling that you do in the derived part or 
assembly will not push back to the multi-body part fi le. Although this may seem like a limita-
tion, it can also be viewed as a good thing, allowing for the separation of design tasks that some 
design departments require. Here are the general steps for creating components from a multi-
body part fi le:
 
1. Click the Make Components button on the Manage tab and then select the solid bodies 
from which you want to create parts.
 
2. Select additional solids to add to the list or select from the list and click Remove From 
Selection to exclude any solids that you decide you do not want to create parts from.
 
3. Select Insert Components In Target Assembly; then set the assembly name, the template 
from which to create it, and the save path, or clear this option to create the parts only. If 
the assembly already exits, use the Target Assembly Location’s Browse button to select it.

Creating Derived Parts and Assemblies
You can create parts derived from other components using the Derive tool. Common uses of 
the Derive tool are to create scaled and mirrored versions of existing parts, to cut one part from 
another part, and to consolidate an assembly into a single-part fi le. Nonlinear scaling is accom-
plished using an add-in available in the Inventor installation directory.

CREATING DERIVED PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES | 231
Creating Derived Parts
Derived parts are base solids that are linked to the original feature-based part. Modifi cations 
to the derived part in the form of additional features are allowed. Original features are modi-
fi ed in the parent part, and changes to the parent part are moved to the derived part upon save 
and update. There is no reasonable limit to the number of times the parent part or succeeding 
derived parts can be derived again into more variations.
Deriving a Part File
To derive a single-part fi le, follow these steps:
 
1. From a new part fi le, select the Manage tab and then click the Derive button.
 
2. In the Open dialog box, browse to the part fi le and then click the Open button.
 
3. Select from one of these derived styles:
 
◆
A single solid body with no seams between faces that exist in the same plane
 
◆
A single solid body with seams
 
◆
One or more solid bodies (if the source part contains multiple bodies)
 
◆
A single surface body

click the status icon next to each individual object to set the include/exclude status.
 
5. Optionally, click the Select From Base button to open the base component in a window to 
select the components.
 
6. Specify the scale factor and mirror plane if desired.
 
7. Click the OK button.
If the part being derived contains just one body, it is displayed on-screen. If the part being 
derived is a multi-body part with only a single body set as visible in the part, it is displayed on-
screen. If the part being derived is a multi-body part with more than one visible body, no bodies 
are displayed on-screen. Select the bodies to include by expanding the Solid Bodies folder 
and toggling the status. To include all bodies, select the Solid Bodies folder and then click the 
Include Status button. Figure 5.31 shows the Derived Part dialog box.

Modifying Derived Parts
Often, you will need to modify a derived part source fi le after having derived it into a new part. 
To do so, you can access the source part or assembly from the Model browser of the derived part 
by double-clicking it in the browser or by right-clicking it in the browser and choosing Open 
Base Component. The original fi le is opened in a new window where you can make changes as 
needed. To update the derived part to refl ect changes to the source fi le, use the Update button on 
the Quick Access bar (the top of the screen).
You can edit a derived part or assembly by right-clicking it in the browser and choosing Edit 
Derived Part or Edit Derived Assembly. This will open the same dialog box used to create the 
derived part so that you can change the options and selections you set when the derived part 
was created. Updates will be refl ected in the fi le when you click the OK button. The Edit Derived 
Part or Edit Derived Assembly options are unavailable if the derived part needs to be updated.
You can also break or suppress the link with the source fi le by right-clicking the derived 
component in the browser and choosing the appropriate option. Updates made to the source fi le 
will not be made to the derived part when the link is suppressed or broken. Suppressed links 
can be unsuppressed by right-clicking and choosing Unsuppressed Link From Base Component. 
Breaking the link is permanent; it cannot be restored.
Using the Component Derive Tool
Another way to derive components is to use the Derive Component tool on the Assembly Tools tab 
while in an assembly fi le. This tool allows you to select a part on-screen (or select a subassembly 
from the browser) and then specify a name for the new derived part fi le. You’ll then be taken into 
the new derived part fi le. The resulting derived part or assembly uses the default derive options 
and the active assembly representations as they are saved in the source fi le. You can use the edit 
option in the derived part to change the settings if needed.
Working with Patterns
Inventor includes two tools to create patterns:
 
◆
Circular Pattern tool
 
◆
Rectangular Pattern tool
Certiﬁcation
Objective

234 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
The Circular Pattern tool does just what you’d expect it to; it patterns a feature or set of 
features around an axis. The Rectangular Pattern tool also does what you’d expect, plus 
more. Using the Rectangular Pattern tool, you can create a pattern along any curve. If you 
select two perpendicular straight lines, edges, or axes, the result will be a rectangular pat-
tern. However, if you select an entity that is not straight, the pattern will follow the curvature 
of the selected entity.
Rectangular Patterns
Rectangular patterns use straight edges to establish the pattern directions. You can select a sin-
gle feature or several features for use in the pattern. Be sure to check the Model browser to see 
that you have only the features that you intend to pattern-select because it is easy to accidentally 
select base features when attempting select negative cut features. Start your exploration of pat-
terns by creating a simple rectangular pattern, as shown here:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_5a_018.ipt from your Chapter 05 directory.
 
3. Click the Rectangular Pattern button on the Pattern panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
4. With the Features button enabled, select the three features whose names start with the 
word switch in the browser.
 
5. Right-click, choose Continue to set the selection focus from Features to Direction 1, and 
then click the straight edge, indicated in Figure 5.33. Use the Flip Direction button to 
ensure that the direction arrow is pointing toward the round end of the part.

9. Click the Midplane check box in the Direction 2 settings to ensure that you get two 
instances of the pattern to each side of the original.
 
10. Click the OK button, and you will see the resulting pattern.
Circular Patterns
You can pattern features around an axis using the Circular Pattern tool. Angular spacing 
between patterned features can be set in two ways:
Incremental  Positioning specifi es the angular spacing between occurrences. Example: four 
holes at 90-degree increments.
Fitted  Positioning specifi es the total area the pattern occupies. Example: four holes fi t into 
90 degrees.
You can enter a negative value to create a pattern in the opposite direction, and you can use 
the Midplane check box to pattern in both directions from the original.
Continue from the previous exercise with the open fi le, or open mi_5a_020.ipt to start 
where that exercise ended:
 
1. In the Model browser, select the end-of-part marker, and drag it down below the feature 
named Indicator Cut. Or right-click the feature named Indicator Cut and choose Move 
EOP Marker.
 
2. Click the Circular Pattern button on the Pattern panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
3. With the Features button enabled, select the feature named Indicator Cut.
 
4. Right-click and choose Continue to set the selection focus from features to axis.
 
5. Select the center face of the feature named Indicator Stud Hole.
 
6. Set the count to 4 and the angle to 90; then click the >> button.
 
7. In the Positioning Method area, click the Incremental option so that the four occur-
rences of the pattern are set 90 degrees apart rather than being fi t into a 90-degree span. 
Alternatively, you could set the angle to 360 and leave the positioning method to Fitted 
and get the same result.
 
8. Click the OK button. Figure 5.34 shows the resulting circular pattern.

236 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
You’ll note that your patterned objects require some adjustments. One of the occurrences 
of the Indicator Cut interferes with the switch feature, and the one opposite of that does 
not cut through the part correctly (use the ViewCube to look underneath the part to see 
this clearly). To resolve this, you will fi rst edit the circular pattern and change the way 
the occurrences solve, and then you’ll suppress the occurrence of the switch feature in the 
rectangular pattern.
 
9. Right-click the circular pattern in the browser and choose Edit Feature, or double-click it 
in the browser.
 
10. Click the >> button to reveal the Creation Method area and then select the Adjust option. 
This allows each instance of the pattern to solve uniquely based on the geometry of the 
model when the feature is using a Through or Through All termination solution.
 
11. Click the OK button and examine the pattern again, and you’ll notice that the top 
instance of the indicator cut that was not cutting all the way through the part now is.
 
12. Expand the rectangular pattern in the browser to reveal the listing of each pattern 
occurrence.
 
13. Roll your mouse pointer over each occurrence node in the browser until you highlight 
the one that interferes with the circular pattern.
 
14. Right-click that occurrence and choose Suppress.
Any occurrence other than the fi rst can be suppressed to allow for pattern exceptions or to 
create unequal pattern spacing. Figure 5.35 shows the adjusted patterns.

Patterns along Curves
Although the Circular Pattern tool allows you to pattern objects around a center axis, it does 
not provide a way to keep the patterned objects in the same orientation as the original. To do so, 
you can use the rectangular pattern. Keep in mind that the term rectangular pattern is a bit of a 
misnomer; this tool might more accurately be described as a Curve Pattern tool because it allows 
you to select any curve, straight or not, and use it to determine the pattern directions. Continue 
from the previous exercise with the open fi le, or open mi_5a_022.ipt to start where that exer-
cise ended; then follow these steps:

open mi_5a_024.ipt to start where that exercise ended. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In the Model browser, select the end-of-part marker and drag it down below the feature 
named Coil Pattern Sketch. Or right-click the sketch named Coil Pattern Sketch and 
choose Move EOP Marker.
 
2. Click the Coil button on the 3D Model tab (note that the Coil button is found in the fl yout 
menu along with the Sweep and Loft buttons).
 
3. In the Coil dialog box, set the output to Surface.
 
4. In the graphics area on-screen, choose the line segment in the Coil Pattern Sketch feature 
at the base of the part for the Profi le selection.
 
5. Select the visible work axis in the center of the part for the Axis selection.
 
6. Click the Coil Size tab and set the type to Revolution and Height.
 
7. Set Height to 25 mm and Revolutions to 4.
 
8. Click the OK button to create the coiled surface.
You’ll now create two work points based on the coil location for use in placing holes. 
Once the holes are placed, you can pattern them using the surface coil.
 
9. Click the Point button on the Work Features panel of the 3D Model tab and select the ver-
tical tangent edge and the surface coil to create work points at the intersections, as shown 
in Figure 5.37.

Pattern Solids
Oftentimes a part can be modeled as a base feature and then patterned as a whole to create the 
completed part. Once the part is patterned, nonsymmetrical features can be added and/or pat-
terned occurrences can be suppressed. You can also use the Pattern Entire Solid option to create 
separate solid bodies when creating multi-body part fi les is the goal. To take a look at patterning 
these options, open the part named mi_5a_028.ipt and follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Rectangular Pattern tool on the Pattern panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
2. Click the Pattern A Solid button so that the entire part is selected to be patterned. Notice 
the two buttons that appear in the top-right corner of the dialog box:
Join  This option is used to pattern the solid as a single solid body.
Create New Bodies  This option is used to pattern the solid as separate solid bodies for 
multi-body part creation.
 
3. Leave this option set to Join and set Direction 1 to pattern the solid in the direction of the 
part width four times at a spacing of 10 mm.
 
4. Set Direction 2 to pattern the solid in the direction of the part thickness two times at a 
spacing of 3 mm, as shown in Figure 5.39.

5. Expand the pattern in the Model browser and right-click to suppress the two middle 
occurrences on the top level. Roll your mouse pointer over each occurrence to see it high-
light on-screen to identify which occurrences are the correct ones. Figure 5.40 shows the 
results of suppressing the correct occurrences.

6. Now you’ll pattern the entire solid again. Select the Rectangular Pattern tool again and 
click the Pattern A Solid button.
 
7. Set Direction 1 to pattern the solid in the direction of the part length two times at 
a spacing of 50 mm.
 
8. Set Direction 2 to pattern the solid in the direction of the part width two times at 
a spacing of 40 mm, as shown in Figure 5.41.
 
9. Create a new 2D sketch on one of the long narrow faces and project the tangent edge of 
the slot cuts or sketch a rectangle on the face. Do this for both ends of the face. Then use 
the Extrude tool, set the extents to To, and select the vertex, as shown in Figure 5.42. The 
result will be the removal of all the partial slot features.

10. Create another sketch on the same face, sketch an arc from corner to corner, and set the 
radius to 400 mm. Then use the Extrude tool to extrude just the arc as a surface (click the 
Surface Output button in the Extrude dialog box). Set the extents to To again and select 
the same vertex you previously selected.
 
11. Select the Replace Face tool from the Surface panel of the 3D Model tab. You may have to 
expand the arrow on the Surface panel to expand the drop-down to fi nd the Replace Face tool.

Dynamic Patterns
It is often desirable to have features such as holes set up in a standard spacing that will dynami-
cally update based on changes to the overall length. You can do this by setting up your patterns 

WORKING WITH PATTERNS | 243
with parameter formulas to calculate the spacing from the length parameter. Parts set up in this 
way can then be saved as template parts, allowing you to select them for new part creation and 
simply edit the length parameter. To set up a dynamic pattern, open the fi le mi_5a_032.ipt and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Manage tab and select the Parameters tool.
 
2. Notice that many of the dimensions in this part have been named. This is good practice 
when creating formulas. To create a formula to determine the spacing, click the Add 
Numeric button in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. This will create a new user-
defi ned parameter. Enter Adjust_Len for the parameter name (recall that spaces are not 
allowed in parameter names).
 
3. Click the unit cell and set the Units to ul, meaning unitless.
 
4. Type isolate(Length - End_Offset;ul;mm) into the Equation column. There are two parts 
to this equation:
Length - End_Offset  Subtracts the distance from the end of the part from the overall 
length of the part
Isolate (expression; unit; unit)  Neutralizes the distance unit mm so that the Adjust_
Len parameter can read it as unitless
 
5. Click the cell for the Count equation and enter isolate(ceil(Adjust_Len / 
Spacing);ul;mm) in the cell. There are three parts to this equation:
Adjust_Len / Spacing  Divides the adjusted length distance by the value specifi ed in the 
pattern spacing
Ceil (expression)  Bumps the value up to the next highest whole number
Isolate (expression; unit; unit)  Neutralizes the distance unit mm so that the Count pa-
rameter can read it as unitless
 
6. Click the Done button and then use the Update button to update the part (you can fi nd 
the Update button on the Quick Access bar at the top of the screen). Figure 5.46 shows the 
Parameters dialog box.
Figure 5.46
Formulas to 
adjust the hole 
spacing

244 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
You might notice that because the length value is currently set to 111 mm, the last hole is run-
ning off the part. Because the equation used the Ceil function to bump the calculated value to 
the next whole number, the count will always be on the high end. Depending on the part length, 
this may leave you with an extra hole. You can suppress the occurrence of this hole in the Model 
browser quite easily. Another approach is to remove the Ceil function and allow Inventor to 
round the calculated value up or down automatically. Depending on the length and spacing 
values, this might leave you with a missing hole at the end of the pattern where a value gets 
rounded down. Both are valid options, and you can decide which works best for your situation.
Edit Extrusion1 to adjust the part length, and try different values to see how the hole count 
drops out. You can also open the fi les mi_5a_033.ipt and mi_5a_034.ipt to examine similar 
hole patterns. In mi_5a_033.ipt, the Distance option is used in the pattern feature to evalu-
ate the length of the part. It holds an end offset value and then spaces the holes evenly along 
that distance. In mi_5a_034.ipt, the pattern is calculated from the center of the part rather 
than coming off one end. These are just a few examples of how to use user parameters to create 
dynamic patterns. There are other variations as well. In the next sections, you’ll take a more in-
depth look at parameters.
Setting iProperties and Parameters
Parameters in part and assembly fi les can provide powerful control over individual parts and 
assemblies while also improving effi ciency within designs. Part parameters enable the use of 
iParts, which are a form of table-driven parts. Assembly parameters enable the use of table-
driven assemblies and confi gurations. Parameters are accessed through the Tools menu and 
within the Part Features and Assembly tool panels. In addition to parameters, you can use 
iProperties to add information to your fi les.
iProperties
iProperties, generically known as fi le properties, allow the input of information specifi c to the 
active fi le. The iProperties dialog box is accessed through the File drop-down in Inventor. iProp-
erties are a powerful way to pass information from the model fi les to the drawing fi le, allowing 
you to fi ll out information in title blocks, standard notes, and parts list automatically. The dialog 
box contains several tabs for input of information:
General  Contains information on the fi le type, size, and location. The creation date, last 
modifi ed date, and last accessed date are preserved on this tab.
Summary  Includes part information such as title, subject, author, manager, and company. 
Included on this tab are fi elds for information that will allow searching for similar fi les 
within Windows.
Project  Stores fi le-specifi c information that, along with information from the Summary, 
Status, Custom, and Physical tabs, can be exported to other fi les and used in link information 
within the 2D drawing fi le.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

SETTING IPROPERTIES AND PARAMETERS | 245
Status  Allows the input of information and the control of the design state and dates of each 
design step.
Custom  Allows the creation of custom parameters for use within the design. Parameters 
exported from the Parameters dialog box will also appear in the list. Formulas can be used 
within a custom parameter to populate values in preexisting fi elds within the Project and 
Status tabs.
Save  Determines the behavior of the current fi le upon save.
Physical  Allows for changing the material type used in the current fi le and displays the 
calculated physical properties of the current part, such as mass and moment of inertia, as 
determined by the material type.
Active use of iProperties will help the designer in improving overall productivity as well 
as provide the ability to link part and assembly information into 2D drawings. Adding search 
properties in the Summary tab will assist the user in locating similar fi les.
Custom iProperties are either created manually in the Custom tab of iProperties or created 
automatically by exporting individual parameters from the Parameter dialog. Custom iProper-
ties may be linked to drawings and assemblies for additional functionality.
Accessing iProperties Through Windows Explorer
When you right-click an Inventor ﬁ le in Windows Explorer and choose Properties, you can select the 
iProperties tab from the ﬁ le properties dialog box. Clicking the iProperties button on the iProper-
ties tab opens the Inventor iProperties dialog box just as you would see it in Inventor.
Th is can oﬀ er people in the oﬃ  ce who do not have access to Inventor the ability to view and change 
iProperties when needed. For instance, someone in the manufacturing department can use this to 
set the Mfg. Approved Date iProperty once a part has been successfully built on the shop ﬂ oor based 
on a given drawing and/or part ﬁ le. To change iProperties without having Inventor installed, you 
can install Inventor View. Inventor View can be downloaded for free from the Autodesk website.
You can also use the Details tab in this way to quickly conﬁ rm the Inventor version the ﬁ le was 
created in and last saved under.
Part Parameters
Part parameters are composed of model parameters, user parameters, reference parameters, 
and custom parameters. Model parameters are automatically embedded as a part is dimen-
sioned and features are created. Most are a mirror image of the sketch-creation process. As each 
dimension is created on a sketch, a corresponding model parameter is created, starting with a 
parameter called d0 and incrementing each time a new parameter is created. When you name a 
dimension, you are changing the automatically assigned parameter name. To access the list of 
parameters, select the Manage tab and click the Parameters button. Figure 5.47 represents a typi-
cal parameter list.

Part parameter list
Looking across the top of the dialog box, you will see columns for the parameter name, unit 
type, equation, nominal value, tolerance type, model value, parameter export, and descriptive 
comments. Take a look at each of these columns:
Parameter Name  The values in this column correspond to the name of the parameters 
assigned as the part is built. Each parameter name starts with a lowercase d followed by a 
numeric value. The parameters can be renamed to something that is more familiar, such as 
Length, Height, Base_Dia, or any other descriptive single word. Spaces are not allowed in the 
parameter name. Hovering your mouse pointer over a name will initiate a tool tip that will 
tell you where that variable is used or consumed. Parameters can be of three types:
 
◆
Model parameters are created from dimensions or dialog box inputs that drive the 
geometry.
 
◆
Reference parameters are created from dimensions that are driven by other geometry 
entities.
 
◆
User parameters are created by you, the user, and are used in formulas and iLogic 
rules or referenced by model parameters.
Unit/Type  The unit type defi nes the unit used in the calculation. Normally, the unit type 
will be set by the process that created it. When a user parameter is created, you will be pre-
sented with a Unit Type dialog box when you click in the Unit column. This will allow you to 
select a particular unit type for the user parameter.
Equation  This column either specifi es a static value or allows you to create algebraic-style 
equations using other variables or constants to modify numeric values.
Nominal Value  This column displays the result of the equation.
Tolerance  This column shows the current evaluated size setting for the parameter. Click 
the cell to select Upper, Lower, or Nominal tolerance values. This will change the size of tol-
erance features in the model.
Model Value  This column shows the actual calculated value of the parameter.
Key  A parameter can be made a key by selecting the key check box for the parameter row.
Export Parameter  These check boxes are activated to add specifi c parameters to the custom 
properties for the model. Downstream, custom properties can be added to parts lists and 

SETTING IPROPERTIES AND PARAMETERS | 247
bills of materials by adding columns. Clearing the check box will remove that parameter as 
a custom property. After a parameter is added, other fi les will be able to link to or derive the 
exported parameter. Text and True/False parameters cannot be exported.
Comment  This column is used to help describe the use of a parameter. Linked parameters 
will include the description within the link.
User Parameters
User parameters are simply parameters that a user creates by clicking the Add button in the 
lower-left portion of the Parameters dialog box. You can add numeric, text, and True/False 
parameters; however, only numeric parameters may be exported or contain expressions. Text 
and True/False parameters can be created for use in iLogic rules. User parameters can be used 
to store equations that drive features and dimensions in the model. The user-created parameter 
can utilize algebraic operators written in the proper syntax that will create an expression in a 
numerical value.
Reference Parameters
Reference parameters are driven parameters that are created through the use of reference dimen-
sions in sketches and the use of derived parts, attached via a linked spreadsheet, created by table-
driven iFeatures, or created through the use of the application programming interface (API). 
For instance, Inventor sheet-metal parts create fl at pattern extents, which are stored as reference 
parameters.
Formatting Parameters
If needed, you can format the parameter to display differently than the default display. To do 
so, you must fi rst select the Export Parameter check box in the Parameters dialog box for the 
parameter you intend to customize. Once the parameter is selected for export, you can right-
click that parameter and choose Custom Property Format to access the Custom Property Format 
settings. In the Custom Property Format dialog box you can change property type, units, for-
mat, and precision as well as control the display of unit strings, leading zeros, and trailing zeros. 
When you’ve confi gured the parameter formatting, it is refl ected in the custom iProperty for 
that parameter.
For instance, if you have a part dimension length of 100.00 mm and you want to call that 
length into the part description but do not want to see the units string (mm) or the zeros after 
the decimal point, you would go to the Manage tab, click the Parameters button, and then select 
the Export Parameter check box for the length parameter. Then you’d right-click the length 
parameter and choose the Custom Property Format option. And then fi nally you’d uncheck 
the Unit String and Leading Zeros options. To see the results, you’d exit the Parameters dia-
log box and then right-click the top-level node in the browser (typically the fi lename), choose 
iProperties, and then click the Custom tab to fi nd the custom iProperty that corresponds to the 
exported parameter.

One of the most important aspects of working with parameters is the ability to create expres-
sions using the available parameter functions. The functions in Table 5.1 can be used in user

250 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
Setting Up User Parameters in Your Templates
Although many times parameters are used to control design input on a per-design basis, you can 
often use preestablished parameters in template ﬁ les, so only a couple of key parameters need to be 
changed in the part ﬁ le to create a new variant of a standard part. User parameters are especially 
powerful when these types of template parts are created.
Consider, for example, a standard-type mounting bracket. Th e general shape is carried through in 
all iterations, but you can identify several key dimensions that are driven by the particulars of each 
new design situation. Dimensions such as length, width, height, and thickness are good examples 
of parameters that can be identiﬁ ed and set up in a template part.
Other things to consider for use as parameters would be critical dimensions such as the locations 
of holes from the edge of the part, hole sizes, hole counts, and hole spacing. If the hole oﬀ set is 
determined by the material thickness and hole size, then a formula can be established in the part 
template to calculate the minimum oﬀ set value.
Once the part parameters are created and tested for accuracy, the part can be turned into a template 
by using the Save Copy As Template option in the Save As menu. Th is will save the part ﬁ le in the 
Template directory. Template parts can be as simple or complex as you need, but generally this 
works best for simple parts. For more complex parts, consider creating iParts, covered in Chapter 7, 
“Reusing Parts and Features.”
When creating parameter-based template parts, you might want to consider creating user param-
eters with descriptive names for all the key parameters so they are all grouped together. Th is way, 
you (or another user) can quickly identify key parameters used to drive the design later when 
creating parts in your real-world designs.
Assembly Parameters
Assembly parameters function in much the same way as part parameters except they will gen-
erally control constraint values such as offset and angle. When you’re authoring an iAssembly, 
other parameters will be exposed for usage, such as assembly features, work features, iMates, 
and component patterns, as well as other parameters that may exist within an assembly.
Adding Part Tolerances
Inventor allows you to analyze parts in a manner that ensures valid fi t and function at dimen-
sional extremes. When parts are assembled within an Inventor assembly fi le, you can check to 
ensure that the parts can be assembled without interference, by setting each part to evaluate at 
the upper or lower tolerance value. By specifying dimensional tolerances within parts, you are 
capturing valuable design data that will assist in manufacturing and assembly. In addition to 
creating the parts separately and then assembling them, you can use multi-body parts to create 
mated parts in one fi le, making it easy to design tolerances across multiple parts.

ADDING PART TOLERANCES | 251
Less Is Often More with Tolerances
When considering part designs for manufacturing, be careful not to apply precise tolerance values 
where they are not necessary for the design and assembly. Excessive and unneeded tolerances 
during the design phase can substantially increase the cost to manufacture each part. Th e secret 
to good design is to know where to place tolerances and where to allow shop tolerances to occur.
Tolerances are an important tool for communicating design intent to manufacturing. Large 
tolerances indicate that the dimensions aren’t critical to the part’s function, whereas tight toler-
ances indicate that manufacturing needs to pay extra attention to that machining operation. 
Loosening up tolerances can help manufacturing reduce the reject rate, while tightening up cer-
tain tolerances can reduce rework during the assembly process or in the fi eld.
Tolerances in Sketches
You can add tolerances to any individual sketch dimension by right-clicking and choosing 
Dimension Properties to set precision and tolerance values. You can also access the tolerance 
setting from within the dimension edit box to set the tolerance as you set the value. Altering 
the dimension to adjust for tolerance and precision using either method will not affect any 
other dimension within the part. However, a global fi le tolerance can be specifi ed within a 
part using the Document Settings dialog box and will affect every dimension within 
the model.
In addition to the Dimension Properties menu option and the dimension edit box option, you 
can access and modify tolerances in the Parameters dialog box. Using the Parameters controls, 
you can set parameter values for multiple dimensions to include the tolerance as needed. No 
matter how you access the tolerance setting, there are four options you can use to evaluate the 
dimension/parameter:
+ Upper  The upper tolerance value in a stacked display. This value should be Maximum 
Material Condition (MMC). For a hole, the smallest diameter is MMC, whereas for a shaft the 
largest diameter is MMC.
▲ Median  The midway point between the upper and lower tolerances. This is commonly 
used when Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines are programmed from the solid 
model.
– Lower  The lower tolerance in a stacked display. This value should be Least Material 
Condition (LMC). For a hole, the largest diameter is LMC, while for a shaft the smallest diam-
eter is LMC.
• Nominal  This is the actual value of the dimension.
Figure 5.48 shows the access to the tolerance settings through the sketch dimension edit box 
as well as the settings in the Tolerance dialog box. In this case a deviation tolerance is placed on 
the 36 mm diameter, and the model is set to evaluate at the upper value (note that the plus sign 
is selected). Since this document’s settings are defaulted to three places, all sketch dimensions 
are in three places to start. In the illustration, the precision has been set to just two decimal 
places, for just this dimension.

252 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
Figure 5.48
Sketch showing 
tolerances
Tolerance vs. Allowance
Tolerance is the acceptable (but undesired) deviation from the intended (nominal) dimension.
Allowance is the intended (desired) diﬀ erence of dimensions between two mating parts, depending 
on the type of ﬁ t speciﬁ ed.
Setting Global File Tolerances
Adding tolerances during the design phase pays dividends down the road. There will be fewer 
errors creating drawings, and tolerances provide clues to design decisions that are useful when 
updating an existing part. You might fi nd using standard tolerances makes the design process 
more effi cient because the designer needs to focus only on the general tolerance for a dimension 
(two-place vs. three-place tolerance) and apply special tolerances where needed. You can create 
custom templates to store tolerance types and other settings for each standard. When the part is 
created using such a template, standard tolerance values can be overridden for specifi c dimen-
sional values, or you can override all tolerances within a fi le or just a specifi c dimension.
An example of this type of tolerance would be a tolerance rule that states that all decimal 
dimensions held to two places shall be +/− 0.05 and all decimal dimensions held to three places 
shall be +/− 0.001, meaning a dimension of 0.50 would be held to an upper limit of 0.55 and a 
lower limit of 0.45, whereas a dimension of 0.500 would be held to an upper limit of 0.501 and a 
lower limit of 0.499.
You can create and modify global tolerance values within a single part by selecting the 
Tools tab, clicking Document Settings, and then clicking the Default Tolerance tab within an 
active part fi le or template. By default, a fi le will not be using any tolerance standards. In Figure 
5.49, the Use Standard Tolerancing Values box has been selected to enable the addition of new 
standards for the fi le. To export the tolerance values to the drawing fi les, the Export Standard 
Tolerance Values would need to be selected as well.

settings for 
tolerance
Once the tolerance values are set, the dimension in the part will evaluate at the nominal 
value, meaning that if you entered a value of 36 for a part length, that is what the length would 
be. To evaluate the model at its upper limit at +/− 0.001, you would edit the dimension for the 
length and set the precision to three places and the evaluated size to Upper (using the + button). 
The length would then change to 36.05, if you are using the earlier example. The default toler-
ances are set to +/– tolerances. To select another tolerance standard, simply override the existing 
tolerance values in the tolerance setting and choose another tolerance type, such as deviation. 
You can see all of this in action in the following steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; then open the part named mi_5a_035.ipt in the 
Chapter 05 folder.
 
2. Select the Tools tab and then click the Document Settings tab.
 
3. Select the Default Tolerance tab and notice that there are two linear tolerance standards 
and one angular tolerance standard already set up. Note that there is a linear precision 
for one decimal and another for two decimals, but there is not one for three decimals. 
Keep this in mind as you proceed.
 
4. Click the check box to use the standard tolerancing values, click the Apply button, and 
then click the Close button.
Now that the part is set to use a global part tolerance, you will edit a dimension and 
change the precision setting to two decimals so it will use one of the global linear 
tolerance settings. It is important to note that the dimension precision for all of the 
dimensions in the part is currently set to three decimal places (the default setting).
 
5. Edit the 15 mm dimension by double-clicking the text of the dimension.
 
6. Click the fl yout arrow in the dimension input box and select Tolerance.

254 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
7. Set the precision to just one decimal place and then click the blue plus sign to evaluate the 
dimension at its upper value.
 
8. Click the OK button to exit the Tolerance dialog box and then click the green check mark 
in the dimension edit box.
 
9. Although the sketch automatically updates to evaluate the dimension at its upper value, 
you’ll need to update the model to see the solid update. Click the Update button on the 
Quick Access bar (at the top of the screen; it looks like a lightning bolt).
 
10. To evaluate the entire part at the lower value, select the Manage tab and click the 
Parameters button.
 
11. In the Parameters dialog box, click the red minus sign in the Reset Tolerance area and 
then ensure the Immediate Update check box is selected to see the Model Values column 
update.
Compare the nominal and model values in the parameter table to see that some of the 
dimensions are now reevaluated. Since the dimension default precision for the part is set 
to three places, the 25 mm and 3 mm dimensions are using that precision (for which no 
tolerance was set) and therefore have no lower value. Don’t be confused by the precision 
being displayed in the Parameters table because that precision is display only. You can 
click the Equation cell for each dimension and then right-click and choose Tolerance to 
access the tolerance and precision settings for each dimension to see or change them.
 
12. Click Done to exit the Parameters dialog.
 
13. To change the global dimension precision, select the Tools tab and click the Document 
Settings button.
 
14. Select the Units tab and set Modeling Dimension Display for Linear Dim Display 
Precision to two places; then click the OK button.
Now the 25 mm dimension is using the fi le default precision of two places, and since it is still 
set to evaluate at the lower value, it changes to 24.99. You can begin to see the power of using 
tolerances in your models to evaluate tolerance ranges as you design. You can close this fi le 
without saving changes. In the next section you’ll look at using limits and fi ts tolerances.
Part Tolerances in Drawings
Keep in mind that when a part is used in the drawing environment, it will reﬂ ect the current 
evaluated model dimensions and will show the tolerance callout only for retrieved dimensions.
Typically, it is best to create multiple dimension styles with various precision and/or tolerance 
options in the drawing environment and handle tolerance dimensioning for the print using those 
tools. You must keep in mind that the tolerance settings in the part are designed to function with 
the assembly environment and allow calculating tolerances and stack-ups within the assembly. 
Th ey are not meant to provide tolerancing in the drawing environment.

ADDING PART TOLERANCES | 255
Working with Limits and Fits
A fi t tolerance defi nes the way two components mate together. There are three basic categories 
of fi ts:
Clearance  This allows the mating components to slide together freely so they can be assem-
bled and disassembled easily.
Transition  This provides a fi t close enough to securely hold the two components together 
but still allow them to be disassembled.
Interference  Often called a press fi t or friction fi t, Interference provides a means to hold 
two components together by slightly oversizing one component that fi ts into the other. Some 
force is required to achieve the fi tting of the two components together, and disassembly is 
not intended.
You can create parts according to fi ts by adding tolerance values to sketch dimensions and 
setting the tolerance type to one of the Limits/Fits options. Using a fi ts table as a reference, you 
can then set the tolerance according to the desired fi t type.
In the following exercise, you will edit a part and set tolerances for the two mating solid bod-
ies, using Table 5.2 as guide for the fi ts. To start, you will set the inside and outside diameters to 
use tolerances based on a common diameter of 36 mm. The goal is have a loose fi t that allows 
the insert to slip freely into the sleeve. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; then open the part named mi_5a_036.ipt from your 
Chapter 05 folder.
 
2. Select the dimension called Sleeve_ID and double-click to bring up the dimension 
edit box.
 
3. Click the fl yout arrow and choose Tolerance from the list.
 
4. Set the Type drop-down to Limit/Fits-Show Size Limits.
 
5. Set the Hole drop-down to H11 to create a loose running fi t, as listed in Table 5.2.
 
6. Click the red minus sign to evaluate the inside diameter at its lower limit.
 
7. Click the OK button to exit the Tolerance dialog box and then click the green check mark 
in the dimension edit box.
 
8. Select the dimension called Insert_OD and double-click it to bring up the dimension 
edit box.
 
9. Click the fl yout arrow and choose Tolerance from the list.
 
10. Set the Type drop-down to Limit/Fits-Show Size Limits.
 
11. Set the Shaft drop-down to c11 to create the other half of the loose running fi t.
 
12. Click the blue plus sign to evaluate the outside diameter at its upper limit.
 
13. Click the OK button to exit the Tolerance dialog box and then click the green check mark 
in the dimension edit box.

256 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
 
14. Zoom in on the cutout in the sleeve, and you’ll see a green arrow on one corner. Zoom in 
closer on the green arrow, and you will see the gap between the diameter sketches of the 
sleeve and the insert refl ecting your tolerance edits. However, the model itself currently 
displays no tolerance and needs to be updated to match the sketch.

15. Click the Update button on the Quick Access bar (it looks like a lightning bolt at the top 
of the screen).
You should see a gap between the solids, providing a loose running fi t. Because the cur-
rent model is being evaluated at the extremes (the upper tolerance for the inside diameter 
and the lower for the outside diameter), you can determine whether the current design 
will provide the correct fi t. In the real world, you might determine that the outside 
diameter of the insert needs to be less than 36 mm for the nominal value so that you can 
ensure a better fi t.
Continue with the following steps to explore more options when working with part 
tolerances.
 
16. Zoom back out and then click once on any blank area of the graphics screen (to clear 
any currently selected entities). Then right-click, choose Dimension Display, and choose 
Tolerance from the fl yout menu. This will show you the evaluated dimension values, as 
shown in Figure 5.50.

17. Right-click either of the dimensions and choose Dimension Properties.
You’ll notice that you can set and adjust the tolerance options in this menu as well. You 
can use the Document Settings tab to set up standard tolerances for the entire fi le and change 
the precision and dimension display. These are the same settings you accessed by editing the 
dimensions and parameters in the previous steps.
This concludes the formal steps of this exercise, but you can continue experimenting with the 
tolerances using Table 5.2 as a reference. For instance, you might set up a press fi t and evaluate 
the inside diameter at the upper value and the outside at the lower to check to see whether there 
is indeed enough interference to provide a solid press fi t when both dimensions are evaluated at 
their extremes. (Note that Table 5.2 is not a complete fi ts list and is provided as reference for this 
exercise only.)
Working with Free-Form Modeling and 
Direct Editing Tools
Traditionally 3D parametric modelers such as Inventor have operated on the concepts of sketch 
and feature dependencies and a model history tree; this approach allows you to step back into 
the design and change parameters in order to edit the model. With the free-form modeling tools, 
you create features by moving, rotating, and scaling surface model points, edges, and faces. 
The Direct Editing tool allows you to add edits to the model tree without stepping back into the 
model design tree.
Free-Form Modeling
The typical free-form workfl ow starts with creating a free-form shape such as a box, sphere, 
cylinder, torus, or quad-ball. Once the shape is created, you use the free-form edit tools to refi ne 
and defi ne the shape by selecting points, faces, or edges of the shape and then moving, rotating, 
or scaling those selections.
Once the shape has been created and edited to the desired shape, you exit the free-form 
editing mode and are returned to the standard modeling mode where you can sketch and add 
features to further refi ne the model as needed.

258 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
Creating a Free-Form Shape
To explore the free-form modeling tools, you’ll open a fi le that has been derived from another 
fi le. This fi le contains a motorcycle frame, upon which you will create a fuel tank using the free-
form tools. 
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; then open the part named mi_5a_037.ipt in the 
Chapter 05 folder.
 
2. On the 3D Model tab, locate the Freeform panel and click the Box button.
 
3. Choose the XY Plane for the fi rst selection.
 
4. Choose visible work point in the graphics area (or select Work Point1 from the browser) 
for the second selection.
 
5. Set the Length input to 560 mm, set the Width input to 210 mm, and set the Height input 
to 260 mm.
 
6. Set the Faces input for the Length to 4 and leave the others at the default.
 
7. Click the Both Direction button in the Direction control to have the box form created 
equally on each side of the XY work plane. 
 
8. Click the OK button to create the box form.
Figure 5.51 shows the box form inputs. 
Figure 5.51
Creating a 
box form
Once your box is created, you’ll notice the form feature node created in the model browser 
as Form1 or something similar. Notice, too, that once you create a form, you are still in the free-
form editing mode, as indicated by the available selections in the Ribbon menu. You can close 
this fi le without saving changes.
Adding Symmetry to a Free-Form Shape
When you create a free-form shape, it is often helpful to allow the edits to the form to be made 
symmetrically in one or more planar directions. In Figure 5.51 you can see three check box con-
trols that allow you to specify that the form you create will automatically edit symmetrically 
in the selected directions. This can be useful if you know that the form will be symmetric in 

WORKING WITH FREEFORM MODELING AND DIRECT EDITING TOOLS  | 259
advance, but you can also turn symmetry on or off at any point in the free-form editing process, 
as illustrated in the following steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open; then open the part named mi_5a_038.ipt in the 
Chapter 05 folder.
 
2. In the browser, locate the feature named Form1 and double-click it (or right-click and 
choose Edit Freeform).
 
3. Next, click the drop-down arrow below the Edit Form button to expose the list of form 
editing tools and then click the Symmetry button in the list.
 
4. Click two opposing faces in order to establish symmetry down the center of the motor-
cycle, as shown in Figure 5.52.
Figure 5.52
Adding symme-
try to a form
 
5. Next click the OK button to set the symmetry.
 
6. Observe the gray line running through the center of the form that signifi es a symmetry 
condition exists on the form.
 
7. Click the Edit Form button on the Freeform panel of the 3D Model tab to bring up the 
Edit Form dialog box.
 
8. Click any face on the form shape and notice that the opposing, symmetric face is auto-
matically selected also.
 
9. Click and drag one of the arrow controls in the graphics area to see the symmetric edit in 
action.
 
10. Click and drag a different arrow control to see the symmetric edit in action again.
 
11. Experiment with the controls as you like (these will be explained in more detail in the 
steps to come) and then click the Done button to create the edits.
 
12. Click the drop-down arrow below the Edit Form button to expose the list of form editing 
tools. Then click the Clear Symmetry button in the list and notice that the gray symmetry 
line running through the center of the form has been removed.
Adding symmetry to a free-form shape allows you to more quickly and accurately create 
shape modifi cations when a symmetric relationship is desired. You can close this fi le and con-
tinue to the next section to further explore the free-form editing tools.

260 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
Editing a Free-Form Shape
The Edit Freeform tool contains several controls that can be used in combination or individu-
ally to manipulate a free-form shape precisely or visually. For instance, if you wanted to select a 
face and move it up based on your current view, you could change the Selection button from All 
to Face, change the Transform Mode button from All to Translation, and change the Transform 
Space button to View. Figure 5.53 shows the Edit Form dialog box controls followed by a short 
description of most of the buttons.

Using the Direct Edit Tool
The Direct Edit tool lets you make quick edits to existing features. You can make adjustments to 
the location, shape, and size of features by directly editing the geometry, rather than editing the 
sketch or feature that originally created the feature. Specifi cally, you can use the Direct Edit tool 
to do the following:
 
◆
Quickly explore “what if” design alternatives
 
◆
Modify imported parts
 
◆
Limit modifi cations to only the feature you choose, without risking the accidental modifi -
cation of dependent features
 
◆
Quickly update a complex model created by another user without needing to diagnose the 
feature structure

TROUBLESHOOTING FAILURES WITH THE ENDOFPART MARKER | 265
Using the Direct Edit Tool
In some ways the Direct Edit tool allows you “break the rules” in terms of best practices for editing 
and updating your 3D models. Generally it is better to locate the original feature or sketch and 
make the edit there. However, there are times when the Direct Edit tool might be the better choice.
For example, imagine you are tasked with implementing a quick engineering change order (ECO) 
to an existing part model created in the past by another user. When you look at the design, you see 
a complex hierarchy of dependent part features. Locating the sketch that was used to create the 
feature you want to change is diﬃ  cult, and it introduces the risk of modifying dependent features. 
Using the Direct Edit tool, however, allows you to change only the geometry you intend to, and it 
allows you to do so quickly without spending more time that you’ve been allowed to implement 
the change.
As a matter of best practice, the Direct Edit tool should be reserved for these types of situations 
and not used as a general modeling tool.
Troubleshooting Failures with the End-of-Part Marker
Once in a while, even the most skilled design engineer experiences a modeling or design failure. 
The part may be supplied by a customer or co-worker who has not practiced sound modeling 
techniques, or you may have to drastically modify a base feature in a part you designed. These 
kinds of edits change a base feature to the point that dependent features cannot solve, and a cas-
cade of errors can occur. Knowing how to fi x these errors can save you hours of work.
One of the best ways to troubleshoot a part and determine exactly how the part was origi-
nally modeled is to use the end-of-part (EOP) marker to step through the creation process. In the 
Model browser, drag the end-of-part marker to a location immediately below the fi rst feature. 
This will effectively eliminate all other features below the marker from the part calculation.
Often when making modifi cations to a part, you might change a feature that causes errors to 
cascade down through the part. Moving the end-of-part marker up to isolate the fi rst troubled 
feature allows you to resolve errors one at a time. Many times, resolving the topmost error will 
fi x those that exist after it. Figure 5.58 shows a model tree with a series of errors. On the right, 
the end-of-part marker has been moved up.
Step 1: Editing the First Feature
Normally, the fi rst feature will start with a sketch. Right-click the fi rst feature and select Edit 
Sketch. Examine the sketch for a location relative to the part origin point. Generally, the fi rst 
sketch should be located and anchored at the origin and fully dimensioned and constrained. If 
the sketch is not fully constrained, then add dimensions and constraints to correct it.
If you see sketch entities highlighted in magenta, you probably have projected geometry that 
has lost its parent feature. To resolve errors of this type, it is often required to break the link 
between the missing geometry and allow the projected entities to stand on their own. To do so, 
right-click the objects in the graphics area or expand the sketch in the browser, and right-click 
any projected or reference geometry that is showing errors; then choose Break Link. This frees 
up the geometry so that it can be constrained and dimensioned on its own or simply deleted. 
Figure 5.59 shows the Break Link option listed in the context menu for a projected loop.

266 | CHAPTER 5 ADVANCED MODELING TECHNIQUES
Figure 5.58

of-part marker 
to troubleshoot 
feature errors

Breaking 
projected 
object links
Once the sketch is free of errors, you can return to the feature level. Often, you’ll be greeted 
by an error message informing you that the feature is not healthy. Click Edit or Accept. Then 
edit the feature. Most often you will simply be required to reselect the profi le or reference geom-
etry. Once the feature is fi xed, drag the end-of-part marker below the next feature and repeat the 
step. Continue through the part until all sketches are properly constrained.
Occasionally, a base sketch may become “lost” and may need to be reassociated to a sketch 
plane. To do so, you can right-click and choose Redefi ne, as shown in Figure 5.60. Depending 
on how drastic the change in the sketch plane is, this may be all that is required. Often, though, 
you will need to edit the sketch, clean up some stray geometry using the Break Link option, and 
then dimension and constrain it so that it is stable.
Step 2: Moving the EOP Marker Down One Feature at a Time
Step 2 might be called “learn from your mistakes” (or other people’s mistakes). When you have 
part/feature failures, you should take advantage of them and analyze how the part was created 
to determine why the sketch or features became unstable. It’s always good practice to create 
the major features fi rst and then add secondary features such as holes, fi llets, and chamfers at 
the end of the part. On occasion, loft and sweep features may fail or produce incorrect results 
because fi llets and chamfers were created before the failed feature. To determine whether this is 
the case in your model, suppress any holes, fi llets, chamfers, or any other feature that you think 
might be causing the failure.

TROUBLESHOOTING FAILURES WITH THE ENDOFPART MARKER | 267
Figure 5.60
Redeﬁ ning a 
sketch
Once the failed feature is corrected, introduce one suppressed feature at a time until you 
encounter a failure. This will identify the cause. You may then attempt to move the offending 
feature below the failed feature and examine the result. If you are unable to move the offending 
feature, instead reproduce the same feature below the failed feature and leave the original sup-
pressed. When the problems are corrected in a part, you can go back and delete the suppressed 
offending features.
Although it’s not always a silver bullet, you might want to try the Rebuild All tool right after 
fi xing the fi rst broken sketch or feature. Often if the fi x was fairly minor, Rebuild All will save 
you from having to manually edit dependent features one at a time. You can access this tool by 
selecting the Manage tab and selecting Rebuild All.
Using the End-of-Part Marker to Time-Travel
Th e end-of-part marker is a powerful yet often-neglected tool. With this tool, you can go “back to 
the future” and edit or add features to your model. A good example of using the EOP marker is to 
preserve design intent. Let’s say you created a base feature, placed some holes down the center of 
the part (based on dimensions), and then altered the side faces of the part. Th e holes are linked to 
the unaltered edges of this part. You now want to tie the holes to the midplane of this part regard-
less of the feature size.
You could do this by placing a centered work plane down the part. However, you cannot do this 
now because when you go back to edit the hole sketch, the work plane would not be available for 
projection onto the sketch plane. You also cannot drag the work plane above the holes because it 
was created on the new, altered base feature faces. In this case, you’ll want to drag the EOP marker 
above the hole feature. Now you can place the work plane centered on the two faces. Drag the EOP 
marker back down to the bottom of the tree. Now edit the hole feature and project the work plane 
so that the hole centers can be constrained to it.
You can also use the EOP marker to reduce ﬁ le size when you email a model. If you drag the EOP 
marker to the top of the browser, only the feature tree (commonly called the part DNA or part 
recipe) is saved to disk. When the EOP marker is dragged down to the bottom again, all the feature 
data is recalculated.

Th e Bottom Line
Create complex sweeps and lofts.  Complex geometry is created by using multiple work 
planes, sketches, and 3D sketch geometry. Honing your experience in creating work planes 
and 3D sketches is paramount to success in creating complex models.
Master It  How would you create a piece of twisted, fl at bar in Inventor?
Work with multi-body and derived parts.  Multi-body parts can be used to create part fi les 
with features that require precise matching between two or more parts. Once the solid bod-
ies are created, you can create a separate part fi le for each component.
Master It  What would be the best way to create an assembly of four parts that require 
features to mate together in different positions?
Utilize part tolerances.  Dimensional tolerancing of sketches allows you to check stack-
up variations within assemblies. When you add tolerances to critical dimensions within 
sketches, you can adjust parts to maximum, minimum, and nominal conditions.
Master It  You want to create a model feature with a deviation so you can test the assem-
bly fi t at the extreme ends of the tolerances. How would this be done?
Understand and use parameters and iProperties.  Using parameters within fi les assists 
in the creation of title blocks, parts lists, and annotation within 2D drawings. Using param-
eters in an assembly fi le allows the control of constraints and objects within the assembly. 
Exporting parameters allows the creation of custom properties. Proper use of iProper-
ties facilitates the creation of accurate 2D drawings that always refl ect the current state of 
included parts and assemblies.
Master It  You want to create a formula to determine the spacing of a hole pattern based 
on the length of the part. What tools would you use?
Troubleshoot modeling failures.  Modeling failures are often caused by poor design 
practices. Poor sketching techniques, bad design workfl ow, and other factors can lead to the 
elimination of design intent within a model.
Master It  You want to modify a rather complex existing part fi le, but when you change 
the feature, errors cascade down through the entire part. How can you change the feature 
without this happening?

toolset, centered on productivity and capturing your manufacturing intent. When you fi rst 
begin working in the sheet-metal environment, you may feel overwhelmed because the tools 
and methods you have become familiar with to create other parts in Inventor do not yield good 
results in the sheet-metal fi le. However, a mastery of some basic fundamentals in sheet-metal 
tools can make Inventor sheet metal straightforward and highly integrated with your manu-
facturing environment. The Autodesk® Inventor LT™ program does not include the sheet-metal 
tools discussed in this chapter.

Understanding Sheet-Metal Parts
The sheet-metal environment was introduced in Inventor 2. Since sheet-metal parts have so 
many unique requirements, such as fl at patterns and manufacturing-specifi c features, a modi-
fi ed part fi le is used. The same .ipt fi lename extension is used for sheet-metal parts, but extra 
sheet-metal capabilities and data are added. To create a sheet-metal part, you can use the Sheet 
Metal.ipt template or simply click the Convert To Sheet Metal button on the Environments tab 
of a standard part fi le.
To understand how sheet-metal parts work, it is important to keep in mind that sheet-metal 
design is driven by manufacturing considerations. A basic sheet-metal part consists of fl at faces 
joined by bends. For cost-effective manufacturing, all the bends and corner reliefs are generally 
the same radius. The sheet-metal template style contains the sheet thickness, bend, and relief 
information in a rule, and the style is then used during modeling. This saves you considerable 

270 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
time during design because the features automatically use the settings in the predefi ned style. 
If you have to make a change, such as a different material thickness or bend radius, you can 
select a different style and the part automatically updates. These sheet-metal-specifi c styles are 
referred to as a sheet-metal rule.
Many sheet-metal parts are brackets or enclosures designed to fi t a particular assembly. The 
sheet-metal tools simplify the process of creating and updating models. For example, you can 
change a bend to a corner seam simply by right-clicking the bend in the browser and selecting 
Change To Corner from the context menu.
Getting to Know the Features
The Inventor sheet-metal environment contains numerous specialized tools to help you design 
components that follow your sheet-metal-manufacturing guidelines and process restrictions. 
The following sections describe general feature classifi cations and capabilities that will provide 
you with a quick road map to the features. Once you understand how the features work, you 
will be able to build models that capture your design intent.
Starting with a Base Feature
Out of all the sheet-metal tools provided, only four create what are referred to as base features. 
Base features are simply the fi rst features that appear in the feature history. The following tools 
can create base features:
 
◆
Face
 
◆
Contour Flange
 
◆
Contour Roll
 
◆
Lofted Flange
Face Tool
The Face tool is the simplest base feature; it utilizes a closed profi le to produce a simple extrusion 
with the height automatically set to the Thickness parameter value. The profi le can be constructed 
out of any shape and can even contain interior profi les, as shown in Figure 6.1. Profi les for face 
features are often generated from the edge projections of planar faces or surfaces found in other 
part fi les, and this capability enables numerous assembly-based and derived workfl ows.
Figure 6.1

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 271
Contour Flange Tool
The Contour Flange tool is a sketch-based feature (using an open profi le) that has the ability to 
create multiple planar faces and bends as the result of a single feature, as shown in Figure 6.2. 
Profi le sketches should contain only arcs and lines; if sketch intersections are not separated by 
an arc, a bend equal to the BendRadius parameter will automatically be added at the intersec-
tion, as determined by the sheet-metal rule. To create base features with a profi le sketch, contour 
fl anges have a width extent option called Distance, which allows a simple open profi le to be uti-
lized to create a sheet-metal condition extrusion of the thickened, fi lleted profi le.
Figure 6.2
Contour Flange 
base feature
You can use the Contour Flange tool to create sheet-metal base features; in fact, it is often the 
fastest way to create them. Although you could create the part shown in Figure 6.2 by using the 
Face tool and then adding fl anges, it would be more time-consuming. Using the Contour Flange 
tool has one drawback, however: Since you are combining many features, you lose some fl exibil-
ity for revising the shape.
Follow these steps to explore the basics of creating a base feature with the Contour 
Flange tool:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le named mi_6a_001.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder. If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 6 fi les from 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” 
section of the introduction for the download and setup instructions. 
 
3. Select the Contour Flange tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. For the Profi le selection, click anywhere along the sketch profi le.
Depending on where you clicked on the sketch, the preview will show either the outside 
or inside of the sketch. Also notice that the corners at each end of the 25 mm leg are auto-
matically rounded even though no radius was specifi ed in the sketch. This is because of 
the predefi ned BendRadius parameter.
 
5. Use the Flip Side buttons (three arrow buttons) to change the preview so you can see how 
each changes the result. Then set the side so that the preview is to the inside of the sketch 
profi le (as in Figure 6.2) and therefore holding the overall dimensions of the sketch.

272 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
 
6. Enter 6 mm in the Bend Radius input box, and notice that the corners at each end of the 
25 mm leg are updated.
Entering a value in the Bend Radius input box overrides the predefi ned BendRadius 
parameter and sets this contour fl ange feature to always use 6 mm. If the part were set to 
use another predefi ned style, bends in this feature would not update to follow the style 
but would instead stay at 6 mm.
 
7. Click the >> button to expand the Contour Flange dialog box (if it isn’t already expanded) 
and then set the Distance input box to 150 mm.
 
8. Use the ViewCube® to change the view so you can see the direction of the contour.
 
9. Click the Distance Mid-Plane button so the part is created equally to both sides of the 
sketch.
 
10. Click the OK button to create the feature.
In the preceding steps you created a base feature using an open profi le sketch and the 
Contour Flange tool. From this point, you could begin adding secondary features as required. 
For now, though, you can close this fi le without saving changes and continue looking at other 
tools used to create base features.
Contour Roll Tool
The Contour Roll tool is a variation of the Contour Flange tool. To create a contour roll, you 
sketch an open profi le, but you revolve it instead of extruding it. Sketch geometry is limited to 
lines and arcs, and the Contour Roll tool will automatically add a bend at line intersections. The 
rolled hat fl ange in Figure 6.3 was created using the simple sketch geometry shown.
Figure 6.3
Contour Roll base 
feature
Follow these steps to explore the basics of creating a base feature with the Contour Roll tool:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_002.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Contour Roll tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Set the Unroll Method drop-down box to Centroid Cylinder if it is not already. For the 
Profi le selection, click anywhere along the sketch profi le.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 273
 
5. Select the centerline for the Axis selection.
Note the options in the Unroll Method drop-down box:
Centroid Cylinder  The neutral cylindrical surface is derived by the centroid location 
of the profi le, based on the selected axis. The neutral radius and unrolled length are 
displayed.
Custom Cylinder  This allows you to select a sketched line to defi ne the cylindrical neu-
tral surface. The unrolled length is displayed.
Developed Length  This allows you to enter the developed length and displays the ad-
justed neutral radius.
Neutral Radius  This allows you to enter the neutral radius and displays the adjusted 
unrolled length.
These options all derive the developed length by multiplying the rolled angle by a neutral 
radius but differ from one another by the type of input specifi ed.
 
6. Set the unroll method to Custom Cylinder and select the sketch line denoted as Custom 
Neutral Axis for the Neutral Axis selection. Note the displayed unrolled length.
 
7. Set the unroll method to Neutral Radius and enter 60 mm in the input box. You’ll notice 
that the displayed unrolled length adjusts based on the change.
 
8. Set the unroll method to Developed Length and enter 100 mm in the input box. You’ll 
notice that the displayed neutral radius adjusts based on the change.
 
9. Click the OK button to create the feature.
 
10. Click the Create Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
11. Right-click the Flat Pattern node in the browser and choose Extents. You’ll see that the 
width of the fl at pattern has been held to 100 mm, honoring your fi nal input value.
 
12. Click the Close button in the Flat Pattern Extents dialog box and then deselect the Flat 
Pattern node in the browser (you can do so by clicking on-screen anywhere in the graph-
ics area).
 
13. Click the Go To Folded Part button on the Sheet Metal tab to return to the folded model.
In the preceding steps you created a base feature using an open profi le sketch and the Contour 
Roll tool. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue looking at other tools used 
to create base features. Before continuing, though, you can open the fi le mi_6a_003.ipt to create 
a secondary contour roll feature based on the fi rst.
Lofted Flange Tool
The Lofted Flange tool creates sheet-metal shapes typically seen in HVAC transitions and material-
handling hoppers. Figure 6.4 shows a square-to-round transition. Basically, you create sketches of 
the beginning and end of the transition and then use the Lofted Flange tool to transition between 
the two. The Lofted Flange tool gives you the option of a die form or a press brake transition. For 
press brake transitions, you can defi ne the bends by chord tolerance, facet angle, or facet distance. 
The chord tolerance is the distance between the angled face and the theoretical curved surface. As 
the chord tolerance is decreased, more facets are added.

274 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Figure 6.4
Square-to-round 
lofted ﬂ ange
To create a lofted fl ange, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_004.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Click the Lofted Flange button in the Create panel.
 
4. Select the square and the circle for the profi le selections.
 
5. In the output area of the dialog box, click the Die Formed button, and note that the pre-
view changes to remove the press brake facets and that the facet controls in the dialog 
box are hidden.
 
6. Click the Press Brake button and use the Facet Control drop-down to experiment with 
the Chord Tolerance, Facet Angle, and Facet Distance options to familiarize yourself with 
their behavior.
Chord Tolerance  This value sets the maximum separation distance from the arc seg-
ment to the chord segment.
Facet Angle  This value sets the maximum angle to the chord segment at the facet face 
vertex.
Facet Distance  This value sets the maximum width of the length of the chord.
Converge  This check box sets the bends of the fl attened faceted sections to converge 
near a singular point.
Deciding which of these options to use depends largely on the design inputs you know 
and the equipment to be used to create the part on the shop fl oor.
 
7. Ensure that the Converge check box is not selected, set the Facet Control drop-down to 
Facet Distance, and change the distance to 50 mm.
Note that there is a glyph icon at each of the transition corners on the model preview. If you 
hover your cursor over them, you can see them better. Clicking one of these Bend Zone Edit 

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 275
glyphs displays a dialog box to change the facet control and also displays individual glyphs 
for each bend. The Bend Zone Edit dialog box enables you to change the facet control for 
the corner corresponding to the glyph you clicked, as shown in Figure 6.5. Clicking one 
of the bend glyphs displays a Bend Zone Edit dialog box that enables you to override the 
bend radius and unfold rule for an individual bend.
Figure 6.5

dialog box
Continuing with the previous steps, investigate the use of Bend Zone Edit glyphs for 
yourself with these steps:
 
8. Click one of the Bend Zone Edit glyphs.
 
9. Click the check box in the Bend Zone Edit dialog box and select Number Of Facets.
 
10. Enter 2 in the edit fi eld and note that the preview updates.
 
11. Click one of the Bend Edit glyphs and then click the Bend Radius check box in the result-
ing Bend Edit dialog box.
 
12. Change the bend radius to BendRadius*10 and note the preview.
 
13. Click the OK button and note that the Bend Edit glyph has changed. A pencil is added to 
indicate that it has been overridden.
 
14. Click the OK button in the Bend Zone Edit dialog box. Hover your cursor over the glyph 
and note that a pencil has been added to it as well.
 
15. Click the OK button in the Lofted Flange dialog box to create the feature.
 
16. Click the Create Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab. Note that the part isn’t fl at-
tened because it is a continuous piece.
 
17. Click the Go To Folded Part button on the Sheet Metal tab to return to the folded model.
To get the lofted fl ange transition to fl atten, you’ll need to create a rip feature in one of the 
faces. The Rip tool will be discussed in the section “Adding, Removing, or Deforming Material” 
later in this chapter. For now, you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to the 
next section to explore the creation of fl anges.

276 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Creating Secondary Flange Features
Once a base feature is created, you can add secondary features in the form of fl anges. Flanges are 
planar faces connected by a bend and can be created using a number of tools. The Flange tool auto-
matically creates bends between the fl anges and the selected faces. You can also use the Contour 
Flange tool to create several fl anges at once. The Hem tool allows you to create specialized fl anges 
to hem sharp edges or to create rolled fl ange features. Another tool commonly used along with 
these tools is the Face tool. Depending on the selected tool, you can either control fl ange options or 
allow Inventor to apply predefi ned relationships and values.
Flange Tool
The Flange tool creates a single planar face and bend for each edge selected, with controls for 
defi ning the fl ange height, bend position, and relief options at the edge intersections. For fl anges 
referencing a single edge, width extent options are also available by clicking the >> button in 
the Flange dialog box. If multiple edges have been selected for fl ange locations, corner seams are 
automatically added, as shown in Figure 6.6. The bend and corner seam dimensions follow the 
sheet-metal rule unless a value is entered to override them per that particular feature. The pre-
view displays glyphs at each bend and corner seam. If you click a glyph, a dialog box appears so 
you can override the values.

To explore the Flange tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_005.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Flange tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Currently the Edge Select Mode button (on the left side of the Edges selection box) is 
selected, allowing you to select only one edge at a time. Click the Loop Select Mode but-
ton so you can select multiple edges at once.

5. Place your cursor over the top face of the hexagonal-shaped base feature. Click the edge 
when you see all six edges highlight. Note that if you chose the bottom edge rather than 
the top, you can use the Flip Direction button to change the direction.
 
6. Click the Edge Select Mode button and then hold the Ctrl key and click one of the cur-
rently selected edges to deselect it. The Edges selection box will indicate that you now 
have only fi ve selected.
 
7. Set the fl ange height to 100 mm.
 
8. Set the fl ange angle to 60.
 
9. Click the Corner tab, uncheck the Apply Auto-Mitering check box to observe the preview 
change, and then reselect the check box to allow the fl anges to fl are out into the mitered 
corners.
 
10. In the Miter Gap input box, enter 1 mm to reduce the gap size from the current default 
value (the GapSize parameter is currently set at 3 mm in the sheet-metal rule).
 
11. Click the Apply button to create the fi ve fl anges and leave the Flange dialog box open 
(recall that clicking the OK button creates the feature and closes the dialog box, and click-
ing Apply creates the feature but does not close the dialog box).
 
12. Click the Shape tab and ensure that the Edge Select Mode button is selected.
 
13. Click the edge that you removed from the previous selection set. Note that if you chose 
the bottom edge rather than the top, you can use the Flip Direction button to change the 
direction.
 
14. Set Flange Angle to 90.
 
15. Set the Height Extents drop-down box to To and then click the topmost corner vertex of 
any of the existing fl anges. Figure 6.7 shows the To point being selected.

16. Click the OK button to create the fl ange.

278 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
If you click the front plane on the ViewCube, you can see that all the fl anges terminate in the 
same plane. Keep this in mind as you create fl anges of varying angles. You will explore the tools 
used to close the remaining gaps in this fl ange combination later in this chapter, when looking 
at the Corner Seam tool, but for now you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue 
to explore the Flange tool.
Control Flange Widths
In this next set of steps, you’ll create fl anges of varying widths by adjusting the extents options.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_006.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Flange tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select the top edge of the yellow face to place a fl ange along the edge.
 
5. Set the fl ange height to 50 mm and leave the angle at 90 degrees.
Note that currently the fl ange runs along the extents of the edge. If you imagine the fl at pat-
tern that would result from adding this fl ange, you’ll understand that creating this fl ange 
would create a confl ict at the inside corner. Although Inventor will not prevent you from 
creating the fl ange as is, it will issue an error to the fl at pattern. To resolve this, you will set 
the fl ange width and an offset to hold it back from the corner. There are four possible Width 
Extents settings:
Edge  Runs the fl ange the length of the selected edge
Width  Allows you to specify the width of the fl ange and position it centered on the 
selected edge or offset from a selected reference point
Offset  Allows you to specify offsets from both ends of the selected edge
From To  Allows you to specify a start and end reference to establish the fl ange width
In the real world, the option you use will depend on the result you are trying to achieve 
and the available existing geometry. Here, you’ll use the Width option.
 
6. Click the >> button to expand the Flange dialog box.
 
7. Change Width Extents Type to Width.
 
8. Enter 96 mm in the Width input box.
 
9. Switch the option from Centered to Offset.
 
10. Enter 0 mm for the offset value.
 
11. Click the end of the selected edge farthest from the green face to establish the offset 
point. Use the Offset Flip button to redirect the fl ange if needed.
 
12. Click the OK button to create the fl ange.
 
13. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab to have a look at the resulting 
fl at pattern.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 279
Although the fl ange width options are easy to overlook because they are initially hidden in 
the More Options area of the dialog box, you should keep them in mind as you create fl anges. 
For now, you can close this fi le without saving changes. Here are more options to be aware of 
when creating fl anges:
Flange Height Datum  There are three Height Datum solutions available. These options 
control which faces are used to determine the height measurement. In Figure 6.8, each of the 
options is shown using a 40 mm fl ange.
Figure 6.8
Flange height 
datum solutions
Bend From The Intersection Of The Two Outer Faces  Measures the fl ange height from 
the intersection of the outer faces, as shown on the left in Figure 6.8
Bend From The Intersection Of The Two Inner Faces  Measures the fl ange height from 
the intersection of the inner faces, as shown in the center in Figure 6.8
Parallel To The Flange Termination Detail Face  Measures the fl ange height parallel to 
the fl ange face and tangent to the bend, as shown on the right in Figure 6.8
Orthogonal and Aligned Flanges  You can use the Aligned VS Orthogonal toggle button to 
determine whether the height measurement is aligned with the fl ange face or orthogonal 
to the base face. In Figure 6.9, the fl ange on the left is orthogonal, and the measurement on 
the right is aligned.
Figure 6.9
Orthogonal and 
aligned ﬂ anges
Bend Position  There are four options to select from to determine the bend position relative 
to the face of the selected edge. Figure 6.10 compares the four options, with the dashed line 
representing the selected edge of the base feature.

Inside Of Base Face Extents  Positions the fl ange so that it honors the overall dimension 
of the selected base part, as shown on the far left of Figure 6.10
Bend From Adjacent Face  Holds the face of the selected edge as the start of the bend, as 
shown on the center left of Figure 6.10
Outside Of Base Face Extents  Positions the inside face of the fl ange so that it remains 
outside of the face of the selected edge, as shown on the center right of Figure 6.10
Bend Tangent To Side Face  Holds the bend tangent to the face of the selected edge, as 
shown on the far right of Figure 6.10
Old Method  When checked, this option disables the functionality introduced in the 
Autodesk® Inventor® 2008 program. If you open a fi le created in an older version, the features 
will likely have this option selected. You can uncheck the box to update the fi le to use all the 
available options. There is no reason to check this box on parts that you create with the cur-
rent version of Inventor.
Bend and Corner Edit Glyphs  Although you will often create fl anges along multiple edges 
as a single fl ange feature, you can still control the bend and corner options individually by 
using the edit glyphs displayed on the features in the graphics area. You can access the edit 
glyphs by expanding the Flange node in the browser and then right-clicking the bend or corner 
and choosing Edit Bend or Edit Corner. Once they are displayed, you can click the edit glyph 
for the bend or corner you want to edit and make changes on an individual basis. You can click 
the edit glyphs during the creation of fl anges as well. Once bends or corners are edited, they 
can be reset to the defaults by expanding the Flange node in the browser, right-clicking the 
bend or corner, and choosing Reset All Bends/Corners.
Contour Flange Tool
In addition to creating base features as explored previously, the Contour Flange tool can be used 
to add fl anges to an existing feature. Since the Contour Flange tool uses open profi le sketches, 
it is ideal for quickly creating complex shapes and enclosure designs. As discussed earlier, the 
Contour Flange tool can either automatically bend line intersections or use sketched arcs for 
bends. A contour fl ange automatically creates a bend between itself and a selected edge on an 
existing face. The sketch profi le for the Contour Flange tool does not need to be coincident with 
the edge; it simply needs to be sketched on a plane that is perpendicular to it. If the sketch pro-
fi le is coincident with an edge, a bend will automatically be positioned to connect the sketch 
profi le to the face. If the sketch is not coincident with a reference edge and the width extent 
option is changed to Distance, the result will be a contour fl ange that isn’t attached to the part.
Just as with the Flange feature, automatic mitering of adjacent fl anges and the placement of 
corner reliefs occur when multiple edges are selected, as shown in Figure 6.11.
To explore the Contour Flange tool a bit more, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_007.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Contour Flange tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.

4. Select the visible sketch profi le as the Profi le selection.
 
5. Select one of the edges (top or bottom) that have the two work planes running through it.
You’ll note that you cannot add any more edges to the selection. This is because the 
sketch is disconnected from the base feature and therefore can be used only to create 
a fl ange along the one edge. Next, you’ll use the work planes to defi ne the width of the 
fl ange. 
 
6. Click the >> button to expand the dialog box and reveal the Width Extents options.
 
7. Set the Type drop-down box to From To.
 
8. Select the two visible work planes as the From and To selections.
 
9. In the Bend Extensions area, click the left button (Extend Bend Aligned To Side Faces).
 
10. Click the OK button to create the contour fl ange.
You should notice that the fl ange width starts and stops at the work planes selected for 
the width extents. You’ll also notice that the edge of the base feature extends to meet the 
fl ange. This is because of the Bend Extension option. The Bend Extension options are as 
follows:
Extend Bend Aligned To Side Faces  Extends the base feature to meet the fl ange.
Extend Bend Perpendicular To Side Faces  Extends the fl ange to meet the base feature. 
This is the default.
You’ll explore these options a bit more in the upcoming pages, but for now you’ll edit the 
fl ange and toggle this option to compare the results.
 
11. Right-click the Contour Flange feature in the browser and choose Edit Feature.
 
12. In the Bend Extensions area, click the right button (Extend Bend Perpendicular To Side 
Faces).
 
13. Click the OK button, and note that the fl ange has now extended to the base feature, as 
shown on the right of Figure 6.12.

18. Notice the automatic mitering of the corners; if this was not the desired result, you could 
disable the Apply Auto-Mitering check box option on the Corner tab. 
 
19. Click the OK button to create the fl anges. 
As you can see, the Contour Flange tool can be used to quickly create multiple bend fl anges 
from a basic open profi le sketch. This is often the quickest way to create even simple fl anges 
when they are the same on all edges of a base feature, particularly when the fl anges require 
a miter fi t. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section to 
explore hems.
Hem Tool
The Hem tool is like a contour fl ange because it has the ability to create multiple planar faces 
and bends for a selected edge, but it is restricted to predefi ned common hem profi les and geo-
metric relationships.
To explore the different hem fl ange types and options, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_008.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
In this fi le, each of the four hem types has been created on one side of the part. You can 
use the cutouts on the other side to create a hem matching each of the ones on the left. 
Once you have experimented with the hem types using the cutouts, proceed to create a 
hem on the edge of the yellow face.
 
3. Use the ViewCube to fi nd a view of the yellow interior face.

6. Select the edge along the outside of the yellow face.
 
7. Set Gap to 2 mm.
 
8. Set Length to 12 mm.
 
9. Click the >> button to expand the dialog box.
 
10. Change Width Extents Type to Offset.
 
11. Use the appropriate offset input box to set the end that will interfere with the existing 
hem to 5 mm.
 
12. Set the other offset to 0 mm so that no offset is created.
 
13. Click the OK button to create the Hem fl ange.
Although the Hem tools are fairly straightforward, it is often the use of offsets that allows 
you to place hems as needed. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the 
next section.
Face Tool
The last feature capable of creating fl anges is the Face tool. The Face tool uses a closed profi le 
sketch, and it can automatically create an attaching bend on a selected edge. This automatic 
edge creation is powerful because it allows you to create a skeletal surface model of your design, 
project the planar surfaces into sketches, and create face features with attached bends. The 
manual controls can be utilized to connect face features to preexisting geometry, create double 
bends (joggles), or even deselect edges that have been automatically inferred because they share 
a common edge.
You can also use the Face tool to create models from 2D fl at patterns that were created in 
another application, such as Autodesk® AutoCAD®. When the 2D fl at pattern is imported, the 
Face tool can be used to thicken it to the desired value. A fl at pattern can be produced for a pla-
nar face (no unfolding needs to actually occur), which enables a variety of uses.
In the following steps, you’ll derive a frame into your sheet-metal part and use it as a refer-
ence to create a face. You’ll then create another face and use the built-in Bend tools to connect 
them.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_009.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Manage tab and click the Derive button on the Insert panel.
 
4. Open the fi le mi_6a_888.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
5. In the Derived Part dialog box, select the Body As Work Surface button at the top. This 
brings the frame in as a surface that can be turned off later.

6. Click the OK button to create the frame surface.
 
7. Expand the mi_6a_888 node in the browser and right-click the Frame:mi_6a_888.ipt node.
 
8. From the context menu, deselect the Translucent option. This will make the frame edges 
easier to see.
 
9. Right-click the face of the frame side with the triangular corner gussets and choose New 
Sketch to create a 2D sketch on the side of the frame.
 
10. Click the Project Geometry drop-down menu and select Project Cut Edges. This will proj-
ect the face of the frame into the sketch. Alternatively, you can use the Project Geometry 
tool and select the four outer edges and the eight holes.
 
11. Once the projected edges are created, click the Finish Sketch button to return to the Sheet 
Metal tab.
 
12. From the Sheet Metal tab, select the Face button.
 
13. Choose the sketch boundary (or boundaries) so that the entire side of the frame, minus 
the holes, is selected.
 
14. Ensure that the face is not going into the frame, use the Offset button if the direction 
needs to be adjusted, and then click the OK button to create the face feature with holes. 
Figure 6.13 shows the frame and face.

15. Locate the sketch called Flange Sketch in the browser and then right-click it and choose 
Visibility from the context menu. This sketch was prepared in the sheet-metal fi le ahead 
of time for this tutorial, but in the real world you would create it by referencing the frame 
as you did for the fi rst face feature.
 
16. On the Sheet Metal tab, select the Face tool again and choose the rectangular profi le 
minus the slots as the Profi le selection.

17. Use the Offset button to ensure that the face is coming out away from the frame.
 
18. Click the Edges button in the Bend area of the dialog box and then select the left vertical 
edge of the fi rst face feature. This will create a bend connecting to two faces.
 
19. Click the OK button to create the new face with the bend feature.
If you examine the slotted fl ange face, you might notice that it does not rest on the face of the 
frame. This is because the premade sketch that you made visible was created on a work plane 
at 302 mm from the center of the 600 mm–wide frame. Using the offset work plane, a 2 mm gap 
was created, allowing space for the bend radius, insert studs, and spacer hardware that might be 
required.
Be aware that when you have fi nished with a derived work surface (the frame in this case), 
you can right-click it in the browser and toggle off the visibility. This leaves only the sheet-metal 
part showing. To create the next sheet-metal part of the frame, such as the front or back cover-
ing, you would create a new sheet-metal part and derive the frame again. Once all of the parts 
are complete, you can place them into an assembly fi le knowing that they will all fi t around the 
frame they were based on. For now, though, you can close this fi le without saving changes and 
continue to the next section.
Adding, Removing, or Deforming Material
Once the general shape of a sheet-metal component is roughed in, in most cases material will 
need to be removed, deformed, or added. Several sheet-metal-specifi c features have been cre-
ated to optimize the process of adding, removing, and deforming sheet-metal parts because 
most sheet-metal-manufacturing operations (punch presses, for example) create features per-
pendicular to the surface. The current capabilities of Inventor assume that these manufacturing 
operations are done in the fl at prior to folding and therefore should not interfere with unfold-
ing (Inventor does not support post-folding manufacturing operations such as gussets, for 
example).
Cut Tool
The Cut tool is a special sheet-metal extrude. It creates a hole based on a sketched profi le. The 
Cut tool helps simplify the options of the regular Extrude tool because the distance parameter 
defaults to Thickness, and therefore cut features automatically update if the sheet-metal part is 
changed to use a different material thickness. If a cut is not intended to be the full depth of the 
material thickness, you can enter an equation based on the thickness value, such as Thickness/2 
to create half-thickness cuts.
Creating Cuts Across Sheet Metal Bends
The Cut tool can also wrap the sketch profi le across planar faces and bends, as shown in 
Figure 6.14. This option is particularly helpful because it allows you to force a uniform cut 
across multiple planar faces and bends with a value greater than zero and equal to or less than 
Thickness.

Using Cuts
With sheet-metal parts, it is often best to create your base features and ﬂ anges and then apply the 
cuts as required. You will ﬁ nd that this provides a more stable model when creating a ﬂ at pattern 
and allows you to edit features individually. It’s generally best practice to use the Cut tool whenever 
possible rather than creating voids in the base sketch.
To explore the options of the Cut tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_010.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. In the browser ensure that the view representation named Top Slot View is active. If it is 
not, simply expand the View browser node and double-click the Top Slot View node.
 
4. Select the Cut tool from the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
5. Click the OK button to create the cut feature. Note how the cut remains only in the top 
plane and is not accurate for a slot that would be cut in the fl at pattern.
 
6. Right-click the cut feature in the browser and choose Edit Feature.
 
7. Select the Cut Across Bend check box, note the preview, and then click the OK button 
to create the cut feature. You’ll notice that it cuts through the part and across the 
existing bends.
 
8. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab to examine the slot cut in the 
fl at pattern. You’ll notice that the cut edges are normal to the fl at sheet as expected.
 
9. Click the Go To Folded Part button on the Sheet Metal tab to return to the folded model.
 
10. Edit the cut feature again, enter Thickness/2 in the Distance input box under Extents, and 
then click the OK button.
As you can see, the Cut tool allows you to create partial depth cutouts across bends as 
well. Using the Cut Across Bend option allows cut features to be created in the formed 

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 287
part model that are accurate to the way the cutout is created in the fl at pattern, and then 
bent in the fi nished folded part, just as would be done in the real world. 
You can leave this fi le open and continue to the next exercise to explore the creation of 
angled cuts held normal to the sheet-metal fl at pattern.
Creating Angled Features Cut Normal to the Flat Pattern
To create angled cuts held normal to the sheet-metal fl at pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. If you do not already have fi le mi_6a_010.ipt open, then click the Get Started tab and 
choose Open; then select the fi le mi_6a_010.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. In the browser, ensure that the view representation named Rod View is active. If it is not, 
simply expand the View browser node and double-click the Rod View node.
You’ll see a yellow surface representing a keyed rod that runs through the sheet-metal 
bracket. Your goal is to create a cut feature in the bracket that allows the rod to fi t 
through. 
 
3. Select the Cut tool from the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab. The Profi le shape should 
be automatically selected for you since there is only one visible sketch available (the Rod 
CutOut sketch).
 
4. Set the Extents drop-down box from Distance to All.
 
5. Set the Direction button to go in both directions.
 
6. Click the OK button to create the cut feature. 
 
7. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab to examine the cuts in the fl at 
pattern. You’ll notice that the cut edges have bevels and are not normal to the fl at sheet as 
you would want them to be if the cutouts were to be punched or laser cut.
 
8. Click the Go To Folded Part button on the Sheet Metal tab to return to the folded model.
 
9. Right-click the cut feature in the browser and choose Edit Feature.
 
10. Select the Cut Normal check box and then click the OK button.
 
11. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab again and notice the cuts in the 
fl at pattern no longer have the beveled edges.
These exercises demonstrate the use of the Cut Across Bend and Cut Normal options in the 
Cut tool. As a general rule, you should use the Cut tool to create cutouts in a sheet-metal 
part fi le, rather than the Extrude tool as you would in a standard part fi le. When you’ve 
fi nished exploring the Cut tool, you can close this fi le and continue to the next section.
Punch Tool 
You can use the Punch tool to either remove material or deform it by placing predefi ned Punch 
tool geometry, as shown in Figure 6.15. Punches are special versions of iFeatures; they can be 
predefi ned with additional manufacturing information and can be built using a variety of stan-
dard and sheet-metal features.

To explore the methods and options used to place punch features, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_011.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Click the Punch Tool button on the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. In the Punch Tool dialog box, use the scroll bar in the left window to locate the Chapter 
06 folder.
 
5. Locate and select the fi le Knockout_73x.ide and then click the Open button.
Setting the Sheet-Metal Punch Tool Default Location
By default, Inventor is set to look for the punch library in the install directory on your local drive. 
If you’re working on a network share drive, you will most likely want to point the Punch tool to 
automatically go to a path on the network. To do so, click the Application Options button on the 
Tools tab, select the iFeature tab, and set Sheet Metal Punches Root to the path of your choosing.
 
6. Because this part has two visible sketches, no centers are automatically selected. Select 
any one of the center sketch points on the part.
 
7. Continue selecting center points, and note that you can select only points that share 
the same sketch. Sketch2 contains three sketch points, toward one end of the part, and 
Sketch3 contains fi ve sketch points grouped together at the other end.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 289
Window-Select Multiple Punch Center Points
You can use a crossing window selection to select multiple punch center points at once. A window 
selection from left to right will select only items contained in the window. A window selection 
from right to left will select all items that touch the window or are contained in the window. If you 
window-select an item already selected, it will be removed from the selection set. Note, too, that 
you can hold the Ctrl key and select in empty space to clear the selection set.
 
8. When you have added all of the center points you can (it will be either three or fi ve, 
depending on which sketch the points are in), select the Size tab.
 
9. Enter 35 mm for the diameter value and then click in the space below the Diameter row 
in the dialog box.
 
10. Click the Refresh button to see the diameter update on-screen. Note that if the diameter 
does not update, you probably did not click out of the Diameter row to set the edit. The 
Refresh option is a bit picky in this way. Keep in mind, however, that the punch preview 
does not need to be refreshed to build correctly.
 
11. Click the Finish button to create the punches.
 
12. Right-click and choose Repeat Punch Tool; then, in the Punch Tool dialog box, use the 
scroll bar in the left window to locate the Chapter 06 folder.
 
13. Once again, locate and select the fi le called Knockout_73x.ide; then click the Open 
button.
 
14. You’ll notice that because you have only one visible sketch now, all of the center points in 
the sketch are automatically selected.
 
15. Click the Geometry tab and then click the Centers button.
 
16. Press and hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and then deselect any one of the selected 
center points by clicking it in the sketch. Note that it is often easier to do this when view-
ing the sketch from straight on.
 
17. With all but one of the available center points selected, change Angle to 45 degrees. Note 
that all of the current punches are rotated.
 
18. Click Finish to create the punches.
 
19. Locate the sketch with the unused sketch point in the browser; then right-click it and 
choose Visibility to turn it back on.
 
20. Right-click and choose Repeat PunchTool; then in the Punch Tool dialog box, use the 
scroll bar in the left window to locate the Chapter 06 folder.

290 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
 
21. Locate and select the fi le Knockout_73x.ide and then click the Open button.
 
22. The fi nal center point should be automatically selected. If not, select it and then click 
Finish to create it at the default size and orientation.
You can close this fi le without saving changes, but before moving on to the next topic, take 
a moment to understand how punch placement sketches and punch features work. In the pre-
ceding steps, you explored the options and methods used to place sheet-metal punches on an 
existing sketch. The process of applying a published Punch tool to your sheet-metal design is 
fairly straightforward. When you’re authoring a Punch tool, the fi rst sketch-based feature ref-
erenced to create the Punch tool must contain a single sketched center mark. To place a Punch 
tool, at least one sketched center mark is required in the placement sketch. Creating punch fea-
tures (and regular iFeatures) is covered in Chapter 7, “Reusing Parts and Features.”
Corner Round and Corner Chamfer
Corner Round and Corner Chamfer are special sheet-metal tools that allow you to remove 
or break sharp edges, similar to fi lleting and chamfering. Edge selection has been optimized 
within the two tools, fi ltering out edges that are not normal to the sheet top and bottom faces for 
easy application. To explore the methods and options used to place round and chamfer features, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_012.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Corner Round tool on the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Set the radius to 8 mm and then click the Pencil icon in the Corner Round dialog box to 
change the focus from edit to select.
 
5. Select the two sharp corner edges on the green fl ange and then click the OK button.
 
6. Right-click and choose Repeat Corner Round and then set the Select Mode radio button 
to Feature.
 
7. Select any of the yellow fl anges, and you will see that all of the sharp corners for the fea-
ture called Flange1 are automatically selected.
 
8. Change the radius to 15 mm and then click the OK button to create the rounds.
 
9. Select the Corner Chamfer tool from the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
10. Select the remaining two sharp corners and set the distance to 18 mm. Click the OK but-
ton to create the corners.
As a fi nal step you might want to right-click Flange1 in the browser, choose Properties, and 
set Feature Color Style to As Part. You can do the same to Flange2. When fi nished, you can close 
the fi le without saving the changes and continue to the next section.

Corner Seam Tool
The Corner Seam tool allows you to extend (as shown in Figure 6.16) or trim fl ange faces to 
manage the seam between them and select corner relief options. The Corner Seam dialog box 
contains numerous options for specifying the seam and contains two fundamentally different 
distance defi nition methods: Maximum Gap and Face/Edge. In older versions of Inventor, only 
the Face/Edge method was available for the Corner Seam tool. The Face/Edge method works 
for many situations but also tends to suffer from an inability to maintain a constant seam gap 
between planar faces that do not have an identical input angle. The Maximum Gap method was 
developed from the perspective of a physical inspection gauge, where the nominal value of the 
seam is exactly the value entered at every point, but you just might need to twist the tool as you 
draw it through the seam.

To explore the Corner Seam tool and its options, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_013.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Corner Seam tool on the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select the left edge of the yellow face and either edge of the blue face next to it. In the pre-
view, the red edges represent the material to be removed and the green edges represent 
the material to be added.
 
5. In the Seam area of the Corner Seam dialog box, select the Symmetric Gap option if it’s 
not already selected.
 
6. Set the gap to 1 mm and notice the change to the preview.
 
7. Click the Apply button to create the seam feature.
 
8. Select the right edge of the orange face and either edge of the blue face next to it and then 
click the OK button to create this seam and close the dialog box.

292 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
As you can see, corner seams are useful when you need to close up a corner between two 
seams. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue with the next set of steps to 
explore more of the settings in the Corner Seam tool.
Understanding Corner Seam Gap and Overlap Settings
In these steps, you’ll explore the gap and overlap settings found in the Corner Seam tool:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_014.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Corner Seam tool on the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select the short edge of the orange fl ange nearest the yellow fl ange and the short edge of 
the yellow fl ange nearest the orange fl ange.
 
5. You’ll note that the preview shows that the two fl anges come together in a 45-degree 
miter. Click the Overlap button to see the preview change to extend one of the fl anges so 
it overlaps the other.
 
6. Click the Reverse Overlap button to see the opposite overlap in the preview.
 
7. Click the Apply button to create the seam.
 
8. Click a short edge of the yellow fl ange nearest the blue fl ange and a short edge of the blue 
fl ange nearest the yellow fl ange.
 
9. Set the Seam option to Maximum Gap Distance (if it is not already) and click the 
Symmetric Gap button.
 
10. Click the OK button to create the corner seam and then click the top face on the 
ViewCube to observe the corner of the yellow and blue fl anges. Note that it may be help-
ful to zoom up on the corner.
If you measure the gap distance at the inside vertices between the two fl anges, it will be 
3 mm, which is what the Gap parameter is set to, as shown on the left of Figure 6.17.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 293
 
11. Edit the corner feature you just created, switch the radio button to Face/Edge Distance, 
and then click the OK button.
Now the Gap parameter holds the distance between the face and edge of the two fl anges, 
as shown on the right of Figure 6.17.
 
12. Edit the corner feature again, and this time click the Overlap button.
 
13. Enter 0.5 in the Percent Overlap input box and then click the OK button.
You will see that the yellow fl ange overlaps the edge of the blue fl ange exactly halfway, 
or 50 percent. You can specify the overlap as a percentage of the fl ange thickness using a 
decimal value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. For instance, 1.0 equals 100 percent, 0.5 equals 50 
percent, and so on.
 
14. Edit the corner feature once again and click the Reverse Overlap button.
 
15. Enter 1.0 in the Percent Overlap input box and then click the OK button.
You will see that the blue fl ange now overlaps the yellow fl ange completely, or the full 100 
percent. Figure 6.18 shows a comparison of overlap values with the same gap setting of 3 mm. 
On the left the overlap is set to 1.0, or 100 percent of the 3 mm gap. In the middle the overlap is 
set to 0.5, or 50 percent of the 3 mm gap. And on the right the overlap is set to 0.0, or 0 percent of 
the 3 mm gap.

In the previous steps you explored the gap and overlap settings of the Corner Seam tool. You 
can close this fi le without saving changes and continue with the next set of steps to explore one 
more set of options in the Corner Seam tool.
Understanding Corner Seam Extend Options
In the following steps, you will look at the options for controlling the way fl anges are extended 
when their edges are not perpendicular:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_015.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Corner Seam tool on the Modify panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select the shorter edge of the blue fl ange and the closest edge of the yellow fl ange.
 
5. Click the >> button in the Corner Seam dialog box and set the Extend Corner option to 
Perpendicular; then click the Apply button.
 
6. Select the taller edge of the blue fl ange and the closest edge of the orange fl ange.

294 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
 
7. Click the >> button in the Corner Seam dialog box again (if needed) and toggle the 
Extend Corner option between Perpendicular and Aligned to see the difference.
 
8. Set the Extend Corner option to Perpendicular and click the OK button.
Figure 6.19 shows a comparison of the Perpendicular and Aligned extend options. In the 
image on the right, the frontmost fl ange uses the Aligned solution and the other uses the 
Perpendicular solution.

As you can see, becoming familiar with all the settings in the Corner Seam tool can make 
you aware of a great number of combinations and in the end provide the exact corner you are 
trying to achieve. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue on to explore the 
Fold tool.
Fold Tool
The Fold tool enables you to design a fl ange with a unique profi le by allowing you to sketch the 
position of the bend centerline on a planar face and then fold the part using the sketch line, as 
shown in Figure 6.20.
Figure 6.20
Th e Fold tool 
being applied to a 
face with a spline 
contour
This tool is a sketch consumption feature and contains numerous controls for specifying 
exactly how a planar face should be manipulated into two planar faces connected by a bend. The 
sketch bend centerline must be coincident with the face extents, requiring you to project edges 
and constrain the sketch. When utilizing the Fold tool, remember that the feature works from 

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 295
the opposite design perspective of other sheet-metal features, where bend allowance is actually 
consumed, not added to the resulting folded feature. The Fold tool can be combined with the 
Face tool to help import preexisting 2D fl at patterns and then deform them into their fi nal shape.
To explore the Fold tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_016.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Fold tool on the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab. (Be aware that there is an 
Unfold button and a Refold button as well. You will explore those in the coming pages, 
but for now ensure that you select the Fold tool.)
 
4. Select the visible sketch line on the circular feature for the Bend Line selection.
 
5. Use the Flip Side and Flip Direction buttons to set the preview arrows so that they are 
going up and out from the center of the part.
 
6. Set Fold Angle to 45 (degrees) and Bend Radius to 16 mm.
 
7. Use the Fold Location buttons to set the fold so that it does not include the cutout.
 
8. Click the OK button to create the folded feature.
 
9. To reuse the sketch containing the bend lines, you’ll need to make it visible again. To do 
so, expand the Fold feature in the browser, right-click the sketch, and choose Visibility 
from the context menu.
 
10. Create a fold for each of the remaining lines, setting Fold Angle to 90, Bend Radius to 
2 mm, and Fold Location to Centerline Ff Bend. Use the fl ip controls to set the folds so 
they are all going up and out from the center of the part.
Although not the most commonly used of the sheet-metal tools, the Fold tool can be useful in 
some circumstances. If you happen to have a lot of fl at pattern drawings done in AutoCAD, for 
instance, you can use the Fold tool to convert them to folded models. You can close this fi le with-
out saving changes and continue on to explore the Bend tool in the next section.
Bend Tool
The Bend tool allows you to connect two planar faces by selecting a pair of parallel edges. Since 
Inventor allows the modeling of multiple disconnected faces, the Bend tool can add either a 
single bend or a double bend, depending on the number of selections you make. For design situ-
ations in which multiple disconnected faces have been produced, the Bend tool is often used to 
combine the faces into a single body.
There are four possible double-bend results, depending on the orientation of the edges and 
selected option. If the sheet-metal edges face the same direction, the tool creates either a full 
round bend or two bends connected with a face. If the sheet-metal edges face in opposite direc-
tions, a joggle is created with either two 45-degree bends and one edge fi xed or both edges fi xed 
and the angle calculated. In both cases, the faces will be extended or trimmed as necessary to 
create the bends.

296 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Exploring Bend Options
The following example demonstrates the various ways in which double bends can be created:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_017.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Bend tool from the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select an edge along each of the yellow faces for the Edges selection. Note that the Full 
Radius and 90 Degree Double Bend controls are enabled.
 
5. Set the Double Bend option to Full Radius.
 
6. Toggle the Flip Fixed Edge button and note how the preview updates. Then set it so that 
the upper face is the fi xed edge (the preview will display partially into the lower face).
 
7. Click the Apply button to create the Bend feature.
 
8. Select an edge along each of the orange faces for the Edges selection.
 
9. Set the Double Bend option to 90 Degree.
 
10. Set the Flip Fixed Edge button so that the lower face is the fi xed edge and the bend pre-
views on the outermost edge.
 
11. Click the OK button to create the Bend feature, and note how the lower face width is car-
ried through to the upper face.
 
12. Right-click the Bend feature you just created in the browser and choose Edit Feature.
 
13. Click the Extend Bend Aligned To Side Faces button in the Bend Extension area and then 
click the OK button. Notice how the upper face width is now carried through to the bend.
 
14. Select the Bend tool again, choose the edge of the blue face on the small feature with two 
holes, and then select the edge of the blue face on the large base feature (indicated with 
the arrow). Keep in mind that the selection order is important for this step. When you 
have the correct order, the preview should show the upper feature being extended down 
into the lower base feature.
 
15. Set the bend radius to 18 mm and then click the OK button.
 
16. Right-click the Bend feature you just created in the browser and choose Edit Feature.
 
17. Change the Double Bend option to Fix Edges and then click the OK button.
Although this fi le showcases the available options of the Bend tool, you would not typically 
create faces that just fl oat in space above or below one another. Instead, these tools are often 
used to create bends on faces that are modeled to fi t around other existing parts, most often by 
projecting edges in from an assembly fi le. You can close this fi le without saving changes and 
take a look at the next steps to see the Bend tool used in a more realistic manner.

Using the Bend Tool to Create an Enclosure
In the following steps, you will mirror an existing side of an enclosure around the centerline of a 
derived frame and then use the Bend tool to join the two halves:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_018.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of the Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Click the Mirror button on the Pattern panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Select the features called Right_Side_Face, Front_Flange, and Back_Flange from the 
browser for the Features selection.
 
5. Click the Mirror Plane button in the Mirror dialog box and then choose the visible YZ 
plane. Recall that you must select work planes by clicking their edges in the graphics area 
or by selecting them from the browser.
 
6. Click the OK button to create the mirror feature.
 
7. Select the Bend tool on the Create panel of the Sheet Metal tab.
 
8. Select the top edges of the original and the mirrored faces, leave the Double Bend option 
set to 90 Degree, and note the preview of the bend connecting the two faces.
 
9. Click the OK button to create the bend feature. Figure 6.21 shows the two sides being con-
nected with the Bend tool.
Figure 6.21
Creating a bend to 
connect the sides 
of an enclosure
In the previous steps, not only have you created bends, but you have essentially defi ned the 
entire top face of the enclosure with the Bend tool. Using the Bend tool to connect faces in this 
manner can be a quick way to use geometry projected in from an assembly or a derived work 
surface. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue on to the next section to 
explore the Rip tool.

298 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Rip Tool
The Rip tool creates a gap in a sheet-metal part. A common workfl ow is to create a transition 
with the Lofted Flange tool and then add a Rip feature so it can be fl attened. The Rip tool cre-
ates a gap that is cut normal to the selected face. The Rip tool interface is optimized to create a 
simple gap with minimal inputs.
Inventor has three options for creating a rip, as follows:
Single Point  If the corner of a face is selected as the single point, the rip will follow 
the edge. If a sketch point located on an edge is selected, the rip will be perpendicular 
to the edge.
Point To Point  For Point To Point, a linear rip is created between the two points.
Face Extents  For face selection, all edges of the face are ripped.
Follow these steps to create a simple Rip feature on a square-to-round transition:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_019.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Click the Rip button in the Modify panel on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. Set the Rip Type drop-down box to Point To Point.
 
5. Select the yellow face for the Rip Face selection.
 
6. Select the midpoint of the arc along the top of the yellow face and the midpoint of the arc 
along the bottom of the yellow face for the Start Point and End Point selections.
 
7. Click the OK button to create the Rip feature. Figure 6.22 shows the Rip tool selections.
Figure 6.22

on a square-to-
round transition
Creating Rip features allows you to open up a part for unfolding in a quick and easy manner. 
Keep in mind that you can use an extruded cut to do this as well. In most cases, though, the Rip 
tool will be the best tool to use. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue on 
to the next section to explore the Unfold and Refold tools.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 299
Unfold and Refold Tool
The Unfold and Refold tools are a powerful tool combination that allows you to unfold and then 
refold the model. There are several reasons to do this:
 
◆
To add features in the unfolded state
 
◆
To refold the model in bend order to see the manufacturing stages of the part
 
◆
To change the orientation of the folded model in space
One of the limitations in early versions of Inventor was that you couldn’t fold a deformation. 
Using Unfold or Refold, you can add a deformation that crosses the bend zone and then refold it. 
Since the deformation is simply calculated around the bend, there can be distortion issues when 
the deformation is large with respect to the bend radius. For best results, limit the deformation 
to the material thickness. For larger deformations, make sure the fi nal results match what would 
be created in the shop.
Another aspect of the Unfold and Refold tools involves bend order. Many sheet-metal parts 
are complex, with several bend-order possibilities. Using Unfold or Refold allows you to experi-
ment with bend order so you can determine the best way to manufacture the part.
Changing the orientation of the folded model allows for some interesting workfl ows. When 
you unfold a model, you select a face that remains stationary. When you refold the model, you 
also have to select the stationary face. If you select a different stationary face for the refold than 
you did for the unfold, the model will have a different orientation when you have fi nished.
Unfolded vs. Flat Pattern
Th e ﬂ at pattern is a separate model object that shows the completely ﬂ attened part for documenta-
tion. Th e ﬂ at pattern also contains manufacturing information such as bend direction. Unfold and 
Refold features can’t be directly accessed in the drawing, so you can’t have views showing diﬀ er-
ent states of the same model. To show intermediate fold states in a drawing, use derived parts or 
an iPart to create models with refold features suppressed and then create views of those models.
Unfolding and Refolding Sheet-Metal Parts
The Unfold/Refold process is straightforward. The selections have fi lters for the correct geom-
etry, so you are not required to focus on a small target. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_020.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Click the Unfold button in the Modify panel.
 
4. Select the blue face on the part for the Stationary Reference selection.

300 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
 
5. Select each of the bends on the folded model. Each bend will highlight when you hover 
your mouse pointer over it, so you know when you have a valid selection. The unfolded 
preview updates as you select each bend. Alternatively, you can use the Add All Bends 
button.
 
6. Click the Sketches button and select the visible sketch in the graphics window so that it is 
unfolded to match the face it resides on.
 
7. Click the OK button. The model should look like Figure 6.23. Note that a copy of the 
sketch was placed on the unfolded model and that the original (Sketch12) is still dis-
played as a reference.
Figure 6.23

with sketch
 
8. Right-click Sketch12 in the browser and choose Visibility to toggle off its visibility so that 
the copied sketch can be more easily viewed.
You may have noticed that there was an option to turn off the visibility of the parent 
sketch in the Unfold tool as well. Most likely that is the way you would handle copied 
sketches, but in this case you’ve been instructed to do this manually to observe the way 
the sketches are copied. In the next steps you will create formed slots using the copied 
sketch.
 
9. Click the Cut button in the Modify panel.
 
10. Select the two oblong profi les in the copied sketch and click the OK button.
 
11. Select the 3DModel tab and click Extrude.
 
12. Select the two oblong profi les in the copied sketch.
 
13. Click the fl yout arrow in the Distance input box and choose List Parameters; then select 
Thickness from the list (or just type Thickness in the input box).
 
14. Click the Symmetric button so that the extrusion will extend equally in both directions 
from the sketch plane and then click the OK button.
 
15. Expand the Unfold1 feature in the browser, right-click Sketch12 and choose Visibility to 
turn off the sketch.

GETTING TO KNOW THE FEATURES | 301
 
16. Select the Sheet Metal tab and click Refold in the Modify panel.
 
17. Select the yellow face on the part to use as the new stationary reference.
 
18. Click the Add All Bends button to automatically select all the bends. Then click the OK 
button.
Note that the model is in a different position than it was before the unfold action since the 
yellow face was kept stationary during the refold. If you drag the End-of-Folded marker above 
the Unfold feature, the model will be in its original position. As you can see, using the Unfold 
and Refold tools offers a lot of possibilities for placing features in a fl attened version of the 
model. You can close this fi le without saving changes.
Unfolding and Refolding Contour Rolls Features
You can also unfold or refold a contour roll. If the tools detect that the part is a contour roll, 
work planes are displayed on each end face. Since a fl at reference face is required, you can select 
one of the work planes and then unfold the contour roll, as shown in Figure 6.24.
Figure 6.24
Unfolding a con-
tour roll
You can open the fi le mi_6a_030.ipt located in the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and experiment with unfolding and refolding the part.
Project Flat Pattern Tool
A well-hidden segment of sheet-metal-specifi c functionality is a special version of sketch pro-
jection called Project Flat Pattern (nested at the end of the sketch projection fl yout). Project Flat 
Pattern is available from the folded model environment and is utilized to include the projected 
edges of the fl attened sheet-metal component, oriented to the sketch plane that is active.
This option is powerful when combined with the Cut Across Bend option because it allows 
you to create parametric dimensions and constrained relationships from the perspective of the 
fl attened sheet. When utilizing the Project Flat Pattern option, it isn’t necessary to select every 
face; just pick the ones at the extremities (ensuring that they’re on the same fl attened side of 
the part as your sketch), and all the connecting planar faces and bends will automatically be 
included.

Objective

302 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
In the following steps, you’ll use the Project Flat Pattern tool to place sketch entities as they 
would be on the fl at pattern. You’ll then use the Cut Across Bends option of the Cut tool to cre-
ate the features in place on this rather extreme example of a bent sheet-metal part.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_021.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of the Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Select the orange face and create a new 2D sketch on it.
 
4. Click the drop-down arrow next to the Project Geometry button and select Project Flat 
Pattern from the drop-down menu.
 
5. Select one of the yellow faces to project the chain of faces between it and the orange face 
into the sketch; then select the other yellow face to complete both sides.
 
6. Try to select the blue faces to project into the sketch, and you’ll note that nothing 
happens.
Nothing happens because the blue faces are actually opposite the original orange face 
when this part is fl attened out. You could select the underside of the blue faces to include 
them in the sketch, but in this case you can just use the green faces.
 
7. Select the green faces to project the remainder of the fl at pattern into the sketch. Keep in 
mind that you really only need to project the faces you plan to use in the sketch, but for 
this example you’ve been instructed to select them all.
 
8. Next, add three circles to the sketch. Two of the circles are to be placed at the center 
points of the projected yellow faces and will be 50 mm in diameter, and the third circle 
will be 25 mm in diameter and is to be placed in line with the center of the part and 
375 mm off the tip of the orange face. Figure 6.25 shows the completed sketch.
Figure 6.25

9. Click the Finish Sketch button when the sketch is complete and then select the Cut tool 
from the Modify panel.

USING SHEETMETAL TEMPLATES AND RULES | 303
 
10. Select all three of the circles for the Profi le selection.
 
11. Select the Cut Across Bend check box and then click the OK button.
The result is that the circular cuts are placed on the folded model in accordance with their 
position in the fl at pattern. This ability to lay out features in the fl at pattern and then cut them 
across existing bends is a subtle but powerful tool. Keep in mind, too, that the projected fl at pat-
tern is fully associative and will update along with changes made to the features from which it 
was created. You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue on to the next section.
Using Sheet-Metal Templates and Rules
Inventor offers the ability to create sheet-metal rules that can be stored in the Inventor style 
library. The style library makes sheet-metal defi nition information more manageable, more reus-
able, and ultimately more powerful than simply using a template fi le to manage sheet-metal 
styles; however, using sheet-metal styles and templates to manage material and unfolding set-
ups is supported.
What Are Sheet-Metal Rules?
Sheet-metal parts of a certain material and thickness often share bend, corner, and gap param-
eters. The unfold, bend, and corner settings as well as representation of punch features in the 
fl at pattern and the bending angle or open angle option when the part is shown in the fl at pat-
tern all make up a sheet-metal rule. For instance, you might have a sheet-metal rule called 3 mm 
Galvanized Steel. In this rule, the material would be set to galvanized steel, the thickness to 
3 mm, and the bend, corner, punch representation, and fl at pattern bend angle settings would be 
confi gured to output those features consistently.
When a new part is created, you can select the predefi ned sheet-metal rule, and the part will 
follow the settings outlined within it. When a new feature such as a fl ange is added, the bend 
and corner options defi ned in the rule are automatically used to defi ne it. If a setting such as a 
corner relief needs to deviate from the rule, it can be modifi ed in the feature as needed. If the 
part is changed to use a different sheet-metal rule, the overridden settings honor the overrides, 
and all others update to match the rule settings.
Creating a Sheet-Metal Rule
Sheet-metal rules are created and accessed in one of two ways. You can click the Styles Editor 
button on the Manage tab, or you can click the Sheet Metal Defaults button found on the Sheet 
Metal tab. The Sheet Metal Defaults dialog, shown in Figure 6.26, allows you to specify the 
sheet-metal rule and whether to use the thickness, material style, and unfold rules defi ned in 
the sheet-metal rule or to override them.
To create or edit a sheet-metal rule, click the Edit Sheet Metal Rule button (it looks like a pen-
cil), and the Style And Standard Editor appears. Figure 6.27 shows the sheet-metal rule options 
in the Style And Standard Editor.

the sheet thickness, or you can set it to a fi xed value.
 
6. Set the bend angle to either Bending Angle or Opening Angle.
 
7. Set the Flat Pattern Punch Representation style.
 
8. Click the Bend tab and set the bend options.

Bend and Corner Quick References in the Help Files
Autodesk has done a good job of hiding the help references for many of the sheet-metal features. 
However, once you ﬁ nd them, they are helpful in determining what these options adjust. When 
you ﬁ nd them, you can create a Favorites link so they are more accessible. Here are a couple you 
might want to add to your favorites:
Sheet Metal Bend Options  Press F1 to bring up the help pages. On the Contents tab, 
expand the tree to ﬁ nd Autodesk Inventor ➢ Parts ➢ Sheet Metal Parts ➢ Sheet Metal 
Features ➢ Faces and then click the Quick Reference tab in the right pane. Select Sheet 
Metal Bend Options.
Sheet Metal Corner Options  Press F1 to bring up the help pages. On the Contents 
tab, expand the tree to ﬁ nd Autodesk Inventor ➢ Parts ➢ Sheet Metal Parts ➢ Sheet Metal 
Features ➢ Corner Seams and then click the Quick Reference tab in the right pane. Select 
Sheet Metal Corner Options.
To add them to your favorites, click the Favorites tab and click Add in the left pane while viewing 
the page. Once they are added, you can rename them via the context menu.
Sheet-Metal Rules vs. Sheet-Metal Styles
Sheet-metal rules are set up using the Style And Standard Editor. Initially, the rules are created 
in a part fi le as a local style, meaning they exist in that part fi le only. If you save the part fi le as 
a template fi le, all of your new parts will contain the sheet-metal rule. In addition to using tem-
plates to manage sheet-metal rules, you can add the rules to the style library. Style libraries are 
XML fi les that are stored externally to the part fi les and therefore can be used by newly created 
parts or existing parts. You save a rule to a library by right-clicking the rule in the Style And 
Standard Editor and selecting Save To Style Library, assuming your project (.ipj) fi le is set up 
to use a style library.
Unfold Rules
Whenever you fold a sheet-metal part on the shop fl oor, some material deformation occurs at 
the bend location. To the outside of the bend the material stretches, and to the inside of the 
bend the material is compressed. To calculate this deformation for each bend, Inventor uses 
sheet-metal unfold rules. Sheet-metal unfold rules control the method of unfolding used to calcu-
late the fl at pattern for a folded sheet-metal part. You can create unfold rules using a K-factor or 
a bend table.

306 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
K-Factors
K-factors defi ne the theoretical percentage of the material thickness where a folded part is 
neutral and neither expands nor contracts. The reason this surface is referred to as the neutral 
surface is that it defi nes a measurable position within the bend that has the same value in the 
folded and unfolded states. For instance, if your material is 10 mm thick and you use a K-factor 
of 0.44, bends and folds are calculated so that deformation of the bend takes place at 4.4 mm (or 
44 percent of the material thickness). Unfolding with a K-factor is accomplished by determining 
the bend allowance (the amount of material required to produce a bend) for a given bend using 
the sheet thickness, the bend angle, the inner bend radius, and a K-factor value. The K-factor you 
use will depend on numerous factors, including material, thickness, and tooling. Most likely, 
you will need to perform a number of test bends on a specifi c press brake to determine the ideal 
K-factor for you.
The following equation is used to determine the developed fl at pattern length using a 
K-factor:
Total Length = Leg 1 + Leg 2 + Bend Allowance
The bend allowance is calculated using this equation:
BA = π × (A/180) × (R + K × T)
In this equation, the abbreviations have the following meanings:
 
◆
BA = bend allowance
 
◆
A = bend angle in degrees
 
◆
R = inside bend radius
 
◆
K = K-factor
 
◆
T = material thickness
Figure 6.28 shows a basic bend.

Custom Unfold Equations
In addition to K-factors and bend tables, you can create custom unfold equations to use as an 
unfold method. You can ﬁ nd more information concerning custom unfold equations by selecting 
the Index tab of the help ﬁ le and searching the keyword Unfolding and then selecting Sheet Metal 
Equations from the list.
To create an unfold rule to use a K-factor, follow these general steps:
 
1. Select the Manage tab and click the Styles Editor button to open the Style And Standard 
Editor dialog box.
 
2. Click the plus sign to the left of the Sheet Metal Unfold Rule node in the left pane of the 
Style And Standard Editor dialog box to display the existing unfold rules.
 
3. Click an existing default rule to serve as the template for the new rule.
 
4. Click the New button along the top of the Style And Standard Editor dialog box.
 
5. Enter the name of the new sheet-metal unfold rule and click the OK button.
 
6. Ensure that the unfold method is set to Linear.
 
7. Enter a new K-factor value.
 
8. Click the Save button at the top of the Style And Standard Editor dialog box. The rule is 
now saved in the current part fi le.
 
9. Optionally, right-click the new unfold rule name in the left list and choose Save To Style 
Library to write the new unfold rule to the external style library XML fi le.
 
10. Click Done to exit the Style And Standard Editor dialog box.
Bend Tables
An alternative to using K-factors is to create a bend table. Using bend tables is the most accurate 
method of unfolding because bend tables are created by taking measurements of actual bent 
test parts of the exact material and thickness made on the shop fl oor. To create a bend table in 
Inventor, you must fi rst gather accurate bend information by creating bend tests. The granular-
ity of the experimental values is up to you. It could be based on 15-degree increments or perhaps 
0.5-degree increments; it depends on how much experimental data you have.
Typically, a number of test blanks are cut from a given material and thickness and then bent 
to the most common angles and radii used. If you measure the folded sample using virtual 
sharp locations, the values obtained will inherently be too large. The overmeasurement of the 
test fold sample needs to be compensated for by deducting an amount of length. By subtract-
ing your combined measurements from the initial measurement of the sample taken prior to 
folding, you will be able to determine the value of excessive length (overmeasurement); this is 
what gets entered into the bend table and is where the method name bend deduction comes from. 
Bends are then calculated as follows:
Total Length = Leg 1 + Leg 2 – Bend Deduction

308 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
You can set up a test bend table as described in the following steps:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab, and choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_6a_022.ipt from the Chapter 06 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. On the Sheet Metal tab, select Sheet Metal Defaults.
 
4. Click the Edit button for Unfold Rule (it looks like a pencil).
 
5. In the Style And Standard Editor, expand the Sheet Metal Unfold node from the list on 
the left (if it’s not already expanded), select Default_KFactor, and then click the New but-
ton at the top. This creates a new unfold rule based on the existing one.
 
6. Enter Mastering Bend Table for the name and click the OK button.
 
7. Change the Unfold Method drop-down box to Bend Table.
 
8. Set Linear Unit to millimeter (mm) to match the units of this part fi le.
 
9. Click the Click Here To Add row in the Thickness box, and enter 2.00 for 2 millimeters.
 
10. Enter 30 into the leftmost cell of the table to defi ne the angle at 30 degrees.
 
11. Enter 1.0 in the topmost cell to defi ne the bend radius at 1 mm.
 
12. Enter 0.5 in the cell to the right of the angle cell and just under the bend radius cell. This 
is the bend deduction (in this case, 0.5 is a hypothetical value).
 
13. Add another bend angle row by right-clicking the cell containing 30 and choosing 
Insert Row.
 
14. Enter 45 for the angle and 0.6 for the bend deduction.
 
15. Add another bend radius column by right-clicking the cell containing 1.000000 and 
choosing Insert Column.
 
16. Enter 2.0 in the column header for the bend radius and then enter 0.55 for the 30-degree 
row and 0.65 for the 45-degree row.
 
17. Add a third row of 60 degrees with 0.70 and 0.75 bend deductions in the 1.000000-degree 
and 2.000000-degree columns, respectively.
 
18. Add a third column of 3.0 mm with 0.60, 0.70, and 0.80 for the 30-, 45-, and 60-degree 
rows, respectively.
 
19. Bends greater than 90 degrees and bends less than 90 degrees are handled differently, so 
in this case you want to set the Angle Reference radio button to use the Bending Angle 
Reference (A) option. This allows the table to match the existing part. If you wanted to 
use the Open Angle Reference (B) option, your table angles would need to be 150, 135, 
and 120. You can check your table against the one in Figure 6.29.
 
20. Click Save and then Done to fi nish the bend table.
 
21. In the Sheet Metal Defaults dialog box, choose Mastering Bend Table from the Unfold 
Rule drop-down box to make it the active unfold rule for this part and then click the OK 
button.

Bending Angle and Open Angle References
Originally, the Inventor Bend Table was designed to reference an open angle datum structure (which 
is still the default) for measuring bends. However, the sheet-metal features all use a bending angle 
datum structure to create bent features. As a means to bridge this disparity in measurement con-
vention, the Bend Angle option at the top of the bend table interface allows you to declare the 
structure in which your values were measured; Inventor will use this option to convert the values 
internally if necessary. Keep in mind that the angular values are not altered within the table when 
this option is changed.
As you can see, the process of creating a bend table in Inventor is a straightforward endeavor. 
Typically, the real work is in creating the test blanks and bends to gather the information to put 
into the table.
Here are a few more things to know about creating bend tables:
 
◆
Note that you can reorder rows and columns by clicking the header cell and dragging them 
into place.
 
◆
You can also right-click the top, leftmost cell and choose Paste Table to paste in a table copied 
from an Excel spreadsheet. Likewise, you can choose Copy Table to copy the table into Excel.
 
◆
You can add a bend table for each thickness required by clicking the Click To Add row in 
the Thickness box.
 
◆
If the bend deduction is outside of the values defi ned in the table, Inventor uses the Backup 
K-factor. You can think of this as an insurance plan that allows you to obtain a fl at pattern 
even if your bend table doesn’t defi ne what deduction to use for smaller or larger combina-
tions of bend angle and radius.
 
◆
For combinations that fall within the table boundaries but not exactly at angle/radius 
coordinate values, Inventor uses linear approximation to derive a value; depending on the 
change in bend compensation between steps in the table, you can achieve better results 
with smaller angle increments.
 
◆
You can specify a table tolerance to allow Inventor to include thicknesses, radii, and angles 
that are within the specifi ed tolerance. For example, if the angle tolerance is 0.004 and a 
bend angle measures 30.002, Inventor would use the 45-degree row in your table to calcu-
late the deduction.

310 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
To test the bend table, you can examine the fl at pattern in mi_6a_022.ipt, where a sketch 
has already been placed to display the fl at pattern length. Because the part fi le has a current 
thickness of 2 mm, a bend angle of 60 degrees, and a bend radius of 2 mm, the bend deduction 
indexed from the bend table will be 0.75 mm, as shown in Figure 6.29.
In this case, then, the bend deduction is calculated as follows:
Leg 1 + Leg 2 – Bend Deduction = Total Flat Pattern Length
25 mm + 25 mm – 0.75 mm = 49.25 mm
If you were to change the angle to 45 degrees (and click the Update button) and check the fl at 
pattern again, you would expect to see this:
25 mm + 25 mm – 0.65 mm = 49.35 mm
What would happen if you were to set the angle to 37.5 degrees, which is halfway 
between 30 and 45 degrees? Because the bend table has no entry for 37.5 degrees, Inventor 
uses a linear extrapolation of the bend deductions of 0.55 mm for 30 degrees and 0.65 mm for 
45 degrees and arrives at the halfway point of 0.60 mm for 37.5 degrees. If you check the fl at 
pattern, you will expect to see this:
25 mm + 25 mm – 0.60 mm = 49.4 mm
K-Factors and Bend Tables: Which Should I Use?
Th e most common question asked about ﬂ at patterns concerns the use of K-factors and bend tables. 
Which to use depends on your manufacturing processes and the capabilities of your machines. 
Th ese are the main questions to ask when determining which is right for you:
 
◆
Do you outsource your sheet-metal manufacturing?
 
◆
How accurate do your parts need to be?
Whether you build the parts in-house or you outsource them, you should be able to get the data from 
the shop. If your sheet-metal shop is unsophisticated, they may use rules of thumb to determine 
the bend allowance. In that case, you need to work with them to determine whether a K-factor or 
a bend table is the best solution. One of the advantages of using sheet-metal rules is that you can 
create rules for each shop. For example, if you generally use your shop but you outsource when you 
are busy, you can select the rule for the other shop, and the ﬂ at pattern will automatically update.
In general, K-factors are used for parts with large tolerances. Since the K-factor is an approxima-
tion, the actual value will vary depending on the machine. For parts with very tight tolerances, 
you need to know speciﬁ c compensation values for the bend radius and angle for the machine, 
material type, and thickness. Depending on the material, you might need diﬀ erent values based 
on the grain direction. For extremely tight tolerances with certain material types, you might even 
need diﬀ erent values for each shipment of material.

USING SHEETMETAL TEMPLATES AND RULES | 311
Bend Compensation
In addition to using K-factors and bend tables, you have the ability to enter an expression for a 
bend compensation. Instead of entering values for specifi c bend angles and using linear interpola-
tion between the values, you can enter ranges of bend angles that use an expression to deter-
mine the proper compensation within that range. To access the Bend Compensation settings, 
click the Style Editor button on the Manage tab and then expand the Sheet Metal Unfold node 
in the left pane. Finally, select BendCompensation. Figure 6.30 shows the BendCompensation 
settings.
Figure 6.30
BendCompensation 
settings
Working with Styles and Templates
If your project location is set to use the style library, it is important to understand what has been 
defi ned within your template and what has been stored within the style library. For example, 
suppose you have a sheet-metal rule named MyRule1 with the Thickness value equal to 2 mm 
stored only locally in your template fi le, and another sheet-metal rule also named MyRule1 but 
with the Thickness value equal to 5 mm, also stored in your style library. Each time you start 
a new design from the template referencing MyRule1, you will see a Thickness value of 5 mm 
being applied. The reason for this is that the style library is the “published” source of your stan-
dards; its defi nition will always win. After saving your design, if you want to make changes 
to the Thickness value of MyRule1, you can apply the changes without fear that they might be 
automatically overwritten because this occurs only when creating a new document using the 
template. (As a side note, if you did want to overwrite the local/document defi nition with the 
style library’s defi nition, right-clicking an existing rule will present a context menu from which 
you can select Update Style, which will manually refresh the rule’s defi nition in the document.)
It is a good practice when using the style library to have only a single generic sheet-metal 
rule embedded in your template fi le (at least one is required). Once you know what sheet-metal 
rule you want to apply to your model, selecting it either in the Style And Standard Editor dia-
log box or in the Sheet Metal Defaults dialog box will automatically draw the information into 
the active document. This process keeps extraneous information out of your document, pro-
viding a smaller footprint, and helps reduce the chance of style information mismatch. If you 
have a template fi le that has numerous sheet-metal rules stored within it, after publishing them 

312 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
to the style library, you can use the purge functionality with the Style Management Wizard to 
remove them.
Working with the Flat Pattern
The fl at pattern derived from the folded model ties the design to the manufacturing environ-
ment. Within Inventor, the fl at pattern model is an actual fl attened version of the folded model 
vs. a sheet that has been pieced together and thickened. Numerous tools, utilities, and data 
sources have been provided to enable the fl at pattern to suit your individual manufacturing and 
documentation needs.
The fl at pattern contains a wealth of manufacturing information that is stored progressively 
during the design process. Punch and bend information is stored within the fl at pattern model 
specifi cally so that customers working with drawings, customers working with the application 
programming interface (API), or those who want to translate the fl at pattern to a different fi le 
version can control all their options in a common location; the fl at pattern is commonly referred 
to as the jumping-off point for all downstream consumers.
The following sections detail these capabilities and tools.
Exploring the Flat Pattern Edit Features
The fl at pattern environment has its own panel bar containing a customized set of modeling 
tools drawn from the Part Features panel bar and the Sheet Metal Features panel bar. The fl at 
pattern tools are referred to as fl at pattern edit features because they are intended to apply small 
alterations to the fl at pattern model instead of doing large-scale modeling. Flat pattern edit 
features are applied only to the fl at pattern, whereas folded model features are fi rst applied to 
the folded model and then carried over to the fl at pattern. The fl at pattern can be imagined as a 
derivative of the folded model, establishing a parent-child relationship (fl at pattern edit features 
are not refl ected in the folded model). There are many situations in which the generated fl at 
pattern is not exactly what you need for manufacturing; fl at pattern edit features are ideal for 
making small associative tweaks that previously required exporting the fl at pattern to an exter-
nal (disassociated) fi le.
Adding Manufacturing Information to the Flat Pattern
There are two features specifi cally designed to allow you to add manufacturing information 
to the fl at pattern. The Bend Order Annotation tool enables you to specify the order in which 
bends are created. The Cosmetic Centerlines tool marks bend locations, such as cross brakes, 
where there is mild deformation.
Bend Order Annotation  When you click the Bend Order Annotation icon in the Manage 
panel, the bends are automatically numbered. You can renumber individual bends by 
double-clicking the number glyph or right-clicking and choosing one of two options for over-
riding the numbering: Directed Reorder and Sequential Reorder. Figure 6.31 shows the bend 
order being edited.

Objective

WORKING WITH THE FLAT PATTERN | 313
Figure 6.31
Editing the

Directed Reorder  With this option you are prompted for the selection of a start glyph 
and an end glyph. An algorithm is used to renumber bend centerlines that lie between 
the selected start and end glyphs.
Sequential Reorder  With this option you select each bend centerline glyph in the reor-
der sequence.
You can follow these general steps to adjust bend order:
 
1. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
2. Click the Bend Order Annotation button on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
3. You can select a specifi c bend centerline glyph (or glyphs) and enter the new order 
number or right-click and choose one of the reorder methods.
 
4. Right-click and choose Finish Bend Order.
Cross Breaks, Creases, and Cosmetic Centerlines  When working with large parts made 
with thin sheet materials (such as in HVAC designs), you may have a need to show cross-
break information. Adding these features in the folded model is a challenge and is generally 
not required. Instead, you can add cross-break information to the fl at pattern in the form of 
cosmetic centerlines. Cosmetic centerlines capture bend information in the fl at pattern with-
out changing the model. Figure 6.32 shows the Cosmetic Centerlines tool in use.
Figure 6.32

breaks with

Centerlines tool

314 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
To create cross-break lines, follow these general steps:
 
1. Click the Create Flat Pattern button (or the Go To Flat Pattern button if it’s already cre-
ated) on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
2. Create a new 2D sketch on the appropriate face of the fl at pattern (click the OK button if 
warned about the sketches on the fl at pattern not carrying over to the folded model).
 
3. Use the Line tool to create the cross-break lines as needed.
 
4. Click the Finish Sketch button on the Sketch tab.
 
5. Click the Cosmetic Centerline button (on the Create panel in the Flat Pattern tab) and 
select any previously sketched lines.
 
6. Adjust the manufacturing information using the controls in the Cosmetic Centerline 
dialog box and then click the OK button.
A Cosmetic Centerline feature will be created in the browser, and it will consume the 
sketch you created. You can edit it as you would any other feature if needed.
Using the Flat Pattern Deﬁ nition Dialog Box
You can manipulate the fl at pattern model by using a tool called Edit Flat Pattern Defi nition, 
which is available by right-clicking anywhere in the graphics area and selecting Edit Flat Pattern 
Defi nition. The Flat Pattern Defi nition dialog box allows you to control a number of aspects per-
taining to the fl at pattern’s orientation and the information stored within it, as shown in Figure 6.33.
Figure 6.33
Assigning ﬂ at 
pattern orien-
tation to run 
on diﬀ erent 
machinery
The fi rst tab of the Flat Pattern Defi nition dialog box relates to the fl at pattern orientation. 
The selection control allows you to select either an edge or two points to defi ne the horizontal or 
vertical orientation. The orientation of the fl at pattern is important because the implied x-axis is 
used to calculate the rotational angle of Punch tools that have been applied to the model. When 
you orient the fl at pattern to your specifi c punch equipment, the required tool rotation angle 
should be directly available from your fl at pattern.
Since the fl at pattern base face is going to be either the face already selected or the backside, 
the control of the base face has been simplifi ed to a “fl ip” option. Base face defi nition is critical 

WORKING WITH THE FLAT PATTERN | 315
because it establishes a directional reference for bends and punch tooling as well as an associa-
tion with the front navigation tool view and the default Drawing Manager view.
The second tab is the Punch Representation tab, which allows you to override the representa-
tion setting in the sheet-metal document without having to edit the active sheet-metal rule.
The third tab is the Bend Angle tab, which allows you to declare how bend angles should 
be reported to the API and Drawing Manager. For example, this means that by changing the 
Bend Angle option to an open angle, Drawing Manager annotations of your fl attened bends will 
recover the complementary angle of the bending angle.
Controlling the Finished Face of the Flat Pattern
If you work with preﬁ nished surface materials, having the ﬁ nish side up when laser cutting, punch-
ing, or breaking is often an important consideration. To control the upward-facing surface, or base 
face, when creating the ﬂ at pattern, you can select any face of the folded part on the ﬁ nished side 
and then click the Create Flat Pattern button. Inventor will hold the selected face as the base face.
If you need to change the base face, you can use the Flip button found in the Pattern Deﬁ nition 
dialog box. Do this by clicking the Go To Flat Pattern button, right-clicking the Flat Pattern node 
in the browser, and selecting Edit Flat Pattern Deﬁ nition.
Manufacturing Your Flat Pattern
There is a close association between sheet-metal design and manufacturing, and the fl at pattern 
solution within Inventor embraces this relationship. Inventor generically supports the ability to 
translate models to a variety of fi le formats, but Inventor sheet metal actually has its own utility 
to support the translation to SAT (.sat), DWG (.dwg), and DXF (.dxf) formats.
Saving Flat Patterns
After selecting the Flat Pattern browser node, you can right-click and select Save Copy As; 
this launches the Flat Pattern Translation dialog box. For SAT fi les, a simple option defi ning 
the fi le version will be presented. For DWG and DXF fi le formats, an extensive list of options and 
fi le-processing capabilities is made available to you.
Within the Flat Pattern Translation dialog box, you will fi nd standard options for fi le type, 
but there is also a Layer tab that supports layer naming and visibility control. The last tab is the 
Geometry tab, which allows you to decide whether you want to apply a variety of manufacturing-
specifi c options to the translation. The fi rst of these options is for spline simplifi cation because 
many Computer Numerical Control (CNC)–profi le manufacturing centers cannot leverage splines 
and are restricted to arcs and lines.
Translating Splines
The translation utility allows you to apply faceting rules to break the outer contour of fl at 
patterns into linear segments. The second options group relates to the post-processing of the 
translated fi le, allowing you to force the 2D result into positive coordinate space and to merge 
interior and exterior contours into polylines, which may be critical for a path-based tool. 
Figure 6.34 shows these settings.

DXF ﬁ le
Sketching on Flat Patterns
Sometimes you’ll need additional tool path manufacturing information such as etch lines in 
your DXF/DWG output. For this, the fl at pattern has the ability to export unconsumed sketches 
created on the fl at pattern. With these you can create a sketch containing the lines you need on 
the fl at pattern. Once you save the DXF or DWG fi le, any visible sketches located on the fl at pat-
tern are exported, and a layer called IV_UNCONSUMED_SKETCHES is added to contain these 
sketches. Note that sketch text will not export using this method. If you need to add single-line 
text paths to your fl at pattern for laser engraving, the best method is to do so in the DWG or 
DXF after it has been exported from Inventor.
Using Sheet-Metal iPart Factories
iParts are part confi gurations or part families that allow you to create a base part and then add 
a table to it. Once the table is added, the part features can be suppressed or confi gured to create 
a family of parts based on the original. The confi gured part is referred to as an iPart factory, and 
the individual confi gurations are called members. Sheet-metal iParts have a number of uses, from 
creating variations of basic parts to creating progressive die parts.
More iPart Information
You can ﬁ nd more information, including step-by-step instructions for creating iParts and sheet-
metal iParts, in Chapter 7.

MODELING WITH NONSHEETMETAL FEATURES | 317
iParts for Conﬁ gurations
Using iParts for sheet-metal confi gurations is common for parts that are basically the same 
but vary in the size, material, or inclusion of certain features. For example, a bracket could 
be designed and confi gured in basic mild steel, or optionally in an upgraded stainless steel 
version. Or you could create an iPart to handle variable hole locations on a standard-shaped 
bracket. Another common use would be a series of brackets that are identical in material and 
fold information but vary in length. Sheet-metal confi gurations via iParts could be benefi cial 
and profi table to a company that deals in varieties of components that need to fi t into the same 
space but utilize different materials or manufacturing processes or contain different features. 
Once different members of the iPart factory are confi gured, you can use the Generate Files 
option shown in Figure 6.35.
Figure 6.35
Sheet-metal 
iPart fac-
tory example, 
displaying 
Generate Files 
for selected 
member ﬁ les
This tool is intended to support the batch creation of member fi les on disk; it can also be used 
to force updates, such as the fl at pattern, out to the member fi les already in existence. In addi-
tion, you can use a pull method vs. a push method. If you open the iPart factory, execute the 
Rebuild All operation, and then save the rebuilt and migrated data, the member fi les when indi-
vidually opened will “see” that they are out-of-date with the factory. Selecting the now-enabled 
Update button within the individual member fi le will then draw in the fl at pattern information 
automatically.
iParts for Fold Progression
If you have the need to show the order in which a part is created, such as detailing progres-
sive dies, you might want to explore the use of iParts and the Unfold tool. Once a folded part is 
complete, you can convert it to an iPart and use the Unfold tool to detail each step of the pro-
gression. In the iPart, the unfold features can then be suppressed to show the part folding back 
up. Because each iPart member (in this case representing the same part in different stages) can 
be detailed on a drawing, you can quickly illustrate the progression of the blank, fl at piece to 
the fi nished part.
Modeling with Non-Sheet-Metal Features
Although the sheet-metal feature set is extensive, sometimes using non-sheet-metal features 
can be helpful or possibly even required to accomplish your design. The challenge when using 
non-sheet-metal features is to honor the guiding principles of sheet-metal design so that the 
resulting component can be unfolded; in addition, you want to incorporate sheet-metal condi-
tions so that the features are manufacturable and therefore cost-effective.

318 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Selecting Problematic Features
Although it’s possible to design sheet-metal components using lofts, solid sweeps, and shells, 
these features can produce unpredictable and hard-to-control results. The Loft tool, unless 
highly restricted, produces doubly curved surfaces that cannot be unfolded properly. It’s pos-
sible to utilize rails to control loft curvature, but it’s time-consuming and invariably frustrating. 
Solid sweeps are a measure better than lofts, but these too can create unintended doubly curved 
surfaces. The Shell tool can be used nine times out of ten to successfully create a legitimate 
sheet-metal feature, but the tenth time, if it doesn’t work and it’s not clear why, will be con-
founding. If you use the parameter Thickness to shell your component, you’ll probably be in 
fairly good shape, but there are certain situations in which the Shell tool cannot assure uniform 
thickness after the shell. These situations are not always simple to predict.
Using Surface-Based Workﬂ ows
In addition to the sheet-metal-specifi c tools, you might sometimes need to use standard non-
sheet-metal tools to create complex parts or features. The most successful non-sheet-metal feature 
workfl ows typically use a surface that is later thickened. The reason these workfl ows are so suc-
cessful is that it’s often easier to ensure that the resulting model embodies sheet-metal conditions 
(the side faces are perpendicular to the top and bottom faces and the part maintains a constant 
thickness) since the part can be thickened normal to the surface using the Thicken/Offset tool. 
When you’re constructing surfaces that will be thickened, the Extrude and Revolve tools are 
excellent choices because they have restricted directions in which features are created, which can 
help ensure that only cones, cylinders, and planes are created (these can be unfolded).
The Sweep tool is possibly another good choice, but care needs to be taken to ensure that 
the profi le and the sweep path do not contain any splines or ellipses that might prevent unfold-
ing. For thickened, extruded, revolved, or swept features, the sketch profi le geometry should 
ideally be limited to arcs and lines to help ensure the creation of unfoldable geometry. When 
you’re using the Sweep tool, the Guide Surface option (see Chapter 5, “Advanced Modeling 
Techniques”) is ideal because the swept profi le is rotated along the path to ensure that it 
remains normal to the guide surface. Sometimes a thickened sheet-metal component needs to 
be trimmed with a complicated profi le. For these situations, a swept surface combined with the 
sculpt feature can result in a model that still has sheet-metal conditions.
Another common surface-generating workfl ow is to use a derived component, where you 
select the Body As Work Surface option when placing the derived component into the sheet-
metal fi le. This workfl ow can be combined well with either a thicken feature or a sheet-metal face 
feature after creating projected sketches for each planar surface. This was the method used ear-
lier in this chapter when you used the Bend tool to create an enclosure from the derived frame.
One of the biggest benefi ts of working with surfaces is that you can apply complicated altera-
tions to the surface prior to thickening. Some of the most common features utilized to create cutting 
surfaces are Extrude, Revolve, and Sweep. Additionally, the Split tool (and perhaps Delete Face) can 
be utilized to remove faces from the thickened surface selection.
Working with Imported Parts
The Inventor sheet-metal environment has been designed to work with imported geometry 
because its solid unfold engine is concerned with topology, not with features. This means 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

WORKING WITH IMPORTED PARTS | 319
that fi les imported directly from other 3D modelers such as SolidWorks, CATIA, and Pro/
ENGINEER, as well as neutral fi le types such as STEP, SAT, and IGES fi les (.step, .sat, and 
.iges) can be brought into Inventor. Once imported, they can be modifi ed with additional fea-
tures and unfolded, provided they maintain a constant thickness that matches the thickness set 
in the part.
More on Importing Part Files
You can ﬁ nd more information about importing part ﬁ les and exchanging data with other CAD 
systems in Chapter 14, “Exchanging Data with Other Systems.”
Setting Yourself Up for Success
There are two main methods for importing parts into Inventor: the Open dialog box and the 
Import tool that’s on the Insert panel of the Manage tab. If you are able to use Open (which is 
preferred), a standard part template is going to be utilized by default to embed initial styles and 
document options, so the fi rst step will be to use the Convert To Sheet Metal tool to draw the 
sheet-metal subtype options and rules into the document. If you use the Import tool from within 
an empty sheet-metal document, the imported geometry will be in the form of a surface. To work 
with this geometry, you will need to thicken each surface, which can be a time-consuming 
process. I recommend, when possible, that you “open” imported parts so that a solid body can 
be recovered.
The next step you need to accomplish is the measurement of the sheet thickness of your 
imported model; once you have this value, you can match it with an appropriate sheet-metal 
rule (or create a new one). Matching the thickness can be as simple as taking a measurement 
from the sheet and overriding the Thickness value within the Sheet Metal Defaults dialog box 
with a simple copy and paste. Since the solid unfolder works with evaluated topology to facili-
tate the unfolding, the thickness of the actual part must match the thickness of the active sheet-
metal rule exactly.
If the imported part contains portions that are not of uniform thickness, proper unfolding 
may not be possible; spend some time evaluating your imported model to ensure that it con-
forms to sheet-metal conditions. If your imported model contains faces defi ned by splines or 
ellipses, you are not going to be able to unfold your part. In these cases, removing these faces 
and replacing them with faces defi ned by tangent arcs may be an acceptable modifi cation.
Converting Components
On the Environments tab is the Convert To Sheet Metal tool. The purpose of this tool is to take 
a component that has been designed with a regular part template and convert that document to 
a sheet-metal subtyped document. This means all the sheet-metal reference parameters and the 
default sheet-metal rule and unfold rule are automatically added to the document.
You can also convert a sheet-metal part back to a part document. Basically, this deletes the 
fl at pattern and disables the sheet-metal functionality, but the sheet-metal parameters are not 
deleted.

320 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
Be Careful When Converting Back to a Standard Part
You should convert a sheet-metal part back to a standard part ﬁ le only if the manufacturing process 
for a part has changed. Some people have gotten into the habit of using the convert tools to access 
the part-modeling tools. Using the convert tools to navigate back and forth can have undesirable 
eﬀ ects. Most notably, it can delete your ﬂ at pattern and break associations with downstream 
documentation; therefore, use the convert tools sparingly.
Annotating Your Sheet-Metal Design
The Drawing Manager environment contains several tools and functions specifi cally focused 
on helping you document your sheet-metal design. A quick overview of sheet-metal annotation 
tools might help you understand them a bit better.
Creating a View of Your Sheet-Metal Design
The fi rst step in creating your documentation will be to choose which model fi le to reference, 
but with sheet metal comes the added requirement of deciding between a folded model and 
a fl at pattern view, as shown in Figure 6.36. Once a sheet-metal model fi le is selected on the 
Component tab, a Sheet Metal View options group will appear immediately below the fi le’s 
path information. The displayed options allow you to choose between creating a folded or fl at 
pattern view and, in the case of a fl at pattern, choose whether you want center marks to be 
recovered for any embedded Punch tools. The default view options will change based on your 
selection, because the fl at pattern has a clear distinction between its top (default) face and its 
bottom (backside) face. The actual orientation of the 3D fl at pattern defi nes what is a top face 
and what is a bottom face. This also impacts bend orientation with respect to what is reported as 
up and what is reported as down. All punch angular information is based on the virtual x-axis 
previewed during fl at pattern orientation.

The Model State tab may also be of interest because sheet-metal iPart members can be indi-
vidually selected when a factory fi le is referenced, as shown in Figure 6.37. Choosing between 
a folded model and a fl at pattern is also necessary when creating a drawing view of the sheet-
metal iPart member. If the member has not already been placed, selecting the member from the 
Drawing View dialog box will automatically create the fi le.

Adding Bend, Punch, and Flat Pattern Annotations
Once you’ve created the view of your sheet-metal component, you can switch to the Drawing 
Annotate tab to complete the documentation of your design. The sheet-metal annotation tools 
within the Drawing Manager are specifi c to fl at pattern views. You can add bend notes and 
punch notes, as shown in Figure 6.39.

Bend Annotation Tables
Bend notes allow you to recover bend angle, bend direction, bend radius, and K-factor (which 
is not on by default) for any bend centerline. You can utilize the General Table tool to create a 
Drawing Manager bend table (not to be confused with bend tables utilized for unfolding) that 
documents all the bends in a selected view. To create a Drawing Manager bend table, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select General from the Table panel of the Drawing Annotation tab.
 
2. Select an existing fl at pattern view.
 
3. Decide whether the chosen columns are acceptable (bend direction, angle, and so on); 
if not, alter the selected columns.
 
4. Choose the Bend ID format and enter a prefi x if desired.
 
5. Click the OK button to create the bend table.
Punch Annotation Tables
The punch note allows you to select a formed punch, center mark, or 2D alternate punch rep-
resentation in order to recover the punch angle, punch direction, punch ID, and punch depth 
(punch ID and depth need to be added to the Punch tool description when the punch feature is 
authored). When editing the punch note, you will also see a Quantity option that allows you to 
recover the number of instances of the same Punch tool in the view.
Punch table creation is a little different from bend table creation because it has been incor-
porated within the preexisting hole table annotation tools. The reason punch support was 
combined with hole tables is that you most likely used the Hole tool out of convenience, not 
necessarily to convey a manufacturing process. To make sure all of this tool-based information 
is consolidated, an enhancement to hole tables was made. After invoking the Hole Table – View 
tool and selecting a fl at pattern view, you will see that the standards in the toolbar have changed 
to refl ect predefi ned hole table standards. Within this list (as shown in Figure 6.40) is an example 
standard for punch tables, which prevents you from having to fi rst create a standard hole table 
and then edit it to add all the punch information columns.

Use Sheet-Metal Manufacturing Annotation Effectively
You may have noticed that diﬀ erent toolmakers and machinists like to see diﬀ erent annotations. 
Although there are some deﬁ nite right and wrong ways to annotate a part, a lot of gray area exists 
concerning this as well, because there is no speciﬁ c way to annotate the part “correctly.” It is in these 
areas where you must talk to your fabricators and outside vendors to determine what information 
they’d like to see on the prints and to explain what type of annotation you plan to provide. Don’t 
be afraid to ask the fabricators what information would make their job easier. As long as it does 
not impact your workﬂ ow dramatically, it might just save you some time and money on your parts.
The last annotation tool that can interact with sheet-metal properties is the Parts List tool. 
To recover fl at pattern length and width extents within the parts list, follow these steps:
 
1. From within your sheet-metal model, right-click the fi lename node in the Model browser 
and choose iProperties.
 
2. Select the Custom tab and create a new custom iProperty named Length.

324 | CHAPTER 6 SHEET METAL
 
3. Ensure that the type is set to Text.
 
4. Enter a value of = <FLAT PATTERN LENGTH> cm.
 
5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for a custom iProperty named Width, entering a value of 
= <FLAT PATTERN WIDTH> cm.
 
6. Save the sheet-metal model fi le.
 
7. From within the Drawing Manager, launch the Parts List tool.
 
8. Using the Select View tool, select a fl at pattern view of the sheet-metal model containing 
the custom iProperties, click the OK button, and place the parts list on your drawing.
 
9. Right-click your parts list, and select the Edit Parts List tool.
 
10. Right-click the table, and select Column Chooser.
 
11. Select the New Property tool and enter Length.
 
12. Repeat step 11, creating an additional property named Width.
 
13. Click the OK button.
 
14. Select the new column named Length, right-click, and select the Format Column tool.
 
15. Change the formatting and precision of the length to match your needs.
 
16. Repeat step 15 for the Width column, clicking the OK button when complete.
Saving Time with Custom iProperties
If custom property information is something you might routinely want to access, create the custom 
iProperty values in your sheet-metal template ﬁ le so that they are always available.

Chapter 7
Reusing Parts and Features
The ability to reuse parts and features in other designs is an important step in increasing pro-
ductivity. Autodesk® Inventor® software provides this ability through different workfl ows. This 
chapter introduces you to several methods that will assist you in achieving your goal.
Developing the proper workfl ow for your company will depend on several criteria. 
Depending on your involvement with the functional-design aspect of Inventor, you may be 
converting some iParts to Content Center components. Additionally, you may decide to utilize 
iParts and iFeatures for design development if your design needs require them.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Create and modify iParts
 
◆
Create and use iFeatures and punches
 
◆
Copy and clone features
 
◆
Link parameters between two fi les
 
◆
Confi gure, create, and access Content Center parts
Working with iParts
iParts differ from standard parts in that they are essentially table-driven part factories, allow-
ing for many different variations to be generated from the same basic design. When an iPart is 
inserted into an assembly, a dialog box appears that allows you to specify a variation of the orig-
inal part from the table. Figure 7.1 shows an example of three variations of the same base iPart.

Objective

328 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Within the iPart factory, you can confi gure feature sizes by specifying different values for the 
same parametric dimension, you can choose to include or suppress entire features, and you can 
confi gure the iProperties of a part. In addition to these general confi guration controls, you can con-
fi gure thread features and work features such as work planes, axes, and points. There are two basic 
forms of iParts: table-driven and custom. Both types can be combined to create a table-driven part 
that allows custom input.
Each original iPart, often called a factory part, generates individually derived, noneditable 
member parts. Member parts placed within an assembly can be replaced with a different member 
of the factory. When a member part is replaced, generally all existing Assembly constraints will 
be retained.
iParts bring several advantages within assemblies. They essentially function as completely 
different parts, allowing dimensional changes, feature suppression, and transfer of iProperties 
and other values.
Creating and Modifying iParts
iParts are created from an existing part. Existing parts already contain features and parameters. 
Although you can modify a standard part by changing the parameter values, this will affect the 
part wherever it is used. To create confi gurations of a standard part, you must fi rst convert the 
part into an iPart.
You can publish iParts to a custom content folder for use as Content Center components or 
as additional content for functional design, such as Frame Generator and Bolted Connections. 
Published iParts can also be used in other aspects of functional design such as Frame Generator.
Modifying the Parameter List
Before converting a standard part into an iPart, you should modify the parameter list and 
rename the parameters to something more meaningful than the default names, such as renam-
ing d1 to Length. To explore these tools, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_7a_001.ipt located in the Chapter 07 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
Where to Get the Files
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 7 ﬁ les from www.sybex.com/go/mastering
inventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the down-
load and setup instructions.
 
3. Click the Parameters button on the Manage tab.
 
4. The Parameters dialog box opens, and you’ll note that many of the parameters have been 
named already. Change the names of the unnamed parameters d0, d1, and d2 to Length, 

WORKING WITH IPARTS | 329
Width, and Height, as shown in Figure 7.2, and then click Done to exit the Parameters 
dialog box.
Figure 7.2
Th e Parameters 
dialog box
Tips for Working with Parameters
Recall that you cannot use spaces in parameter names; however, you can use an underscore or 
capital letters to help separate words in the parameter names, such as Base_length or BaseLength.
Be aware that modifying the parameter name after creating an iPart table will not automatically 
update the parameter name in the table; therefore, parameters should always be named before 
being included in the iPart table to maintain consistency.
Parameter names will be used as column header names in the iPart table. Parameters that have 
been renamed will automatically be pulled into the iPart table. You can manually add unnamed 
parameters to the iPart table; however, it is a best practice to give all parameters to be used in the 
iPart meaningful names.
Selecting the Export Parameter column permits creation of custom iProperties within the part 
ﬁ le. By exporting parameters as iProperties, you can easily access them in parts lists and bills of 
materials (BOMs).
Creating the iPart
Continuing from the previous steps where you modifi ed the parameter list, you’ll next create 
the iPart table, confi gure it to include columns of features you want to modify, and add rows for 
each new confi guration of the part you want to create.
 
1. On the Author panel of the Manage tab, click the Create iPart button. All the named 
parameters will automatically show up in the iPart table.
 
2. To remove columns that you do not want to include in the table, click the parameter in 
the right pane and use the << button. You can also select column headers in the table 
and then right-click and choose Delete Column. Remove all the columns except Length, 
Width, and Height. Note that the Member and Part Number columns are default columns 
and cannot be removed.

3. Add a row to the table so that you can create a variation of this part. Right-click anywhere 
in row 1, and choose Insert Row.
 
4. Set Height to 40 mm and leave the other values as they are.
 
5. Create additional rows until you have eight rows with the Length, Width, and Height

6. Once your table is complete, click the OK button.
 
7. Find the Table node in the browser and click the + sign to expand the node. You will see 
each member (variation) of the iPart table listed, as shown in Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3
iPart browser list
You can switch between members of the iPart by double-clicking a member in the list or by 
right-clicking it and choosing Activate. Making changes to the features or sketches will change 
the active member but will not automatically update the table. If you make a change and then go 

WORKING WITH IPARTS | 331
to set another member as active, you will be prompted to save the changes to the table or 
discard them. This is because the default edit mode is set to edit the entire iPart factory rather 
than the members individually. Changes made in the table will be carried through to the mem-
bers either way. You’ll learn more about adjusting the edit scope in the sections “Working with 
Sheet-Metal iParts” and “Changing Color in iParts” later in this chapter.
You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue on to the next section to explore 
the tools used to edit iParts.
Editing the iPart Table
To edit an iPart, you can double-click the Table node in the Model browser, or you can right-click 
and choose Edit Table. You can also right-click and choose Edit Via Spreadsheet to edit the table 
with Microsoft Excel. Although some iPart table-editing tasks can be done in both Inventor and 
Excel, others should be done only in Inventor. Follow these steps to explore the process of edit-
ing an iPart table:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_003.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table.
 
4. In the iPart Author dialog box, right-click the Length column header and choose Key. 
Then click the arrow and select 1 to designate that this is the fi rst parameter by which 
this part should be specifi ed.
 
5. Set the width to be key 2 and the height to be key 3; then click the OK button to close the 
iPart Author dialog box.
 
6. Right-click the table in the browser and choose List By Keys. This sets the members to be 
listed by parameter keys in descending order, creating a drill-down tree so you can select 
the length, then the width, and then the height, as shown in Figure 7.4. Note that the 
active member is designated by a check mark next to the appropriate key.

Objective

332 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Key Selection Is Important When Creating iParts
You should take time to consider how your users will utilize the parts. For example, consider a 
socket head cap screw iPart. In the iPart, you might have diameter (1/4”, 5/16”, 3/16”), pitch (UNC 
or UNF), length (2”, 3”, 4”, 5”), and material (stainless steel, alloy steel). Each of these columns 
could be key 1, but you should consider what makes it easiest to navigate to the correct part. In 
many cases, you might want to make the material the primary key, with the diameter, pitch, and 
length as the second, third, and fourth keys. Th is means that the user will ﬁ rst select the mate-
rial and only then be presented with the remaining diameters, pitches, and lengths for that given 
material. It would be a poor choice (in most cases) to have the pitch as the primary key because 
this is usually not the ﬁ rst descriptive factor when choosing a fastener.
 
7. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table again.
 
8. Click the Properties tab to see the list of iProperties that are available for this part.
 
9. Locate the Project category in the left pane and expand it to reveal the Description 
property.
 
10. Select Description and use the >> button to include it in the iPart table.
 
11. Confi rm that the Description column shows as a column in the table and then click the 
OK button.
 
12. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table Via Spreadsheet to open the 
table in Excel.
 
13. Select cells F2 through F9 and then right-click and choose Format Cells.
 
14. Set the cells to General and click the OK button. This is necessary to allow Excel to 
evaluate the expression you will build in the next step.
 
15. In cell F2, enter = C2 & “X” & D2 & “X” & E2.
 
16. Right-click cell F2 and choose Copy.
 
17. Then select cells F3 through F9, right-click, and select Paste. Figure 7.5 shows the Excel 
table complete.

18. Save the spreadsheet and close Excel.
 
19. Because your table now contains data that is not in the part fi le, you will be prompted to 
update the fi le. Click Yes in the message dialog box.
 
20. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table.
 
21. In the iPart Author dialog box, notice that the cells in the Description column are 
highlighted to inform you that there is a formula in those cells.
 
22. Click the OK button (or Cancel if no changes were made) to exit the iPart Author 
dialog box.
You can examine the iProperties of the part fi le by clicking the part name in the Model 
browser and choosing iProperties from the context menu. If you check the Description fi eld on 
the Project tab, you’ll see the value from the iPart table/Excel spreadsheet. When you switch 
members of the iPart, the description is now automatically updated. You can then close the fi le 
without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Converting an iPart to a Standard Part
You can convert an iPart to a standard part ﬁ le by right-clicking the table in the Model browser and 
choosing Delete. Th e part will assume the active members’ feature values and states.
Including and Excluding Features
A common use of iParts is to create a confi guration of a part family that might include features 
in some cases and not include them in others. You can add a column to the table to control 
feature suppression. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le named mi_7a_005.ipt located in the Chapter 07 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table.
 
4. In the iPart Author dialog box, click the Suppression tab.
 
5. Select the feature called Round_Boss1 and click the >> button to add it as a column in 
the table.
 
6. Enter Suppress for the all the 100 mm length rows.
Suppressing vs. Computing
You can enter Suppress or Compute, S or C, and 0 or 1 for the suppress/compute cells. You can mix 
these options as well, meaning you can change only some values from Compute to S, for instance.

7. Click the Verify button to ensure that you haven’t entered a value that will not work, such 
as a spelling error. Errant cells will highlight in yellow, and you should fi x them.
 
8. Click the OK button to return to the model.
 
9. Use the browser tree to activate different members, and notice that the boss features 
will be suppressed for all of the 100 mm members. Figure 7.6 shows the iPart Author 
dialog box.
Figure 7.6
Suppressing 
features
You’ll notice that by suppressing the boss feature, we have suppressed both instances of the 
boss. This is because the boss was mirrored. To suppress just one boss, you could suppress the 
mirror feature; however, doing so would suppress one of the revolved features as well because 
it was included in the mirror. Keep this in mind when creating left and right confi gurations of 
the same part. Often, you will need to create separate features so that they can be controlled 
independently.
Creating Stacked, Toggled Features
Often when creating part conﬁ gurations, you might need to create two features at the same loca-
tion so you can toggle between the two features depending on the conﬁ guration. For instance, you 
might have an existing rectangular cut but then want to add an oblong cut in the same location 
so you can set the iPart to toggle between the two. When you attempt to place the oblong cut, 
Inventor warns that the feature did not change the number of unique faces and then results in 
an error. To correct this problem, simply accept the error, and then right-click the oblong cut and 
choose Suppress Features. Th en you can set up the iPart table to toggle between the two features.
Including or Excluding Work Features in iParts
You can use the Work Features tab to indicate whether each work feature is included or 
excluded individually. A common use for this would be to create several work features in an 
iPart and then include only the one that is to be used for mating the specifi c iPart member in the 
assembly environment to control a specifi c offset value.

WORKING WITH IPARTS | 335
Working with Threaded iPart Features
You can change the thread parameters of a tapped hole or external thread feature for each 
member of the iPart table independently. Just use the Thread tab to include any thread param-
eters, which will vary. You should include all parameters that will vary between any of the 
table members; otherwise, the hole/thread feature may generate errors when you’re switching 
between members. Often these errors may not become apparent until you attempt to publish 
your iPart to Content Center.
An example of this would be if you neglected to add the Class parameter to the table, even 
though not all of the members in the table have the same thread class. The thread class would 
then be set to the original thread class and would not be changed when the iPart is switched to 
a thread that does not include the original thread class. The same would be true, of course, if the 
Class column were included but not changed.
Working with Sheet-Metal iParts
You can confi gure a family of sheet-metal parts in the same way you would with a standard 
iPart—by adjusting lengths, widths, and so on—but sheet-metal parts have some additional 
controls that can be confi gured in an iPart. For instance, you can specify the sheet-metal rule, 
the sheet-metal unfold, and a named fl at pattern orientation for individual members in an iPart. 
To edit the bend order, you must edit the member scope as opposed to making the edits per the 
iPart factory. Once the iPart is set to Member Scope, bend-order changes in the fl at pattern are 
set to the active member. You can follow these general steps to set the scope of the edits:
 
1. On the Manage tab, locate the Author panel.
 
2. Click the Edit Factory/Member Scope drop-down and set it to Edit Member Scope. 
Figure 7.7 shows the drop-down.
Figure 7.7
Setting the iPart 
edits to Member 
Scope
Member Scope vs. Factory Scope
When you set the edit scope to Edit Member Scope, changes to the model such as suppressing a 
feature are automatically added to the iPart table.
Once the scope is set to edit just members, you follow these steps to adjust the bend order per 
iPart member:
 
1. Activate the iPart member using the iPart table in the browser.
 
2. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button on the Sheet Metal tab.

336 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
 
3. Click the Bend Order Annotation button on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
4. You can select a specifi c bend centerline glyph (or glyphs) and enter the new order num-
ber, or you can right-click and choose one of these reorder methods:
Directed Reorder  You are prompted for the selection of a start glyph and an end glyph. 
An algorithm is used to renumber bend centerlines that lie between the selected start and 
end glyphs.
Sequential Reorder  You select each bend centerline glyph in the reorder sequence.
 
5. Right-click and choose Finish Bend Order.
When you edit the iPart table, you will see that the FlatPatternBendOrder column is auto-
matically added (because you are working under the member scope edit mode). The cell for the 
edited iPart member will show that it is using something other than the Default bend order.
Changing Color in iParts
To set iPart members to be different colors, you can create a custom iPart parameter on the 
Other tab and set it to the AppearanceColumn option. Then you can edit each member row of 
the iPart to be a different color/appearance. It is important that the name matches exactly, how-
ever, so be careful to match case. This means that entering red for Red will cause a mismatch. 
To avoid this, it is recommended that you use the member scope edit mode, as described in the 
previous section, to make color style edits to the part. This way, you can just set the member as 
active, change its appearance, and have the appearance change recorded in the iPart table auto-
matically. To set up an Appearance column, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_012.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table.
 
4. In the iPart Author dialog box, click the Other tab.
 
5. On the Other tab, click the Click Here To Add Value line.
 
6. Type Color for the value name.
 
7. Right-click the column header and choose Appearance Column, as shown in Figure 7.8.

8. Type Default into the Appearance column for each of the three rows. Then click the OK 
button to exit the iPart Author dialog box.
Setting Colors
Note that if you do not enter Default or a valid Appearance style, you will receive a warning that 
states “Errors occurred while setting factory to speciﬁ ed member.” You can click Accept and then 
edit the table again.
 
9. Ensure that Edit Member Scope is set (on the Manage tab, locate the Author panel and 
then set the drop-down to Edit Member Scope).
 
10. From the Quick Access bar (located at the top of the screen), select the Appearance Style 
drop-down and choose Cyan.
 
11. Expand the iPart table, use the keys to set the 25 mm × 50 mm member active, and then 
set its color to Red.
 
12. Change the edit scope to Edit Factory Scope using the iParts/iAssembly toolbar.
 
13. Use the keys to set the 50 mm × 50 mm member active and then set its color to Gold.
 
14. Right-click the table in the browser and choose Edit Table. You will receive a message 
asking whether you would like to set the table to match the document (that is, the part).
This demonstrates that when you are making edits to the model with the edit scope set 
to Factory, the changes to members do not get written back to the table automatically. 
Using the Edit Member Scope option is therefore recommended. You also get this mes-
sage if you change the active member because the table is verifi ed every time you switch 
members.
 
15. Click Yes; then take a look at the Appearance column to ensure that the colors match 
what you have set them to.
As mentioned earlier, you could also just edit the table and type in the color name. 
Experiment with this as you like, and then you can close the fi le without saving changes and 
continue to the next section.
Exploring the Authoring Options
The Options button, located in the lower-left corner of the authoring dialog box, allows you to 
create and edit part numbers and member names for iParts. You will typically want to set these 
naming options before you begin adding rows to the iPart table so that as rows are added, they 
are automatically named according to these options.
Notice the disk symbol located in the Member column header in Figure 7.9. This indicates 
that the Member column will be used as the fi lename for each iPart member. If you prefer to 
have the Part Number column used for the fi lenames, you can right-click that column header 
and select File Name Column.

338 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Figure 7.9
Member column 
used for ﬁ lename
A Member Name value is automatically created for each member as rows are added based on 
the settings for the part number and member name options. You can override these by editing 
the table in Excel, and you can even use a formula to create the names based on a concatenation 
of other column values in the table.
Generating Member Files
Once your iPart table is complete, you may want to generate the parts from the table. You can do 
this so the parts are established ahead of time, or you can allow the fi les to be generated auto-
matically as they are used. If you have an iPart table with two dozen rows, it might make sense 
to generate them ahead of time. However, if you have an iPart table of 200 member rows, then 
it might make sense to allow parts to be generated only when, for example, a particular size is 
used. To generate member part fi les, right-click the table and choose Generate Members. Each 
member in the row will be created as a derived part based on the table values.
iPart Member File Save Locations
Because these parts are often used over and over in many assemblies, I recommend that you 
store them in a library folder. Recall that folders designated as libraries in your project fi le are 
handled as read-only by Inventor. The library directory where you want to save the iPart 
members is set up by you, and it is required that you use the same name as the factory library 
but preceded with an underscore. As an example, if you place the iPart factory fi le in a library 
folder named Fasteners, Inventor will automatically place all iPart members generated from 
that factory part in a second library folder named _Fasteners.
However, you are not required to store iParts in libraries. If you do not use libraries and you 
place an iPart member into an assembly or use the Generate Members option, Inventor will 
create a folder of the same name, and at the same level as the iPart factory, and store the iPart 
members there. For example, if you have an iPart factory fi le named ClipBracket.ipt saved at 
C:\Mastering Inventor\, then when ClipBracket.ipt is used in an assembly, a subdirectory 
called ClipBracket is created (C:\Mastering Inventor\ClipBracket), and the iPart member 
fi le is created there. Custom iPart members are always stored in a location specifi ed by the user.
Creating Custom iParts
A custom iPart is an iPart factory that has one or more columns designated as a custom param-
eter column. A custom parameter column allows input of any value and, in turn, generates a 

WORKING WITH IPARTS | 339
custom iPart with infi nite variations. Custom iParts are valuable for creating tube and pipe 
lengths, structural steel members, and other parts that require unique size input at the time of 
insertion. To designate a column as a custom parameter column, simply right-click the column 
and select Custom Parameter Column. Columns that are set as keys are not permitted to be 
custom columns.
Rather than setting an entire column to be custom, you may want to set only the column 
entry for a single member to be custom. To do this, you can right-click any cell in a nonkey 
column and choose Custom Parameter Cell. Once cells or columns are designated as custom, 
you can right-click and set both columns and cells to restrict input to a specifi ed range and 
increment.
Here is a common example of setting a range for a custom part:
 
1. Right-click the column to set the Length column to be custom (it cannot be a key column).
 
2. Right-click the column to set the range so the part can be placed only in lengths from 25 
mm to 150 mm.
 
3. Right-click the column to set the increment to 5 mm so the lengths are limited to stan-
dard sizes within that range.
 
4. When the custom iPart is placed into an assembly, the size is then specifi ed.
 
5. Unlike standard iParts, custom iParts are saved to a location of your choice at the time of 
placement.
Figure 7.10 shows the options for creating a custom column.

Testing the iPart
Before placing a completed iPart into production for others to use, test the accuracy and inter-
face of your part by inserting the iPart using Place Component within a blank assembly fi le. 
Using Place Component, insert every member in the table and inspect and/or measure the 
placed component.
Moving the test forward, create an IDW fi le with a base view of your assembly. You will also 
need to generate a parts list with the desired columns and verify the accuracy of each cell. Once 
you are assured of having accurate member components, you can place this iPart into a project 

340 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
library folder or other location to be used in production. If using this iPart in conjunction with 
the functional-design features of Inventor, you will need to publish the factory iPart to a cus-
tom Content Center library. Publishing to Content Center is covered in more depth later in this 
chapter.
No Zero-Value Dimensions
You should not attempt to create a zero-value dimension as a method of suppressing features. Zero-
value dimensions can create unpredictable results when the zero value is set back to some value 
greater than zero. Often the dimension will solve in the wrong direction, causing feature proﬁ les 
to become invalid and create errors within your iPart. It is better to create a column to suppress 
individual features, rather than attempt to do so through dimensions.
Editing the iPart Factory
Editing an original iPart factory follows the same workfl ow as creating an iPart. If you’ve placed 
the original iPart factory into a project library folder, you will not be able to edit it within that 
same project. Instead, you should create a new project fi le for the purpose of editing library 
parts. When creating a new project fi le, you can either defi ne the workspace for the project fi le 
by placing the project fi le in the library subfolder or just duplicate your original project fi le and 
remove the library paths using the Project Editor dialog box. Any fi les within the library path 
will now be editable with this specifi c project fi le.
With the new Library Edit project fi le active, open the iPart you want to edit. Locate the table 
in the Model browser and either double-click or right-click to activate the iPart Author dialog 
box. At this point, you can edit any part of the table. When you have completed your editing, 
you can save the part to its original location.
Can’t Generate iPart Members?
When changes are made to an iPart factory and they impact existing iPart members, you should 
be able to use the Generate Files option to replace the iPart members (provided the folder or ﬁ les 
are not set as read-only by Windows). However, sometimes you’ll ﬁ nd that Inventor won’t generate 
new versions of existing iPart members once edits are made, even when you right-click them in the 
table and choose Generate Files and have checked the read-only status. Although the reason for this 
behavior is often unclear, you can generally get around it by browsing to the location of the iPart 
members and deleting them. Th en you can return to the iPart Factory and choose Generate Files.

WORKING WITH IPARTS | 341
You can convert an iPart factory component into a standard parametric part by deleting the 
table attached to the iPart. Simply right-click the table in the Model browser and select Delete. 
The part will revert to a parametric part with no history of the iPart functionality.
Using iParts in Designs
Using an iPart in an assembly design is a bit different from creating parts within an assembly. To 
place an iPart member of a particular size into an assembly, you will use the Place Component 
tool to browse and place the iPart factory. Upon placing the iPart factory into the assembly, you’ll 
be presented with the Place iPart dialog box, from which you can specify the member or choose 
from the keys you set previously. Keep in mind that if you didn’t set any keys in the iPart table, 
all of the columns will be listed in the Keys tab of the Place Standard iPart dialog box. Figure 7.11 
shows the placement of an iPart that has three keys set.
Figure 7.11
Placing an iPart 
into an assembly
In Figure 7.11 Length is Key 1, Width is Key 2, and Height is Key 3. Keep in mind that for 
the best results keys should be set from top to bottom in the Place iPart dialog box because the 
values are fi ltered in that order. However, Inventor does not prevent you from setting Key 3 fi rst 
and then Key 1. But working out of order with keys can create some confusion and unexpected 
results in the values you see listed in the drop-downs.
Once an iPart is placed, you might fi nd that you need to change to another size, color, or con-
fi guration. To change between iPart members, follow these steps:
 
1. Locate and expand the iPart in the assembly browser tree.
 
2. Right-click the table.
 
3. Choose Change Component.
This opens the iPart placement dialog box, which allows you to specify a new member to be 
used in place of the existing one. Figure 7.12 shows the specifi c selection path for changing the 
component. This replacement procedure will replace only the selected component instance.

342 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Figure 7.12
Changing the 
component
If you want to replace all exact duplicate members of the iPart within this assembly, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click the part within the graphics window or the Model browser.
 
2. Select Component.
 
3. Choose Replace All. A dialog box appears, allowing you to select the original iPart 
factory.
 
4. Once the original iPart factory is selected, you will be prompted with the iPart placement 
dialog box to allow you to select the specifi c member to be used as the replacement.
When a component is replaced with a different member of the same family, as with iParts, 
normally all Assembly constraints will be retained. If the replaced component is of a different 
family, the Assembly constraints might be broken. The same is true of parts in the same family 
if the original part used a certain feature to constrain to and the replacement part has that fea-
ture suppressed.
iPart Factories in Assemblies
You should be aware that Inventor does not allow an iPart factory ﬁ le to be placed into an assembly. 
If you attempt to do so, only a member of the factory will be placed instead. However, keep in mind 
that if you create a regular part ﬁ le, place it into an assembly, and then turn it into an iPart factory, 
changing the factory table does not place a member ﬁ le but simply updates the factory. Using fac-
tory ﬁ les in assemblies in this manner is not the intended workﬂ ow for iParts.
iFeatures are features that have been extracted from an existing part ﬁ le and conﬁ gured for reuse 
in other parts. If you are familiar with Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, you might relate iFeatures to 
blocks, in that you can write out blocks for reuse in other drawings. Any feature based on a sketch 
can be used as an iFeature, but there are some best practices to follow when creating sketches and 
features to be extracted for iFeatures. Once extracted, the iFeature is stored in an external location 
and can be placed into any other part ﬁ le. Inventor is supplied with a number of standard iFeature 
ﬁ les as well. iFeatures cannot currently be published to Content Center.

Working with iFeatures
Using iFeatures in your designs can greatly simplify your workfl ow and accelerate productivity, 
especially if your designs contain repetitive features. Figure 7.13 shows an example of a sheet-
metal part that could be created quickly using iFeatures.
Figure 7.13
Sheet-metal part 
with iFeatures
iFeatures used in sheet-metal parts are authored with center points that allow them to be 
placed as sheet-metal punches. iFeatures are stored in a Catalog folder defi ned in the Inventor 
application options. By default, the catalog is located in the Inventor install directory, but you 
can customize the location by selecting the Tools tab, clicking Application Options, and then 
choosing the iFeatures tab. On the iFeatures tab, you can set the catalog path to a directory of 
your choosing, most often located on a network server. You can create additional subfolders 
in the Catalog folder as required to better organize your iFeatures. Extracted iFeatures are 
saved with .ide fi lename extensions. iFeatures are also available online from such locations as 
http://cbliss.com. Often these online fi les contain the extracted iFeature and the original fi le 
it was created from. These can serve as good examples of how to set up complex geometry for 
iFeature extraction.
The following are some tips for working with iFeatures:
 
◆
Keep your iFeatures clean, and do not include projected geometry or reference geometry 
unless required.
 
◆
If dependent geometry is required, have it dependent only on geometry within the 
iFeature.
 
◆
You should avoid the use of origin work planes, axes, and the origin center point for work 
features.
 
◆
Use parallel and perpendicular constraints to other geometry in the iFeature rather than 
horizontal and vertical constraints.
 
◆
Know that updating table-driven iFeatures does not update existing instances of the 
iFeature.
 
◆
Save iFeatures before placing them in other parts.
Creating iFeatures
Once you have a part that consists of a feature or features that you want to reuse in the design 
of other parts, you can easily extract those features and place them into the catalog. The chief 

344 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
advantage of using iFeatures is that the original part does not need to be open in order to copy 
the feature. In addition, you can alter any of the parameters at will when inserting the feature 
into a new part.
To extract a part feature or features, go to the Manage tab and click the Extract iFeature but-
ton on the Author panel. Select the feature to be extracted, from either the Model browser or the 
graphics window. If additional features exist that are dependent on the selected feature, they 
will be included in the feature selection as well but can then be removed during the iFeature 
creation process if not needed.
Recall that a feature is dependent on another feature if it uses the other feature as a refer-
ence in the sketch or feature creation. For instance, if you created a sketch on the face of an 
Extrude feature, that sketch (and any feature created from that sketch) is inherently depen-
dent on the base Extrude feature because it uses the face as a reference plane. Therefore, if you 
extracted the base Extrude feature, the dependent feature is automatically included, but it can 
be removed if not needed. Figure 7.14 illustrates how to remove a dependent feature (Fillet1) 
while creating an iFeature.
Figure 7.14
Removing a depen-
dent feature
A standard iFeature will typically require a profi le plane in order to position the geometry 
onto a new part. Named parameters and values involved in the selected feature are transferred 
from the existing part into the new iFeature. In Figure 7.15, notice that prompts will be added for 
each of the named parameters. You can edit the prompts as needed. You’ll also notice that range 
and list limits have been set for some of the parameters. This allows you to control the input for 
iFeatures by limiting them to a predefi ned list of sizes or a specifi ed range between sizes. When 
inserting this iFeature into a different part in the future, you will be prompted to enter new 
values for these parameters.
Figure 7.15
Parameters and 
prompts

WORKING WITH IFEATURES | 345
Placing an iFeature
To place an iFeature in a standard part (not a sheet-metal part), browse to the stored iFeature 
and select the face you want to use for placement. During the placement, you can adjust the 
rotation angle and size parameters. To see a simple example of how iFeatures are extracted and 
placed, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_017.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of the Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. On the Manage tab, click the Extract iFeature button.
 
4. In the Model browser, click Extrusion2 as the selected feature. The dialog box will be 
populated with the parameter information found in that feature.
 
5. Click the parameter named E2_Ext_Ang and use the << button to remove it from the 
parameter list. This parameter is the taper angle of the extrusion, and by removing it 
from the list you are ensuring that users of iFeatures in the future cannot specify a taper.
Adjusting Extracted Features
In this case, the parameters have been renamed previously using the Parameters dialog box. 
However, you can adjust parameter names and the corresponding prompts at this point if needed.
You can also adjust the default values for the parameters without adjusting the current model, as 
well as add lists and ranges to each parameter using the Limits column.
 
6. For this example, accept the default for the rest of the parameters and click Save.
 
7. Notice that Inventor takes you straight to the Catalog folder. This location is specifi ed 
in the Application Options dialog box on the iFeature tab and can be changed if needed. 
Use the list of Frequently Used Subfolders on the left of the Save As dialog box to go to 
the Chapter 07 folder and name this iFeature SquareSocket.ide. Click the Save button 
to save the fi le.
 
8. Next, you’ll place the iFeature back into the model as a test. On the Manage tab, select the 
Insert iFeature tool.
 
9. Click the Browse button to go to the Chapter 07 folder.
 
10. Locate and select the SquareSocket feature you just created (or use the fi le called 
mi_7a_025.ide) and click the Open button.
 
11. Select the top face of Extrusion1 to use as the profi le plane.
 
12. Once the plane is selected, set the angle to 45 degrees, use the fl ip arrow to ensure that 
the feature is placed in the correct direction, and then click Next.
 
13. Enter 20 mm for the E2_Circ_Dia parameter and then click the edit icon (it looks like a 
pencil), or click in the space below the Diameter row or on another row in the dialog box 
to set the row out of edit mode.

346 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
 
14. Click the Refresh button to see the diameter update on-screen. Note that if the diameter 
does not update, you probably did not click out of the Diameter row to set the edit as 
active. The refresh option is a bit picky in this way. Keep in mind, however, that the pre-
view does not need to be refreshed to build to the specifi ed value correctly.
 
15. Once the size parameter has been adjusted, as shown in Figure 7.16, click Next.
Figure 7.16
Inserting a simple 
iFeature
 
16. You will be presented with two options for placing the iFeature; choose Activate Sketch 
Edit Immediately, and then click Finish.
 
17. You will see that the iFeature sketch is set and ready to be edited and constrained into 
place so that it can’t be moved accidentally.
You’ll notice that there is some extra geometry included in the sketch. This geometry came 
from the original feature from which you extracted the iFeature.
It would have been the best practice to prep the sketch and remove this geometry from the 
sketch before extracting. However, in this case you were not instructed to do so in order to illus-
trate the presence of relic geometry at this point. It’s often a good idea to save a copy of your 
original part fi le and use it to clean up unwanted geometry before extracting iFeatures.
You can click the Finish Sketch button and close the fi le without saving changes.
Taking the Time to Constrain the Sketch
You should also notice that the sketch is currently underconstrained. In particular, it has no dimen-
sions or constraints holding it in position. You can place general dimensions into the sketch to 
anchor it in place. Also present is some relic geometry that originated from the sketch from which 
the iFeature was extracted. It is poor practice to extract iFeatures without cleaning them up ﬁ rst, 
so eliminate this stray geometry beforehand.
It is also good practice to create a separate part ﬁ le from which to generate an iFeature rather 
than attempting to use a part ﬁ le designed for production. You can copy the part features from a 
production part into your iFeature test part using one of the copy or cloning methods discussed 
in the upcoming pages.

WORKING WITH IFEATURES | 347
Editing an iFeature File
Once iFeature (IDE) fi les have been extracted and tested, you can open them in Inventor and 
edit them much as you do iParts. Follow these steps to explore the options involved in editing 
an iFeature:
 
1. Select the Get Started tab, click the Open button, and then browse for the Chapter 07 
directory in your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Locate and open the fi le SquareSocket.ide you created in the previous exercise. If you 
did not complete that exercise, you can use the fi le mi_7a_025.ide in the Chapter 07 
directory.
Continue exploring the iFeature edit tools by following these general instructions:
 
◆
Use the Edit iFeature icon to refi ne parameter names, sizes, and instructional prompts for 
the placement of iFeatures.
 
◆
If the iFeature has dependent features, you can edit them as well.
 
◆
You can rename the iFeature if you want to confi gure it in a more in-depth manner by 
using the iFeature Author Table dialog box.
 
◆
The iFeature Author Table dialog box allows a table to be added to the iFeature so that rows 
and columns can be added to confi gure the iFeature in the same way you confi gured a part 
fi le using the iPart Author dialog box.
 
◆
Once you’ve added the table to the iFeature, you can further edit it by clicking the Edit 
Using Spread Sheet icon to open the table in Microsoft Excel.
When creating iFeatures, you’ll fi nd it a good idea to keep the original IPT fi le that you used 
to create the IDE fi le. This fi le is often useful in case you want to totally redesign the iFeature or 
make a similar iFeature.
Creating Punch Features
Punch features are really just iFeatures with extended functions that are slightly different in 
behavior from standard iFeatures. Punch features must have a single sketch center point in the 
base sketch to be extracted. The sketch center point will be used to locate the punch feature 
upon insertion into sheet-metal parts. The destination parts will require an active sketch con-
taining sketch center points for the location of the punch feature. It is the center point in the 
iFeature punch and the center point in the placement sketch that allow punch features to be 
precisely placed and constrained beyond the capabilities of the standard iFeature.
Including Placement Instructions
You can embed an instructional document detailing the placement selection requirements for more 
complex shapes that require faces to be selected in a certain order or need more information about 
size and settings. Here are the steps for including placement instructions:
 1. On the Tools tab, click Insert Object.
 2. Select Create From File, browse for the precreated instruction ﬁ le, and then click the OK button.

 4. Right-click the embedded object and select Placement Help to allow this ﬁ le to be accessed from 
the feature’s dialog box during placement.
Punch Features in Standard Non-Sheet-Metal Parts?
Although the Punch tool is not available for use in the standard part-modeling environment, you 
may have a need to quickly and precisely place a feature multiple times in a way that lends itself 
to the Punch tool.
To do this, you can use the Convert To Sheet Metal Part button (on the Model tab) to temporarily 
convert the part to a sheet-metal part. Once this is done, you can use the Punch tool as required.
After you’ve placed the punches, you can use the Convert To Standard Part button (found in the 
Setup drop-down of the Sheet Metal tab) to convert the part back. Th is will leave some relic sheet-
metal parameters in your part ﬁ le, but that shouldn’t cause an issue.
Creating Punch Features
When creating a punch feature, consider that in normal use most features extend through the 
thickness of the sheet metal. Therefore, it is important to use the Thickness parameter when 
creating the iFeature. Constructed properly, the punch feature will adjust to the thickness of any 
sheet-metal part to which it is applied.
The part used in the following steps is a simple sheet-metal part with one cut feature. 
Figure 7.17 shows the sketch underlying the cut feature. The sketch was created utilizing a

single center point, which will be used for placement when inserting the punch feature. There 
was no need to anchor the sketch since it was created for the sole purpose of extracting a punch 
iFeature.

Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_027.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. On the Manage tab, select the Extract iFeature tool (you’ll fi nd it on the Author panel).
 
4. Select Cut1 in the Model browser.
 
5. Click the radio button at the top of the dialog box to toggle the iFeature type from 
Standard iFeature to Sheet-Metal Punch iFeature.
Punches and Center Points
If you have created multiple center-point locations within your sketch, you will receive an error 
message when trying to create the punch feature. Recall that by using the Center Point icon next 
to the Construction icon, you can switch extra center points in your sketch to standard points so 
that they will not interfere. In this example, you have only one center point within the sketch, even 
though there are other points locating two of the circles on the ellipse. Th e others have been made 
standard points as described ahead of time.
 
6. Under the Manufacturing area, specify the punch ID as K775. Although not required, if 
it’s included, this punch ID can be retrieved and placed onto a drawing in the form of a 
punch note or punch table so the shop fl oor will know which punch to use.
 
7. Click the Select Sketch button for Simplifi ed Representation and then click Sketch3 in the 
Model browser. Simplifi ed sketches are optional but may help represent complex sketches 
more cleanly in the detail drawing.
 
8. When your dialog box resembles Figure 7.18, click Save, and select the Punches folder in 
the Chapter 07 folder of your Mastering Inventor 2015 directory.

iFeatures Are Powerful Tools
Th ese tools allow you to quickly create standard features in your models. Examples include o-ring 
grooves, louvers, bosses, ribs, electrical connector punches, patterns of holes, and an inﬁ nite num-
ber of other features. Another major advantage of iFeatures is that they enforce standards. Since 
the iFeature can be designed to allow the user to select predeﬁ ned sizes only, the possibility of 
error is greatly reduced. Take a few moments to examine your designs, and you’ll likely see many 
opportunities for iFeatures.
Placing a Sheet-Metal Punch Feature
When working on a sheet-metal part, you can access iFeatures through the Punch tool or the 
Insert iFeature button on the Manage tab. The Punch tool is optimized for sheet-metal parts, so 
unless you are placing a regular iFeature, you should always use the Punch tool. Prior to placing 
a feature, you must have an unconsumed, visible sketch containing one or more center points 
from which the punch will position itself. Follow these steps to place a sheet-metal punch:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_029.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.

WORKING WITH IFEATURES | 351
 
3. Inspect the Model browser to see that Sketch2 is visible. This sketch has been prepared 
for you to use in placing your new punch feature on the three center points.
 
4. Next, locate and select the Punch Tool button on the Sheet Metal tab.
 
5. Select the K775.ide fi le you created in the previous exercise from the Punches folder and 
click the Open button. (If you did not complete the previous exercise, you can browse to 
the Punches folder of the Chapter 07 directory and choose the fi le called K777.ide.) You 
will notice that every unconsumed center point within the sketch will be populated with 
the selected punch.
Center Points
If you want to reserve a sketch center point for some other feature, click the Geometry tab in the 
Punch Tool dialog box and hold down the Ctrl key while selecting the center point to be removed. 
If you want to place only one center point, hold down the Ctrl key, click the sketch away from a 
center point, and then click the center point where you want the punch. If you have more than one 
visible, unconsumed sketch, the center points will not be automatically selected because you will 
need to tell Inventor which sketch to use.
 
6. Click the Geometry tab and set the angle to 90.
 
7. Click the Size tab and set InsertDia to 20 mm, Major to 50 mm, and Minor to 25 mm.
 
8. Click the Edit icon (it looks like a pencil) or click in the space below the Diameter row or 
on another row in the dialog box to set the row out of edit mode.
 
9. Click the Refresh button to see the diameter update on-screen. Note that if the diameter 
does not update, you probably did not click out of the Diameter row to set the edit as 
active. The refresh option is a bit picky in this way. Keep in mind, however, that the pre-
view does not need to be refreshed to build to the specifi ed value correctly. Figure 7.19 
shows the punch parameters.

10. Click the Finish button to complete the punch action.
 
11. Click the Go To Flat Pattern button to view the fl at pattern.
 
12. Right-click the Flat Pattern node in the Model browser and choose Edit Flat Pattern 
Defi nition.
 
13. Click the Punch Representation tab, set the drop-down to 2D Sketch Rep And Center 
Mark, and then click the OK button. Note the simplifi ed version of the punches. This can 
be useful for placing grouped punches or helping to simplify drawings that have many 
punches on them.
Note that you could use the Insert iFeature option to place the punches, but you would not be 
offered the same placement options. Instead, its behavior would be similar to that of a standard 
iFeature, requiring constraint of the placed punch by anchoring it to the base feature. In general, 
it is best to use the Punch tool for sheet-metal parts rather than placing punches as a standard 
iFeature.
Note that whereas the iFeature tool is available in the standard and sheet-metal environ-
ments, the Punch tool is available only in the sheet-metal environment. You can close this fi le 
without saving changes when you have fi nished.
Reusing Existing Geometry
Geometry reuse is a productive technique in Inventor. You can reuse existing features and 
sketch geometry to create additional features within the same part or even on other open parts. 
You don’t need to create additional new sketches to utilize this technique. The following sec-
tions show how to copy sketches and features and develop dependent and independent relation-
ships between the features.
Copying Features
Copying features in Inventor is a relatively simple procedure using the Model browser. In an 
existing model, simply right-click a feature within the browser and select Copy. Next, select a 
different face within the model, right-click, and select Paste. Figure 7.20 shows a preview of the 
placement and the Paste Features dialog box.
Figure 7.20

REUSING EXISTING GEOMETRY | 353
Beware of Projected Loops
When you select a face with the Project Geometry tool rather than selecting individual edges, 
a projected loop is created. If you select an edge, a projected edge is created. It is important to 
understand that when you right-click a feature that is based on projected loops, you will not get 
an option to copy it.
To resolve this, you can locate the projected loop by expanding the Sketch node in the browser 
and then right-clicking it and choosing Break Link. Once you break the link of the projected loop, 
you can copy the sketch. When you select just an edge to project, rather than a face, the result is a 
projected edge. Projected edges can be copied without breaking the link. But if you have the need 
to break the link of a projected edge, you can do so by right-clicking it in the graphics area and 
choosing Break Link.
There are two questions to consider when copying a feature:
 
◆
What should Inventor do with features that are built based on the feature you are copying?
 
◆
What should Inventor do with the dimensions for your new feature?
You’ll explore the features fi rst.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_031.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Right-click Extrusion2 in the Model browser, and notice that there is no Copy option. 
This is because there is a projected loop present in the sketch.
 
4. Choose Edit Sketch from the context menu.
 
5. Expand the Sketch2 node in the browser and notice the projected loop. This was created 
when the face the sketch is on was projected into the sketch.
 
6. Right-click the Projected Loop node and choose Break Link.
Now that the link from the loop to the face is broken, the sketch is underconstrained. In 
real life, you’d take the time to reconstrain the sketch so that future changes to the base 
feature would not upset Sketch2 or Feature2. Most likely you’d do this by deleting the 
projected outer lines and reapplying the 20 mm dimensions to the projected edges of the 
base feature. For this exercise, though, you can leave the sketch underconstrained.
 
7. Click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch.
 
8. Right-click Extrusion2 in the Model browser and choose Copy.
 
9. Right-click anywhere in the blank space of the graphics area and choose Paste.
 
10. Drag your cursor over any face of the part, and you will see a preview of the copied 
feature.

11. In the Paste Features dialog box, set the Paste Features drop-down to Dependent, and you 
will notice that the fi llets are now in the preview as well because they are dependents of 
Extrusion2.
 
12. Click the front face of the part to position the new feature, as shown in Figure 7.20.
 
13. Use the plus sign–shaped arrows in the center of the copied feature to move the feature 
around the selected face.
 
14. Use the C-shaped arrow to rotate the new feature, and notice that the rotation angle is 
refl ected in the dialog box and can be adjusted there as well.
By default, the dimensions of the new feature will be independent, meaning that 
because the original feature has a width of 25 mm, the new feature will have the same 
value, but the two will not be linked. However, if you set the Parameter drop-down to 
Dependent, the dimensions of the new feature will reference the original feature so that 
if the original width changes from 25 mm to 35 mm, the new feature follows.
 
15. Set the Parameter drop-down to Dependent also and then click Finish.
 
16. Locate and edit Sketch2 in Extrusion2 and set the diameter dimension to 6 mm.
 
17. Finish the sketch, and notice that the new feature follows the edits of the original.
Once you’ve copied the feature, you should edit the copied feature sketch to properly anchor 
the sketch on the destination face. When editing a dependent sketch, notice that the dimensions 
indicate that they are being driven by a parameter from the original feature. If you change the 
dimensions from a parameter value to a numeric value, you will break the dependency with the 
original sketch. You can close this fi le without saving changes, or you can leave it open to exper-
iment with cloning a feature from one part to another part in the next section.
Cloning
Cloning is the process of copying feature geometry from one open part to another. The cloning 
process creates independent features, meaning that the new feature in the new part will have no 
relationship to the original feature in the original part unless set up manually.
To clone a feature from one part to another, you must fi rst have both parts open in Inventor. 
Here are the general steps:
 
1. From the source part, right-click the feature to be copied in the Model browser and 
choose Copy.
 
2. Switch to the destination part, right-click anywhere and choose Paste.
 
3. Drag your cursor over the face of the part you want to paste onto, and you will see a 
preview of the copied feature.
 
4. Click the face and then click Finish when the part is positioned to your liking.
The primary difference between copying features within the same part and cloning features 
between two parts is that parameters can be set to be independent only during the cloning 
process.

REUSING EXISTING GEOMETRY | 355
It will be necessary to fully constrain and anchor the feature sketch to the new part once the 
feature has been copied. To accomplish this, simply edit the new feature sketch and project con-
struction geometry from the new part base feature to serve as anchor points.
Linking Parameters Between Two Files
You can establish a relationship between two parts, between two assemblies, or between a part 
and an assembly by linking the fi les’ parameters. This can allow you to place all the design 
information in one fi le and link other fi les to it so the intent of the design is maintained. Here 
are the steps to do this:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_033.iam from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
This is a simple pin and plate assembly. Your goal is to link the shaft diameter of the 
pin to the hole diameter in the plate. To do this, you will fi rst edit the pin part called 
mi_7a_034.ipt.
 
3. Select mi_7a_034.ipt from the browser, right-click, and choose Edit (or just double-click 
the pin in the graphics area).
 
4. Once the part is active for edits, click the Parameters button on the Manage tab.
 
5. At the bottom of the Parameters dialog box, click the Link button, as shown on the left of 
Figure 7.21.
Figure 7.21
Linking parameters
 
6. Adjust the Files Of Type drop-down to show Inventor Files; then open the fi le 
mi_7a_035.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 
folder and click the Open button.
 
7. This opens the Link Parameter dialog box, allowing you to choose which parameters to 
link to this part. Click the button next to the parameter named Diameter and then click 
the OK button.
This will add the selected parameter to the user parameters in the pin part, making it 
available for you to reference in another parameter.

8. Locate Shaft_Diameter in the list, activate the cell in the Equation column, and clear the 
existing value.
 
9. Click the fl yout arrow, as shown in Figure 7.22, and choose List Parameters from the fl y-
out menu.
Figure 7.22
Setting a param-
eter to reference a 
linked parameter
 
10. Select Diameter from the Parameters lists and then add - 1 mm so that your fi nal shaft 
diameter equation is Diameter - 1 mm. Subtracting 1 mm from the shaft diameter creates 
a loose hole.
 
11. Click Done at the bottom of the dialog box to return to the model.
 
12. Click the Update button from the Quick Access bar (at the top of the graphics area) to 
see the model update if needed. If you have the Immediate Update check box selected in 
the Parameters dialog box, the part updates right away, but the updates may need to be 
pushed up to the assembly.
 
13. Finally, right-click and choose Finish Edit to return to the assembly level.
Now the shaft diameter is linked to the hole diameter in the part called mi_7a_035.ipt. You 
can open or edit mi_7a_035.ipt and change the hole diameter value to see the change carry 
through to the shaft of the pin. Linking parameters in this way allows you to place design infor-
mation in one location and pull it into many other parts for automatic updates.
Copying Sketches
Quite often it is desirable to copy existing part sketches to another location within the same part 
or a different part. A good example of this would be creating a loft feature where each profi le 
sketch may simply change size.
In the example shown in Figure 7.23, the part contains one unconsumed sketch and multiple 
work planes parallel to the XY origin plane. To copy an existing sketch, simply right-click the 
target sketch and select Copy. Then select the destination work plane, right-click, and select 
Paste. Pasted sketches are always independent of the original sketch and will create additional 
parameters for each copy.

REUSING EXISTING GEOMETRY | 357
Figure 7.23
Copying a sketch
The following exercise will explore copying sketches:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_039.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of the Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Right-click Sketch1 in the Model browser and choose Copy.
 
4. Click any edge of the work plane closest to the sketch and then right-click and 
choose Paste.
 
5. Repeat this for each of the remaining work planes.
 
6. Select the 20 mm dimension in each of the copied sketches and adjust the minor axis on 
each of the sketches, decreasing the dimension value by 4 mm on each subsequent sketch, 
as shown in Figure 7.23.
 
7. Edit Rectangular Pattern1 and change the pattern count to 6.
 
8. Right-click any edge of the new work plane and choose New Sketch.
 
9. If it’s not done automatically, project the origin center point to the sketch. You can use the 
Project Geometry tool on the Sketch tab and select the center point of the ellipse in any of 
the other sketches.
As you can see, copying sketches can be a quick way to duplicate repetitive geometry. To 
carry this thought through, you can create a loft utilizing all the sketches, including the sketch 
consisting of just the projected origin point. Apply a tangent condition to the projected point to 
achieve a result that holds the work plane as the extent of the loft.
In this example, you copied a sketch within the same part. The procedure to copy an 
existing sketch to another part requires that both parts be open at the same time. Right-click 
the original sketch and then select Copy. Then, after selecting the destination part work plane 
or part face in the second fi le, right-click and select Paste.

358 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Once the sketches are pasted, they can be edited at any time by adding additional geometry, 
changing dimensions, or simply using the pasted geometry for reference.
Using Flip Normal
At times you may ﬁ nd that your sketch “ﬂ ips” when you’re pasting it onto a work plane. In many 
cases, you can easily ﬁ x this by right-clicking the work plane and selecting Flip Normal. Th is ﬂ ips 
the positive axis of the work plane. Th en when you paste the sketch onto the work plane, it will 
no longer be ﬂ ipped.
Introducing Content Center
In Inventor 2015, Content Center is available in two forms: Desktop Content and the tradi-
tional Autodesk Data Management Server (ADMS)–based Content Center. The ADMS-based 
Content Center is a set of database libraries contained in Microsoft SQL and is generally used 
when sharing a central customized Content Center over a network. The other is a stand-alone 
install of Content Center that typically resides on your local machine. The stand-alone install 
is the default form of Content Center. No matter how you choose to install Content Center, you 
can select which libraries to use. These libraries provide standard content in several common 
international standards, such as ANSI, ISO, and DIN, just to name a few. Figure 7.24 shows the 
complete list. Once properly confi gured and populated, Content Center provides an organized 
method for part and feature reuse.
Figure 7.24
Content Center 
libraries
You can think of these libraries simply as recipes for creating parts because no actual part 
fi les exist in the Content Center fi le store. Instead, Content Center is a table of part parameters 
stored in the Content Center database. Once these library databases are installed, you can access 
them from Inventor and place common parts into your designs.

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 359
Understand that it is at this point the Content Center part fi le is created. Up until this point, 
the part existed only as a defi nition in the database table. If you work in a shared environment, 
the Content Center part fi les might typically be stored on a network server so that as users col-
laborate on designs, they have access to the same part fi les used within the assemblies. Because 
the Content Center library database fi les are just defi nitions of the fi les, they can be installed on 
the users’ local machines or on a network server, or both.
Content Center provides support for functional design using the design accelerator, Frame 
Generator, and other features within Inventor. When you’re using these tools, the parts gener-
ated are pulled from the Content Center libraries. You can use Content Center in conjunction 
with standard iParts and iFeatures organized within libraries in the project.
Conﬁ guring Content Center
Content Center, loaded with all the standard libraries, provides in excess of 800,000 variations in 
parts. To optimize loading, you will want to confi gure only the appropriate standards for your 
use. Installing all libraries will cause Inventor to take more time to search and index the data. 
There are two installation strategies for Content Center. Depending on how you work, you may 
want to install the desktop Content Center or the ADMS version.
Installing Content Center for a Stand-Alone User
If you work as a stand-alone user, I recommend you use the Desktop Content method. No server 
setup or login is required because the Content Center libraries are installed in the Libraries 
folder, at a path similar to C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Content Center\
Libraries\. You can insert the install media and install or reinstall the Content Center librar-
ies at any point by following the installation steps. Once the libraries are installed, you use the 
Place From Content Center tool or the Open From Content Center tool to access the Content 
Center libraries.
Installing Content Center for a Collaborative Environment
If working in a shared group, you will likely want to install Content Center on a server location 
instead of, or in addition to, the Desktop Content libraries. When installing on a server, you will 
install the libraries on the Autodesk Data Management Server. The ADMS is essentially just the 
interface with which you interact with the SQL database program. Once the ADMS is installed 
and the required Content Center libraries are loaded, users log into the ADMS through Inventor.
When deciding whether to install Content Center libraries on a network server or install 
them locally, consider whether you plan to create and use a custom library. If not, you may not 
need to install Content Center on a server, and you can choose to install the libraries on all the 
local machines only. Because the standard Content Center libraries are all read-only databases, 
they cannot become out of sync; therefore, two users can access two different instances of the 
standard libraries and work without issue. If you plan to create custom Content Center librar-
ies, however, I recommend you install on a network server so that as the library is updated over 
time, all users are pulling from the same source. You can consult the installation media for more 
information on installing the ADMS and the Content Center libraries.

360 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Desktop Content vs. ADMS Content Center Libraries 
If both the Desktop Content and the ADMS Content Center libraries are installed, then the cur-
rent radio button selection under the Access options found by going to the Tools tab, clicking the 
Application Options button, and selecting the Content Center tab will control which is used. By 
default this is set to Inventor Desktop Content and will need to be changed to Autodesk Vault Server 
if the ADMS Content Center libraries are installed and are intended to be used.
Managing Your Memory Footprint
Installing all libraries into the ADMS will increase your overall memory usage substantially. 
As mentioned earlier, installing only the libraries you use will keep Content Center effi cient. As 
you will see in the coming pages, you can create a custom Content Center library based on the 
standard libraries and include only what you require. Once the custom library is created, stan-
dard libraries can be removed from the ADMS. You can add them back at any time by reinstall-
ing them from the Inventor installation disks.
Configuring Content Center Libraries in the Project Files
Once you’ve installed the ADMS and the required libraries, you will need to confi gure the 
project fi le to ensure that all required libraries are included in the project. To do this, you will 
want to close all fi les in Inventor so that the project fi le can be edited. Then follow these steps:
 
1. In Inventor, select the Get Started tab and click the Projects button.
 
2. In the Project Editor dialog box, ensure that your project is set as active and click the 
Confi gure Content Center Libraries button at the lower right of the Projects dialog box to 
open the Confi gure Libraries dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.25.
Figure 7.25
Conﬁ guring 
Content Center 
libraries

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 361
 
3. Use the buttons at the bottom of the dialog box to update, import, add, or remove libraries 
for the project. Removing libraries from a project will speed up the interaction between 
Inventor and Content Center when placing a part because fewer library tables are 
required to be read, searched, and indexed. Once a library is removed, you can add it to 
the project again at any time.
If you only occasionally access a certain library because you typically do not work with that 
standard, you might install it but remove it from your Inventor project. When you do need to 
access this library, use the Confi gure Libraries dialog box to load it for use and then unload it 
once you have fi nished. Although the suggestion to add and remove libraries may seem like a 
hassle, it will pay off in time savings because you will not fi nd yourself waiting for the libraries 
to load every time you access Content Center.
Using Content Center
Content Center is used in many areas of Inventor. Components from Content Center are used 
in functional-design tools, such as the Shaft Generator or Frame Generator, as well as in indi-
vidual, reusable components in general assembly design. Content Center is also available for use 
within the part environment using the Place Feature tool.
Placing Components into an Assembly
Let’s take a closer look at placing components into an assembly from Content Center.
 
1. Make sure you have either Desktop Content or the ADMS installed and the ANSI content 
library loaded to continue with this example.
 
2. If you are running Content Center through the ADMS, ensure that you are logged in to 
the ADMS by clicking the Inventor icon and selecting Vault Server ➢ Content Center 
Log In.
If you are already logged in or logged into Vault, Log In will be grayed out and will not 
be an option in your menu.
 
3. Enter your login information, if known. By default, the ADMS installs with a user 
account called Administrator with no password set. You can also select the Content 
Center library’s Read-Only check box to access content without logging in.
 
4. Specify the name of the server on which you installed the ADMS. If you have installed 
the ADMS on your local machine, enter localhost. In the Database text box, enter the 
name of the ADMS database; the default is Vault.
Placing Parts from Content Center
Once logged in to the ADMS or if you have installed Desktop Content (there is no login 
required), you are ready to place parts from Content Center. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_044.iam from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.

362 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
 
3. On the Assemble tab, click the Place From Content Center icon. Check to see that the 
three buttons indicated in Figure 7.26 are selected. From left to right these buttons are 
Filters, AutoDrop, and Tree View:
Figure 7.26
Place From Content 
Center settings
Filters Button  Select ANSI to fi lter out all other standards. To turn the fi lter off after 
this exercise, click the Filters button again and deselect ANSI. If you do not have the 
ANSI library installed, you can select another library, but the size and bolt names will 
differ from the following steps.
AutoDrop Button  This button turns on the ability to automatically size components 
based on geometry in the model.
Tree View Button  This button splits the screen so that the Category View pane is acces-
sible on the left of the dialog box.
 
4. Select the Fasteners category in the left pane, browse to Bolts and then Round Head, 
select Cross Recessed Binding Head Machine Screw – Type I, and click the OK button.
 
5. In the model, zoom in to one of the caster wheel assemblies and take note of the 
empty holes.
 
6. Pause your mouse pointer over one of the holes on the castor plate.
You will see the AutoDrop icon activate and fl icker as Inventor indexes the database for 
an appropriate size. If no matching size can be found in the database, a cursor note will 
appear saying so. If an appropriate size is found, a cursor note will display it, and a 
preview of the part will be shown.
 
7. Once the size appears, click the edge of the hole to set the screw in place. The AutoDrop 
toolbar will appear along with the red grip arrow.
 
8. Drag the grip arrow up or down to specify the length of the screw. Note that only lengths 
found in the database are available.
 
9. Click the Apply button and continue placing screws as you see fi t. Experiment with plac-
ing the mouse pointer over one of the large diameters in the caster assembly to watch 
AutoDrop attempt to fi nd an appropriate size. Figure 7.27 shows the AutoDrop toolbar.

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 363
Figure 7.27
Placing a screw with 
AutoDrop
Once you’ve experimented with placing bolts from Content Center, you can close this fi le 
without saving changes or continue exploring the other options discussed. Here is a brief 
description of each of the tool icons shown in the AutoDrop toolbar in Figure 7.27:
Insert Multiple  The fi rst icon is available when Inventor identifi es multiple targets that are 
like the selected target. In this case, the other holes in the plate are picked up and previewed. 
If you apply the screw now, four screws will be placed at once. If you do not want the mul-
tiples to be placed, you can click the Insert Multiple icon to turn it off.
Change Size  The second icon is grayed out while Insert Multiple is on. It inserts the part 
and opens the Part Family dialog box, which allows you to edit the component.
Bolted Connection  The next icon opens the Bolted Connection Component Generator and 
allows you to place bolt, nut, and washer sets as a group.
Apply  The fourth icon sets the previewed components and allows you to continue placing 
more components of the same family.
Place  The last icon sets the components and exits the AutoDrop mode.
The AutoDrop toolbar is context-sensitive, so the icons may vary depending on the com-
ponent to be placed and the selected geometry. If you press F1 on the keyboard while the 
AutoDrop toolbar is displayed, Inventor will open the help fi le and list all the icons and their 
descriptions.
Now that you’ve placed Content Center components, let’s examine where Inventor is storing 
the newly generated Content Center fi les. Select the Tools tab, click Application Options, and 
then click the File tab. Look for the fi le path indicating the default Content Center fi les, as shown 
at the top of Figure 7.28.

364 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Figure 7.28
Content Center ﬁ les 
storage path
This is where Inventor will place all standard parts placed from Content Center by default. 
Typically you should change this path to a path that is on the network server, particularly if you’re 
working in a multiuser environment. If you work only on your local hard drive, you will still 
likely want to change the path to be similar to the path where you save your Inventor designs.
If this path is left at the default, Content Center part fi les will be saved on your local machine. 
This causes a problem when a co-worker opens an assembly you created. There is one more 
place where you can set this path, and that is in the project fi le under Folder Options, as shown 
at the bottom of Figure 7.28. It is important to note that a path set in the project fi le takes pre-
cedence over a path set in application options. If the project fi le is set as Content Center Files = 
[Default], then the fi les are stored at the application options path.
Only standard Content Center fi les are stored at this location. Custom-sized Content Center 
part fi les, such as standard steel shapes, pipes, and so on, are stored at a path chosen by you at 
the time of their creation.
Customizing Content Center Libraries
You should be aware of a few options customizing Content Center Libraries. You can ﬁ nd these 
settings on the Content Center tab of the Application Options dialog box.
Refresh Out-Of-Date Standard Parts During Placement  When this option is selected, 
existing standard part ﬁ les are automatically replaced with newer versions. For instance, if 
you update a standard part with your part number in the Content Center library tables but 
that part has already been placed in other assemblies and therefore already exists in the 
Content Center parts ﬁ le folder, having this option selected will update the Content Center 
ﬁ le folder and place the new version in the assemblies.
Custom Family Default  Set this option to place a custom Content Center part as a stan-
dard part. When you place a custom part as standard, the part ﬁ le is saved in the Content 
Center ﬁ les folder and is considered a standard part.
Access Options  Th is sets the source of the Content Center libraries. You can choose 
between Desktop Content and the ADMS/Vault server.
Standard Content Center libraries supplied with Inventor are designated as read-only and 
cannot be modifi ed. If you need to create custom part libraries or modify standard content such 

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 365
as adding part numbers or material types, you can do so by creating a custom Content Center 
library. Custom libraries are initially set as read/write libraries so that you can add and modify 
content.
Do You Need to Use Content Center?
Many people ﬁ nd the ﬁ le structure of Content Center–generated ﬁ les to be at odds with the way 
they store purchased and standard parts. If you ﬁ nd this is the case with your setup, you might 
want to use Content Center to generate parts but then save copies of them under your own ﬁ le 
structure as needed. Often, commonly used components are generated from Content Center in 
this manner and then placed in a company’s purchase part directory after the Part Number and 
Description iProperties are adjusted.
Creating Custom Libraries for ADMS Installs
You add libraries from the Autodesk Data Management Server console when using Content 
Center with the ADMS. You can access the ADMS by selecting Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk 
➢ Autodesk Data Management ➢ Autodesk Data Management Server Console. Typically this 
would be done on the server machine. Figure 7.29 shows how to create a custom library.
Figure 7.29
Creating a custom 
library in the ADMS
Once you’re logged into the ADMS console, expand the folder in the top of the left pane, 
right-click the Libraries subfolder, and select Create Library. Create a new library called 
Mastering Inventor.
Once the library is created, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Get Started tab.
 
2. Click the Projects button.
 
3. Click the Confi gure Content Center Libraries button at the bottom-right corner of the 
Project Editor dialog box.
 
4. Ensure that the In Use check box for this new library is selected so that the project is con-
fi gured to include it.

366 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Creating Custom Libraries for Desktop Content
You can create a custom Content Center library for Desktop Content through the Content Center 
confi guration of the Project Editor. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Get Started tab.
 
2. Click the Projects button.
 
3. Click the Confi gure Content Center Libraries button at the bottom-right corner of the 
Project Editor dialog box.
 
4. Click the Create Library button and enter Mastering Inventor into the input box, as 
shown in Figure 7.30.
Figure 7.30

tom library with

5. Click the OK button.
 
6. Ensure that the In Use check box for this new library is selected so that the project is con-
fi gured to include it.
Copying Existing Libraries into Custom Libraries
After creating a custom library, you can copy entire or partial contents of existing standard 
libraries into your custom library. You might use this process when you want to simplify one of 
the standard libraries, remove portions of the library that are not needed in your work environ-
ment, or edit component properties such as part numbers. Here are the steps to copy families to 
a custom library:
 
1. Access the Content Center Editor from within Inventor by selecting the Manage tab and 
clicking the Editor button on the Content Center panel. This editor looks similar to the 
Content Center dialog box.
 
2. Locate the library or the part family within a library that you want to copy, right-click, 
and choose Copy To ➢ Mastering Inventor, as shown in Figure 7.31.

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 367
Figure 7.31
Copying a Content 
Center family
The library must be included in the project fi le confi guration list in order to be visible within 
the editor. If you copy an entire library to your custom library, then the entire folder structure 
and contents will be replicated in your custom library. If you copy an individual part to your 
custom library, then only the affected category structure will be replicated in the custom library 
along with the copied part.
To copy only a portion of the category structure, browse to the last hierarchical portion of the 
structure that you want to replicate. Otherwise, starting from the top and copying the structure 
will replicate the entire structure.
Setting Category Properties
Each category within Content Center contains category properties. Within the category proper-
ties is general information regarding the category itself. The General tab contains the category 
name, category image, and source library.
Creating Multiple Material Types for Content Center Families
It’s pretty easy for your design department to have the Content Center parts reﬂ ect their own 
internal part numbers so that bills of materials and parts lists will extract this information auto-
matically. Doing this is as simple as copying the appropriate standard Content Center categories 
to a custom read/write library and editing the tables to include the new part numbers.
However, if multiple material types are used for the same component type, then multiple copies of 
the family can be made to accommodate this. For instance, if you use stainless steel fasteners of a 
given type for certain design instances and also use galvanized fasteners of the same type in other 
design instances, you would most likely need these to have separate part numbers.

You can use the Material Guide to add materials in one of three ways.
 
◆
You can edit a family table and select the members to add new materials to. Th en click the 
Material Guide button or right-click and choose Material Guide to copy the selected members, 
add them to the family table, and assign the new materials to them.
 
◆
You can use the Material Guide for an entire family, copying all members with a new material 
and adding them to the existing family. Select the family in the Content Center Editor and 
click the Material Guide button, or right-click and choose Material Guide. Th en choose the 
option called Add Materials As New Family Members, thereby copying all members into the 
same family table and setting a new material at the same time.
 
◆
You can create new families of a diﬀ erent material as well. Select the family in the Content 
Center Editor and click the Material Guide button, or right-click and choose Material Guide. 
Th en choose the option Create New Family For Each Material, thereby copying the entire exist-
ing family and setting a new material for this new family at the same time.
The Parameters tab contains parameters used within the category to assist in the description 
of parts located within that category. Figure 7.32 illustrates the parameter list in the ANSI Socket 
Head category.
Figure 7.32
Socket head 
parameters
Within these parameters, some are optional and some are required. If you are placing a part 
within this category, you must map your part properties to all required fi elds for proper opera-
tion. Optional fi elds do not require mapping.
Continued

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 369
What this means is that if you are planning on publishing a large number of your own parts 
to Content Center, your part parameters must match the category parameters. If you are unable 
to match the parameters, consider creating a new category.
Expect Some Inconsistency
Th e mapping required for Content Center is not consistent for all types of parts because of the evolu-
tion of these tools over time. Some of the categories require authoring before you can publish a part. 
Other categories are open for publishing without authoring. Th e requirements for restricted cat-
egories are driven by tools such as the design accelerator, Bolted Connection, and AutoDrop, which 
require certain parameters so they can intelligently place components. One inconsistency is Frame 
Generator. Since Content Center steel shapes predate Frame Generator, which originally had its 
own shape library, there weren’t any authoring requirements. Just be aware of the inconsistencies.
Right-clicking an individual Content Center part will allow you to view the family properties 
and mapping of that part. Compare the category parameters of the part with the parameters of 
the intended category. Matching the two parameter lists ensures that the part will map easily 
into that category.
Editing a Custom Content Center Family
A Content Center family is an individual part, similar to an iPart. The part consists of a stan-
dard factory part with a family table attached that generates any of the optional table values.
You can edit any individual part by fi rst switching the library view to your custom library 
designation, as shown in Figure 7.33.
Figure 7.33
Editing a Content 
Center part
In the previous example, you switched the library view to the Mastering Inventor custom 
library. Right-click a part located within the custom library and select Family Table. This 
launches a dialog box that allows the user to modify values, copy/paste, add/delete rows, or 
suppress existing rows within the table. The dialog box also allows the addition, deletion, and 
modifi cation of columns and properties.
Publishing Parts to Content Center
Developing a process for reusing parts within your company’s design environment is essential 
for standardization and improved productivity. Part of this process may include publishing 

370 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
existing Inventor parts stored in project libraries. Both normal parts and iParts can be published 
to a custom Content Center library.
The act of publishing a standard part into the custom library adds a family table to the pub-
lished part. Exported part parameters will be converted to table parameters when published to 
the custom Content Center. iPart tables are converted to family tables when published.
Preparing the Part for Publishing
If the part you intend to publish will be included in an existing Content Center family category 
(that is, fasteners, shaft parts, and so on), you can use the Component Authoring tool to prepare 
components with the necessary properties for use as “smart” content in the Content Center 
library. You can do this by following these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_7a_064.ipt from the Chapter 07 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Manage tab and click the Component Authoring button on the Author panel 
(you may need to use the drop-down to fi nd it).
 
4. From the drop-down list, select Fasteners ➢ Bolts and select Other. Note that the graphics 
and selection prompts change depending on the category of component selected.
 
5. Select the geometry for each row in the dialog box that corresponds to the dialog box 
graphic to map iMate placement to this part (iMates are preprogrammed Assembly 
constraints).
 
6. Click the Parameter Mapping tab. Note that the parameters listed in the light yellow/
orange rows are required, whereas the others are optional. Click the … button for the 
Grip Length row.
 
7. In the Part Template Parameters dialog box, expand the browser to fi nd Parameters ➢ 
User and select GripLength. This maps the part parameter to the corresponding family 
table parameter. Click the OK button.
 
8. Map the Nominal Diameter and the Nominal Length parameters to the NomDiameter 
and NomLength model parameters, respectively (you can fi nd these at Parameters ➢ 
Model rather than Parameters ➢ User).
 
9. Click the OK button to write the mapped parameters and iMates to the part fi le. You 
could also click the Publish Now button to start the publishing process.
You can author parts ahead of time and use the Batch Publish tool to publish one or more 
unopened parts at once. Or you can publish one part at a time, as covered in the next section. 
Figure 7.34 shows the Component Authoring dialog box tabs. You can close this part without 
saving changes and move on to the next section, which is about publishing parts.

INTRODUCING CONTENT CENTER | 371
Figure 7.34
Component 
Authoring tabs
Publishing the Part
To publish a part to Content Center, you must have a custom library with read/write capability 
created, and your current project fi le must be confi gured to include this custom library. In this 
example, you will publish a simple part that has already been authored to the custom read/write 
Content Center library called Mastering Inventor. If you haven’t already created this library, 
review the steps in the section “Creating Custom Libraries for Desktop Content” or “Creating 
Custom Libraries for ADMS Installs,” depending on which method applies to your setup. Follow 
these steps to publish a part:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_7a_068.ipt located in the Chapter 07 directory of the Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select the Manage tab and click the Publish Part button on the Content Center panel.
 
4. Select the Mastering Inventor library, and set the language as required; then click Next.
 
5. Ensure that Category To Publish To is set to Fasteners ➢ Bolts ➢ Other; then click Next.
 
6. Notice that most of the parameters are already mapped; this is because this part has 
previously been authored following the steps in the section “Preparing the Part for 
Publishing.” Recall that all parameters in the light yellow/orange rows are required. Click 
the … button for the Thread Type row.
 
7. In the Part Template Parameters dialog box, expand the browser to fi nd Threads ➢ 
Thread1, select Type, and then click the OK button.
 
8. Click Next in the Publish Guide dialog box.
 
9. Select Nominal Diameter, Nominal Length, and Part Number in the left pane and use 
the arrow button to include them in the right pane. This defi nes keys that are available 

372 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
for selection upon placement of the Content Center part once published. At least one Key 
column must be defi ned. Click Next to continue.
 
10. Enter EyeBolt for the family name and set the Standard Organization option to ANSI. 
Only the family name is required; however, designating the Standard Organization 
option allows the part to be listed when fi ltering per standard. You can also type a cus-
tom standard into the fi eld, such as your company name. This allows you to create a fi lter 
for the parts you published.
 
11. Click Next, and notice the preview thumbnail. You can use the Browse icon to select a 
different graphic fi le for use as a thumbnail, if one exists.
 
12. Click Publish to complete the task and add this part to your custom Content Center 
library. Click the OK button in the successful publish confi rmation box.
This creates the part family table in the Content Center library, but at this point there is only 
one row in the table. Typically you will want to add a row for each size or different type of the 
component. You can do this by using the Content Center Editor (on the Manage tab). Figure 7.35 
shows the family key and properties steps of the Publish Guide. You can close this part without 
saving changes.
Figure 7.35
Publishing a part to 
Content Center
You can also convert a part to a table-driven iPart before publishing and include the rows for 
each size and type of the part confi guration in the iPart table. Once you have a workable iPart 
that behaves correctly, you can open the original factory iPart and publish the part. The iPart 
may be a custom iPart or a fully table-driven factory. iParts containing multiple row defi nitions 
in the table will convert to a fully table-driven Content Center part. You can fi nd more informa-
tion on iParts in the section “Working with iParts” at the beginning of this chapter.
Before using a newly published Content Center component in production, test the part in a 
blank assembly for proper function.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 373
Adding a New Category to Content Center
If you need a unique category for your own speciﬁ c parts, you can simply add a new family of parts 
instead of using an existing category. You can do this from the Content Center Editor (accessed from 
the Manage tab). Make sure the library view is set to view only the read/write library in which you 
intend to create the new category and that the tree view is enabled. Th en right-click in the blank 
space in the Category View pane and choose Create Category. You can also create a subcategory by 
right-clicking an existing category and selecting Create Category.
Th e Bottom Line
Create and modify iParts.  iParts are the solution to creating parts that allow for an infi nite 
number of variations without affecting other members of the same part family already used 
within your designs.
Master It  You use a purchased specialty part in your designs and would like to create 
the many size confi gurations that this part comes in ahead of time for use within assem-
bly design. How would this be done?
Create and use iFeatures and punches.  Creating a library of often-used features is essen-
tial to standardization and improved productivity within your design workfl ow.
Master It  You want to be able to place common punches, slots, and milled features 
quickly rather than having to generate the feature every time. What is the best way to 
approach this?
Copy and clone features.  You do not have to create iFeatures to reuse various part features 
in your designs. If a part feature will have limited use in other designs, it is often better to 
simply copy it from part to part or from face to face on the same part.
Master It  You need to reuse features within a part or among parts. You consider 
iFeatures but realize that this feature is not used often enough to justify setting up 
an iFeature. How would you proceed?

374 | CHAPTER 7 REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES
Link parameters between two fi les.  Linking design parameters between two or more fi les 
allows you to control design changes from a single source, making it easy to update an entire 
design from one fi le.
Master It  You want to specify the overall length and width of a layout design in a base 
part and then have other components update as changes are made to this part. What are 
the methods to do this?
Confi gure, create, and access Content Center parts.  Content Center provides a great 
opportunity to reuse database-created geometry within assemblies and within functional-
design modules. The Content Center Editor provides the means to add custom content into 
Content Center. You can create and add custom libraries to your current project fi le.
 Master It  You would like to change the part numbers in some Content Center compo-
nents to match the part numbers your company uses. You would also like to add propri-
etary components to Content Center. How do you customize Conte nt Center?

Chapter 8
Assembly Design Workﬂ ows
A typical assembly fi le is composed of links to the included components and assembly relation-
ships. The components are parts or subassemblies that exist as separate fi les. When components 
are placed into an assembly fi le, links to those individual fi les are created in the assembly fi le. 
Initially a component is free-fl oating and can be moved and rotated in any direction unless it’s 
grounded in place or constrained to other components.
For example, if you were to create an assembly of a simple drilled base plate and a bolt to be 
inserted in the hole, you would have three fi les:
 
◆
The assembly fi le (with a fi lename extension of .iam)
 
◆
The base plate part fi le (with a fi lename extension of .ipt)
 
◆
The bolt part fi le (with a fi lename extension of .ipt)
When the part fi les are placed into the assembly fi le, links are created to the locations of 
those fi les. If the hole in the base plate part is enlarged, the assembly is automatically updated 
to refl ect that change since it is linked to the part fi le. To assemble the plate and bolt, at least 
one assembly relationship would be created by selecting the shaft of the bolt and the hole in 
the plate. Assembly relationships can be created using the Constraint tool or the Joint tool. 
Assembly relationships have two functions:
 
◆
They defi ne how two or more components relate to one another.
 
◆
They limit the degrees of freedom any one component has in the assembly.
Developing a good assembly design workfl ow is paramount to achieving performance, fl ex-
ibility, and stability in your designs. In this chapter, you’ll explore several types of workfl ows 
to achieve that goal. Included in this chapter is a discussion on how to use subassemblies to 
enhance performance. Using subassemblies within your design can substantially improve per-
formance. Component count can be in the hundreds of thousands of parts, as long as you have 
suffi cient memory on your system.

Assembly Relationships
Mastering the use of the Constraint and Joint tools to create functional assembly relationships 
is an important part of learning to create assemblies in the Autodesk® Inventor® program. 
Assembly relationships are the glue and nails of construction when it comes to building 
your assemblies. Properly using assembly relationships will permit the construction of stable 
assemblies, assist in developing stack-up tolerances, and allow parts to be driven to show the 
animation of a process.
If you use assembly relationships improperly, you can create a nightmare of broken and/or 
redundant relationships, preventing assemblies from functioning properly, destroying assembly 
performance, and causing rework. Understanding how assembly relationships function in an 
assembly will help assure success in building and editing your design.
Another important concept for assembly relationships is the idea of removing or defi ning a 
component’s degrees of freedom. When you create relationships between assembly components, 
you are also changing the way those components are allowed to move in the assembly, just as 
you do when you assemble parts in the real world.
Degrees of Freedom
Initially each component within an assembly fi le possesses six degrees of freedom. The degrees 
of freedom (DOF) are bidirectional and consist of three axial degrees of freedom along the ori-
gin x-, y-, and z- axes, as well as full rotational freedom around the same axes. You might think 
of degrees of freedom like the roll, pitch, and yaw of an aircraft. For a pilot to maintain control 
of the aircraft, the side-to-side roll, the up-and-down pitch, and the clockwise or counterclock-
wise yaw of the aircraft must be controlled. Likewise, you will create assembly relationships 
between your components to prevent them from moving freely or at least to control the way in 
which they are allowed to move.
For ease of use when learning to create assembly relationships between components, it might 
help to make the degrees of freedom visible through the View tab by clicking the Degrees Of 
Freedom button. As constraints are applied to your component, the DOF triad will change to 
show only the remaining DOF. When the component is fully constrained, the triad will disap-
pear. Figure 8.1 shows the Degrees Of Freedom button and the resulting triad.
Figure 8.1
Activating the 
Degrees Of 
Freedom view

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 377
You can also analyze the degrees of freedom for the complete assembly. The Degree Of 
Freedom Analysis button is located in the Productivity panel drop-down list on the Assemble tab. 
A dialog box displays each component (part or subassembly) at the active level of the assembly. 
The number of translation and rotation DOF are listed.
If you select Animate Freedom at the bottom of the dialog box and then select a component 
in the list, it will move to show the DOF, assuming it is not already fully constrained. Figure 8.2 
shows the Degree Of Freedom Analysis dialog box.
Figure 8.2
Animating an 
underconstrained 
component from 
the Degree Of

dialog box
Follow these steps to animate the underconstrained component:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_001.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Click the View tab and then click the Degrees Of Freedom button to turn on the degrees-
of-freedom triad for each part.
You’ll notice that each part has an icon denoting the axes it is able to translate along 
or rotate around. There are only three triads shown because the part called 8–001 is 
grounded and cannot move at all. You can see this by looking at the browser and noting 
the push pin icon shown on that part.
Enable the Productivity Panel
If you don’t see the Productivity panel, you might need to enable it. To do so, ﬁ rst make sure the 
Assemble tab is active; then right-click anywhere on the Ribbon menu and choose Show Panels. 
Select Productivity from the list.
 
4. Click the Assemble tab, click the drop-down on the Productivity panel, and select Degree 
Of Freedom Analysis.
 
5. Select Animate Freedom at the bottom of the dialog box.

378 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
6. Click 8_002 in the list. Watch it rotate in the free axis, demonstrating its DOF.
 
7. Click 8_003 in the list. Watch it rotate and move up and down, demonstrating its DOF.
 
8. Click 8_004 in the list. Watch it rotate and slide along the face of the plate in two direc-
tions, demonstrating its DOF.
These tools can be helpful when you are trying to determine the assembly relationships 
applied to components in an existing assembly. In addition to animating DOF, you can also just 
click and drag a part to see how it can move. In either case, you might fi nd that leaving the DOF 
triads turned on will help you as you learn how assembly relationships work and are created. 
You can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue on to the next section.
Grounded Components
A component can be grounded in place so that it cannot move or rotate unintentionally. A 
grounded component is fully constrained and has 0 degrees of freedom. Every assembly should 
have at least one grounded component so that it will be stable. If components are not grounded, 
the assembly can become misaligned from the x-, y-, and z-axes and will cause problems when 
you try to detail the assembly in the drawing environment. You can ground or unground any 
component in an assembly by right-clicking it and selecting Grounded from the context menu.
Placing Components in an Assembly
To place components in an assembly, you can use the Place button on the Assemble tab and then 
browse to locate the component. To ground a component while you place it, you can right-click 
during the placement preview and choose Place Grounded At Origin.
Additionally, you can drag part and assembly ﬁ les from Windows Explorer and drop them into 
the assembly. To place additional instances of components already in the assembly, you can copy 
and paste components from the graphic window or simply click and drag them from the browser.
In certain workfl ows where parts are placed into the assembly in the correct position and 
orientation to begin with, all components can be grounded. This is done automatically when 
an assembly is created from a multi-body part using the Make Components tool. If a particular 
component needs to be adjusted, it can be ungrounded and then constrained using Assembly 
constraints or assembly connections.
The ground-all strategy can also be used to rebuild assemblies that have a great many errant 
Assembly constraints resulting from major uncontrolled changes. For instance, if you opened an 
assembly that has 50 constraints and of those 42 have errors, you might be better off to select all 
the components and ground them in place. Next, you would expand the Relationships folder 
in the browser and then select all of the relationships with errors and delete them. You could 
then leave everything grounded or unground and reconstrain them one at a time in order to fi x 
the assembly.
How the Constrain Tool Works
In Inventor, Assembly constraints are used to attach parts or subassemblies together, creating 
assembly relationships between the components and therefore defi ning the way they fi t together 

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 379
based on the selection of faces, edges, or vertices and user-defi ned parameters. In general practice, 
the function of constraints follows real-world assembly techniques where fasteners, adhesives, 
and welds attach one component to another.
There are seven basic types of constraints in Inventor. Most of the constraint types have mul-
tiple solution types that can be used to achieve the result you are looking for. Here is a list of the 
constraint types and their solutions:
Mate constraints position components face to face or adjacent to one another.
 
◆
The Mate solution positions selected faces normal to one another, with faces coincident; 
imagine two plates butted together.
 
◆
The Flush solution aligns components adjacent to one another with faces fl ush; imagine 
two plates fl ushed along an outside corner.
Angle constraints position two components at a specifi ed angle to defi ne a pivot point.
 
◆
The Directed Angle solution always applies the right-hand rule to selected faces or 
edges.
 
◆
The Undirected Angle solution allows either orientation and is used in situations where 
component orientation fl ips.
 
◆
The Explicit Reference Vector solution defi nes the direction-of-rotation axis.
Tangent constraints position two components to contact at a point of tangency.
 
◆
The Inside solution positions the fi rst selected component inside the second selected 
component at the tangent point.
 
◆
The Outside solution positions the fi rst selected component outside the second selected 
component at the tangent point.
Insert constraints are a combination of a face-to-face Mate constraint between planar faces 
and a Mate constraint between the axes of the two components.
 
◆
The Opposed solution reverses the mate direction of the fi rst selected component.
 
◆
The Aligned solution reverses the mate direction of the second selected component.
Symmetry constraints position two components symmetrically to both sides of a selected 
plane or planar face. The Symmetry constraint is typically used in conjunction with other 
assembly relationships.
Rotation constraints allow one component to rotate based on the selection of a second 
component.
 
◆
The Rotation solution allows the fi rst selected component to rotate in relation to another 
component using a specifi ed ratio; imagine two gears.
 
◆
The Rotation-Translation solution allows the fi rst selected component to rotate as it 
translates the face of another component; imagine a rack and pinion.
Transitional constraints specify the relationship between a cylindrical component and a 
contiguous set of faces on another component, such as a cam in a slot.

380 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
When using constraints, a minimum of two constraints are required to fully constrain two 
components together so that their relationship is fully defi ned. Underconstrained components 
allow motion in the unconstrained axis or plane. Components that are fully contained within a 
subassembly will not fi gure into the constraint analysis when the top-level assembly is opened 
or modifi ed, so it is typically best for the performance of your assembly fi les to fully constrain 
all components that are not meant to be moveable. See “Working with Constraints” later in the 
chapter for more information.
How the Joint Tool Works
The Joint tool allows you to defi ne the working relationship between a pair of components with 
a single joint relationship. With the Constraint tool you might create multiple constraint rela-
tionships to remove degrees of freedom; by contrast, you might achieve the same results with 
just one joint relationship, by defi ning the degrees of freedom you intended to remain. Although 
you can achieve the same result using the Constraint tool that you can with the Joint tool, the 
Joint tool results in fewer assembly relationships, which can be much easier to manage later.
Inventor offers six basic types of joints, as well as an Automatic option that will choose a 
type based on the selected inputs. Here are the joint types and options:
Automatic joints create either a Rigid, Rotational, Cylindrical, or Ball joint, depending on the 
geometry of the selections.
Rigid joints position a component in place and remove all degrees of freedom. This joint 
type is used for glued, welded, or bolted joints that do not move.
Rotational joints position a component in place and create one rotational degree of freedom. 
This joint type is used for hinged joints and levers, and it can be created with a specifi ed 
limit value.
Cylindrical joints position a component in place and create one translational and one rota-
tional degree of freedom. This joint type is used for creating a joint between a shaft and a 
hole, for example, and can be created with a specifi ed limit value.
Ball joints position a component in place and create three rotational degrees of freedom. 
This joint type is used for socket and ball joint type joints and can be created with a specifi ed 
limit value.
Slider joints position a component in place and create one translational degree of freedom. 
This joint type is used for hinged joints, levers, and so on, and it can be created with a speci-
fi ed limit value.
Planar joints position a component in place and create two translational and one rotational 
degree of freedom perpendicular to the planar face. This joint type is used when one object 
will move along a planar surface such as a conveyor, and it can be created with a specifi ed 
limit value.
See “Working with Joint Relationships” later in the chapter for more information.
Working with Constraints
As mentioned, several types of constraints are available for use in an assembly. To know which 
one to use and when, you should be familiar with each. Keep in mind, however, that certain 

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 381
constraint types are used more often than others. In the following pages, you will explore the 
creation of the various constraint types.
The Mate Constraint
The Mate constraint type consists of two solutions: Mate and Flush. Figure 8.3 compares the two 
solutions. On the far left the selections are shown, in the middle the Mate solution is shown, and 
on the right the Flush solution is shown.
Figure 8.3
Mate and Flush 
solutions
To explore the Mate constraint options, you will open a simple fi xture assembly and assemble 
two plates to match the completed assembly next to it:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_002.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select the View tab and click the Degrees Of Freedom button to turn on the DOF triad for 
each underconstrained part.
 
4. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or press C on the keyboard).
 
5. In the Place Constraint dialog box, ensure that the Assembly tab is active and the Mate 
button is selected for the type. Make sure the Preview check box is selected and the 
Predict Offset And Orientation check box is cleared.
Within the Place Constraint dialog box, you have three check boxes:
Pick Part First  This check box, indicated by the small red cube, is useful when parts are 
partially obscured or are positioned in such a way that clicking a face or edge is diffi cult. 
This option requires you to fi rst select the component and then fi lters the selectable ge-
ometry to that single component.
Predict Offset And Orientation  This button measures the distance between the select-
ed faces, allowing you to eyeball a part placement and then retrieve the distance. If the 
check box is not selected, a default of 0 is entered for the offset.
Show Preview  This check box, denoted by the eyeglasses icon, controls whether the 
selected components will adjust position or orientation so you can review the constraint 
before clicking the Apply button or the OK button to actually create it.
 
6. For Selection 1, click the orange face on the part with the triangular feature. Watch the 
on-screen highlights to be sure you select the face and not an edge. It may be helpful to 
zoom in.

382 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
7. For Selection 2, click the circular face on the base part.
You should see the part “snap” into place based on your selection points. This is just a 
preview of the constraint and is controlled by the Preview check box. Notice that the fi rst 
and second geometry-selection buttons are color-coded in the Place Constraint dialog 
box. Also notice that as you select faces, they are shaded to match the fi rst and second 
geometry selections.
 
8. To adjust the constraint selection, click the Selection 2 button in the Place Constraint dia-
log box. This removes the previous selection (the circular face) and allows you to reselect 
the mating face.
 
9. For the reselection, click the orange face on the base plate.
 
10. Click Apply to place the Mate constraint on the two parts.
 
11. Select the yellow face of the base plate and the yellow face of the side plate for Selection 1 
and Selection 2 (again, ensure that you are selecting faces and not edges).
 
12. You should see the two yellow faces mate together in a way that is not what you want. 
Click the Flush button in the Solutions area of the dialog box, and you should see the pre-
view update to give a more desirable result.
 
13. Click the OK button to place the Flush constraint and close the dialog box.
At this point, the DOF triad should have only one remaining arrow, indicating that all of 
the other DOF triads have been removed as the constraints were added.
 
14. Click and drag the part with the triangular feature and note that it will slide in the direc-
tion indicated by the DOF symbol, and only in that direction.
You can click and drag the part and see that it slides back and forth in the unconstrained 
direction indicated by the arrow. Leave this fi le open and continue to the next section, which 
discusses the Free Rotate and Free Move tools.
Using Free Rotate and Free Move
Next, you will place the fi nal constraint required to fully assemble the two parts. But before 
placing the remaining constraint, it may be helpful to rotate the part so that you can eas-
ily select the required faces. To do so, you will use the Free Rotate tool. The Free Rotate tool 
allows you to rotate a selected component and rotate just it in the assembly. The Free Rotate 
tool suspends any assembly relationships currently involving the selected component to allow 
it to be rotated. The assembly relationships are reactivated when the Update button is clicked 
or when some other action, such as placing another constraint, forces an update. The Free 
Move tool works the same as the Free Rotate tool regarding assembly relationships. Continue 
from the previous step to see how this works:
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Free Rotate button.
 
2. Select the part with the triangular feature, and you will see the rotate “globe” appear.
 
◆
For free rotation, click inside the rotate globe and drag in short strokes.
 
◆
To rotate about the horizontal axis, click the top or bottom handle of the rotate globe 
and drag vertically.

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 383
 
◆
To rotate about the vertical axis, click the left or right handle of the 3D rotate symbol 
and drag horizontally.
 
◆
To rotate fl at to the screen, place your cursor over the edge of the globe until the sym-
bol changes to a circle and then click and drag around the globe.
 
3. Spin the part so you can see the purple face.
 
4. Right-click and choose Done to exit the Free Rotate tool.
 
5. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button.
 
6. Select the purple face on each part and then click the OK button.
This will fully constrain the part and remove the fi nal DOF arrow from the display. You can 
continue to experiment with Assembly constraints on your own by copying and pasting multi-
ple instances of the parts and then constraining them together, or you can close this fi le without 
saving changes and continue to the next section to explore more constraint options.
Editing and Deleting Constraints
Each of the constraints you placed in the previous steps was added to the browser under the 
parts involved. You can access these constraints to make changes or delete them by expanding 
the browser node for one of the components. In the following steps, you will edit and delete a 
constraint:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose Open.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_003.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Expand the plus icon next to both of the parts in the browser to reveal the constraints 
listed below them. There are two Mates and one Flush constraining these two parts.
 
4. Right-click the Flush constraint and select Edit.
You’ll notice that the options are much like those used to create the constraint. You can 
reselect selection inputs 1 and 2, modify the solution from Flush to Mate, or even change 
the type. In this case you will add an offset value.
 
5. Enter –10 mm in the Offset input box. If the preview button is selected, you should see 
the part adjust to preview the fl ush offset.
 
6. Click the OK button to accept the edit.
 
7. Click the Flush constraint in the browser again. Notice that it now displays the 
offset value.
 
8. At the bottom of the browser is an input box where you can adjust the offset without 
needing to bring up the edit dialog box. Type 12 mm and press the Enter key on the key-
board. The part will adjust to the new offset.
 
9. Double-click the icon next to the Flush constraint in the browser.
 
10. An Edit Dimension box appears, offering another way to edit the offset parameter for this 
Flush constraint.

The Show and Hide Relationships Tools
In addition to locating constraints in the browser, you can use the Show Relationships tool to 
select a component and locate all of the assembly relationships that involve it. Once the relation-
ship glyphs are shown, you can right-click any of them and choose from a number of options, such 
as Edit, Delete, Suppress, and so on. You can then use the Hide Relationships tool to turn oﬀ  the 
display of the relationship glyphs in the graphics area.
If any assembly relationships contain errors, you can use the Show Sick Relationships tool to ﬁ nd 
them quickly.
 
11. It is often helpful to name constraint offset parameters for use later. Type Block_Offset = 
40 mm into the box and then click the green check mark button (or press the Enter key).
 
12. On the Manage tab, click the Parameters button.
 
13. In the resulting dialog box, you’ll see the Block_Offset parameter in the list. Note that 
the other two parameters are for the Mate constraints. Click the Done button to exit the 
Parameters dialog box.
 
14. Select the View tab and click the Degrees Of Freedom button to turn on the DOF triad for 
each underconstrained part. In this case, no triads appear, because the assembly is cur-
rently fully constrained.
 
15. Right-click the Flush constraint in the browser and choose Delete. You’ll now see a DOF 
arrow showing you that the part is free to slide along one axis.
 
16. Click and drag the part to see it move in its free axis.
 
17. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button.
 
18. In the Place Constraint dialog box, click the Predict Offset And Orientation check box 
(fi nd it next to the Preview check box).
 
19. Set the solution to Flush and then select the yellow faces of the two parts.
 
20. Note the offset value reports the current distance between the two yellow faces. Enter 
Block_Offset = 20 mm and then click the OK button.
Mate and Flush constraints will likely make up a majority of the constraint types you edit 
and create. Take the time to master these constraints, and you will fi nd the other constraint 
types much easier to learn. You can close this fi le without saving changes. If you’d like more 
practice with Mate and Flush constraints, you can open the fi les mi_8a_104.iam, mi_8a_105
.iam, mi_8a_106.iam, and mi_8a_107.iam (located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder) and assemble them using the concepts you just learned. Use 
the assembled parts as an example to put together the unassembled parts in each of these fi les.
Mate to Edges, Centerlines, and Vertices
In addition to selecting faces for creating Mate constraints, you can use edges, centerlines, and 
vertices as selections. When using edges or centerlines, keep in mind that you are defi ning a 

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 385
different number of degrees of freedom than when using faces; therefore, the results can be 
quite different. It is also important to understand that edges and centerlines have no negative 
or positive value, and therefore edge-to-edge type constraints are not a good choice for creating 
mate offsets. Instead, use a face-to-edge mate in those cases.
Depending on the available geometry, you will often need to use the Select Other drop-down 
menu tool to cycle through the available selections to select an edge or vertex. To use the Select 
Other tool, hover over a selection and wait for the Select Other drop-down menu to appear. 
Then select the available geometry from the list. Figure 8.4 shows the Select Other tool being 
used to select a center point on the left, an axis in the center, and a cylindrical face on the right.
Figure 8.4
Using the Select 
Other tool
The Angle Constraint
The Angle constraint permits three solutions within this constraint type. The solutions are 
Directed Angle, Undirected Angle, and Explicit Reference Vector. The Directed Angle solution 
always applies the right-hand rule, meaning the angle rotation will function in a counterclock-
wise direction.
The Undirected Angle allows either counterclockwise or clockwise direction, resolving situa-
tions where a component orientation will fl ip during a constraint drive or drag operation.
The Explicit Reference Vector solution allows for the defi nition of a z-axis vector by adding 
a third click to the selection. This option will reduce the tendency of an Angle constraint to fl ip 
to an alternate solution during a constraint drive or drag. Figure 8.5 illustrates the selections 
required for this solution.

4. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, select the Angle button.
 
5. In the Solution area, click the Directed Angle button.
 
6. For Selection 1, click the large face of the painted board that the hinges are mounted on.
 
7. For Selection 2, click the large face of the unpainted board that the hinges are 
mounted on.
 
8. Enter 90 into the Angle input box, and note that the preview displays as expected.
 
9. Click the Selection 1 and Selection 2 buttons to clear them and then select the unpainted 
board for Selection 1 and the painted board for Selection 2. Pay attention to which selec-
tion button is pushed in as you select to ensure that you get this right.
Place Assembly Constraints Using Alt+Drag
Rather than using the Place Constraint dialog box, you can press and hold the Alt key and then 
drag a component into position. Constraints are inferred based on the type of geometry selected. 
Th e constraint is previewed in the graphics area as you drag over the components involved. To set 
a speciﬁ c constraint, release the Alt key and enter one of the following shortcut keys. You can press 
the spacebar to ﬂ ip the constraint solution, from Mate to Flush, for example.
 
◆
M or 1 changes to a Mate constraint.
 
◆
A or 2 changes to an Angle constraint.
 
◆
T or 3 changes to a Tangent constraint.
 
◆
I or 4 changes to an Insert constraint.
 
◆
R or 5 changes to a Rotation motion constraint.
 
◆
S or 6 changes to a Translation motion (slide) constraint.
 
◆
X or 8 changes to a Transitional constraint.
To see the Alt+drag method in action, select the Get Started tab and click the Show Me Animations 
button. Click the Assemblies – Constraints link in the list and then choose Alt-Drag Shortcut 
Animation from the next list.
You will see from the result that the 90-degree angle is dependent on the selection order. 
In this case, you could enter –90 to fl ip the angles also, but had you selected edges rather 
than faces, entering –90 would not work. Next, you will explore the Undirected Angle 
solution.

10. To clear your selections and input before continuing, click the Cancel button to exit the 
Place Constraint dialog and then click the Constrain button to bring it back up.
 
11. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, click the Angle button; then in the 
Solution area, click the Undirected Angle button.
 
12. Select the two faces and enter 90 (for 90 degrees) again. You’ll note the preview updates 
as expected.
 
13. Click the Selection 1 and Selection 2 buttons to clear them and then select the unpainted 
board for Selection 1 and the painted board for Selection 2. Pay attention to which selec-
tion button is pushed in as you select to ensure that you get this right.
You will notice that the angle is not dependent on the selection order. And if you try 
entering –90 for the angle input, you’ll see that the negative value does not change the 
angle. This option can be more stable for use in setting up angles that will be changed 
in confi gurations, animations, and so on, but it is still largely dependent on the other 
constraints in the assembly. If the constraints holding the hinge to the boards were modi-
fi ed, the Undirected Angle constraint may need to be adjusted. Next, you will explore the 
Explicit Reference Vector solution to see that it allows you to more fully defi ne the angle.
 
14. Click the Cancel button to exit the Place Constraint dialog and then click the Constrain 
button to bring it back up.
 
15. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, click the Angle button; then in the 
Solution area, ensure that the Explicit Reference Vector button is selected.
 
16. For Selection 1, click the large face of the painted board that the hinges are mounted on.
 
17. For Selection 2, click the large face of the unpainted board that the hinges are 
mounted on.
 
18. Run your cursor over the cylindrical faces in the center of either hinge. You should see 
the direction arrow fl ip back and forth depending on which face is highlighted.
 
19. When you fi nd a face that points the arrow out away from the center of the assembly, 
click it. This selects the center axis of the hinge pivot and therefore defi nes the entire 
Angle constraint without relying on other existing constraints to establish the vector 
reference.
 
20. Enter 90 degrees.
You’ll note that the preview updates incorrectly, fl ipping the assembly down and causing 
an interference situation. To correct this, you can enter a negative angle, or you can sim-
ply reselect Selection 3 so that it points the other way.
 
21. Click the Selection 3 button again to clear it and then fi nd a face that makes the arrow 
point in toward the center of the assembly and select it. You’ll notice that the preview 
updates to fl ip the assembly up, as desired.
You may be wondering why there are so many angle options. Originally Inventor did not 
include all three of these angle solutions, and options were added to improve the predictability 

388 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
of Angle constraint updates. At this point, though, if you use the default Explicit Reference 
Vector solution, your Angle constraints will update predictably.
As a fi nal note on Angle constraints, you will probably fi nd that using edges rather than faces 
for Angle constraints will provide more predictable results, particularly when setting up con-
straints to be used in creating positional variations for animation or documentation purposes. 
You can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Using the Right-Hand Rule
A good way to visualize the Explicit Reference Vector command is to use the right-hand rule. 
Take your right hand and make a “gun” shape with your index ﬁ nger pointing out and your thumb 
pointing up. Now point your middle ﬁ nger to the left, 90 degrees to the index ﬁ nger. Your hand 
will then be making the three major axes. You can then use your thumb to determine the positive 
axes of the cross product of the x- and y-axes (the index and middle ﬁ ngers).
The Tangent Constraint
A Tangent constraint results in faces, planes, cylinders, spheres, and cones coming in contact at 
a point of tangency. Tangency can exist inside or outside a curve, depending on the direction of 
the selected surface normal. The number of degrees of freedom a Tangent constraint removes 
depends on the geometry. When a Tangent constraint is applied between a cylinder and a planar 
face, the constraint will remove one degree of linear freedom as well as one degree of rotational 
freedom from the set.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_008.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or type C on the keyboard).
 
4. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, click the Tangent button.
 
5. For Selection 1, click the face of one of the sphere-shaped ball bearings.
 
6. For Selection 2, click the face of one of the half-sphere cutouts in the block.
 
7. Note that the preview sets the bearing to the outside. To fi x this, click the Inside button in 
the Solution area of the Place Constraint dialog box.
 
8. Click the Apply button and then create an identical Tangent constraint for the second ball 
bearing.
 
9. Create another Tangent constraint, but this time use the Outside solution and select the 
cylinder of the shaft and the spherical face of one of the ball bearings. Click the OK but-
ton to create the constraint and exit the Place Constraint dialog box.

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 389
 
10. Before creating the last Tangent constraint, click the shaft and pull it up toward the top of 
the ball bearing it is tangential with. This is just so that the next Tangent constraint will 
not solve to the lower hemisphere and run the shaft into the block.
 
11. Create another Tangent constraint, again using the Outside solution, and select the cylin-
der of the shaft and the spherical face of one of the ball bearings.
Tangent constraints are fairly straightforward, and although they are not the most common 
constraint type to use, they are often the only one that will allow you to get the result you need 
when working with cylinders, spheres, and curved faces. You can test the function of the shaft 
and bearing constraint set by clicking and dragging the shaft to see it rotate, and then you can 
close the fi le without saving changes. Figure 8.6 shows the placement of a Tangent constraint.
Figure 8.6
Tangent constraints
The Insert Constraint
The Insert constraint is probably the best choice for inserting fasteners and other cylindrical 
objects into holes or for constraining any parts where circular or cylindrical geometries are to 
be constrained to one another. A single Insert constraint will replace two Mate constraints (one 
along the edge and one through the centerline), retaining one rotational degree of freedom. 
Options for the Insert constraint are Opposed and Aligned. The Insert constraint also allows 
for specifying offset values between components. Figure 8.7 shows common uses of Insert 
constraints.

down inside the boss feature.
 
11. Use Insert constraints to place the blue cover on the base part by selecting the rounded 
corners.
You can continue to practice with the remaining hardware. Use Copy and Paste to add more 
instances if you’d like. When you’ve fi nished, you can close the fi le without saving changes. For 
further practice with Insert constraints, take a look at mi_8a_109.iam and mi_8a_110.iam. You 
can investigate the constraints used in the assembled versions of these models to help if needed.
Minimum Distance Using the Measure Tool
You can ﬁ nd the minimum distance between two assembly components by using the Measure tool. 
To access the Measure tool, select the Inspect tab and select Measure Distance from the Measure 
panel. Click the Priority drop-down box in the Measure Distance tool and set it to Part Priority. 
Next, select the ﬁ rst part and then select the second part. Th e returned value is the minimum 
distance between the two parts.
The Symmetry Constraint
The Symmetry constraint, shown in Figure 8.8, positions two components symmetrically to 
each side of a plane or planar face. When one of the components is moved or its orientation is 
changed, the other component maintains its symmetrical relationship based on the existing 
degrees of freedom of each component.

2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_130.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
The goal for this assembly is to create a symmetry relationship in order to maintain the 
same distance for the number 1 and number 2 bolts as they are threaded into the yel-
low receiver part. Currently the assembly has a number of constraints in place to help 
defi ne the mechanism; however, there is still something missing. If you click and drag 
on the number 1 screw, you’ll see that the behavior is not quite correct. If you click and 
drag on the yellow receiver part, you’ll see something closer to the correct behavior, but 
the bolts do not maintain a symmetrical distance. You’ll add the missing constraint to 
resolve this.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or type C on the keyboard).
 
4. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, select the Symmetry button.
 
5. Select the blue face of one of the bolt heads for the fi rst selection.
 
6. Select the blue face of the other bolt head for the second selection.
 
7. For the third selection, choose the visible work plane in the center of the yellow 
receiver part.
 
8. Click the OK button to create the constraint.
 
9. Now you can click and drag bolt number one to see that the two bolts maintain a sym-
metrical relationship on each side of the selected work plane.
Symmetry constraints are a quick and easy way to set up your assembly to hold components 
equidistant to a planar face or work plane or maintain a symmetric orientation. In this particu-
lar assembly there are two motion constraints in place that allow the assembly to perform the 
threading action. In the next sections you’ll explore these constraints. You can close this fi le 
without saving changes in order to continue.
Within the Place Constraint dialog box are the Motion tab and the Translational tab. From 
the Motion tab, you can add Rotation constraints and Rotation-Translation constraints. A Rotation 
constraint is typically placed between two components, such as gears, simulating a ratio-based 

392 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
rotation. Rotation-Translation constraints allow a linear distance and revolution ratio to be 
applied for component pairs such as rack and pinion sets. From the Translational tab, you create 
constraints between a rotating and nonlinear translating face, such as cams and followers.
The Rotation Constraint
To create a simple Rotation constraint, fi rst place two components constrained around their 
axes. Neither component should be grounded; instead, they should be constrained to allow rota-
tion around the axes. The Rotation constraint applies a Forward or Reverse solution to the two 
components, along with a ratio that will determine rotation speeds, as shown in Figure 8.9.
Figure 8.9

In the following steps you will create a reverse Rotation constraint on a small cog set:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_010.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.

4. Click the Motion tab in the Place Constraint dialog box.
 
5. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, select the Rotation button.
 
6. For Selection 1 click the yellow face on the large cog, and for Selection 2 click the yellow 
face on the small cog.
 
7. In the Solution area, click the Reverse button.
 
8. Note that the ratio is automatically set to 3 ul (ul means unitless). You could enter any 
value you want, but in this case you’ll leave it at 3 based on the selected geometry. You 
should be aware had you selected the cogs in the opposite order, the ratio would be 0.333, 
the reciprocal of its current value. Click the OK button to create the Rotation constraint.
Currently, the assembly is fully constrained and will not rotate. This is because of the 
Mate constraint named Alignment Mate, which has been placed on the XZ origin planes

of each cog. The purpose of this Mate constraint is simply to line up the cogs in their start 
position. To let the Rotation constraint work, the mate must be suppressed or deleted.
 
9. Locate the Alignment Mate constraint in the browser. You can do so by expanding either 
of the cogs in the browser.
 
10. Right-click the Alignment Mate constraint and choose Suppress. The constraint will now 
be grayed out and will not calculate against the assembly.
 
11. Click and drag either of the cogs to rotate them.
If you start the rotation with both yellow faces showing and count the number of times the 
small cog rotates before the yellow face on the large cog comes back around, you will see it 
make three revolutions for every one of the large cogs, as specifi ed by the ratio in the constraint 
input. You can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to the next set of steps, where 
you will create a Rotation-Translation constraint.
The Rotation-Translation Constraint
In the following steps you will create a Rotation-Translation constraint as would be used to con-
strain a rack and pinion gear set:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_011.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your

4. Click the Motion tab in the Place Constraint dialog box.
 
5. In the Type area of the Place Constraint dialog box, select the Rotation-Translation button.
 
6. Hover over any of the component geometry and notice that the selection glyph displays 
a rotation arrow, indicating it is looking for the rotational selection. Selection order is 
important in this case. For Selection 1, click the yellow face on the cog.
 
7. For Selection 2, in the Solution area click along the bottom edge of the rack. Be certain to 
select the edge, not the face. Although there is nothing preventing you from selecting the 
face or anything indicating that it is not the correct selection, the constraint will simply 
not work if the face is selected.
 
8. Note the value added to the Distance input box. This is the total travel of the rack for one 
revolution of the cog. This value is initially calculated from the selections, but you can 
enter your own value as required. In this case, the number is not a whole number because 
of the mix of Imperial and metric dimensions used in this model. Click the OK button to 
create the constraint.

Currently, the assembly is fully constrained and will not rotate. This is because of the 
Mate constraint named Start Point Mate, which has been placed on the rack and cog. To 
let the Rotation-Translation constraint work, the mate must be suppressed or deleted.
 
9. Locate the Start Point Mate constraint in the browser. You can do so by expanding the 
rack in the browser.
 
10. Right-click the Start Point Mate and choose Suppress. The constraint will now be grayed 
out and will not calculate against the assembly.
 
11. Click and drag the rack to see the rotation and translation take place.
Although motion constraints are easy to place, be aware that often the real work is in the cal-
culations to create components with the correct geometry beforehand. If you have a need to create 
a lot of gears, you’ll want to explore the gear generator found in the design accelerator tools. For 
now, you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Transitional Constraints
Transitional constraints allow the movement of an underconstrained component along a path in 
a separate part. To create a Transitional constraint, you fi rst select a moving face on the under-
constrained component. Then you select a transitional face or edge on a fully constrained or 
grounded part. Figure 8.11 illustrates a cam and follower with a Transitional constraint applied.

translational face.
 
7. Click the OK button to create the constraint.
 
8. Click and drag the cam and rotate it around the axis to see the assembly in action.
Components used in Transitional constraints must always be in contact for them to work; 
therefore, no offsets are permitted. The translational face (in this case the cam) can be any com-
bination of fl at, arced, or spline-defi ned faces, but it is generally best to avoid sharp corners. 
When fi nished examining the Translational constraint functionality, you can close the fi le with-
out saving changes.
Additional Constrain Tools and Options
In addition to the basic constraint types and options, there are a number of other tools and 
options to be aware of. These tools and options are covered in the following pages.
Using the Assemble Tool to Place Constraints
The Assemble tool allows you to move a component into place and place a constraint based on 
the selected geometry. This tool is designed to select a component and then fully constrain it. 
When using the Assemble tool, you select the component you want to move into place fi rst, and 
then you select the component you want to constrain to. Because of this, you can constrain only 
one component at a time with this tool. To constrain a second component, you must click the OK 
button to exit the Assemble tool and then select the Assemble button again, or right-click and 
select Repeat Assemble.
As constraints are placed, the geometry involved is left highlighted on-screen. These new 
constraints are not created until you exit the Assemble tool by clicking the OK button. If any 
confl icts with existing constraints are created, you are presented with the Assemble Constraint 
Management dialog box. You can fi nd options in this dialog box to resolve the confl icts.
You can open the fi le mi_8a_013.iam to explore the Assemble tool, following these general 
steps:
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Assemble button, using the Relationships panel 
drop-down.
 
2. Select some geometry on the component to be moved into place.

396 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
3. Select some geometry on the component that is intended to stay in place.
 
4. Enter values such as offsets or angle values if needed.
 
5. If necessary, change the solution type (from Mate to Flush, for example).
 
6. From this point you can do any of the following:
 
◆
Click the Apply button and continue to defi ne other constraints for the selected 
component.
 
◆
Click the OK button to create the constraints based on the previous selections and exit 
the Assemble tool.
 
◆
Click the Undo button to delete the current selections and then continue defi ning 
constraints.
Relationship Audio Notification
When you place a relationship in an assembly, Inventor makes a sound at the time of the preview 
or at the time of the constraint creation, depending on the preview option at the time. You can 
disable this sound by selecting the Tools tab, clicking Application Options, and then selecting 
the Assembly tab. Uncheck the Relationship Audio Notifi cation check box to disable the sound.
You can change the sound by replacing the default sound fi le with one of your choice. The 
sound fi le is Connect.wav and can be found in the C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 
2015\Bin folder (assuming that is the install path).
Constraint Sets
Constraint sets allow you to constrain two components together using their user coordinate sys-
tems (UCSs). You defi ne the UCS in the part or subassembly fi le fi rst and then place constraints 
on the coordinate system planes and axes rather than the component geometry.
You can open the fi le mi_8a_014.iam to explore constraint sets, following these general steps:
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button.
 
2. In the Place Constraint dialog box, click the Constraint Set tab.
 
3. Expand the browser nodes for both components so you can see the UCS features listed.
 
4. Select UCS1 in each part for Selections 1 and 2.
 
5. Click the OK button to create a set of constraints between the two UCS triads.
Constraint sets can often be helpful when components are modeled referencing a common 
datum set in each component. When fi nished creating the constraints, you can close the fi le 
without saving changes.
Constraint Limits
Constraint limits allow you to defi ne minimum and maximum constraint values so components 
can move freely within the limits but not beyond them. You can imagine a model of a door 
hinge. You might want the hinge to swing from 0 to 270 degrees, but not outside of that range or 
the hinge might interfere with itself.

You can open the fi le mi_8a_015.iam to explore constraint limits. In this assembly there are 
four parts. These would be four subassemblies in reality, but for the sake of simplicity, they 
have been condensed into part fi les. The router base is grounded in place, and the y- and z-axis 
assemblies have been fully constrained with constraint limits, so they are free to slide within the 
bounds of the bearing rods and gantry uprights. You can click and drag the z-axis assembly to 
see how it behaves in a realistic manner thanks to the existing constraint limits. But if you click 
the x-axis assembly, you will see that it does travel along the bearing rods realistically, but it can 
continue sliding through the router base and beyond. To fi x this, you will add a constraint set to 
the x-axis assembly, limiting its travel to a more realistic result:
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Constrain button (or type C on the keyboard).
 
2. Leave the constraint Type set to Mate and set the solution to Flush.
 
3. Select the two yellow faces for Selection 1 and Selection 2, making sure to select the large 
yellow face on the router base for Selection 1 and the smaller yellow face on the x-axis 
assembly for Selection 2.
 
4. Click the >> button to expand the dialog box.
 
5. Click the Maximum and Minimum check boxes.
 
6. Enter -10 mm for the maximum value.
 
7. Enter -395 mm for the minimum value.
 
8. Click the Use Offset As Resting Position check box.
 
9. Enter -150 for the offset value (located back toward the top of the dialog box).
 
10. Enter X Travel in the Name input box and then click the OK button to create the 
constraint.
 
11. Click the x-axis assembly, and you will see that it now stops before running through the 
other components.
Figure 8.12 shows the constraint limit being created.
You can drag the x-axis assembly to its minimum and maximum limits, but when you let go, 
it returns to the resting value you set in the dialog box. Keep in mind you are not required to 
use the resting position option. If no resting value is used, the assembly will stay where it was 
last placed, which is the behavior exhibited by the z-axis assembly.
Constraint limits are a great tool to use in the setup of free-moving components to get them 
to behave predictably. However, you should be aware that there may be a small performance hit 
when using too many of these at once. So, keep that in mind as you use them. You can close the 
assembly without saving changes.
Driving Relationships
It is often desirable to simulate motion by driving a relationship through a beginning position 
and an ending position to confi rm the intent of the design. In general, Offset and Angle con-
straints may be selected to drive components within an assembly. To accomplish this, simply 
right-click the desired constraint and select Drive (as shown in Figure 8.13).

limits
Figure 8.13
Driving a constraint
You can open the fi le mi_8a_016.iam to explore the drive constraint options. If you expand 
the Z-Axis Assembly node, you will fi nd two constraints labeled Drive Me. When you right-
click a constraint and choose Drive, the Drive (Angle Constraint) dialog box appears, allowing 
you to alter the constraint by specifying steps between the start position and the end position. 
When a constraint is driven, any components constrained to the driven component will move in 
accordance to their particular shared constraints. The motion may be set to forward or reverse, 

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 399
stopped at any time, and even recorded (click the Record button prior to activating the move). If 
any of the affected components are constrained to a grounded component or if the movement 
will violate any existing constraint, then the drive constraint will fail.
Expanding the dialog box as shown in Figure 8.14 by clicking the >> button will reveal addi-
tional controls over the drive constraint.
Figure 8.14
Drive constraint 
dialog box options
The increment of movement can be controlled by a value or by a total number of steps from 
beginning to end. The length of a particular driven constraint can be controlled by the num-
ber of allowable repetitions from Start to End or can be reversed by using the Start/End/Start 
option. The constraints in mi_8a_016.iam are set up in this manner.
For a continuous revolution by degrees, you may exceed 360 degrees by specifying the 
total number of degrees of revolution or by including an equation such as 360 deg * 3. Another 
approach is to set the End rotation to 360 degrees and then simply increment the Repetitions 
value for the number of revolutions. You can open the fi le mi_8a_108.iam to further explore 
constraint limits.
Other adaptive parts properly constrained within the driven assembly will adjust to changes 
if the Drive Adaptivity option is selected. This particular option allows determination of a maxi-
mum or minimum condition for the adaptive part.
Checking the Collision Detection option allows for determination of an exact collision dis-
tance or angle between the driven parts. Using the Collision Detection option will help you 
determine interferences between moving parts so that those parts can be modifi ed before 
manufacturing. In mi_8a_108.iam there is a small red link that can be swiveled out of the way 
to avoid a collision of parts. If you leave it sticking out and drive the Drive Me constraint and 
enable the Collision Detection option, you can determine where the parts come into contact with 
one another. Inventor reports the angle of collision in the Drive Constraint dialog box. You can 
change the Increment value to a fraction of a degree to see a more exact value.

400 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Contact Solver
Another method for driving components within an assembly involves the Contact Solver option. 
With this option, only minimal constraints are required to drive a number of components. 
Components are not required to be constrained to one another for the Contact Solver to work.
The Contact Solver works in much the same way as parts interact in the real world. Without 
the Contact Solver applied, moving parts can be run through one another, creating interference. 
With the Contact Solver applied, parts will stop when they contact one another. A simple exam-
ple of this is the slide arm pictured in Figure 8.15. On the left, you can see that the arm segments 
have been extended past the point that they could be in reality, allowing the slide stops to run 
through the slide slot. On the right, the parts have been added to a contact set and the Contact 
Solver has been turned on, preventing the slide stops from running through the slots.
Figure 8.15
With and without 
Contact Solver
To add parts to a contact set, right-click the part and choose Contact Set from the context 
menu. An icon appears before each component showing when it has been added to the con-
tact set. In addition to adding parts to a contact set, you must ensure that the Contact Solver is 
turned on; do this by choosing Activate Contact Solver from the Inspect menu. Once all active 
participants within the contact set are selected and the Contact Solver is activated, then a single 
driven constraint can provide a real-life simulation. Note that it is best practice to turn the 
Contact Solver off when performance is a consideration.
To explore the contact sets, open the fi le mi_8a_017.iam and follow these basic steps:
 
1. Select any components you want to be added to the contact analysis.
 
2. Right-click the selected components and choose Contact Set from the context menu.
 
3. Select the Inspect tab and click the Activate Contact Solver button.
 
4. Drag the part with the black end cap in and out to see the assembly extend and contract 
based on the contact points.
Using the Contact Solver for Collision Detection
If you have parts that interfere (such as a dowel pin in a hole) and have the Collision Detection 
option selected, the Drive Constraint command will stop immediately because it will have detected 
this interference. If you need to test the collision of parts, look into using the Contact Solver.

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 401
Redundant Relationship and Constraint Failures
Excessive relationships are considered redundant when you have overconstrained components. 
Redundant relationships will interfere with the proper operation of your assemblies and can 
cause relationship errors and performance issues.
Two toggles will assist in fl agging bad constraints; you can fi nd them by selecting Tools ➢ 
Application Options and selecting the Assembly tab. Enabling Relationship Redundancy Analysis 
allows Inventor to perform a secondary analysis of Assembly constraints and notifi es you when 
redundant constraints exist.
Enabling Related Relationship Failure Analysis allows Inventor to perform an analysis to 
identify all affected constraints and components if a particular constraint fails. Once analysis 
is performed, you will be able to isolate the components that use the broken constraint (or con-
straints) and select a form of treatment for individual components.
Because analysis requires a separate process, performance can be affected if these two check 
boxes are active. Because of this, it is advisable to activate the analysis only when problems exist.
Working with Joint Relationships
The Joint tool allows you to defi ne the working relationship between a pair of components 
with a single joint relationship. This is done by pairing joint points found on faces and edges 
of components. Several types of joints are available for use in an assembly, so in order to know 
which joint type to use and when, you should be familiar with each. Although you can achieve 
the same result using the Constraint tool that you can with the Joint tool, the Joint tool results 
in fewer assembly relationships, which can make managing them later much easier. You can 
also use the Joint and Constraint tools together to fully defi ne the assembly relationship of your 
design as you see fi t.
Joint Selection Inputs
All of the joint types are created by defi ning two origin selections and two alignment selections. 
Keep in mind that the alignment selections are created automatically based on your origin set 
selections. However, the inferred selections are often not the correct solution for particular joint, 
resulting in a preview that is incorrect. In these cases, you can simply click the Alignment selec-
tion buttons again to reselect edges or faces for alignment.
Constraints or Joints: Which Should You Use?
Because the Constraint and Joint tools provide two methods of doing the same thing, creating 
assembly relationships, you might wonder which you should use. Th e answer will likely depend on 
your experience and familiarity with both tools. If you are comfortable with the Constraint tool, 
you might ﬁ nd that it ﬁ ts your approach to creating assembly relationships best, in which case you 
might ﬁ nd that you seldom end up using the Joint tool. Conversely, if the Constraint tool seems 
less intuitive to you, you might ﬁ nd that you prefer the Joint tool.
Th e preference for one or the other of these tools might depend on the type of designs you create. 
For instance, if you create frame structures or weldments with mostly static components, you 
might ﬁ nd that you lean toward creating Rigid joints, rather than Mate and Flush constraints. 
Of course, you might also use a mix of constraints and joints, choosing the relationship type that 
works best for you.

402 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Rigid Joints
The Rigid joint type creates a joint between points on a pair of faces, a pair of edges, or an edge 
and a face. Rigid joints remove all degrees of freedom creating a “fi xed” joint. You can use the 
Flip Component and Invert Alignment buttons to adjust the orientation of the component if the 
preview shows the component incorrectly. Figure 8.16 shows connection points being selected 
for a Rigid joint.
Figure 8.16
Connection points
To explore the Rigid joint options, you will open a simple fi xture assembly and assemble two 
components using a Rigid joint.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_120.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. Use the Type menu to select Rigid from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, hover over the yellow face of the component named Side_302.
 
6. Move your cursor down to select the center-bottom connection point, as shown in Figure 8.16.
 
7. For the second origin selection, hover over the yellow face of the base component and 
choose the center-top connection point, as shown in Figure 8.16.
 
8. Use the Flip Component and Invert Alignment buttons to correct the alignment of the 
Side_302 component.
 
9. Enter -5 mm in the Gap input box in order to set the far faces fl ush.
 
10. Click the OK button to create the Rigid joint. Figure 8.17 shows the result.
Next, you’ll edit the Rigid joint you just created and adjust the selections. You can continue 
with the fi le you have open or close it and open the fi le mi_8a_121.iam.
 
1. Locate and expand the Relationships folder in the Model browser and then right-click 
the Rigid joint and choose Edit.
 
2. Click the second origin button in the Connect area of the dialog box in order to clear the 
selection.

6. Note that the -5 mm gap distance results in a different offset when the two edges are 
selected compared to when the two faces were selected.

404 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
7. Set the Gap value to 0 mm.
 
8. Enter Yellow Faces in the Name input box; then click the OK button to apply the changes.
You’ll note that the name in the browser is now changed to read Yellow Faces. Naming joints 
in this manner allows you to organize and quickly locate joints for editing. You can close this 
fi le when fi nished and continue to the next section to explore Rotational joints.
Rotational Joints
The Rotational joint type creates a joint between points on a pair of faces, a pair of edges, or an 
edge and a face. Rotational joints specify one degree of freedom, creating a rotating joint based 
on the connection points you select. You can use the Flip Component and Invert Alignment but-
tons to adjust the orientation of the component if the preview shows the component incorrectly. 
Additionally, you can create a rotational limit so that the rotational joint will only rotate through 
a specifi ed set of angles.
To explore the Rotational joint options, you will open a simple assembly and create one 
Rotational and one Rigid joint in order to defi ne the rotation of a handle crank.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_122.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
Take a moment to examine the parts listed in the model tree. If you drag your cursor over 
each part name, you will see that part highlight in the browser. You’ll refer to these part 
names in the following steps.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. Use the Type menu to select Rotational from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, hover over the yellow face of the component named 8_105.
 
6. Move your cursor down to select the connection point at the center of the hole.
 
7. For the second origin selection, choose the connection point at the center of the yellow 
face of the component named 8_104 (the gray base component).
 
8. Click the Limits tab in the Place Joint dialog box.
 
9. Click the check box for the Angular Start option and enter 360 deg in the input box.
 
10. Enter 180 deg in the End input box.
 
11. Click the OK button to create the rotational joint. Figure 8.20 shows the result.
You can click and drag the 8_105 component to see it rotate through the range of motion spec-
ifi ed in the Limits tab. This allows the joint to work realistically so that it stops without running 
through the other component. Next, you’ll add a Rigid joint to complete the assembly. You can 
continue with the fi le you have open or close it and open the fi le mi_8a_123.iam.
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
2. Use the Type menu to select Rigid from the list.

then click to select the center connection point of the hole.
 
4. For the second origin selection, hover over the red face of the component named 8_105 
and then click to select the center connection point.
 
5. Click the fi rst alignment button and choose the blue face on the inside of the keyway; you 
might need to zoom in closely to select it.
 
6. Then click the blue face on the key feature on the 8_105 component and click the Invert 
Alignment button to set the proper alignment.
 
7. Click the OK button to create the rigid joint and then click and drag the components to 
see the behavior you’ve achieved. Figure 8.21 shows the completed assembly.
Figure 8.21
Th e completed 
assembly
Here you’ve used a rigid joint in combination with a rotational joint to defi ne the rotational 
limits and assembly alignment of a simple mechanism. Keep in mind that you could have 
achieved the same results using the Constraint tool instead of the Joint tool, or you could have 
used the two in combination. You can close this fi le and continue to the next section to explore 
the Slider joint type.

406 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Joint Selection Options
You can ﬁ nd three right-click context menu options to help you when creating joints:
 
◆
Infer Origin: Th is is the default option, where the Origin is inferred based on the selections.
 
◆
Oﬀ set Origin: You can drag the manipulator arrows or input an oﬀ set value to change the 
location of the Origin. 
 
◆
Between Faces: You can specify a virtual midpoint between two selected faces by selecting the 
two faces and a point.
To use these options, click the Joint tool and then right-click and choose one of the options from 
the context menu.
Slider Joints
Much like the Rigid and Rotational joints, the Slider joint type creates a joint between points 
on a pair of faces, a pair of edges, or an edge and a face. Slider joints specify one translational 
degree of freedom, defi ning a sliding action. As with other joint types, you can use the Flip 
Component and Invert Alignment buttons to adjust the orientation of the component if the pre-
view shows the component incorrectly. Additionally, you can create a linear travel limit so that 
the joint will only slide through a specifi ed linear distance.
To explore the Slider joint options, you will open a simple assembly and create a couple of 
Slider joints.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_124.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
In this fi le there are three bearing pads. One of the bearing pads has been set up to slide 
in the fi rst rail channel already. This was done using the Constraint tool. If you expand 
the Relationships folder in the browser, you’ll fi nd two Mate constraints and one fl ush 
constraint. The three of these together create the relationship that allows the bearing 
pad to slide through a specifi c linear distance in the fi rst rail channel. You’ll use the Joint 
tool to create the same relationship for the remaining two bearing pads with just a single 
slider joint for each pad.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. Use the Type menu to select Slider from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, hover over the yellow face on either of the unconstrained 
bearing pads.
 
6. Move your cursor to select the connection point at the center of the edge near the red face, 
as shown in Figure 8.22.

10. Click the Limits tab in the Place Joint dialog box.
 
11. Select the Linear Start check box and then enter 0 mm in the input box.
 
12. Select the Linear End check box and then enter -250 mm in the input box. The rail is 
300 mm long and the bearing pad is 50 mm long, so the linear limit is 300 – 50, or 250, 
and you use a negative value to control the direction.
 
13. Click the OK button to create the slider joint.
You can click and drag the bearing pad to see it slide through the range of linear motion 
specifi ed in the Limits tab. This allows the pad to work as if the rail had end stops in place. And 
note that you’ve created this relationship with just a single joint, whereas the existing relation-
ship required three constraints.
Next, you’ll add another slider joint to the remaining bearing pad. You can continue with the 
fi le you have open or close it and open the fi le mi_8a_125.iam.
 
1. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
2. Use the Type menu to select Slider from the list.
 
3. For the fi rst origin selection, hover over the yellow face on the unconstrained bearing pad.
 
4. Move your cursor to select the connection point at the center of the yellow face, as shown 
in Figure 8.25.

6. Click the Align buttons to see which faces are being used as the alignment selections. If 
the red faces on each part are not selected, select them so that both red faces are aligned.
 
7. Click the Limits tab in the Place Joint dialog box.
 
8. Select the Linear Start check box and then enter 125 mm in the input box.
 
9. Select the Linear End check box and then enter -125 mm in the input box. The rail is 
300 mm long, and the bearing pad is 50 mm long. But since the connection points are in the 
center of each, you’ll use half of these values to come up with the offsets: 150 – 25 = 125. You 
use the negative of this number to specify the other direction.
 
10. Click the OK button to create the slider joint.
You can click and drag the bearing pad to see it slide through the range of linear motion 
specifi ed in the Limits tab. If the bearing pad does not stop at the ends of the rail slot, edit the 
Slider joint and check your inputs and alignment selections.
Creating a slider joint is a straightforward process; however, some thought is required to 
select the correct connection points and specify the correct limit values in order to achieve the 
correct relationship for each situation. Once you’re satisfi ed with the slider joints you’ve created, 
you can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Cylindrical Joints
The Cylindrical joint type creates a joint between points on a pair of faces, a pair of edges, or 
an edge and a face. Cylindrical joints specify one rotational degree of freedom and one trans-
lational degree of freedom, defi ning a sliding and rotating action. As with other joint types, 
you can use the Flip Component and Invert Alignment buttons to adjust the orientation of the 
component if the preview shows the component incorrectly. For Cylindrical joints you can create 
both angular and linear limits.
To explore the Cylindrical joint options, you will open a simple slip latch assembly and create 
a Cylindrical joint.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_126.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. In the Type menu select Cylindrical from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, select the circular yellow face of the tan-colored part.
 
6. For the second origin selection, select the yellow face of the small latch catch part.
 
7. Click the Align buttons to see which faces are being used as the alignment selections. 
If the red faces on each part are not selected, then select them so that both red faces are 
aligned.
 
8. Click the Limits tab in the Place Joint dialog box.
 
9. Select the Angular Start check box and then enter -80 deg in the input box.

410 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
10. Select the Angular End check box and then enter -20 deg in the input box.
 
11. Select the Linear Start check box and leave the input box value at 0 mm.
 
12. Select the Linear End check box and then enter 200 mm in the input box.
 
13. Click the OK button to create the cylindrical joint. Figure 8.27 shows the result.
Figure 8.27

drical joint
You can click and drag the slide bolt to see it slip through the range of angular and linear 
motion specifi ed in the Limits tab. You’ll note that the catch on the slide bolt can pass through 
the rise in the latch body that defi nes the slot. To prevent this, you could create a contact set and 
turn on the Contact Solver as mentioned earlier in this chapter. When you’ve fi nished exploring 
the results of the cylindrical joint, you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to 
the next section.
Planar Joints
The Planar joint type is pretty basic and creates a joint between points on a pair of faces, a pair 
of edges, or an edge and a face. Planar joints specify two translational degrees of freedom and 
one rotational. As with other joint types, you can use the Flip Component and Invert Alignment 
buttons to adjust the orientation of the component if the preview shows the component incor-
rectly. However, unlike many other joint types, Planar joints have no Limit options.
To explore the Planar joint options, you will open a simple assembly and create a Planar joint 
between game pieces and a game board.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_127.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. Use the Type menu to select Planar from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, select the circular yellow face on the bottom of either of the 
tipped-over game pieces.
 
6. For the second origin selection, select the center connection point of any of the squares on 
the game board.
 
7. You can click the Align buttons to see which faces are being used as the alignment selec-
tions, although in this case the alignment is not important.
 
8. Click the Limits tab in the Place Joint dialog box.

ASSEMBLY RELATIONSHIPS | 411
 
9. Notice that both the Angular and Linear limits options are grayed out and cannot be 
selected, indicating that they are not available for planar joints.
 
10. Click the OK button to create the planar joint.
 
11. Click and drag on the game piece you placed, and you’ll note that it can slide along in 
any direction but will stay fi xed to the top plane of the game board. Figure 8.28 shows the 
game pieces in place.
Figure 8.28

Although the planar joint might seem too basic to be of much use, it is often used in combina-
tion with one of the other joint or constraint types to further defi ne a mechanism or movement 
that translates in any direction along a planar surface. When fi nished, you can close the fi le 
without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Ball Joints
The Ball joint type is most often used to create a joint between center points of a pair of spherical 
faces; however, it can use a connection point found on any pair of faces, pair of edges, or an edge 
and a face. Ball joints specify three rotational degrees of freedom. As with other joint types, you 
can use the Flip Component and Invert Alignment buttons to adjust the orientation of the com-
ponent if the preview shows the component incorrectly. However, there are no Limit options for 
Ball joints.
To explore the Ball joint options, you will open a simple assembly and create a joint between 
two parts.
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and choose the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_128.iam located in the Chapter 08 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Assemble tab, click the Joint button.
 
4. Use the Type menu to select Ball from the list.
 
5. For the fi rst origin selection, select the center connection point on the spherical yellow 
face on the blue arm part.
 
6. For the second origin selection, select the center connection point of the yellow face on 
the gray socket part.

8. Notice that both the Angular and Linear limits options are grayed out and cannot be 
selected, indicating that they are not available for planar joints.
 
9. Click the OK button to create the planar joint.
 
10. Click and drag the blue arm part to see that it rotates in the socket. You’ll notice that it 
can currently pass though the other part.
 
11. Select both parts and then right-click and choose Contact Set.
 
12. Go to the Inspect tab and click the Activate Contact Solver button to turn the solver on.
 
13. Now you can click and drag the blue arm part and see that it will not pass through the 
socket part. Figure 8.29 shows the resulting assembly.
Figure 8.29
A Ball joint
Although the Ball joint has a fairly specifi c use, it can often be the only choice for creating 
certain types of relationships between parts. When you’ve fi nished exploring the Ball joint tools, 
you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Understanding Subassemblies
You create assemblies by placing assembly relationships between parts to position and hold 
those parts together. When working with small assemblies, you can often assemble all the parts 
together at one level. Working with larger assemblies, however, often requires the use of mul-
tiple levels of assemblies for the sake of organization and performance. Lower-level assemblies 
are referred to as subassemblies.
Imagine a common caster-wheel assembly. Although it may seem like a simple component, it 
is, of course, made up of many small parts. If you needed to use this caster in an assembly mul-
tiple times, you wouldn’t place all the small parts into an assembly individually over and over. 
Instead, you would package them as a subassembly and place multiple instances of the subas-
sembly throughout the top-level assembly. Figure 8.30 shows a caster-wheel assembly ready to 
be placed as a subassembly.
Most things you design and build are typically made from subassemblies of some sort. In 
manufacturing it makes sense to create subassemblies of common parts to make the assembly 
process easier. It makes sense to design in the same fashion. In the caster example, it saves you 

UNDERSTANDING SUBASSEMBLIES | 413
from having to duplicate the work of assembling the caster parts repeatedly for each instance of 
the caster that exists in the top-level assembly.
Figure 8.30
A caster-wheel 
assembly
A second benefi t to using subassemblies is the fl exibility they add to the bill of materials. 
Using the caster as a subassembly rather than as loose parts provides the ability to count the 
caster as a single item, to count the total of all the caster parts, or to do both.
Knowing When to Use Assemblies
Although it is often necessary to create parts as assemblies (to have a correct bill of materials or 
to provide the correct motion), it is not always the best choice. For example, in the caster example, 
unless you need the casters to swivel in your assembly, consider modeling the caster as a single part 
or deriving the assembly into a single part. Th is will lower the overhead of your models as well as 
reduce the number of parts to track throughout your design.
There is a third and important concept to consider when working with subassemblies: model 
performance. Imagine that you decided to place four instances of the caster into an assembly as 
loose parts rather than as a subassembly. For the sake of simplicity, say it takes 28 relationships 
among the caster parts and two relationships between the caster and the top-level assembly, for 
a total of 30 relationships. You do this for all four casters, for a total of 120 relationships in the 
top-level assembly. Had you assembled the caster as a subassembly and then placed that subas-
sembly into the top-level assembly, you would have used just 28 in the caster subassembly and 
two per caster, as shown in Figure 8.31, for a total of only 36 relationships.
If you consider assembly relationships to be nothing more than calculations that Inventor 
must make to hold the assemblies together, then by using subassemblies, you have required 
Inventor to create and maintain 86 fewer calculations overall. This reduction in constraints 
can have a signifi cant impact on the assembly’s performance and make the task of editing the 
assembly much easier.

Top-Down Design
Inventor allows you to approach the creation of parts and assemblies in three basic ways. 
Figure 8.32 shows these three distinctive workfl ows for assembly design.

Least Efficient
The fi rst of these methods is called top-down design. In the purest sense, top-down design is 
performed completely within the top-level assembly of a machine or device. Parts and subas-
semblies are created from within the uppermost assembly, as opposed to creating components 
outside the top-level assembly and then placing these components later. Using this approach, 
you can reference and project geometry from other parts within the assembly into new parts, 
thereby ensuring the fi t of the new parts. Another benefi t to top-down design is that the 
designer can better visualize how each part relates to others within the assembly. When it’s 
properly utilized, you minimize the number of overall Assembly constraints required and allow 
for a stable design.
The second method works by creating parts independently and then placing and constrain-
ing them into the assembly. This method is called bottom-up design. Bottom-up design is com-
mon when creating parts from existing drawings and new pencil sketches. This workfl ow is 
ideal for repairing imported geometry, creating standard parts for your library, and convert-
ing standard parts into iParts and iFeatures. Working in the single-part environment does not 
easily allow you to create or reference other parts that will be utilized within your assembly 
design. As a result, this is probably the least effi cient workfl ow for 3D design but is often the one 
employed by new users.

TOPDOWN DESIGN | 415
The third method is some combination of top-down and bottom-up design and is the most 
common. This approach might be called middle-out. This is top-down design with the ability 
to add existing subassemblies and parts as needed. Utilizing various functions such as parts 
libraries, Frame Generator, Bolted Connections, and Content Center components within an 
assembly fi le is an example of middle-out design.
Developing an Eﬃ  cient Assembly Workﬂ ow
Consider an example of a top-down workfl ow to better understand the benefi ts and effi ciency 
of this type of design. Within this workfl ow, you will fi rst create the top-level assembly fi le and 
then create the part fi les:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the New button and select the Standard.iam template.
 
2. Click Create on the Assemble tab, or right-click in the browser or graphics area and select 
Create Component. The default option in the Create In-Place Component dialog box is to 
create a new component as a standard single-part fi le. Instead, click the drop-down arrow 
in the Template area and select Standard.iam.
Available Templates
Th e choices available in the drop-down are the templates from the default tab. If you want to use 
a template from a diﬀ erent tab, click the Browse Templates button instead. Once you click the 
Browse Templates button, you will be presented with the Open Template dialog box, which gives 
you a choice of standards and templates.
 
3. Name this assembly 2nd Level Assembly and then set New File Location to the 
Chapter 08 folder.
If it is known at the time of creating the subassembly fi le, determine the BOM struc-
ture for this subassembly. Note that you can change this later using the BOM Editor as 
needed. Figure 8.33 illustrates the selection choices for the BOM structure.

416 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
The choices for BOM structure are listed here with a brief description. You’ll take a more 
in-depth look at BOM structure settings later in this chapter in the “BOM Structure 
Designations” section.
Virtual Components  These components require no geometry, such as paint, grease, 
and so on.
Normal  This is the default structure for all parts that are intended to be fabricated.
Purchased  These are parts or assemblies that are not fabricated in-house.
Inseparable  Generally, these are assemblies that cannot be disassembled without dam-
age, such as weldments, riveted assemblies, and so on.
Phantom  Typically, this is a subassembly created to simplify the design process by re-
ducing Assembly constraints and to roll parts up into the next-highest assembly level.
Reference  This is used for construction geometry or to add detail and references to the 
top-level assembly.
 
4. In this top-down design example, you will be using Normal components. Confi rm that 
Default BOM Structure is set to Normal and click the OK button.
 
5. You will then be prompted to select a sketch plane for the base component of this assem-
bly. In the Model browser, expand the assembly origin folder and select the XY Plane 
option.
This will place and anchor the new assembly to the top-level assembly origin. The origin 
planes of the new assembly will be anchored to the selected top-level assembly origin 
plane upon creation and will be grounded to the top-level origin plane. This new, second-
level assembly will be activated within the Model browser, ready for editing, as shown in 
Figure 8.34.

6. With the second-level assembly active, select Create Component once again, and this time 
use the Standard.ipt template to create a new part. Name this component Rotary Hub 
and set it to be saved in a subdirectory called Parts within your workspace, as shown in 
Figure 8.35. If the subdirectory does not exist, you will be prompted to create it. Leave the 
BOM structure setting as Normal and then click the OK button.

7. To place the part, select the XZ plane from the Origin folder in 2nd Level 
Assembly.iam.
 
8. Now you are in the Rotary Hub part fi le. Use the Start 2D Sketch button and select the XZ 
plane. You might need to expand the Origin folder to determine which plane is the XZ 
plane.
 
9. Create and dimension the sketch, as shown in Figure 8.36.

10. Press E to display the Extrude dialog box and extrude the outer ring to a length of 1 inch.

418 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
11. Create a sketch on the top face of the ring. Sketch a concentric circle offset 0.5 inch to the 
inside of the overall diameter. Place a center point on the offset circle.
 
12. Start the Hole tool. The center point will be automatically selected. Set the diameter to 
0.375 inch, and set Termination to Through All.
 
13. Create a circular pattern of the hole feature with six instances, as shown in Figure 8.37.
Figure 8.37

of the hole feature
 
14. Click the Save icon. Since the part is active, it is saved, but the top- and second-level 
assemblies are not. Click the Return button twice to return to the top-level assembly.
 
15. Click Save again, and you will be prompted to name the top-level assembly fi le. Name the 
fi le Top Level Assembly and click the OK button.
 
16. The Save dialog displays the state of all the assembly fi les. Both of the assembly fi les are 
marked Initial Save. This means they exist only in memory and haven’t been saved to 
hard drive (or network drive) yet. If you were to click in the Save column to change it to 
No, the fi les would be closed without saving, and you would just have the part fi le on the 
disc drive. Confi rm that the both fi les are marked Yes, and click the OK button.
These steps illustrate the method of creating a true top-down design, starting with the 
assembly, then defi ning the subassembly, and fi nally creating a part to reside in the assembly 
structure. If this seems like a purely academic exercise because it is not the way you typically 
work, you might fi nd that the concepts can still be useful to you every now and again. Often, 
the top-down, middle-out, or bottom-up approach is dictated by the need to assign part num-
bers and create assembly structure to match. Keep these things in mind as you work with 
Inventor assemblies, and you will more than likely fi nd an opportunity to use them some-
where along the way.
Layout Sketches
Another top-down (and/or middle-out) design workfl ow is the use of layout sketches or sketch 
blocks. Layout sketches are created in a part fi le, using sketch blocks to represent individual 
parts as basic 2D symbols. The 2D blocks are “assembled” in the part sketch and can be 
dimensioned and constrained to simulate simple assembly mechanisms to test function and 
to some extent fi t. The fi rst step in creating a layout sketch is to create a part fi le and a sketch. 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

TOPDOWN DESIGN | 419
Next, 2D sketch geometry is created and turned into sketch blocks, with a single block repre-
senting each component within the mechanism. Nested blocks (blocks made of other blocks) 
can be used to represent subassemblies and can even be set as fl exible to allow them to pivot 
around or translate motion along an axis. Once the basic 2D layout design is complete, you 
can use the Make Part and Make Component tools to write out the blocks as individual part 
models from the sketch blocks. From there, a 3D assembly can be created based on, and linked 
to, the sketch blocks. In this way, if you update the sketch layout, the parts and assemblies will 
automatically update.
The following example will introduce layout and sketch-block functionality:
 
1. Click the Get Started tab and click Open.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_8a_019.ipt located in the Chapter 08 directory of the Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. Locate the sketch called Layout Assembly in the browser and click the plus sign to 
expand it.
 
4. Notice that the sketch contains a block called Base Mount. Right-click the sketch and 
choose Edit Sketch.
 
5. Select the Create Block button from the Create panel (note that you might need to use the 
small black arrow to expose the fl yout menu).
 
6. Select all of the geometry on the left of the sketch with the visible dimensions.
 
7. Click the Insert Point button in the Create Block dialog box and then select the lower-left 
corner of the rectangle as the insert point.
 
8. Enter Base Plate for the block name and then click the OK button to create the block.
 
9. Expand the Blocks folder in the browser and notice that the Base Plate block has been 
added to the block defi nitions. The geometry you selected has been converted to a block 
as well and now behaves as a single entity.
 
10. Place a Concentric constraint on each of the half-circle shapes on the base plate and the 
corresponding half-circle shape on the base mount. Exit the Constraint tool by right-
clicking and clicking the OK or Cancel button.
 
11. Select the Arm Assembly block from the Blocks folder and drag it into the graphics area 
to place an instance of it.
 
12. Place a Concentric constraint on the right circle of the Base Mount block and the large 
dashed circle on the bottom link of the Arm Assembly block. Exit the Constraint tool by 
right-clicking and clicking the OK or Cancel button.
 
13. Select the Cylinder Assembly block from the Blocks folder and drag it into the graphics 
area to place an instance of it.
 
14. Place a Concentric constraint on the left circle of the Base Mount block and the larger cir-
cle on the Cylinder Assembly block. Exit the Constraint tool by right-clicking and click-
ing the OK or Cancel button.

420 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
15. Right-click the Cylinder Assembly block and choose Flexible. This allows the undercon-
strained geometry to solve independently at the top-level block.
 
16. Click and drag the free end of the Cylinder Assembly block to see the plunger slide in the 
cylinder.
 
17. Place a Concentric constraint on the free end of the Arm Assembly block and the free end 
of the Cylinder Assembly block.
 
18. Click Finish Sketch to return to the feature level. Figure 8.38 shows the layout sketch.
Figure 8.38

and blocks in the 
sketch
Notice that you can continue to drag the sketch assembly to see the adjustment of the cylin-
der and the angle for the arm assembly. As you can see, creating layout sketches in this fashion 
allows you to solve linear and pivot motion layouts in 2D. Once the sketch layout has been 
completed, you can use the Make Components tool to write each block out to an individual part 
and/or assembly fi le. You can close the current fi le without saving changes or use it to explore 
the Make Components workfl ow using these general steps:
 
1. Click the Make Components button on the Manage tab and then select the sketch blocks 
you want to create components for.
 
2. Select additional blocks to add to the list, or select from the list and click Remove From 
Selection to exclude any blocks you decide you do not want to create components for.
 
3. Select Insert Components In Target Assembly and then set the assembly name, the tem-
plate from which to create it, and the save path (or clear this option to create the parts 
only). If the assembly already exists, use the target assembly location’s Browse button to 
select it.
 
4. Click Next to accept your selections.

TOPDOWN DESIGN | 421
 
5. The next dialog box allows you to name and set paths for the fi les to be created. Click the 
cells in the table to make changes for the components as required:
 
◆
Click or right-click a cell to choose from the options for that cell type, if any.
 
◆
You can Shift+click multiple components and use the buttons above the Template and 
File Location columns to set those values for multiple components at once.
 
6. Click Include Parameters to choose which layout model parameters to have present in the 
created parts.
 
7. Click the Apply or OK button to make the components. If the component fi les are created 
in an assembly, the assembly fi le is created with the parts (and subassemblies) placed and 
left open in Inventor, but the assembly and parts are not saved until you choose to do so. 
If you choose to create the components without an assembly, you are prompted to save 
the new fi les as they are created.
 
8. You can then open each part fi le and create 3D geometry based on the sketch block. 
Changes to the original layout sketch push through to the 3D part and assembly.
Layout sketches can boost your productivity. During the initial stage of design, there are 
frequent changes as you nail down the details. When you initially create the layout sketch, 
you can easily investigate “what if?” scenarios. You can add as much or as little detail as you 
need to defi ne the function and form. If you do need to make a change in the relationship of 
components, you can do that in the layout sketch, and then the update will get pushed to all 
the components. Once components are generated from the blocks, you can edit them and build 
the model parts based on the basic blocks. You can open the assembly called mi_8a_020.iam to 
examine a simple assembly created from the layout sketch used in the completed version of the 
previous exercise.
Flexibility
When multiple instances of the same subassembly are used within a design, each instance can 
be made fl exible, allowing underconstrained components in the subassembly to be solved at the 
top-level assembly. The caster assemblies in Figure 8.39 have been made fl exible so they can be 
swiveled and positioned independently as they would in the real world.
Figure 8.39
Flexible 
subassemblies

422 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
A subassembly instance is made fl exible by right-clicking the instance within the browser 
and selecting Flexible. Flexible subassemblies are displayed with an icon next to the instance 
name in the browser so that you can easily determine which instances are fl exible.
Flexible assemblies can be nested into fl exible subassemblies and will still update whenever 
the original assembly is changed. One common use of fl exible assemblies would be in the cre-
ation of hydraulic cylinders that require extensions of different lengths when used in multiple 
locations within a top-level assembly. When each instance of the assembly is made fl exible, each 
cylinder can move accordingly within the top-level assembly.
If a subassembly with nested fl exible subassemblies is to be placed into a top-level assembly, 
you simply right-click that subassembly to bring forward the fl exibility of the nested fl exible 
assemblies. Consider the example of the hydraulic cylinder. Multiple instances of the cylinder 
might be placed into an extension arm assembly, and each instance made fl exible so that they 
can be allowed to adjust as they are constrained to the extension-arm parts.
If two instances of the extension arm are then placed into a top-level assembly, those 
instances need to be made fl exible as well in order to allow the cylinders to demonstrate fl exibil-
ity. You can use the fi le mi_08a_030.iam to explore fl exible subassemblies.
Adaptivity
Cross-part adaptivity is a powerful feature of Autodesk Inventor, and it can be turned on or off 
at will. Adaptively is an option that allows a sketch or feature in one part to update based on a 
sketch or feature found in another part. Although adaptivity is a powerful tool when properly 
used, it can also cause performance problems when used indiscriminately in large assemblies 
or when an adaptive part is utilized in another assembly without its related part. But you can fi x 
both situations with simple methods.
Because active adaptive parts can cause performance issues in large assemblies, you should 
turn off adaptivity after use. If a related part is edited, adaptivity on the associated part should 
be turned on, and the assembly should be updated to refl ect the changes on the related part. 
Once this is done, that adaptivity should be turned off once again.
Tracking Adaptivity
It is a good idea to turn oﬀ  adaptivity when it’s not in use; however, Inventor does not have a good 
method to tell you what parts were adaptive. One way is to rename the browser nodes so that you 
can tell what parts were adaptive. A simple way to do this is to append -A on the browser node. Now 
you’ll know which parts were adaptive even where they are not currently adaptive.
If an adaptive part is to be used in other designs, save the part with a different fi lename and 
remove the adaptivity from the new part. Otherwise, the adaptive relationships will carry over 
into the other design, and you won’t be able to edit shared parts.
Creating Adaptivity
This example creates an adaptive relationship between two parts and demonstrates how they 
are linked together:

ADAPTIVITY | 423
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open.
 
2. Browse to Chapter 08 in the Mastering Inventor 2015 directory and open 
mi_08a_021.iam.
 
3. Click the Create button on the Assemble tab, or right-click in the browser or graphics area 
and select Create Component.
 
4. Name the new part fi le Gasket. For New File Location, browse to the Chapter 08 folder, 
confi rm that Constrain Sketch Plane To Selected Face Or Plane is selected, and click the 
OK button.
 
5. Select the top face of the rotary hub part for the new part sketch. Depending on the 
Application Options Sketch settings, Inventor might create Sketch1 for you or you might 
need to do this manually. If no sketch is created, use the Start 2D Sketch button and select 
the top face of the rotary hub part again.
 
6. Click Project Geometry on the Sketch tab and select the top face of the existing part. The 
geometry is projected into the sketch. Note that adaptive glyphs have been added to the 
browser to indicate that the part and sketch are adaptive. Also, there is a Reference1 node 
nested under the sketch. This node contains the information linking the two parts, as 
shown in Figure 8.40.
Figure 8.40
Part marked with 
the adaptive icon 
in the browser
The adaptive glyph is displayed when adaptivity is turned on. You can turn adaptiv-
ity on and off by right-clicking the node in the browser. You can toggle the feature 
or sketch adaptivity while editing the part, but you have to return to the assembly 
level to toggle adaptivity on the part. Additionally, you can disable the creation of 
adaptive loops when projecting geometry altogether; to do so, select the Tools tab, 
click Application Options, select the Assembly tab, and then uncheck the Cross Part 
Geometry Projection option.
 
7. Finish the sketch by right-clicking and selecting Finish 2D Sketch from the context menu, 
as shown in Figure 8.41. Do not click Finish Edit or Inventor will not only fi nish the 
sketch but will also exit the part and return you to the assembly.

424 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Figure 8.41
Selecting Finish 
2D Sketch, not 
Finish Edit
 
8. Extrude the Gasket part to a thickness of 2 mm, click the Return button to return to the 
assembly, and then click Save.
 
9. To see how adaptivity works, double-click the rotary hub component to activate that part 
for editing. You can double-click the part in the graphics area or the icon next to the part 
name in the Model browser to activate any part for editing.
 
10. In the Model browser, right-click Extrusion1 and select Edit Sketch. Change the overall 
diameter from 130 mm to 160 mm and click the OK button.
You will notice that the overall diameter and the diameter of the hole pattern of the 
rotary hub component have changed, but the corresponding gasket part remains 
unchanged.
 
11. Click Return to move up to the second-level assembly design state once again. Both parts 
are active at the subassembly level, so the gasket part updates to match the rotary hub 
component.
As you can see, the ability to adapt one part to another can make updates across parts easy. 
You can close this assembly without saving the changes and continue.
Removing Adaptivity from Parts
Once a design has been approved and released for production, you should completely remove 
adaptivity from all parts within your assembly. Removing the adaptivity ensures that the part 
can be reused within other designs without confl ict and will not be updated accidentally.
If you decide to retain adaptivity within your original assembly but plan on using the adap-
tive part in other assemblies, the adaptive icon will not display on those instances of the part. 
This is because only one occurrence of a part can defi ne its adaptive features. However, all 
occurrences refl ect changes and adaptive updates, including occurrence in other assemblies. It is 
for this reason that you must use adaptivity carefully.
To completely remove adaptivity from a part, either activate or open the adaptive part and 
activate the adaptive sketch. Expand the sketch and right-click Reference to select Break Link, as 
shown in Figure 8.42.
When the adaptive link is broken, the reference geometry is converted to normal sketch 
geometry. This geometry will need to be fully dimensioned and constrained. Once the geome-
try has been converted to normal sketch geometry, the part will no longer be able to be adaptive.

ASSEMBLY FEATURES | 425
Figure 8.42
Breaking the adap-
tive link
Making Temporary Use of Adaptivity
Use adaptivity to ﬁ nd mounting holes for positioning hardware components on a base part. For 
example, consider a mounting clip and a base plate.
Constrain the clip to the base plate; then make the base plate active for editing and create a sketch 
on the plate surface. With the sketch active, project the mounting holes, locating holes, and other 
needed geometry from the mounting clip to the base plate. Th is creates adaptive relationships in 
the base plate to the mounting clip.
Once the design is ﬁ nalized and all the mounting clips are properly located, simply turn adaptivity 
oﬀ  on the base plate. When the design is released for production, or at any other desired time, con-
vert the reference geometry created when you projected the geometry to normal sketch geometry. 
Th en dimension and constrain the mounting holes as you would any other feature.
Assembly Features
An assembly feature is a feature created and utilized purely within the active assembly fi le and 
environment. Because this feature was created within the assembly fi le, it does not exist at the 
single part or subassembly level. A good example of an assembly feature in use is the technique 
of creating drilled holes through a standard tabletop within an assembly. Common practice is 
to place brackets on the tabletop to fi nd the mounting-hole locations. This allows the holes to be 
drilled at the same time, ensuring an exact match and placement. Assembly features in Inventor 
mimic this approach.
Examining the individual tabletop fi le reveals that the part fi le does not contain the drilled 
holes, simply because the drill operation was performed at the assembly level rather than the 
part level. To understand the reasoning behind this, you might consider that the tabletop is a 

426 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
common part stocked in the shop and then machined as required for each assembly in which 
it is used. Although the stock part might exist as a cataloged item with no holes, it may exist in 
many different assemblies with holes of various sizes and locations. Using assembly features 
allows you to work in this manner.
Other examples of assembly features are contained within the weldment environment, 
where preparations used to facilitate welding components together are at the assembly level. 
Preparation features allow trimming of soon-to-be-welded components to eliminate interfer-
ences between welds and other parts of the weldment.
Care must be taken when creating geometry within the context of the assembly because it 
is easy to create an assembly feature when intending to create a part feature. Although this is a 
common mistake that new users will make, it is one that anyone can experience. In a multilevel 
top-down design, always make sure you are working in the proper assembly or component by 
double-clicking the assembly or component in the Model browser for the purpose of opening 
that component for editing.
To explore the creation of assembly features, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open.
 
2. Browse to Chapter 08 in the Mastering Inventor 2015 directory and open 
mi_08a_022.iam.
This assembly consists of three parts, two of which are instances of the same part, 
Part_100_8. The other component, Part_200_8, currently interferes with the other two 
parts. Your goal is to cut a keyhole in both instances of Part_100_8 so that the keyed bar 
will fi t into them. Part_100_8 is a stock bracket used in many assemblies; therefore, you 
must take care not to create a feature in it that will have a negative impact on its use in all 
of the assemblies that consume it. To start, you will explore a keyway created by another 
user at the part level.
 
3. Double-click the front instance of Part_100_8 to set it active for edits.
 
4. Locate the feature called Keyway Cut in the browser, right-click it, and choose 
Unsuppress Features.
 
5. Right-click and choose Finish Edit to return to the assembly level.
Notice how the keyway cuts the part in the same location on each instance of the 
part, missing the location on the second instance because of the orientation of the two 
instances of Part_100_8. Another important aspect of the keyway is that it impacts every 
instance of the part, in every assembly it was used in. To fi x this, continue.

and then click the OK button.
 
15. You should see the keyhole cut through both instances of Part_100_8 and the keyed bar 
(Part_200_8) disappear.
 
16. Expand the Extrusion1 feature in the browser and you will see the listing of all compo-
nents involved in the extrusion cut.
 
17. Right-click Part_200_8 and choose Remove Participant so the keyway cut does not cut the 
keyed bar.
 
18. Finally, right-click either instance of Part_100_8 and choose Open. Notice that the keyhole 
is not present in the part fi le because it exists only as an assembly-level feature.
You can close this fi le without saving changes. You should know that in addition to removing 
participating components from an assembly-level feature, you can add components to an assem-
bly feature by right-clicking the feature, choosing Add Participant from the menu, and then choos-
ing the component from the browser. On the right of Figure 8.43, a component named Top-103:2 is 
being removed from the feature named Extrusion 1 so that the extrusion cut does not go through 
that part. On the left, another component is being added to the extrusion feature.

Assembly features can be made with the Extrude, Revolve, Hole, Sweep, Fillet, Chamfer, 
and Move Face tools. Keep in mind that all assembly features are allowed only to cut or remove 
material and cannot add material to a part. Other commonly used assembly feature commands 
within the Assembly panel environment are the Mirror and Patterns commands.

Isolate Components Before Creating Assembly Features
If you select the components to be involved in an assembly feature ﬁ rst and then create the feature, 
you will not need to remove participants that you didn’t intend to cut in the ﬁ rst place.
Managing the Bill of Materials
In Inventor, the Bill of Materials (BOM) is the internal, real-time database that exists within 
every assembly. Real-time means that as components are added to the assembly, they are auto-
matically added and counted in the BOM. Although you might be accustomed to referring to the 
tabled list of parts on the 2D drawing as a bill of materials, in Inventor such a table is called a 
parts list. Parts lists pull directly from the assembly BOM.
The BOM is controlled at two levels: the part level and the assembly level. Both levels factor 
in certain aspects of how the bill of materials is generated, how components are represented, 
and ultimately how the parts list is generated within the drawing environment.
Parts-Level BOM Control
In the part environment, the designer has the ability to defi ne the BOM structure of just a part. 
At this level, the structure can be defi ned as Normal, Inseparable, Purchased, Phantom, or 
Reference. Determining the default setting at the part level allows control of how the component 
is identifi ed within the overall BOM for any assembly the component is used in. By setting the 
structure at the part level, you can control the assembly BOM display according to the part set-
tings. Any structure settings at the part level can be overridden and changed to Reference at the 
assembly level.
Another important structure setting at the part level is the Base Quantity property. This set-
ting controls how the part is listed in the BOM. If Base Quantity is set to Each, the part is tallied 
by count. This is the default for most standard parts. The Base Quantity can also be set to refl ect 
the value of any given model parameter. This is most often set to a length parameter so that the 
Base Quantity property will tally the total length of a part used in an assembly. Parts pulled 
from Content Center and Frame Generator have their Base Quantity property set to pull a length 
parameter by default. The Base Quantity property is set by choosing Tools ➢ Document Settings 
and selecting the Bill Of Materials tab.
Assembly-Level BOM Control
BOM control accelerates at the assembly level. You can access the Bill Of Materials dialog box 
by clicking the Bill Of Materials icon on the Manage panel of the Assemble tab. In the drawing 
environment, the BOM Editor dialog box is accessible by right-clicking the parts list and select-
ing Bill Of Materials.
The Bill Of Materials dialog box allows you to edit iProperties, BOM properties, and the BOM 
structure; override quantities for components; and sort and create a consistent item order for 
generating parts lists. Figure 8.44 shows the Bill Of Materials dialog box.

Exporting a bill of materials is a straightforward process, with icons across the top of the dia-
log box allowing the export of the BOM data in a structured or parts-only view in formats such 
as MDB, dBase, or various Excel formats. The Engineer’s Notebook icon permits the export of 
database information as a note.
Adding and Removing Columns
You can add columns to the model in any of the three tabs in the Bill Of Materials dialog box by 
clicking the Choose Columns icon, which will display a dialog box list in which you can drag 
a desired column to a specifi ed location, as shown in Figure 8.45. To remove a desired column, 
simply drag the column to be removed back to the dialog box list.

The next icon at the top of the Bill Of Materials dialog box allows you to add custom iProp-
erty columns. The drop-down list shown in Figure 8.46 within the Add Custom iProperty 
Columns dialog box will display a combined list of all the available custom iProperties con-
tained within the assembly.
Figure 8.46
Custom iProp-
erty list
If a desired custom iProperty does not exist within the list of components, you can add it 
manually by selecting the <Click To Add iProperty Column> option displayed in the list box. Be 
sure to set the data type to the correct format when manually adding a custom iProperty to the 
assembly fi le. Manually added iProperties will be stored in the assembly fi le. Figure 8.47 shows 
the addition of a custom iProperty column called Assembly Station.
Figure 8.47
Creating a 
new custom 
iProperty
Once custom iProperty columns have been added to the assembly bill of materials, indi-
vidual parts can be populated with custom iProperties as needed. Individual parts that already 
contain those iProperties will show the values within the respective row and column. iProper-
ties that are edited or added to a respective part row will be pushed down to the part level; 
therefore, fi lling out iProperties at the assembly level is often the most effi cient way to populate 
part iProperties.
The Create Expression icon located at the beginning of the Formula toolbar launches the 
Property Expression dialog box so you can create an iProperty expression. The newly created 
expression can contain a combination of custom text and iProperty names in brackets. The 
iProperty expression will be substituted for the fi eld in which the expression was created once 
the expression is evaluated. In Figure 8.48, the expression is created in the Description fi eld.
Looking across the top of the Bill Of Materials dialog box, the two icons to the far right are 
Part Number Merge Settings and Update Mass Properties Of All Rows. Clicking the Update 
Mass Properties Of All Rows icon recalculates the total mass for all components within the 
assembly.
Clicking the Part Number Merge Settings icon allows different components possessing the 
same part number to be treated as the same component. For instance, say six base plates of the 

MANAGING THE BILL OF MATERIALS | 431
same size are used in an assembly. Four of these plates have holes drilled upon installation, and 
two have holes placed during fabrication. As far as the shop is concerned, all six are the same 
part, but in the design both plate types exist as separate part fi les.
Figure 8.48
Creating 
property 
expressions
To have the BOM count the total number of plates, you set the Part Number property to 
match on both items and then use Part Number Merge Settings to have these fi les counted as a 
single item.
BOM Structure Designations
You can choose from fi ve designations when assigning BOM structure to components: Normal, 
Inseparable, Purchased, Phantom, and Reference. Any part or assembly fi le can be assigned one 
of these designations within the BOM. The designation is then stored in the fi le, meaning that if 
a part is marked as Purchased in one assembly, it will be designated as Purchased in all assem-
blies. The structure designations are as follows:
Normal  This is the default structure for most components. The placement and participa-
tion in the assembly bill of materials are determined by the parent assembly. In the previous 
example, you created an assembly fi le rather than a single part. As a result, you will be deter-
mining the characteristics of how this assembly fi le will behave in the top-level assembly bill 
of materials. With a Normal BOM structure, this assembly will be numbered and included in 
quantity calculations within the top-level assembly.
Inseparable  These are generally assemblies that cannot be disassembled without damage. 
Examples of Inseparable assemblies might include weldments, glued constructions, and riv-
eted assemblies. In a parts-only parts list, these assemblies will be treated as a single part. 
Another example is a Purchased part such as a motor.
Purchased  This designation is typically for parts or assemblies that are not fabricated 
in-house. Examples of Purchased components are motors, brake calipers, programmable 
controllers, hinges, and the like. A Purchased component is considered as a single BOM item 
regardless of whether it is a part or a subassembly. Within a Purchased assembly, all child 
parts are excluded from the BOM and quantity calculations.
Phantom  Use Phantom components to simplify the design process. A Phantom compo-
nent exists within the design but is not shown as a line item in the BOM. A common use for 
a Phantom component would be a subassembly of parts that are grouped for ease of design. 
Setting the subassembly to be a Phantom component allows the parts to be listed in the 
BOM individually. Other examples of Phantom components could include hardware sets, 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

432 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
screws, nuts, bolts, washers, pins, and various fastener-type components. A good example 
of a Phantom assembly would be a collection of parts that are normally assembled onto the 
machine one at a time. However, in the interest of reducing the overall number of Assembly 
constraints within the design, the engineer might choose to preassemble the various compo-
nents within a Phantom assembly. That assembly could then be constrained as one component 
instead of multiple parts.
Reference  Mark components as Reference when they are used for construction geometry or 
to add detail and references to the top-level assembly. A good example of a Reference compo-
nent is a car body and frame that represents the outer shell for placement of a power train. In 
the 2D documentation, the car body and frame would be shown as hidden lines illustrating 
the overall design while highlighting the power train as the principal component within a 
view. Reference geometry is excluded from quantity, mass, or volume calculations regardless 
of their own internal BOM structure. As a result, they are not included within the parts list. 
They are placed only within the overall assembly to show design intent and position.
In addition to using these fi ve BOM structure designations for component fi les, you have the 
ability to create a virtual component, which has no geometry and does not exist as an external 
fi le. A virtual component can have a complete set of properties that are similar to real compo-
nents but are primarily used to represent bulk items such as fasteners, assembly kits, paint, 
grease, adhesive, plating, or other items that do not require creating an actual model. A virtual 
component can be designated as any of the previous BOM structure types and can contain cus-
tom properties, descriptions, and other aspects of the BOM data like any other component.
A virtual component will be shown in the Model browser as if it were a real part. Virtual 
components can be created by selecting the check box next to the Default BOM Structure drop-
down in the Create In-Place Component dialog box, as shown in Figure 8.49.
Figure 8.49
Creating 
a virtual

Virtual Components in Templates
If you use the same virtual components in most of your assemblies, you might want to create them 
in a blank assembly, ﬁ ll out their BOM properties using the BOM Editor, and then save the assembly 
as a template ﬁ le. Th en when you create a new assembly, the virtual components will already be 
present. Any of them not required can simply be deleted.

MANAGING THE BILL OF MATERIALS | 433
BOM View Tabs
Each tab in the Bill Of Materials dialog box represents a different BOM view. All tabs permit 
ascending or descending sorting of the rows in the BOM by clicking the respective column 
header. You can also reorder rows by simply clicking and dragging a component’s icon.
With the Model Data tab active, you see the components listed just as they exist in the Model 
browser. You can add or remove columns to populate the Model Data tab independently of 
the other BOM view tabs. On this tab all components are listed in the BOM regardless of BOM 
structure designation. Item numbers are not assigned on the Model Data tab. The model data 
is not exportable or available for placement as a parts list. Instead, this tab is typically used for 
organizing the BOM and assigning the BOM structure designation.
Figure 8.50 shows a bill of materials on the Model Data tab. Notice that there are no item 
numbers listed and that all component structure types are displayed, including Reference and 
Phantom components. Notice too that the last two parts listed are virtual parts and have been 
given different BOM structure designations.
Figure 8.50
BOM Model 
Data tab
In addition to the Model Data tab are the Structured and Parts Only tabs. These tabs are dis-
abled by default. To enable them, right-click the tab and choose Enable BOM View; alternatively, 
click the View Options button along the top of the Bill Of Materials dialog box.
The Structured tab can display all components of the assembly, including subassemblies and 
the parts of the subassemblies. In Structured view, additional icons will be active on the toolbar, 
allowing you to sort by item and renumber items within the assembly BOM. The order of the 
BOM item numbers is stored in the assembly fi le.
The View Options icon allows you to enable or disable the BOM view and set the view proper-
ties from the drop-down. Choose View Properties to modify the Structured view. The resulting 
Structured Properties dialog box contains two drop-down lists defi ning the level, the minimum 
number of digits, and the assembly part delimiter value. If the level is set to First Level, subas-
semblies are listed without the components contained within. If set to All Levels, each part is 
listed in an indented manner under the subassembly, as shown in Figure 8.51.
The Parts Only tab lists all components in a fl at list. In this BOM view, subassemblies des-
ignated as Normal are not listed as an item, but all their child components are displayed. By 
contrast, Inseparable and Purchased subassemblies are displayed as items, but their child com-
ponents are not displayed.

Bill of materials settings that are modifi ed by the Bill Of Materials dialog box will carry for-
ward into the drawing parts lists contained in the assembly. Note that if both the Structured 
and Parts Only views of the BOM are enabled, the same part may have a different item number 
in each view.
Figure 8.52 shows a bill of materials in the Structured view compared to the same assembly 
in the Model Data view. The fi rst thing to note is that all the components have been assigned 
item numbers in the Structured view. You might also notice that the Reference and Phantom 
components that are listed in the Model Data view are fi ltered out of the Structured view. Closer 
inspection reveals that although the Phantom subassembly named TK-035-001 is not included 
in the Structured view, its child parts are listed, each with an arrow next to the icon to denote 
that they are part of a subassembly. Recall that Phantom subassemblies are used to group parts 
for design organization and to reduce Assembly constraints while allowing the parts to be listed 
individually.
Figure 8.52
BOM struc-
tured view
Figure 8.53 shows a bill of materials in the Parts Only view. This Parts Only view fi lters 
out Reference and Phantom components just like the Structured view does. Notice too that 
although the subassemblies are not listed as items, their child parts are. The exceptions to this 
are Purchased and Inseparable assemblies. In the fi gure, the Purchased subassembly lists as a 
single item, since it is a Purchased component comprising two Purchased parts and is assumed 
to be purchased as one item. Note that if you had the need to list the parts as items rather than 
the subassembly, you would designate the subassembly as Phantom rather than Purchased.

Take a look also at the Inseparable subassembly named TK-035-004. It lists as an item along 
with one of its child parts named K-035-01. This child part lists because it is a Purchased item 
and needs to be ordered. Had both children of the Inseparable subassembly been Normal parts, 
neither would be listed in the Parts Only view.
Adding Two Parts with the Same Part Number
You may occasionally need to add two separate part ﬁ les to an assembly but have them listed as 
the same part number. For instance, when you’re using Frame Generator, each member is created 
as a separate part even though those parts might be identical in proﬁ le and length. Th is is done 
so you can modify each part individually as needed. However, if the parts remain identical once 
the design is complete, you can use the BOM Editor and set each identical part ﬁ le to use the same 
part number even though the part ﬁ les have diﬀ erent names. Th is allows the BOM to count the 
parts as a single item.
Assembly Reuse and Conﬁ gurations
Frequently existing assemblies are used in other designs or are used in multiple locations 
within the top-level assembly. There are three basic workfl ows for reusing and confi guring 
assemblies in a design:
 
◆
Copying designs
 
◆
Using view, positional, and level-of-detail representations
 
◆
Using iAssemblies (table-driven assemblies)
Copying Designs
Often you’ll need to copy a previous design to create a similar design based on the original. 
Part of the challenge of doing this with Inventor is creating copies of only the parts that will be 
modifi ed in the new design while reusing parts that do not incur changes, all while maintaining 
healthy fi le links. To do this effectively, you can employ the Copy Components tool from within 
the assembly to be copied.

436 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
iCopy
Depending on the design, you might be called on to create subassemblies containing similar geom-
etry but having diﬀ erent sizes and/or positions in the top-level assembly. Rather than manually 
creating each of these subassemblies, you can use the iCopy tool. iCopy combines skeletal modeling 
(using a part ﬁ le as the “skeleton” on which to arrange other components) and adaptivity. If you 
design curtain walls, trusses, bridge-type frames, or any design where subassemblies are basically 
the same but vary in size and position, you may want to explore the iCopy tool. Th ere are four 
general steps to using iCopy:
 1. Create a target assembly using the skeletal target layout part.
 2. Create the subassembly to be patterned using the template layout part.
 3. Use the iCopy Author tool in the subassembly to make it usable as an iCopy template.
 4. Use the iCopy tool to copy/pattern the subassembly.
To begin this process, fi rst select the top-level assembly from the browser tree and then click 
the Copy button from the Pattern panel (note that you might need to click the small black arrow 
to fi nd the Copy button). You will be presented with the Copy Components: Status dialog box, 
which lists the top-level assembly and the components within, as shown in Figure 8.54. Use the 
Status buttons next to each component to set the component to be copied, reused, or excluded 
from the copy operation.
Figure 8.54
Copy Components: 
Status dialog box
In the example in Figure 8.54, the component named mi_08_309_PCB is the only part that 
needs to be redesigned for the new assembly; therefore, it is the only part set to be copied. In 
the original design, there are two that have been excluded in this copy operation because they 
will be swapped out for other parts that are already created, after the copy has been made. You 
will notice that the other components except the top-level assembly are set to be reused. Once 
the copy status of each part is set, click the Next button to move to the Copy Components: File 
Names dialog box, shown in Figure 8.55.

ASSEMBLY REUSE AND CONFIGURATIONS | 437
Figure 8.55
Copy Components: 
File Names dialog box
In the Copy Components: File Names dialog box, you want to set the destination button to 
Open In New Window in order to create a new, separate assembly fi le. You can then use the 
Prefi x and/or Suffi x controls to modify the existing fi lenames, or you can type in new names 
as required. By default, File Location is set to Source Path, meaning that the new fi les will land 
right next to the existing ones. If that is not desirable, you can right-click each File Location cell 
and choose User Path or Workspace. Care should be taken to ensure that fi le location paths are 
not set outside the project search path. When the fi lename and paths are set, click the OK button.
Rolling Revisions
A large part of any engineering department’s time and energy is focused on revision control. You 
can think of a revision roll as just a copy of an existing design with improvements. Here is a gen-
eral procedure for rolling the revision of an approved design, where Rev1 is complete and Rev2 is 
being created:
 1. Open the Rev1 assembly and start the Copy Components tool.
 2. Configure the Copy Components list to include, exclude, and reuse components as required 
for Rev2.
 3. Set the destination button to Open In New Window and click the OK button to create the Rev2 
assembly.
 4. Rename and set the ﬁ le location for all copied components as well as for the Rev2 assembly ﬁ le.
 5. Add additional components to the Rev2 assembly as needed and make any other modiﬁ cations 
required.
 6. Open the Rev1 drawing ﬁ le and use Save As to create a Rev2 copy.
 7. In the Rev2 drawing, click the Manage tab and use the Replace Model Reference button to exchange 
all of the Rev1 views, parts lists, and other references with Rev2.
The new assembly fi le will open in a separate window. Interrogation of the Model browser 
should reveal that the components set to be reused are listed just as they were in the original 
assembly, the components set to be copied are listed as specifi ed, and the components set to be 
excluded are not present at all.

438 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Using Representations
Inventor provides the ability to create and store three basic types of representations within 
an assembly fi le. Representations allow you to manage assemblies by setting up varying 
views, positions, and levels of detail for your models. Each of these allows for the creation 
of user-defi ned representations, and each has a master representation. Note that although 
user-defi ned representations can be renamed and deleted as required, master representations 
cannot. Using representations enhances productivity and improves performance in large 
assembly design.
Once representations are created in an assembly, you can open that assembly fi le in any com-
bination of those representation states by clicking the Options button in the Open dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 8.56. Keep in mind that although you can open or place a fi le by typing the fi le-
name rather than scrolling and clicking the icon, you cannot access the Options button without 
explicitly scrolling and selecting the fi le in the dialog box.
Figure 8.56
Opening 
a ﬁ le in a 
representation
View Representations
View representations, also known as design views and ViewReps, are used to confi gure the 
display of an assembly and save that display for later use. View representations control the fol-
lowing settings:
 
◆
The visibility state of components, sketch features, and work features
 
◆
Component color and styles applied at the assembly level
 
◆
The enabled/not enabled status of components
 
◆
The “camera view,” meaning the on-screen zoom magnifi cation and orientation
 
◆
The browser tree state

ASSEMBLY REUSE AND CONFIGURATIONS | 439
In effect, view representations allow “snapshot views” of portions of an assembly fi le. Each 
view representation is saved within the assembly fi le and has no effect on individual parts or 
subassemblies. View representations are relatively simple to create and use. To create a view 
representation, follow these general steps:
 
1. While in the assembly, simply zoom and rotate your model until you have the desired 
view showing in the current graphics window.
 
2. Expand the Representations folder and right-click View to select New, as shown in 
Figure 8.57.
Figure 8.57
Creating a 
new view 
representation
 
3. Turn off the visibility of a few parts; these visibility changes will take place only within 
this view representation.
 
4. After creating the new view representation, click Save to preserve the newly created 
representation.
You can protect the view representation you create from accidental edits by right-clicking it 
and choosing Lock. View representations can be accessed either by double-clicking the desired 
representation or by right-clicking the desired representation and selecting Activate. Private 
view representations are views created in early releases of Inventor and are not associative.
Activating a New View Representation to Prevent Errors
Probably one of the most misunderstood “errors” in Inventor is the “Th e current Design View 
Representation is locked” message. Th is tells you that changes will not be saved, and it alarms a lot 
of new users. What this means is that you have turned oﬀ  the visibility (or enabled status or any 
number of other things) while in the master view representation. Since the master is locked, these 
changes will not be saved, and the next time you open the ﬁ le, the model will be at the previous 
state. To circumvent this issue, be sure to activate a new ViewRep or use the one called Default, 
make your changes, and then save. Th is way, your visibility, color overrides, and other settings will 
be saved in the ViewRep.

440 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Positional Representations
Positional representations, often referred to as PosReps for short, can be employed to set up 
and store components in various arrangements and are used to help test and analyze assembly 
motion. Positional representations work by overriding Assembly constraints, assembly patterns, 
or component properties.
To create a new positional representation, expand the Representations heading in the 
browser, right-click the Positional Representations heading, and then choose New. Continue 
by right-clicking the component, pattern, or constraint in the Model browser that you want to 
change. Choose Override from the context menu. The Object Override dialog box will open 
to the Relationship, Pattern, or Component tab, depending on the entity type that you right-
clicked. You can rename the new representation from the default name to something more 
meaningful; however, you cannot rename the master representation.
In the following exercise, you will create positional representations to control the movement 
for the components of a hobby-type CNC router. Note that there are four components in this 
assembly. In the real world, these four components would be modeled as subassemblies; how-
ever, they have been created as simple part fi les in order to simplify the model. Follow these 
steps to explore the options involved in creating simple positional representations:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open and then select the fi le mi_08a_023.iam from the 
Chapter 08 folder of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Click and drag the component named Z-Axis Assembly_08, and notice how it can be 
dragged to cause interference and into an unrealistic location.
Currently this assembly has two sets of constraints defi ned. One set defi nes the X, Y, 
and Z travel limits, and the other set defi nes the home position for each of the assembly 
components. In the current state, all of these constraints have been suppressed. In the 
next steps you will create a positional representation and unsuppress the home position 
constraints.
 
3. Click the plus sign to expand each component in the browser and notice the suppressed 
constraints.
 
4. Locate the Representations folder in the browser and then click the plus sign next to the 
icon to expand it. 
 
5. Right-click Position and choose New to create a new positional representation, as shown 
in Figure 8.58.
 
6. Expand the Position node, if needed, and notice that a positional representation called 
Position1 has been created and is currently active, as denoted by the check mark.
 
7. Select Position1; then click it and rename it Home Position.
 
8. Right-click the Z Home constraint listed under the Z-Axis Assembly component and 
choose Override, as shown on the left of Figure 8.59.

14. Right-click the X Home constraint listed under the X-Axis Assembly component and 
choose Override.
 
15. In the Override Object dialog box, click the Suppression check box and set the drop-down 
box to Enable.
 
16. Click the Value check box and set the value to 395 mm; then click the OK button. This sets 
the x-axis assembly to a static forward and backward position.
 
17. Right-click the Master positional representation and choose Activate. Click and drag the 
z-axis assembly and notice that it is free to drag again.
 
18. Right-click the Home Position representation and choose Activate to set the assembly 
back to its defi ned home position; notice that it is constrained in place.
In the next set of steps you will create another positional representation and unsuppress 
the set of constraints that will control the X, Y, and Z travel limits.
 
19. Right-click Position at the top level of the Positional representation node and choose New 
to create a new positional representation.
 
20. Expand the Position node, if needed, and notice that a new positional representation has 
been created and is currently active, as denoted by the check mark.
 
21. Rename the new positional representation to Set to Range.
 
22. Right-click the Z Travel constraint and choose Suppress (Override), as shown in 
Figure 8.60.
Figure 8.60
Enabling a 
suppressed 
constraint
This toggles the suppression value of the Z Travel constraint and enables it so the travel 
is limited in the z-axis to hold it to a realistic range of motion. Next, you will do the same 
for the Y and X Travel constraints.
 
23. Right-click the Y Travel constraint and choose Suppress (Override).
 
24. Right-click the X Travel constraint and choose Suppress (Override). Note that you may 
need to expand the x-axis assembly component in the browser to fi nd this constraint.

25. Right-click the Home Position representation and choose Activate. Click and drag the 
z-axis assembly to set the assembly back to its home position.
 
26. Right-click the Set to Range representation and choose Activate to set the assembly so it 
can be dragged within its defi ned range of travel.
As you can see from the previous steps, positional representations are a powerful way to 
show components in multiple positions as required during the operation of a mechanism. You 
can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue to explore the use of positional 
representations in subassemblies. Follow these steps to discover the tools used for handling 
positional representations in subassemblies:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open and then select the fi le mi_08a_024.iam from the 
Chapter 08 folder of the Mastering Inventor 2015 directory.
 
2. Expand the Representations folder for the top-level assembly (located at the top of the 
browser tree).
 
3. Right-click Position and choose New to create a new positional representation.
 
4. Expand the Position node, if needed, and notice that a positional representation called 
Position1 has been created and is currently active, as denoted by the check mark.
 
5. Select Position1; then click it and rename it Range of Travel.
 
6. Expand the component called CNC Hobby Router and then expand the Representations 
folder for this subassembly.
 
7. Expand the Position node to reveal the positional representations already created in this 
subassembly.
 
8. Right-click the Set To Range positional representation and choose Activate.
At this point, you have created a positional representation for the top-level assembly and 
then set that positional representation to use the Set To Range positional representation 
in the subassembly.
 
9. Click and drag the router assembly and notice that the parts will not move. To fi x this, 
you need to set the subassembly to be fl exible within the positional representation.
 
10. Right-click the CNC Hobby Router (either in the browser or in the graphics area) and 
choose Override from the context menu. In the Override Object dialog box, you will 
notice that Set To Range is the active positional representation as defi ned previously.
 
11. Click the Flexible Status check box and set the drop-down box to Flexible; then click the 
OK button.
 
12. Click and drag the router assembly and notice that the parts will now move according to 
the Set To Range positional representation that is defi ned in the subassembly.
Once you’ve explored the nested positional representations, you can close this fi le without 
saving changes. Positional representations also allow the reuse of identical subassemblies 
within a top-level assembly fi le. By using positional representations in conjunction with fl ex-
ible assemblies, you can demonstrate a subassembly in different positions. Figure 8.61 shows an 

444 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
assembly containing multiple instances of a cylinder subassembly, each at a different extension 
length. This model could be created by setting up positional representations in the cylinder 
subassembly defi ning each extension value or by leaving the cylinder subassembly undercon-
strained and then setting each subassembly to be fl exible.
Figure 8.61

instances of 
a cylinder 
subassembly
To help manage positional representations, you can set up the browser to display only the 
overrides present in each positional representation, as shown in Figure 8.62. The buttons along 
the top of the Representations browser allow you to create a new positional representation, vali-
date the overrides to ensure that no errors are created in the representations, and manage the 
overrides via Microsoft Excel.
Figure 8.62
Th e Representations

Because the positional representation properties of an assembly are stored separately, mul-
tiple views can be created in the drawing environment, representing different positions of the 
same assembly. Figure 8.63 shows an example of an overlay view showing both available posi-
tions of a bucket assembly on a front loader.

ASSEMBLY REUSE AND CONFIGURATIONS | 445
Level of Detail Representations
Proper use of level of detail (LOD) improves speed and reduces the memory required to load and 
navigate large assemblies. When working with a large assembly, you suppress components that 
are not required for a certain aspect of working with the design and then save that suppression 
state as a level-of-detail representation. For instance, if you are designing a large material-handling 
unit, you might open the unit in the LOD representation with everything suppressed except the 
frame while you work on the frame skins, thereby signifi cantly reducing the number of parts 
loaded into memory.
Suppression vs. Visibility
It is a common misconception that making components invisible reduces the overhead of your 
assemblies. When a component’s visibility is toggled oﬀ , it is still loaded into memory. To unload 
it from memory, you must utilize LOD reps. If you work with large assemblies, you can set All 
Components Suppressed as the default LOD. Th e assembly will open more quickly, and then you can 
select a previously deﬁ ned LOD or unsuppress just the parts you want to work with. Th is method 
consumes less RAM than opening the complete assembly and then suppressing components.
Another common example of LOD representations might be to suppress external components 
while working on internal components simply for convenience. In addition to this standard 
method of suppressing components to create LOD, you can employ substitute LOD representa-
tions to trade out a large multipart assembly with a single part derived from that assembly.
Just as view and positional representations have master representations, so does the LOD. 
However, there are three additional default LOD representations: All Components Suppressed, 
All Parts Suppressed, and All Content Center Suppressed. These system-defi ned LODs cannot 
be removed or modifi ed.
All Components Suppressed  Suppresses everything within the assembly, allowing you to 
quickly open the assembly and then unsuppress components as required.
All Parts Suppressed  Suppresses all parts at all levels of the assembly; however, subas-
semblies are loaded, allowing you to examine the assembly structure without loading all the 
part fi les.
All Content Center Suppressed  Suppresses any component in the assembly that is stored 
in the Content Center Files directory as designated by the IPJ (project) fi le.
Although Chapter 9, “Large Assembly Strategies,” covers the specifi c steps to create LODs, 
here are the general procedures.
To create a user-defi ned LOD, follow these steps:
 
1. Expand the Representations heading in the browser, right-click the Level Of Detail head-
ing, and then choose New Level Of Detail.
 
2. Continue by right-clicking the component or components you want to suppress and 
choosing Suppress from the menu.
 
3. Once this is done, you must save the assembly while still in the LOD.
 
4. After saving the assembly, you can create more LOD representations or fl ip from one to 
another to compare the results.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

446 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
To create a substitute LOD, you start by expanding the Representations heading in the 
browser, right-click the Level Of Detail heading, and then choose New Substitute. There are two 
methods for creating substitutes. The fi rst method simply prompts you to select any existing 
part fi le to swap out for the assembly fi le in the LOD, and the second creates a derived part from 
the source assembly. When using the Derive Assembly method, you are asked to specify a part 
template to use and then are brought right into the derive assembly process. The derived part is 
automatically marked as a substitute during the derive process and placed into the LOD.
On the left, Figure 8.64 shows an assembly in its master LOD with 302 component occur-
rences in the assembly and 77 unique fi les open in the Inventor session, denoted by the num-
bers at the bottom of the image. On the right, the same assembly is set to a substitute LOD and 
reduced to a single component in the assembly, and only two unique fi les open in the Inventor 
session. As you can imagine, you can achieve a signifi cant savings in memory by placing an 
assembly with a substitute LOD active into a top-level assembly.
Figure 8.64
Substitute LOD 
representation
It is important to understand that substitute LODs are intended to be used either by exclud-
ing components during the derive process or in combination with user-defi ned LODs to exclude 
components. Simply making a substitute LOD of an assembly with all components included 
may not give you the performance gain you anticipated unless you have made the substitute 
from another LOD that has parts suppressed or you have excluded parts while creating the sub-
stitute LOD.
LOD states are created automatically when you suppress components while in the master 
LOD. To save suppressions to a new LOD representation, click Save, and you will be prompted 
to click Yes or No to save the LOD. If you choose Yes, you can specify a name for the LOD. If you 
choose No, the suppression states of the component are discarded, and the assembly is saved in 
the master LOD.

ASSEMBLY REUSE AND CONFIGURATIONS | 447
Temporary LOD representations are created in subassemblies when a subassembly com-
ponent is suppressed from a top-level assembly. A tilde and index number are listed after the 
subassembly name to denote a temporary LOD state. Note that the subassembly is not modifi ed. 
You can open the subassembly on its own and save the suppression states as a named LOD if 
desired.
It is important to understand the difference between LOD representations and iAssembly 
confi gurations with respect to how they affect the bill of materials. Although you can suppress 
features at will and substitute part fi les for assemblies with the use of LOD representations, 
Inventor still understands that all the parts in the master LOD will be included in the bill of 
materials. When you suppress a component in an LOD representation used in a drawing view, 
the view updates and any balloons attached to that component are deleted. However, the parts 
list will still list the component because it always refers to the master bill of materials.
If your intent is to create an assembly confi guration where some parts are to be listed in the 
bill of materials and others excluded, an iAssembly is the correct tool.
LODs and Parts Lists
New Inventor users often attempt to use LODs to create a parts list in the drawing environment 
that shows only the unsuppressed components. However, this is not allowed outright. To use an 
existing LOD for parts-list purposes, you should right-click it in the browser and choose Copy To 
View Rep. Once the View Rep is created, it can be used in the parts list by editing the parts list, 
clicking the Filter Settings button in the Parts List edit dialog box, and then selecting Assembly 
View Representation from the list.
Using iAssemblies
An iAssembly is a table-driven assembly fi le that allows the use of component part confi gura-
tions to build variations of a design. Some of the strengths of assembly confi gurations of this 
type are the abilities to swap out one component for another, to include or exclude components 
altogether, and to adjust assembly constraint offset values to create various confi gurations of the 
original assembly.
It is important to understand that when you create an iAssembly, you create what is called 
an iAssembly factory. The confi gurations that will be output from this factory are called the 
iAssembly members. It may help to think of the factory as the parent fi le and the members as 
children.
To create an iAssembly, most often you start with an assembly composed of iParts. First, 
the iParts are created for all parts that will vary in size or confi guration of features. Next, 
create the assembly using iPart members where required. Once the basic assembly is created, 
you add the confi guration table, turning the assembly into an iAssembly.
The assembly used in the next exercise represents a simplifi ed push-button panel. Your goal 
is to create an assembly confi guration with variations in the number and type of buttons used, 
as shown in Figure 8.65.

Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open.
 
2. Browse to Chapter 08 in the Mastering Inventor 2015 directory and open 
mi_08a_025.iam.
 
3. Switch to the Manage tab and click Create iAssembly on the Author panel. This will open 
the iAssembly Author dialog box, shown in Figure 8.66.
Figure 8.66
Th e iAssembly 
Author dialog box
 
4. The fi rst thing you should do is consider the naming conventions for the iAssembly 
members. Click the Options button at the bottom of the dialog box to bring up the nam-
ing options. Here, you would typically confi gure the name for the member part number 
and the member names so that as you add rows to the iAssembly table, the naming drops 
out automatically. In this case, you will simply click the OK button to choose the defaults.
Either column can be set to be the fi lename column from which member part numbers 
are generated. You can do so by right-clicking the Member or Part Number column head-
ers and choosing File Name Column from the menu. The fi lename column is indicated by 
the save or disk symbol.
 
5. Examine the Components tab and expand the tree next to the part called cover_plate_08:1. 
In the tree of each part are four different nodes that you can use to add a column to the 
table. Select Table Replace from the tree and use the >> button to add it as a column in 
the table.
 
6. Now that you have added a column to the table, you will add a row. Right-click anywhere 
on row 1 in the lower pane of the dialog box and choose Insert Row. Your table should 
now resemble Figure 8.67.

ASSEMBLY REUSE AND CONFIGURATIONS | 449
Figure 8.67
Conﬁ guring an 
iAssembly table
The Table Replace column allows you to replace an iPart member for another iPart mem-
ber within the assembly. In this case, the part named CP_001-03 is the sheet-metal cover 
plate. This plate is an iPart that has four different sizes within the iPart table.
 
7. Click the cell in row 2 in the cover_plate_08:1 Table Replace column to activate a drop-
down menu.
 
8. Click the arrow for the drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 8.67. Then select CP_001-04 
and click the OK button to exit the dialog box.
 
9. Examine the Model browser, and you will notice that a table has been added to the 
browser. Expand the table, and you will fi nd a listing of the iAssembly members, 
mi_08a_025-01 and mi_08a_025-02.
 
10. mi_08a_025-01 will have a check mark next to it, informing you that this is the active 
member of the iAssembly. To set mi_08a_025-02 as active, right-click it and choose 
Activate, or simply double-click it.
Working with iAssemblies
Many iAssemblies require only a few size variables and a few components that can be interchanged. 
Although in the exercise using iAssemblies both the plate and buttons are iParts, often an iAssembly 
requires only a few components to be iParts for conﬁ guration.
It is typically best to tackle iAssemblies in a structured manner, conﬁ guring only one part of the table 
at a time and then returning to the model to test that change. Making many changes in the table at 
once may make it diﬃ  cult to determine how changes aﬀ ect the model.
Once a couple of rows are added using the iAssembly Author interface, you can edit the table with 
Microsoft Excel to add many rows at once and quickly make changes to the column entries. Also 
in Excel, you can create formulas to concatenate column entries, calculate entries, or use if/thens 
to determine entries.

450 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
 
11. Now that you have used a different-sized plate, you will need to add another button to 
the assembly. To do so, select the existing black button and use Copy and Paste to add a 
new instance to the assembly.
 
12. Place an Insert constraint between the new instance of the button and the empty hole on 
the plate, as shown in Figure 8.68.
Figure 8.68
Adding an Insert 
constraint
 
13. Once the new button is constrained, set mi_08a_025-01 to be active again in the table 
tree, and notice that you are presented with an error message warning you that the new 
constraint is looking at geometry that is no longer present. Click Accept in the error dia-
log box.
Notice that the new button remains even though the hole it was constrained to is gone. To 
address this, you need to edit the table further and confi gure the iAssembly to suppress 
the extra button when not needed.
 
14. Right-click the Table icon in the Model browser and choose Edit Table.
 
15. Locate part push_button_08:4 in the tree and use the >> button to place Include/Exclude 
in the table as a column.
 
16. Set the value for this column to be Exclude for row 1, as shown in Figure 8.69. Click the 
OK button to return to the model, and activate both members to see that no constraint 
errors occur.

17. Next, you will change out the black buttons in member mi_08a_025-02 to use a second 
green and a second red button. Edit the table, and choose the last two instances of part 
push_button_08 from the tree in the top-left pane. Locate the Table Replace parameter for 
each and use the >> button to include them in the table.
 
18. Set the Table Replace values in row 2 to Red and Green, as shown in Figure 8.70.
Figure 8.70
Table Replace in 
the iAssembly 
Author dialog box
You do not need to change the values in row 1 because one of the buttons is already set to 
Black as required and the other, as you recall, you excluded so that it does not show in the 
row 1 confi guration.
 
19. Click the OK button to exit the table-authoring dialog box and then activate 
mi_08a_025-02 from the table. Note the changes to the four-button confi guration. You 
should now have two red and two green buttons in an alternating pattern.
 
20. Last, you will set one of the buttons to be in a different position. Edit the table to return to 
the iAssembly Author dialog box again and activate the Parameters tab.
 
21. Expand the Constraints folder, select Insert:1, and use the >> button to add it as a col-
umn in the table.
 
22. Set the value of this column to 7 mm for row 2 of the confi gurations.
 
23. Click the OK button to exit the dialog box, and notice that one of the buttons is now 
pushed in because you have modifi ed the constraint offset value.
You can close this assembly fi le without saving changes. iAssemblies allow you to create con-
fi gurations of your assemblies by including and excluding components, confi guring constraints 
values, setting iProperties, and much more. When creating drawing fi les for iAssemblies, you 
often need a drawing for each member. The members have the same annotations and tables, 
with only some values differing.

452 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Use Assembly Design Accelerators
The functional-design tools enable you to create complex geometry by entering size data. Before 
any geometry is created, you can verify whether the design meets the requirements by perform-
ing calculations. The formulas used for the calculations are based on international standards, 
and they are fully documented in the Engineer’s Handbook. This allows you to override or 
ignore certain calculations when experience dictates.
Functional Design vs. Geometric Modeling
Rather than modeling geometry fi rst and then hoping that the form satisfi es all the design 
criteria, in the functional-design method, you use the tools to make sure the design operates 
correctly given the design criteria prior to fi nalizing the product’s shape. If functional design is 
done well, the geometry will be the result of the design process rather than the input to it.
Functional Design in the Real World
You might already use functional design every day but might not identify it by that name. Consider 
the following scenario: You’re called on to specify a V-belt for a current pulley system design. You 
could space the pulleys and then hope to ﬁ nd a belt that ﬁ ts well, but that wouldn’t be typical. 
Instead, you’d most likely narrow down the general size of the belt needed and determine the load 
and speed required and then use this information to look up a proper belt size from a supplier 
catalog, thereby letting the function drive the design and assist you in specifying the belt. You can 
use design accelerators in Inventor to do the same thing.
Working with Design Accelerators
Design accelerators can be overwhelming at fi rst because of the sheer number of accelerators 
and because the user interface is slightly different from the rest of Inventor. Therefore, you’ll 
look at the dialog boxes, the browser structure, and the user interface for these tools.
Design Accelerators Input
Design accelerators are available only in the assembly environment. Design accelerator dialog 
boxes are tabbed dialog boxes, as shown in Figure 8.71. The Design and Calculation tabs appear 
in most of the dialog boxes. Two particular areas in these dialog boxes are worth pointing out.
The Results pane displays the calculated values for a particular design. The Summary pane 
indicates whether a design is acceptable with the given parameters. These panes are hidden by 
default and can be displayed by double-clicking the double line on the right and bottom edges 
of the dialog box or by clicking the >> button along the borders. The border of the design accel-
erator window turns red to indicate a design failure or to fl ag a more general error.
The calculation is not an automatic operation; for example, if a calculation fails and the values 
turn red, you typically change the parameters to correct the problem. You will not see the result 
of your change unless you click the Calculate button. Many calculators offer different types of 
calculations. Choosing a particular calculation method will disable certain fi elds (driven values) 
and enable some other fi elds (input values).

Summary
Results
Remember to Calculate (or Not to Calculate)
One common mistake is not clicking the Calculate button. Th e design accelerators will not update 
when you simply change values. You must click the Calculate button.
Also keep in mind that you can deselect the Calculate button in order to not calculate the design 
and just place design accelerator components that might not comply with design inputs. Th is can 
often be helpful in the early stages of a design when you just need a form to start with.
Design Accelerators Output
There are two sorts of functional design tools: generators and calculators. It is important to 
understand the difference between these two categories. The output generated by design genera-
tors consists of subassemblies with actual geometry in them. For example, the V-belt generator 
will generate a belt part. But it can create pulleys as well.

454 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Design calculators don’t generate any geometry, but the result of the calculation places a sub-
assembly node in the browser and can be edited and repeated with different values. The dialog 
box for calculators is also restricted to one tab: the Calculation tab.
Most (but not all) design generators use parts generated from Content Center. Table 8.1 lists 
the various design accelerators and their dependency on the Content Center library databases.

Design Accelerator Solve States
Many design accelerators use solve states to control when and how they solve for and update 
the geometry contained within them. The solve state of the generator subassemblies is indicated 
by an icon in the browser. Manual Solve is the default mode, but you can change it to Automatic 
Solve by right-clicking the design accelerator component, selecting Component, and then selecting 
the solve mode you want to use. Figure 8.72 shows the Automatic Solve icon next to the synchro-
nous belt component.
Figure 8.72
Synchronous 
belt in 
Automatic 
Solve mode
There are three solve states that can be changed in the Component context menu, as 
described in Table 8.2.
Table 8.2: 
Solve states of design accelerator components
State
Explanation
Solve Oﬀ 
Changes to design accelerator input conditions have no eﬀ ect on the design 
accelerator component.
Manual Solve
Changes to design accelerator input conditions have an eﬀ ect only after editing 
the design accelerator component.
Automatic Solve
Changes to design accelerator input conditions immediately aﬀ ect the design 
accelerator component.
The Solve Off, Manual Solve, and Automatic Solve options are mutually exclusive, meaning 
that when you select one option, it turns the current one off. The Solve Off menu does exactly 
what its name suggests: It turns off the solver completely so that the design accelerator compo-
nent is frozen until the next edit.
The difference between Manual Solve and Automatic Solve is simple. Using the example of 
a V-belt, when the distance between the axes changes, a V-belt will automatically readjust the 
pulley positions if Automatic Solve is on. If Manual Solve is on, the user will have to update 

456 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
the pulley positions by clicking the Manual Solve menu. A red lightning bolt will appear in the 
browser. Manual Solve is used as the default for performance reasons and to prevent interac-
tions with the assembly solver.
The Calculate option on the context menu is a toggle between two states; clicking it once 
turns it on, and clicking it again turns it off. You can toggle this option by using the Calculate 
button at the top right of each design accelerator dialog box as well. When calculation is turned 
off, the performance of the generator is faster.
Because design accelerator assemblies typically consist of multiple parts that are constrained 
together, Inventor offers specifi c edit, delete, promote, and demote tools for design accelerator 
entities.
Using Default Values
Th e values used in the last calculation of a design accelerator component will be reused when you 
create a new design accelerator component with the same generator. If you want to use the default 
values of a design accelerator, hold down the Ctrl key when starting the design accelerator tool.
Bolted Connection Generator
This generator is the most popular design accelerator tool because it is able to make an entire 
set of bolts, washers, nuts, and the necessary holes in the supporting geometry as an all-in-one 
operation. Figure 8.73 shows placement options for the Bolted Connections tool; you might 
notice the similarity between these options and the Hole tool placement options.
Figure 8.73
Placement 
options in 
a bolted 
connection
There are four placement options:
Linear  Allows the creation of a bolted connection without any preexisting sketch by select-
ing a distance to two different linear edges
Concentric  Uses any circular edge (the edge does not have to be part of a hole feature; the 
edge can be part of a cylindrical extrusion) to make a bolted connection with a larger or 
smaller hole size
On Point  Requires an existing work point or vertex as input
By Hole  Requires an existing hole, and the bolted connection will incorporate the existing 
hole
Although the Bolted Connections tool will create holes for you, it is often best to create 
the holes fi rst with the regular Hole tool and then use the By Hole option rather than using the 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

USE ASSEMBLY DESIGN ACCELERATORS | 457
Linear or Concentric option. The disadvantage of the latter two options is that they create only 
a point in a sketch, but the point is not dimensioned and could easily move. When the sketch 
point moves, the bolted connection will not follow the new position of the hole.
When you use By Hole, the bolted connection will automatically follow any positional change 
of the preexisting holes but will not follow diameter changes automatically. Keeping the diam-
eter of the holes generated by the bolted connection in sync with the diameter changes in the 
preexisting hole requires manually selecting a different diameter in the Diameter fi eld of the 
bolted connection. The reason this was done is to give you a choice because you don’t necessar-
ily want all your bolts to increase in diameter when the underlying hole diameter increases.
Placing a Bolted Connection Pattern
In the following example, you will connect the cap with the plate using bolted connections. The 
cap has three holes drilled in it, and they form a circular pattern.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open and browse to mi_08a_027.iam in the Chapter 08 
folder of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Select the Design tab and then click the Bolted Connection button.
 
3. In the Placement area, confi rm that By Hole is selected in the drop-down list.
 
4. Select the top face of the cap as the start plane.
 
5. Select one of the holes. Since there is a hole pattern, the preview will display at the origi-
nal instance of the hole no matter which hole you select. Note too that the Follow Pattern 
option is displayed in the Bolted Connection dialog box. Check the box so that all the 
holes will get fasteners.
 
6. Click the Termination button and select the back side of the plate. The Bolted Connections 
generator is smart enough to know which side of the plate is valid for termination. When 
you hover over the plate, the back side highlights and you can click to accept.
 
7. In the Thread area, set the diameter to 8 mm to match the holes in the cap. In Figure 8.74, 
you can see that holes have been added to the dialog browser pane.

existing pattern

458 | CHAPTER 8 ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS
Note that there are three drilled holes automatically added to the plate. You could click 
the Drilled Hole bar in the right pane and then click the down arrow to select a different 
hole type (for example, counterbore). The Bolted Connections generator is clever enough 
to fi lter out countersink hole types for holes on faces that are not exposed.
At this point, you can add all necessary hardware to fi nish the connection. It is important 
to note that the order of the icons in the pane on the right represents the stacking order 
of the bolted connection beginning from the start plane and moving down. If you want 
to place a bolt on the start plane, you just click the area marked with Click To Add A 
Fastener.
 
8. Click the area marked Click To Add A Fastener above the holes.
 
9. In the resulting selection window, set Standard to DIN and Category to Socket Head 
Bolts.
 
10. Select DIN 404 (or something comparable).
The bolt is automatically sized to be long enough to go through the selected components, 
if the bolt type library selected has a length that is long enough. If you want to change the 
bolt length, you can drag the preview arrow at the end. Only valid lengths from Content 
Center can be selected.
 
11. To fi nish the bolted connection by adding a nut and washer, click the area marked Click 
To Add A Fastener below the holes and select a washer.
 
12. Click the lower Click To Add A Fastener bar again and select a nut.
At this point, you might realize that you want to add a washer between the bolt head and 
the top face of the cap part.
 
13. Click the Click To Add A Fastener bar below the bolt and choose a washer.
 
14. Click Apply to create the patterned bolted connection.
You can continue experimenting with the bolted connection tool or close the fi le and con-
tinue to the next section.
Creating a Threaded Hole in the Plate
If you wanted to thread the plate to avoid adding a nut and washer, you could do so by clicking ISO 
Drilled Hole section of the pane and then clicking the button with the three small dots. Doing so 
would bring up the Hole options, allowing you to change the hole type to threaded.
Calculating the Bolt Strength
Next, you’ll edit a bolted connection and calculate its strength. The design problem you are try-
ing to solve is as follows: Considering an axial force of 750 N and a tangential force of 300 N, 
will three bolts be suffi cient to hold the cap on the plate?

USE ASSEMBLY DESIGN ACCELERATORS | 459
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click Open and browse to mi_08a_028.iam in the Chapter 08 
folder of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Locate the existing Bolted Connection in the Model browser and then right-click it and 
choose Edit Using Design Accelerator. Note you may need to expand Component 
Pattern 2 and then expand Element:1 to fi nd the Bolted Connection node.
 
3. In the Bolted Connection Component Generator dialog box, click the Calculation tab.
The Calculation tab provides four strength calculation options:
 
◆
Bolt Diameter Design
 
◆
Number Of Bolts Design
 
◆
Bolt Material Design
 
◆
Check Calculation
Do you meet the design criteria with just three bolts? It all depends on the material you 
choose for the bolts.
 
4. Set the Type Of Strength Calculation drop-down to Number Of Bolts Design.
 
5. In the Loads area, enter 750 N for Maximal Axial Force and 300 N for Maximal 
Tangent Force.
 
6. Assume that this application requires fasteners with high thermal conductivity. In the 
Bolt Material area, check the box next to the material fi eld and select Copper-Nickel 
C96200. To narrow down the material choices, type Copper in the text fi eld below the 
Material column header. Note that the text fi lter name is case-sensitive.
 
7. Click Calculate to analyze the fasteners.
In the Bolts section, you will see that the Number Of Bolts (z) is now calculated at 4 (recall 
that ul means unitless in Inventor).
 
8. Click the OK button to close the Bolted Connection Component Generator dialog box.
To comply with the calculation, you need to edit the cap and update the hole pattern from 
three to four. Once you’ve done so, the bolted connection pattern will follow accordingly 
if the Automatic Solve option is enabled.
 
9. Right-click the existing Bolted Connection in the Model browser and then select 
Automatic Solve from the list.
 
10. Right-click the component named mi_08a_028_Cap in the browser and choose Edit. This 
will set the cap active for edits.
 
11. Locate the feature called Circular Pattern 1 in the browser; right-click it and choose Edit 
Feature. This pattern controls the number of holes.
 
12. Change the Placement value from 3 to 4; then click the OK button.
 
13. To return to the assembly, click the Return button on the Ribbon menu or right-click and 
choose Finish Edit.

As a result of the changes you’ve made to the number of bolt holes, the bolted connection pat-
tern has updated as well. Although all of the design accelerators are slightly different, they all 
share a common way of solving problems and creating components. Autodesk provides tutorials 
covering each of the design accelerators on the Autodesk Inventor wiki:

Th e Bottom Line
Create assembly relationships using the Constraint and Joint tools.  Assembly relation-
ships are an important part of working with Inventor assembly fi les. Assembly constraints 
determine how assembly components fi t together. As relationships are applied between com-
ponents, degrees of freedom are removed.
Master It  You are new to 3D and fi nd the concept of assembly relationships a bit chal-
lenging. Where can you fi nd a simple overview of constraints?
Organize designs using structured subassemblies.  Subassemblies add organization, 
facilitate the bill of materials, and reduce assembly relationships; all this results in better per-
formance and easier edits. One of the habits of all Inventor experts is their effective use and 
understanding of subassemblies.
Master It  You need to hand off an accurate BOM for fi nished designs to the purchas-
ing department at the end of each design project. How can the BOM be extracted from 
Inventor?
Work with adaptive components.  Geometry can be set to be adaptive so that it can be 
sized and positioned in the context of where it is used in the assembly. You can set undercon-
strained geometry to be adaptive by specifying the elements allowed to adapt.
Master It  You want to set a feature of a part to be adaptive so that it can adapt to anoth-
er part in an assembly. However, the feature is based on a fully constrained sketch. How 
would this be done?
Create assembly-level features.  An assembly feature is a feature created and utilized 
within the active assembly fi le. Because the feature is created within the assembly fi le, it does 
not exist at the single-part or subassembly level.
Master It  You want to make a notch in a standard part that will not affect its use in ev-
ery other assembly it is used in. Can this be done?
Manage bills of materials.  Managing a bill of materials can be a large part of any assembly 
design task. Understanding the BOM structure goes a long way toward successfully confi g-
uring your bill of materials.
Master It  You need to mark a component as a reference component in just one assembly 
fi le. However, when you attempt to do so using the BOM Editor, it is designated as a ref-
erence in every assembly. How can you set just a single instance of a component to be a 
reference component?
Use positional reps and fl exible assemblies together.  Often, you may need to show a 
design in various stages of motion to test interference and/or proof of concept. Copying 

THE BOTTOM LINE | 461
assemblies so that you can change the assembly relationships to show different assembly 
positions can become a fi le management nightmare. Instead, use fl exible subassemblies and 
positional representations.
Master It  You need to show your assembly in variations dependent on the position of 
the moving parts and the task the machine is accomplishing at given stages of its opera-
tion. How do you do this?
Copy assembly designs for reuse and confi guration.  Because of the live linked data that 
exists in Inventor assemblies, using Windows Explorer to copy designs and rename parts is 
diffi cult and often delivers poor results. Using the tool provided in Inventor will allow you to 
copy designs and maintain the links between fi les.
Master It  How do you duplicate an existing design to create a similar design?
Substitute a single part for entire subassemblies.  Working with large assemblies, par-
ticularly where large, complex assemblies are used over and over as subassemblies within a 
top-level design, can tax almost any workstation if not approached in the correct manner.
Master It  You would like to swap out a complex assembly for a simplifi ed version for 
use in layout designs or to use in large assemblies in an attempt to improve performance. 
What is the best way to do that?
Work with assembly design accelerators and generators.  Design accelerators and genera-
tors allow you to rapidly create complex geometry and the associated calculations that verify 
the viability of your design.
Master It  Your design needs a bolted connection, but you are not certain about the 
number of bolts to use to ensure a proper connection. How do you determine this?
Use design calculators.  Design calculators do not create any geometry, but they permit you 
to store the calculations in the assembly and repeat the calculation with different input val-
ues at a later time.
Master It  You need to calculate the size of a weld between two plates to withstand a 
certain lateral force. What tool do you use?


Chapter 9
Large Assembly Strategies
Working with large assemblies is more manageable than ever before with the Autodesk® 
Inventor® software’s Express mode tools. Using Express mode allows you to open a large assem-
bly four to six times more quickly than opening the same fi le using Full mode. Combining 
Express mode with the use of tools such as shrinkwrap and substitute level of detail (LOD) 
representations improves performance and minimizes the time spent waiting. Substitute LODs 
allow you to swap out complex subassemblies with single substitute parts of less detail, all the 
while maintaining model properties and an accurate bill of materials (BOM).
Although each design department may have a different view on what a large assembly is, 
everyone can benefi t from the large assembly tools and strategies discussed in this chapter. 
You can create fully functional digital prototypes ranging from 10 to 100,000 components if you 
approach the task with an eye to the topics covered here.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Select a workstation
 
◆
Adjust your performance settings
 
◆
Use best practices for large assemblies
 
◆
Manage assembly detail
 
◆
Simplify parts
Selecting a Workstation
Ensuring that you have an adequate system to accomplish the type of design work you intend 
to do is an important, but often overlooked, step in achieving successful large assembly design 
with any parametric modeler. Understanding the capabilities and limitations of your computer 
and then budgeting for upgrades is a crucial part of working in today’s design world.
If you consider the time you spend waiting and the loss of work experienced when work-
ing on an undersized computer, you will likely determine that a workstation upgrade will pay 
for itself within a year. If you budget for upgrades every two years, you could argue that the 
upgrade is paying for itself in the second year of use. Although this scenario might not fi t your 
situation exactly, it demonstrates the idea that operating costs (hardware and software alike) 
should be budgeted and planned for and always measured against lost work and downtime.

464 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
Physical Memory vs. Virtual Memory
When your system runs low on physical memory (RAM) and requires more to complete an 
operation, Windows begins writing to a portion of the system hard drive known as virtual 
memory to continue. Virtual memory is often called a pagefi le.
When considering a workstation for doing large assembly design, it should be your goal to 
work in RAM as much as possible because when Windows begins to write to virtual memory, 
you will notice a considerable drop in performance. One of the weakest links in terms of speed 
on even the most adequate workstation is the hard drive. Accessing data from RAM can be 
thousands of times faster than accessing data from the hard drive. Therefore, one of the best 
ways to beef up a workstation is to simply add more RAM.
If you are running an older computer or you skimped on RAM when you upgraded, you 
will notice that as you attempt to load large assemblies or drawing fi les of large assemblies in 
Inventor, you quickly use up available RAM. You will fi nd yourself waiting for Windows to 
write data to the hard drive and then read that data. Although the unknowing user might think 
that Inventor has suddenly become slow, you should understand that no application can over-
come the hardware and operating system limitations upon which it is installed.
Autodesk recommends a minimum of 12 GB of RAM for working with large or complex 
assemblies, with 24 GB or more being ideal.
Hardware
Hardware upgrades are an important part of any design department. Budgeting properly and 
knowing what components to allocate more money to can make these upgrades more manage-
able. Dollar for dollar, you should give priority to the components described in the following 
sections, in the order listed.
RAM
When it comes to RAM, the more your system has, the better it will handle large and complex 
assemblies in Inventor. You can use the number of unique parts in your assemblies (unique parts 
as opposed to multiple instances of the same part) as a general rule of thumb when determining 
how much RAM to consider. Here is a list of recommendations based on unique part count:
 
◆
More than 5,000 unique parts: 6 GB of RAM
 
◆
More than 10,000 unique parts: 12 GB of RAM
 
◆
More than 15,000 unique parts: 18 GB of RAM
 
◆
More than 20,000 unique parts: 24 GB of RAM
Calculating the ROI of New Hardware
It’s often hard to convince management (especially nontechnical managers) that you really do need 
that new computer to get your job done. After all, you’re currently getting your work done, right? 
So why do you need the faster computer? Th is is where a return on investment (ROI) calculation 
will come in handy.

SELECTING A WORKSTATION | 465
Let’s say you routinely have to open, modify, and print large assembly drawings. To calculate the 
ROI, follow these steps:
 1. Measure how long it takes to complete this process on your old machine.
 2. Look at some benchmarks or talk to others who have faster machines, and make a conservative 
estimate of how long it would take you to do the same operations on the faster machine.
 3. Subtract the second number from the ﬁ rst. You now have your time savings per operation.
 4. Multiply this by the number of times in a day or week you perform these tasks.
 5. Multiply it by an hourly rate for your industry (you can always use your hourly salary) to get the 
dollar savings per time period (per week, month, and so on).
 6. Now you can take the cost of the new system and divide it by this cost savings per unit of time. 
Th is gives you the amount of time it will take to pay oﬀ  that new computer.
Furthermore, once this time period has passed, you are actually making money because you are 
saving the company money once the investment has been paid oﬀ . When you can show that the 
hardware will pay for itself relatively quickly, you should have fewer problems convincing manage-
ment to upgrade your equipment.
Another consideration for the ROI is who will inherit your old system. Generally, some person in 
the oﬃ  ce will also beneﬁ t from a faster system, even if they run general oﬃ  ce applications. For 
instance, if the receptionist is required to access many documents quickly across a network while 
assisting customers and other oﬃ  ce staﬀ , there is a good chance that your old CAD station will 
improve the ability to do so. Because this key person is the ﬁ rst point of information for so many 
people, the ROI is exponential. Passing old workstations to the shop ﬂ oor to allow shop staﬀ  to 
access digitally stored ﬁ les quickly is another way to achieve ROI and justify workstation upgrades.
You can check the specifi cations of your motherboard to determine how much RAM your 
system can accept. Many RAM manufactures, such as Crucial (www.crucial.com), have utilities 
on their websites that will look at your system and tell you the RAM confi gurations that your 
system can accommodate.
Graphics Cards
In the past it was generally recommended that you consider an OpenGL (developed by Silicon 
Graphics) graphics card that was tailored for CAD stations via a custom driver. Graphics card 
manufacturers and CAD developers worked together to produce and certify cards and drivers 
to offer the best results. With the introduction of Windows Vista, Autodesk began developing 
Inventor to work with Direct3D (part of Microsoft’s DirectX application programming inter-
face). Inventor 2015 was developed to work with versions of DirectX not available on earlier 
operating systems; therefore, Windows 7 with a graphics card compatible with DirectX 10 or 
newer is recommended.
With the move to Direct3D, using OpenGL and custom drivers is no longer necessary. I recom-
mend that to fi nd the best card for your workstation, you buy the card with the best performance 
within your budget. You can research cards by using a DirectX graphics processing unit benchmark 
website such as PassMark (www.cpubenchmark.net).

466 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
Gaming Cards for CAD?
In the past, high-performing gaming cards were not recommended for CAD applications because 
the drivers were developed for diﬀ erent purposes, and they often performed poorly when running 
CAD software. Now, though, with Direct3D not relying on custom drivers, gaming cards may very 
well oﬀ er the best performance for the dollar.
To ensure that Inventor has the optimal settings, select the Tools tab, click Application 
Options, and select the Hardware tab in the dialog box that opens. Inventor will automatically 
detect the appropriate level for your card, but you can set it manually to infl uence system perfor-
mance if needed. You can choose from the following settings:
Quality  This setting sacrifi ces system performance for better graphics presentation. If 
you’re running Windows 7 or Vista, anti-aliasing is turned on to improve the visual quality 
of the graphics display. For machines running Windows XP, there is no difference between 
Quality and Performance.
Performance  This setting favors system performance over graphic presentation. If you’re 
running Windows 7 or Vista, anti-aliasing is turned off. This is the default setting.
Conservative  This setting uses the same graphics processes as Inventor 2009 and earlier. 
Options such as Visual Styles and Realistic Appearance Materials are not available.
Software Graphics  This setting uses software-based graphics processing instead of 
hardware-based processing. The setting is often used to troubleshoot issues with a graph-
ics card. 
For more information and recommendations on graphics cards and other hardware, refer to 
the following website:
www.inventor-certified.com/graphics/
Hard Drives
Inventor fi les are segmented, meaning that the graphics are separate from the feature infor-
mation. When an assembly is fi rst opened, only the graphics segments are loaded. When you 
edit a fi le, the additional data is loaded at that time. This makes a fast hard drive important for 
performance.
Another aspect of hard drive performance stems from fi le storage and workspace setup. 
In Inventor, working from your local drive is the preferred method, and Autodesk has often 
recommended that you avoid working on Inventor fi les across a network (although many or 
even most Inventor users do work across a network without issue). The reason for this is sim-
ply the number of fi les that you might be editing at one time. For instance, a change to a large 
assembly could potentially modify hundreds of part fi les, requiring all those fi les to be saved 
at once. Doing this across a network, particularly one with latency issues, may result in fi le cor-
ruption if the fi les are not saved correctly. Autodesk Vault is set up to store fi les on a server and 
copy those fi les locally when checked out for editing. When working in this manner, Inventor 
has a higher performance requirement than standard offi ce applications, and the hard drive 

WORKING WITH PERFORMANCE SETTINGS | 467
workload is heavy. Therefore, it may be worth it to consider upgrading your hard drive to a 
faster drive.
Processors
When considering processors for an Inventor 2015 workstation, the chief question should 
concern multicore processors. As a minimum, you should consider a dual-core processor 
even though Inventor is not truly a multithreaded application. (Multithreaded means that the 
operating system or the application will spread the processing load across the processor.) If 
you opt for a dual-core processor, you can still take advantage of it because Inventor will run 
on one core and other applications will run on the other. There are parts of Inventor—such 
as InventorViewCompute.exe, which computes drawing views, and Inventor Studio’s ren-
dering engine—that are multithreaded, so if you work with large or complex drawings or 
plan to do a lot of image and animation rendering in Inventor, you will likely benefi t from 
more cores.
Working with Performance Settings
Whether or not upgrading workstations is an option, you should ensure that your system is set 
up for optimal performance for working with large assemblies. A number of options in Inventor 
will facilitate this.
Express Mode
Express mode accelerates fi le opening for large assembly fi les by not loading all of the assembly 
tools that Inventor offers in Full mode. Once an assembly fi le is opened in Express mode, you 
can click the Full mode button to enable the additional tools when necessary. This simple but 
effective mode switching can allow you to access your large assembly fi les an average of four to 
six times more quickly.
One of the primary differences you see when using Express mode is that you cannot edit 
components in the context of the assembly fi le. That is, when you right-click a component in the 
assembly, you will not see the Edit option. Instead, you will need to right-click and choose Open 
and then make the edits to the component. Once the edits are made, they will be refl ected in the 
assembly, even though it is still in Express mode.
To open an assembly in Express mode, you fi rst need to enable the Express mode option and 
then save the assembly fi le so that the additional Express mode information will be included 
in the fi le. You can enable Express mode by selecting the Tools tab, clicking the Application 
Options button, and then selecting the Assembly tab in the dialog box that opens. Select the 
Enable Express Mode Workfl ows option and then set the File Open Options to a unique fi le 
threshold that fi ts your typically large assembly and workstation. For instance, if your worksta-
tion typically struggles when you open an assembly that references roughly 400 unique fi les, 
you’d set this number to 400.
You can also bypass the unique fi le threshold and use Express mode to open an assembly fi le 
with fewer unique fi les by browsing to the fi le, selecting it, and then clicking the Options button 
in the Open dialog box. Here you’ll see the Open Express check box, which will force the fi le to 
open using Express mode regardless of the unique fi le number. If the Express mode check box is 

468 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
grayed out, the fi le needs to be saved with the Enable Express Mode Workfl ows option enabled 
fi rst to include the Express mode information in that fi le.
Working with Drawing Settings
Generating and hiding lines when creating and editing drawing views in Inventor can be some 
of the most processor-intensive tasks in Inventor. To help ease the demand on the system when 
you’re working with large assembly drawings, you should be aware of several settings. You can 
fi nd these settings by selecting the Tools tab, clicking Application Options, and selecting the 
Drawing tab in the dialog box that opens, as shown in Figure 9.1.
Figure 9.1
Drawing applica-
tion options

WORKING WITH PERFORMANCE SETTINGS | 469
Display Line Weights
The Display Line Weights check box enables or disables the display of unique line weights in 
drawings. Deselect the box to show lines without weight differences. Line weights will still 
print correctly, even with this box selected. Deselecting this box will speed up the performance 
of your drawing during edits and annotation work.
View Preview Display
The options in the Show Preview As drop-down box set the type of preview you get when 
creating a view. All Components is the default, but you will fi nd that selecting the Partial or 
Bounding Box option will improve performance because Inventor will not be required to create 
and update the preview as you drag your mouse pointer around the screen. The preview setting 
does not affect the drawing view result. Bounding Box previews a simple rectangle during the 
view creation, and Partial previews a simplifi ed representation of the view. Bounding Box is the 
most effi cient.
When using this option, you can still preview the assembly if you’d like by selecting the 
Preview check box in the Drawing View creation dialog box, but the default will be a simple 
bounding box. Using the Bounding Box option is suggested if you fi nd yourself waiting for the 
preview to generate during drawing view creation.
The Section View Preview As Uncut check box will also provide some performance improve-
ments when selected. This option will allow Inventor to display the section view preview as 
unsectioned in order to be more effi cient. The section view will still be generated as normal.
Enable Background Updates
When background updates are enabled, raster views are created temporarily until the compu-
tation is complete. This is indicated by green border corners on the views and a green view 
node in the browser. Raster views are simplifi ed placeholder pictures of the view, used to 
create and place the view quickly so as not to slow you down when creating views of large 
or complex models. Precise drawing views are calculated in the background while you work 
with raster views.
You can hover your mouse pointer over the drawing view node in the browser to see the 
percentage of compute progress. Heavy view computation is spread over multicore processors 
using InventorViewCompute.exe, as is evident in the Windows Task Manager.
While a view of a large assembly or complex model is computing, you can continue to create 
other views or annotations. However, some tools are disabled during view computation. These 
tools are listed here:
 
◆
Automated Centerlines
 
◆
Auto Balloon
 
◆
Project Geometry

470 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
◆
Hidden Annotations
 
◆
Model Features
Drawings containing raster views can be saved and closed while background computations 
are still working. If the drawing is closed during background updates, the updates will stop and 
be restarted the next time the drawing is opened.
BOM Views and Performance
In an assembly ﬁ le you can enable a Structured BOM view or a Parts Only BOM view using the BOM 
editor. However, if you have both views enabled, you will likely notice that your large assembly draw-
ings take longer to open. Th erefore, you should generally choose not to have both views enabled.
Memory Saving Mode
The Memory Saving Mode option sets the way Inventor loads components into memory during 
view creation. When this option is selected, Inventor loads components into memory before and 
during view creation and then unloads them from memory once the view is created.
Although memory is conserved using this mode, view creation and editing operations can-
not be undone while this option is enabled. You’ll notice that the Undo/Redo buttons will be 
grayed out after a view creation or edit. This option will also have a negative impact on perfor-
mance when you’re editing and creating views because the components must be loaded into 
memory each time. Because of this, you should consider setting this option as an application 
setting only if you always work with large assemblies.
It is generally preferred to set this option per document by selecting the Tools tab, clicking 
Documents Settings, selecting the Drawing tab in the dialog box that opens, and then setting 
the Memory Saving Mode drop-down list to Always. Figure 9.2 shows the default setting of Use 
Application Options.
Shaded Views
Also in the document settings, you can adjust the way that shaded views are displayed. Setting 
the Use Bitmap drop-down list to Always, as shown in Figure 9.2, improves performance by 
applying raster shading as opposed to a vector style. The difference impacts the display but 
typically does not affect printing.
You can also adjust the bitmap resolution; setting it lower conserves memory and speeds up 
performance. The default is 100 dpi. Setting the dpi to 200 or higher will invoke a prompt, warn-
ing you that increasing this setting for large assemblies may not be possible.

Troubleshooting Graphics Issues and Crashes
It’s often diﬃ  cult to determine the source of graphics issues and graphics-related crashes without 
knowing how to isolate and illuminate some of the variables. One of the best ways to do this is to 
go to the Hardware tab of the Application Options dialog box and set the Graphics Setting radio 
button to Software Graphics.
This setting uses Inventor, rather than your graphics card, to render the on-screen graphics. 
Th erefore, any graphics anomalies that exist while using this setting can be attributed to some-
thing other than the graphics card. If you set this option to Software Graphics and your graphics 
issues go away, your video card (or video card driver) is mostly likely the cause. If the issue returns 
when you set the option back to the recommended setting, then you should look into updating or 
rolling back your graphics card driver or getting a diﬀ erent graphics card that handles Inventor 
graphics better.
Keep in mind that this is a just a test, and I don’t recommend running Inventor using the Software 
Graphics setting all of the time, since it will cause Inventor to run slowly.

472 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
Working with Model Display Settings
When working within the modeling environment, you can adjust several settings to have a posi-
tive impact on performance. You can access these settings by selecting the Tools tab, clicking 
Application Options, and selecting the Display tab in the dialog box that opens, as shown in 
Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3
Th e Display tab in 
the Application 
Options dialog box
Appearance
All of the various display options can be controlled as application settings or as document 
settings. Using the application settings allows consistency across all of the documents that 
you work with. Document settings will adopt the settings that were used when the document 
was saved.

WORKING WITH PERFORMANCE SETTINGS | 473
Not all settings are controlled by the Appearance option, but you can defi ne useful settings 
such as displaying the model in orthographic or perspective view and what visual style you 
want active.
Display Quality
Setting the Display Quality drop-down shown in Figure 9.3 to Rough will speed up perfor-
mance by simplifying details. Navigation commands such as zooming, panning, and orbiting 
are particularly affected by this setting. If you fi nd that the rough display is not to your liking, 
you can toggle back and forth according to the size of the assembly model you are working with.
View Transition Time (Seconds)
The View Transition Time (Seconds) setting controls the time required to transition smoothly 
between views when using zooming and viewing commands. A zero transition time takes you 
from the beginning view to the end view instantaneously. For instance, if you were zoomed in 
on a small component and wanted to zoom to show all components while this slider was set to 
zero, you would not see the gradual zooming out. While this might provide a gain in perfor-
mance, understand that it can make display changes concerning position and orientation less 
clear, with the result that your adjustments would appear somewhat erratic.
Minimum Frame Rate (Hz)
You can use the Minimum Frame Rate (Hz) setting to specify how slowly the display updates 
during zooming and orbiting commands. It may be hard to see the effects of this option on a 
normal-sized part or assembly because the views will typically update more quickly than the 
rate of this setting, but with large assemblies the results become obvious as components are 
dropped from the display during zoom and orbit updates. Here is a quick description of how 
the slider setting corresponds to the frame rate:
 
◆
0 always draws everything in the view, no matter the time required.
 
◆
1 tries to draw the view at least one frame per second. (Inventor will simplify or discard 
parts of the view if needed but will restore them when movement ends.)
 
◆
5 draws at least fi ve frames per second, 10 draws at least ten frames per second, and so on, 
up to a maximum of 20. Using the maximum frame rate of 20 will speed up zoom and orbit 
operations and give you the best results for large assemblies.
The settings in the Display tab can affect the performance of the system as well as the user’s 
comfort when working in Inventor.
Working with General Settings
The following sections describe a few general settings that you can adjust to help the perfor-
mance of large assemblies. You can access these settings by selecting the Tools tab, clicking 
Application Options, and selecting the General tab in the dialog box that opens. That tab is 
shown in Figure 9.4.

Default application 
options
Update Physical Properties On Save
When checked, the Update Physical Properties On Save setting, located in the Physical 
Properties area on the right side of the dialog box, recalculates the mass properties of the model 
when you save the fi le. This ensures that mass properties are up-to-date. Setting this to Parts 
Only will ensure that the parts are all up-to-date without requiring you to wait on the recalcula-
tion for large assemblies. Note that this setting is disabled altogether by default but is recom-
mended to be set to Parts Only if you fi nd it helpful. Note too that the same function can be 
performed manually from the Bill Of Materials Editor and the Manage tab.
Undo File Size
The Undo File Size option, on the lower-right side of the dialog box, sets the maximum size 
of the temporary fi le that records changes to a fi le so that actions can be undone. It’s typically 
required to increase the size of this setting when working with large models and drawings 

WORKING WITH PERFORMANCE SETTINGS | 475
because each undo action is typically a larger calculation. Autodesk recommends adjusting this 
in 4 MB increments.
Enable Optimized Selection
The Enable Optimized Selection setting, located on the lower-right corner of the dialog box, 
improves the performance of graphics during prehighlighting in large assemblies. When the 
Enable Optimized Selection setting is activated, the algorithm for the Select Other function 
fi lters for only the group of objects closest to the screen. If you click through this fi rst group of 
objects, the next group is considered for highlighting.
Status Bar
The status bar displays information concerning the number of fi les being accessed by Inventor, 
at the bottom-right corner of the Inventor screen, as shown in Figure 9.5. The number to the left 
is the total number of occurrences of all components in the active document. The next number is 
the total number of fi les open in the Inventor session.

Using the Memory Probe
Included in your install of Inventor is a utility designed to monitor memory use for your sys-
tem. The MemProbe utility, shown in Figure 9.6, looks at the Inventor process and displays its 
use of physical and virtual memory. It can often be useful in troubleshooting issues of capacity 
and slow performance. You can fi nd this tool at the following location: C:\Program Files\
Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Bin\memprobe.exe. You might fi nd it useful to create a desktop 
shortcut to it, if you fi nd yourself using it often.
Working with System Settings
You can adjust several settings in the operating system to help with performance. Inventor users 
commonly set the pagefi le size to twice the amount of RAM to gain performance. There are also 
many visual effects that you may have grown accustomed to that actually cost you resources. If 
you are serious about turning your workstation into a large-assembly workhorse, it is advisable 
to disable these features.
Adjusting the Virtual Memory Paging File Size
To change the size of the virtual memory paging fi le in Windows 7, right-click the Computer 
icon and choose Properties. On the System Properties tab, click the Advanced System Settings 
tab, click Performance Options, and, fi nally, under Virtual Memory, deselect Automatically 
Manage Paging File Size For All Drives. Then click Change.

Windows 7 is set to an Automatic or System Managed paging fi le size. If you choose to set 
a Custom paging fi le size, you should refer to the recommended size that the dialog box offers 
and set the minimum and maximum to the same value to minimize fragmentation of the pag-
ing fi le if it needs to expand. Figure 9.7 shows the Virtual Memory dialog box.

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 477
Setting Virtual Memory
Search the Internet and you will ﬁ nd hundreds of incorrect theories as to how to set the values for 
your virtual memory. One of the major myths is that you should set the initial and maximum to 
diﬀ erent values. If you are dedicating a portion of your hard drive for a pageﬁ le, why start it small 
and then let it grow? Just provide the maximum amount of space you can and let it be.
Disabling Common Visual Effects
Windows provides many options to set the visual effects of your computer. Many of them have 
a surprisingly high impact on performance when memory is scarce. Here are a few you might 
consider disabling in order to conserve resources:
Screen Saver  To disable the screen saver, you can right-click your desktop and choose 
Personalize; then set the Screen Saver option to None. While you are working, screen savers 
are just another running process. You may want to set the Power Saving Mode option to turn 
off the monitor after a certain amount of time. If you use an LCD monitor, understand that 
screen savers do nothing to save an LCD screen.
Visual Settings  Many of the fade and shadow settings used in Windows look nice but 
come with a performance price if your system is on the slow side. To adjust these settings, 
you can right-click your desktop and choose Personalize; then select the Windows Classic 
theme.
Screen Resolution  If you’re fortunate enough to have a nice, large-screen monitor, you 
probably have set up the screen resolution to maximize your space. However, this may be 
working against your large assembly pursuits. Experiment with setting the screen resolution 
to a lower setting such as 1024×768 to see whether you gain any performance when working 
with large assemblies.
Large Assembly Best Practices
Oftentimes, Inventor users don’t think about large assembly performance until it has already 
become an issue with the model on which they are working. It is possible for two Inventor users 
working on two identical workstations to create two seemingly identical models, and yet those 
two models might perform in dramatically different ways.
If the fi rst user has been mindful of large assembly management all along, his model and 
drawings will be much easier to open and work with. If the second user concentrated only on 
her design and gave no thought to the memory demands of the fi les she was creating, her model 
will be slow to open and work with and ultimately more likely to cause application crashes and 
data corruption. When the next job comes along, user 1 can reuse his model to create a similar 
design, whereas user 2 will likely re-create the assembly model because she does not trust the 
integrity of the fi rst model she created.
Understanding where performance savings can be gained as you create the model will pay 
off once the large assembly is created and will make it much more manageable to work with 
along the way. And of course, a large assembly model can be revisited and cleaned up according 

478 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
to best practices to make it more manageable as well. Either way, having a model that is manage-
able and can be reused for similar work in the future should always be your goal.
You should be considering assembly performance when creating and editing a model, when 
opening the model, and also when detailing and annotating the model.
Working with the Model
You can use several methods to ensure that your large assembly will not become unmanageable. 
It is important to remember that the term large assembly is subjective. To you a large assembly 
may be 200 components, whereas it may be 20,000 to someone else. Either way, following best 
practices ensure that you are developing good procedural habits and are prepared for the day 
when you are asked to design a much larger assembly than you typically do today.
As was discussed earlier in this chapter, hardware limitations might be an obstacle that you 
cannot overcome even if you follow every best practice, but you’ll need to follow these practices 
to know that for certain. Conversely, even if you have a workstation that is extremely capable, 
you will still benefi t by developing good work habits and making your models easier to handle 
on less-capable workstations of others you collaborate with.
Improving File Open Time
It is a good practice to shut down Inventor and other Windows applications if you will be leav-
ing them for an extended period of time. Closing these applications can allow the system to free 
up memory “leaked” by drivers and subroutines that take up memory when executed but do not 
release it when fi nished, even if you don’t use those functions again.
When working with large datasets, shutting down the application and reloading the model 
can be time-consuming. There is a default setting on the File tab of the Application Options dia-
log box that saves the last-opened assembly and its component fi les in cache. You can also defi ne 
a specifi c fi le to be kept so that you can work with others and maintain the benefi ts of the Quick 
File Open setting for a specifi c assembly.
Reducing Assembly Constraints
Using subassemblies within upper-level assemblies can reduce assembly constraints. The 
importance of this concept cannot be overstated. Reducing assembly constraints can eliminate 
the number of redundant calculations Inventor must make to solve your model, and therefore 
it pays off immediately in that respect. The improved organization and ability to reuse compo-
nents already organized into subassemblies is a benefi t that may be realized in the future.
To reorganize an assembly that has not been created using subassemblies, you can use the 
Demote option. To explore this concept, let’s make some changes to an assembly:
 
1. Open the fi le mi_9a_001.iam located in the Chapter 09 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder. If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 9 fi les from 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” 
section of the introduction for the download and setup instructions.
Although not a large assembly by anyone’s standard, this assembly has been created 
without using subassemblies to demonstrate the ability to demote components into 
subassemblies from the top down. Currently, this assembly has a total of 31 constraints 
being used at the top-level assembly. Your goal is to restructure this assembly into three 

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 479
subassemblies so that you can reduce constraints and create subassemblies that can be 
used in other stapler designs.
 
2. At the top of the Model browser, you’ll see the words Assembly View with a drop-down 
arrow next to them. Use the drop-down arrow to change the browser view to model-
ing view.
Assembly View  Displays assembly constraints and connections nested below the as-
sembly components, as well as in the Relationships folder. Part modeling features are 
hidden.
Modeling View  Displays all assembly constraints and connections in a folder named 
Relationships at the top of the browser tree. Each part’s modeling features are dis-
played below the part.
 
3. Click the plus sign next to the Relationships folder found at the top of the browser tree 
to display the list of all the constraints in the assembly.
 
4. In the Model browser, select all the components with a prefi x of 100.
 
5. Once you’ve selected those components, right-click and choose Component ➢ Demote, as 
shown in Figure 9.8.
Figure 9.8
Demoting com-
ponents to a 
subassembly
 
6. You are presented with a Create In-Place Component dialog box, where you can specify 
the name of the new subassembly, the template fi le, the fi le location, and the default BOM 
structure. Enter 100 for the name, set the BOM structure to Phantom, and then click OK.
Phantom Subassemblies
Setting a subassembly as Phantom prevents it from being listed in the bill of materials while still 
allowing the parts contained within the subassembly to be listed.

480 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
7. Click Yes in the warning stating that assembly constraints will be moved with the 
demoted components, shown in Figure 9.9.
Figure 9.9
Restructuring com-
ponents warning
This warning simply states that any constraints between the 100-series parts and the 
200- and 300-series parts will now be redefi ned to be between subassembly 100 and 
the 200- and 300-series parts. The constraints between the 100-series parts and other 
100-series parts are maintained in subassembly 100.
This is important in large assemblies because it can signifi cantly reduce the number of 
constraints used. Consider the fi ve components you selected to demote in the stapler. If 
these components all had just one assembly constraint, each relating it to some part that 
will not be in the new subassembly, those fi ve constraints will be discarded.
Continuing with the example, you should now see the subassembly named 100.iam in 
the Model browser. Because of the restructure, you will need to ground the assembly so 
that it cannot be accidentally moved. Then you can continue to demote components into 
another subassembly.
 
8. Right-click 100.iam and click Grounded to set it in place.
 
9. In the Model browser, select all the components with a prefi x of 200.
 
10. Right-click and choose Component ➢ Demote.
 
11. Enter 200 for the name, set the BOM structure to Phantom, and then click OK. Click Yes 
in the warning dialog box.
 
12. Repeat the steps for demoting for all the components with a prefi x of 300 until your 
browser looks like Figure 9.10.
Figure 9.10
Subassemblies cre-
ated by demoting

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 481
If you look in the Relationships folder at the top of the browser tree, you’ll see that the 
number of constraints that exist at the top level of the assembly has been reduced considerably.
You can also restructure components by dragging a component listed in the assembly 
browser, either in or out of a subassembly browser node. Moving components up out of a sub-
assembly is called promoting rather than demoting. Because you can promote or demote uncon-
strained and underconstrained components, you may need to edit the subassembly and ensure 
that components are constrained properly within that subassembly.
Assembly Constraint and Adaptivity Options
Th ere are three Application Options settings to be aware of that can impact assembly performance. 
When working with large assemblies, you might want to have all three of these options deselected. 
You can ﬁ nd them by selecting the Tools tab, clicking the Application Options button, and then 
selecting the Assembly tab. Th e options are as follows:
 
◆
Enable Relationship Redundancy Analysis
 
◆
Enable Related Relationship Failure Analysis 
 
◆
Features Are Initially Adaptive
Adaptivity
Too many cross-part adaptive features can cripple the performance of even a modest-sized 
assembly if used without discretion. As discussed in Chapter 8, “Assembly Design Workfl ows,” 
adaptivity should generally be turned off once the adaptive feature or part is created.
Often features and parts are made adaptive during the early design stages of a model, when 
changes are made quickly and you want many parts to follow these changes. Turning off the 
adaptive status in the part ensures that your assembly performance will not be affected. If 
the adaptive part needs to be edited, you can turn on its adaptive status so that you can make 
adjustments.
Many times parts become adaptive by default when a new part or feature is created in an 
assembly, because a reference sketch is projected from one part to another. You can disable 
this by clicking Application Options on the Tools tab, selecting the Assembly tab in the dialog 
box that opens, and then deselecting the Enable Associative Edge/Loop Geometry Projection 
During In-Place Modeling option under Cross Part Geometry Projection.
You can also hold the Ctrl key while selecting individual edges for projection into your 
sketch. This works only when you’re selecting individual edges. Selecting a face will build an 
adaptive relationship. Either technique will create fewer accidental adaptive parts but may 
require more manual effort in projecting geometry across parts.
Selection Tools
When working with a large assembly, combing through all the many parts within that assembly 
that you want to select for a given task can be time-consuming and diffi cult if you attempt to 
locate them using the standard Pan, Zoom, and Orbit methods. Instead, make yourself familiar 
with the options in the assembly selection tools.

482 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
You can use selection tools to suppress sets of components based on such factors as size, 
internal components that are not visible because of the presence of external housings, and so on. 
For instance, to maintain performance, you may not want to load all the internal components 
into memory when they are not important to your current design task. Once you’ve selected 
the internal components, you can suppress them and create an external-part-only level of detail 
representation. If you haven’t created level of detail (LOD) representations before, you can fi nd 
information on how to do so in Chapter 8. 
Another use of assembly selection tools is to create view representations in the assembly to 
aid in the creation of views in the drawing fi le. As an example, when you place a view in the 
drawing using a design view that was created with the All In Camera tool, only the components 
in the screen view plane are calculated. This increases performance and memory capacity. 
Figure 9.11 shows the available selection tools.
Figure 9.11
Available selec-
tion tools
The following selection tools are available:
Select Component Priority  Sets the selection to pick up the topmost structure level of com-
ponents. If set, this will pick up subassemblies and not their children.
Select Part Priority  Sets the tool to select parts, no matter what their subassembly 
structure. 
Select Body Priority  Sets the tool to select solid bodies within their parent part fi le, no mat-
ter what their subassembly structure. This option works best when using the Modeling view. 
When using the Assembly view, the Find In Browser option does not work.
Select Feature Priority  Selects individual features rather than the parts that contain them.
Select Faces And Edges  Allows you to highlight and select faces or the curves that defi ne 
those faces.

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 483
Select Sketch Features  Allows you to highlight and select sketches or the curves that 
defi ne those sketches.
Select Visible Only  Selects only visible components in a selection set.
Enable Prehighlight  Displays prehighlighting when your cursor moves over an object. 
This does not affect the Select Other tool, which always shows prehighlighting.
Invert Selection  Deselects all components previously selected, and selects all components 
previously unselected.
Previous Selection  Reselects all components in the previous selection set.
Select All Occurrences  Selects all instances in the current fi le of the selected component.
Select Constrained To  Selects all components constrained to a preselected component or 
components.
Select Component Size  Selects components by the percent set in the Select By Size box. 
Size is determined by the diagonal of the bounding box of the components. Click the arrow 
to select a component and measure its size to use as a scale. Figure 9.12 shows the Select By 
Size dialog box.
Figure 9.12
Select By Size 
dialog box
Select Component Offset  Selects components fully or partially contained within the 
bounding box of a selected component plus a specifi ed offset distance.
Select Sphere Offset  Selects components fully or partially contained within the bounding 
sphere of a selected component plus a specifi ed offset distance.
Select By Plane  Selects components fully or partially intersected by a specifi ed face or 
plane.
Select External Components  Selects external components based on a percentage of the 
component’s viewable surface.
Select Internal Components  Selects internal components based on a percentage of the 
component’s viewable surface.
Select All In Camera  Selects all components in the current view screen based on a percent-
age of the component’s viewable surface.
Using the Feature Selection Filter to Select Work Planes
It can be a major pain to try to select a work plane while in a busy assembly ﬁ le. To make it easier, 
use the Select Feature Priority ﬁ lter or the Select Faces And Edges ﬁ lter. Your cursor will no longer 
select parts but only features, making it easy to select even the most obscured work planes.

484 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
View Representations
View representations are often used in large assemblies to navigate to a predefi ned view-
ing angle so that you do not have to tax your system with heavy graphics regeneration. For 
instance, if you have an assembly that contains an entire production line of material-handling 
equipment, you may fi nd it diffi cult to orbit around to the backside of the assembly to com-
plete a simple task such as selecting a face or just looking at the assembly. If you set a design 
view before orbiting and then set another once you have orbited to the desired view, you can 
then easily toggle between the two views of this assembly, thereby increasing performance 
during navigation between these predefi ned views.
View representations have other large-assembly benefi ts as well. When creating a drawing 
view of a large assembly, you can specify a preset view representation and reduce the time it 
takes to create the drawing view. If you have turned off the visibility of some components in the 
assembly view representation, the drawing view can generate even faster and provide you with 
a clearer and more concise view. Of course, if you already have the assembly open when creat-
ing the drawing view, the components are likely already loaded into memory.
Another way that the experienced Inventor user may use view representations is to navigate 
the Model browser. For instance, if you set up a view representation to zoom in on a particu-
lar subassembly so that you can navigate to that component quickly, you can save that view 
representation while the entire model tree is rolled up and only the subassembly of interest is 
expanded. This browser state will be saved within the view representation.
Once a view representation is created, you can right-click it and choose Copy To Level Of 
Detail to copy the view representation to an LOD representation. This allows you to transfer the 
visibility settings from the view representation to the LOD where they will be suppressed. In 
this way, you do not have to duplicate the process of turning parts off.
Find
Navigating a large-assembly Model browser can be a chore. To help with this, you can employ 
the Find tool to defi ne search criteria for constraints, components, features, sketches, and welds. 
Searches can be saved for future use and recalled as needed using the Open Search button, 
shown in Figure 9.13.
You can access the Find tool in the following ways:
 
◆
From within a fi le, click the binoculars icon in the Model browser.
 
◆
In the Inventor Open dialog box, click the Find button.
Opening the Model
One of the most important aspects of working on a large assembly fi le is being able to open the 
fi le. Although this seems obvious, many Inventor users seem to approach opening a model as 
an afterthought. Consider it in this way—if you were tasked with carrying a pile of stones up a 
fl ight of stairs, you would probably be unlikely to attempt to carry them all up the stairs at once. 
But this is exactly the kind of heavy lifting you are asking your workstation to do when opening 
a large assembly.
To allow your workstation to make multiple trips when opening an assembly fi le, you will 
use LOD representations. You create LOD representations by suppressing components in an 
assembly. Once the LOD is created, you can access it the next time you begin to open the fi le by 

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 485
using the Options button, shown in Figure 9.14. Once the assembly fi le is open, you can unsup-
press components as required, and those components will then be loaded into memory. You 
can also specify a default LOD so that the assembly opens to it without your having to use the 
Options dialog box every time. This is done from Application Options on the Assembly tab. 
You’ll learn more about creating LODs later, in the “Managing Assembly Detail” section of this 
chapter.
Figure 9.13
Th e Find tool in 
an assembly ﬁ le
Figure 9.14
Opening LODs
If you need to open a large assembly that has not been properly managed, you may fi nd 
yourself having to locate or skip a number of parts and subassemblies. This can be a tedious 

486 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
task, but the Skip All Unresolved Files option in the File Open dialog will bypass locating miss-
ing components and load the members of the assembly that can be located automatically.
LOD in Subassemblies
Often, you might create a complex assembly model as a stand-alone design because you need to 
insert that model into an upper-level assembly as part of a larger system. Because the original 
design was required to generate production drawings and an accurate BOM, it includes all the 
components in the design.
However, because you will be placing multiple instances of this subassembly, you want to avoid 
placing it at the full level of detail. You might create an LOD in the subassembly where all internal 
components, all external hardware, and all internal and external fasteners are suppressed, leaving 
only the external housing and frame components.
LOD representations of subassemblies can be accessed from the Options button in the Place 
Component dialog box when you are placing them into upper-level assemblies. By placing a subas-
sembly at a reduced level of detail, you have created a much smaller, top-level assembly ﬁ le and yet 
still have the ability to pull an accurate BOM even from the top-level assembly.
Working with Large Assembly Drawings
Although large assembly fi les require some forethought and management; so do the drawing 
fi les of these large assemblies. Because Inventor generates the line work from the models that 
you create views from automatically, it is easy to take for granted the large number of calcula-
tions required to do this. Stop for a moment and consider all the hidden lines, sectioned parts, 
and so on, that Inventor has to consider in order to render your drawing views accurately.
It is for this reason that you will want to adopt slightly different techniques than those you 
use to make part or small assembly drawings. If you have not yet worked with Inventor’s draw-
ing environment much at this point, you can fi nd more information specifi c to Inventor draw-
ings in Chapter 12, “Documentation.” Keep in mind that many of the options mentioned in this 
section are covered in more depth in Chapter 12.
Working with High-Speed Raster Views
You can enable an option to create raster views for large or complex models. When enabled, a 
draft preview of a drawing view will be displayed while the precise drawing view is calculated 
in the background. Raster drawing views enable you to continue to work and annotate the 
drawing while the precise calculation of a drawing view is completed.
To enable a raster view, you can use either of two methods. One creates a raster view until the 
view calculation is complete, at which time it converts to a precise view. The other option main-
tains the view as a raster view until you choose to make it a precise view. 
To enable temporary raster view creation, select the Drawing tab of the Application Options 
dialog box and then select the Enable Background Updates option (toward the bottom) to use 
raster views. By default this option is not selected. This setting will create the view as a raster 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 487
view but will allow the raster view to convert to a precise view when the calculations are 
complete. 
To create views that persist as raster views, you can select the Raster View Only check box 
found at the bottom of the Drawing View creation dialog box, as shown in Figure 9.15. To con-
vert a raster view to a precise view once it has been created, you can right-click the view and 
choose Make View Precise. You can convert it back to a raster view by right-clicking again and 
choosing Make View Raster.
Figure 9.15
Creating a raster 
drawing view 
from an LOD
Raster views are indicated by green corner glyphs in the graphic window and by either the 
green circular arrows icon in the browser if the view is calculating toward becoming precise 
or a red slash across the view icon in the browser for a static raster view. If you place your 
cursor on a calculating raster view icon, you’ll see a tool tip showing the progress of precise 
calculation. 
Several features are not available or will work differently while the precise views are being 
calculated and the raster view is displayed. This alternative functionality is intended to handle 
the situations where the less-detailed raster views might cause confusion or problems.
These features are not available for raster views:
 
◆
Automated Centerlines cannot be created for raster views.
 
◆
Auto Balloons cannot be used for raster views.
 
◆
Model Features cannot be selected as edges in raster views.
These features work differently for raster views:
 
◆
Tangent model edges are always shown in raster views, and their properties or visibility 
cannot be edited.
 
◆
Interference edges are not shown in raster views.
 
◆
Reference Parts might have incomplete geometry in raster views.
 
◆
Hole Tables are not available to use the View and Feature options for raster views.

488 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
◆
Thread Annotations are not displayed in raster views. New or existing thread notes are 
attached to thread features after views turn precise.
 
◆
Printing when a drawing includes raster views provides three options: You can print the 
current precise views, wait until all views are precise, or cancel the print. However, I do not 
recommend you print raster views because geometry on printed raster views can be differ-
ent from the fi nal precise views.
 
◆
Export to AutoCAD DWG, DWF, DXF, or PDF cannot be completed for a drawing with ras-
ter views. If a precise view calculation is in progress, a progress bar is displayed. You can 
wait until the calculation fi nishes or cancel the export.
 
◆
Save and Close for drawings containing raster views can be executed as expected. If the fi le 
is closed and reopened, the raster views are automatically recalculated as precise.
Creating Large Assembly Drawing Views
When creating drawings of large assemblies, it is advised that you do so from an LOD represen-
tation already created in the model. Doing so reduces the number of fi les Inventor is required 
to access to create and update the line work in the view. To create views from assembly repre-
sentations, you specify the representations you want to use in the Drawing View dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 9.15 earlier. Keep in mind that when browsing for the fi le to create a view 
of, if you use the Options button in the Open dialog box to specify the representation, you will 
reduce the time it takes to create the view.
Although using LODs will help with drawing views, be aware that because Inventor employs 
a global bill of materials, as soon as you place a parts list, balloon, or other annotation referenc-
ing the bill of materials, the number of fi les loaded into memory increases to include all of the 
parts in the bill of materials. This situation somewhat defeats the purpose of the LOD tools, but 
currently no solution is available.
View Preview Display
If you ﬁ nd yourself waiting for the preview of your assembly to generate before being able to 
proceed with view creation options, you will want to change the preview display to use bounding 
boxes and then enable the preview on ﬁ les as required on a case-by-case basis by clicking the pre-
view icon shown at the bottom left of Figure 9.15. Note that enabling/disabling the preview is an 
option only when using the Bounding Box or Partial option. To ﬁ nd this setting, select the Tools 
tab, click Application Options, select the Drawing tab in the dialog box that opens, and look in the 
View Preview Display section.
Reducing Hidden Lines
Hidden-line generation can be one of the most memory-intensive aspects of creating a drawing 
view. Generally, with large assemblies it is not desirable to show the hidden lines of all compo-
nents. Instead, you typically will want to enable hidden lines for just those components where 
hidden lines add clarity.

LARGE ASSEMBLY BEST PRACTICES | 489
Rather than selecting the Hidden Line style in the Drawing View dialog box, fi rst create the 
view with no hidden lines. Next, locate and expand the view you just created in the browser, 
and select the components you intend to be shown with hidden lines. Right-click the compo-
nents, and choose Hidden Lines.
You will be prompted with a message box informing you that you are changing the view 
style to show hidden lines and that any children of this view will be granted an independent 
view style based on their current setting, as shown in Figure 9.16. The result will be that only 
the components you chose will be displayed with hidden lines.

den lines
Creating Title Block Logos
A sure way to slow down your drawing’s performance is to create an unnecessarily complex 
title block. If you have included a bitmap of your company logo in your title block, ensure that 
the bitmap fi le is reduced in resolution and fi le size as much as possible. You can use any photo 
editor to do this.
Once you’ve reduced the bitmap fi le as much as possible, consider embedding the fi le into the 
title block rather than linking it. Although linking the bitmap does give you greater fl exibility in 
updating the logo independent of the title block, Inventor will be required to locate the bitmap 
each time the drawing is loaded. To embed rather than link the logo bitmap, simply deselect the 
Link check box when inserting the bitmap.
If you have pasted the logo in from Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, ensure that the logo is 
as clean as possible. You may be better off removing the hatches from the logo in AutoCAD and 
then adding them using the Fill/Hatch Sketch Region tool in Inventor.
Reducing the Number of Sheets and Views per Drawing File
Although it is possible to create a large number of sheets in a single drawing fi le, it is generally 
accepted that this is not good practice. Instead, you should consider making a new fi le for each 
drawing sheet when possible. Or at the very least, keep the number of sheets per fi le as low as 
possible. There are two primary reasons for doing so.
The fi rst reason is simply to keep the fi le size down. If you have a drawing of a large assem-
bly fi le that includes four sheets and has a fi le size of 80 MB, you could split this into two fi les, 
each with two sheets and a fi le size of approximately 40 MB. In this way, you do not need to load 
the extra 40 MB in sheets 3 and 4 just to make an edit to sheet 1.

490 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
The second reason to minimize drawing sheets is so you are not guilty of placing all your 
eggs in one basket. Creating multiple tab or sheet fi les in any application can be risky. Imagine 
you created a load calculation spreadsheet and you developed the habit of adding a tab for 
each new calculation you do rather than creating a new fi le for each calculation. If the fi le 
becomes corrupt, you’ve lost all your calculations rather than just one set of calculations. The 
same thing could happen with your Inventor drawing if you habitually create new sheets 
instead of new fi les.
Managing Assembly Detail
In Chapter 8, you learned about creating LOD representations within your assemblies to reduce 
the memory requirements of working with large assemblies. Here you will consider how you 
can use these LOD representations to handle large assemblies more effi ciently.
LOD Strategies
All Inventor assemblies have four default LODs predefi ned and ready for you to use. Learning 
to use them and creating your own LODs is an important part of working with large assemblies. 
The default LODs are as follows:
Master  This LOD shows your assembly with no parts suppressed. You can think of it as the 
highest level of detail for any assembly.
All Components Suppressed  This LOD suppresses everything within the assembly. You 
can think of it as the lowest level of detail for any assembly.
All Parts Suppressed  This LOD suppresses all parts at all levels of the assembly, but subas-
semblies are loaded.
All Content Center Suppressed  This LOD suppresses any component in the assembly that 
is stored in the Content Center Files directory as designated by the IPJ (project) fi le or the 
Application Options settings.
When opening a large assembly, you can use the All Components Suppressed LOD to 
quickly open the fi le and then manually unsuppress components as required. However, it is 
more practical to create your own LODs and use them to effi ciently open your assemblies. 
Consider creating intermediate LODs based on your design process.
For a closer look at LODs in action, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_9a_002.iam from the Chapter 09 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the Representations folder and the Level Of Detail node in the Model browser 
if they are not already expanded.
 
4. Right-click the Level Of Detail header and choose New Level Of Detail. Change the name 
from LevelofDetail1 to MediumLOD.

5. In the Quick Access toolbar (along the top of the screen), click the selection tool drop-
down list (see Figure 9.17) and set your selection focus to Select Component Priority if it 
is not already.
 
6. Using the same drop-down list, now choose Internal Components, shown in Figure 9.17.

9. Now you’ll bring back one component to add to your selection set. Select the component 
called MA- 001:1 in the browser, right-click, and choose Visibility. You should see the 
motor subassembly become visible.
 
10. Select all the components on the screen. You can use a crossing window to do this 
quickly.
 
11. Right-click and choose Suppress.
 
12. Right-click anywhere and choose Undo Isolate to bring back the visibility of the remain-
ing unsuppressed components.
 
13. Save the assembly to ensure that the changes to your newly created level of detail are 
recorded.

492 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
14. Switch back and forth between the master LOD and your MediumLOD to observe the 
differences.
 
15. To modify MediumLOD, activate it and suppress any component you’d like; then save the 
assembly.
In the preceding steps you used selection fi lters to quickly select the internal parts and then 
used the Isolate tool to toggle the visibility setting of the unselected components. Then you 
suppressed the visible components. Understand that it is the Suppress option that creates and 
modifi es LOD representations. Changing visibility affects only view representations and has 
no impact on the LOD. When you’ve fi nished experimenting with this fi le, you can close it and 
continue to the next section.
Substitute LODs
You can use substitute LOD representations to trade out a large multipart assembly with a single 
part derived from that assembly. Substitute LODs improve effi ciency by reducing the number 
of fi les Inventor is referencing and, if created from other LODs, can also reduce the amount of 
geometry required.
For example, in the blower assembly, you could create a substitute LOD from the entire 
assembly and then place that substitute into a top-level assembly as needed. You would cer-
tainly gain some effi ciency by doing this because the top-level assembly is referencing only one 
fi le. However, if you created a substitute from MediumLOD, you would be maintaining an even 
higher level of performance in the top-level assembly because all the internal geometry that was 
suppressed in the creation of that LOD would be omitted.
To create a substitute LOD, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose Open.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_9a_003.iam located in the Chapter 09 directory of the Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click Open.
 
3. Expand the Representations folder and the Level Of Detail node in the Model browser 
if they are not already expanded.
 
4. Double-click MediumLOD to set it as the active LOD if not already done.
 
5. Right-click the Level Of Detail header in the browser and choose New Substitute and 
then Shrinkwrap. Notice that Inventor is asking you to specify a fi lename, a fi le template, 
and a location to create this fi le.
 
6. Enter mi 9a 003 Substitute 100 for the name in the New Derived Substitute Part dialog 
box and leave the template and fi le location at the defaults.
 
7. Click OK. Inventor opens a new part fi le and takes you directly into the shrinkwrap pro-
cess, bringing up the Assembly Shrinkwrap Options dialog box.
 
8. In the Style area at the top, ensure that the Single Composite Feature option is selected. 
The following are the descriptions of each of the four available options:
Single Solid Body Merging Out Seams Between Planar Faces  Produces a single solid 
body without seams. Merged faces become a single color, where required.
Solid Body Keep Seams Between Planar Faces  Produces a single solid body with 
seams. Colors are retained.

MANAGING ASSEMBLY DETAIL | 493
Maintain Each Solid As A Solid Body  Produces a single part fi le with multiple bodies. 
This is the closest approximation to an assembly.
Single Composite Feature  Produces a single surface composite feature and the smallest 
fi le. Colors and seams of the original components are maintained. The mass properties of 
the original assembly are stored in the fi le for reference.
 
9. Ensure that the Remove Geometry By Visibility check box is selected.
 
10. Select Whole Parts Only.
 
11. Play around with the slider, clicking the Preview button to see what is removed.
 
12. Set the slider to 78 percent.
 
13. Under Hole Patching, select All.
 
14. Ensure that Reduced Memory Mode is selected at the bottom of the dialog box. When 
selected, this option allows the derived part to be created using less memory by not 
including the source bodies of the assembly parts.
 
15. Refer to Figure 9.19 to check the settings and then click OK.

16. Click Yes when asked about the mass properties. Note that Inventor closes the derived 
part fi le and returns to the assembly and that an LOD named SubstituteLevelofDetail1 
has been created. You can rename it if you like by clicking it once and then a second time.
 
17. Save the assembly.
 
18. Double-click MediumLOD to set it as active and compare the substitute LOD by clicking 
back and forth between the two.
 
19. To see that the substitute shrinkwrap is a surface model, click the View tab and choose 
the Half Section View icon from the drop-down list on the Appearance panel.
 
20. Click Workplane2 in the Model browser.
 
21. Right-click and choose Done.
 
22. Choose End Section View from the drop-down list on the Appearance panel to turn off 
the section view.
Figure 9.20 shows the substitute LOD as it appears in the browser.
Figure 9.20
Substitute LOD
Recall that all LODs maintain an accurate BOM listing. To confi rm this, select the Assemble 
tab, click Bill Of Materials, and interrogate the BOM to see that even though the substitute LOD 
consists of a single part, Inventor still maintains the BOM information for the entire assembly. 
You can close this fi le without saving changes and move on to the next section.
Subassembly LODs
Subassembly use is where LOD representations really begin to pay off in terms of performance. 
Once LOD representations have been created in your assembly, you can switch the LOD in the 
subassemblies to match in three ways:
 
◆
Place the subassemblies into a top-level assembly with the matching LOD by using the 
Options button.
 
◆
Switch the LOD manually in the subassembly in the Model browser.
 
◆
Use the Link Levels Of Detail tool at the top-level assembly to automatically set the subas-
semblies to the matching LOD.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

MANAGING ASSEMBLY DETAIL | 495
In Figure 9.21, all of the subassemblies contain LODs named Frame Layout, Exhaust 
Connection, and Harness Layout set up within them. These LODs were linked using the Link 
Levels of Detail tool, as indicated in the browser by the LOD name shown in parentheses next to 
the assembly name.
Figure 9.21
Nested LODs 
with a consistent 
naming scheme
You might take this concept one step further and edit your assembly templates to automati-
cally include standard LOD names already in them. This way you do not have to create the 
LODs, but instead you can simply activate them and then suppress parts as required to “fi ll 
them out.”
Recall that Inventor specifi es your template location on the File tab of the Application 
Options dialog box. Note that this can be overridden in your project fi le. Check this by selecting 
the Get Started tab and then clicking the Projects button, and look in the Folder Options section 
of the Project File Editor that opens. If a path is specifi ed there, that is where your templates are 
located. If it shows = Default, the path found in Application Options is where your templates are 
located.
In the following exercise, the subassemblies all have LODs created in them. These are called 
Bolts, Washers, Nuts, and Galvanized. Each subassembly was confi gured with these LODs set 
up as described in the previous exercise. The top-level assembly has three LODs created, called 
Bolts, Washers, and Nuts. Although these LODs have been created, they have not been confi g-
ured and currently do not differ from the master LOD. The following steps take you through the 
linking of the Bolt LOD at the top-level assembly to the Bolt LODs in the subassemblies:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_9a_004.iam from the Chapter 09 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the Representations folder and the Level Of Detail node in the Model browser.

496 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
4. Double-click the LOD named Bolts to set it active, or right-click it and choose Activate.
 
5. Click the Assemble tab, expand the drop-down list for the Productivity panel and choose 
Link Levels Of Detail.
 
6. Click Bolts in the Link Levels Of Detail dialog box.
 
7. Click OK in the Link Levels Of Detail dialog box and click OK to accept the warning that 
the assembly will be saved.
Note that the subassemblies have all been set so that the Bolts LOD is active in them. If one 
of the subassemblies did not have an LOD called Bolts, it would be left at its current LOD. You 
can continue this exercise by repeating these steps for the Washers and Nuts LODs if you’d like. 
Note too that each of the subassemblies has an LOD called Galvanized in which all parts that 
are not galvanized steel have been suppressed. You can create an LOD called Galvanized in 
the top-level assembly and then use the Link LODs tool to suppress all the parts not made of 
galvanized steel. You can also set different instances of a subassembly to display differing LOD 
representations.
Using LOD Naming Conventions
Th ere is an inﬁ nite number of naming conventions for LODs, including the one suggested here 
(High, Moderate, and Low). Making LODs that have certain parts of the design turned on can be 
useful as well—for example, Frame Only, Frame & Transmission, Transmission Only, Conveyors 
Oﬀ , No Robots, and so on. If you give them descriptive names, other users can select the appropri-
ate LOD for the work they need to complete.
Simplifying Parts
It’s often suggested that things be made as simple as possible but not simpler. This is a good con-
cept to keep in mind when creating models in Inventor. Adding extraneous details to common 
parts can have a negative impact on large assembly performance. Of course, if the part fi le is to 
be used for fabrication, then a certain level of detail is required. Oftentimes, though, we create 
models of common parts to be used in an assembly for the end goal of getting an accurate bill 
of materials. Assembly performance could most likely be improved by reducing the amount of 
detail in those types of parts.
Removing or Suppressing Unneeded Features
Reducing the number of edges and faces in a part is a sure way to minimize the size of the part 
fi le. Removing fi llets and chamfers for purchased parts is a good way to eliminate extra faces. 
If you have common parts that are used in large numbers throughout your assemblies, you 
might consider creating two versions of these parts: one version for use in large assemblies and 
another for use in creating production drawings and Inventor Studio renderings. In Figure 9.22, 
you can see two versions of the same part. The fi le for the part on the left is approximately 
600 KB, whereas the one on the right is less than 175 KB.

SIMPLIFYING PARTS | 497
Figure 9.22
A simpliﬁ ed part
In the following steps, you will derive a simplifi ed version of a part and set the part numbers 
to match so the two fi les report the same in the BOM and parts lists. To create a simplifi ed part, 
follow these steps:
 
1. From the Get Started tab, choose Open.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_9a_010.ipt from the Chapter 09 directory of the Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Click the end-of-part (EOP) marker in the Model browser and drag it to just below the 
feature named Revolution1 (or right-click Revolution1 and choose Move EOP Marker).
 
4. Change the appearance to Default (at the top of the screen in the Quick Access toolbar, 
click the Appearance drop-down arrow and scroll for Default).
 
5. Do not save the part.
Figure 9.23 shows the end-of-part marker being placed above the existing features.

6. From the Get Started tab, choose New.
 
7. Choose the Standard.ipt template to create the new fi le and click the OK button.
 
8. In the new part, right-click and choose Finish Sketch if required. This might not be 
needed if you have your Application Options setting set up so that a new sketch is not 
created automatically when a new part is created. 
 
9. On the Manage tab, click the Derive button on the Insert panel.

498 | CHAPTER 9 LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES
 
10. In the resulting Open dialog box, browse for the fi le mi_9a_010.ipt located in the 
Chapter 09 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open 
button.
 
11. In the resulting Derived Part dialog box, choose the Derive Style option called Single 
Solid Body Merging Out Seams Between Planar Faces as the derive style.
 
12. Click the OK button to create the derived body.
 
13. In the Model browser, right-click the part name mi_9a_010.ipt and choose Suppress 
Link With Base Component. This ensures that the derived part will remain in the simpli-
fi ed state when you set the original part back to its fully detailed state.
 
14. Click the fi lename at the top of the Model browser and choose iProperties.
 
15. Choose the Project tab of the iProperties dialog box and enter mi_9a_010 as the part 
number. This ensures that as you use the simplifi ed part in an assembly, it will have the 
same part number as the original part and report an accurate BOM.
 
16. Save the fi le as mi_9a_010_simple.ipt.
 
17. Return to the original part (mi_9a_010.ipt).
 
18. Either close the fi le and click No when asked to save changes, or drag the EOP marker 
back to the bottom of the Model browser, reset the part color, and then save the fi le.
As a result you will have two fi les representing the same part. Both will be listed as the same 
component in the BOM, but the derived component will add far less overhead when used over 
and over in an assembly. Note that if the original part were to require a revision to the over-
all length, you would want to edit the simplifi ed part fi le and unsuppress the link so that the 
changes are carried through. You can place both fi les in an assembly fi le to test this workfl ow if 
you’d like, or you can close these fi les.

Chapter 10
Weldment Design
For this chapter, you must have a good understanding of parts, assemblies, and drawings. You 
will explore the various aspects of weldment design. Starting from weldment workfl ows and 
design methodologies, you’ll look at preparations, weld beads, machining features, and weld 
symbols, as well as how to document the weldment design. You will also learn some tips and 
tricks along the way.
Weldments are available in the assembly environment as a subtype of the assembly docu-
ment. Most of the topics in this chapter involve working with assembly fi les. Therefore, this 
chapter is not applicable if you have only the Autodesk® Inventor LT™ program installed.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Select and use the right weldment design methodology
 
◆
Create and edit weld preparations and machining features
 
◆
Create and edit different kinds of weld beads, such as cosmetic, fi llet, and groove
 
◆
Document weldment stages in drawings
 
◆
Generate and maintain a consistent BOM across welded assemblies, drawings, 
and presentations
Exploring Weldment Design Methodologies
One of the basic questions in weldment design is what design methodology should be used to 
create weldments. Unfortunately, there is no “one-size-fi ts-all” strategy. The design methodol-
ogy you use depends on your individual needs and requirements. You will start by defi ning the 
different design methodologies:
As-assembled  A view of the assembly with no weld preparations, beads, or machining 
features.
As-welded  A view of the assembly with weld preparations and weld beads but no 
machining features.
As-machined  A view of the fi nal welded assembly with the machining features created 
after the welding had been done. This view includes features that might penetrate or cut 
through weld beads.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

502 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
All these represent the various stages in weldment design. Once the weldment design is 
done, it helps to document the various stages of weldment design in the drawing.
Depending on the need for documentation, interference analysis, mass properties, and other 
design criteria, you can group the weldment design methodologies into the following four broad 
categories, which are defi ned in more detail in this section:
 
◆
Part fi les and part features
 
◆
Weldment assembly and derived technology
 
◆
Weldment assembly
 
◆
Multi-body part fi les
Part Files and Part Features
You can create a weldment design using part features in part fi les. With this approach, you 
use the rich modeling features of the part (sweeps, chamfers, fi llets, and lofts) to create a wide 
variety of weld bead shapes. However, this will be one big mess of a design that has no logi-
cal partitions. The main diffi culty is creating drawings with different stages—for example, 
as-assembled, as-welded, and so on—from a single design. You will not be able to see certain 
edges separating weld beads and components in drawings because they will not even exist (they 
will be merged out) in the part design. In addition, the bill of materials (BOM) will not list all 
the individual components needed to assemble the welded structures. Still, this might be an 
acceptable strategy for small weldment designs that have minor design changes over a period 
of time. Besides, the assumption is that the designer does not need to create the different stages 
in design documentation from a single weldment assembly. You could place the part weldment 
into an assembly and then create presentations and drawings of that assembly. (However, in 
drawings, you will not be able to create the different stages of weldment design.) Figure 10.1 
shows this methodology.

EXPLORING WELDMENT DESIGN METHODOLOGIES | 503
Weldment Assembly and Derived Technology
With this approach, you can derive the weldment assembly (.iam) into a single-part fi le (.ipt) 
and model the welds in the derived assembly fi le using part features. Optionally, you can derive 
the part fi le into another part fi le to show machining on welded assemblies. Disadvantages 
similar to the ones mentioned in the fi rst method exist; however, you can modify assembly con-
straints to create variants of weldment assemblies with this approach. The preparations, welds, 
and machining features will all exist in the derived component fi les. This might be a good strat-
egy for weldments where a BOM listing is required and there is no need to document different 
stages of weldment design from a single weldment assembly. Figure 10.2 shows the document 
layout of this methodology.

With this approach, you use a mixture of cosmetic, fi llet, and groove welds with preparations, 
machining features, and weld symbols at the assembly level. The main advantage is that the 
weldment can be documented as-assembled, as-welded, and so on. The BOM outlines the dif-
ferent part components. It does not preclude fi nite element analysis (FEA), since the weldment 
assembly can be derived into a part. You might fi nd this approach diffi cult initially, but you can 
see large gains in productivity later while documenting the weldment. This is the recommended 
approach for large weldments that need mass properties, interference analysis, and complete 
documentation. (Examples are structural frames, piping, industrial gates, fences, and steel fur-
niture.) You can use a combined approach of all four methods if that’s what works best for your 
needs. However, when new enhancements are made to weldments, this approach lends itself to

easily leveraging the new functionality. Figure 10.3 shows the document layout of this design 
methodology. (The fi gure doesn’t show the various subassemblies that the weldment assembly 
might contain by breaking it into logical pieces.) Good planning helps in generating a well-built 
design that can be understood and easily maintained by designers. All in all, you should use 
this design methodology if you cannot decide on one of the other three methods.

Multi-body Part Files
Since a completed weldment exists in a larger assembly as a single component, an interesting 
way of defi ning the weldment can be by using multi-body parts. To use this approach, you cre-
ate separate bodies within the single part fi le by using the New Solid option in the Extrude, 
Revolve, and other sketched feature dialogs. This creates a virtual assembly made up of multiple 
features in a single fi le. Once the component is defi ned, it can be divided into an assembly using 
the Make Components tool as described in Chapter 5, “Advanced Modeling Techniques.” From 
that point on, you can treat your weldment assembly as though you created it from separate part 
fi les from the beginning, with one notable exception: You can then update the assembly and the 
weldment by editing the multi-body part you created initially. Figure 10.4 shows the layout of 
the multi-body method.
You can create a weldment assembly in two ways. For the fi rst method, you create a new 
weldment assembly by selecting any of the weldment templates provided by the Autodesk® 
Inventor® software. To do this, just select the Get Started tab, click the New button, and then 
select an assembly template designated as a weldment template. Or you can convert an exist-
ing assembly document into a weldment assembly by selecting the Assemble tab and clicking 
Convert To Weldment.
Once you convert an assembly into a weldment, it is not possible to convert it into a regular 
assembly. Also note that in a weldment document, you cannot create new positional representa-
tions or use fl exible assembly functionality because a weldment is meant to be an assembly of 
parts fi xed in place. Once you’ve created a weldment assembly, you can go to the next logical 
step of modeling preparations.

Communication Is the Key to Dealing with Weldments
Depending on your needs, weldments can be as simple as a single part or as complex as assembly 
weldments with preparations, welds, and machining. Talk to the group that is going to be manufac-
turing your parts (whether the job is farmed out or in-house) and ﬁ nd out what level of detail the 
group requires when making the parts to your prints. Often, you will ﬁ nd that what is important to 
the designer is not as important to the welder (and vice versa). By speaking with these groups, you’ll 
get a better understanding of what path you should take for your weldment models and drawings.
Modeling Preparations
Imagine that you’ve created the weldment assembly for a boxed container and want to add weld 
beads. Before adding the weld beads, the assembly needs weld preparations to create space for 
the weld bead to be placed. You can model a variety of preparation features to mill or remove 
material. Note that preparations are assembly features only, meaning that these features exist 
only in the assembly and not at the part level. Here are the most common preparation features:
 
◆
Extrude
 
◆
Revolve
 
◆
Hole
 
◆
Sweep
 
◆
Chamfer
 
◆
Move Face

506 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
Figure 10.5 shows the preparation environment and the relevant tools. To create the fea-
tures in the previous list, you use the same set of steps that you used in part (Chapter 4, “Basic 
Modeling Techniques”) or assembly modeling (Chapter 8, “Assembly Design Workfl ows”). The 
Move Face functionality is primarily intended for weld preparation in the assembly environ-
ment and is available in both the part and assembly environments.
Figure 10.5

Groove welds are classifi ed by the different kinds of weld preparations. Figure 10.6 shows 
some commonly used weld preparations. In the left column, from top to bottom, you can see the 
Square Groove, Bevel Groove, and U-Groove types. In the right column, from top to bottom, you 
can see the Double Bevel Groove, V-Groove, and Double-U Groove types. Observe that these 
preparations might be referred to by slightly different names in the welding industry. Although 
most groove welds require nothing more than a simple chamfer, in most cases groove welds 
require some sort of material-removal preparation.

The alternative to weld preparation is to build the shape of the preparation using the sketch 
and then a swept volume (Extrude, Revolve, and Sweep) cut using that sketch to create the 
feature shape in the part fi le. However, it is recommended that you use the weld preparation 
feature, which helps show the manufacturing process. In addition, it aids in documenting the 

EXPLORING COSMETIC WELDS | 507
weldment in a drawing with just the components and preparations. Another advantage is that 
the designer, weld fabricator, or manufacturing instruction–generating program can easily fi nd 
these features in one place—in other words, in the Preparations folder. This might be useful 
for generating the desired manufacturing information.
To create a preparation feature, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_10a_045.iam from the Chapter 10 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder. 
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 10 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/
masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the book’s 
introduction for the download and setup instructions.
 
3. You have three choices for this step: double-click the Preparations folder in the Model 
browser to activate the weld bead features, right-click the Preparations folder and select 
Edit, or click the Preparation button on the Process panel of the Weld tab.
 
4. Click the Chamfer button on the Preparation And Machining panel and select the bottom 
edge of the yellow face.
 
5. Set the chamfer size to 7 mm and click OK.
 
6. Exit the preparation environment either by clicking the Return button or by right-clicking 
and choosing Finish Edit.
You can double-click the Preparations folder and edit the individual preparation features as 
needed. Think of the Preparations folder as a separate environment with its own set of tools. 
The End Of Features (EOF) node in the browser works differently than the End Of Part (EOP) 
node in the part modeling browser. In the part modeling browser, when the EOP node is moved 
around, it sticks at that location even after an update. In the preparation environment, the EOF 
node can be moved to above or below any feature location in the Preparations folder, just as in 
part modeling.
However, when you leave the preparation environment—either by double-clicking the top-
level assembly node in the weldment assembly or by right-clicking and selecting Finish Edit in 
the graphics window—the EOF node is rolled all the way to the end in the Preparations folder. 
It might be thought of as a browser node that does not stick in its dragged browser location, 
unlike parts. The EOF node has similar behavior whether you are in the preparation, welds, or 
machining environment.
Once you’ve placed the weld preparations, you are ready to place welds. Keep in mind that 
you do not have to create preparations. Also, you can return to the preparation environment 
even after having placed welds.
Exploring Cosmetic Welds
To create or edit a weld feature, click the Welds button on the Process panel, or right-click 
the Welds folder in the Model browser and select Edit. You can also double-click the Welds 
folder and edit the individual features. Figure 10.7 shows the available features in the welds 
environment.

The Cosmetic Weld feature is available by clicking the Cosmetic button in the Weld panel. 
Figure 10.8 shows the Cosmetic Weld dialog box. When using the Cosmetic Weld feature, you 
simply select edges of the model. These edges can belong to part components or other weld 
beads.

EXPLORING COSMETIC WELDS | 509
Cosmetic welds are recommended for use when you have the following conditions:
 
◆
A need for lightweight representation.
 
◆
No requirement for interference analysis.
 
◆
No need for the estimated total mass of the assembly with solid weld beads. However, you 
could optionally have the cosmetic weld participate in mass property calculations.
Note that the bead (which you defi ne in the upper portion of the weld dialog boxes) and the 
weld symbol (defi ned in the lower portion of the weld dialog boxes) are decoupled; in other 
words, optionally you can create a weld symbol. This applies to all types of weld beads. In addi-
tion, you can use a single weld symbol to denote multiple welds involving cosmetic, fi llet, and 
groove welds. Cosmetic welds can represent a wide variety of welds. You can create them using 
edges (the Edge option), tangent continuous sets of edges (the Chain option), or loops (the Loop 
option).
Selecting the option of applying a weld symbol will place a symbol on the screen without 
being prompted for its placement. You can move the symbol after the weld has been added.
Create a Simple Cosmetic Weld
In this exercise you’ll create a basic cosmetic weld and a weld symbol by selecting model’s edges 
and entering the specifi cation of the desired weld:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_10a_001.iam located in the Chapter 10 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. You have three options for this step:
 
◆
Double-click the Welds folder in the Model browser to activate the weld bead features.
 
◆
Right-click the Welds folder and select Edit.
 
◆
Click the Welds button in the Process panel of the Weld tab.
 
4. Once the weld environment is set active by using one of the three methods listed, click 
the Cosmetic button on the Weld panel.
 
5. In the Cosmetic Weld dialog box, select the Create Welding Symbol check box (if it is not 
already selected).
 
6. Select the Chain option and select the edges as shown in Figure 10.9. The Chain option 
is similar to the Automatic Edge Chain option in the Fillet dialog box in part modeling. 
It collects all the tangent continuous edges in a loop on a single face. Note that you may 
need to use the Select Other tool to toggle through the available loops.
 
7. Enter 6 mm for both legs in the weld symbol, as shown in Figure 10.8.
 
8. In the Area input box, enter 18 mm ^2 for the bead cross section based on the leg lengths.
The bead cross section can be calculated using the following equation:
Bead cross section = (1/2 × Leg Length 1 × Length 2)

The bead cross section area value is critical in determining the mass of cosmetic welds. Later, 
in the section “Understanding Bead Property Report and Mass Properties,” you’ll see how to 
use this for mass-properties calculations. For now, though, you can close this fi le without saving 
changes and continue on to explore more options for the cosmetic weld.
Using Split Faces to Place Cosmetic Welds
In certain cases when there is no edge to click as input, you can split the faces of the compo-
nents in the part fi le (.ipt) at the location where it is welded and use the split edges as input 
to the cosmetic weld feature. On the left of Figure 10.10, for example, there are no explicit 
edges to click at the intersection of the planar face on the hollow tube and the cylindrical face 
on the cylinder. Therefore, you could edit the cylindrical part and create a work plane that 
is offset from the end of the cylinder and then use the Split tool to split the cylindrical face 
of the cylindrical part with the work plane so that you can use those split edges to create the 
cosmetic weld feature. The center of Figure 10.10 shows the split edge. Work points cannot be 
clicked as part of the cosmetic weld feature. The edges need to have fi nite length in order to be 
clickable for the cosmetic weld feature.

Creating Weld Beads
A weld bead feature is a parametric, solid representation of the real-world weld bead. It can be 
generated from input faces of a single component or from input faces of multiple components, 
including the faces of existing weld beads in the weldment assembly. You can also create a weld 
on a single part that is placed in a weldment assembly. Here are some examples:
Example 1  Place a single sheet-metal part in a weldment assembly and create fi llet welds at 
fl ange corners to create a container.
Example 2  Create a fi llet or groove weld between two plates (two parts or one part that has 
two extrusion features for the plates).
Example 3  Create a fi llet or groove weld between two plates and another weld bead.
Weld beads automatically contribute to mass property calculations and can take part in inter-
ference analyses. All weld bead features create an independent body that does not take part in 

512 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
Boolean operations with the assembly components. Other machining features can cut into weld 
beads. There are two major weld features to create physical 3D welds:
Fillet Weld Feature  A fi llet weld builds up corners by adding weld material between faces. 
Fillet welds are the most commonly used type of weld in industrial machinery. You should 
use this feature when there is no gap between the components. A specialized kind of fi llet 
weld with a gap is supported.
Groove Weld Feature  A groove weld feature predominantly fi lls gaps between compo-
nents. However, you can also use it when the components are touching each other. There are 
many opportunities to combine fi llet and groove welds to generate the desired weld beads.
Weld Calculators
Th e weldment environment also has several weld calculators (only if the design accelerator add-in 
is loaded). Weld calculators assist you in the design of weld joints. You can check typical welds with 
diﬀ erent types of loading. You can use these calculators to check static weld loading and to check 
butt and ﬁ llet weld joints for both static and fatigue loading.
Creating Fillet Welds
The basic idea behind a fi llet weld is that you are joining two sets of faces. You can control the 
weld bead defi nition parametrically by using the parameters shown in Figure 10.12. This is 
known as leg-length measurement. You can enter the two leg lengths used to generate the bead and 

CREATING FILLET WELDS | 513
also specify the throat measurement. Throat measurement is the distance from the root of the 
fi llet weld to the center of its face. You just enter the throat length, and Inventor calculates the rest 
of the size of the weld bead. The offset value has relevance only when you declare the weld to be 
concave or convex. Figure 10.12 shows the two leg lengths and the two types of measurement.

The top shape of a fi llet weld can be fl at, convex, or concave, as shown in Figure 10.13 (from 
left to right). For fl at, the offset is 0.0. For concave or convex based on the offset, Inventor calcu-
lates the necessary bump or depression shape.

concave shapes

Modeling a Fillet Weld
Fillet welds are likely the most common weld type you will use in your weldment designs. 
To create a simple fi llet weld, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_10a_003.iam from the Chapter 10 directory of your Mastering

This exercise has illustrated a basic fi llet weld and some of the extents options available. You 
can close this fi le without saving changes and continue reading about other options for placing 
fi llet welds.
Fillet Welds and Gaps
You can place a fi llet weld between two parts even if they do not contact, using the fi llet weld 
to bridge the gap. If the goal is to fi ll the gap, you would likely use a groove weld. Figure 10.16 
shows a hole gap through which a cylinder is passing. You can use a fi llet weld to bridge the 
gap, but it will not fi ll the gap. The fi llet weld will work even if the two components are sepa-
rated by a gap at some places and touch at other places.
Figure 10.16
Shaft through 
plate
To create these fi llet welds, you still click the two faces, as shown in Figure 10.16. Inventor 
infers the gap and generates the fi llet weld bead. To fi ll the gap between the two mating faces of 
components, you should use groove welds.
Figure 10.17 shows another variant of two components that are separated by a gap. Here, 
the solution is dependent on the size of the weld and the amount of face available. On the left, 
a 10 mm weld comes up short on the corners. On the right, an 18 mm weld runs past the fl at 
edges of the tube and therefore will not build as selected. The weld adjusts to fi t as required. If 
the weld size is too small to bridge the gap at all or is too large for the selected face, the weld 
will not be built.

hollow tube

Don’t Forget to Speak with Those Manufacturing the Parts
Inventor provides just about every possible option that you could want as a designer with regard to 
weld sizes, shapes, and contours. However, you should always speak with those who will be manu-
facturing the parts to determine whether what you have designed can be built eﬃ  ciently. It would 
be unfortunate to spend a lot of time with speciﬁ c contours, sizes, and ﬁ nishes if the weld shop 
is just going to give you a standard ﬁ llet weld regardless of the details you call out. You’ll need to 
decide whether it’s time to ﬁ nd a new welder or whether you are putting too much information into 
the part. More than one designer has found this out the hard way when that $10 bracket suddenly 
ends up costing $100 because of the demanding weld callouts placed on the print.
Creating Intermittent Fillet Welds
Intermittent fi llet welds essentially produce patterns of the weld bead along a set of edges. 
Figure 10.19 shows an example of an intermittent fi llet weld using the Start-Length extents 
 solution to adjust the orientation to avoid interference with the existing holes.
There are three ways that intermittent welds can be specifi ed, depending on which standard 
you are using. To change the standard, select the Tools tab and click the Document Settings 
button. From there you will see the Default Standard setting on the Standard tab. Here is a list 
describing the differences, as shown in Figure 10.20:
ANSI Standard  Specify bead length and the distance between bead centers.
ISO, BSI, DIN, and GB Standards  Specify the bead length, the spacing between beads, and 
the number of beads.
JIS Standard  Specify the bead length, the distance between bead centers, and the number 
of beads.

The Extents control allows you to select the beginning and ending planar faces or planes 
between which the weld bead will be created. The steps to produce a From-To fi llet weld bead 
are similar to the steps outlined for extents and cosmetic welds earlier in this chapter. When 
you’re welding a long piece of metal, often intermittent welds are cost effective and reduce 
warping in the part.
Creating Groove Welds
A groove weld is primarily used to fi ll gaps between two sets of faces. Once such gaps are fi lled, 
you might top the groove weld with a fi llet weld. Figure 10.21 shows some examples.
Figure 10.21
Groove weld 
examples

518 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
Like a fi llet weld, a groove weld needs two sets of facesets. The Full Face Weld option, when 
selected, tells Inventor to use the full face to generate the weld. When this option is not selected, 
only a portion of the face will be used to generate the weld. Inventor calculates the specifi c por-
tion of the face by projecting the smaller faceset to the larger faceset (if the two facesets are the 
same size, Inventor picks one of them to project). Figure 10.22 shows the resulting weld beads 
with Full Face Weld off (left) and on (right).
Figure 10.22
Full Face Weld 
option
The Ignore Internal Loops option controls whether to ignore or consider the internal loop to 
generate the weld bead. When selected, it results in a “solid” weld bead (Figure 10.23, left); when 
it’s not selected, the result is a “hollow” grove weld (Figure 10.23, right).
Figure 10.23
Ignore Internal 
Loops option
The fi ll direction is used to project one set of faces to another to generate the groove weld 
bead. In Figure 10.24, you can see the difference between the resulting weld bead shapes.
Figure 10.24
Fill direction

CREATING GROOVE WELDS | 519
Be aware that the Fill Direction option is not available when you use the Full Face Weld 
option for both faceset 1 and faceset 2 or when using the Radial Fill option. When you are using 
the Fill Direction option, you might observe that Inventor can create welds that are not manufac-
turable, depending on the direction you choose.
You can select the following for the fi ll direction:
 
◆
Planar faces and work planes (specifi es the direction normal to chosen face/plane)
 
◆
Cylindrical, conical, or toroidal faces (specifi es the direction of the surface’s axis)
 
◆
Work axes
 
◆
Linear part edges
One question that comes up frequently is, what direction should be selected for the fi ll? One 
guideline you can use is to imagine the average geometric center of faceset 1 and the average 
geometric center of faceset 2. The line connecting the two geometric centers will be the fi ll direc-
tion to generate the groove weld bead. You are not required to calculate the geometric centers of 
the facesets. It is advisable to try different fi ll directions to get the desired weld bead shape.
You can use the Radial Fill option to project the weld bead around a curve. When you’re 
using the Radial Fill option, the Fill Direction option is not available. Figure 10.25 shows a 
radial-fi lled groove weld.

7. Select the Full Face Weld option for faceset 1 to extend the weld to cover the entire yellow 
face. Note that selecting Full Face Weld for faceset 2 does not change the weld since the 
weld bead already covers the entire face.
 
8. Click OK; your result should resemble Figure 10.26.

As a general rule, if the preview comes up, it is almost certain that the bead will succeed.
Performing Machining Operations
Once you’ve created the preparations and welds, you can create machine features. The features 
available for machining are similar to the features in the preparation environment. In terms of 
operations, they are performed after the generation of weld beads. One of the main advantages 
of providing the machining operations in a separate environment is that in drawings you can 
document them in the as-machined state. Holes and extrude cuts are typical post-weld machin-
ing features.
Figure 10.27 shows a welded assembly with machining operations performed on it.

Holes that are important to the location of welds should be placed into the parts that are 
being welded together. Because the machined view of the weldment is a subset of the welded 
view, you cannot refer to “machined” holes when detailing an as-welded model.

◆
Extrude

Exploring Weld Properties and Combinations
The following sections cover the additional aspects of weldments: setting weld properties, rep-
licating welds, combining fi llet and groove weld beads to produce the desired weld bead shape, 
and using the split technique.
Weld Properties
To turn off the visibility of all weld beads in an open assembly, select the View tab and select 
Object Visibility ➢ Welds. You can also expand the Welds folder in the Model browser, right-
click the Beads folder, and then deselect Visibility to turn off the weld beads of a particular 
assembly or subassembly. You can suppress individual weld bead features in the Model 
browser; the suppress feature is similar to part feature suppression.
You can choose the weld material during the initial conversion of an assembly to a weldment 
or change it after the fact. Welded Aluminium-6061 is the default material in the Weld Bead

In existing weldments, you can change the weld color styles using the weld properties. In 
the Model browser, right-click the Welds node, select iProperties, select the Weld Bead tab, and 
choose the weld bead color style or the end fi ll color style. You can use the weld bead color style 
to assign different color styles to the weld bead. Similarly, the end caps (faces) that you selected 
in the weldment assembly can be assigned an end fi ll color style.
Replication
Welds (cosmetic, fi llet, and groove beads) can be copied or mirrored in assemblies through the 
Copy Components and Mirror Components tools. Both sets of components that support the 
weld need to be copied or mirrored for the welds to be copied or mirrored. For example, if a 
cosmetic weld exists only on component Plate1, and if Plate1 is copied or mirrored, the cosmetic 
weld is also copied or mirrored. You cannot copy or mirror the weld without its components 
being copied or mirrored. Weld beads can be derived from the assembly into another part docu-
ment using the Derived Component tool in parts.
Groove and Fillet Weld Combinations
Most welds can be generated using a combination of groove and fi llet welds. Figure 10.29 shows 
an example of welding two hollow tubes with a groove weld. The horizontal tube is welded 
with a vertical tube. Faceset 1 comprises the two fi llet faces on the horizontal member, and 
Faceset 2 consists of the single mating face on the bottom of the vertical member. The fi ll direc-
tion is established by selecting a vertical edge or a horizontal face.
In Figure 10.30, a fi llet weld is applied. Faceset 1 is composed of three faces, the top hori-
zontal face and the two corresponding fi llet faces, as indicated by the light arrows. Faceset 2 is 
composed of the three corresponding component faces on the vertical tube, as shown by the 
dark arrows in Figure 10.30. A second fi llet weld would then be generated in the same way on 
the other side.

Split Technique
Since welds work on input faces (the two facesets that you select to do the weld), it is sometimes 
required and at other times desirable to split the input faces in order to have the weld bead only 
on a certain portion of the face or to have better control of the resulting weld. Essentially, you 
are helping Inventor use the partial face that is generated from the split.
In certain situations, using fi llet welds that involve multiple possibilities might make it dif-
fi cult to control the placement of welds. One instance of this is when controlling the offset of 
welds around a cylindrical face. Figure 10.31 shows the difference between using a cylinder 
with a split face and one without. If the cylindrical face is split, you can place the weld in two 
parts and control the start and end offsets so that holes are given proper clearance. If the face 
is not split, Inventor automatically breaks the weld where it encounters the holes, but you can 
adjust the offsets for the fi rst hole only.

In the following steps you will use the Split tool to control the start and stop positions of the 
weld bead:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_10a_006.iam from the Chapter 10 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder.
Take a look at the existing fi llet weld around the blue cylinder. Notice that the offset on 
the one hole is not adequate. You will create a similar weld on the yellow cylinder but use 
the Split tool to ensure that you have full control of the offsets.
 
3. Locate the part called mi_10a_014 in the Model browser and double-click it to set it active 
for edits (or right-click and choose Edit).
 
4. Click the Split button under the Combine drop-down on the Modify panel of the 3D 
Model tab.
 
5. Select WorkPlane1 from the Model browser for the Split tool.
 
6. Select the cylindrical face for the Faces selection.
 
7. Click OK. Note that the cylindrical face is now split into two halves. Figure 10.32 shows 
the Split selections.

Using the Weld Symbol
You can create a weld symbol in assemblies by clicking the Welds folder and using the Weld 
Symbol tool. In drawings, you can fi nd this tool in the Annotate tab. You have to decide to create 

526 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
them in the right place (assemblies or assemblies and drawings) based on your communica-
tion with the welding department and other departments that are involved in producing the 
weldment. The weld symbol, which is optional in the assembly environment, has certain key 
characteristics:
 
◆
It cannot be created without a weld bead consuming it.
 
◆
The primary bead is the weld bead to which the welding symbol is attached.
 
◆
You’re allowed to activate the weld symbol grips and reattach the weld symbol to any other 
visible bead edge from that symbol’s group.
 
◆
Multiple weld beads (including cosmetic weld beads) can be grouped under a single weld 
symbol.
 
◆
The weld symbols are listed in a separate folder below the Weld Beads folder.
 
◆
A bead can be consumed by only one welding symbol object at any given time.
 
◆
A linked bead that is moved out of its welding symbol group causes the parent welding 
symbol to become unassociated.
 
◆
Cross-highlighting is supported for both the bead objects and the welding symbol object. 
If you select a welding symbol node in the Model browser, the welding symbol and all the 
beads consumed by that welding symbol will be cross-highlighted in the graphics win-
dow. Alternatively, if you select a bead node from either the welding symbols portion of the 
browser or the Beads folder portion of the browser, the bead will be cross-highlighted in 
the graphics window.
 
◆
A new welding symbol can be created for an already created weld feature.
 
◆
Welding symbols have visibility control.
 
◆
If a weld symbol references a weld feature, then it is consumed. Otherwise, the bead is 
unconsumed by any weld symbols. Therefore, three browser fi ltering options are avail-
able from the Beads folder context menu: Show All, Show Consumed Only, and Show 
Unconsumed Only.
Figure 10.35 shows a single weld symbol for the multiple weld beads.

UNDERSTANDING BEAD PROPERTY REPORT AND MASS PROPERTIES | 527
To add multiple weld beads to the same existing symbol, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the desired weld symbol.
 
2. Choose Edit Welding Symbol.
 
3. Add weld beads by selecting them in either the model window or the Model browser.
Only unconsumed weld beads should appear highlighted in the model window. Right-
clicking the browser or model window lets you select weld beads and quickly see which weld 
beads have been unconsumed. To disassociate a weld bead from its corresponding symbol, 
right-click the bead in the Model browser and choose the Unconsumed Bead tool from the 
 context menu.
Understanding Bead Property Report and Mass 
Properties
To estimate accurate weld rod usage, fabrication time, and bead weights, the weld property 
reporting tool is available in assemblies. This can be used to help estimate costs. This tool allows 
you to query the mass, volume, length, type, and name of individual beads in the assembly. 
Through an option (available after you select Bead Report from the Weld panel of the Weld tab), 
you can retrieve this data for the current assembly and all of its child weldment assemblies. This 
information will be exported to a standard Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 
10.36. In the weldment workfl ow, you can generate a weld bead report for the core packaging 
unit that contains the three subassemblies.
Figure 10.36
Weld bead prop-
erty reporting in 
assemblies
To calculate the total length of weld beads, you can sum up the total length using the Excel 
Sum functions. Length and area values are not reported for groove welds. The default “save to” 
location is the parent assembly’s directory, but you can change this location. Weld properties 
are, at best, estimates. Many factors can change the weight of a weld bead. If the weight of a part 
is critical, consider machining the part to meet the criteria after welding.
The cross section entered in the Cosmetic Weld dialog box is multiplied by the length of the 
cosmetic weld bead and is optionally considered in the mass properties to calculate volume. 
When the Include Cosmetic Welds option is checked in the Physical tab of the iProperties dialog 
box, this volume is included in the calculations. The mass is determined by the selected weld 
material. This option is useful where you need only lightweight representation but at the same 
time need the welds to participate in mass properties.

Be Explicit with Symbols
Although you can refer to any textbook on welding for the correct use of the symbols referred to in 
Table 10.1, keep in mind that many shops have their own “shorthand” versions of weld symbols. It 
is imperative that you communicate with the welders to make sure you agree on the symbols. Many 
weld shops do not know the “standard” yet still produce excellent parts.
A perfect example is the “all-around” symbol. Some shops take this to mean only opposite sides of 
the indicated line, whereas others interpret this symbol to mean you want all contiguous surfaces 
welded. When in doubt, you should be explicit with your symbols.

Weldment Design Stages
Now that you’ve explored the tools available in the weldment environment, you’ll explore 
how to document the four major stages of weldment design in the drawing. You can create a 
 weldment drawing in the following stages:
Assembly  As-assembled with no assembly features
Preparation  As-prepped
Welds  As-welded
Machining  As-machined
Figure 10.38 shows a weldment in the four stages during its creation. Figure 10.39 shows 
drawing views of the same weldment detailed at the various stages.

In the End Fill dialog box, the fi llet process shape has Leg1 and Leg2 as parameters. J-Type, 
V-Type, and U-Type Preset Shape have controls for the width and depth.
Drawing Weld Symbol
If your assembly has weld beads modeled and weld symbols created in the model, using the 
Get Welding Symbols option shown in Figure 10.41 is the best way to add weld symbols 
to the drawing.
If your assembly has weld beads modeled but does not have weld symbols created in the 
model, you can use the Welding symbol tool and then select a weld bead to retrieve the bead 
information automatically, based on the information found in the weldment model. However, 
you should be aware that the symbol won’t update if the weld bead is updated in the model.
Many times you may need to just create the weld symbol in the drawing without having to 
create any weld beads in the assembly. Although this may suffi ce for your needs much of the 
time, remember that you cannot perform any interference analysis or mass-properties calcula-
tions the way you can with modeled welds.
To create a welding symbol in the drawing, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Welding symbol button on the Symbols panel of the Annotate tab (you might 
need to use the fl yout menu to fi nd it).
 
2. This activates the selection. The command message string displays the text “Click On A 
Location.”
 
3. Select a weld bead (if present) or any entity or location in the graphics area to defi ne the 
location of the welding symbol.
When placing a symbol in the drawing, you can create a complex leader by selecting 
more than one point as you are placing the symbol. If you would like to add more later, 
you can do so by right-clicking the existing leader and selecting Add Vertex/Leader in 
the context menu.
 
4. Right-click within the graphics area and select Continue from the context menu. The 
Welding Symbol dialog box appears.
 
5. Specify the desired welding symbol.
 
6. The welding symbol preview dynamically updates.
 
7. Click OK, and the specifi ed welding symbol appears at the specifi ed location.
Caterpillar
You can create and use caterpillars (2D weld representations) in drawings when you want to 
use a lightweight representation for solid weld beads. As long as the welder is comfortable with 
this representation, you can use caterpillars. Figure 10.43 shows the dialog box for the Weld 
Caterpillars tool in drawings. You can create weld caterpillars using the boundary (extent) 
edges of the welds. This drawing annotation is not associated with weldments in the assembly 
model. In other words, you can create the caterpillar on any edge without the presence of any

GENERATING A BILL OF MATERIALS AND PARTS LIST | 535
Caterpillars can be useful when you want to represent a weldment using a single-part fi le 
and create a drawing from it. You can then indicate the position and detail of the welds along 
the edge. Use the Split tool, which will allow you to create edges where none may exist.
Weldment Workflows
You are a designer working for a company in the packaging industry. Th e entire packaging system 
consists of several functional units that form its structure. You are interested in the high-level core 
packaging unit that consists of three subassemblies: A, B, and C. Let’s say it contains parts consist-
ing of a boxed container (A), a lift-arm mechanism (B) for the boxed container, and railings (C) on 
which the container moves from one station to another. Each subassembly comprises structural 
steel shapes and/or tubes that are bent and plates that are welded together.
You want to analyze subassembly A, which forms the container in the context of the top-level 
assembly, to check for interferences. For this, you need accurate solid weld beads to analyze the 
interference. You want to pattern these solid weld beads and their components and create a draw-
ing of this subassembly. To accomplish this, you would place modeled ﬁ llet and groove weld beads.
On subassembly B, which forms the lift-arm mechanism, the weld beads are not very complex, so 
you don’t require a modeled weld for each bead, but you do need mass analysis of welds. In this 
case, you’ll place lightweight, cosmetic welds and document them in the drawing.
On weld subassembly C, which forms the railings on which the container moves, you are interested 
neither in interference analysis nor in mass properties in assemblies. For C, you are interested only 
in quickly documenting the weldments in drawings. You need a streamlined interface to document 
the welds in drawings, and you want to generate any weld bead or symbol regardless of the weld 
standard. To do this, you will use just the Weld Symbol tool in the drawing environment.
By using the various weld tools in conjunction with one another, you can design and document 
weldments in a way that makes sense to the task at hand. You can take advantage of the ﬂ exibility 
that comes with using any of these tools together to make weldment design accommodate your 
speciﬁ c needs even though they fulﬁ ll diﬀ erent design and documentation requirements.
Generating a Bill of Materials and Parts List
Once a weldment design is done, you typically need to generate a bill of materials (BOM) and a 
parts list. Also, you’ll want to customize the BOM to represent a weldment.
You can automatically generate and maintain a consistent bill of materials across welded 
assemblies, drawings, and presentations. Components that are deemed “inseparable” are assem-
blies that cannot be taken apart without doing damage to one or more of their components, 
typically weldments. Manufacturing processes treat inseparable assemblies like purchased 
components, and they are represented as a single line item.

536 | CHAPTER 10 WELDMENT DESIGN
When documented in its own context, an inseparable assembly is treated as a standard one 
in that all of the parts are listed. Figure 10.45 shows the BOM for an assembly that consists of a 
weldment assembly and single-piece part. On the left, the weldment is shown in a structured 
BOM view, listing the weldment and the parts within. On the right, the BOM is shown as Parts 
Only; note that the weldments are listed as a single component.
Figure 10.45
Inseparable compo-
nents as handled by 
the BOM
To modify the BOM structure, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the weldment assembly.
 
2. Click the Bill Of Materials button on the Manage panel of the Manage tab.
 
3. On the Model Data tab, double-click in the BOM Structure column, select the drop-down 
for each component, and select Inseparable.
 
4. Click Done in the Bill Of Materials dialog box.
You can change the BOM structure of several components at once by right-clicking the BOM 
Structure cell of a component marked as inseparable, right-clicking and choosing Copy, Shift-
clicking multiple components, and then right-clicking and choosing Paste.
Th e Bottom Line
Select and use the right weldment design methodology.  You’ve been shown three weld-
ment design methodologies. Before you start on any weldment design, it is imperative to 
keep the documentation, interference analysis, mass properties, and other design criteria in 
perspective and select the right design methodology.
Master It  How do you choose the right weldment strategy for you?
Create and edit weld preparations and machining features.  Following the weldment 
methodology, you need to plan on creating the gaps needed (weld preparations) to deposit 
the weld beads. You need to create post-weldment machining features that go through the 
weld beads.
Master It  Weld preparations and machining features are similar to part modeling 
features. Based on the weld-bead shape needed, you should plan on creating the prepa-
rations in advance. Once the welds are done, you must create the features for the machin-
ing processes. Where can you fi nd preparation and machining features, and when do you 
use them?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 537
Create and edit different kinds of weld beads, such as cosmetic, fi llet, and groove.  
Weldment design involves the optimal mix of cosmetic and solid weld beads based on the 
requirements of your design goals and model verifi cation needs.
Master It  You should create the weld annotations only in drawings, without any need 
to create them in the model. You have weld subassemblies that need only lightweight rep-
resentation in both the model and drawings. In situations involving accurate interference 
and mass properties, you require accurate weld beads. The question is, what type of weld 
beads should you use?
Document weldment stages in drawings.  Welds need to be documented in assemblies or 
drawings. It is important to show the different stages of weldment design in drawings to get 
a good idea of how to manufacture the weldment. You can use the drawing tools effectively 
to annotate the welds in drawings. This will help the welder understand the design intent 
better.
Master It  Several tools are used for weld documentation. You can annotate the welds 
in assemblies. If you prefer to document the welds in drawings, you could document 
the four stages of weldment design: the as-assembled, as-prepped, as-welded, and 
as-machined stages in drawings. Name two other drawing tools that customize weld 
documentation.
Generate and maintain a consistent BOM across welded assemblies, drawings, and 
presentations.  You have been shown how to generate and maintain a consistent bill of 
materials for weldment assemblies and a parts list in drawings. Mark parts or assemblies as 
inseparable to designate them as weldments.
Master It  How do you generate the BOM and parts list for your weldment ?


Chapter 11
Presentations and Exploded Views
It is often useful to show an assembly of parts in a disassembled or exploded view for use in 
assembly instructions, repair manuals, and replacement part diagrams for catalogs. Inventor 
has a specifi c environment and fi le type that allows you to create these views in 3D using the 
assembly fi les you’ve already created. You can even animate the assembly (or disassembly) of 
your designs and create video fi les or animated DWF fi les. Be aware that in order to access the 
presentation tools, you must be using a full version of the Autodesk® Inventor® program. The 
Autodesk® Inventor LT™ software does not include the presentation tools.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Create an exploded assembly view by creating a presentation
 
◆

◆
Create rotational tweaks
 
◆
Group, reorder, and animate tweaks
 
◆
Publish presentation fi les
Working in the Presentation Environment
Presentations are generally used to document how an assembly model is put together or taken 
apart. Your end result could be as simple as a static explosion that you’ll use to generate a 2D 
view in a drawing, or it could be a dynamic video where a design is assembled or disassembled 
through animation.
To access the presentation tools, you will use a new fi le template with the fi le extension .ipn. 
These are referred to as presentation fi les in Inventor. When you fi rst create a new presentation 
fi le, you’ll fi nd that the environment looks similar to the other part and assembly modeling 
environments, but it has a signifi cantly reduced set of tools. The 3D navigation tools detailed 
earlier in this book (Orbit and ViewCube® tools), as well as the browser, are used in presenta-
tions as well as in the 3D modeling environments. In the following pages, you will create a basic 
exploded assembly and explore how to create tweaks, animations, and assembly instructions.
Creating a Basic Explosion
In the following sections, you’ll take a look at the basics of creating a presentation from an 
assembly fi le. This includes accessing an IPN template fi le, creating an IPN view (explosion), 
and creating linear tweaks. You’ll start by creating a presentation fi le from a template and then 
choose an assembly to explode.

If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 11 fi les from www.sybex.com/go
/masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction 
for the download and setup instructions.
Accessing an IPN Template
You create presentation fi les by using an IPN (.ipn) template and then referencing an existing 
assembly fi le (.iam). To create this presentation, start with the Standard (mm).ipn template:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the New button.
 
2. In the Create New File dialog box, select the Metric folder and choose the Standard (mm) 
.ipn template.
 
3. Click the OK button.
Figure 11.1 shows the Create New File dialog box and the IPN template.

The fi rst step in creating an assembly explosion is referencing an assembly fi le. A presentation 
fi le can reference only one assembly fi le at a time, but the assembly can be used to generate 
as many explosions as you might need to properly document your design. For example, you

may create one explosion to be used as a 2D drawing view and another explosion to be used 
as an animation. You may also choose to explode each subassembly in its own explosion. Walk 
through the following steps to create an assembly explosion:
 
1. On the Presentation tab, click the Create View button.
 
2. In the Select Assembly dialog box, shown in Figure 11.2, browse for mi_11a_001.iam 
located in the Chapter 11 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click 
the OK button.
Figure 11.2
Th e Select Assembly 
dialog box
 
3. Click the Options button to specify which view, position, or LOD representation of the 
selected assembly you want loaded into the presentation environment.
 
4. Set the view representation to Default and leave the positional and LOD representations 
set to Master.
 
5. Click the Associative check box to ensure that the presentation view will update if the 
assembly view representation is updated.
 
6. Click the OK button when the File Open Options dialog box looks like Figure 11.3.
Figure 11.3
Th e File Open 
Options dialog box

542 | CHAPTER 11 PRESENTATIONS AND EXPLODED VIEWS
If you have a relatively small assembly and it was modeled with a full and robust set 
of assembly constraints, you may choose to create an automatic explosion in the Select 
Assembly dialog box and then make minor modifi cations to meet your needs. In most 
cases, though, you’ll use the manual method.
 
7. Ensure that the Manual option is selected.
 
8. Click the OK button.
 
9. Locate Explosion1 in the Model browser and click the plus sign to expand it so you can 
see a list of all the components in the assembly, as shown in Figure 11.4.
Figure 11.4

newly created pre-
sentation ﬁ le
Creating Linear Tweaks
You’ll now see the selected assembly (an arbor press assembly) in your presentation graphics 
area. It’s time to start adding tweaks to move or explode the assembly components. A tweak is 
simply a stored movement vector for a selected set of one or more components. You can defi ne 
both linear tweaks that move in an x-, y-, or z-axis and rotational tweaks that rotate around 
those axes. In the next steps, you’ll create a linear tweak by fi rst establishing a move direction, 
choosing a component to move, and then setting the move distance:
 
1. Click the Tweak Components button on the Presentation tab.
 
2. In the resulting dialog box (shown in Figure 11.5), ensure that the Direction button is 
enabled.

3. Select the yellow face of the faceplate to defi ne the direction of the tweak.
Note that the Components button in the dialog box is now enabled and ready for you to 
select the components to be moved.
 
4. Select the component with the yellow face (FACE PLATE) and all four of the components 
named CAP SCREW. Do this either in the graphics area or from the browser, as shown in 
Figure 11.6.
Figure 11.6

More on Selecting Components
If you select extra components by accident, simply hold down the Ctrl key and click them again to 
remove them from your selection set.
If you would like to select an entire subassembly, you must select it from the Model browser rather 
than the graphics area, unless you change your selection ﬁ lter.
 
5. Specify the tweak vector by choosing the Z button in the Transformations area of the dia-
log box (if it is not already selected).
 
6. Click somewhere in an empty space of the graphics area and drag your mouse pointer in 
the positive Z direction (pull toward the lower left of the screen).
 
7. Note the tweak distance reported in the dialog box as you drag. Enter 100 mm in the dia-
log box.
 
8. Click the green check mark to set the distance.
 
9. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the FACE PLATE component to deselect it. Check the 
browser to ensure that it is deselected.
 
10. You’ll create a tweak for just the cap screws. This time, rather than clicking in the 
graphics window, click the triad to select the Z vector and drag the triad to 
approximately 75 mm.

544 | CHAPTER 11 PRESENTATIONS AND EXPLODED VIEWS
This simply demonstrates that the triad can be used to tweak components, allowing you 
to switch directions easily, as opposed to using the buttons in the dialog box to do this.
 
11. Enter 30 mm in the dialog box and click the green check mark to set the distance. By 
doing this you have set the tweak to 30 mm even though the initial drag value was 
approximately 75 mm. Clicking the check mark sets the fi nal tweak value.
 
12. Click the Close button in the Tweak Component dialog box.
 
13. On the Model browser, click the Filter button and choose Tweak View from the list.
 
14. You should see the two tweaks just created listed in the browser, as shown in Figure 11.7.
Figure 11.7
Setting the 
browser to view 
tweaks
Once you create a tweak or tweaks based on one set of selections and inputs, you can con-
tinue to tweak additional components with new selections and inputs by fi rst clicking the Clear 
button. This allows you to create tweaks quickly without dismissing the dialog box.
Now that you have created a basic linear tweak, in the next section you’ll explore how to cre-
ate more advanced tweaks.
Creating Advanced Presentations
In the following sections, you will look at some of the more advanced functions associated with 
creating presentations, particularly for use as 3D animations. You will explore how to create 
rotational tweaks; how to modify tweak trails; and how to group, reorder, and animate tweaks. 
You’ll also discover how to create assembly instructions and publish animations and assembly 
instructions to a lightweight DWF fi le that can be easily shared.
Creating Rotational Tweaks
You can add rotational tweaks in much the same way you created the linear tweaks, though 
rather than indicating the x-, y-, or z-axis for linear direction, you’ll use the x-, y-, or z-axis as an 
axis of rotation and enter the tweak value as degrees of rotation rather than a linear distance. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. You can continue using the open fi le where you left off in the previous section or you can 
open mi_11a_001.ipn in the Chapter 11 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 
folder. Click the Tweak Components button on the Presentation tab.

CREATING ADVANCED PRESENTATIONS | 545
 
2. In the resulting dialog box, ensure that the Direction button is enabled.
 
3. Select the shaft of one of the cap screws.
 
4. With the Components button enabled, select the same cap screw.
 
5. In the Transformations area of the dialog box, make sure the z-axis button is selected.
 
6. Switch the radio button to select the rotational option rather than the linear one.
 
7. Enter 6.25 * 360 in the input box (for six and a quarter revolutions of 360 degrees), as 
shown in Figure 11.8.
Figure 11.8
Rotational 
tweak inputs
 
8. Click the green check mark to set the rotation.
 
9. In the browser, confi rm that the tweak is listed.
 
10. Click Clear to remove the selections and inputs from the dialog box.
 
11. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for the other three cap screws.
 
12. Once you’ve added rotational tweaks for each cap screw, click Close to continue.
Creating Tweaks with Drag and Drop
If you’re tweaking only one component at a time and you’re comfortable with the selection, ori-
entation, and direction behavior, you can establish direction, choose your component, and input 
the tweak distance all by dragging and dropping the selected component. You can try this with 
the light blue gib plate:
 
1. Start the Tweak Component tool.
 
2. Click the front face of the gib plate, continue holding the left mouse button while drag-
ging the plate away from the main assembly, and then release the mouse button when 
you’ve moved it out approximately 45 mm.
Your presentation should look similar to Figure 11.9. You can close this fi le without saving 
changes; you will open another IPN fi le to continue in the following sections.

Figure 11.9
Creating tweaks
Understanding Tweak Trails
Trails are added by default. A trail is a line (or an arc in the case of a rotation tweak) that is dis-
played in the graphics area showing the start and endpoints of a particular tweak. By default, 
the start and endpoints are defi ned by the three-dimensional geometric center of all the com-
ponents that are chosen for a tweak. However, an optional fourth step in the tweak-creation 
process is to manually select the tweak points by clicking one or more points on each of your 
selected components. Here are a few more points to know about trails:
 
◆
By default, one trail is added per selected component in your tweak.
 
◆
Deselecting the Show Trails check box when creating tweaks will turn off the visibility of 
all tweak trails.
 
◆
You can control the visibility of individual tweak trails by expanding a tweak in the Model 
browser, right-clicking the component name, and choosing Visibility (assuming tweak 
view is being used).
 
◆
You can control the visibility of trails for each component by right-clicking a component 
and choosing Hide Trails.
 
◆
You can edit a tweak by right-clicking the trail and choosing Edit or by clicking and drag-
ging the endpoint of a tweak trail.
 
◆
You can delete a tweak or delete a component from a multiple-component tweak by right-
clicking the trail and choosing Delete.
 
◆
These trails are also visible in drawing views of presentations.
More About Tweaks
Don’t forget that the browser fi lter controls the way tweaks are listed in the browser. When in 
the assembly view, as you create a tweak a browser node representing that tweak is generated in 
your browser and nested under the selected components that are part of that tweak.

CREATING ADVANCED PRESENTATIONS | 547
Editing Tweak Values
In the tweak view, tweaks are listed as line items and the components are nested below them. 
By selecting a tweak in the browser, you can edit the movement value in the input box that 
appears at the bottom of the browser. In Figure 11.10, a 45 mm tweak is selected, and a new 
value of 60 mm has been entered.
Figure 11.10
Editing tweak 
values
Adding and Removing Components Used in Tweaks
You can add or remove components from an existing tweak by clicking the Filter button and 
choosing Tweak View from the list. To remove a component from a tweak, right-click it and 
choose Delete. This doesn’t delete the component from the assembly; it just removes the compo-
nent from the tweak.
To add a component to a tweak, expand the assembly model tree in the browser, select the 
component to be added, and then drag and drop it onto the Tweak node in the browser. You’ll 
see a black bar appear in the browser when your cursor is in a valid location.
Create Multiple Views/Explosions
If your assembly is large or complex, consider making several explosions and tweaking only a 
few components per explosion. You can add explosions by clicking the Create View tool. Each 
subsequent time the Select Assembly dialog box is shown, however, a new assembly fi le cannot 
be specifi ed. You can choose a different view, positional, or LOD representation than you used 
for your previous explosions. Figure 11.11 shows a presentation with three explosions created. 
Explosion 3 contains just one Translate tweak, which has been expanded to show the two com-
ponents involved in that tweak.

548 | CHAPTER 11 PRESENTATIONS AND EXPLODED VIEWS
Figure 11.11

2D Presentations Views
If the end goal of your presentation is to create an explosion that looks good in one or more 2D 
drawing views, then you already know just about everything you need to know, and you never have 
to use more than the Create View and Tweak Components tools inside the presentation environ-
ment. You can learn more about creating views in 2D drawings in Chapter 12, “Documentation.”
Save Camera
Before you save your presentation fi le and move on to creating a drawing fi le that uses the 
exploded view, make sure to set your camera view up exactly as you’d like to see it on the page. 
Use Zoom, Orbit, and the ViewCube in conjunction with the Precise View Rotation tool to get 
a view that makes things as clear as possible. Then right-click in the graphics area and choose 
Save Camera. You can use this saved camera to create a view in the 2D drawing. You can also 
right-click and choose Restore Camera any time you have changed the camera view, as shown in 
Figure 11.12.
Figure 11.12

CREATING ADVANCED PRESENTATIONS | 549
Understanding Group, Reorder, and Animate Tweaks
You can group and reorder tweaks for the purpose of animating components in a presentation. 
For instance, in the steps in the section “Creating a Basic Explosion” earlier in this chapter, you 
pulled the cap screws out all at once and then rotated them one at a time. You may want to have 
these actions separated, reordered, or grouped in order for them to behave correctly when ani-
mated. To see how this works, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_11a_002.ipn in the Chapter 11 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. If you have zoomed or orbited the assembly, right-click and choose Restore Camera.
 
4. On the Presentation tab, click the Animate button.
 
5. In the Animation dialog box, click the >> button (at the bottom-right corner) to expand 
the dialog box so you can view the animation sequence, as shown in Figure 11.13.
Figure 11.13
Tweak sequences 
in the Animation 
dialog box
You’ll notice there are currently seven sequence steps. Next, you’ll group some of them to 
reduce the number of sequence steps used.

6. Click the Play Forward button to animate the tweaks; note how the rotation tweaks just 
spin in place.
 
7. Click the Reset button.
 
8. In the Animation Sequence area, hold down Ctrl on the keyboard and select all of the 
rotation tweaks (2250 deg) and all of the 30 mm tweaks.
 
9. Click the Group button to group these tweaks into a single sequence step.
 
10. Click the gib plate and use the Move Up button to change it to sequence step 1.
 
11. When the gib plate is sequence step 1 and the group of 2250 deg and 30 mm tweaks are 
sequence step 2, as shown in Figure 11.14, click the Apply button.
Figure 11.14
Reordered tweak 
sequence
 
12. Click the Play Forward button to animate the tweaks and note that the cap screws now 
rotate and move at the same time.
 
13. Click the Reset button and the Cancel button to exit the Animation dialog box.
Note that the Cancel button does not undo the changes you just made and should be 
labeled Done rather than Cancel.
 
14. In the Model browser, click the Filter button and choose Sequence View from the list.
 
15. Expand the Task node to see the sequence steps.
You’ll notice the sequences correspond with the groups you created in the previous steps. 
This is essentially the same set of steps you saw in the Animation dialog box.
Here are more things to know about working with sequences in the browser:
 
◆
You can drag and drop the sequences in the browser to reorder them.
 
◆
You can expand the browser node for each sequence to see the list of components grouped 
in the sequence.

CREATING AND SHARING ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS | 551
 
◆
To remove a component from a sequence, you can right-click it in the browser and 
choose Delete.
 
◆
To remove a component from a sequence and add it to a new sequence, you can right-click 
it in the browser and choose New Sequence.
Although the rotation of the cap screws is still not true to life in this example, you should be 
able to see that you can create tweaks in any order you choose and then group and reorder them 
as required later until you get the result you need. Feel free to experiment with this fi le to add, 
remove, group, or reorder tweaks as you see fi t to get the screws to rotate and move into place 
realistically. When fi nished, you can close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the 
next section.
Recording Exploded Presentations
Many design departments use presentations to create short animated movie ﬁ les to be viewed by the 
people on the shop ﬂ oor who assemble the product. You can use the Record button in the Animation 
dialog box to save an AVI or WMV movie ﬁ le of your assembly being assembled or disassembled.
Other companies use these tools to record assembly movies for customer support when dealing 
with replacement part installation, posting them online, or including them on a disc.
When creating movie ﬁ les in this way, you may ﬁ nd it best to create shorter clips and then use 
video-editing software (often included with Windows) to put the clips together and add voiceover 
or text slides.
Creating and Sharing Assembly Instructions
You can create assembly instructions for a presentation animation to share with a customer, to 
present to a group, or to be used by people on the shop fl oor. The animations and instructions 
can be published to a DWF fi le and viewed with the free Autodesk® Design Review application. 
Or you can use the .DWFx extension and use Microsoft Internet Explorer as the viewer. Follow 
these steps to explore how to create assembly instructions:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_11a_003.ipn in the Chapter 11 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. In the Model browser, click the Filter button and choose Sequence View from the list.
 
4. Locate Explosion2 in the browser and double-click it to activate it.

552 | CHAPTER 11 PRESENTATIONS AND EXPLODED VIEWS
Creating Multiple Explosions
Recall that you can create multiple explosions of the same assembly by using the Create View 
button. Each view becomes a separate explosion with a diﬀ erent camera view. You might show 
the assembly of external housing components in Explosion1 and then use Create View to create 
a second explosion. In Explosion2, you can turn oﬀ  the visibility of the housing components and 
concentrate on just the internal components. Remember, too, that if you have created view or LOD 
representations to control the visibility of internal and external parts, you can use them when 
creating the explosion by clicking the Options button.
You can also copy existing explosions by right-clicking an explosion in the browser and choosing 
Copy. Th en right-click in the IPN ﬁ lename node (the topmost node) in the browser and choose 
Paste from the context menu.
 
5. Expand Explosion2 to see that there are two tasks within it.
 
6. Double-click Task2a to activate it.
 
7. In the resulting Edit Task & Sequences dialog box, click the Play button at the top.
 
8. Click Reset when it is done playing.
 
9. Click the Play button in the middle to play just Sequence 1.
 
10. Click Reset when it is done playing.

14. Click the Sequence1 Play button to view the faster playback, and click Reset when 
fi nished.
 
15. Switch the Sequences drop-down from Sequence1 to Sequence2.
 
16. Note that the instructions have been fi lled out already.
 
17. Use the ViewCube, the Orbit tool, or your 3D controller to change the camera view so that 
you can see the ram and the shaft without obstruction. Zoom in as you see fi t.
 
18. Click the Set Camera button.
 
19. Click the Apply button.
 
20. Click the Play button at the top to see the entire Task2a play back again. Note the changes 
to the camera view you made.
 
21. Click the OK button.
Here are a couple of other actions you can take to organize tasks:
Create Tasks  When you create tweaks within an explosion, they are initially all created in 
a single task. To create multiple tasks, use the fi lter to set the view to sequence view and then 
right-click an explosion and choose Create Task. Then just drag the sequences into the task as 
needed.
Hide Components  You can hide components per sequence by expanding the sequence 
while in sequence view and revealing the Hidden folder. Then just select the component from 
the model tree and drag it up into the Hidden folder. If it appears in the Hidden folder of a 
sequence, that component will not be visible for that particular sequence.
If you need to share assembly animations and instructions with someone who does not 
use Inventor, such as the people on the shop fl oor, you can publish the presentations to a DWF 
(.dwf) fi le:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_11a_004.ipn in the Chapter 11 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Click the Inventor button and choose Export ➢ Export To DWF.
 
4. In the Publish Presentation dialog box, select one of the following:
Express  Static exploded views are published. BOM data, design views, and positional 
representations are not published.
Complete  The DWF fi le contains all presentation views, including animations, assem-
bly instructions, and the associated assembly as well as its design views, positional repre-
sentations, and BOM.
Custom  You have full control over which animations and assembly instructions are 
included or excluded as well as whether to include the assembly, the BOM, and so on.
Figure 11.16 shows the Publish Presentation dialog box.

6. Click Publish.
 
7. Set the fi lename and location as you see fi t and choose DWF or DWFx for the fi le type.
 
8. Click Publish.
The key differences between the two DWF fi le types is that the 2D DWFx can be read by 
Windows Vista and XP (with Internet Explorer 7 or newer installed) without the need for an 
extra viewer such as Autodesk Design Review. 3D DWFx and DWF fi les still require Design 
Review. Note too that the DWFx fi le is generally about twice as large.
You can invite vendors and clients as well as the shop fl oor to download Design Review for 
free from the Autodesk website.
Display Published File in Viewer for DWF and PDF
At the bottom of the Publish Presentation dialog box, there is a check box allowing you to choose 
whether the published ﬁ le will automatically be displayed in the designated viewer application 
(typically Design Review for DWF ﬁ les). Be aware that this option also controls whether PDFs that 
are generated using Export To PDF are automatically displayed in the designated PDF application. 
If you’d rather not have Design Review or Adobe Reader open each time you save a DWF or PDF, 
uncheck this option.
Th e Bottom Line
Create an exploded assembly view by creating a presentation.  Presentation fi les are used 
to virtually disassemble an assembly so downstream consumers can better visualize the 
design. The explosion created in the presentation fi le can be referenced in an assembly draw-
ing to complement nonexploded assembly views.
Master It  Your assembly design is complex and contains many internal components 
that can’t be visualized in traditional assembly drawing views. What is a good approach 
to showing those components?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 555
Create basic linear tweaks.  Tweaks are used to move (or translate) components along a 
specifi ed axis. This allows you to pull your assembly apart in order to show how it goes 
together.
Master It  Your assembly design includes a number of hardware connections, and you’d 
like to show how they go together in a clear and concise way. How should you do this?
Create rotational tweaks.  Rotational tweaks allow you to move components in an orienta-
tion that is not along the standard x-, y-, and z-axes and that can be used to show rotation of 
parts for animations.
Master It  Your assembly has a housing that you’d like to tip out of the way to show both 
the parts within and the connection features of the housing. When you apply a linear 
tweak, you can move the housing up and off the assembly to show the parts, but you can-
not see the connection features. What do you need to do to see the connection features?
Group, reorder, and animate tweaks.  Once tweaks are created, you may want to group 
several of them together into the same sequence of steps and reorder them to show a specifi c 
assembly step in an animation.
Master It  You want to create an animated assembly presentation of your assembly go-
ing together, but when creating the tweaks, you did so by going from top to bottom of 
the assembly rather than following the order in which the assembly would actually take 
place. Can this be resolved?
Publish presentation fi les.  Although you can place views of your presentation fi le on a 2D 
drawing, it can be helpful to include the 3D animation for customers and colleagues in the 
form of a DWF or DWFx fi le.
Master It  You want to supply the shop fl oor with assembly instructions of your assem-
bly going together. What is a good way to do this ?


Chapter 12
Documentation
At any point in your design process, you can choose to begin documenting your design with the 
Autodesk® Inventor® program. Although creating drawings was traditionally something that 
had to wait until the design was fully complete, there are no such restrictions in Inventor. You 
can start to develop an annotated 2D drawing fi le at any point in your process. It is generally 
recommended, however, that you start documenting as late in the design as possible.
The ultimate goal of this chapter is to illustrate how you can use the Drawing Manager in 
Inventor to generate traditional 2D annotated drawings. You can then output your documenta-
tion in a variety of fi le formats, including DWF and PDF.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Create and maintain drawing templates, standards, and styles
 
◆
Generate 2D drawing views of parts, assemblies, and presentations
 
◆
Annotate drawing views of your model
Using the Drawing Manager
Once you have created your 3D design, you can choose to document it with conventional 2D 
orthographic drawing views and traditional drafting tools. This kind of documentation is 
 created in the Drawing Manager environment.
These high-level Drawing Manager tasks are discussed in the following sections:
 
◆
Creating templates and styles
 
◆
Utilizing drawing resources
 
◆
Editing styles and standards
 
◆
Creating drawing views
 
◆
Annotating part drawings
 
◆
Annotating assembly drawings
 
◆
Working with sheet-metal drawings
 
◆
Working with weldment views
 
◆
Working with iParts and iAssembly drawings
 
◆
Sharing your drawings outside your workgroup

558 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Creating Templates and Styles
Although several drawing templates are installed with Inventor, before you begin to document your 
own designs and models, you should create your own custom template or templates to best meet 
your needs. This is because most users have to adhere to a specifi c set of drafting standards dictated 
by their company, customer, or vendor specifi cations. These standards are typically derivatives of one 
of several international drafting standards such as ANSI, ISO, or DIN. Therefore, Inventor installs 
with a set of templates and drafting styles confi gured for the following international standards:
 
◆
ANSI (both Imperial and metric units)
 
◆
BSI
 
◆
DIN
 
◆
GB
 
◆
GOST
 
◆
ISO
 
◆
JIS
When creating your own custom template, it is sometimes best to start with a standard tem-
plate that closely meets your requirements and modify the styles already found within it as 
needed. At other times it might be best to create a template from a “clean” template fi le that con-
tains no styles and create them yourself.
Creating templates in the Drawing Manager is not unlike creating templates in other appli-
cations. The primary difference is that many applications use a special fi le format for template 
fi les, whereas Inventor uses the same fi le format but uses a folder location to designate all fi les 
within the template location as templates. As a result, you can use any IDW or DWG fi le as a 
drawing template; you just need to save it in the template location.
To create a drawing template from an existing, Autodesk-provided template, follow these 
general steps:
 
1. Click the New File button from the Get Started tab.
 
2. Choose an IDW or DWG template that is close to your needs (for instance, you might 
select the DIN.idw fi le if your company uses the DIN standard).
 
3. Click the Inventor button (the large I in the upper-left corner) and choose Save As ➢ Save 
Copy As Template.
 
4. Create a new folder for your custom template location.
 
5. Rename your custom template to a name of your choice.

CREATING TEMPLATES AND STYLES | 559
 
6. Make changes to the styles and standards as needed and then use the Save Copy As 
Template option to update the template fi le.
To create a drawing template from a “clean” template fi le that contains no styles, follow these 
general steps:
 
1. Hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys and click the New File button from the Get Started tab, 
as shown in Figure 12.1.
 
2. Select Drawing from the New dialog box and then click the OK button.
 
3. Click the Inventor button and choose Save As ➢ Save Copy As Template.
 
4. Create a new folder for your custom template location.
 
5. Rename your custom template to a name of your choice.
 
6. Make changes to the styles and standards as needed and then use the Save Copy As 
Template option to update the template fi le.
Understanding Template Locations
By default, Inventor templates are stored in and accessed from C:\Users\Public\
Documents\Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Templates. You set the default location initially 
from the Tools tab by clicking the Application Options button and then selecting the File 
tab and entering a folder location in the Default Templates box. For stand-alone users 
working on a local drive, consider using the same location where you store your design 
projects for your template file location. If you’re part of a networked design group, you 
should create a template folder on a shared network drive and change the default template 
path accordingly.
The default template location can be overridden on a per-project basis as well by setting the 
template location in the project fi le confi guration. Keep in mind that if you have a template loca-
tion set in Application Options and another set in the project fi le, the project fi le always takes 
precedence. Setting the template path in the project and having everyone use the same project 
fi le can often be the best way to ensure that all members of the design group are using the 
same templates.

Standard Templates
If you use the New File drop-down menus to access templates, you should know that these tem-
plates are hard-coded to use ﬁ les named Standard.ipt, Standard.iam, Standard.ipn, and 
Standard.idw (or .dwg) located at the route of your template location. If you remove or rename 
the ﬁ les named Standard, the drop-down menus will not work. Unfortunately, there is no way to 
point the drop-downs to use a template of a diﬀ erent name. However, if you create a copy of your 
template ﬁ les, place them at the root of your template directory, and name them Standard, you 
can then access your customized templates using the standard drop-down menus.
Choosing a File Format
Prior to Inventor 2008, the IDW fi le format was the only native 2D fi le type recognized by 
Inventor. DWG TrueConnect, introduced with Inventor 2008, enables you to use both DWG and 
IDW as valid fi le formats in the Drawing Manager.
Using DWG as your fi le format enables you to open Inventor DWG fi les in the AutoCAD® 
program (or an AutoCAD vertical product such as AutoCAD® Mechanical) without going 
through a translation process. Although the data you create natively in Inventor cannot be 
manipulated directly in AutoCAD, all of the Inventor data can be viewed, measured, and 
printed using conventional AutoCAD commands.
By choosing DWG as your default fi le format, you allow downstream users of your designs to 
view the 2D drawing documents in AutoCAD without having to purchase or install Inventor or 
download the Inventor fi le viewer. Vendors, customers, or other internal personnel can open the 
native Inventor DWG fi le and view, measure, and print the Inventor data, or they can even add 
AutoCAD data to the fi le to create a hybrid document that can be viewed quickly and effi ciently 
in either application. AutoCAD users with older versions of AutoCAD might need to download 
the Autodesk DWG TrueConnect Object Enablers to view the Inventor proxy objects. Use the 
search phrase TrueConnect Object Enabler to locate the downloads online.
Be Aware of File Size
Although many design departments ﬁ nd the convenience of having their Inventor drawings in DWG 
format well worth it, you should understand that Inventor DWG ﬁ les will be larger than Inventor 
IDW ﬁ les. Th e diﬀ erence in size may vary depending on the content, but diﬀ erences of up to three 
times as large can be common. Save a dozen typical drawing ﬁ les as both Inventor DWG and IDW 
and compare the sizes yourself to determine which is right for you.
For Inventor users, there is essentially no difference between using DWG and using the tra-
ditional IDW fi le format. The native DWG fi le includes a Layer 0 in the layer list and an AutoCAD 
Blocks folder in Drawing Resources. These are the only noticeable differences between the 
two fi le formats. An IDW fi le can always be saved as an Inventor DWG, and vice versa, without 
any loss of fi delity or data. If there’s a good chance of someone wanting to see a DWG version 
of your Inventor fi le, you might consider choosing DWG as your default fi le format. The Task 
Scheduler in Inventor enables you to batch-convert a set of IDW fi les into DWG fi les.

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 561
Utilizing Drawing Resources
You should customize three areas of the template to conform to your chosen drafting  
standards and personal preferences: Drawing Resources, Document Settings, and Styles 
And Standards.
Drawing resources are simply a collection of reusable sketches and formats that are stored 
in a drawing fi le. There are four types of drawing resources: sheet formats, borders, title blocks, 
and sketched symbols. If you’ve decided to use DWG as your template format, you’ll notice that 
AutoCAD blocks are also managed as Inventor drawing resources.
Drawing resources are accessed from your drawing browser under the Drawing 
Resources folder, as shown in Figure 12.2. If you expand the Drawing Resources node, you’ll 
see a folder for each of the drawing resource types listed, and contained in each of the subfold-
ers are drawing-resource defi nitions. Double-click any drawing resource to place an instance in 
your drawing.
You can employ several document-management techniques with respect to templates, sheet 
sizes, borders, and title blocks. Although you could create and maintain separate drawing 
templates for each sheet size and title block you might need, it’s generally recommended that a 
single drawing template be used to maintain each of these different confi gurations. In the fol-
lowing sections, you’ll take a look at the various drawing resources.
Sheet Size
When you start a new drawing from one of the templates installed with Inventor, a border and 
title block are already present on the sheet, and the sheet is set to a default size. You can change 
the default sheet size by right-clicking the sheet in the browser and choosing Edit Sheet from the 
context menu. For example, if you are using the ANSI (in) template, the default sheet size is C. If 
you change the sheet size to D, the border on the sheet updates automatically to accommodate 
the change in sheet size.
To have your templates default to a different sheet size, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse to your template location and open a drawing fi le, such as Standard.idw (see the 
section “Understanding Template Locations” earlier in this chapter).
 
3. Right-click the sheet in the browser and choose Edit Sheet.

4. Click the arrow in the drop-down box and choose the size or sheet format from the list.
 
5. Click the Inventor button and choose Save (or press Ctrl+S on the keyboard).
Now when you start a new fi le from the template, this new sheet size will be active.
Multiple Sheets
If needed, you can add sheets to your template, which is recommended if most of your design doc-
uments require more than one sheet. To insert a new sheet into your document, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any blank area on the page and choose New Sheet (or click the New Sheet but-
ton on the Place Views tab).
 
2. Note that this adds the border and title block and the same size sheet as the active sheet.
 
3. To switch between sheets, double-click the sheet node in the browser.
Multiple Sheet Drawing Files
Use caution when creating multiple sheet sets of a sizable number because performance will likely 
suﬀ er, depending on the size and complexity of the models you are detailing. Be aware too of “put-
ting all of your eggs in one basket” should a ﬁ le become corrupted or lost. It is generally considered 
best practice to create a single drawing for each part number in an assembly, rather than attempting 
to manage an entire drawing set for an assembly in a single drawing ﬁ le. However, certain industries 
approach this aspect of drawing sets diﬀ erently.
Creating a Border
The default border used on the Inventor templates may not meet your needs. To create a new 
border, you’ll fi rst follow these steps to remove the instance of the old border:
 
1. Expand the sheet node in the browser.
 
2. Right-click the border instance, and choose Delete.
Doing so removes the instance of the border from the sheet. The border defi nition is still 
stored in the Borders folder of the Drawing Resources node. To create a new, custom border in 
your template, follow these steps:
 
1. In your template fi le, expand the Drawing Resources node in the browser.
 
2. Right-click the Borders folder and choose Defi ne New Border. You might have the option 
to choose Defi ne New Zone Border, but you’ll use a simple border here to explore the 
steps required. Here is a brief description of both border types:
Defi ne New Zone Border  Brings up an input dialog box where you can specify the 
number of horizontal and vertical zones, alpha or numeric zone labels, font and font size, 
and margin spacing. A sketch is created from your input automatically.
Defi ne New Border  Creates a sketch with the four corners of the sheet projected in. You 
can sketch a rectangle to create a simple custom border and use dimensions to specify the 

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 563
margins from the sheet corners. Dimensioning to the sheet corners allows your border to 
automatically resize to any sheet size, holding the specifi ed margins. Borders can be as 
simple or complex as required, but the sketch should always be fully constrained.
 
3. On the Sketch tab, select the Two Point Rectangle tool.
 
4. Sketch a small rectangle on the screen; ensure that you do not sketch it on the sheet cor-
ners because this will constrain the rectangle to the corners.
 
5. On the Sketch tab, select the Dimension tool.
 
6. Place dimensions from the corners of your rectangle to the projected corner points of the 
sheet so that the edges of the rectangle will be 10 mm from the edge of the sheet.
Formatting Color and Line Weight in a Border Sketch
By default, all geometry created in a border is set on a layer named Border. You can change the 
color and line weight of that layer to modify all the entities of your border, or you can override 
the properties of individual entities as required. To do the latter, right-click the object you want 
to modify and select Properties.
 
7. When your border sketch is complete, right-click and choose Save Border (or click the 
Finish Sketch button on the Sketch tab).
 
8. Enter the name of your border defi nition.
 
9. Click Save.
 
10. Look in the Borders folder of the Drawing Resources node in the browser for your new 
border defi nition.
 
11. Right-click your border and choose Insert to place an instance of it on the current sheet.
 
12. If you need to modify the border defi nition, right-click your border instance or the defi ni-
tion in Drawing Resources and choose Edit Defi nition or Edit.
Because the border is dimensioned to the edge/corners of the sheet, if you edit the sheet size, the 
border will automatically resize as needed, holding the margin distance, 10 mm in this example.
Creating a Title Block
Title blocks are customized in much the same way borders are customized. Title blocks typically 
contain more text-based information than borders, so the focus will be on creating sketch text in 
this section. There are three common ways of creating a custom title block:
 
◆
You can use an existing title block originally drawn in AutoCAD.
 
◆
You can modify a default Inventor title block.
 
◆
You can create one completely from scratch in Inventor, drawing the line work and insert-
ing the text fi elds.
In this section, you will bring in an existing AutoCAD title block and make it intelligent to 
Inventor. In doing so, you will explore the tools used to create a title block employed in the other 

564 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
tile block creation methods mentioned. You should probably fi rst delete the default title block 
from your current sheet before creating a new title block, just to reduce confusion. 
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 12 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/master-
inginventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the 
download and setup instructions.
Once you’re sure you have the Chapter 12 fi les in place, follow these steps to explore the 
 creation of a title block:
 
1. From your template fi le (or any standard Inventor drawing fi le), expand the sheet node in 
the browser.
 
2. Right-click the title block instance and choose Delete.
 
3. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
4. Browse for mi_12a_033.dwg in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder. You may need to change the Files Of Type drop-down to All Files or 
AutoCAD Drawings (*.dwg) to locate the fi le.
 
5. Click the Options button in the Open dialog box.
 
6. Ensure that Open is selected; otherwise, Inventor will take you to the DWG/DXF File 
Wizard.
 
7. Click the OK button.
 
8. Click the Open button.
Notice that when you open an AutoCAD drawing in Inventor, you can view and measure 
the fi le. You should see a black background, and if you check the browser, you will see 
that you are viewing the model space environment of the fi le.
 
9. Right-click the title block and choose Copy.
 
10. Use the Open Documents tabs at the bottom of the screen to switch back to your template 
fi le (or press Ctrl+Tab on the keyboard).
 
11. In the Drawing Resources folder in the browser, right-click the Title Blocks folder and 
choose Defi ne New Title Block. This will place you in the Sketch environment.
 
12. Right-click in the graphics area and choose Paste.
 
13. Click in the middle of the sheet to place the title block.
You’ll notice that the line work is underconstrained and not dimensioned at all. You can 
take the time to dimension it if you’d like, but because this will become a block and there-
fore a static entity, you most likely will not need to do so.
Continue adding intelligence to the text now.
 
14. Right-click the text fi eld containing CDW and choose Edit Text.
 
15. In the Format Text dialog box, select the text and press Delete on the keyboard.
 
16. Locate the Type drop-down and set it to Properties–Drawing, as shown in Figure 12.3.

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 565
 
17. Set the Property drop-down to Designer.
 
18. Click the Add Text Parameter button  to set the Designer property to the text fi eld.
 
19. Click the OK button.
 
20. Repeat steps 14 through 19 for the date fi eld directly to the right of the fi eld you just 
edited. Use the Creation Date property instead of Designer.
 
21. Right-click and choose Save Title Block (or click the Finish Sketch button on the 
Sketch tab).
 
22. Enter a name for the new title block defi nition, such as My Title Block.
 
23. Look in the Title Block folder of the Drawing Resources node in the browser for your 
new title-block defi nition.
 
24. Right-click your title block and choose Insert to place an instance of it on the current sheet.
 
25. If you need to modify the title block defi nition, right-click your title block instance or the 
defi nition in Drawing Resources and choose Edit Defi nition or Edit.
Obviously, you have not confi gured the entire title block at this point, but before going any 
further, it is important to understand where the properties you linked to the title block text 
fi elds are coming from. You can fi nd these properties in the fi le iProperties. Follow these steps 
to change an iProperty in the drawing fi le and see that change show up in the title block:
 
1. Click the Inventor button and choose iProperties.
 
2. On the iProperties Project tab, change the Designer input to Test Designer.
 
3. Change the Creation Date input fi eld to 1/1/2015.
 
4. Click the OK button to apply the changes and close the iProperties dialog box.

566 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Your title block will have updated the two fi elds automatically based on the iProperty 
changes you made, demonstrating that you have linked those fi elds to the iProperties of this 
particular drawing fi le. If you intend to use this title block for your drawing template, you 
should continue to confi gure your title block to retrieve the iProperties needed, until all of the 
fi elds are automatically fi lled out by updating the iProperties. For now, you can close the fi le 
you have open without saving changes and continue to the next section to learn more about 
iProperties.
iProperties and Title Blocks
Each Inventor fi le has its own set of iProperties, allowing you to pull information from that fi le 
into your title block. There are two distinct methods you can use to retrieve iProperties into 
your title block:
 
◆
You can retrieve iProperties from the drawing fi le.
 
◆
You can retrieve iProperties from the model fi le that is referenced in the drawing fi le.
The following is a list of the standard iProperties available. Each of these can be accessed 
from the Type drop-down in the Text Format dialog box as described in the previous steps. 
You’ll learn more about iProperties in Chapter 13, “Tools Overview.”

Linking Your Model and Drawing iProperties
Often, you will want the iProperties for the model ﬁ le and drawing ﬁ le to match. You can use the 
Copy Model iProperty Settings option to have this happen automatically.
To do so, open your drawing template, select the Tools tab, click Document Settings, select the 
Drawing tab in the dialog box that opens, and click the Copy Model iProperty Settings button at 
the bottom. You can have some or all of the model properties copied to the drawing.
Note that once copied, the properties do not update automatically when they are changed in the 
model. To update them, select the Manage tab and click Update Copied Model iProperties.

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 567
Follow these steps to modify a title block so it is pulling information from the model iProper-
ties. You’ll note that this title block is calling the model fi lename iProperty for the drawing title. 
Most of the other fi elds are being pulled from the drawing fi le’s iProperties. The fi eld you will be 
modifying is static and needs to be set to pull from the model fi le’s iProperties. Here are the steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_024.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the sheet node in the browser (if it is not already expanded).
 
4. Right-click the title block instance (named MI_TB_04) in the browser and choose Edit 
Defi nition.
 
5. Zoom up on the title block and locate the Part Number area toward the bottom.
 
6. Right-click the text fi eld showing ### and choose Edit Text.
 
7. In the Format Text dialog box, select the text (###) and press Delete on the keyboard.
 
8. Locate the Type drop-down and choose Properties–Model.
 
9. Set the Property drop-down to Part Number.
 
10. Click the Add Text Parameter button to set the property to the text fi eld.
 
11. Click the OK button.
 
12. Right-click and choose Save Title Block (or click the Finish Sketch button on the 
Sketch tab).
 
13. Click Yes at the Save Edits prompt.
To ensure that the part number in the title block is coming from the part model and not 
the drawing fi le, you will open the model fi le and change its iProperties.
 
14. Locate the View2:Arbor_Frame.ipt node in the browser and then right-click it and 
choose Open.
 
15. Once the part model is open, right-click the top-level node (Arbor_Frame.ipt) in the 
browser and choose iProperties.
 
16. Select the Project tab and then edit the Part Number fi eld to read 98765.
 
17. Click the Apply button and then the Close button.
 
18. Use the Open Documents tabs at the bottom of the screen to switch back to the drawing 
fi le (or use Ctrl+Tab to switch between all open documents).
You will see that the title block has read the model part number and displays the change in 
the Part Number fi eld.
Experiment with the title block to understand the way it works with iProperties from the 
model, and then you can close the fi le without saving changes. You might notice that this title 
block does not contain dimensions. Instead, the objects within it were anchored in place using 
sketch constraints.

The i CHECK IT Add-in for Inventor
Th ere are several add-ins available that check to ensure that users have not forgotten to ﬁ ll out 
required iProperties. One such add-in is i CHECK IT from Tata Technologies. i CHECK IT goes far 
beyond just checking iProperties, however; it will also check to ensure that the ﬁ lenaming conven-
tion has been followed, that the ﬁ rst sketch of a model is constrained to the origin, that all sketches 
are fully constrained, that only approved dimension styles are used, and much more. Th ere are more 
than 100 checks that can be deﬁ ned. Visit the following page to download a 30-day free trial version:

General File Properties and Title Blocks
In addition to iProperties, you can use some other standard fi le properties to fi ll out your title 
block automatically. You can access them from the Type drop-down in the Text Format dialog 
box just as you did the iProperties. Table 12.1 lists several general properties that can be called 
into a text fi eld.

1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_025.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the sheet node in the browser.
 
4. Right-click the title block instance (named MI_TB_05) and choose Edit Defi nition.
 
5. Zoom up on the title block and locate the SHEET ?? OF ??? area at the bottom right.
 
6. Right-click the text fi eld showing SHEET ?? OF ??? and choose Edit Text.
 
7. In the Format Text dialog box, select the two question marks between the word SHEET 
and the word OF and press Delete on the keyboard.

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 569
 
8. Locate the Type drop-down and choose Sheet Properties.
 
9. Set the Property drop-down to Sheet Number.
 
10. Click the Add Text Parameter button to set the Number Of Sheets property to the 
text fi eld.
 
11. Still in the Format Text dialog box, select the three question marks after the word OF and 
press Delete on the keyboard.
 
12. Locate the Type drop-down and choose Drawing Properties. (Note that there is one 
called Properties–Drawing also, so ensure that you have the correct one.)
 
13. Set the Property drop-down to Number Of Sheets.
 
14. Click the Add Text Parameter button to set the Sheet Number property to the text fi eld.
 
15. Ensure that the text in the text displays as SHEET <Sheet Number> OF <Number of 
sheets>. Then click the OK button.
 
16. Right-click and choose Save Title Block (or click the Finish Sketch button on the 
Sketch tab).
 
17. Click Yes at the Save Edits prompt.
Experiment with adding new sheets and reordering the sheets (just drag and drop the sheets 
in the browser) to see how the title block updates, and then you can close the fi le without saving 
changes.
Prompted Entry
You can also create fi elds in your title block to enter information manually using what is 
known as a prompted entry. Prompted entry text is keyed in by the user and not retrieved from 
the fi le properties in the way that iProperties are. Because of this, experienced Inventor users 
will tell you that iProperties are favored over prompted entries for two reasons.
First, information entered into a prompted entry fi eld is stored in that one title-block 
instance and nowhere else. If you need to update the title block for your entire drawing library 
at some point in the future, you can do so easily with the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard, 
which can swap out old title-block defi nitions with a new one, en masse. (See Chapter 13 for 
more on this Inventor tool.) This works well when title blocks have been populated with iProp-
erties because the information resides in the fi le, not the title block. However, if a prompted 
entry was used, that information will not be carried over because it exists only in the old title-
block instance.
Second, since iProperties are stored in the fi le, there are a couple of important tasks that can 
be performed on them:
 
◆
iProperties can be viewed, searched, and copied easily using a number of tools such as 
Find, Design Assistant, and Vault.
 
◆
Non-Inventor users can use iProperties to sign off on drawings without opening the fi le in 
Inventor.

570 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Getting in the habit of using iProperties will pay large dividends in the future, once you have 
created many Inventor fi les. With these things in mind, you should use prompted entries in title 
blocks rarely. Here are the steps for creating a prompted entry in a title block if you determine 
that it is required:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_026.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the sheet node in the browser.
 
4. Right-click the title block instance (named MI_TB_06) and choose Edit Defi nition.
 
5. Zoom up on the title block and locate the Tracking Code area at the bottom left.
 
6. Right-click the text fi eld showing ##### and choose Edit Text.
 
7. Locate the Type drop-down and choose Prompted Entry.
 
8. Replace ##### with Enter Tracking Code.
 
9. Click the OK button.
 
10. Right-click any empty space in the graphics area and choose Save Title Block.
 
11. Click Yes at the Save Edits prompt.
 
12. Enter 12345 for the tracking code, when prompted.
 
13. Click the OK button.
You can edit a prompted entry in a title block by expanding the block instance in the browser 
and double-clicking the Field Text node. If no prompted entry is established, you will only be 
able to view the fi elds. If you edit Sheet 2 and add the MI_TB_06 title block to it, you will imme-
diately be prompted for the tracking-code entry. When you’ve fi nished exploring prompted 
entries, you can close the fi le without saving changes.
Sketched Symbols
Sketched symbols are created, edited, placed, and managed much like other drawing resources, 
but there is no limit to the number of sketch symbol instances you can place on a sheet. Like 
other drawing resource defi nitions, sketched symbols are placed by double-clicking the defi -
nition node in the browser or using the User Symbols button on the Symbols panel of the 
Annotate tab.
Sketched symbols can optionally include a leader. Using a leader, you can associate a sketch 
symbol with a model so that model-specifi c properties can be displayed in the symbol. For 
example, you could create a sketch symbol that calls out a component’s mass:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_030.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the Drawing Resources browser folder.

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 571
 
4. Right-click the Sketch Symbol folder and select Defi ne New Symbol.
 
5. In the Draw panel of the Sketch tab, click the Text button (or press T on the keyboard).
 
6. Click anywhere on the page to set the text location.
 
7. In the Format Text dialog box, type in a static text string that reads Mass: (be sure to 
include a space after the colon).
 
8. Locate the Type drop-down and choose Physical Properties–Model.
 
9. Set the Property drop-down to MASS.
 
10. Click the Add Text Parameter button to set the MASS property to the text fi eld.
 
11. Click the OK button.
 
12. Right-click anywhere in the graphics area and choose the OK button.
 
13. Choose Save Sketched Symbol from the context menu.
 
14. Enter Mass for the name and click Save.
 
15. To insert the symbol into the drawing, right-click the Mass sketch symbol defi nition in 
the drawing browser and select Symbols.
 
16. Ensure that the Mass symbol is chosen from the list on the left side of the Symbols dialog 
box and select the Leader option.
 
17. Click the OK button.
 
18. Click any model edge in the drawing view.
 
19. Click again for each leader vertex you’d like and then choose Continue from the context menu.
 
20. Continue to place additional symbol instances, but be sure to point to a different Arbor 
Press component each time.
You’ll notice that the symbol in Figure 12.4 has a bit more geometry than the simple symbol 
you just created. You can make a sketch symbol as elaborate as you like, but for the purposes 
of this exercise, the Mass property reference is all that is required. A fi nished symbol named 
Mass_2 has been created for you in this drawing fi le. If the mass shows up as N/A, it indicates 
that the model needs to be updated. You can open the assembly model, select the Manage tab, 
and click the Update Mass button to do this. Then return to the drawing to see the update.

Formatting Your Text to Center Your Symbols
Generally, text objects are created with a justiﬁ cation setting other than middle center. However, 
a middle-center justiﬁ cation will allow you to center your text in the symbol geometry by using 
sketch constraints.
Here are some more sketch symbol points to remember:
 
◆
Sketched symbols are often used to create standard blocks of text notes.
 
◆
Sketched symbols can be placed as needed on new documents or placed on the template 
itself, which can be useful for standard drawing notes that will be placed in every drawing.
 
◆
If there is fi eld text in the sketch symbol, it becomes populated just like title block fi eld text 
when you create a new drawing.
 
◆
If you need to establish a symbol reference to a model but do not want to see the leader, you 
can edit the symbol and then double-click or select Edit Symbol from the symbol’s context 
menu and uncheck the leader Visibility option.
 
◆
You cannot graphically rotate or scale static sketched symbols as you can symbols that are 
not static.
 
◆
Sketched symbols placed by double-clicking the defi nition are set to Static by default; you 
can set this option prior to placement if you click the User button on the Symbols panel of 
the Annotate tab.
 
◆
Sketched symbols placed by right-clicking the defi nition and choosing Symbols or by 
clicking the User button on the Symbols panel of the Annotate tab are set to have more con-
trols than static symbols initially.
 
◆
You can switch a static symbol to be not static by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Symbol.
 
◆
When you mouse over a sketch symbol that is not static, a single blue hot point is shown 
on the center top of the symbol and four yellow hot points are displayed at the four corners 
of the symbol.
 
◆
Clicking and dragging the blue hot point causes the symbol to rotate, whereas clicking and 
dragging any of the yellow hot points enables dynamic scaling.
 
◆
You can change the insert point of a sketched symbol by adding a point to the sketch and 
then using the Set Insertion Point Grip button to mark it as the insertion point. This button 
can be found next to the Driven Dimension button on the Format panel of the Sketch tab.
 
◆
Sketched symbols can be patterned by right-clicking an instance of a symbol and choosing 
Pattern Symbol.
 
◆
Sketched symbols are a good place to use prompted entry text.
AutoCAD Blocks
Blocks created in AutoCAD can be used in Inventor in the same way sketched symbols are 
used. However, differences exist between the way they are created and used. AutoCAD blocks 

UTILIZING DRAWING RESOURCES | 573
are available for use only when you are using an Inventor DWG fi le and cannot be used in an 
Inventor IDW fi le. Also, you cannot create or edit AutoCAD blocks in Inventor. There are two 
ways to bring blocks into an Inventor DWG fi le:
 
◆
Copy and paste from AutoCAD.
 
◆
Right-click the AutoCAD Blocks folder found in the Drawing Resources folder and choose 
Import AutoCAD.
Here are some other points to remember about blocks:
 
◆
Once blocks are imported, you can scale, rotate, and pattern them by right-clicking the 
block instance.
 
◆
Blocks containing attributes can be modifi ed by right-clicking the block instance and 
choosing Edit Attributes.
 
◆
Color and layer properties can be modifi ed by right-clicking the block instance and choos-
ing Properties.
 
◆
You can create a block from your drawing views by right-clicking the browser node for the 
view and selecting Insert In Model Space from the context menu.
Sheet Formats
Sheet formats are preset collections of drawing sheets, borders, title blocks, sketched symbols, 
and/or base and projected views. They essentially give you the ability to quickly generate 
multiview drawings just by referencing a single model fi le. To create a multiview drawing, 
follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_037.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Expand the Drawing Resources browser folder.
 
4. Expand the Sheet Formats folder.
 
5. Right-click the A Size, 4 Views, 1/2 Scale format, and choose New Sheet.
 
6. Browse for mi_12a_038.ipt in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
7. Click the OK button in the Select Component dialog box.
You will note that a new sheet has been created to the specifi cations of the sheet format and 
set active. This technique is ideal if you fi nd yourself detailing similar designs of common size 
and complexity. You can close the fi le without saving changes.
To save your own sheet format, set up your sheet the way you like it, right-click the active 
sheet node in the browser, select Create Sheet Format, and then name the sheet format as 
you’d like.

574 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Here are some more sheet format points to remember:
 
◆
Only base and projected views are saved in a sheet format. Section, detail, and other such 
views will not be included.
 
◆
Placed drawing resources such as standard notes (in the form of sketched symbols) can be 
included in a sheet format.
 
◆
You can preload your drawing template as a sheet format as well. Simply open a template, 
create base and projected views of any model, and then save and close them. When you 
next use your template for a new drawing, you’ll be immediately prompted to reference a 
model fi le, and the drawing views will be automatically created.
Transfer Drawing Resources
You can copy drawing resource defi nitions from drawing to drawing by following these steps:
 
1. Right-click the defi nition of the title block, sketched symbol, or other drawing resource 
you want to copy and select Copy from the context menu.
 
2. Right-click the appropriate drawing resource node (or the Drawing Resources folder 
itself in the target document).
 
3. Select Paste.
You can use this technique to add new drawing resources and update existing resources. 
You can also select the entire Drawing Resources folder in one drawing and paste it into the 
Drawing Resources folder of another drawing. You will be prompted to replace or make a new 
instance of any duplicate resources.
The copy-and-paste technique is effi cient for single changes or transfers between two draw-
ings, but to push one or more new or updated design resource defi nitions to multiple drawings, 
use the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard discussed in Chapter 13.
Area Code Changes
In 2002, the phone number area code for Rochester, New York, and the surrounding areas changed 
from 716 to 585. Th is meant that every manufacturing, engineering, and architectural group in the 
area suddenly had hundreds and thousands of working drawings with the wrong phone number in 
the title block. Many companies that wanted or needed to update their title blocks had to manu-
ally copy and paste title blocks on each drawing in their archives (the savvier groups wrote custom 
application scripts to perform this task). Unfortunately, the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard 
was not released until some years later. It would have likely saved thousands of hours of work.
Editing Styles and Standards
As it does with color, material, lighting, and sheet-metal styles in the modeling environment, 
the Drawing Manager makes heavy use of XML-based styles. The basic framework of draw-
ing styles is no different from those in the modeling environment. Drawing style settings are 
viewed and edited using the Style And Standard Editor dialog box. They can be shared among 
a workgroup via the library that contains the modeling styles, and they can be imported and 
exported as stand-alone XML fi les.

EDITING STYLES AND STANDARDS | 575
Drawing styles differ from modeling styles more in concept than in practice, however, and 
the drawing styles themselves are a collection of drafting rules that include the following 
and many more:
 
◆
Dimension styles
 
◆
Text styles
 
◆
Balloon styles
Styles in Use, a Case Study
A standard is a collection of styles. A company called Mastering Inventor, Inc., has created a basic 
company standard using dimension styles, text styles, and balloon styles. Th e various styles’ names 
are listed here, followed by the style category:
Dim_Shop: Dimension style
Dim_Client: Dimension style
Dim_Marketing: Dimension style
Text_125: Text style
Text_250: Text style
Text_Script: Text style
Text_Partslist: Text style
Balloon_Item_Count: Balloon style
Balloon_Partnumber: Balloon style
Balloon_Partname: Balloon style
Having these styles set up allows Mastering Inventor, Inc., to create three types of standard 
drawings:
 
◆
Th e majority of the drawings are created for use by the shop ﬂ oor to make parts. Th ese draw-
ings are required to be clear, concise, and detailed with tolerances.
 
◆
Also required are client approval drawings, showing some design speciﬁ cs but also purposely 
limited in detail so that a competitor cannot manufacture from them.
 
◆
Occasionally, stylized drawings for use on the company web page or at trade shows are created.
To facilitate this, Mastering Inventor, Inc., has created a separate dimension style for each of 
these three drawing types. Th e company has also created several diﬀ erent text styles, which 
are called into the dimension styles and used independently as notes, and so on. Also created 
were balloon styles, each set up to call diﬀ erent iProperties from the models. Th is works well 
because Inventor users can quickly switch to the style needed without having to stop and deﬁ ne 
a style, override another style, or worry about not maintaining consistency and/or corrupting 
the company standard.
Th e question then becomes this: If this company has three sets of styles in the company standard, 
how does Inventor know which one to use by default? Th e answer is object defaults.

576 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
To explore the use of styles, study the scenario described in the Real World Scenario entitled 
“Styles in Use, a Case Study,” and refer to it in the example to come.
Object Defaults
The true key to understanding how styles are used to determine the formatting of everything 
you can create on a drawing sheet is the notion of object defaults.
In the case-study example, it is clear that the majority of a designer’s day-to-day drawing 
work is focused on creating prints for manufacturing. Therefore, the styles used for that type of 
drawing would be the styles set up as the object defaults. Object defaults are automatically set as 
the current styles in the template drawings. For this scenario, the object defaults would likely be 
confi gured as shown in Table 12.2.
Table 12.2: 
Object-default styles
Style type
Object default
Dimension style
Dim_Shop
Text style
Text_125
Balloon style
Balloon_Item_Count
Now that you understand the overall concept of object defaults, follow these steps to see how 
they are managed:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_041.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Zoom to the top of the drawing, and note the three balloons.
Each balloon on the sheet is using a different balloon style. Each balloon style is calling a 
different set of iProperties, as you will see by comparing the balloons to the parts list. To 
see how object defaults work, you’ll now create more balloons on the ram part, which is 
the square-shaped bar with teeth cut into it.
 
4. Select the Annotate tab and then click the Balloon button (on the right side).
 
5. Note the two style drop-downs all the way to the right of the Annotate tab. The top one 
controls layers, and the second controls styles.
 
6. Click the Style drop-down to show the available balloon styles. You should see one style 
denoted as By Standard and three listed below that, one of which is the one called out in 
the By Standard line.
 
7. Select the Balloon_Partname style from the list and then select any edge of the ram.
 
8. Drag out and place the balloon on the page by clicking.

9. Right-click and choose Continue (or press Enter on the keyboard).
 
10. Repeat steps 6 through 9 for the other two balloon styles, until you have three balloons 
on the ram part, each using a different balloon style.
 
11. Right-click and choose Cancel when complete.
This demonstrates the use of different styles and shows that one of these styles is set as 
the company standard default style. You’ll now go into the Style And Standard Editor 
and change the object default for the balloon style.
 
12. Select the Manage tab and then click the Styles Editor button. You will be presented with 
the Style And Standard Editor. (It may take a few seconds to index the styles initially.)
 
13. Ensure that the fi lter at the top right is set to Active Standard and then use the plus sign 
to expand the Balloon, Dimension, Object Defaults, and Text style categories, as shown in 
Figure 12.5. Note the style names listed under each style category. 
Look at the following items:
 
◆
Company Standard (Mastering Inventor, Inc.)
 
◆
Balloon styles
 
◆
Dimension styles
 
◆
Object Defaults (Mastering Inventor, Inc.)
 
◆
Text styles

and object defaults

578 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
 
14. Click Object Defaults (MI, Inc.).
 
15. Locate the Balloon row in the Object Type column.
 
16. Click the Object Style cell for the Balloon row and set the drop-down to 
Balloon_Item_Count.
 
17. Click the Layer cell for the Balloon row and set the drop-down to Balloons.
 
18. Click the Save button at the top of the editor.
 
19. Click Done to exit the editor.
 
20. Select the Balloon button from the right of the Annotate tab.
 
21. Select any edge of the ram and place another balloon just as you did before.
 
22. Note that the Balloon tool now defaults to the Balloon_Item_Count style and is placed on 
the Balloon layer.
When setting object defaults, you typically want to use the most common style. Of course, 
you can always use another style by manually selecting the style from the Style drop-down 
as you place the object. You can also select an existing object, and the Style and Layer drop-
downs will display that object’s style and layer, allowing you to change layer and style assign-
ment as needed.
Objects that have been set to a specifi c style, rather than following the By Standard option, 
will not update if you make any modifi cations to the object defaults. However, the objects will 
update if the specifi c style is updated. A quick way to get a set of objects (like your balloons, 
for example) to return to their object default is to window-select or Ctrl+click the objects on the 
screen and then select By Standard from the style drop-down. All the objects will update to use 
the newly selected standard.
Set the Style Drop-Down to Last Used
You can set the Style drop-down to remember the last-used object style by selecting the Tools tab, 
clicking the Application Options tab, and then selecting the Drawing tab. On the right side of the 
Drawing tab, you will ﬁ nd a Default Object Style setting. If you set the drop-down to Last Used, 
the last-used object and dimension style is the default. For example, if you are placing dimensions 
on a drawing using a fractional style but the decimal style is the default, you can set the applica-
tion option to Last Used so you do not need to keep changing the style back to fractional every 
time you access the dimension style. Th e Last Used setting is for the current editing session for the 
drawing, so if you close the ﬁ le and reopen it, the Object Default will list again, until it’s changed.
Creating Styles
As evident in the balloon example, you can have multiple styles for the same object type. Or 
you can have a single style that you always use. It’s up to you to choose how many styles you 
have for each type, and this will be dictated largely by need. Although this section will not go

through all the settings for all the styles, you will explore how to create and confi gure a new 
style as a foundation to creating all style types. Here are the steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_046.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder.
 
3. Select the Manage tab and click the Styles Editor button.
 
4. Ensure that the fi lter drop-down at the top right is set to Active Standard and then in the 
left pane expand the Text node to see the list of text styles.
 
5. Expand the Balloon node to see the list of balloon styles.
 
6. Click the balloon style named Balloon_Partnumber to display the style settings in the 
right pane.
 
7. Click the New button at the top of the editor dialog box and enter Balloon_Item_Qty for 
the style name.

14. Use the Move Down and Move Up buttons to set ITEM as the top property.
 
15. Click the OK button.
 
16. Click the Save button.
 
17. Click the Help button in the lower-left corner of the Style And Standard Editor, and notice 
that this takes you to a listing and description of each setting in the balloon style. This is 
true of all of the style types.
 
18. Close the Help dialog box and click Done in the Style Editor.
 
19. Select the Annotate tab and click the Balloon button.

style, Balloon_Item_Qty, from the list. 
 
21. Click the edges of parts to place on the drawing balloons that will list the item number 
and quantity using a script font for the text.

580 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Although the settings for each style type vary, the steps for creating them remain consistent 
throughout all styles. The steps are as follows:
 
1. Create a new style based on an existing style.
 
2. Specify substyles (if applicable).
 
3. Confi gure the style settings as desired.
 
4. Save the new style.
Working with Substyles
A basic example of a substyle in the modeling environment is the color style, which is a substyle 
of the material style. Once you apply a new material to a part, not only are you changing its 
physical parameters, but you’re also potentially changing its color so that it shows the material’s 
color substyle. In the previous balloon style exercise, you used a text substyle called Text_Script 
when creating the balloon style.
The use of substyles in the Drawing Manager is extensive. Almost every kind of annotation 
you create in a drawing contains some kind of text (dimensions, weld symbols, and parts lists), 
and many make use of leaders. The text style and leader style, therefore, are frequently used 
as substyles of other styles. This basically provides one-stop shopping if you want to quickly 
change all the text on your document. If you wanted to change the font for all text, for example, 
you wouldn’t have to go to the parts-list style and change the font, then to the dimension style 
and change the font, and so on; instead, you would simply change just one or two text styles that 
are being called into those other styles.
Substyles are coupled with their parent styles, which means a substyle cannot be purged if 
it’s in use by another style. If you cache a high-level style into your document from the library 
or if you save a high-level style into the library from your fi le, all substyles participate in those 
operations.
Styles are extremely powerful formatting tools that enable you to quickly change the entire 
face of a document. This also serves as a warning that modifying styles without understanding 
how they work can quickly generate unexpected results.
Take the Time to Understand Styles
Although there’s probably never been a single person who decided to use Inventor just for the “excit-
ing” styles and standards tools, these tools are extremely powerful, and you’ll be doing yourself a 
disservice if you don’t spend some time getting to know them. Th ey may seem complex at ﬁ rst, but 
once you understand them, they will become powerful tools. Play around with changing styles in 
a scratch drawing and see how the annotations change.
Another good resource for learning more about styles can be found by inserting the installation disc 
and clicking the Read Th e Documentation link on the ﬁ rst screen of the setup program; then click 
Fundamentals For Th e Autodesk Inventor CAD Manager under the Installation Guides category. 
Th is will open the CAD Manager Fundamentals PDF ﬁ le. If you do not have the installation discs, 
you can ﬁ nd an older copy of this document included with the tutorial ﬁ les in the Chapter 12 
directory of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.

CREATING DRAWING VIEWS | 581
Once you have a good understanding of styles, sit down with your design group and come up with 
a set of standards with which everyone is happy. Apply these styles to your documents and use 
them for a while. One of the great aspects of the style library is that if you want to make a change, 
you can make it to the library, and everyone will have access to this new/changed style each time 
they open a ﬁ le.
Drawing Style Administration
Each drawing template that comes with Inventor has a full set of styles saved (cached) in the 
drawing document. Although you can use the style library as a sharing and update tool, there 
is no direct link between objects on your sheet and styles in your library. Any in-use style is 
loaded into your document either automatically or manually.
If your project is set to use the style library (the Use Style Library setting is Yes or Read Only), 
then it’s important to keep your style defi nitions in sync between your template fi le and the 
library. If your project is using the style library, you have a style in the library that has the same 
name as a style in your template, and those styles have different settings, then the defi nition in 
the library automatically overwrites the defi nition in the template each time it’s used to start a 
new drawing (a warning dialog box is shown when this condition is detected).
The best way to ensure synchronization is to open your template fi le and run either the 
Update Styles tool (which pulls updates from the library) or the Save Styles To Style Library tool, 
depending on which way you want to transfer the styles. You can fi nd both of these options and 
the Purge tool on the Manage tab.
Creating Drawing Views
You will explore the various view-creation and editing tools in the following sections, which 
cover how to document different types of 3D models: part, assembly, sheet metal, weldment, 
and iPart/iAssembly.
Drawing views reference part, assembly, or presentation fi les. The workfl ows involved in 
creating and editing views from these different sources are similar, but with some notable 
exceptions detailed in the following sections.
Green Brackets and Raster Views
Th e Raster View option in the Drawing View dialog box creates a static raster-based view that 
approximates some view features. If this check box is selected, the computation of the view is 
quicker, but the view is less precise. Raster views can be used to speed up the drawings of large 
and complex general assemblies.
Green corner brackets around the drawing view are used to denote that a view is a raster view. 
Additionally, raster view browser nodes are marked with a red diagonal line through the browser 
node icon.
You can right-click a view in the graphics area or on a view’s browser node to toggle it between 
precise and raster view methods. You can also right-click in the graphics area and select Make All 
Views Precise or select Make All Views Raster to toggle all the views from one method to the other.

582 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Creating a Base View
Creating views in an Inventor drawing is an intuitive process. You’ll start by creating some basic 
views of a part fi le while exploring the procedure and options along the way. Before you create 
any views, fi rst open the part to become familiar with it:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_048.ipt in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Spin the part around and take a look at it using the ViewCube® or the Orbit tool. Do not 
close the part.
 
4. On the Get Started tab, click the New button.
 
5. Select the Metric node from the list on the left and then choose the ANSI(mm).idw tem-
plate from the Drawings section on the right.
 
6. On the Place Views tab, click the Base button to create a base view.
 
7. With the Drawing View dialog box open, move your mouse pointer around on the draw-
ing, and you will see a dynamic preview of the part fi le. Do not click the screen just yet, 
or you will inadvertently place the drawing view.
 
8. Note that all open model fi les are listed in the File drop-down. You can select any open 
model fi le from the list or click the Browse button to select another fi le.
 
9. In the Scale input box, enter 2 or use the drop-down to select 2:1. You can specify scales in 
fractional or decimal formats (1/2 or 0.5 both work for half-scale).
 
10. Click the lightbulb button to turn on the View/Scale label.
 
11. In the View Identifi er input, type Front.
 
12. In the Orientation pane on the right, click through the available options and watch the 
preview at your mouse pointer change. Select Top when you’ve fi nished. You’ll note that 
although the orientation is called top, you have entered Front in the view identifi er box. 
The orientation name can be considered a suggestion, and the word top will not show up 
anywhere but here.
Custom View Orientations
If the view you need to show does not exist in the Orientation pane, you can use the Change View 
Orientation button to step into the model and create any view orientation possible.
 
13. In the Style area, click just the middle button to create an unshaded view with no hidden 
lines. Note that the shaded button (blue) can be toggled on and off independently of the 
other two, but the hidden lines and no hidden lines buttons are mutually exclusive to 
one another.
 
14. Uncheck the Create Projected Views Immediately After Base View Creation check box, 
found in the lower-left corner.
 
15. Click anywhere on the page to create the view (or click the OK button).

CREATING DRAWING VIEWS | 583
Here are some tips for working with base views:
 
◆
Right-click any view and choose Open to open the model in a new window.
 
◆
Most of the options you see in the Drawing View dialog box can be altered later by editing 
the view, but it’s important to set the orientation correctly originally because it cannot be 
changed once placed.
 
◆
To delete a view, simply hover your mouse pointer over it and then select the dotted view 
boundary, right-click, and choose Delete.
 
◆
Right-click or double-click a view to edit it.
 
◆
Tangent edges and thread features that are not showing up in the view can be turned on by 
editing the view, selecting the Display Options tab, and selecting the respective boxes.
 
◆
Views can be moved by selecting the dotted view boundary that appears when hovering 
over them and dragging it into place.
 
◆
Clicking a line or lines in a view gives you control options for just those lines.
 
◆
Right-click lines, arcs, or circles and uncheck Visibility to hide those entities.
 
◆
Right-click the view and choose Show Hidden Lines to bring back lines that were hidden.
 
◆
Each base view created is listed in the browser; note the Base View button.
 
◆
Expanding the view node in the browser shows the model tree for that view where you can 
select all the edges of features at once. You can then right-click the selected objects on the 
page and toggle off the visibility, change the layer, and so on.
 
◆
To rotate a view, right-click it and choose Rotate; then select an edge to make horizontal or 
vertical, or use the drop-down to specify by angle.
 
◆
You can have as many base views as you need on a drawing, but the iProperties will be 
pulled from the fi rst view placed.
 
◆
Views can be renamed in the browser or by editing.
 
◆
To display the view name without the scale for a single view, right-click View Label and 
choose Edit View Label; then remove <Scale> from the text box.
 
◆
You can suppress a view by right-clicking it and choosing Suppress.
Once you’ve explored the settings and edit options for the base view, you can close the fi le 
without saving changes and continue.
Set View Preferences in the Standard
You can set up view preferences for your company standard by accessing the Styles Editor, select-
ing Standard, and then selecting the View Preferences tab. Th is allows you to choose which 
properties to display or not display in the view label, set the First or Th ird Angle projection, and 
much more.

Creating Projected Views
Once a base view is created, you can quickly create other views based on it without having to 
specify the model again:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_049.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select the Projected button on the Place Views tab.
 
4. Click the base view.
 
5. As you drag your mouse pointer around the base view, notice the view previews that are 
being generated.
 
6. Drag straight to the right and click. You will see a rectangular bounding box indicating 
that a view will be placed there.
 
7. Drag straight up from the base view and click, again noting the preview.
 
8. Drag diagonally up and to the right from the base view and click.
 
9. Right-click and choose Create to generate the projected views.
 
10. Expand the plus sign next to the Front view in the browser to see that the projected views 
are listed, as shown in Figure 12.6.
Here are some tips for working with projected views:
 
◆
Orthographic projected views are linked to the parent view in style and alignment and 
stacked below it in the browser tree.
 
◆
To break the style link between a projected view and its parent view, double-click to 
edit the projected view and deselect the Style From Base button in the lower right of the 
Drawing View dialog box. Then change the shading and hidden-line options as you like.
 
◆
Isometric views are not linked to the parent view in style and alignment and are listed 
separately in the browser tree.
 
◆
To break the alignment between a projected view and its parent view, right-click the pro-
jected view and choose Alignment ➢ Break. A view arrow will be placed next to the parent 
view, and the projected view will be labeled to match.

◆
To break the alignment without getting a view arrow, right-click the projected view and choose 
Rotate. You can set an already horizontal edge to be horizontal and still break the alignment.
 
◆
To reset the alignment, right-click the projected view and choose Alignment and then 
Horizontal or Vertical as appropriate. The projected view will move back into place. 
Choose In Position to link the projected view to the parent in its current position.
 
◆
By default, deleting a parent view or a base view will remove all projected views as well.
 
◆
To delete a parent view without removing the projected views, click the >> button in the 
Delete View dialog box, click Yes next to the views you want to keep and set them to No.
 
◆
Projected views can be created from views other than base views, such as detail views, sec-
tion views, and even other projected views.
 
◆
You can select the parent view fi rst and then issue the projected view tool, or you can issue 
the tool and then select the view. Either order is acceptable. If you have a view preselected 
accidentally and click the projected view button, that will be the view you are projecting.
 
◆
If you select the Create Projected Views Immediately After Base View Creation check box, 
found in the lower-left corner of the Base View creation dialog box, you can create base 
views and projected views at the same time.
 
◆
You can suppress a view by right-clicking it and choosing Suppress.
You can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue.
Moving and Copying Views
You can move drawing views between sheets by dragging and dropping the browser nodes. 
When a projected view is moved to a different sheet than its parent, a view arrow is generated 
automatically on the parent view.
To move a view, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_050.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Expand the Front view node in the browser to show projected views 2 and 3.
 
4. Click the browser node of View2 and drag it down to the Sheet2 browser node.
 
5. Rest your mouse pointer over the top of the Sheet2 browser node icon and release the 
mouse button.
 
6. Sheet2 becomes active to show you where View2 has been moved. Notice that there is a 
browser icon for the Front view with an arrow and the sheet name in parentheses. This 
indicates it is linked to the parent view on Sheet1. Notice too that the moved view has 
been renamed.
 
7. Right-click the Front view icon in the Sheet2 browser and choose Go To to be returned 
to Sheet1.
 
8. Notice that a view arrow has been created next to the Front view.

586 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
To copy a view, follow these steps:
 
1. With mi_12a_050.idw still open, make sure you are on Sheet1.
 
2. Right-click View3 and choose Copy.
 
3. Right-click the browser node for Sheet2 and choose Paste.
 
4. Sheet2 becomes active to show you where the view has been copied to. Notice that the 
new view has been named with the next available view number.
Copying and moving views is often useful when you’ve detailed a complex view on one sheet 
and then have run out of space and need to expand the drawing to another sheet. Note that when 
you copy or move a view with dimensions or other annotations applied, the annotations are 
moved or copied as well. You can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue.
Creating Section Views
Section views are created by “sketching” a line across an existing view to defi ne the section cut. 
The sketch is created automatically for you as you defi ne the section line.
To create a section view, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_051.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Place Views tab, click the Section button.
 
4. Click the Front view to choose it as the view to be sectioned.
 
5. Hold down the Ctrl key and click to the left of the view. This ensures that you do not acci-
dentally constrain the start point of your section line to any midpoints, center points, or 
endpoints.
 
6. Release the Ctrl key, drag the line across the part, and click to the right of the part, ensur-
ing that you see either a perpendicular or horizontal constraint to indicate you are get-
ting a straight line.
 
7. Right-click and choose Continue.
 
8. In the Section View dialog box, note that you can change the section identifi er, scale, style, 
and section depth. You can also create a zero-depth section called a slice. Leave all these 
options at the defaults.
 
9. Drag your cursor above the original view, and notice how the placement is constrained 
perpendicularly to the section line.
 
10. Hold down the Ctrl key and click the screen to create and place the section view any-
where you like.
 
11. Click the section arrow and drag it up or down to see the section update automatically.
 
12. To align the section view with the base view, right-click the section view and choose 
Alignment and then Vertical.

Objective

CREATING DRAWING VIEWS | 587
 
13. Click the base view to specify it as the view to align the section to.
 
14. Click the section view boundary to see how the alignment works.
Look at the browser to see how the section view was added as a child view of the base. Also, 
notice the sketch that was created on the base view listed just above the section view node 
(Figure 12.7). This sketch is the section line itself and can be edited like any other sketch. You 
can add or remove constraints (including sketch dimensions) as needed to precisely position the 
section line around your base view. You do this by right-clicking the sketch in the browser and 
choosing Edit Sketch, just as you would any other sketch.
Here are some tips for working with section views:
 
◆
Section line appearance is controlled by a layer and a style just like most other annotation 
objects. To determine which layer and style are used, switch to the Annotate tab and then 
click the section line. Note the Layer and View Annotation style in the Layer and Style 
drop-downs on the far right of the Annotate tab.
 
◆
Project a section view to create an isometric section.
 
◆
Orthographic section views are hatched automatically, but isometric sections are not.
 
◆
Edit or hide a hatch by right-clicking it.
 
◆
Display a hidden hatch or turn a hatch on for isometric section views by editing the 
view (right-click and select Edit View), selecting the Display Options tab, and selecting 
Hatching.
 
◆
You can hatch by material if you have mapped the materials and hatch patterns in your 
standard.
 
◆
Flip the section arrow direction by right-clicking the section line and choosing Reverse 
Direction.
 
◆
Show just the arrows of the section line by right-clicking the section line and choosing 
Show Entire Line.
 
◆
Edit the section depth by right-clicking the section line and choosing Edit Section 
Properties.
 
◆
To constrain a section line to the center of a hole, run your mouse over the hole to project 
the center point when you are creating the sketch line.
Figure 12.7

◆
When editing a section view, you click the Edit View Label button (it looks like a pencil). 
You can also use the Type drop-down and select View Label Properties. Then you can use 
the Property drop-down to add the parent sheet name or Index to your view label. This 
will place the parent view information in the view label for section views. This is often use-
ful when the view resides on a different sheet.
You can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue.
You defi ned the section line on the fl y during the previous exercise. Now you will bring 
in a sketch created in the part model and use it to create a section view. Figure 12.8 shows the 
sketched line in the model.
Mapping Materials to Hatch Patterns
You can set up your template to use a predeﬁ ned hatch pattern per the material of the sectioned 
part so that copper parts are hatched with one hatch pattern, mild steel parts are hatched with 
another, and so on:
 1. Select the Styles And Standards panel of the Manage tab and click Styles Editor to open the Style 
And Standard Editor.
 2. In the left pane, expand Standard and then click your standard.
 3. In the right pane, click the Material Hatch Pattern Defaults tab.
 4. Set the Default Hatch Style option for new materials added in the mapping.
 5. Click the From File button to select a part ﬁ le that contains all the material styles you want to 
import (set this up ahead of time), or use the From Style Library button.
 6. For each imported material, click the Hatch Pattern ﬁ eld and select a new hatch pattern from the 
list. Use Ctrl or Shift to change several materials at the same time.
 7. Click Save to save the changes to the current document; then click Done to close the dialog box.
To create a section from a model sketch, proceed with these steps. If you still have 
mi_12a_051.idw open, you can skip to step 3.
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_052.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.

8. This will reveal a zigzag line on the part view.
 
9. On the Place Views tab, click the Section button.
 
10. Click any part of the included sketch, or click the sketch in the browser to use it as the 
section line.
 
11. In the Section View dialog box, click the Include Slice check box and then select the Slice The 
Whole Part check box to create a zero-depth section. Leave the other options at the defaults.
 
12. Drag your cursor to the right of the original view and click on-screen to create the section.
 
13. To change the section properties, right-click the section line and choose Edit Section Properties.
 
14. Deselect the Slice The Whole Part check box and the Include Slice check box to change the 
section to a full-depth section; then click the OK button.
 
15. Right-click the hatch and choose Edit; then click the Double check box.
 
16. Click the OK button to close the Edit Hatch Pattern dialog box.
Your section should look similar to Figure 12.9.
You can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue.
Import Hatch Patterns
You can load hatch patterns from an external PAT ﬁ le to add custom hatch patterns to your draw-
ings. To do this, edit a hatch and select Other from the Pattern list and then click Load. You can 
also do this in the Style And Standard Editor to add custom hatches to your company standard.

Slice Views
Slice views are simply zero-depth section views. They are often used to create cut profi les of 
complex surfaced parts such as automobile bodies, aircraft wings, boat hulls, and so on. A slice 
view is generated by creating a sketch associated with a source view and then using that sketch 
as the slice profi le to create a slice section through a different target view. The slice is then exe-
cuted on the selected target view. Slice views can be created on part views or assembly views.
To create a Slice operation defi ned by two existing views and sketch geometry, follow these 
general steps:
 
1. Select an existing view to use as the source view (the view you will sketch the slice onto).
 
2. From the Place Views tab, click the Create Sketch button.
 
3. Create sketch geometry to defi ne an open profi le to use for the slice.
 
4. Click the Finish Sketch button to exit the sketch.
 
5. From the Place Views tab, click the Slice button.
 
6. Select a view other than the view you sketched on for the target view; you’ll see the Slice 
dialog box displayed.
 
7. Select the previously defi ned sketch profi le to use as the Slice Line Geometry selection.
 
8. You can choose to select the Slice All Parts check box in order to override the browser 
component section settings and slice all parts in the view (assuming the slice sketch runs 
through them).
 
9. Click the OK button to create the Slice operation.
When working with assemblies and the slice tool, you can control which components are sliced 
by expanding the node for the target view in the browser and then right-clicking each component 
in the view model tree and choosing an option from the Section Participation fl yout menu.
Using Slice Participation with Assembly Views
You can use the Slice tool to ﬁ ne-tune your assembly views. However, there is a trick to getting it 
to work correctly. 
 1. Start the Slice tool.
 2. Select your cutting line, but do not select the Slice All Parts check box.
 3. You will be prompted with a warning: “Th e slice operation did not result in any sliced compo-
nents….” Click the OK button in the warning dialog box. 
 4. In the browser, ﬁ nd the node for the assembly model of the sliced target view and right-click it; 
then choose Section Participation and select Slice. Th is will slice all of the parts in the assembly.
 5. Th en you can select individual components and change the Section Participation back to none as 
you see ﬁ t.
Th e trick here is that if you had selected the Slice All Parts option when creating the slice, you 
would not be allowed to control the individual section participation in the target view components.

Using Breakout Views
You can also use a breakout to show a cutaway. Unlike the Section View tool that creates a new 
view, a breakout is a cut operation you perform on an existing view. Breakouts start with a 
closed-loop profi le drawn on a view sketch, so you’ll begin there as well. It is important to note 
that in order to use a sketch for a breakout, it must be associated with the drawing view. To cre-
ate an associated sketch, fi rst select the view and then click the Create Sketch button. Clicking 
the Create Sketch button without selecting the view fi rst will result in a sketch that is not associ-
ated with any view.
To create a breakout view, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_067.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select the view named Front View. You can determine that the view is selected by looking 
at the browser; it should be highlighted.
 
4. On the Place Views tab, click the Start Sketch button.
 
5. Sketch a shape similar to Figure 12.10. The results don’t need to be exact, but you do need 
to ensure that the sketch is a closed loop.
 
6. Click the Finish Sketch button on the Sketch tab when your sketch is complete.
 
7. To ensure that the sketch has been created correctly, you can select the view on the sheet 
and drag it around a bit. If the sketch travels with the view, then it is associated with the 
view. If it stays put, it is not. You can also look at the browser and ensure that the Sketch 
node is stacked under Front View. If you see it above Front View, it is not associated and 
will not work for the breakout.
 
8. On the Place Views tab, click the Break Out button.
 
9. Select Front View.
 
10. Your sketch should automatically be selected as the profi le, provided you have only one 
unconsumed sketch. Otherwise, you will select the sketch for the profi le. If you cannot 
select the sketch, review step 3.
 
11. Make sure the Depth area is set to From Point and then click the center of the upper-
rightmost hole.
 
12. Enter a depth value of 25 mm and click the OK button.
Figure 12.10

sketch

592 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Your result should look similar to Figure 12.11. Note the Break Out view node in the browser. 
You may be able to see some portions of the internal parts because they have been cut away as 
well. You’ll explore how to control this in the coming pages; for now, you can close the fi le with-
out saving changes.
Next, you’ll open a fi le and modify a breakout view to explore the other depth options:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_072.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. In the browser, right-click the Break Out node and choose Edit Break Out. You may have 
to expand the sheet node and the Front View node to locate it.
 
4. In the Depth area, set the drop-down to To Sketch.
 
5. Select the zigzag sketch line in the top view. Recall that you created this sketch associated 
with the top view by selecting the view fi rst and then creating the view. This is required 
to use it as a To Sketch.
 
6. Click the OK button.
Examine the isometric view, and you will see that the breakout used the zigzag line as 
the depth extents and cut the internal and external parts. You can adjust this by going to 
the model tree and removing the fi le from section participation, as explained in the fol-
lowing steps.
 
7. Select the model node for Front View. Hover your mouse pointer over model nodes in 
the browser and watch the views on the sheet to make sure you are selecting the one for 
Front View.
 
8. Expand the model node to reveal all the part fi les and select the parts ending in 04 
through 07, as shown in Figure 12.12.
 
9. Right-click the selected parts, choose Section Participation, and then select None.
 
10. The views will update on the sheet to show these parts unsectioned.
 
11. In the browser, right-click the Break Out node and choose Edit Break Out. Click the 
Section All Parts check box. This will override the Section Participation settings.
 
12. Change the Depth option to To Hole and click the hole/circular edge in the view named 
Top View.

13. Click the OK button.
 
14. Notice that the zigzag sketch line reappears because it is no longer used by the breakout. 
Also notice that the breakout depth has adjusted to stop at the center of the hole.
 
15. Edit the breakout once again and set the Depth drop-down to Through Part.
 
16. In the browser, select the parts ending in 02, 03, 08, and 09 (use the Ctrl key to select mul-
tiple parts at the same time) to ensure that they are sectioned through.
 
17. Click the OK button; your results should be similar to Figure 12.13.
You can turn on the hatching of the sectioned parts in this view by editing the view (double-
click the view or right-click and choose Edit View and then select the Display Options tab 
and click the Hatching check box).

Section Participation
Section participation can be controlled per the part ﬁ le or per the part instance. If the part is a 
standard part such as a fastener, you might want to set section participation per ﬁ le so the part is 
never sectioned. If you just want to exclude a part from a particular section or breakout view for 
clarity, you can do so per instance.
To control section participation per ﬁ le, open the part ﬁ le you want to change the section participa-
tion for, select the Tools tab, select Document Settings, and then choose the Modeling tab. Uncheck 
the Participate In Assembly And Drawing Sections check box. Th e part will now default to None 
in Section Participation for new section and breakout views, but it can be set to participate on a 
per-instance basis.
To control section participation per instance, place the section or breakout view of the assembly, 
expand the view node in the browser, and then locate the browser node for the parts for which 
you want to adjust section participation. Right-click, choose Section Participation, and set it to 
None as needed.
If the part was set to be sectioned in the document settings before a view was created and you 
change the document settings so it is not to be sectioned, the drawing view will stay sectioned and 
will need to be changed per instance.
It should be pointed out that the preceding steps have created a situation that may yield incon-
sistent results by excluding some of the parts from the section participation settings and then by 
setting the depth of the breakout to Through Part. Typically, you would use the section participa-
tion settings only with the fi rst three depth options and not with the Through Part option.
You will have noticed that as you modifi ed the breakout, the isometric view was linked to 
those changes. This is because isometric projected views created for views that already have a 
breakout inherit the breakout by default. Orthographic projected views, such as the top view, do 
not inherit the breakout.
To switch the inheritance setting of the isometric view, right-click it and select Edit View. In 
the Display Options tab in the Drawing View dialog box, deselect the Break Out check box 
in the Cut Inheritance area, as shown in Figure 12.14. You can also turn on hatching from this 
tab. You can use the current fi le to explore these hatch settings, and then you can close the fi le 
without saving changes.
Using Detail Views
You can use the detail view to enlarge and segregate a particular portion of a drawing view as a 
new view. Follow these steps to explore the options of detail views:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_077.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.

3. On the Place Views tab, click the Detail button.
 
4. Click anywhere on the Front view to use it as the basis of the new detail view.
 
5. In the Detail View dialog box, you can modify the View/Scale Label And Style settings 
just as you can in other view-creation dialog boxes. You can also set a fence and cutout 
shape. The Full Boundary and Connection Line options are available only if you’re using 
the Smooth Cutout option. Figure 12.15 shows examples of the Smooth Cutout options.
 
6. Leave the dialog options set at the defaults and then click Front View, approximately in 
the center of the crescent-shaped feature, as shown in Figure 12.15.
 
7. Drag the boundary out to a size close to that shown in Figure 12.15.
 
8. Click the screen where you would like to place the detail view, and the detail is created.
 
9. Click the detail boundary on Front View, and note the six green grips. Click and drag any 
of the outer grips to resize the boundary and use the center one to control the location.
 
10. You can also double-click the two grips near the arrowhead and change the head style.
Here are more options for detail views:
 
◆
Right-click the detail boundary and choose Attach to anchor the detail to a specifi c point 
on the base view.
 
◆
Right-click the detail boundary and choose Options to change the detail from rough to 
smooth, then to add a full detail, and then to add a connection line.
 
◆
Click and drag on the detail label character (the letter A in Figure 12.15) in the boundary 
fence to reposition it.
 
◆
To move the detail label character out away from the boundary, right-click the detail 
boundary, click Leader, and then click the detail label character and drag it; it will be 
attached with a leader.
 
◆
Right-click or double-click the detail view to edit the view and change scale, style, detail 
name, and so on, as you would any other view.
 
◆
When editing a detail view, you click the Edit View Label button (it looks like a pencil). You 
can also use the Type drop-down and select View Label Properties. Then you can use the 
Property drop-down to add the Parent Sheet Name or Index to your view label. This will 
place the parent view information in the view label for detail views. This is often useful 
when the view resides on a different sheet.

Using Detail View Annotation
Although detail views are created at a scale larger than the base view, Inventor takes this into 
account when creating dimensions for the detail view. Th erefore, all your dimensions will be to 
the correct scale.
Creating Break Views
Often when detailing components that are much longer proportionally than they are tall, such 
as frame components, it is a good idea to use the Break tool to remove portions of the model. 
This allows the detail of the end treatments to be the focus of the drawing. Follow these steps to 
explore the Break tool:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_078.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Place Views tab, locate the Break button on the Modify panel and click it.
 
4. Click anywhere on the Front view.
 
5. In the Break dialog box, set the gap to 10 mm.
 
6. Click the view just to the left of where it extends past the drawing border on the left side.
 
7. Drag the break symbol over and click just to the right of where the view extends past the 
drawing border on the right side and then click on-screen.
 
8. Notice that the break is carried through to both views.
 
9. Zoom in on the break symbol and then click it.
 
10. Click and drag the green grip point to the left to reposition it.
 
11. Select the right half of the break symbol and drag it to the right and then let up. This will 
remove more material from the view.
 
12. Select the right half of the break symbol and drag it to the left and then let up. This will 
add more material to the view.
 
13. Adjust the view until it fi ts on the drawing sheet.
 
14. Click the view named Top View and choose Edit View.
 
15. Click the Display Options tab and uncheck the Break check box in the Cut Inheritance 
area. Then click the OK button. You’ll notice that the view no longer inherits the break 
from the parent view (in this case, Front View).
 
16. Click the break symbol on Front View and choose Delete.

CREATING DRAWING VIEWS | 597
 
17. Right-click Sheet 2 in the browser and choose Activate.
 
18. Click the Break button and place the break on the view named Top View.
 
19. Notice the Propagate To Parent View check box. Uncheck this option to break only the 
view named Top View and leave the parent view from which it was created without 
a break.
 
20. Click the start point and endpoint on the view to create the break, and you’ll see that the 
parent view is left as is.
You can continue to experiment with the Break tool and then close this fi le without saving 
changes. Here are some more points to know about break views:
 
◆
To edit an existing break, right-click the break symbol and choose Edit Break.
 
◆
The distance value entered in the Break dialog box refers to the space on the paper between 
the break symbols.
 
◆
You can break views vertically and horizontally using the options in the dialog box, 
but there is not a way to break a view at an angle when a component is not vertical 
or horizontal.
 
◆
There is no “pipe break” symbol for round components.
 
◆
By default, a dimension placed on the view will be broken as well, providing the break 
intersects it.
 
◆
You can slide the dimension break view under the dimension text to hide it on a per-
instance basis.
 
◆
You can edit the dimension style and turn off the dimension break symbol option if you 
like. The setting is on the Display tab of the dimension style settings.
Break Symbols for Structural Detailing
If you detail plate girders and built-up members with vertical stiffeners, gussets, clip plates, 
and so on, you might find that the break symbol on the drawing view causes confusion. To 
break a view without showing the break symbol, you can configure it so that it does not show, 
as described here:
 1. Use the slider bar in the Break dialog box to set the break symbol to the smallest scale (slide it to 
the far left).
 2. Set the break gap to 0.0001 or some number nearing zero (Inventor will not allow a zero value).
 3. Select the break symbol (it will now display as a vertical line) and then switch to the Annotate tab. 
Use the Layer drop-down box to place the break symbol on a nonplotting layer (you will likely need 
to create such a layer in your drawings).
You can try this with the ﬁ le named mi_12a_078.idw; there is a layer called No Plot already cre-
ated in this drawing.

598 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Cropping Views
You can use the Crop tool on the Modify panel of the Place Views panel to crop unneeded areas 
of a drawing view, in much the same way a photograph is cropped. You can specify the crop 
boundary as part of the crop operation or create a sketch on the view fi rst and then use it as the 
crop boundary. When you create a sketch to be used as a crop boundary, you must fi rst select 
the view and then create the sketch, thereby associating the sketch to the view. Unassociated 
sketches cannot be used as a crop boundary.
The following view types cannot be cropped:
 
◆
Views containing a view break
 
◆
Views with overlays
 
◆
Views that have been suppressed
 
◆
Views that have already been cropped
For a quick reference on how to crop views, on the Get Started tab, click the Show Me 
Animations button. On the Show Me Animations screen, select the Drawing–Drawing Views 
link and then click the Crop View Animation link on the resulting screen.
Using Draft Views
Draft views are essentially just 2D sketches created in a drawing and packaged in a view “con-
tainer,” allowing them to be scaled and handled like other drawing views. For instance, if you 
have standard details drawn in AutoCAD, you might copy them into a draft view and then 
place and scale them as needed.
To create standard details from Inventor views, you can use Save Copy As to create an 
AutoCAD DWG fi le and then paste the detail back into Inventor as a draft view. However, draft 
views have limited capabilities for sharing between drawings, so you might consider sketched 
symbols for standard details you plan to use over and over.
To create a draft view, follow these general steps:
 
1. From the Place Views tab, click the Draft button on the Create panel.
 
2. In the Draft View dialog box, set the label and scale and then click the Label Visibility 
button (it looks like a lightbulb) to display the view name and scale on the drawing.
 
3. Click the OK button to close the Draft View dialog box.
 
4. An empty view and sketch are created. Use the sketch tools to add geometry, text, and 
dimensions as needed, or paste in copied geometry from AutoCAD.
 
5. Click the Finish Sketch button to create the sketch and draft view.
Creating Overlay Views
You can create overlay views to show positional representations overlaid on top of one another, 
thereby communicating the change in position between the positional representations. This 
allows you to effectively show an assembly motion of multiple positions using a single view. To 

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 599
create an overlay view, the assembly must fi rst have positional representations set up to be used. 
Follow these steps to explore overlay views:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_080.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Place Views tab, click the Overlay button and select the existing view on the sheet.
 
4. In the Overlay View dialog box, choose Closed from the Positional Representation drop-
down and then click the OK button.
The result is a view of the alternative position shown in a phantom linetype overlaid on the 
original. You can dimension to the overlay lines as you would any others to capture a mecha-
nism’s extension length, rotation angle, and so on. The key to overlay views is in setting up the 
positional representations in the assembly beforehand.
When you create the overlay, you are given the opportunity to specify a view representation 
for the overlay view. It’s recommended that before you create an overlay view, you create a view 
representation that visibly isolates only the components that move as a result of the positional rep-
resentation. Otherwise (as is the case in this example), all the nonmoving components are redrawn 
over the same components in the base view.
To change positional representations used in an overlay view, delete the existing overlay 
view and specify a different positional representation when placing a new overlay view. Also, 
be aware that because weldments are not allowed to use positional representations, overlays are 
not allowed for weldment drawing and will be removed if they exist when an assembly is con-
verted to a weldment.
You can close the fi le without saving changes.
View Representations and Positional Representations
It’s often helpful to create a view representation in your assembly and turn oﬀ  the visibility for all 
of the parts that are not moving. Th en you can use this view representation in your overlay view 
for added clarity.
Annotating Part Drawings
Once you’ve created the appropriate views to document the model, you can add annotations. 
You can fi nd the annotation tools on the Annotate tab. The Annotate tab is divided into several 
groups of tools, including Dimension, Feature Notes, Text, Symbols, Sketch, Table, and Format 
tools. The following sections explore the annotation tools.
Using Centerline and Center Marks
There are four standard centerline and center mark tools as well as an automated centerline 
tool. These tools are called Centerline, Centerline Bisector, Center Mark, and Centered Pattern, 

600 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
and you can access them from the Symbols panel of the Annotate tab (look for the four buttons 
next to the Create Sketch button). Recall that hovering your mouse pointer over a tool button 
provides a tool tip with the button name and that hovering a moment longer displays a dynamic 
tool tip showing an illustrated example of the tool. The automated centerline tool is accessed dif-
ferently than the other centerline and center mark tools, as explained in the coming pages.
Centerline
Use Centerline to draw a centerline-style line, arc, or circle by specifying points. When center-
line arcs are created using circles or arcs as the selection points, a center mark is drawn on the 
arc along with the centerline:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_082.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Annotate tab, select the Centerline tool.
 
4. On VIEW 1, click the hole at the 12 o’clock position and then the hole at 2 o’clock. Notice 
that the tool is drawing a straight line at this point.
 
5. Click the hole at 4 o’clock and notice that the centerline becomes an arc.
 
6. Continue around, clicking each hole, and then close the centerline by clicking 12 o’clock 
once again; then right-click and choose Create. Your centerline should resemble the one 
on the left of Figure 12.16.
 
7. You should still be in the Centerline tool at this point. On VIEW 4, click the center of hole 
A1, then B1, then B2, and fi nally A4.
 
8. Right-click and choose Create; then right-click and choose Cancel. Your centerline should 
resemble the one on the right of Figure 12.16.
As you can see, the Centerline tool will triangulate the fi rst three points and attempt to 
establish a centered pattern. In this way, you can use it to draw centerline arcs, circles, and lines. 
However, if you just need to draw a series of lines, this functionality can get in the way.
To draw just centerlines, click the fi rst two points and then click any blank space on the sheet; 
then click the next two points and click a blank area again, and so on. The blank clicks are the 
same as right-clicking and choosing Create. Try this on VIEW 5 to draw centerlines between 
each of the corner holes.
Figure 12.16
Centerlines

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 601
Watch Your Mouse Clicks During Centerline Creation
Th e Centerline tool is a bit speciﬁ c in the order it wants to see mouse clicks. After you have selected 
the ﬁ nal features on which to place the center mark, right-click and select Create. If you do not 
select Create and continue to select the next hole, you might end up with undesirable results. It 
takes a little getting used to, but you’ll ﬁ gure it out.
Centerline Bisector
Use Centerline Bisector to create a centerline halfway between two edges or two points. Note 
that the edges do not have to be parallel or the same length. You can even select two circles, and 
you will get a centerline halfway between them:
 
1. Still in mi_12a_082.idw, select the Centerline Bisector tool on the Annotate tab.
 
2. Zoom in on the center shaft area of view Section A-A.
 
3. Click the top and bottom lines on the shaft to create a centerline running down the middle of 
the section view. Notice that the distance between the two lines is bisected with a centerline.
 
4. Place bisector centerlines in two holes in Section A-A by clicking the opposing lines for each.
 
5. Right-click and choose Cancel.
 
6. Click the centerline you placed in the center shaft and drag out the left end so it extends 
past the shaft. Bisector centerlines are created based on the size of the lines you choose 
and may need to be adjusted. Your section view should resemble Figure 12.17.
Center Mark
Use the Center Mark tool to annotate hole centers, circular edges, cylindrical geometry, and arcs 
such as fi lleted corners. Center marks, as well as centerlines, are primarily formatted by the 
Center Mark style, but there is a distinct difference between how ANSI and non-ANSI center 
marks are drawn, so be sure your active standard is set properly for your needs. Follow these 
steps to explore the Center Mark tool:
 
1. Continuing with mi_12a_082.idw, select the Center Mark tool on the Annotate tab.
 
2. Zoom in to VIEW 2.
 
3. Click the edge or the centers of each hole.
Figure 12.17
Bisecting centerlines
SECTION A-A

602 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
 
4. Click the outermost circle as well.
 
5. Right-click and choose the OK button (or Cancel).
 
6. Select the large center mark you just created and then click the Style drop-down box (on 
the Format panel of the Annotate tab).
 
7. Select the style called Center Mark (ISO) from the list to set the existing center mark to 
the ISO style. You’ll notice the change in style.
Here are some Center Mark tool options to be aware of:
 
◆
For large center marks that are mostly solid lines, you can right-click them, choose Edit ➢ 
Add/Remove Dashes, and then click the lines to place the dashes. Do the same to remove 
extra dashes once they are placed.
 
◆
Once extra dashes have been added, click them to slide them into place.
 
◆
To lock down extra dashes, right-click and choose Edit ➢ Uniform Spacing.
 
◆
You can align center marks with an angled edge by right-clicking them, choosing Edit ➢ 
Align To Edge, and then selecting a diagonal edge in the view.
 
◆
You can adjust center mark overshoots by clicking the ends and dragging in or out as required.
 
◆
To reset overshoots, right-click the center mark and choose Edit ➢ Fit Center Mark.
 
◆
To simplify center marks to just a center cross, right-click them and choose Edit ➢ Extension 
Lines.
 
◆
You can right-click a center mark and choose Edit Center Mark Style to adjust the way cen-
ter marks are drawn by default.
Centered Pattern
Use Centered Pattern to create a centerline on parts or features that have a consistent pattern. If 
the pattern is circular, a center mark is automatically placed:
 
1. Continuing with mi_12a_082.idw, select the Centered Pattern tool on the Annotate tab.
 
2. Zoom in to VIEW 3.
 
3. Click the center hole fi rst to establish the pattern axis.
 
4. Click all the holes in the pattern and click the starting hole again to close the pattern.
 
5. Right-click and choose Create and then right-click and choose Cancel.
There are many options for creating centerlines and center marks manually, but in the next 
section you’ll create them in a more automatic fashion. You can close the current fi le without 
saving changes and continue.
Automated Centerlines
Rather than placing centerlines and center marks manually, you can use the Automated 
Centerlines tool. This tool is in the context menu of each view, and you can run it on multiple 
views on the same sheet at one time (multiselect views while holding your Ctrl key down before 
executing the tool). Follow these steps to explore the Automated Centerlines tool:

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 603
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_084.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Hold the Ctrl key and select all four views.
 
4. Right-click and choose Automated Centerlines. If you do not see this option in the context 
menu, you have most likely selected something other than a view (such as a line or hatch 
pattern).
 
5. In the Automated Centerlines dialog box, use the Apply To buttons to select the type of 
objects to which you want to apply center marks and centerlines. In this case, choose all 
of the following:
 
◆
Hole features
 
◆
Cylindrical features
 
◆
Revolved features
 
◆
Circular patterned features
 
6. In the Projection area, ensure that both the Axis Normal and Axis Parallel projection but-
tons are selected; otherwise, the sections’ views will be ignored.
 
7. In the Radius Threshold area, enter 3 in the Maximum box for Circular Edges. This will 
ensure that no center mark is placed for the outer edge of the revolved part or for the 3.94 
radius circle in the hub.
 
8. Click the OK button and notice the centerlines and marks that have been created.
You can set the defaults for automated centerlines by selecting the Tools tab, clicking 
Document Settings, and selecting the Drawing tab in the dialog box that appears. Do this in 
your template, and you will not have to go through the process of selecting the Apply To buttons 
or specifying minimum and maximum threshold values each time.
Use the Undo button to reset the drawing and then experiment with the options to gain more 
understanding of the different features. When you have fi nished, you can close the fi le without 
saving changes.
Creating Dimensions
A signifi cant portion of any detailing job is placing and modifying dimensions; therefore, it is 
important to become familiar with the various dimension tools and formatting options available 
in the Drawing Manager. Here is a quick reference of the dimension types available:
 
◆
Linear dimension from one element. For instance, select a line and drag and drop the 
dimension.

◆
Apply General, Ordinate, and Baseline dimensions to spline endpoints.
 
◆
Apply General and Ordinate dimensions to the X and Y Min/Max points of a spline.
Most of these dimensions can be created with just one tool, the General Dimension tool.
General Dimensions
You can fi nd the General Dimension tool by clicking the Dimension button on the Annotate tab. 
This will be your primary dimensioning tool. It works very much like the Sketch Dimension 
tool discussed earlier in this book in that this single tool can generate several different types of 
dimensions depending on the geometry you select.
Once geometry is selected, you can right-click to choose the applicable options for placing 
the type of geometry you’ve selected. You can also control snap options, arrowhead options, and 
leader options specifi c to each dimension type from the context menu.
A few more types of dimensions are available in drawings than can be generated in sketches 
using the General Dimension tool. For instance, once an arc is selected (not a full circle), a 
radius dimension is created by default, but prior to placement, you can right-click and choose 
Diameter, Angular, Angular Foreshortened Arc Length, Arc Length Foreshortened, or Chord 
Length from the Dimension Type fl yout, as shown in Figure 12.18.
Prior to placing a linear dimension between two points or two parallel lines, you can 
create Linear Diameter, Linear Symmetric, or Linear Foreshortened dimensions by choos-
ing from the dimension’s context Dimension Type fl yout. These types of dimensions are

used commonly with symmetrical parts, especially turned cylindrical parts. Figure 12.19 
shows the Linear dimension options available when two points or two parallel lines have 
been selected.
Prior to placing diameter dimensions, you can right-click and switch to a radius or change 
the leader options, as shown in Figure 12.20.
Dimension Filters
You can create and access selection fi lters by holding your Shift key down and right-clicking or 
by clicking the selection drop-down from the Quick Access bar at the top of the screen. Selection 
fi lters specify the elements that can be selected when working in a drawing. For instance, if 
you choose the Detail selection fi lter, only objects common to detailing tasks are selectable, and 
items such as view boundaries, view labels, section view lines, and so on, are fi ltered out and 
cannot be selected. If you choose Select All Inventor Dimensions, you can quickly select all of 
the drawing dimensions and then use the Style drop-down menu to change them all to a differ-
ent dimension style. You can create a custom fi lter also by Shift+right-clicking and choosing Edit 
Select Filters.
Recovering Model Dimensions
Another way to quickly add dimensions to your model views is to use the Retrieve Dimensions 
tool. You can access this tool from the view’s context menu or from the Annotate tab. This tool 
Figure 12.19

options

608 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
allows you to recover sketch and feature dimensions that were used to model your part and 
bring them into the drawing view. To recover model dimensions, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Annotate tab, click the Retrieve button.
 
2. Select the view you want to retrieve dimensions for.
 
3. You can choose to retrieve dimensions per feature or per part, depending on what makes 
sense. You might choose per part when working with an assembly view, for instance. Set 
the radio button as you require.
 
4. Select the features or parts in the graphics window. You can select multiple objects by 
holding down the Shift or Ctrl key as you select them. Or you can window-select the 
whole view.
 
5. When selected, the part or feature will display all of the dimensions normal to the view. 
Click the Select Dimensions button to choose which dimensions to keep. Again, you can 
use a window selection to select them all.
 
6. Click the Apply button and then select another view to retrieve or click the OK button.
Be Warned About Model Dimensions
You should be aware that there are often dimensions required to model features that are not 
necessarily required or desired for use on a drawing. For example, if you were to recover model 
dimensions for View 7 in the ﬁ le mi_12a_084.idw, you would see that the pocket is dimensioned 
from one end of the part and the holes are dimensioned from the other end. Not only is this poor 
practice, since it requires the machinist to rezero the mill, but it can also cause a tolerance stack-up.
Recovered model dimensions behave similarly to regular, placed dimensions with respect 
to editing and formatting. Recovered model dimensions cannot be detached or reattached from 
the geometry they’re referencing.
Model dimension values can be directly edited from the drawing view, thus changing 
the model parameter value and affecting the size and shape of your model feature. Access the 
dimension value by selecting Edit Model Dimension from the dimension’s context menu.
The ability to change model dimension values is set during Inventor installation; the default 
setting is to have the ability enabled. If you would prefer that users can retrieve model dimen-
sions but not be allowed to edit them from the drawing, go through the installation confi guration 
settings to disable this.
Exercise Caution When Editing Model Dimensions
Th e option to enable edits of model dimension values from the drawing can be powerful and dan-
gerous. Editing a model dimension from a drawing is a quick way to edit the size and shape of a 
model, but it is often blind to other issues it may create. For example, if a part is used in an assembly 
and another part references holes adaptively in that assembly, changing the model dimension may 
aﬀ ect this second part without your knowledge. It is suggested that you always open the assembly 
to see what else your changes will aﬀ ect.

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 609
Once a particular model dimension is recovered in one view, it cannot be recovered again 
in any other view in the same fi le. You can move recovered model dimensions between views, 
however, provided appropriate attachment points exist in the target view. To do this, right-click 
the dimension and choose Move Dimension.
Baseline Dimensions and Baseline Dimension Sets
Baseline dimensions are a series of linear dimensions that terminate at a common point (or base-
line). The Baseline Dimension and Baseline Dimension Set tools offer a mechanism to quickly 
add dimensions to a drawing view in an orderly way.
When you execute the Baseline Dimension tool, you’re left with a series of conventional lin-
ear dimensions. This tool simply automates what you could do on your own with the General 
Dimension tool. The Baseline Dimension Set tool, however, generates a collected group of linear 
dimensions that are edited and moved (through dragging and editing) as a single group.
To understand this more fully, open the fi le mi_12a_085.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and compare the two dimensioned views. The one on 
the left was done with the Baseline Dimension tool, and the one on the right was done with the 
Baseline Dimension Set tool.
Use the views on the bottom to create baseline dimensions. Start either tool, click the left 
vertical part edge (this will be the baseline), and then manually select or multiselect additional 
features (these can be model edges or hole centers). When you’ve selected all the geometry you 
want to dimension, right-click and click to place the dimensions (shown in Figure 12.21). After 
you place the dimensions, you can continue to select points on the view (points on geometry 
rather than explicit geometry), or you can right-click and select Create.
Once a baseline set is created, you can right-click any of the dimensions and choose from the 
options to add a member, delete a member, detach a member, and arrange the entire set. You can 
also choose Make Origin to reset the base of the set. You can fi nd the Baseline Dimension Set 
tool by clicking the small arrow next to the Baseline Dimension tool to reveal the drop-down list.

Chain Dimensions and Chain Dimension Sets
Chain dimensions and chain dimension sets enable you to quickly select objects and then 
place a chain of dimensions from point to point along the selected direction. To understand 
chain dimensions more fully, open the fi le mi_12a_092.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and compare the two dimensioned views. The one on the top 
left was done with the Chain Dimension tool, and the one on the top right was done with the 
Chain Dimension Set tool.
Use the view on the bottom left to create chain dimensions:
 
1. From the Dimension panel of the Annotate tab, select Chain.
 
2. On the drawing, select the geometry to be dimensioned by clicking to select 
 individual edges or by clicking and dragging a window from right to left to select 
multiple edges.
 
3. Right-click and select Continue.
 
4. Move your cursor to preview the placement and then click to set the direction.
 
5. When fi nished, right-click and select Create.
Use the Chain Dimension tool to select the baseline dimensions in the bottom-center view to 
convert them to chain dimensions:
 
1. From the Dimension panel of the Annotate tab, select Chain.
 
2. On the drawing, select all of the baseline dimensions by clicking and dragging a window 
from right to left.
 
3. Right-click and select Continue.
 
4. Select the center marks for the two smaller holes to add additional dimensions.
 
5. Right-click and select Create.
Note that there appears to be a bit of a bug in the way the dimensions are arranged. To 
remedy this, use the Arrange button, as described here.
 
6. From the Dimension panel of the Annotate tab, select Arrange.
 
7. On the drawing, select all of the chain dimensions you just created by clicking and drag-
ging a window from right to left.
 
8. Right-click and choose Contour Entity.
 
9. Select the edge of the part (or optionally click anywhere to the right of the part).
Use the view on the bottom right to create a chain dimension set:
 
1. From the Dimension panel of the Annotate tab, select Chain Set from the Chain drop-
down list.
 
2. On the drawing, select just the top and bottom edge of the part and any one of the holes.
 
3. Right-click and select Continue.
 
4. Move your cursor to preview the placement and then click to set the direction.
 
5. Select an additional hole to add to the set.
 
6. Right-click and select Create.

7. Add more members to the set by right-clicking the set and choosing Add Member.
 
8. Select all of the geometry needed to complete the set so that it matches the top right view 
and then right-click and choose Done.
 
9. Right-click any of the dimensions in the set and choose Delete Member.
Once you’ve experimented with the chain dimension options, you can close the fi le without 
saving changes.
Ordinate Dimensions and Ordinate Dimension Sets
Ordinate dimensions and ordinate dimension sets are created much the same way as baseline 
and chain dimensions and dimension sets. Again, a dimension set is managed and formatted as 
a single, selectable object (with some exceptions), whereas the Ordinate Dimension tool results 
in independently controlled dimensions.
Another key difference between ordinate dimensions and an ordinate dimension set is that 
you can have multiple ordinate sets on a single view with different origin points. However, 
once you specify an origin for ordinate dimensions on a view, all ordinate dimensions placed 
on that view will reference that origin as well as any hole tables referencing that view. The 
reverse is true as well: Once an origin is specifi ed for a hole table, ordinate dimensions on that 
view share the origin.
Changing Origins
You can set the origin for an ordinate dimension set after you have selected the geometry. Th e 
default origin is the ﬁ rst selected geometry, but you can change it. Th is is very powerful for updat-
ing a drawing. For ordinate dimensions, you can click the origin indicator and drag it to a diﬀ erent 
endpoint, midpoint, or center point to change the geometry reference. You can also hide the origin 
indicator by right-clicking it and then show it again by right-clicking any of the origin dimensions.
To understand this more fully, open the fi le mi_12a_099.idw in the Chapter 12 directory 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and compare the two dimensioned views. The one 
on the left was done with the Ordinate Dimension tool, and the one on the right was done with 
the Ordinate Dimension Set tool. Use the views on the bottom to create ordinate dimensions 
and ordinate dimensions sets matching the views at the top. Once they are created, explore 
the context menu options for the dimensions and the dimension set. You can fi nd the Ordinate 
Dimension Set tool by clicking the small arrow next to the Ordinate Dimension tool to reveal 
the drop-down list.
Dimensions in Isometric Views
Although you may have been taught at some point that dimensions should never be placed on 
isometric views because traditional detailing techniques do not allow an accurate dimension 
to be pulled from an isometric, Inventor can overcome this by pulling the intelligence from the 
physical model. When you use the General Dimension tool to add dimensions to an isometric 
view, the resulting dimensions are fundamentally different from those you place in ortho-
graphic views.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

612 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
This is immediately noticeable when you see how the resulting dimensions are drawn on the 
sheet: All of the dimension geometries (text, arrowheads, extension lines, and dimension lines) 
are drawn in 3D space and not in sheet space. Dimensions generated on isometric views are 
called true (meaning they refl ect the true model-space dimensional value). Dimensions added 
to orthographic views are known as projected because the dimension value represents the calcu-
lated distance or angle between endpoints or geometry projected onto the sheet.
When placing an isometric dimension, Inventor tries to determine an appropriate annotation 
plane based on your geometry selection. In many cases, particularly with linear dimensions, 
multiple inferred annotation planes are available. Prior to placing the dimension, you can toggle 
through these inferred annotation planes by pressing the spacebar.
If none of the inferred work planes meets your needs, you can project the dimension either onto 
the sheet plane or onto a model work plane. For instance, oftentimes you will fi nd that hole notes 
and leader dimensions such as radii and diameters look better placed on the sheet plane rather than 
in the isometric plane; therefore, you can right-click and choose Use Sheet Plane when placing them.
The change in dimension behavior (true vs. projected) happens automatically depending on the 
view orientation. Any projected isometric or base isometric view results in true dimensions. As a 
rule, newly added dimensions to a view are treated as true if none of the model’s origin planes is 
parallel to the sheet (with the exception of auxiliary views). You can override this rule on a view-
by-view basis by right-clicking a view and changing the dimension type (true or projected).
Retrieve Dimensions from Isometric Views
A quick way to place dimensions on an isometric view is to right-click the view and choose Retrieve 
Dimensions.
Isometric dimensions are functionally identical to orthographic dimensions; however, they 
cannot be “moved.” That is, they cannot be detached and reattached to different geometry, and 
they can’t be moved using the dimension Move option on the dimension’s context menu. All for-
matting options and behavior are otherwise identical.
Although placing isometric dimensions may seem unconventional, you can, in fact, often 
eliminate the number of views required to concisely communicate the design by placing dimen-
sions on an isometric view. Try adding dimensions to the isometric view in mi_12a_105.idw, as 
shown in Figure 12.22.
Formatting and Editing Dimensions
All the different types of dimensions discussed in this section are initially formatted by an 
associative dimension style. Indeed, each different type of dimension can be set to use a differ-
ent dimension style if needed. Almost every formatting option available for dimensions is set 
through the dimension style. There are dozens of individual style settings—too many to list 
here. To learn how to change dimension formatting through styles, you’ll walk through setting 
up a new dimension style to apply a symmetrical tolerance:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_107.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.

3. On the Manage tab, click the Styles Editor button.
 
4. In the Style And Standard Editor, expand the Dimension node on the left side and click 
the Default–mm (ANSI) dimension style.
 
5. Click the New button along the top, thus creating a new style based on the Default–mm 
(ANSI) style. You can also right-click the dimension style you want to start from and 
choose New Style.
 
6. Enter PM1 for the dimension name and click the OK button.
 
7. Click the Tolerance tab and set the Method drop-down to Symmetric.
 
8. Enter 0.100 for the Upper value fi eld and then set Linear Precision to three places, as 
shown in Figure 12.23.
 
9. Select the Units tab and change the Linear Precision setting to three places (3.123).
 
10. Click the Save button along the top and close the Style And Standard Editor 
dialog box.
 
11. Apply this dimension style to the existing dimensions on the sheet by fi rst selecting them 
and then selecting the Annotate tab and choosing PM1 from the Style drop-down (found 
just under the Layer drop-down to the top right of the screen). The selected dimensions 
will immediately update to refl ect the new style assignment.

Creating Dimension Styles
It is a good idea to create all your standard dimension styles before rolling out your style library. 
By creating standards for all users to use, you eliminate any discrepancy that comes from mul-
tiple users all trying to create drawings that look the same. You can create all your decimal-place 
dimensions (one place, two place, three place, and so on), toleranced dimensions, and even dowel-
pinhole-toleranced dimension styles that users need only select.
 
12. Double-click the 25 mm dimension to edit it and click the Precision And Tolerance tab. 
The ±0.100 tolerance setting is refl ected here in the Edit dialog box. Change the tolerance 
value to ±0.200 and then click the OK button.
You’ve now created two formatting overrides for the 25 mm dimension. You have over-
ridden the standard dimension style assignment by setting it to a dimension style other 
than the By Standard style, and you then set a tolerance override. In addition to making 
style-level formatting changes to dimensions, you can copy and paste dimension format-
ting between dimension objects on your sheet.
 
13. Right-click the 25 mm dimension you just edited and select Copy Properties.
 
14. Click the 30 mm dimension. It will adopt both the style formatting and the local tolerance 
value override from your source dimension.
You can confi gure which properties are copied before selecting the target dimension by right-
clicking and selecting Settings after invoking the Copy Properties tool. To edit a dimension’s style, 
right-click the object and choose Edit Dimension Style, which will take you right into the Style 
Editor and highlight the dimension style. You can do this with just about any annotation object.
Hole and Th read Notes
A hole note differs from a traditional diameter dimension by calling out feature information 
beyond just the hole diameter. The Hole/Thread Notes command (in the Feature Notes panel) 
Figure 12.23
Dimension style toler-
ance settings

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 615
generates a leadered note that displays all pertinent hole feature information derived from the 
hole edge that is selected.
For example, a hole note pointing to a simple blind hole might appear as 10 × 20. A hole note 
pointing to a through partial-tapped hole might appear as 10–32 UNF-2B × 20.00. Inventor provides 
you with the ability to tailor the exact contents of the hole note through your dimension style.
Use the Hole/Thread Notes tool to add a single note for the mounting hole and tapped hole 
in the faceplate front view. You can confi gure hole notes to display whatever string of descrip-
tion text you prefer, as well as set the various hole parameter values’ Precision and Tolerance 
settings. These preferences are set and stored in the dimension style.
You can confi gure more than 50 types of holes in this interface; they generally correspond to 
the different kinds of holes you can create using the Hole feature tool in part and assembly mod-
eling (“holes” as a result of circular-extruded cuts, voids, or circular sheet-metal cut features are 
also supported by hole notes).
You can confi gure hole notes to display the hole quantity as part of the note. You can add a 
quantity note either directly on an individual note through the Edit Hole Note dialog box (right-
click a hole note and choose Edit Hole Note) or at the style level (right-click a hole note and 
choose Edit Dimension style) so they appear for all holes of the same type. You can use the hole 
note in mi_12a_109.idw to explore this.
To add a quantity note at the style level, make sure you’re editing the dimension style associated 
with the hole notes on your drawing (the best way to ensure this is to right-click the hole note and 
choose Edit Dimension Style). Select Blind - Depth Thread in the Note Format drop-down and then 
click in the text fi eld so that the cursor is in front of the note text; fi nally, click the button with the # 
sign on it. This inserts the <QTYNOTE> variable token in front of the note, as shown in Figure 12.24.
You can customize the quantity note by clicking the Edit Quantity Note button on the dimen-
sion style’s Notes And Leaders tab, as shown at the bottom left of Figure 12.24. By default, the 
quantity note is set up as a prefi x to the full hole note (2 ×). This dialog box also lets you set how 
the hole quantity is determined (either the number of holes in a feature or pattern or a complete 
evaluation of identical holes in a view where all the hole axes are normal to the view).
As soon as you save the changes to your dimension style, you should see the hole note for the 
tapped holes update to include the quantity of holes (2 ×).
Figure 12.24
Hole note settings in 
dimension style

616 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
The dimension style’s Notes And Leaders tab also enables you to preconfi gure other kinds 
of feature notes, including chamfer notes (which are actually calculated notes and not feature-
dependent), punch notes, and bend notes (the latter two of which are available only for views of 
sheet-metal parts).
Leadered Symbols
Many of the annotations you can apply to a drawing belong to a common class of annotations 
often referred to as leadered symbols. These are all grouped together in the Drawing Annotation 
panel: Surface Texture Symbol, Welding Symbol, Feature Control Frame, Feature ID Symbol, 
Datum ID Symbol, and fi ve different Datum Target tools. Each of these is created the same way, 
and each is formatted with its own dedicated style.
In the following steps, you will walk through an exercise that involves adding geometric 
dimensioning and tolerancing symbols to a drawing of a faceplate:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_109.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Annotate tab, use the drop-down on the Symbols panel and click the Datum 
Identifi er Symbol button.
 
4. Click the far-right edge of the part and drag the leader to the desired length.
 
5. Click the screen to set the leader and then right-click and choose Continue.
 
6. Accept the default A value in the text editor and click the OK button.
 
7. Click the bottom edge to add a second datum ID (B), but rather than placing a leader, 
right-click and choose Continue immediately after clicking the initial part edge point. 
You can do this with most Inventor leader features.
 
8. On the Annotate tab, use the drop-down on the Symbols panel and choose the Feature 
Control Frame button.
 
9. Rather than attaching the frame to the part, hover your mouse pointer near the bottom 
middle of the hole note until you see a green dot indicating the snap point (just below the 
N in UNF) and then click it.
 
10. Right-click and choose Continue to place the frame without a leader. This will attach the 
frame to the dimension text.
 
11. Fill out the appropriate fi elds for a positional tolerance relative to the A datum and the 
B datum, as shown in Figure 12.25; then click the OK button.
 
12. To see that the frame is attached, select the hole note and then drag the leader landing to 
move the note. Notice how the frame remains constrained to the hole note.
Drawing Text
You can add text to your drawing in multiple ways. The Text tool (on the Annotate tab) is 
used to create general drawing notes. This kind of text is limited because it can’t be associated 

ANNOTATING PART DRAWINGS | 617
(constrained) to a drawing view and because it offers no control over which component iProp-
erties and parameters are being accessed when you have multiple components detailed on the 
same sheet.
In addition to using the Text tool, you can use the Leader Text tool (also on the Annotate tab), 
which can be associated to a view or a component, allowing you to extract and display iProperty 
and model parameter values from the component to which the leader is attached. If view asso-
ciativity is required but you don’t want a leader, you can right-click the leader text and choose 
Delete Leader.
Each of these tools utilizes the generic Format Text dialog box. This dialog box is used to edit 
any text-specifi c annotations as well as annotations such as hole tags and datum and feature 
IDs. The general text formatting for any drawing annotation containing text ultimately comes 
from a text style. Text style formatting (size, font, color, and so on) can be overwritten in the 
Format Text dialog box.
General Tables
You can create a table on a drawing sheet by using the General Table tool on the Annotate tab (the 
button is located on the Table panel and is called General). When you click the General button, 
you are presented with the Table dialog. You can create an empty table and then add information, 
or you can choose a data source from which to populate the table:
iParts and iAssemblies  These can be used to create tabulated confi guration tables. For 
instance, you might have an iPart bracket in six different lengths. You could select the iPart 
fi le to use as the table data source and then place a table with a row for each of the six lengths 
listed by their part numbers. You would choose the Length parameter to use as the column, 
and each row would be populated with the appropriate length value, as defi ned in the iPart. 
You can then place a view of one of the brackets and edit the dimension to read Length rather 
than the numeric value.
Sheet-Metal Parts  These parts can be used to create bend tables. Selecting an existing fl at 
pattern view as the data source allows you to choose the parameters you want to use in the 
bend table and then place a table indexing the bends on the fl at pattern. Bend ID numbers are 
automatically placed on the fl at pattern view. Editing the bend ID in the table updates the ID 
number on the fl at pattern. Editing the table overrides the bend order annotation of the part 
fi le; therefore, it is typically best to use the Bend Order Annotation tool in the sheet-metal 
part to set the order.
Figure 12.25
Feature control frame

618 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
XLS Files  You can link an Excel spreadsheet fi le to a general table. Use the General 
Table tool and select the XLS fi le to place the table on the drawing sheet and link to the 
original fi le.
 
◆
To update the table, right-click it in the browser and choose Edit to open the XLS fi le. 
If the XLS fi le is linked, you can edit it outside of Inventor and right-click to choose 
Update to bring in the changes.
 
◆
To point the table to a different XLS fi le, expand the 3rd Party folder, right-click the 
table link, and choose Change Source. Be aware that there are limitations to the num-
ber of rows you can have using this method. Also note that blank rows in the XLS fi le 
will be read as the end of the table.
Splitting Tables
If your table has a large number of rows, it might be too long to ﬁ t on the drawing sheet. In these 
cases you can split the table. To do so, click the row where you want to split the table and then 
right-click and choose Table ➢ Split Table. You can split a table into multiple sections by using the 
Split Table option on a previously split table. Be sure to select the table row and not the table line 
before you right-click; otherwise, the Split Table option will be grayed out.
Once the table is split, you can drag the sections into place on the sheet as needed. In the browser 
you’ll see the split section nested under the original table node. You can move the split table to 
another sheet by clicking and dragging on it in the browser and dropping it on the browser node 
of another sheet. To rejoin the table, you can right-click the browser node or the actual table and 
choose Table ➢ Un-split Table. Changes to the original table section are applied to all split sections; 
however, changes applied to a split section are applied to it alone.
You can use the Split Table option on general tables, parts list tables, revision tables, and 
hole tables.
Hole Tables
You can document hole descriptions, quantities, and locations on a view by using a hole table 
rather than using hole notes. Indeed, you can use the hole table to document not only hole 
features but sheet-metal punches as well. You can even use a hole table to call out locations of 
recovered work points in your model. This technique can be used to detail specialized features 
such as slots and bosses.
Hole tables, like most types of annotation in Inventor, are initially formatted by an asso-
ciative style—a Hole Table style in this case. The Hole Table style enables you to select which 
columns you want displayed in your table, format precision and units for the X and Y location 
columns, change line formatting, fi lter on different hole types, and confi gure various grouping 
mechanisms depending on your needs.
Everything about the hole table is formatted by the Hole Table style except for the description 
string for the hole. The description string uses the same confi guration as your hole notes and 
receives this particular formatting by the hole tag’s dimension style (hole tags are created with 
the hole table and are formatted by a dimension style).

In the following steps, you’ll walk through setting up a Hole Table style and creating a hole 
table for the faceplate:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_111.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Manage tab, click the Styles Editor button.
 
4. In the left pane of the Styles Editor, expand the hole table node, and click the style named 
Hole Table–mm (ANSI). The right pane will update to show the settings for this style, as 
shown in Figure 12.26.
 
5. At the top of the right pane, click the New button and set the name of the new hole table 
style to HT_02.
 
6. Click the Column Chooser button and select the Quantity property on the left of the 
resulting property list.
 
7. Click the Add button to add it to the included list of columns on the right.
 
8. Use the Move Up button to move the Quantity column up in the list as you like; then click 
the OK button.
 
9. Right-click the XDIM property in the Default Column Settings frame and select Format 
Column.
 
10. In the Format Column dialog box, change the precision to three places and change the 
column heading to X LOCATION. Note that you can format columns in this manner in 
almost all of the annotation tables, such as parts lists, and so on.

11. Click the OK button and repeat for the YDIM column.
 
12. Click the Save button to save the changes and exit the Style And Standard Editor dialog 
box by clicking the Done button.
You will now need to place a hole table on the drawing. Three hole table variations are avail-
able on the Table panel of the Annotate tab:
Selection  This option allows you to select the holes you want to include in the table, and 
then only those holes are included.
View  This option documents all holes in a view, although you can use fi lters to exclude cer-
tain hole types. As holes are added to the part, the hole table updates to include them.
Features  This option allows you to select an instance of the types of holes you want to 
include in the table, and then all holes of that type are included.
To continue this exercise, you’ll choose to place a hole table using the View method:
 
1. On the Annotate tab, select the Hole drop-down on the Table panel and choose 
Hole View.
 
2. Select the view on the sheet.
 
3. Next, you need to place the origin on the view. You can click any edge or vertex of 
the part, or you can project the edges to fi nd the apparent intersection of the 
lower-left corner.
 
4. To place a table using the table style you created, choose HT_02 from the Style drop-down 
at the top right of the screen.
Finding a Corner Intersection
To find an apparent intersection for placement of an origin marker, zoom into the lower-
left corner of the part. Th en scrub your mouse pointer over the vertical and horizontal edges 
of the part and bring it to the apparent intersection; you should see the edge projected down 
and over and see a yellow dot at the intersection. When you do, click the dot to set the origin at that 
point. Be sure you run over the edges (lines) and not just the endpoints of the edges.
 
5. Click the screen to set the hole table on the sheet.
For each hole in the view, a hole tag is placed next to the hole edge, and a corresponding 
row is generated in the hole table. Also notice that because each hole is called out individu-
ally in this table, each row has a quantity of 1 (shown in Figure 12.27). You can edit the hole 
table by right-clicking it and choosing Edit Hole Table. From there, you can set the table to 
roll up all A-type holes and all B-type holes from the Options tab by selecting the Rollup 
radio button.
You can also edit the Tag, Note, or Description text by right-clicking the text in the table. 
You can make direct overrides to hole descriptions by double-clicking the description text, and 
you can override X and Y location precision by right-clicking an individual cell. You can access 

ANNOTATING ASSEMBLY DRAWINGS | 621
several other options by right-clicking the text in the table as well, so be certain to explore them 
all. When fi nished, you can close the fi le without saving changes.
Hole Tables Save Time on Large Parts
For large plates with many diﬀ erent holes, hole tables are wonderful. A large plate could take a half 
hour or more to fully dimension. Furthermore, it’s often diﬃ  cult for a machinist to tell where all 
ﬁ ve of the same holes are located if they are not all called out individually. Th e hole table gives the 
machinist X and Y locations of the holes that they can use to program their CNC milling machine 
extraordinarily quickly. Don’t be surprised if the machinist asks you to dimension all your parts 
using hole tables.
Annotating Assembly Drawings
Creating/annotating drawing views of assemblies is similar to doing so for parts. All the same 
views and annotation tools discussed in the previous sections can be executed when working 
with assembly and presentation models. When creating views of assemblies, you will typically 
create parts lists and balloons and may need to control reference parts, interference edges, and 
assembly representations. These subjects and others dealing specifi cally with assembly fi les are 
covered in the following sections.
Assembly Representations
The view options available for assembly views are among the most signifi cant differences 
between part and assembly model views. When an assembly fi le is referenced in the base view, 
representation options become available on the Component tab of the Drawing View dialog box. 
These controls allow you to specify which assembly view, positional, or level-of-detail (LOD) 
representation is displayed in the resulting drawing view.
View representations can optionally be made associative to the view (using the check box 
at the top of the View Representation control). Specifi cally, an associative view representation 
means that as a component’s visibility is changed in the assembly, the change is witnessed in 
the drawing view as well. If the associative option is deselected, you can toggle component 
visibility from the drawing itself by expanding the view node in the browser, expanding the 
model tree on the view node, and then right-clicking a component and choosing Visibility. If 
the Visibility option is grayed out, the view is associative, and the component visibility is being 
controlled in the assembly.

622 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Making Your Views Associative
Most of the time you will want to make your views associative. If you do not, you’ll be scratching 
your head trying to ﬁ gure out why the drawing view is not matching your view representation.
Recall the general defi nitions of each assembly representation type:
View Representations  These control component visibility, color overrides, and parts 
list fi lters.
Positional Representations  These show an assembly in different physical positions.
Level-of-Detail Representations  These control visibility and manage memory consump-
tion by suppressing  components.
In the next several steps, you will edit a view of an assembly to see how to use assembly rep-
resentations in drawing views:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_115.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. In the browser, expand the Sheet1 node to reveal the node for each existing view.
 
4. Expand the Main View node to reveal the assembly node and then expand the assembly 
node to reveal the parts tree.
 
5. Right-click the view called Main View and choose Edit View to examine the view options 
dealing with representations. Notice the different representations, as shown in Figure 12.28.
 
6. In the View area, choose the view representation named Frame And Ram and then click 
the OK button.
You’ll notice that all of the parts are gone now except the frame and ram. This was set up 
in the assembly by toggling the visibility state off for all the other parts and then saving 
the view confi guration as a view representation. Examining the browser, you’ll see that 
the parts set to not be visible are grayed out.
Figure 12.28

ANNOTATING ASSEMBLY DRAWINGS | 623
 
7. Right-click the view called Main View and choose Edit View again.
 
8. In the Level Of Detail area, choose the representation named Handle And Ram and then 
click the OK button.
You’ll note that only the ram remains on-screen. This is because you have the view set 
to use two different representations at once. In the view representation, the visibility is 
turned off for everything but the frame and ram, but the frame was suppressed in the 
level of detail. Examining the browser, you’ll see that suppressed parts are not listed.
Typically, it’s best not to use these two representations together because it can be confus-
ing as to what is being controlled where. However, there are times when this is the best 
way to achieve the desired results.
 
9. Right-click the view called Main View and choose Edit View once again.
 
10. Set the view representation to Master and set the positional representation to Closed 
(leave the LOD as is); then click the OK button.
You’ll see that now just the handle, shaft, and ram parts are shown (because of the LOD 
representation), and the positional representation is controlling the positions of these parts.
 
11. Right-click the view called Main View and choose Edit View once more.
 
12. Set the view representation to Default and click the Associative check box button (it looks 
like a chain link).
 
13. Set the LOD representation to Master and then click the OK button.
 
14. In the browser, right-click the Arbor Frame node and notice that the Visibility option is 
grayed out.
 
15. Right-click the Main View node and choose Edit View one more time.
 
16. Uncheck the Associative check box button and then click the OK button.
 
17. In the browser, right-click the Arbor Frame node and notice that the Visibility option is 
now available.
 
18. Click Visibility to toggle it off and notice that the frame is removed from the view.
You are now controlling component visibility at the drawing level rather than using the 
assembly view representation’s visibility controls. You can continue experimenting with the rep-
resentation options and then close the fi le without saving changes.
Open Assembly Drawings With The Fast Open Option
When you select a drawing ﬁ le to open in the Open dialog box, you can then click the Options button 
and select the Fast Open option to open the drawing quickly. When the Fast Open option is selected, 
Inventor skips all of the model ﬁ le references, making no attempt to ﬁ nd the referenced ﬁ les. Once the 
drawing is open, the drawing behavior is that of a drawing that had been opened with no ﬁ le references 
found. You can make changes to the drawing such as text notes, and so on, and then save the changes. 
If you’d like to make the ﬁ le references live once it is open, you can click the top-level node in the 
browser and choose Resolve File.

624 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Reference Data in Drawing Views
Assembly components can be designated as Reference. You can apply this attribute as a document 
setting on the part or assembly fi le itself or on a per-instance basis when it’s placed in a higher-
level assembly. In addition to being omitted from the assembly mass property calculations, BOM, 
and subsequent drawing-parts lists, reference components are drawn and calculated differently 
in assembly drawing views.
By default, all reference component edges are mapped to a unique layer with a broken line 
style (double-dash chain). Hidden-line calculation, by default, is run separately for reference 
components and nonreference components. Finally, reference components do not affect the 
calculation of the drawing boundary. This means that if you have a reference component well 
apart from nonreference parts in an assembly, it may not be visible in a drawing view until you 
increase the reference margin.
To explore these settings, you can open the fi le mi_12a_117.idw in the Chapter 12 direc-
tory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and compare the two views. The view on the left 
shows the reference part at the default settings. The view on the right has been adjusted to show 
the reference part as a standard part. Right-click the view and choose Edit to adjust all the refer-
ence data view behaviors on the Model State tab of the Drawing View dialog box. Figure 12.29 
shows the default settings.
Interference and Tangent Edge Display
As you place and constrain components in an assembly fi le, it may be necessary to create an 
interference condition between parts. This is common for press-fi t conditions such as pins in 
undersized holes. This condition is common in Inventor even when you have a threaded fastener 
being inserted into an equal-diameter threaded hole. These edges are designated as interference 
edges and can be turned on or off as needed.
You can also control the display of tangent edges for cylindrical faces, fi llet edges, and so on, 
in your drawing views. Both tangent and interference edges can be enabled by editing the view 
and selecting the Interference Edge check box on the Display Options tab.
Figure 12.30 shows the difference between two views with these edges turned off and turned 
on. The interference edge in this case is the small set screw in the middle of the plate. All other 
differences are tangent edges.

ANNOTATING ASSEMBLY DRAWINGS | 625
Parts Lists
A parts list is a formatted report of the assembly bill of materials placed on the drawing in a 
table. Most of the data you see in a parts list comes ultimately from the assembly BOM, but the 
BOM and the parts list are managed separately inside Inventor, providing control and fl exibility 
for managing both.
Parts lists have a dedicated formatting style that provides dozens of formatting variations. 
You’ll walk through a typical parts-list editing and creation workfl ow to see what kind of capa-
bilities can be leveraged in the parts lists:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_119.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Manage tab, click the Styles Editor button, expand the Parts List node, and click 
the style named MI_PL_02.
 
4. Click the Column Chooser button and add the Material property from the list on the left. 
Then click the OK button.
 
5. Click the Heading button and change the placement to Bottom.
 
6. Save your changes and exit the Style And Standard Editor dialog box using the Done 
button.
 
7. On the Annotate tab, click the Parts List button.
The Parts List dialog box allows you to either click an assembly or presentation drawing 
view or browse directly to an assembly or presentation fi le (you can create a parts list on a 
drawing with no drawing views). You can choose either a structured (fi rst or all levels) or 
parts-only parts list. If the parts list is too long for the sheet size you’re placing it on, you 
can also enable the option to wrap the parts list based on a specifi ed number of rows.
 
8. Click the view on the sheet, and ensure that Structured is selected for the BOM view type 
and the Direction To Wrap Table option is set to Right. Click the OK button and then snap 
the parts lists to the lower-left corner of the drawing border.

to adjust the width based on the length of the text strings read in from the component 
iProperties. You can adjust column width by clicking and dragging the vertical column 
lines on the parts list on your sheet.
 
9. Resize the Material column on the parts list to better accommodate the long description text.
The initial item numbering for the components and the row order come from the last 
saved state of the assembly BOM but can be changed by editing the parts list.
 
10. Double-click the parts list to launch the Parts List dialog box (or right-click and 
choose Edit).
 
11. Click the Sort button, sort by part number in descending order, and then click the 
OK button.
 
12. Click the Renumber Items button and notice how new item numbers are assigned based 
on the sort order.
The new item numbers appear blue and bold in the Parts List dialog box to indicate that 
they do not match the BOM. Changes you make to any of the cells in the Parts List dialog 
box (except for custom rows or custom columns) are treated as overrides to the BOM data. 
However, only item number overrides can be written back to the BOM. All other over-
rides are preserved at the parts-list level, allowing for greater fl exibility of parts-list edits 
at the drawing level without worries that they will be discarded if updated in the BOM. 
Item number changes can be saved to the assembly BOM cell by cell from the context 
menu or for the entire parts list in one of three ways:
 
◆
While editing the parts list, click the Save Item Overrides To BOM button along 
the top.
 
◆
Right-click the parts list itself on the sheet and choose Save Item Overrides To BOM.
 
◆
Right-click the Parts List browser node and choose Save Item Overrides To BOM.
If you intend for the overrides of properties other than the item numbers to match in both 
the BOM and parts list, you should make those edits in the BOM, where they will push 
through to the parts list. You can access the BOM quickly by right-clicking the parts list 
and choosing Bill Of Materials. Edits made in the BOM editor are written back to compo-
nent iProperties and, therefore, push through to the parts list, provided no parts list over-
rides have already been made.
 
13. Click the OK button to apply the changes and exit the Parts List dialog box.
 
14. Right-click the drawing view and choose Edit View.
 
15. Set the view representation to Frame And Ram and then click the OK button.
Notice that the parts list still displays the full assembly even though the view now shows 
only the frame and ram parts. To set the two to coincide, you will apply a parts list fi lter.
 
16. Edit the parts list and click the Filter button, found along the top of the Parts List 
dialog box.

ANNOTATING ASSEMBLY DRAWINGS | 627
 
17. From the Defi ne Filter Item drop-down box, select Assembly View Representation.
 
18. Choose Frame And Ram from the drop-down box and then click the green check mark. 
Then click the OK button to apply the fi lter.
 
19. Click the OK button in the Parts List dialog box.
You’ll see the parts list update to show only the parts corresponding to the view representa-
tion. The parts list is not directly associated with any drawing view (if you choose a view when 
you create the parts list, it acts only as a pointer to the assembly fi le itself). You can close the fi le 
without saving changes. In the next section, you’ll explore balloons.
Autosort and Update Parts Lists
When sorting a parts list, you can use the Autosort And Update option to maintain the sort order 
even when future parts are added to the assembly ﬁ le.
Balloons
Assembly drawing views are related to parts lists by ballooning the components in the assem-
bly drawing view. Balloons are perhaps the only type of annotation relevant for assembly 
views only. By default, balloons are set to display just a component’s assigned item number, but 
through changes to the balloon style, a balloon can be confi gured to display any component 
iProperty or BOM property. Review the creation and editing of balloon styles in “Editing Styles 
and Standards” earlier in this chapter.
You should know that only items visible in a view can be selected for placing a balloon; how-
ever, you can string multiple balloons together on a single leader, including parts that are not 
visible, virtual parts, and even line items added to the parts list that do not exist in the assembly 
BOM. This is also a common technique when ballooning a collection of hardware such as a 
screw, lock washer, and split washer.
Follow these steps to explore methods and options for balloon placement:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_120.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Annotate tab, click the Balloon button. Select the cap on the end of the handle, 
drag out and click to place the balloon on the sheet, right-click and choose Continue, and 
then right-click again and choose Cancel.
 
4. Right-click the balloon and select Attach Balloon.
 
5. Click the lever arm. The balloon for the lever arm is shown attached to the handle cap’s 
balloon (Figure 12.31). Drag your mouse pointer around the balloon to set the position of 
the attached balloon and then click to place it.
 
6. Right-click the balloon and select Attach Balloon From List.
 
7. Select the box next to Spare Cap and click the OK button. The spare cap is a virtual com-
ponent created in the assembly BOM.

628 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Balloons can be added one at a time, or you can use the Auto Balloon tool (under the 
Balloon fl yout) to quickly add multiple balloons to a drawing view.
 
8. Click the drop-down on the Balloon button and select Auto Balloon.
 
9. Select the view on the sheet and then window-select all the components in the view.
 
10. Click the Select Placement button and change the placement options. Move your mouse 
pointer around the sheet to see how the preview graphics update.
 
11. Set the placement option to Horizontal, place the balloons above the assembly, and then 
click the OK button.
Here are some tips for working with balloons:
 
◆
Click a balloon to reposition it on-screen.
 
◆
Click the leader and drag it off the part edge and onto a part face if using the edge does not 
make clear what part is being specifi ed.
 
◆
Be aware that items are not updated in balloon contents when they’re not attached to an 
edge, so if you pull a balloon from the edge of item 1 and place it on the face of item 2, the 
balloon will still read item 1.
 
◆
You can reassociate balloons from one part to another part by dragging the arrowhead 
from one part edge to the edge of a different part.
 
◆
Balloons not attached to an edge use an alternative leader style (most often a dot). You can 
specify a different alternative leader style in the balloon style.
 
◆
If you right-click a balloon and choose Edit Balloon or double-click anywhere on the bal-
loon, you can change the item number and have it update the part list. Or, you can type in 
an override, and it will not update the parts list.
 
◆
If you right-click a balloon leader, you can choose Attach Text To Leader and add text along 
the leader line.
Explore the balloon options and then close the fi le without saving changes.

Center of Gravity Display
You can display the center of gravity (COG) of a part or assembly in a drawing view as a center 
mark. Only one COG can be shown per view, with the exception of overlay views. Using a draw-
ing containing an overlay view, you will take a look at displaying the COG marker in a drawing 
to show the change in the COG between the two overlaid positional representations:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_123.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Expand the sheet node in the browser and locate the Base View node and expand it.
 
4. Right-click the mi_12a_115 assembly icon and select Center Of Gravity.
Doing so recalculates the model’s center of gravity (it does not read the value in from the 
model’s physical properties) and draws a center mark at the calculated location.
 
5. Locate the overlay node in the browser and expand it.
 
6. Right-click the mi_12a_115 assembly icon listed in the overlay tree and select Center 
Of Gravity.
 
7. Finally, dimension the location of these center marks relative to the bottom-right corner of 
the Arbor Press frame.
 
8. Double-click to edit one of these dimensions and add (COG) as a suffi x to the dimension 
value on the Text tab of the Edit Dimension dialog box.
 
9. Right-click the dimension and use the Copy Properties option to copy this appended text 
to the other COG dimensions, as shown in Figure 12.32.

Working with Sheet-Metal Drawings
Drawing views of sheet-metal parts offer some unique options beyond those normally avail-
able for conventional part fi les. Among these are the inclusion of bend notes, bend lines, punch 
notes, bend tables, and the creation of fl at pattern views.
Flat Pattern Views
When a sheet-metal part fi le has a fl at pattern defi nition, you can create a drawing view of the 
folded model or the fl at pattern. You can include both as well, but you need to separate base 
views to do so. To take a look at these options, follow these steps to create a fl at pattern drawing 
view to start off:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_130.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Right-click the existing isometric view and choose Open to open the model fi le.
 
4. Take a look at the model and note that this fi le has been created using the sheet-metal 
tools discussed in Chapter 6, “Sheet Metal,” and that a fl at pattern has been generated in 
the model.
 
5. Use the fi le tabs at the bottom of the screen to switch back to the drawing fi le (or press 
Ctrl+Tab).
 
6. On the Place Views tab, click the Base View button.
 
7. Ensure that the component listed in the File drop-down is mi_12a_130.ipt.
 
8. On the Component tab in the Drawing View dialog box, select the Flat Pattern option as 
well as the Recover Punch Center option, set the scale to fi t that sheet, and then place the 
view of the fl at pattern on the sheet.
Leave this fi le open because you will use it in the following pages.
Bend Centerlines and Extents
Bend centerlines are drawn on sheet-metal fl at pattern views where the center of the bend is 
located on the material face. Inventor tracks negative and positive bend centerlines independently 
of one another to enable users to apply different line formatting for these two conditions. This has 
already been done in mi_12a_130.idw, but it should be noted that the default behavior is to have 
both positive and negative bend lines placed on the same layer. If you want to separate them, sim-
ply create a new layer called Bend Centerline (negative); then under Object Defaults in the Styles 
And Standards Editor, assign Sheet Metal Bend Centerline (+) and (-) to the appropriate layers.
Lines representing bend extents can be enabled by right-clicking the fl at pattern view, choos-
ing Edit View, selecting the Display Options tab, and selecting the Bend Extents option.
Bend and Punch Notes
You’ll fi nd two sheet-metal-specifi c annotation tools on the Annotate tab: Bend Notes and 
Punch Notes.

WORKING WITH SHEETMETAL DRAWINGS | 631
Bend notes are placed on bend centerlines in sheet-metal fl at pattern views and can convey 
information about the bending operation, including the bend radius, direction, angle, and 
K-factor. To place bend and punch notes, continue working with the mi_12a_130.idw fi le or 
open this fi le and activate Sheet2 to pick up from this point:
 
1. Click the Bend button on the Feature Notes panel of the Annotate tab.
 
2. Click one of the bend centerlines in the drawing view to place a single note.
 
3. To place the rest of the bend notes, window-select the entire view. This tool looks only 
for bend centerlines, so you needn’t be concerned about unintentionally selecting regular 
model edges.
By default, the bend notes are drawn adjacent to the bend centerlines, but where the note may 
be obscured in the view, you can drag individual bend notes to fl ip them to the opposite side of 
the bend centerline, or you can drag away from the bend centerline, and a leader will be gener-
ated back to the bend centerline. Try this with the two outermost bend notes on the electrical-box 
fl at pattern view (shown in Figure 12.33).
The style formatting and direct editing of bend notes is identical to formatting and editing 
hole notes. You can preconfi gure the contents of the note with the note’s dimension style by add-
ing one or more variable tokens for the bend note attributes. Punch notes are used to convey 
information about sheet-metal punch features (a special kind of iFeature). Punch notes can be 
applied only to fl at pattern views of sheet-metal parts. They can be attached to recovered punch 
centers (shown as center marks in the fl at pattern drawing) or on any model edge generated by 
the punch.
Punch notes can be confi gured to display the punch identifi er (defi ned as part of the iFeature 
defi nition), the punch angle, the depth, and the direction. Punch notes are likewise formatted 
through dimension styles and have a similar editing interface to hole notes.
Figure 12.33
Bend notes in ﬂ at pat-
tern view

632 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Bend Tables
Bend information can alternatively be displayed in a table rather than a note. A bend table is 
generated using the General button on the Table panel on the Annotate tab. The Table tool basi-
cally morphs into several different kinds of tables depending on what you specify as a data 
source. If a fl at pattern view is selected, a bend table will be generated.
To create a bend table for mi_12a_130.idw, activate Sheet3 and then follow these steps:
General Tables
If no data source is selected in the Table dialog box, you’ll end up with an empty table that you 
can populate manually. You can also browse and import data from a CSV or XLS ﬁ le into the table.
 
1. Click the General button on the Table panel of the Annotate tab.
 
2. Select the fl at pattern view.
 
3. Click the Column Chooser button and select Bend Radius from the list on the right.
 
4. Click the Remove button and then click the OK button.
 
5. For Bend ID, select the Alpha option and then click the OK button.
 
6. Place the table on the sheet and adjust the bend ID tags as required by clicking them and 
dragging.
A bend table is edited and maintained like a parts list. The Table dialog box is essentially 
identical, and any changes to the cell data are treated as overrides to the data source (in this 
case, the bend data stored in the sheet-metal fi le). You can close the fi le without saving changes. 
Figure 12.34 shows a simple bend table and bend ID tags.
Figure 12.34
Bend table

WORKING WITH WELDMENT VIEWS | 633
Punch Tables
Punch information can likewise be displayed in a table, but because punches closely resemble 
holes with respect to the kind of information required to be displayed, a hole table is used to 
generate tabulated punch data. The only difference between creating a hole table and creating 
a punch table is that you use a predefi ned hole table style that is set to pick up only sheet-metal 
punch features. Here are the general steps used to create a punch table:
 
1. Ensure that your fl at pattern view has been set to collect punch centers. (Right-click and 
select Edit View ➢ Recover Punch Centers.)
 
2. Start the Hole Table–View tool (using the Hole View button found on the Table panel of 
the Annotate tab).
 
3. Select the fl at pattern view.
 
4. Select an origin point.
 
5. Prior to placing the table, change the table’s style to a punch table style. If you forget this 
step, you can always select the existing hole table and change it to the punch table style 
using the Style drop-down (top right of the screen).
Figure 12.35 shows a simple punch table.
Working with Weldment Views
Weldments are a special kind of assembly model and offer unique drawing view and annota-
tion options in the Drawing Manager. Here, you’ll take a quick look at the way drawing views 
handle weldment stages for detailing. For more information on working with weldments and 
weldment annotation, refer to Chapter 10, “Weldment Design.” A drawing view of a weldment 
assembly can display any of the weldment states, which are as follows:
Assembly  Displays the base assembly prior to the preparation, welding, and 
machining stages.
Machining  Displays assembly features that represent the post-weld machining and 
fi nishing.
Figure 12.35
Punch table

634 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Welds  Displays the assembly as it exists during the weld stage, before machining but after 
preparations have been made. Weld beads are also shown.
Preparations  Displays assembly features such as chamfers, extrude cuts, and holes used 
to remove material to prepare the assembly for welding. You can set the view to display the 
entire assembly during the preparation stage or set the view to look at a single component as 
it exists at the preparation stage.
Follow these steps to explore the way weldments are handled in drawings and 
drawing views:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_139.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Notice the following about the views on this drawing sheet:
 
◆
View-1 through View-4 show the assembly with no preparations, welds, or machining.
 
◆
View-P1 through View-P3 show each part at the preparation stage.
 
◆
View-W1 shows the weldment with welds but no machining done after the weld stage.
 
4. Right-click View-1 and choose Edit View; then click the Model State tab in the Drawing 
View dialog box.
 
5. Currently, this view and the views projected from it are set to the assembly state. Select 
the Machining option, as shown in Figure 12.36, so the view displays the completed 
weldment. Click the OK button.
Figure 12.36
Weldment state 
settings
 
6. Notice that View-1 through View-4 now show the weldment at its completion, including 
the machined holes that run through the weld on one side (see Detail A).
 
7. Edit View-W1 and check the Model State tab to see that it is set to the Welds option.
 
8. Click the Display Options tab and select the options to recover weld annotations and 
model weld symbols. Then click the OK button.
 
9. Because the weldment included the weld symbols, they can be pulled into the drawing. 
Click each symbol and use the grip snaps to arrange them as you like.

WORKING WITH IPARTS AND IASSEMBLY DRAWINGS | 635
You’ll also notice a series of arcs indicating the weld bead brought in via the Weld 
Annotations option. You can right-click those and choose Edit Caterpillar to adjust the 
appearance of each, or you can turn the visibility off as required. Figure 12.37 shows the 
view with recovered weld annotation and symbols.
 
10. Edit View-P1 through View-P3 to check the Model State tab settings for these views. 
Notice that each of these views is actually created from the assembly fi le but is set to look 
at the individual parts at their preparations stage.
You might also note that the balloons on View-P1 through View-P3 are calling out the fi le-
names and that both of the side plates are the same fi le but have opposing chamfers. This is 
because a common plate was used for both sides and then prepared as required in the weld-
ment assembly. If you were to make views of the parts themselves instead of each part at the 
weldment preparation stage, the chamfers would not be present. You can close this fi le without 
saving changes.
If you don’t need to use the weldment tools in assembly modeling but still need to convey 
welding information in a drawing, you can create weld symbols and weld annotations (end fi lls 
and caterpillars) manually on the drawing view. Each is available in the Symbols panel of the 
Annotate tab (as shown in Figure 12.38) and is formatted by a dedicated style (the Weld Symbol 
style and Weld Bead style, respectively).
Working with iParts and iAssembly Drawings
When your drawing view references an iPart or iAssembly, you can choose, from the drawing 
view Model State tab, which member fi le you want to document.

636 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Annotations (particularly dimensions) attached to drawing views of iParts and iAssemblies 
generally remain attached if you edit the base view and change the iPart member on the Model 
State tab. This means you can fully annotate just one iPart or iAssembly member and select Save 
Copy As for each unique member after changing the member referenced in the base view. Or 
you can create a tabulated drawing detailing all of the iPart/iAssembly members on a single 
sheet. To look at this workfl ow, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_12a_148.idw in the Chapter 12 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Annotate tab, click the General button on the Table panel.
 
4. Select the fl at pattern view on the sheet to set the focus of the table.
 
5. Because this part fi le is both a sheet-metal part and an iPart, you are given the choice to 
create either a bend table or an iPart table (you can create both but need to do so in suc-
cessive steps). Set the table data source to iPart/iAssembly Table.
 
6. Click the Column Chooser button and use the Add button to include the Length param-
eter; then click the OK button.
 
7. Click the OK button in the Table dialog box and place the table on the sheet.
 
8. Right-click the 100 mm dimension at the top of the fl at patter, and choose Edit. Select the 
Hide Dimension Value box and then type Length in the text box below. Then click the 
OK button.
 
9. Right-click the table and choose Edit; then right-click the Member header in the table and 
select Format Column.
 
10. Deselect the Name From Data Source box, enter Mark #, click the OK button, and 
then click the OK button again to return to the sheet. Your table should resemble 
Figure 12.39.
If you create a tabulated drawing in this manner and then add rows to the iPart/
iAssembly table, your drawing table will automatically add the new rows as well. Rows can 
then be hidden in the table if needed simply by editing the table on the sheet and then right-
clicking the row in the table editor and unselecting Visibility. You can close the fi le without 
saving changes.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 637
Sharing Your Drawings Outside Your Workgroup
Once your design is fully annotated, you can share the design documents with others in numer-
ous ways. Of course, the traditional hard-copy route is available from the Print tool, but there 
are electronic means to share your Inventor drawings with people who do not have Inventor. 
The native fi le formats offer several possibilities. Inventor IPT, IAM, IPN, and IDW fi les can 
be viewed using the freely distributed Inventor View application. A version of this is already 
installed with Inventor but can be downloaded for free from the Autodesk website.
As mentioned earlier, if you use DWG as your drawing-fi le format, anyone with a copy of 
AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT® 2007 software or newer can view, plot, and measure the Inventor 
drawing. There are object enablers on the Autodesk website that even allow older versions of 
AutoCAD to open Inventor DWG fi les.
Using the Publish tool you can generate a neutral DWF or DWFx fi le. The DWF or DWFx fi le 
can store both your 2D drawing and the 3D models referenced in the drawing. DWF fi les are 
viewed using Autodesk Design Review, which is available for download from the Autodesk 
website. To publish a DWF fi le, fi rst click the Inventor button (the large I in the upper-left corner) 
and then select Export ➢ Export To DWF.
You can fi nd any of the products mentioned earlier by going to www.autodesk.com or www
.google.com and searching for one of these terms:

PDF is a popular publishing format that can be read by Adobe Acrobat Reader. You can save a 
PDF from Inventor using the Save Copy As option and changing the fi le type to PDF or by using 
Export ➢ Export To PDF. You can also download a number of PDF printer drivers that will allow you 
to print to PDF. Acrobat Reader is available for download from Adobe’s website: www.adobe.com.
There are some options for creating PDFs found by clicking the Options button in the Save 
Copy As dialog box when the fi le type is set to PDF. For instance, you might want to include 
all sheets in the PDF and create it in black and white. You can do so using the Options button. 
Unfortunately, you cannot confi gure these options to be the defaults.
You should note that the option to have the PDF viewer automatically open the PDF when it 
is created is a bit hidden and is set with the Publish options used when creating a DWF. To dis-
able the automatic view of PDFs, click the Inventor button (the large I in the upper-left corner) 
and select Export ➢ Export To DWF. Then uncheck the Display Published File In Viewer option.
Additional Resources
In addition to the step-by-step information and exercises in this chapter, tutorials can be found 
by choosing the Get Started tab and looking in the Videos And Tutorials area.
Th e Bottom Line
Create templates and styles.  Inventor provides numerous methods to create, store, and 
use drawing templates and styles. Careful planning as to how and where to manage these 
resources is important. Consideration must be given to how templates are deployed on your 
network and whether to use the style library.

638 | CHAPTER 12 DOCUMENTATION
Master It  Rather than using one of the out-of-the-box drawing settings, you need to set 
up a drawing template, a drafting standard, and annotation styles to conform to a par-
ticular international, industry, or company drafting standard. How do you get started?
Utilize drawing resources.  Each Inventor drawing fi le contains a number of commonly 
used drawing-resource defi nitions, such as title blocks, borders, symbols, and so on. These 
resource defi nitions allow you store preconfi gured items for quick and easy reuse.
Master It  You have blocks of general notes that you place on every drawing fi le. 
However, some drawings get one set of notes, and others get another, so making these 
notes part of the title block seems to be the wrong approach. Is there a way to handle this 
in Inventor? 
Edit styles and standards.  Inventor’s drawing styles and standards allow you to set up 
your dimension styles, layer styles, and so on, in advance so that you can maintain consis-
tency across all of your drawings.
Master It  You have set up your object defaults to use an inch-based dimension style, but 
occasionally you want to place a millimeter-based dimension. Can this be done easily, or 
do you have to override the dimension style?
Create drawing views.  Drawing views allow you to make 2D views of your 3D models. 
The hidden line generation and alignment of your projected views are automatic, as are 
updates to the 2D views when your 3D models change. 
Master It  When placing a drawing view, the lines on curved edges don’t show up. 
Is there an option to turn these on?
Annotate part drawings.  Adding annotation to your part drawings is accomplished 
primarily using the tools found on the Annotate tab. Many of these tools automate tradi-
tional drafting annotation, but you might still fi nd the need to add annotation in a more 
manual way.
Master It  You need to create sheet-metal fl at patterns for your parts with laser etch-
ing on them. Often this is text, but you’ve noticed that if you attempt to create text as an 
extrusion on the part, you end up with a stencil effect, rather than single-line characters 
used for etching. Is there a way to do this?
Annotate assembly drawings.  Often, much of the annotation created for assembly draw-
ings concerns bill of materials information, but you can use most of the same annotation 
tools used for part drawings in an assembly drawing.
Master It  You created a section view of your assembly model and then noticed that you 
could hide the hatch pattern by right-clicking it and choosing Hide. But now when you 
right-click the drawing view, you can’t fi nd an option to bring back the hatch pattern. 
Is it gone for good? 
Work with sheet-metal drawings.  Inventor sheet-metal drawings give you access to 
the folded model and the fl at pattern, provided that a fl at pattern has been created in the 
3D model.
Master It  When you place a bend note on a fl at pattern drawing, it places the direction, 
angle, and bend radius. Your shop is accustomed to seeing only the direction and angle. 
Is there a way to remove the bend radius?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 639
Work with weldment views.  Weldment views offer some extra functionality over standard 
assembly views in that they allow you to document your assembly in each weldment stage.
Master It  You want to create a drawing package that shows all of the weldment pieces 
in the prepped stage and then show the weldment assembly in the completed form. 
What’s the best way to do this?
Work with iParts and iAssembly drawings.  One of the benefi ts of creating part and 
assembly families as iParts and iAssemblies is the ability to created tabulated drawings that 
show each member and its key dimensions in a table.
Master It  You’ve created an iPart table and want to set the dimension on the sheet to 
match the table heading. Is this possible?
Share your drawings outside your workgroup.  You can save your drawings in DWF, 
DWFx, and PDF formats in order to share them with people who do not have Inventor. You

Chapter 13
Tools Overview
Using the various Autodesk® Inventor® tools effectively helps you improve your productivity 
and get the most out of the program. In this chapter you will explore many of the tools that are 
included with your Inventor installation. Some of these are located within Inventor, and others 
are external applications. Initially, a certain amount of familiarity is required to be productive 
with these tools; however, spending the time to become familiar with them pays off in the long 
run. Most of the topics in this chapter do not apply to the Autodesk® Inventor LT™ program.
This chapter assumes you have a good understanding of parts, assemblies, and drawings. 
You will learn about the various aspects of Inventor tools and about some of the add-ins. You’ll 
look at the key aspects of the tools and add-ins that come with Inventor as well as relevant 
workfl ows. Many other tools can be built using the application programming interface (API). 
Although the API is not covered in this book, you can fi nd a great deal of information online 
about using it to develop your own tools.
This chapter covers a number of tools, including the BIM Exchange, AutoLimits, Design 
Assistant, Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard, style tools, Supplier Content Center, the Task 
Scheduler, the iProperties tool, the Measure tool, the Customer Involvement Program (CIP), 
customer error reporting (CER), and more.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Take your models from Inventor to the Autodesk Building Systems program
 
◆
Create AutoLimits (design sensors)
 
◆
Manage design data effi ciently using Inventor tools
 
◆
Manage styles
 
◆
Create expressions with iProperties
 
◆
Give feedback to Autodesk
Exploring the BIM Exchange
The Building Information Modeling (BIM) Exchange is an add-in environment for parts and 
assemblies. Using the BIM Exchange, you can import Inventor models into the AutoCAD® MEP 
and Autodesk® Revit® MEP products, which are used for building design and construction sys-
tems. The MEP products are used to document the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing infor-
mation of the designs. To access the BIM Exchange environment, you must fi rst have a part or an 
assembly fi le open and then select the Environments tab and click BIM Exchange.

642 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Assembly Model Simpliﬁ cation
Typically, when you author an Inventor model for use with a building systems application (such 
as Revit, for example), you will want to reduce the amount of detail in that model so the fi le size 
is smaller and so you are not giving away too much intellectual property. You can start with an 
assembly fi le and use the Simplify tools to prepare your model for exporting and sharing with 
BIM applications. To access these tools, you can click the Simplify tab in the assembly environ-
ment, where you will fi nd the following tools:
Include Components  Use this tool to create a view representation using only the selected 
components. You can then choose this view representation to create the exported BIM model. 
For instance, you might use this tool to select only the externally visible components of a 
condensing unit assembly to prepare it for use in Autodesk Revit MEP. The result would be 
a new view representation created in the Representations folder of the browser and named 
something like Simple View1. To edit the resulting view representation, you simply right-
click it in the browser and choose Edit Include Components.
Defi ne Envelopes  Use this tool to replace an assembly component with a rectangular or 
cylindrical bounding box. For instance, you might use this to remove extra detail for com-
ponents such as fasteners. Defi ning the envelope of a bolt allows a model to be used for fi t 
checks and sizing where, for example, a protruding bolt head might be important, while 
at the same time it greatly reduces the number of model faces and edges the component is 
made up of.
Create Simplifi ed Parts  Use this tool to create a simplifi ed part fi le from an assembly 
view by referencing the current view representation. For instance, if you used the Include 
Components tool to create a view representation of just the externally visible components of a 
condensing unit assembly, you could then use the Create Simplifi ed Part tool to combine the 
remaining visible components into a single part model.
Exploring the Include Components Tool
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 13 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/
masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction 
for the download and setup instructions.
Once you’re sure you have the Chapter 13 fi les in place, follow these steps to see the Include 
Components tool in action:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_014.iam in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Simplify tab, click the Include Components button.

8. Expand the Representations folder in the browser, if required, and locate the node for 
the active, simple view representation. It will have a check mark next to it.
 
9. Right-click the simple view representation and choose Edit Include Components to bring 
back the Include Components tools.
 
10. Hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and click the components named mi_13a_4035 to 
exclude them from the simplifi ed view representation and then click the OK button in 
the tool controls to update the simplifi ed view representation. The results are shown 
in Figure 13.3.

In this example, the resulting simple view representation is not really that much simpler, but 
you’ve explored the methods used to create and update a simplifi ed view representation using 
the Include Components tool. You can close the current fi le without saving changes and con-
tinue to the next section.
Exploring the Define Envelopes Tool
The Defi ne Envelopes tool can be used to reduce the number of faces and edges present in an 
assembly model, which will help reduce the fi le size of the BIM export version. You can follow 
these steps to see the Defi ne Envelopes tool in action:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_016.iam in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Simplify tab, click the Defi ne Envelopes button.
 
4. In the tool controls, locate the Select All Occurrences button and ensure that the check 
box is selected.
 
5. Find an instance of the cap screw named mi_13a_4762 and select it.
 
6. In the tool controls, locate the Bounding Box/Bounding Cylinder control and change it to 
Bounding Cylinder, as shown in Figure 13.4.
Figure 13.4
Creating a bounding 
cylinder

EXPLORING THE BIM EXCHANGE | 645
 
7. Use the grip arrows to adjust the size of the bounding cylinder to your liking.
 
8. Click the Apply button (it looks like a green plus sign) found in the tool controls to defi ne 
the bounding envelopes for the screws.
 
9. Notice that the browser nodes for both of the mi_13a_4762 components are gray, indicat-
ing that they have been hidden. And notice, too, that a browser node named Envelope1 
has been created to represent the screws.
 
10. Select one of the mi_13a_Bushing components and set it to use a bounding box and 
then click the OK button to create the bounding boxes for both bushings, as shown in 
Figure 13.5.
Figure 13.5
Th e resulting 
envelopes
You’ll notice that a new envelope is created in the browser for the bushing components. If 
you need to modify the envelope, you can right-click it and choose Edit Envelope, Delete, or 
Show Original. Feel free to experiment with the Defi ne Envelope tool to see how you can use 
it to reduce the details of other components in the assembly. When you have fi nished, you can 
close the current fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Exploring the Create Simplified Part Tool
The Create Simplifi ed Part tool can be used to derive the active assembly fi le into a new part fi le, 
using the current view representation and any component envelopes that might be present. You 
can follow these steps to create a derived part using the Create Simplifi ed Part tool:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_018.iam in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Simplify tab, click the Create Simplifi ed Part button.

646 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
 
4. Use the Combine Style buttons to select a Solid Body style. This option handles how 
the components of the assembly will be combined as solid bodies in the resulting derived 
part fi le. If your goal is to reduce the amount of intellectual property in the fi le you pro-
vide others, you’d want to use the leftmost button to merge the seams between solid 
bodies and make it more diffi cult for the fi le you create to be used to reverse-engineer 
the design.
 
5. Enter Simple_mi_13a_018 in the New Component Name input.
 
6. Accept the default value for the template fi le or use the Browse Templates button (it looks 
like a blank sheet of paper) to select a different part fi le template.
 
7. Set the New File Location path to the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and then click the OK button. Figure 13.6 shows the Create 
Simplifi ed Part dialog entries and selections.
Figure 13.6
Creating a sim-
pliﬁ ed part
 
8. Examine the browser in the resulting new part fi le to fi nd the derived assembly node and 
extrusion features for each assembly-level envelope, as shown in Figure 13.7.
Figure 13.7
Th e simpliﬁ ed 
derived part
The simplifi ed derived part behaves the same as any other derived part, which means that 
edits to the original assembly fi le are carried through to the simplifi ed part version unless you 
right-click the derived assembly browser node and choose to suppress or break the link to the 
base component. Keep in mind that, at this point, your new simplifi ed derived part exists only in 
the current Inventor session and has not yet been saved to disk. If you’d like to explore the link 

EXPLORING THE BIM EXCHANGE | 647
between the original fi le and the simplifi ed fi le, you can save both fi les now. Otherwise, you can 
close the current simplifi ed part fi le and the original assembly fi le without saving changes and 
continue to the next section.
Part Model Simpliﬁ cation
In addition to the tools available to simplify assembly models, you can also use the BIM Feature 
Recognition and Simplify tools in the parts environment to reduce details that are not needed 
for BIM models, and you can use the Recognize Revit Features tools to make your models 
friendlier to Autodesk Revit.
Simplify Part Models
One of the issues with handing part models created in Inventor to the BIM user is that the 
models often contain cosmetic or manufacturing features that are important in the mechani-
cal design but are not required for the BIM layout and planning application. For example, if 
you create a model of a machined part in Inventor, you will likely need to include and specify 
rounded edges, holes, and other features as part of the mechanical design. However, these fea-
tures are not important to the BIM user and can slow down the BIM application. So to help with 
this, Inventor includes part simplifi cation tools to remove detail and voids, as well as reduce the 
number of faces and edges in a part model.
You can fi nd the Simplify tools by going to the Environments tab and clicking the BIM 
Feature Recognition button or by right-clicking anywhere on the 3D Model tab and choosing 
Show Panels and then Simplify. The Simplify tools include the following:
Remove Details  Use this tool to reduce the number of faces and edges by removing small 
cosmetic fi llets and chamfers as well as any other face selections you decide to remove.
Fill Voids  Often a part contains holes and pockets that are meaningful in the mechani-
cal design but are not important in BIM layout. You can use this tool to select and fi ll these 
voids in order to reduce the number of edges and faces and therefore simplify the model’s 
geometry.

648 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Defi ne Envelopes  Use this tool to reduce the number of faces and edges of complex fea-
tures in order to make part models easier to work with. For instance, you might represent 
a highly intricate machined feature with a simple bounding box.
Recognize Revit Features
Many Inventor users create models to be used in Autodesk Revit libraries. To assist with this, 
it can helpful to set up the model so that it imports into Revit smoothly and predictably. You 
can make your models more “BIM ready” by using the Recognize Revit Features tools. Once 
features are recognized, you can enter the BIM Exchange environment to author the model for 
Revit export.
Recognize Extrude  Recognizes Inventor extruded features and converts them to extrusions 
recognized by Revit
Recognize Revolve  Recognizes Inventor revolved features and converts them to revolu-
tions recognized by Revit
Recognize Sweep  Recognizes Inventor swept features and converts them to sweeps recog-
nized by Revit
Auto Recognize  Automatically recognizes Inventor extruded and revolved features and 
removes fi llets and chamfers

EXPLORING THE BIM EXCHANGE | 649
Model Authoring
The BIM Exchange environment allows you to author Autodesk Revit family data in your 
Inventor model and create connector objects such as cables, conduits, ducts, and pipes on the 
simplifi ed model. These connector objects defi ne the interfaces, which are the connection points 
between Inventor and the BIM model. Inventor allows you to create, edit, and delete connector 
objects. Here are the steps to create a conduit connector:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_444.ipt in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select the Environments tab and click the BIM Exchange button.
 
4. From the MEP Author panel, click the Conduit Connector button.
 
5. In the Conduit Connector dialog box, select Circular as the shape for the connector (using 
Undefi ned allows you to select any oval, circular, or rectangular face).
 
6. Select the yellow circular face to place the connector. The location of the connector 
appears as a cylindrical arrow. Click the direction button to reverse the connector direc-
tion so that it points out away from the box.
 
7. Click the check box in the Size fi eld and enter a value. Or you can leave the check box 
deselected to have the value linked to the model.
 
8. In the Connection Type drop-down menu, select Threaded.
 
9. Click the OK button to create the connector. Figure 13.8 shows the Conduit Connector 
dialog box.
Figure 13.8
Adding a conduit 
connection
 
10. Use the Pipe Connector button on the MEP Author panel to add a supply pipe connection 
to the blue circular face. Take a moment to explore the System Type options and author 
this connection with a type and property values of your choice.

650 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
 
11. Use the Duct Connector button on the MEP Author panel to add an exhaust duct con-
nector to the rectangular face on the top of the unit. Again, set the properties to values of 
your choice and explore the options available.
 
12. Expand the MEP System Connections folder in the browser, as shown in Figure 13.9, and 
you’ll fi nd all of your connections categorized in subfolders. You can edit, delete, and 
suppress connectors as needed.
Figure 13.9
MEP system connec-
tions in the browser
Feel free to create new connections to explore these tools further. When fi nished, you can 
close the fi le without saving changes.
Model Publishing
A part in the BIM Exchange is the basic unit, that is, a specifi c size of the component placed within 
a part family. The part has instance-specifi c properties associated with it, such as a name and geo-
metric representation. You can use the Export Building Components tool to save model geometry, 
properties, and connectors to an Autodesk exchange fi le (*.adsk) or a Revit family fi le (*.rfa). 
An ADSK fi le can be read by programs such as Revit MEP and AutoCAD MEP. However, Revit 
family fi les are typically preferred by Revit users because they provide a more direct handoff of 
the library data.
When publishing a model, it’s often useful to set up the user coordinate system (USC) to 
match the destination coordinate orientation so that the models do not import upside down 
or fl ipped over. You can do this in the BIM Exchange environment by creating a UCS and then 
specifying its use when exporting the data.
In the following exercise, you will set up a model to be exported from Inventor and imported 
into Autodesk software. Follow these steps to publish a model in the BIM Exchange tools:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_445.ipt located in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and then click the Open button.
 
3. Choose the Environments tab and then click the BIM Exchange button. Note that the con-
nectors have been authored already. Do not be too concerned that this exercise model is 
not realistic in its confi guration; its purpose is merely to demonstrate the available tools.

8. Click the Check Design button and notice the listing of information. The green check 
marks indicate that the information required is present. Yellow check marks warn you if 
some information is missing. Click the OK button.
 
9. Click the Check Revit Features button and wait for the *.html report to open in your web 
browser.
In the Feature Check Report you’ll see that there is an error with the feature called Base2. 
To resolve this, you could exit the BIM Exchange environment and use the BIM Feature 
Recognize tool to convert Base2 into extrude features that Revit will recognize. For now, 
though, you can ignore the error, close the report, and continue.
 
10. On the BIM Exchange tab, click the Export Building Components button.
 
11. To set the component type, click the Browse button.

17. Set the Thumbnail option to Import From File and then click the Import button to browse 
for the fi le called Unit Heater 1200 Series.png, found in the Chapter 13 folder.
 
18. When the thumbnail is set, click the Apply Changes button.
 
19. Click the OK button in the Export Building Components dialog box to save an ADSK fi le 
(you can click Cancel and choose not to save this fi le if you’d like).
A Typical Scenario for the BIM Exchange
Say your company uses Inventor and specializes in electrical and mechanical designs and that you 
supply the air conditioner for a building being designed by an architectural ﬁ rm. To minimize the 
risk of losing information and future rework, you meet with the architectural and construction 
ﬁ rms to ensure that the interfaces between your product and the building are all agreed on. Th e 
architects and contractors do not care about any internal details of the air conditioner unit and 
actually prefer having a lightweight model that will not add extra overhead to the Revit model, but 
they are extremely sensitive to any changes in the interfaces between your product and their work.
Th e plan is to author your model and interfaces in Inventor and send the design to the architectural 
ﬁ rm so that they can use your model to know exactly the dimensions and locations to tie into. 
Although you can output the ﬁ les from the BIM Exchange tools to Revit users as is, it becomes 
apparent that having your products authored in Revit format will allow Revit designers to specify 
your products in their designs more quickly and accurately.
Depending on the relationship you have with the architectural ﬁ rm, you may be able to trade the 
simpliﬁ ed models that you output from the BIM Exchange tools in return for the fully functional 
and tested Revit family ﬁ les to be placed on your company’s website for download by other ﬁ rms 
that would like to specify your product line in their designs. If the architectural ﬁ rm does not have 
the time to do this for you, it may be determined that hiring outside help to test and verify Revit 
ﬁ les is the way to go.

USING AUTOLIMITS | 653
Using AutoLimits
The AutoLimits tool allows you to monitor model changes so that you can reduce errors and 
engineering changes. You can think of it as a sensor. For example, say you are a plastics manu-
facturer and want to analyze the situation when the wall thickness of the components becomes 
too thin, or perhaps you are a machinist and want to know when two holes come too close to 
one another. You want to defi ne this “check” and ensure that such a situation is caught early in 
the design. With AutoLimits, you can set up these limits and let the system warn you.
The AutoLimits that you create with the tool are passive and do not drive geometry or stop 
a feature from violating a limit. They simply notify you when it does. Another way to look at 
the AutoLimits tool is as a persistent Measure tool. With the standard Measure tool, the result 
of a measurement is not saved, whereas with the AutoLimits tool the measurement persists. 
When you open a fi le, the AutoLimits you have created are not shown unless you activate the 
AutoLimits panel bar.
The AutoLimits tool monitors the following limits:
Dimensional  Length, Distance, Angle, Diameter, Minimum Distance
Area-Perimeter  Area, Perimeter
Physical Property  Volume, Mass
Figure 13.11 shows the AutoLimits tool icons as accessed from the AutoLimits panel of the 
Inspect tab. 
Figure 13.11
AutoLimits access
Turn On AutoLimits
If you do not see the AutoLimits tools on the Inspect tab, navigate to the Tools tab and click the 
Add-Ins button. Click AutoLimits in the Add-Ins list and then select the Loaded/Unloaded check 
box at the bottom of the dialog to load the AutoLimits tools. You can select the Load Automatically 
check box to have Inventor load them for you on startup.
Feedback is given to the user in terms of shape and color, as in the following examples:
 
◆
A green circle means it is within the boundary limit.
 
◆
A yellow inverted triangle means it is near the boundary limit.
 
◆
A red square means it is beyond the limit.
Figure 13.12 shows the different types of AutoLimits and their settings. (Click the AutoLimits 
Settings button shown in Figure 13.11 to access this dialog box.) You can control the visibility 
of each AutoLimits type by using the On and Off radio buttons. In an assembly, only the edited 

654 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
document’s AutoLimits are visible in the browser; in other words, AutoLimits at subassembly 
levels are not visible or available unless that subassembly is edited.
Figure 13.12
Th e AutoLimits 
Settings dialog box
To see AutoLimits in action, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_002.ipt located in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Inspect tab, click the AutoLimits Settings button, ensure that all three Default 
Visibility options are enabled, and then click the OK button. This part has a layout sketch 
on which the solid was based. The length has been left undefi ned by creating the visible 
driven dimension. Two AutoLimits have been added. The fi rst alerts you if the distance 
from the front edge to the rectangular cut becomes too thin, and the second alerts you if 
the mass of the part becomes too heavy. To adjust the model, follow these steps:
 
A. Click the sketched point or construction line and drag in or out.
 
B. Use the Update button (select it from the Quick Access bar) to see the edit take place.
 
4. Drag the sketch point out so that the visible dimension is around 470 and click the 
Update button. Note the red square in the middle of the part. This is the Mass AutoLimit, 
indicating that the current length causes the part to be too heavy.
 
5. Drag the sketch point in so that the visible dimension is less than 300 and click the 
Update button. Note the red square on the edge of the part; this is a lower limit, Length 
AutoLimit, indicating that the current overall length causes the width between the rect-
angular cut and the edge of the part to become too thin.

USING AUTOLIMITS | 655
To see these AutoLimits in the browser, you can click the white arrow on the browser bar and 
change from the Model browser to the AutoLimits browser (you might need to use the Refresh 
button on the AutoLimits panel fi rst). Once you’ve explored these existing AutoLimits, you can 
close this fi le without saving the changes and continue to create AutoLimits.
Loading AutoLimit Tools
When you load a ﬁ le that contains existing AutoLimits, the AutoLimits tools are not loaded or dis-
played in that ﬁ le until you use an AutoLimits tool. A quick way of doing this is to use the Refresh 
button on the AutoLimits panel.
Creating AutoLimits
AutoLimits come in three types: Dimensional, Area-Perimeter, and Physical Properties. In the 
following steps, you’ll create a Minimum Distance limit and then defi ne the limit boundaries:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_13a_003.ipt located in the Chapter 13 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. On the Inspect tab, click the AutoLimits Settings button.
 
4. Set all three default settings to On and click the OK button.
 
5. Click the Dimensional button in the AutoLimits panel.
 
6. On the left of the dialog box, click the Minimum Distance AutoLimits button (the last one 
on the bottom).
 
7. For the selections, you can click the edges with work axes running through them, or you 
can click the axes (the axes are not required and have been placed just to help identify the 
correct edges).
 
8. Click the Boundary tab.
 
9. Click the Click To Add bar to place the green target AutoLimit.
 
10. Set the Lower value to 50 mm.
 
11. Rather than setting an Upper value, you will change the USign column so that the Upper 
limit is open-ended. Click the < under USign and choose the blank or empty entry from 
the drop-down.
 
12. You want to add another row to defi ne the lower limits. To do so, hold down the Ctrl key 
and click the Click To Add bar. The new row should appear above the previous row in 
the table.

656 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Setting AutoLimits Boundaries
Hold down Alt and click the Click To Add bar before you add any boundaries. Th is will place all 
ﬁ ve boundary levels at once, allowing you to deﬁ ne the green “target” boundary as well as a yellow 
“warning” and a red “danger” boundary on each side of the target.
Clicking the Click To Add bar always adds an upper boundary unless the green target boundary 
has been set to have no upper value. Clicking the Click To Add bar while holding down the Ctrl key 
always adds a lower boundary unless the green target boundary has been set to have no lower value.
You can add as many ranges as required when using the standard Click To Add or Ctrl+click methods; 
however, you can have only one range (ﬁ ve boundaries) when using the Alt+click method.
 
13. Click the yellow triangle twice slowly in the Level column and change it to the red square 
in the drop-down.
 
14. Set the Upper value to 49.999 mm.
 
15. Change the LSign column so that the lower limit is open-ended. Click the < under LSign 
and choose the blank or empty entry from the drop-down. Your boundary defi nition 
should resemble Figure 13.13.

16. Click the OK button and then click the OK button in the message dialog box.
 
17. You should see a green dot appear on your model; this is your AutoLimit.
 
18. Double-click the Length dimension and change the value to 299 mm.

USING AUTOLIMITS | 657
 
19. Click the Update button (select it from the Quick Access bar) to see the edit take place. 
Note that the AutoLimit displays the red square, indicating that the distance is now 
below the value set as acceptable.
 
20. Change Length Dimension to 300 mm and click Update. Note that the AutoLimit displays 
a gray X. This indicates that there is a gap in the AutoLimit.
 
21. Hover your mouse pointer over the gray X until it changes color; then right-click and 
choose Edit AutoLimits.
 
22. Click the Boundary tab.
 
23. Select the Lower limit for the green row, change 50 mm to 49.9999 mm, and then click 
any other cell. Note that it sets the value back to 50.000 mm.
 
24. Click the OK button to return to the model and note that the AutoLimit is now green, as 
shown in Figure 13.14.
Figure 13.14
Length AutoLimits
AutoLimits are quite simple to set up and use. You can continue experimenting with this fi le 
and create other types of AutoLimits. Then you can close the fi le and continue.
Editing AutoLimits
You can view all the existing AutoLimits in your model by clicking the white arrow on the 
browser bar and changing from the Model browser to the AutoLimits browser. You can edit 
AutoLimits in the AutoLimits browser by selecting an AutoLimits entry and right-clicking it. 
I recommend you set the selection fi lter to Feature Priority because doing so makes it easier to 
select the AutoLimits glyphs. You can copy or delete AutoLimits by right-clicking them in the 
browser and choosing the appropriate command.
You can also create a group of AutoLimits to control the visibility of related AutoLimits. 
To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the top node in the AutoLimits browser and select Create Group.
 
2. Right-click any AutoLimit and choose Copy AutoLimit.
 
3. Right-click the group and choose Paste AutoLimit.
 
4. Right-click the group to toggle visibility.

658 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Don’t Go Crazy with AutoLimits
In an assembly, use only the minimum number of AutoLimits required to monitor just the critical 
design information of interest. Using more than 10 AutoLimits can begin to impact the process-
ing speed of your model. You can use AutoLimits in all environments except the Inventor Studio 
environment, the BIM Exchange, Dynamic Simulation, the construction environment, Solid Edit, 
the Flat pattern environment, and Engineer’s Notebook.
Using the Design Assistant
The Design Assistant helps you fi nd, manage, and maintain Inventor fi les and related docu-
ments, spreadsheets, and text fi les. Imagine your company is evaluating a new design that 
involves making minor changes to an existing design. You would like to reuse the parts, assem-
blies, drawings, and presentations as much as possible. Once you make the required changes 
and fi nish the new design work, you need to send the existing and modifi ed designs to another 
department for their input on the overall design. The Design Assistant and Pack And Go tools 
can help in this scenario. You can perform searches, create fi le reports, and work with links 
across Inventor fi les. In addition, you can preview and view the iProperties.
You can launch the Design Assistant in any of three ways:
 
◆
Within Inventor, while a fi le is open, click the Inventor button and choose Manage ➢ 
Design Assistant.
 
◆
Right-click a fi le in Windows Explorer and select the Design Assistant tool.
 
◆
Select Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Design Assistant 2015.
Managing Files in the Design Assistant
Note that the Manage button will not be visible if you open the Design Assistant from an actively 
open ﬁ le in Inventor. To manage the links, you must open the ﬁ le from the Design Assistant directly 
or via Windows Explorer, and they cannot be open in Inventor while you do this.
The Design Assistant dialog box, shown in Figure 13.15, contains three buttons in the left 
column: Properties, Preview, and Manage. You can open fi les using File ➢ Open. Figure 13.15 
shows the result of selecting File ➢ Open in an assembly named Demote_Stapler.iam. 
The assembly is listed in the left pane, and all parts related to the assembly are listed in the 
right pane.
You can right-click any fi le in the Design Assistant and select View With Inventor View 1.0, 
which launches the Inventor View dialog box, shown in Figure 13.16. In this dialog box, you can 
use view functions such as Zoom, Pan, and Rotate.

Using the Inventor View Dialog Box
Autodesk Inventor View is a lightweight version of Inventor that can be used to view models and 
drawings. You can access it from the Design Assistant or from the Windows Start menu, or you can 
simply right-click a ﬁ le in Windows Explorer and select View With Inventor View. Th is application 
is especially useful for nonengineering users who might need to view and print models and draw-
ings but do not have the authority to edit or create models. Th e program can be downloaded from 
the Autodesk site and installed on a computer without installing Inventor.

660 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
To view the preview in the Design Assistant, you can click the Preview button in the Design 
Assistant dialog box, shown in Figure 13.17. The Design Assistant shows the preview for all the 
fi les. The fi gure shows the preview of the top-level assembly and one of the parts contained in 
the assembly. You can choose any listed fi le to display its preview.

Using the Find Files Tool
You can use the Find Files tool to locate all references to a specifi ed fi le. This can be useful when 
you are trying to determine how an edit, revision, or change order will affect existing designs. 
To use the Find Files tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Manage button in the left column, as shown in Figure 13.18.
 
2. Click the Drawings, Assemblies, and Parts check boxes. These check boxes are located 
next to the text Include Files Of Type in the Design Assistant dialog box (only two are 
shown in Figure 13.18).
 
3. You can check Search Subfolders, shown next to the Parts check box in the Design 
Assistant dialog box, to include subfolders.
 
4. Find Files will fi nd the fi les that use the selected fi le. In Figure 13.18, 300-Channel—
Spring Clip.ipt has been selected, as is shown in the top pane (the .ipt fi le extension 
is not shown), and the referencing fi les found are listed in the bottom pane.
Right-clicking a fi le and selecting iProperties gives you the properties for the selected part or 
assembly without opening the part or assembly in Inventor, as shown in Figure 13.19. Note that 
you do this after clicking the Properties or Preview button; the iProperty option is not available 
from the Manage view.

2. Select options in the Where Used dialog box, such as Parts, Drawings, Include Subfolders, 
and so on.
 
3. Click Search Now.
In the Path area under Look In, you can add paths that you want to search. The Where Used 
tool will list all the fi les where the specifi ed fi le is used in some way. File relationships can 
include but are not limited to derived components and using a part fi le or assembly fi le in an 
assembly, drawing, presentation, and so on. Figure 13.21 shows a Where Used search that has 
been run using the Design Assistant on a fi le in the local Vault workspace. However, the Design 
Assistant is often used without Vault.

Renaming, Copying, and Replacing Files
You can use the Design Assistant to perform management tasks such as renaming, copying, 
and replacing Inventor fi les without breaking the links to the fi les that reference them. This 
is because the Design Assistant not only performs the management task on the fi les but also 
“cracks” the referencing fi les and updates the link to the fi le at the same time. This is the 
fundamental difference between doing these operations in Windows Explorer (generally not 
recommended) and doing them in the Design Assistant.
Renaming Files with the Design Assistant
To rename a fi le that is in an assembly, drawing, or presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Close Inventor.
 
2. Open the assembly, drawing, or presentation fi le in the Design Assistant.
 
3. Click the Manage button. In the Manage browser, click to select the component to be 
renamed. Right-click in the Action column and select Rename. All occurrences of the 
component are highlighted.

USING THE DESIGN ASSISTANT | 663
 
4. Right-click the Name column and select Change Name. In the Open dialog box, 
change the name and select Open (you’re not really opening anything; you are just 
setting the name).
 
5. Click Save to apply the changes.
Copying Files with the Design Assistant
To copy a fi le that is in an assembly, drawing, or presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Close Inventor.
 
2. Open the fi le in the Design Assistant.
 
3. Click the Manage button. In the Manage browser, click to select the component to be 
renamed. Right-click the Action column and select Copy. All occurrences of the compo-
nent are highlighted.
 
4. Right-click the Name column and select Change Name. In the Open dialog box, enter the 
name of the new copy and select Open (you’re not really opening anything; you are just 
setting the name).
 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all the fi les you want to copy. For instance, if you are copying 
a drawing and the part that this drawing details, you would complete steps 3 and 4 for 
both the drawing and the part.
 
6. Click Save to create the copies. Your copies will be created right next to the original fi les.
This technique can be incredibly useful when you want to create a copy of an existing 
detailed design so that you can make changes to the copy. Create the copy of the drawings and 
the components and then make the changes.
Replacing Files with the Design Assistant
If you want to replace a part or assembly fi le with an assembly, you can right-click the Action 
cell and then select Replace. Right-click the Name cell for the component and then click Change 
Name. In the dialog box, select the replacement fi le. After a fi le is replaced, renamed, or copied, 
other fi les that reference the original fi le need an update. The Update option will be useful, as 
shown here:
 
1. Open the assembly fi le in the Design Assistant.
 
2. Click Manage and select fi les that are being modifi ed from the upper browser.
 
3. In the lower browser, select the fi le types you want to include in the update.
 
4. Click Find Files. The referencing fi les are displayed in the lower browser.
 
5. Click the Save button to apply the changes.
The Design Assistant cannot make changes in certain circumstances. For example, it can’t 
make changes when the active project is set to Semi-isolated, when the design state of a fi le is 
set to Released, when read-only permissions are set, or when you’re trying to change the work-
group copy of the fi le.

664 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
The Design Assistant vs. Autodesk Vault
Th e Design Assistant can make many of the changes discussed here, but if you ﬁ nd yourself copy-
ing designs, changing ﬁ lenames, and relinking projects often, you owe it to yourself to investigate 
Autodesk Vault. Vault can do all of these operations and much, much more.
Using Pack And Go
You can use the Pack And Go tool to package an Inventor fi le, such as a top-level drawing 
or assembly, and collect all of its referenced Inventor fi les in a single location. This is a useful 
feature for archiving a design and all the fi les related to the design into a single ZIP fi le. For 
example, suppose you had the following assembly:
 
◆
Assembly1.iam
 
◆
Part1.ipt
 
◆
Part2.ipt
 
◆
Part3.ipt
The problem is that you are not sure what directories the part fi les are in. Pack And Go can 
fi nd all the parts for Assembly1.iam and copy them into a new directory. You can then zip the 
fi les in that new directory to be archived or sent to other users. You can access the Pack And Go 
tool by right-clicking in Microsoft Windows Explorer or from a Design Assistant session started 
outside Inventor. Click the Properties or Preview tab and right-click the assembly to access the 
Pack And Go tool.
To use Pack And Go on an assembly, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Inventor button and choose Save As ➢ Save As Pack And Go. This will open the 
Pack And Go dialog box.
 
2. Set the destination directory to the folder in which you want to copy the fi les.
 
3. If you have multiple project fi les, use the Browse button to ensure that you are looking at 
the proper one.
 
4. Click the More button to display more Pack And Go options, as shown in Figure 13.22 
(once clicked, the More button toggles to the Less button).
 
5. Click Search Now to fi nd the IPT and IAM fi les that are referenced by the assembly fi le. 
They will appear in the Files Found section at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
6. This fi nds all the fi les referenced by the assembly fi le, but what if you know that the 
assembly and part fi les have drawings detailing them? To search for referencing fi les, 
click the Search Now button in the Search For Referencing Files area.
 
7. If fi les are found, you can select which ones to add and then click the Add button. Note 
that there is no progress bar in this dialog box, so you have to watch the top of the 

USING THE DESIGN ASSISTANT | 665
dialog box and wait for “Found # fi le(s)” to appear to know that it is done, as shown in 
Figure 13.23.

8. Click the Start button to start the copying process. Once the fi les are copied, the Cancel 
button turns into a Done button to let you know.

666 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Typically you will want to confi gure some of the options because these will yield different 
Pack And Go results:
Copy To Single Path  This copies the referenced fi les to a single folder, reducing folder hier-
archies. If any fi les have the same fi lename, only one of the fi les can be placed at the destina-
tion folder.
Keep Folder Hierarchy  This preserves the folder hierarchy under the destination folder. 
Use this option for round-trip fi le transfers such as sending fi les to a contract worker or cus-
tomer or when you are packing fi les to work on a laptop while offsite. Maintaining the folder 
hierarchy will allow you to move the fi les back to the original destination smoothly when 
they return.
Model Files Only  This copies only Inventor fi les (with fi lename extensions .iam, .ipt, 
.idw, .dwg, and .ipn) to the destination folder. Referenced fi les such as spreadsheets, embed-
ded pictures, and text fi les are not copied.
Include Linked Files  This includes referenced fi les such as spreadsheets, embedded pic-
tures, and text fi les.
Skip Libraries  When this is selected, all fi les found in a library path, such as Content 
Center fi les and user-defi ned library fi les, are excluded from the Pack And Go tool.
Collect Workgroups  If this is selected, workgroups and the workspace are collected into a 
single folder. This is typically relevant only when working with a legacy project type.
Skip Styles  If this is selected, style XML fi les are not copied with the packaged fi le.
Skip Templates  Templates are not copied with the Pack And Go fi les when this option is 
selected. You can generally use this option and deselect it only for special circumstances.
It is important to note that Pack And Go does not modify the source fi les. When you package 
Inventor fi les, they are copied to the new destination. A log fi le and a copy of the original project 
fi le with a .txt suffi x are also copied to the destination folder. Changes made to the packaged 
fi les do not affect source fi les.
Here are some common uses for Pack And Go:
 
◆
Archiving so that you can package fi les on a CD or DVD.
 
◆
Sending fi les to another user.
 
◆
Separating the referenced fi les from other fi les in the same source folders.
 
◆
Copying an assembly to a new location and then creating a design variant by making 
changes to the copy. The original is unaffected.
Using Pack And Go as a Cleanup Tool
Pack And Go can be useful as a project cleanup tool. Often a project folder will become cluttered 
with numerous unused ﬁ les. Use Pack And Go on the top-level drawing or assembly and copy all 
the ﬁ les to a secondary location. Th en delete the contents of the original folder and replace them 
with the cleaned-up copies.

USING THE DRAWING RESOURCE TRANSFER WIZARD | 667
Pack And Go uses the active project fi le. You can change the active project fi le. If you have 
fi les in multiple locations, the project fi le must specify all those locations.
Using the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard
The Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard helps copy drawing resources such as borders, title 
blocks, and sketched symbols from one source drawing to one or more destination drawings. 
To use the tool, you have to close Inventor just to avoid a situation where you are in the middle 
of modifying a drawing and you want to use that drawing as part of the process for transfer-
ring resources.
For example, imagine your company has hundreds of drawings in Inventor. However, there 
has been a change in the standard note that is on every drawing. If the standard note was cre-
ated as a sketched symbol, this update can be batched. The transfer wizard is an ideal solution 
to solve this kind of problem.
Follow these steps to use the wizard:
 
1. Select Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools ➢ Drawing 
Resource Transfer Wizard.
 
2. On the welcome screen, click Next.
 
3. On the Select Source Drawing And Resources screen, select the drawing template and 
then click the OK button.
 
4. This loads the preview (if available) under Preview and shows the available drawing 
resources hierarchy in the source under Source Resources. You can deselect the resources 
you don’t want to transfer to the destination. Figure 13.24 shows the source drawing 
resources.
Figure 13.24
Selecting 
source drawing 
resources

668 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
 
5. Click Next to go to the Select Target Drawings screen. On this page, select one or more 
drawings (by Shift+clicking) and click Open. You can click the fi le or path column name 
to sort fi les.
 
6. Click Next and select Yes or No for replacing resources in the target fi le with the same 
name as in the source. If you select Yes, the same name is used as the source for the target 
fi le. Selecting No gives a unique name to target drawing resources that have the same 
name as those in the source fi le. For instance, instead of writing over a title block defi ni-
tion named TB_100, you would end up with TB_100 and Copy Of TB_100 in your fi les.
 
7. Click Start, which shows the progress bar and a Pause button to temporarily halt the 
process.
 
8. When the progress bar fi nishes, click Exit to complete the process.
If you have a number of old drawings that you need to bring up-to-date with a new standard, 
this tool is useful.
Using the Wizard for New Title Blocks
A problem that pops up quite often in manufacturing is changing title blocks. Companies change 
addresses, change logos, and get bought or merged; any number of things can happen to require 
you to have to change your title block. Th is is where the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard can 
come in handy. Simply edit the title block as required in your template ﬁ le and then transfer it to 
all your old drawings.
Using the Style Library Manager
A helpful style tool that is external to Inventor is the Style Library Manager. This tool can be used 
to manage style libraries in your template fi les and set up style libraries. You should consider using 
this tool when attempting to remove unwanted styles from templates. You can access it by selecting 
Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools ➢ Style Library Manager.
You can use this tool to copy, rename, and delete style libraries. For example, imagine you are a 
CAD administrator who rolls out all the standards for your company, and you want to ensure that 
a good library of styles exists for others to use. The Style Library Manager comes to the rescue in 
this situation. You can create a new style library using the Create New Style Library button, shown 
in Figure 13.25 under the Style Library 2 column. Any changes in the style library are not available 
in other documents until Inventor closes and a new session is reopened.
You can reuse your styles by copying them from one style library to another. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Style Library Manager tool.
 
2. In Style Library 1, click the drop-down arrow to select the source library styles you want 
to copy or use the Browse button.

USING THE STYLE LIBRARY MANAGER | 669

3. In Style Library 2, you have three options:
 
◆
Choose an existing library.
 
◆
Copy an existing style library.
 
◆
Create an empty style library.
Use the Create New Style Library button to select the last two options or use the Browse 
button to use the fi rst. Figure 13.26 shows a new empty library being created.
Figure 13.26
Creating a new 
style library
 
4. Click one or more styles in Style Library 1 and then click the >> button to add them to 
Style Library 2. Click the arrow buttons to add styles to or remove styles from the desti-
nation as desired.
Creating a new empty library and then bringing in approved styles one at a time is the 
best way to ensure that you a get a clean style library with only the styles you want and 
nothing else.
 
5. In Style Library 1 or 2, you can right-click a style name and select Rename or Delete. 
A warning will appear that all document links to that style will be broken or the style 
will be permanently deleted from the style library. Click Yes to continue and enter a 

670 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
new name. Click No to cancel the Rename or Delete operation. Note that you cannot 
undo or reverse a deletion.
 
6. Changes are saved as you make them. Once all changes have been made, click the Exit 
button.
Using the Task Scheduler
A large design repository needs to have a way to manage tasks for effi ciency and repeatability. 
Nonproductive and mundane tasks tend to be expensive and tedious. The purpose of the Task 
Scheduler is to precisely automate such tasks. To access the Task Scheduler, select Start ➢ All 
Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools ➢ Task Scheduler.
Imagine you are working for a service company that handles outsourcing work for auto sup-
pliers. The supplier works with hundreds of fi les and is trying to decide whether to move to 
Inventor 2015. You have been asked to evaluate this for the supplier. You want to do testing and 
present quantitative data on the results of migration or some other custom tasks the supplier 
normally performs on legacy fi les. The main purpose of the Task Scheduler is to automate the 
tasks and quickly give you results. The Task Scheduler has the ability to create tasks such as 
the following:
 
◆
Migrating a set of fi les from Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Mechanical Desktop, and 
Autodesk Inventor software
 
◆
Converting Inventor IDWs to Inventor DWGs
 
◆
Publishing DWF fi les
 
◆
Importing fi les and exporting fi les
 
◆
Updating parts, assemblies, and drawings
 
◆
Checking out and checking in from Vault
 
◆
Retrieving fi les from Vault
 
◆
Printing sheet sets
 
◆
Refreshing Content Center components used in assemblies
 
◆
Running a custom macro (such as a Visual Basic routine)
 
◆
Creating a single part from an assembly using the Shrinkwrap tool
Creating a Task for Migrating Files
To create a task to migrate fi les in Task Scheduler, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Task Scheduler by selecting Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk 
Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools ➢ Task Scheduler.
 
2. Select Create Task ➢ Migrate Files, as shown in Figure 13.27.
 
3. In the Migrate Files dialog box (see Figure 13.28), enter the task name, frequency, start 
time, and start date. If Immediately is checked, the task will start immediately after you 
click the OK button. The log fi le helps you to see the output of the task.

4. Use one of the three buttons along the top to add fi les in one of the following ways:
Add Files  Select fi les from the active project to add to the task.
Add Folder  Browse to a folder or folders to add to the task. Use the File Name drop-
down to select which fi le type to process. Ensure that the Recursive check box is selected 
to include subfolders.
Add Project  Select a project to include all fi les in that project’s search paths.
 
5. Click the Options button to open the Migration Options dialog box, shown in 
Figure 13.29. The options are also listed here:
Total Rebuild  This rebuilds all the parts and assemblies.
Skip Migrated Files  This ignores fi les created in the current version or fi les already 
migrated.

672 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Skip Files With Unresolved References  This ignores fi les with broken links and 
references.
Include Assembly Graphics For Express Mode  This setting allows you to save Express 
mode graphics in the assembly when migrating assembly fi les. With Express mode 
graphics included, your migrated assemblies can then be opened in Inventor’s Express 
mode. Without these graphics, assembly fi les can be opened only in Full mode.
Set Defer Updates (Drawings Only)  This toggles on the setting that allows drawings 
to be made static so that they do not update as the part or assembly they detail updates. 
This can be toggled off manually from the drawing later.
Make All Raster Drawing Views Precise  This updates drawing views from the draft 
preview of the drawing view (Raster View) to a fully calculated (Precise) drawing view. 
Update Local Materials and Appearances  This updates the material and appearance 
styles found in the fi le to match the material and appearance library styles. 
Purge Old Versions  This deletes former versions after the migration task fi nishes, 
keeping fi le size to a minimum.
Compact Model History  This purges fi le history used for fast feature editing. This is 
intended for working with large assemblies when you experience capacity limitations. 
Do not select this option when migrating fi les to a new release.

6. Click the OK button to run the task. When the task is done, you will see the status shown 
as completed.
Users can run, edit, delete, or disable tasks once they are created, as shown in Figure 13.30. 
Tasks are also saved so they can be run again. You can click the Task ID or Name column to sort 
the data by task ID or name.

USING THE TASK SCHEDULER | 673
Figure 13.30
Editing a task
Performing Sequential Tasks
You can create several subtasks to set up multiple tasks and schedule them to run in a specifi ed 
sequence at a specifi ed time. Custom subtasks can be used also in a sequential task. One subtask 
can depend on the output of the previous subtask. Here are some examples of multiple subtasks:
 
◆
Importing fi les
 
◆
Updating designs
 
◆
Publishing DWF fi les
 
◆
Printing fi les
 
◆
Generating a cost report (custom task)
Performing Custom Tasks
A form of a COM object that implements the COM interface could be a custom task. For 
instance, you can use a custom task to open a batch of text fi les. A type library fi le called 
ServiceModuleInterfaceDef.tlb is shipped with the Task Scheduler. To access the COM 
interface, reference this fi le within your project. You can create custom tasks in any program-
ming language that supports COM.
Tweaking Multi-Process Settings
In the Multi-Process Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 13.31, you can tweak parameters to 
complete batch jobs in less time by leveraging the multiprocess support in the Inventor Task 
Scheduler. Up to 16 processes can be run at the same time. You can set the number of processes 
and the amount of memory to be used. You can fi nd this setting in Task Scheduler by selecting 
Settings ➢ Multiple Process.

Batch Plotting with the Task Scheduler
One of the most powerful uses of the Task Scheduler is to batch-plot a number of drawings. Simply 
select Print Files from the Create Task menu and then select the ﬁ les to be printed. Click Options 
to set the paper size and other print parameters.
Publishing DWF Files and Filenames
If you were to use the Task Scheduler to publish a DWF fi le named MI777.ipt, then that would 
become the destination fi le MI777.ipt.dwf. Some users fi nd this fi lenaming scheme diffi cult 
to accept. The motivation to rename it not as filename.dwf is as follows: If Inventor were to 
produce MI777.dwf from MI777.ipt, it might be overwritten if you have two fi les with the 
same name but different fi le extensions, that is, MI777.ipt and MI777.idw. Therefore, the Task 
Scheduler takes the current fi lename with the extension (such as .ipt or .idw) and appends 
.dwf at the end. There are programs available on the Internet or Windows scripting commands 
to rename fi les from MI777.ipt.dwf to MI777.ipt to fi x the fi lenames.
Using iProperties
Inventor fi les have fi le-specifi c properties known as iProperties. The iProperties dialog box 
helps you specify and view them. You can enter custom data into iProperties, search by those 
fi elds, and update your title blocks and parts lists in drawings and BOMs. You can launch this 
dialog box by clicking the Inventor button and then iProperties or by right-clicking the fi lename 
in the browser and selecting iProperties. Figure 13.32 shows the iProperties dialog box for a 
part. The iProperties dialog box in the parts and assemblies environments contains seven tabs, 
whereas the iProperties dialog box in the drawing environment contains only six tabs (the latter 
is missing the Physical properties tab).
You can also right-click a fi le in Windows Explorer and choose Properties ➢ iProperties to 
add or edit iProperties outside of Inventor. Or from Windows Explorer, right-click a fi le and 
choose Design Assistant to work with fi les outside of Inventor. In the iProperties dialog box, you 
can modify data on the Summary, Project, Status, and Custom tabs. On unsaved fi les, changing 
the iProperties using the Design Assistant could lose unsaved changes. You can save any open 
Inventor fi les before using the Design Assistant to change iProperties.
The various tabs in the iProperties dialog box are as follows:
General  Contains fi elds that cannot be modifi ed by the user.
Summary  Contains fi elds that can be modifi ed by the user, such as Title, Subject, and 
Author.
Project  Contains important fi elds such as Part Number, Revision Number, and Project.
Status  Contains drop-down controls for Part Number, Status, Checked Date, 
and so on.
Custom  Helps defi ne your attributes. These attributes follow the Name, Type, and 
Value format. For example, you can have Name=Department, Type=Text, and 
Value=Design123.

USING IPROPERTIES | 675
Save  Helps you specify whether to save the preview picture of the fi le so that it can be used 
in most “browse for fi le” dialog boxes. You can also specify an image fi le to use for this pre-
view picture.
Physical  Lets you calculate and display the physical properties (area, volume, inertia, and 
so on) for a part or an assembly. The material selected is used to calculate the mass proper-
ties. The Update button on the Physical tab is useful to update the physical properties based 
on changes to your models.
Figure 13.32

with aluminum as 
the material
The Summary, Project, Status, and Custom tabs are used to search fi les to update the BOM 
and parts lists.
Figure 13.32 shows an example of iProperties on a simple part. If this were a multi-body part, 
the mass properties of an individual property could be evaluated by setting the Solid drop-
down to look at just the specifi ed solid.
Also notice the hand icon next to the Mass input box. This indicates that the mass has been 
overridden or manually entered rather than being calculated from the part. The calculator 
icon shown next to the Volume input box indicates that the volume is being calculated from 
the part and will update as changes are made. The Density fi eld cannot be changed in this 

676 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
dialog box. To change the density for this example, select the Manage tab, click Styles Editor, 
and fi nd Aluminum-6061 under Material. Then change the density.
Overriding Mass and Volume for a Simplified Representation
Sometimes you’ll want to model a simpliﬁ ed representation of a part but still need to have an accu-
rate measure of its mass or volume. In these cases, type over the mass or volume in the iProperties 
dialog box. Th e calculator icon will then change to the hand icon, signifying that the mass and/or 
volume has been overridden. To allow Inventor to recalculate the mass or volume, delete all the 
text from the box and click the Update button. Inventor will then compute the mass and volume 
based on the size and density of the model.
Copying iProperties to Drawings
You can copy the model iProperties to the drawing iProperties so that they are the same. Copied 
model iProperties can be used in part lists, title block standard notes, or any annotation that 
accesses the iProperties. If the iProperties are set up in your drawing template, when you place 
views of the model on a new drawing, the selected iProperties are copied to the drawing from 
the source fi le.
Be aware that, once copied, the properties do not update automatically when changed in 
the model. To update the copied model iProperties in the drawing, select the Manage tab (from 
the drawing fi le) and click Update Copied Model iProperties. Note also that a drawing will 
pull properties from only one source. So if you have views of two different models on a single 
drawing, the properties are pulled from the fi rst model from which a view was created. If you 
remove all the views of the fi rst model, the drawing will pull from the second model, but you 
will need to use the Update button to make this happen.
You can copy iProperties from a model fi le to a drawing fi le by following these steps:
 
1. In the Drawing fi le, select the Tools tab and click Document Settings; then select the 
Drawing tab.
 
2. Click the Copy Model iProperty Settings button, which opens the dialog box shown in 
Figure 13.33.
 
3. Select the boxes for the properties you want to copy. You can select the All Properties 
check box at the bottom to copy all the properties.
Creating Expressions with iProperties
If you have a need to create a “stock size” of your parts to be used in your BOM with associativ-
ity to model parameters, you can create and manage expressions for iProperties by using the 
following steps:
 
1. Click the Inventor button and then iProperties, and select the Summary, Project, Status, 
or Custom tab. Then click a fi eld where an expression needs to be created.
 
2. Start with the = sign and type the text. If you want to include parameters or iProperty 
names, simply include them in brackets. A detected expression is denoted by fx. Figure 13.34 

USING IPROPERTIES | 677
shows an expression that concatenates the thickness, width, and length parameters. This is 
the expression used:
= <Thickness> × <Width> × <Length>

dialog box
Figure 13.34
Concatenating text 
and parameters in 
iProperties
The resulting Stock Number property is as follows:
12.000 mm × 38.000 mm × 75.000 mm
 
3. To edit an existing expression, you can right-click the expression and choose Edit 
Expression.
Before creating the expression from parameters, you should visit the Parameters dialog box 
(select the Manage tab and click the Parameters button) and do the following:
 
◆
In the Export Parameter column, click the check box next to all parameters you want to use 
in expressions. If you forget this step, the expressions will not build.
 
◆
In the Equation column, right-click the parameter and choose Custom Property Format. 
The Export parameter must be selected to get this option. Figure 13.35 shows the Custom 

678 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Property Format options. Notice that you can click the option to apply the formatting to 
all comparable parameters. In other words, if it’s a length parameter, set this format for all 
length parameters; if it’s a volume parameter, set this format for all volume parameters; 
and so on.
Figure 13.35
Customizing an 
exported param-
eter format
To promote reuse, create a template fi le with predefi ned expressions for iProperties that lets 
you unify your parts list and other documentation. The Bill Of Materials dialog box provides 
the Property Expression Builder, which helps you create expressions for iProperties as well. You 
can then copy the expression to the parameter fi eld of multiple parts in the Bill Of Materials 
Editor. Using the Bill Of Materials Editor allows you to “reach into” several parts at once and set 
an expression en masse. Figure 13.36 shows an iProperty expression being created in the Bill Of 
Materials Editor.

Working with the Design Assistant and iProperties
You can use the Design Assistant to copy design properties from one Inventor fi le to another. To 
do so, use the following procedure:
 
1. In Inventor, click the Inventor button and choose Manage ➢ Design Assistant.
 
2. In the Design Assistant, select Tools ➢ Copy Design Properties to access the Copy Design 
Properties dialog box.

USING IPROPERTIES | 679
 
3. Set the source fi le in the Copy From box.
 
4. Select the properties to copy.
 
5. Select the destination fi les to receive the properties.
 
6. Click the Copy button.
 
7. If the properties exist in the destination fi le, you are prompted to overwrite them one by 
one; you can choose Yes To All or No To All as well.
 
8. Once the properties are copied, click Done.
 
9. You can then step into the fi les (from Inventor or the Design Assistant) and change the 
values of the copied iProperties as required.
Figure 13.37 shows the custom iProperties of one fi le being copied to another fi le. You can 
refer to the section “Using the Design Assistant” earlier in the chapter to learn more about the 
Design Assistant and iProperties. If the active project is set to Shared or Semi-isolated, you can-
not copy properties to a fi le that is checked out to someone else or into the workgroup version 
of a fi le.
Figure 13.37
Copying custom 
iProperties from 
one ﬁ le to another
Creating Design Property Reports
You can use the Design Assistant to create a design property report that shows the iProperties 
you’ve selected. The report is written out to a TXT fi le. In the properties view browser in the 
Design Assistant, you can select the design properties to display for fi les:
 
1. While in the properties view, select View ➢ Customize in the Design Assistant and select 
the required property group.
 
2. Select the properties to display. Clicking the Add or Remove button helps you move a 
property from the Available Properties list to the Selected Properties list. You could also 
double-click it. The Name property is a default property that is mandatory in all displays.

680 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
 
3. To include custom properties that you’ve created yourself, follow these steps:
 
A. Set the Property Group drop-down to Custom Properties.
 
B. Click the New button.
 
C. Expand the Add New Property column using the >> button.
 
D. Use Ctrl or Shift to select multiple properties.
 
E. Click Apply. Note that only nine properties may be listed.
 
4. Click Done. Notice that the properties you selected are now listed as columns.
 
5. Select Tools ➢ Reports and choose the report type you want:
Hierarchy Report  Shows the hierarchy within the selected folder or assembly. If a fold-
er is selected, the report shows the subfolders it contains. If an assembly fi le is selected, 
the report shows the paths for the fi les in the assembly.
Design Property Report  Shows values of the specifi ed properties for the fi les in the 
selected fi le or group of fi les.
 
6. Choose the number of levels to display and click Next.
 
7. Specify the report name and save location.
Using the Measure Tools
The Measure tools let you measure distances, angles, loops, and areas. These tools, shown in 
Figure 13.38, are available by selecting the Inspect tab and then looking on the Measure panel. 
They are available in the assemblies, parts, sheet-metal, fl at pattern, construction, and 2D and 
3D sketch environments. You can select sketches, edges, faces, bodies, and work geometry to 
take measurements. In addition to the measurement tools mentioned, you can use Measure 
Regions while in a 2D sketch.
Figure 13.38
Measure tools
Distance  Lets you measure the length of a line, an arc, or the distance between points 
and so on.
Angle  Lets you measure the angle between points, edges, or two lines. To measure between 
points, click two points to defi ne a line and then a third point to measure the angle.
Loop  Gives you the length of the loops. For 2D sketches, it measures open or closed loops. 
For 3D sketches, it measures only open loops.
Area  Gives you the area of closed regions.
Region Properties  Calculates the area, perimeter, and the area moment of inertia proper-
ties of 2D sketch loops. Measurements are taken from the sketch coordinate system.

USING THE MEASURE TOOLS | 681
Using Measurement Helpers
Measurements can be accumulated, cleared, and displayed in different ways. Figure 13.39 shows 
some of the options that are useful while using the Measure tools. 
Figure 13.39
Measurement 
helpers
Add To Accumulate  Adds the current measurement to the total sum
Clear Accumulate  Resets the sum to zero
Display Accumulate  Displays the current sum
Dual Unit  Lets you see the measurement in the desired units
Precision  Displays eight formatting values and the option to display all decimals
One of the advantages of using the Measure tools is the ability to enter feature parameters by 
measuring instead of by directly entering them. For example, in Figure 13.40, extrusion depth 
can be entered as a known value. Alternatively, you can select the Measure tool from the Depth 
fl yout and then select a model edge. The length of the edge will appear in the Depth control of 
the Extrude dialog box. This is a convenient way to input dimensions by measuring instead of 
directly entering the values into the dialog box. In the graphics window, click the geometry to 
measure. The measurement is transferred to the dialog box automatically. Note that this tool can 
be used with sketch dimensions as well.
Figure 13.40
Measure tool and 
feature parameters

682 | CHAPTER 13 TOOLS OVERVIEW
Also shown in Figure 13.40 is the Show Dimensions option. Choosing this option allows you 
to select an existing feature to temporarily see the consumed dimensions within that feature. 
You can then select a dimension on-screen to link the value of that dimension to the dimension 
you are currently entering. This differs from the Measure method in that the value will update 
if the object changes, whereas the measured value will stay static.
Measuring in Assemblies
Since you have faces and components in assemblies, there is a need to differentiate measuring 
between them. In the context menu, you can change the selection priority.
When Component Priority is selected, the minimum distance is measured between subas-
semblies. Part priority signifi es measurement between parts only. Faces And Edges Select 
Priority lets you select only faces and edges, which is the default when nothing is preselected. 
Changing the selection priority resets any existing selections. Figure 13.41 shows the priority 
type pull-down with the selection fi lters for Component, Part, and Faces/Edges.
Figure 13.41
Selection priority 
for measurements
You can measure preselected entities by selecting the object fi rst and then clicking the 
Measure button. If a selection set is valid for a measurement, the select fi lter in the Measure dia-
log box is updated, and the measurement is displayed. For example, if you select two points and 
then start the Measure Distance tool, you will get the distance between the points. However, if 
you select three points and start the Measure Angle tool, the selection set is cleared because the 
tool doesn’t know which point is the vertex of the angle.
Participating in the CIP and CER
The Customer Involvement Program (CIP) aids in collecting information about your use of the 
Inventor software. Customer error reporting (CER) aids in sending information to Autodesk 
when the software program closes unexpectedly.
Participating in the CIP
To guide the direction of the Autodesk design software in the future, your use of the Inventor 
software is forwarded to Autodesk if you participate in the CIP. You can access this feature by 
selecting Help ➢ Customer Involvement Program. In the Customer Involvement Program dialog 
box, you can select a level of participation and then click the OK button. The following informa-
tion might be collected:
 
◆
Autodesk product version and name
 
◆
Inventor commands and time spent
 
◆
Error conditions (catastrophic and nonfatal)
 
◆
Information such as system confi guration, IP address, and so on

USING MISCELLANEOUS TOOLS | 683
The CIP is committed to privacy protection. It can collect neither drawing or design data nor 
personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers. It will not contact users 
by email or any other way. The Customer Involvement Program aids in letting Autodesk know 
about the most commonly used tools and features, the most common problem areas, and so on. 
You can stop participation at any time by accessing the controls from the Autodesk Help menu. 
Your system administrator can also choose to block the CIP.
Participating in CER
Customer error reporting is a process by which Inventor users can report crashes to Autodesk. 
A software crash happens when the software program closes unexpectedly. When you have 
an unexpected error, Inventor shows a dialog box, and you can choose to send the error to 
Autodesk. CER records the subset of the code that was in use before the crash. The CER report 
collects a variety of information, such as the following:
 
◆
Operating system and graphics driver name, version, and confi guration
 
◆
Autodesk software name and version
 
◆
List of recently used Autodesk commands
 
◆
Lines in the code where the crash happened
You can enter the step-by-step process that led to the crash. In addition, you can include your 
email and contact information. The error data is sent to Autodesk using a secure Internet con-
nection in an encrypted form. If you have concerns about security and personal confi dential 
information being sent to Autodesk, please do not send the customer error report.
At Autodesk, an automated system sorts the reports based on the code call stack so that 
the Autodesk development teams can analyze them. Each set of reports is prioritized based 
on the number of users having the same issue and how often the problem happens. If there is no 
current update, Autodesk will use that information for a future update or major release. When 
the issue is fi xed, it is included in either a future maintenance update or a future release of the 
product. Customers who reported the error are notifi ed. If there is a current update (immediate 
update notifi cation), it is immediately sent to the customer. If not (delayed update notifi cation), 
customers are notifi ed when their error is addressed in a future software update.
Using Miscellaneous Tools
In the following sections, I will cover some miscellaneous tools: the Inventor Multi-Sheet Plot, 
the Add-In Manager, and the Project Editor. The tools are available by choosing either Start ➢ All 
Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 or Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk 
Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools. If you fi nd that you are using these tools often, it may be helpful to create 
a desktop shortcut to them.
Using the Autodesk Multi-Sheet Plot Tool
The Autodesk Multi-Sheet Plot tool opens the dialog box shown in Figure 13.42. It allows you to 
print one or more drawing sheets of various sizes. Clicking Next takes you to another dialog box 
that allows you to select drawings. Once the drawings are selected, you can schedule to print 
the multi-sheet. This tool helps you reduce paper usage and reduce plot setup time. Besides, 
it optimizes sheet layout on a selected paper size that you can print directly or save as a batch

Using the Add-In Manager
The Add-Ins button opens an Add-In Manager dialog box that lets you select the add-ins you 
want to load or unload when Inventor starts. You can access this tool by choosing Start ➢ All 
Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools or, when in Inventor, by selecting the 
Tools tab and clicking the Add-Ins button on the Options panel. Once the Add-In Manager dia-
log box is open, click the add-in in the Available Add-Ins area, and at the bottom of the dialog 
box under Load Behavior, deselect the Loaded/Unloaded option to unload it.
Using the Add-In Manager to Speed Inventor Load Time
If there are add-ins you know you do not use, you can use the Add-In Manager to prevent them from 
loading when Inventor loads. Th is will slightly speed up the load time (and reduce the amount of 
RAM Inventor uses). Be sure you understand what speciﬁ c add-ins do because some are required 
for the proper operation of the software.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 685
Using the Project Editor
Selecting the Project Editor tool opens a dialog box for the Inventor Project Editor. This is similar 
to the dialog box that opens after you select the Get Started tab and click Projects in Inventor. You 
can select each project, make changes to it, and save it without having to open Inventor. You can 
access this tool by choosing Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ Autodesk Inventor 2015 ➢ Tools 
or by right-clicking any IPJ fi le from Windows Explorer and choosing Edit. Project fi les can also 
be edited from within Inventor by selecting the Get Started tab and clicking the Projects button.
Th e Bottom Line
Take your models from Inventor to the Autodesk Building Systems program.  If you 
frequently need to take your Inventor models to ABS, BIM Exchange can help you in this pro-
cess with three simple steps. Inventor provides a variety of ways to simplify the model and 
author it. Such models can be published in ABS.

Chapter 14
Exchanging Data with Other 
Systems
Many Autodesk® Inventor® users need to bring fi les created by other CAD applications into 
Inventor or need to export fi les from Inventor to other formats. For instance, if you design com-
ponents that others use in their designs, you might need to output fi les to a standard format so 
that others can use them with a different software package. Or, if you are a manufacturing “job 
shop,” you may receive many different fi le formats from customers that you need to bring into 
Inventor.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

Import and export geometry
 
◆
Use Inventor fi le translators
 
◆
Work with imported data
 
◆
Work with Design Review markups
Importing and Exporting Geometry
Essentially, three data types make up a 3D model: curves (or wires), surfaces, and solids. Wire-
frame models are composed of only wires that defi ne the size and shape but lack volume. A 
surface model, on the other hand, is composed of wires and faces that defi ne the surfaces but 
still lacks a solid fi lled volume. A solid model is composed of wires and faces that defi ne sur-
faces that in turn defi ne the solid fi lled volume. Understanding the hierarchy of geometry data 
will help you understand the issues that can occur when translating from one of these data 
types to another.
There are different ways in which wires and curves are defi ned. If you are translating fi les 
that represent wires and curves as Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to a format that 
represents wires and curves as simpler basis splines (B-splines), there might be something lost 
in translation. Likewise, when you translate a surface model, if the surface normal direction 
were to get reversed (think positive vs. negative), you will have translation issues. And so it is 
with translating solids; if a solid model is translated so that a gap is formed where two surfaces 
meet, then translation may not be complete.
Translation of curves, surfaces, and solids occurs between different software packages 
because these packages use different methods of geometric accuracy. Accuracy controls such 
things as how close two points in space are before being considered a single point or how close 
two edges can be before they are considered connected, and so on.

688 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
To help with translating from one software package that solves curves using method A to 
software that uses method B, you can create an intermediate, or neutral, fi le. Some common 
neutral fi le formats are Initial Graphic Exchange Specifi cation (IGES), Standard for the Exchange 
of Product (STEP), and Standard ACIS Text (SAT), among others. Other common translations 
include importing fi les from Autodesk® AutoCAD® and Autodesk® Mechanical Desktop® soft-
ware into Inventor. In these cases, you will be working with the DWG fi le type.
Working with Neutral File Formats
Although using neutral formats will help avoid problems, keep two things in mind when translat-
ing ﬁ les:
 
◆
Generally speaking, you should strive to keep the number of ﬁ le formats between the source 
software and the destination software as low as possible.
 
◆
Not all neutral ﬁ le formats are created equal.
Translating DWG and DXF Files
When a DXF or DWG fi le is imported into Inventor, the fi le is translated into an Autodesk 
Inventor part, assembly, and/or drawing fi le, based on the import settings and the geometry 
present in the original fi le. When imported, the original DXF or DWG fi le is not changed; 
instead, the data is created in a new Inventor fi le or multiple Inventor fi les. When exported from 
Inventor to a DWG, a fi le is translated into AutoCAD objects and a new DWG fi le is created. 
The new translated DWG is not linked to the Inventor fi le from which it was created. Instead, 
the DWG data is fully editable within AutoCAD. You can use the fi le mi_14a_014.dwg in the 
Chapter 14 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to explore the import options 
for DWG fi les.
The process of translating DXF and DWG fi les follows similar steps. To import a DWG fi le, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click Open on the Get Started tab.
 
2. Set the Files Of Type drop-down to AutoCAD DWG Files (*.dwg).
 
3. Select the DWG fi le you are going to import.
 
4. Click the Options button and choose Import. (If you are translating a number of 
DWG fi les, you can set Import to be the default by clicking the Tools tab, selecting the 
Application Options button, and choosing the Drawing tab.)
 
5. Once you’ve selected Import, as shown in Figure 14.1, click the OK button.

6. This returns you to the Open dialog box, where you will click the Open button to start 
the DWG/DXF File Wizard. Note the Confi guration drop-down box.
 
7. If you have an import confi guration already saved, you can specify it now and click 
Finish. If you have not yet created a confi guration template, click Next to go to the Import 
Destination Options dialog box.
You need to consider a number of options when importing DWG fi les, depending on the 
DWG data input and the intended translation output. The following sections discuss these con-
siderations in relation to the import options.
Layers and Objects Import Options
Once you click Next in the DWG/DXF File Wizard screen, you will be presented with the Layers 
And Objects Import Options screen. On this screen you can select which layers or objects to 
include or exclude for importing. These two methods of selection are available:
Select By Layer  Use the check boxes to control which layers will be imported. Unchecking 
a layer will exclude all objects located on that layer.
Select By Object  Uncheck the All check box and then select objects in the Import Preview 
window.
You can combine layer and object selections in order to create a specifi c selection set. Once 
the layers and objects are selected, you can click the Next button to continue to the Import 
Destination Options screen.

690 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
Importing D Solids
Once you’ve selected the layers and objects to be imported, you will be presented with the 
Import Destination Options screen. If the AutoCAD DWG has 3D solids, you can check the 
3D Solids check box to translate them into Inventor part fi les. Use the Solids To Single Part 
File check box if you want multi-body solids to be translated into an Inventor part fi le. Leave 
this option unchecked if you want each solid body in the DWG to be created as an individual 
Inventor part fi le and automatically placed in an Inventor assembly. Figure 14.2 shows the 
import options for 3D solids.
Figure 14.2
3D data options
Set the destination folder to a path in which you want to have the part fi les created and 
choose Use Default File Names to allow Inventor to name the resulting part fi les automatically. 
If you choose this option, the new Inventor parts will be given a name based on the DWG name 
and be incremented by a value of 1.
For instance, if the DWG is named Engine.dwg, then the solids in the DWG will be named 
Engine1.ipt, Engine2.ipt, Engine3.ipt, and so on. If Use Default File Names is left 
unchecked, each solid in the DWG will be named Part1.ipt, Part2.ipt, Part3.ipt, and so on.
Importing D Data
If the DWG contains a combination of 3D and 2D data that you want to import, you can set the 
options in the Destination For 2D Data area to handle the 2D data. If the DWG has only 2D data 
or has both but you want to import only the 2D data, then you can leave the 3D Solids check box 
deselected and set only the Destination For 2D Data area of the Import Destination Options dia-
log box, as shown in Figure 14.3. Selecting the New Drawing radio button translates the DWG 
data to a new Inventor DWG or IDW. If you check Promote Dimensions To Sketch, the 2D data is 
placed in a draft view that is created in the Inventor drawing.

Importing Title Blocks and Borders
You can use the Title Block and Border radio buttons to convert an AutoCAD title block DWG 
into an Inventor title block or border. When you do this, be sure to click the Mapping Options 
button (located in the lower-left corner of the dialog box) to set the layer and font mapping 
options shown in Figure 14.4. You can click the Symbol radio button to translate the 2D data into 
a sketched symbol for use in an Inventor DWG or IDW fi le.

Importing AutoCAD Blocks as Sketched Symbols
To import AutoCAD blocks as Inventor sketched symbol defi nitions, you can use the Symbol 
radio button. This can provide a quick way to convert common drawing symbols for use in your 
Inventor drawing templates.
Importing AutoCAD Part Drawings as New Inventor Parts
Click the New Part radio button to translate AutoCAD 2D data into a new IPT sketch to be used 
for the creation of a new part model. Choose to create either a 3D or 2D sketch within the fi le, 
depending on the type of geometry needed.
Inventor has both a decimal and a fractional unit style for dimensions. When dimensions are 
translated, if Inventor detects that the AutoCAD fi le employs a scientifi c, decimal, engineering, 
or Windows desktop style, those styles are converted to decimal style. AutoCAD fraction and 
architectural styles are mapped to Inventor fractional style.
Think Before Importing AutoCAD Geometry
Although you might be tempted to import 2D AutoCAD geometry and start extruding away, you 
do need to keep a few things in mind. If this is a part that will never change, or if it is a reference 
part, this approach is probably ﬁ ne. However, if you are re-creating old AutoCAD data to be used 
in your Inventor models as part of a fully parametric design, you might consider modeling the 
parts from scratch. It will take longer, no doubt. However, modeling from scratch allows you to 
place the design intent into the parts, which you simply cannot do by importing. You can create 
the model in a proper order, and with the proper constraints, that will allow you or others to easily 
modify it in the future.

692 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
Units, Templates, Constraints, and Configurations
Whether importing to 2D or 3D, you will use the Templates area to specify which template to 
use for each of the fi le types to translate to. In the Import Files Units area, you can specify the 
units if they do not match the units that Inventor detects from the AutoCAD fi le. The detected 
unit is based on the INSUNITS system variable in the DWG fi le.
You can use the Constrain End Points and Apply Geometric Constraints check boxes to allow 
Inventor to place constraints on sketch entities when it can. Endpoints found to be coincident 
will be given Coincident constraints, lines found to be parallel will be given parallel constraints, 
and so on.
Once all these options are confi gured, you can click the Save Confi gurations button, shown 
in Figure 14.5, to write out a fi le to use the next time you convert a DWG fi le. Doing this allows 
you to convert fi les more accurately and more quickly.
Figure 14.5
More import desti-
nation options
When all the confi guration settings have been made and saved, click Finish to start the 
import process. Inventor will create the new fi les based on your confi gurations and leave the 
fi les open in the current Inventor session.
Mechanical Desktop DWG
Autodesk Mechanical Desktop (MDT) was a 3D parametric modeler similar to Inventor that 
was developed on top of the existing AutoCAD platform. Once Inventor was created, Autodesk 
stopped developing MDT and has since discontinued support for it. If you have fi les that were 
created using MDT, they can be translated to Inventor part and assembly fi les. If the source 
fi les contain geometry or features that are not recognized in Inventor, they are omitted, and 
the missing data is noted in the browser or the translation log fi le. No links are maintained to 
the existing MDT fi les. You must have MDT on your computer to import fi les into Inventor. 
Note that the AutoCAD Inventor suite does not ship with MDT. If you have a need to use MDT 
for translation, you can download the last version that Autodesk released, MDT 2009, from the 
Autodesk website, or you can purchase or request installation media. 

IMPORTING AND EXPORTING GEOMETRY | 693
MDT’s native fi le format was the DWG fi le, and you can import MDT DWG fi les using the 
Options button in the Open dialog box just as you would a regular DWG. However, if Inventor 
detects that it is an MDT fi le, you are given the option to read the data as an MDT fi le or as an 
AutoCAD or AutoCAD Mechanical fi le, as shown in Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6
Reading MDT ﬁ le 
contents
Although many of the options for templates, units, and confi guration settings are the same as 
previously described for regular DWG fi les, the assembly and part options are specifi c to MDT 
fi les, as shown in Figure 14.7.
Figure 14.7
MDT assembly and 
part options
Consider the following items when migrating MDT fi les to Inventor:
 
◆
Broken views, base section views, and breakout section views from MDT will be turned 
into base views.
 
◆
Exploded views will become unexploded views (no tweaks applied).
 
◆
Importing discards (AMPARDIMS) from MDT automatically creates associative model 
dimensions in Inventor.
 
◆
If Move With Parent is selected in an MDT fi le, Inventor aligns all views according to the 
view type.
 
◆
If a parent view is missing in an MDT fi le, a child view is not created in Inventor.
 
◆
Inventor centerlines and center marks are automatically generated during translation; 
therefore, they might not be the same as in the MDT fi le.
 
◆
Radial section views have broken alignment in Inventor.

694 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
In addition to importing MDT fi les one at a time, you can use the Inventor Task Scheduler 
to batch the translation from MDT to Inventor. It is important to ensure that the MDT fi les are 
migrated to the latest version of MDT before attempting to translate them into Inventor fi les.
STEP and IGES
Standard for the Exchange of Product (STEP) and Initial Graphic Exchange Specifi cation (IGES) 
are nonproprietary fi le formats you can write data to in order to exchange data among propri-
etary software. When a STEP or IGES fi le is opened in Inventor, one part fi le will be created if 
the fi le contains only one part body; otherwise, you can create multiple Inventor part fi les placed 
within an assembly fi le.
Although no links are maintained between the original STEP or IGES fi le and the Inventor 
fi les created from them, when importing an updated STEP or IGES fi le, Inventor updates the 
geometry and maintains all modeling constraints and features applied to that STEP or IGES fi le. 
You can use the fi les called mi_14a_014.stp and mi_14a_014.igs located in the Chapter 14 
directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to explore the import options for STEP and 
IGES fi les.
To import a STEP or IGES fi le, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Open on the Get Started tab and set the Files Of Type drop-down to STEP Files 
(*.stp, *.ste, *.step) or IGES Files (*.igs, *.ige, *.iges).
 
2. Select the fi le you intend to import.
 
3. Click the Options button, and you will be presented with the Import Options dialog.
In the Import Options dialog, you can choose from three save options:
Save In Workspace  Writes the fi les to the Workspace folder defi ned in your current project 
fi le. The fi les are saved as Inventor fi les during the import process.
Select Save Location  Allows you to specify where the resulting Inventor fi les will be saved. 
If the translated fi le contains separate solid bodies, you can confi gure the import to save 
those fi les to one location and the top-level assembly fi le to another location.
Save At Import File Location  Writes the resulting Inventor fi le(s) to the same location as 
the original fi le. Figure 14.8 shows the import save options.

IMPORTING AND EXPORTING GEOMETRY | 695
In the Translation Report area, choose to embed the report in the imported 3D model fi le 
(it will be placed as a node in the browser), or choose to save the report to disk. Note that you 
can choose both of these options or deselect them both in order to skip saving the translation 
report altogether.
In the Entity Types To Import area, use the selection buttons to specify the inclusion of sol-
ids, surfaces, wires, and points in the import action. Click the Import Assembly As Single Part 
check box to turn a multi-body STEP or IGES into a single-part fi le. Then choose from one of two 
options:
Single Composite Feature  This option allows you to import the assembly as a single com-
posite feature into a single-part fi le.
Multiple Solid Part  With this option, you can import the assembly as individual solid bod-
ies into a single-part fi le.
The Import Into Repair Environment option checks the model for errors and creates a repair 
node in the browser. You can edit, diagnose, and repair imported base bodies in the repair 
environment.
Click the Import Multiple Solid Parts As Assembly check box to turn a multi-body STEP or 
IGES into individual part fi les. When imported, the new Inventor parts will be given a name based 
on the fi lename and incremented by a value of 1. For instance, if an IGES were named 4278_T.igs, 
then the Inventor parts will be named 4278_T 1.ipt, 4278_T 2.ipt, 4278_T 3.ipt, and so on.
If you leave both of those check boxes deselected, you can specify how surface objects will be 
translated:
Individual Surface Bodies  Imports surfaces as individual surfaces in a single-part fi le.
Single Composite Feature  Imports surfaces as a single composite in a single-part fi le.
Multiple Composite Features  Imports surfaces as multiple composites all contained in a 
single-part fi le. Composites are created for each level, layer, or group, according to the Create 
From information specifi ed.
A composite is a collection of surfaces, as opposed to a single quilt of surfaces. A composite 
can consist of any combination of single- or multiple-faced surfaces or closed volume surfaces. 
Often these surfaces will not be connected, even if they appear to be. Composites can be used 
when many surfaces are imported as an expedient way of getting surface data into Inventor for 
reference or inspection.
You can also specify which units the imported geometry will be converted to and the post-
process options, as listed here:
Check Parts During Load  This option performs a quality check on the imported data. Bad 
data is marked with a symbol in the browser and any remaining data is not checked. If the 
parts are determined not to have any errors, they are marked with a green check mark in the 
browser. Checking parts can signifi cantly increase the time required to translate a fi le.

696 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
Auto Stitch  This option stitches surfaces into a quilt or solid, when possible. If the stitch 
results in a single body, it is promoted out of the construction environment; otherwise, it 
remains in the construction environment.
Enable Advanced Healing  This option allows small alterations in the surface geometry in 
order to stitch the surfaces.
Figure 14.9 shows the STEP and IGES options.
Figure 14.9
STEP or IGES 
import options
Many Inventor users prefer to send and receive STEP fi les to and from vendors or clients 
because they fi nd that STEP fi les import better than other fi le formats such as IGES. Here is a list 
of attributes that make STEP a popular choice:
 
◆
STEP fi les can retain the original part names when importing to an assembly.
 
◆
STEP creates instances for duplicated parts. If you are sent a STEP of an assembly created 
in another software package and that assembly has 12 instances of a certain screw size, 
Inventor will typically create just one fi le for the screw and instance it 12 times instead of 
creating 12 different fi les.
 
◆
STEP fi les can maintain assembly hierarchy, meaning that subassembly structure can be 
translated. In other formats, assemblies may be translated with all parts at the top-level 
assembly.
 
◆
STEP translates part colors, whereas other formats generally do not contain the informa-
tion needed to carry part colors across different platforms.
 
◆
STEP format is governed independently and is not tied to a particular modeling kernel; as 
a result, it is often considered a more standard format.
To export a fi le as a STEP, click the Inventor button and then select Save Copy As. In the 
resulting dialog box, set Save As Type to STEP Files (*.stp, *.ste, *.step). Click the Options button 
to set the STEP version. You can also choose to include sketches. Included sketches are trans-
lated to the STEP fi le in named groups.

IMPORTING AND EXPORTING GEOMETRY | 697
To export a fi le as an IGES, click the Inventor button, select Save Copy As, and set Save As 
Type to IGES Files (*.igs, *.ige, *.iges). Click the Options button to set the IGES output to either 
surfaces or solids. You can choose to include sketches. Included sketches are translated to the 
IGES fi le in named layers.
SAT
Standard ACIS Text (SAT) fi les are written in the standard fi le exchange format for the ACIS 
solid modeling kernel. You can use the fi le mi_14a_014.sat located in the Chapter 14 directory 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder to explore the import options for SAT fi les. To import 
a SAT fi le, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Open on the Get Started tab.
 
2. Set the Files Of Type drop-down to SAT Files (*.sat).
 
3. Select the fi le you want to import.
 
4. Click the Options button, and you will be presented with the Import Options dialog box.
In the Import Options dialog box, you can choose from three save options:
Save In Workspace  Writes the fi les to the Workspace folder defi ned in your current proj-
ect fi le (see Chapter 1, “Getting Started,” for more on projects and workspaces). The fi les are 
saved as Inventor fi les during the import process.
Select Save Location  Allows you to specify where the resulting Inventor fi les will be saved. 
If the translated fi le contains separate solid bodies, you can confi gure the import to save 
those fi les to one location and the top-level assembly fi le to another location.
Save At Import File Location  Writes the resulting Inventor fi le(s) to the same location as 
the original fi le.
In the Entity Types To Import area, use the selection buttons to specify the inclusion of solids, 
surfaces, and wires in the import action.
The Import Into Repair Environment option checks the model for errors and creates a repair 
node in the browser. You can edit, diagnose, and repair imported base bodies in the repair 
environment.
Use the Import As Single Part check box option to turn a multi-body SAT into a single-part 
fi le. Then choose from one of two options:
Single Composite Feature  Imports the assembly as a single composite feature into a single-
part fi le
Multiple Solid Part  Imports the assembly as individual solid bodies into a single-part fi le If 
you leave this check box deselected, you can specify how surface objects will be translated:
Individual Surface Bodies  Imports surfaces as individual surfaces in a single-part fi le
Single Composite Feature  Imports surfaces as a single composite in a single-part fi le
Some CAD software outputs SAT fi les in a default unit without regard for the units used to 
create the original fi le. You can specify the units to which the imported geometry will be con-
verted as well as the postprocess options listed here.

698 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
Check Parts During Load  This option performs a quality check on the imported data. Bad 
data is marked with a symbol in the browser, and any remaining data is not checked. If the 
parts are determined not to have any errors, they are marked with a green check mark in the 
browser. Checking parts can signifi cantly increase the time required to translate fi les.
Auto Stitch  This option stitches surfaces into a quilt or solid, when possible. If the stitch 
results in a single body, it is promoted out of the construction environment; otherwise, it 
remains in the construction environment.
Enable Advanced Healing  This option allows small alterations in the surface geometry in 
order to stitch the surfaces.
To export a fi le as SAT, click the Inventor button, choose Save Copy As, and set Save As Type 
to SAT Files (*.sat). Click the Options button to set the SAT version. The default is version 7.0. You 
can also choose to include sketches. Included sketches are translated to the SAT ungrouped.
Watch for SAT File Versions
As of Inventor release 5.3, Autodesk broke away from the ACIS SAT standard when it created its 
ShapeManager kernel. Th is means that Inventor cannot read in any SAT ﬁ le that is newer than 
version 6.0. Keep this in mind when requesting models from third parties or when downloading 
them from a vendor’s website.
Using Inventor File Translators
With Inventor, you can access fi les from other CAD systems without downloading an add-in or 
translating the fi les to an intermediate format such as STEP, IGES, or SAT. Instead, you simply 
open the fi le, and Inventor will translate the fi le into an Inventor fi le on the fl y. You can translate 
all of the fi le types in the following list by clicking Open on the Get Started tab and then setting 
the Files Of Type drop-down to the appropriate type. Once the fi le type is selected, click the 
Option button to confi gure the import options.

The Import Into Repair Environment option checks the model for errors and creates a repair 
node in the browser. You can edit, diagnose, and repair imported base bodies in the repair 
environment.
For each of these fi le types, you can specify the units to which the imported geometry will be 
converted as well as the postprocess options listed here:
Check Parts During Load  This option performs a quality check on the imported data. Bad 
data is marked with a symbol in the browser, and any remaining data is not checked. If the 
parts are determined not to have any errors, they are marked with a green check mark in the

IDF Board Files
Intermediate Data Format (IDF) is the standard data exchange format for transferring printed 
circuit assembly (PCA) fi les between printed circuit board (PCB) layouts and mechanical design 
programs. You can access IDF board fi les by clicking Open on the Get Started tab and setting 
the Files Of Type drop-down to IDF Board Files (*.brd, *.emn, *.bdf, and *.idb).
IDF board fi les can be imported into Inventor as assembly or part fi les. When brought in 
as an assembly, board components are translated into individual parts contained in the new 
assembly. When imported as a part, the board components are translated into sketches and fea-
tures. Inventor will translate IDF outlines, keepouts, group areas, drilled holes, and components.
Part fi les are automatically named based on the information in the existing board fi le. Once 
imported, the fi les can be placed into Inventor assemblies and detailed in Inventor drawings just 
as you would any other Inventor model. Figure 14.10 shows the IDF import options. You are pre-
sented with this dialog box automatically when you open an IDF board fi le.
You can use the fi le mi_14a_014.brd located in the Chapter 14 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder to explore the import options for IDF fi les.
Placing Components from Other CAD Systems
So far, you have learned about importing and translating fi les into Inventor using the Open 
dialog box to convert them into Inventor fi les. You can also access most of these fi le types in 
the assembly environment and place them straight into your Inventor assembly fi le just as you 
would any other model.

WORKING WITH IMPORTED DATA | 703
Figure 14.10
Importing an IDF 
board ﬁ le
To place a non-Inventor component into an Inventor assembly, click the Place Components 
icon in the Assembly panel. In the Open dialog box, select the fi le type of the component you 
intend to place or set the fi le type to All Files. Select the fi le and then click the Options button. 
Confi gure the options as required and click the OK button. Click Open to translate and place the 
component into the assembly.
Configuring Your System to Translate Automatically
Depending on how you work with translated ﬁ les, you might want to conﬁ gure your system to 
automatically translate other CAD formats to Inventor ﬁ les when they are accessed. For instance, 
if you use a lot of supplier content from a website that downloads in the form of STEP ﬁ les, you 
could set up Inventor to be the default application to open STEP ﬁ les. To do so, right-click a STEP 
ﬁ le in Windows Explorer and choose Open With and then choose Default Program. In the result-
ing dialog, choose Inventor or click the Browse button and browse for Inventor. Now when you 
double-click a STEP ﬁ le, it will automatically be translated and opened as an Inventor ﬁ le with the 
last set of options you used.
Working with Imported Data
In a perfect world, you would not need to import or export data at all. Instead, all fi les would 
exist in one perfect, universal fi le format. Of course, this perfect world does not exist, and you 

704 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
are probably required to import fi les created in another program from time to time. In a near-
perfect world, imported data would always come in healthy and without any problems. But that 
is rarely the case.
Repair Tools
When importing data becomes a struggle, you can often (but not always) use tools in Inventor 
to fi x the imported geometry. Typically, the biggest struggles come with importing surface 
models that did not translate well from the original CAD software. Inventor provides a Repair 
environment for repairing poorly translated surfaces. Once repaired, imported surfaces must be 
promoted to the part environment for use in parametric modeling or so they can be seen in an 
assembly. To access the Repair environment, you simply select the imported geometry from the 
browser and choose Repair Bodies. In the Repair environment, you can use the tools covered in 
the following sections to fi x the following types of imported surface geometry issues:
 
◆
Self-intersecting surfaces or curves 
 
◆
Intersecting faces 
 
◆
Modeling uncertainty (miscellaneous topology and geometry errors) 
 
◆
Irregular surfaces 
 
◆
Face normal direction is pointing the wrong way 
 
◆
Gaps between surfaces 
 
◆
Holes in surfaces 
 
◆
Overlapping faces
You can fi nd further information about the Repair environment in the Inventor Help fi les, 
including helpful Show Me Video instructions.
Edit Solid Tools
Other times you might fi nd that a model imports well but you need to make some modifi ca-
tions. In these cases, you can add features to the base solid by sketching on any of the desired 
faces and using the standard Inventor part-modeling tools. But you can also use the Edit Base 
Solid tools to manipulate the model quickly as well. To explore the basics of editing an imported 
solid body, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for and select the fi le mi_14a_003.ipt located in the Chapter 14 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Once the fi le is open, right-click the Base1 feature in the browser and choose Edit Solid.
This will activate the Edit Base Solid tab and display the base solid editing tools, as 
shown in Figure 14.11.

In these steps, you used the Edit Solid tools to modify a base solid that was originally 
imported from another fi le format. These tools can be quite useful for making small modifi ca-
tions to models obtained from supplier websites. You can close this fi le without saving changes 
and continue to the next section.
Use Edit Solid to Modify Purchased Parts
Oftentimes you’re able to locate a STEP ﬁ le of a purchased component from a supplier website but 
then ﬁ nd that you need to make modiﬁ cations to it for use in your assembly design. For instance, 
you might ﬁ nd an accurate model of an air cylinder of the correct size from a designated supplier’s 
website. Th en you realize that you need a similar model but one that is longer. You could use the 
Edit Solid tools to create a new longer version from the existing model.

VIEWING DWF MARKUP | 707
Viewing DWF Markup
Autodesk® Design Review (ADR) software offers Inventor users and anyone they work with a sim-
ple and effective way to view and mark up both 2D and 3D DWF fi les. Design Web Format (DWF) 
fi les are lightweight versions of your Inventor fi les that you can publish from Inventor and email to 
a collaborator to be viewed and redlined with ADR. Non-Inventor users can download and install 
ADR free from the Autodesk website.
The DWF markup process begins from within Inventor where you will publish a DWF from 
your Inventor fi les. Once the DWF is published, it is sent to the reviewer and marked up with 
ADR. You can then bring those markups into your Inventor fi le and change the status of a 
markup, add comments, or accept the markup. You have the additional choice of publishing to 
DWFx format, allowing reviewers to access the fi le directly through Internet Explorer.
A typical DWF markup process is as follows:
Publish  You write out the DWF fi le from Inventor 2D and/or 3D fi les.
Receive  The reviewer receives the DWF fi le from you and opens it with ADR to check for 
errors and omissions.
Review  The reviewer can comment on and mark up the DWF fi le using callouts, text 
blocks, shapes, dimensions, stamps, and custom symbols. Then they save those markups to 
the DWF fi le.
Return  The reviewer then sends the markups back to you for your review.
Revise  You load the marked-up DWF into Inventor and revise the Inventor fi les as 
required.
Republish  After revising, you write out the DWF fi le from Inventor 2D and/or 3D fi les 
again.
Publishing a DWF or DWFx File
With the fi le that you intend to publish open in Inventor, click the Inventor button and select 
Export ➢ Export To DWF, which opens the Publish dialog box. There are three options for pub-
lishing the DWF or DWFx:
Express  Publishes only the active sheet without the 3D model.
Complete  Publishes all sheets and all 3D models except sheets excluded from printing.
Custom  Chooses sheets and 3D models to publish, depending on the type of fi le you are 
publishing. Extra tabs appear in the Publish dialog box for each fi le type as required. Here’s 
what’s included for each fi le type when you are using the Custom option:
Drawing Files  The DWF or DWFx fi le includes all sheets and tables as well as the com-
plete referenced 3D models.
Assembly Files  The following assembly options are available:
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes the assembly with view and positional representa-
tions as well as enabled BOM views.
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes all members and the iAssembly table with view and 
positional representations.

708 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes the assembly with view and positional representa-
tions as well as enabled BOM views, weld beads, and weld symbols.
 
◆
When an assembly is at any LOD other than the master, only that LOD is published to 
the DWF or DWFx. All view and positional representations, as well as enabled BOM 
views, are also published.
Part Files  The following part options are available:
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes only the part model.
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes the folded model and fl at pattern (if one exists).
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes all iPart members and the iPart table.
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes only the iPart model.
 
◆
The DWF or DWFx fi le includes the model with stress/constraint indicators as well as 
a stress scale.
Presentation Files  The DWF or DWFx fi le includes the presentation views, animations, 
and assembly instructions as well as the complete assembly.
DWF or DWFx fi les can be published with the ability to measure, print, and enable and 
disable markups. They can be password protected for security also. Figure 14.15 shows the pub-
lish options for an iAssembly factory.
Figure 14.15
DWF or DWFx pub-
lish options

VIEWING DWF MARKUP | 709
Once you choose the appropriate options, click Publish to specify either the DWF or DWFx 
format, and specify a location to create the fi le. The resulting fi le can be opened in Design 
Review to create markups.
Reviewing and Marking Up DWF and DWFx Files
Once a DWF or DWFx fi le is open in Design Review, you can create markups in the form of call-
outs, text blocks, shapes, stamps, custom symbols, and measurements. Figure 14.16 shows the 
Markup & Measure tab.
Figure 14.16
Markup & Measure 
tools
When markups are created, they are listed in the Markups palettes and organized by the 
sheet on which they reside. Most markups contain the following collection of properties: Status, 
Notes, History, Created, Creator, Label, Modifi ed, and Sheet. Drawn markups such as lines do 
not have properties.
Each markup can have its own status. The status can be <None>, For Review, Question, or 
Done. When you click a markup in the Markups palettes, the screen will zoom to the markup at 
the same zoom scale at which it was created. Once markups are complete, the DWF or DWFx fi le 
can be saved. Figure 14.17 shows a view marked up in Design Review.
Figure 14.17

Design Review
Accessing DWF or DWFx Markups in Inventor
To open a markup set in Inventor, select the Get Started tab and click Open; then choose DWF 
Markup File from the Files Of Type drop-down and select the DWF fi le to bring in. The DWF 

710 | CHAPTER 14 EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS
markups will be overlaid onto the Inventor drawing, and the Markups browser will display 
the markup set in the tree view. You can then edit the status and properties of each markup by 
right-clicking the markup in the browser, as shown in Figure 14.18.
Figure 14.18
Markups loaded 
into Inventor
To experiment with markups, you can open the fi le mi_14a_016.idw from the Chapter 14 
directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and use the fi le mi_14a_016.dwfx to import 
the markups.
DWF in the Real World
When communicating with vendors and clients who have never used Design Review and are accus-
tomed to receiving PDF ﬁ les, I recommend you do not force DWF on them. Generally, you will have 
much better luck getting the uninitiated to use and eventually request DWF ﬁ les if you send them 
both PDF and DWF ﬁ les initially. Include a link to the Design Review download on the Autodesk 
website in your email and mention that the download is free and that the ﬁ les can be viewed in 3D. 
Th is approach allows the person on the other end to make the choice at their convenience. Typically, 
once they have used Design Review, this is the format they will request.
Once you’ve reviewed all markups, you can save the markups back to the DWF or DWFx fi le. 
You can choose to republish only the sheets that are marked up or republish all sheets. You can 
access these commands by right-clicking the DWF or DWFx fi lename in the Markups browser, 
as shown in Figure 14.19.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 711
Th e Bottom Line
Import and export geometry.  In the design world today, you most likely need to transfer 
fi les to or from a customer or vendor from time to time. Chances are, the fi les will need to be 
translated to or from a neutral fi le format to be read by different CAD packages.
Master It  You are collaborating with another design offi ce that does not use Inventor. 
You are asked which you would prefer, IGES or STEP fi les. Which one should you 
request?
Use Inventor fi le translators.  Inventor offers native fi le translators for CATIA, Pro/
ENGINEER, SolidWorks, Unigraphics, and other CAD fi le types. This allows you to access 
these fi le formats with Inventor and translate the fi les into Inventor fi les directly.
Master It  You are a “job shop” and in the past have been required to maintain a copy 
of SolidWorks in addition to your copy of Inventor to work with customers who send 
you SolidWorks fi les. You would like to eliminate the cost of maintaining two software 
packages. What is a good strategy for doing that?
Work with imported data.  Using the construction environment in Inventor, you can repair 
poorly translated surface fi les. Often, a fi le fails to translate into a solid because of just a few 
translation errors in the part. Repairing or patching the surfaces and promoting the fi le to a 
solid allows you to use the fi le more effectively.
Master It  You download an IGES fi le from a vendor website, but when you attempt to 
use the component in your design, the surface data is found to have issues. How should 
you proceed?
Work with Design Review markups.  Design Review offers you and the people who col-
laborate with you an easy-to-use electronic markup tool that can be round-tripped from 
Inventor. Design Review markups can be made on both 2D and 3D fi les.
Master It  Y ou want to use Design Review to communicate with vendors and clients 
to save time and resources, but you have found that others are unsure of what Design 
Review is and how to get it. What are some good ways to help others begin to use this 
handy application? 


Chapter 15
Frame Generator
Frame Generator consists of several tools to automate frame modeling. You can select lines, 
edges, and points to specify the location of members. Frame Generator derives the selections 
into a part. This part is called a skeleton because it provides the framework for the members. The 
skeleton part automatically updates when a change is made to the original geometry, which 
updates the frame member size or position.
Frame Generator gets structural profi les from Content Center. In addition to the structural 
profi les included in the Autodesk® Inventor® libraries, you can author and publish your own 
profi les. This capacity is useful for adding profi les of extruded aluminum, plastic, and other 
materials because the structural profi les in the Inventor libraries are standard steel shapes.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

About Frame Generator
Th e Frame Generator application is an add-in that uses the Inventor application programming 
interface (API). Since the API does not provide access to all the Inventor functionalities, there are 
some user interface diﬀ erences between add-ins and core Inventor tools. For example, the edit 
ﬁ elds in the core Inventor tools have an extensive ﬂ yout menu. Th e add-ins do not have access to 
this functionality, so their edit ﬁ elds are more limited.
Exploring the Frame Generator File Structure
When you create the fi rst members in a frame assembly, a dialog box prompts you for fi lenames. 
Frame Generator creates a subassembly and a skeleton fi le in the parent assembly. The subassem-
bly does several things. It acts as a container for the skeleton and frame members, isolating them 
from the assembly solver, and it acts as a fi lter so Frame Generator tools, such as Frame Member 
Info, ignore other assembly components. The skeleton fi le is created in the subassembly and con-
sists of all of the edges and points you select when placing frame members. Each frame member is 
created as a separate fi le and saved into a subdirectory named after the frame assembly.
As an example, imagine you create a cube to use as the basis on which to model a frame. You 
name the cube fi le Cube_Frame and then place this cube into an assembly called Cube_Frame_
Assembly. Both fi les are saved in a folder called My_Frames. You could then use the cube to cre-
ate a basic frame, using each of its edges as a placement reference for the frame members. When 
you create the frame, you will be prompted to supply the following items:
 
◆
A new frame fi lename and location; these are the name and location of the frame 
subassembly.
 
◆
A new skeleton fi lename and location; these are the name and location of the frame skel-
eton reference.

EXPLORING THE FRAME GENERATOR FILE STRUCTURE | 715
If you just accept the defaults, you will end up with a folder such as \My_Frames\Cube_
Frame_Assembly\Frame\. In this folder (once you have saved the top-level assembly), you will 
fi nd an assembly fi le named Frame0001.iam and a part fi le named Skeleton0001.ipt. Special 
attributes in the frame subassembly contain references to the parent assembly. This enables the 
frame skeleton to maintain references to the other assembly components. Figure 15.2 shows the 
default frame subassembly and skeleton fi le naming.
Make Sure You Save
When you click the OK button to create the Frame Generator assembly and place the ﬁ rst mem-
bers, a folder is created in the directory. However, like all Inventor ﬁ les created in the context of 
an assembly, the parts are not written to disk until you save the assembly. Th is is true when you 
create frame members as well, and since it is so easy to create members, it may not be obvious that 
you need to save them after the initial creation. Pay attention to the Save reminders and limit the 
amount of data you risk losing between saves.
Copying Frames
If you have a completed frame design that you would like to copy, you can use the iLogic Design 
Copy tool (see Chapter 20, “iLogic”) to do so. Keep in mind that you needn’t have used iLogic to 
use the iLogic Design Copy tool for copying frames. You can ﬁ nd the iLogic Design Copy tool by 
closing all of your Inventor ﬁ les and then going to the Tools tab and looking on the iLogic panel.
Use the Assemblies list panel in the iLogic Design Copy dialog box to select the frame assembly you 
want to copy. All ﬁ les referenced by the frame assembly will be selected in the other lists. You can 
then specify a target folder to copy to and specify a naming preﬁ x or suﬃ  x as needed.
Once you start the copy process, the frame ﬁ les will be copied, and the internal references will be updated.
Note that there are a couple of limitations to be aware of. First, you cannot create more than 
one frame subassembly in the same assembly. Another limitation is that you can’t use copies 
of the frame generated with the assembly Copy tool in other assemblies and maintain Frame 
Generator functionality.
Figure 15.2
Creating a new frame

716 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Exploring the Anatomy of a Frame Member
Frame Generator initially creates frame members the same length as the selected geometry. 
When you add end treatments, the length is adjusted to make the member longer or shorter. To 
accomplish this, the structural profi les are created with a From-To extrusion between two work 
planes, as shown in Figure 15.3.
When the part is fi rst created, the start plane is coincident with the XY plane, and the end 
plane is set to the initial length. When an end treatment is added, the start or end plane is 
moved to shorten or lengthen the member.
The parameter relationships that control the length are complex. Three parameters drive the 
length, two parameters are driven by those parameters to determine the length, a reference param-
eter reports the overall length, and a parameter is used in the BOM, as indicated in Figure 15.4.

G_L

Inserting Frame Members
The process for inserting frame members can be broken down into three basic steps. You select 
the frame member profi le (this comes from Content Center), select the placement geometry for 
placing the frame members, and then adjust the orientation of the frame members.
Specifying a Structural Shape
The left side of the Insert dialog box, shown in Figure 15.5, has a series of drop-down fi elds for 
specifying the structural shape.
You use the Standard, Family, and Size fi elds to select the member from Content Center. 
These fi elds are progressive from top to bottom, with one updating when changes are made to 
Figure 15.5
Frame Member 
Selection group

718 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
the one above it. However, the update behavior varies depending on the fi eld selected. If you 
select a new standard, the fi rst family is automatically selected. If you select a new family, the 
size is not automatically selected.
Changing the Orientation
After you have selected the placement geometry, you can change the position and orientation of 
the member. A thumbnail of the profi le is displayed in a grid of radio buttons that control the 
position of the member, as shown in Figure 15.6. These positions are based on the rectangular 
bounds of the profi le. As a result, the corner positions of a pipe that’s 1 inch in diameter are the 
same as they are in a 1-inch-by-1-inch square tube.
You can fi ne-tune the placement position by entering values in the horizontal and vertical 
offset fi elds. You can also rotate the member. For example, food processing equipment fre-
quently has horizontal members rotated 45 degrees so spilled food doesn’t build up on top of 
square tubing.
The Mirror Frame Member button is shown in the lower-right corner of Figure 15.6. This but-
ton is used for profi les that don’t have rotational symmetry, such as C-channel and angle iron. 
The orientation changes affect all the members of a select set. Depending on the geometry, it 
might be more effi cient to use a batch select tool and change the orientation of a few members 
afterward, or you might want to select only those members that have a similar orientation.
Since structural shapes are extruded, Frame Generator needs a method for determining the 
extrude direction. When an edge is selected, Frame Generator uses the closest endpoint as the 
start of the extrusion. Depending on where you select an edge, the same radio button can cause 
the member to be in a different position. The thumbnail is the view of the profi le looking at the 
XY plane. It takes some practice to get a good feel for the relationship between how an edge is 
selected and the behavior of the radio buttons. Once you understand this relationship, you will 
be able to predict the behavior and use it to increase your productivity.
“Do I Need to Use 3D Sketches with Frame Generator?”
Although you can use 3D sketches to base a frame on, you don’t need to do this. You can create 3D 
solids or surfaces to create a frame base. Once you have a 3D shape, you can then add 2D sketches 
to the various faces and use those sketches as selection edges as well. So, you don’t need to be well 
versed in the 3D sketch tools to create 3D frames.
Figure 15.6
Orientation group

INSERTING FRAME MEMBERS | 719
When you’re using a custom profi le with an alternate insertion point defi ned, the Custom 
Point control is enabled. This adds another insertion point to the nine standard ones. The cus-
tom point is not displayed in the thumbnail image, so you should confi rm that the preview is in 
the expected position relative to the selected edge. Figure 15.7 shows a profi le with an alternate 
insertion point.
Selecting Placement Geometry
When selecting placement geometry, you can select edges of 3D models and visible sketch lines, 
or you can select two endpoints. For instance, if you had a cube-shaped base solid, you would 
use the edges to place vertical and horizontal frame members. To place diagonal cross bracing, 
you would use the corner endpoints.
Insert Selection Methods
When you use the default Insert Members On Edges option, you can select edges and lines for 
placement references. Using edges for placement allows you to insert multiple members at once. 
When you use the Insert Members Between Points option, you select two vertices or endpoints. 
This method allows you to place only one member at a time. The most common placement 
method is by selecting lines and edges. This allows the most fl exibility in geometry selection 
and the use of batch select tools.
There are two philosophies for placing frame members. Some people like to place frame 
members individually, making sure each one is in the correct position and orientation. Others 
like to place as many members as possible and then edit them as necessary. The method you 
choose will depend on the type of models you work with, how much effort you put into setting 
up the skeleton models, and, most importantly, the way you like to work.
Batch Select Tools
Frame Generator has several tools for selecting geometry. Multi Select is the default selection 
mode. The standard methods for creating a Multi Select selection allow you to select individual 
edges, use selection windows, and use the Shift and Ctrl keys to add and remove objects to or 
from the selection. In addition to Multi Select, two other select modes are available in the con-
text menu shown in Figure 15.8; they are Chain Select and Sketch Select.
Figure 15.7
Proﬁ le with an alternate 
insertion point

720 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Chain Select automatically selects all lines and edges that are tangentially connected to the 
selection. Chain Select will not follow past a point that has multiple lines or edges, even if one 
of them is tangential. For instance, if you have a rectangular sketch profi le with rounded cor-
ners, you can use Chain Select and select just one of the lines or arcs, and all of the others will 
be added automatically. By contrast, if you have the same profi le in a 3D shape, Chain Select 
will not automatically select the edges because each edge of the 3D shape has multiple edge 
intersections.
Sketch Select selects all the lines in a sketch. You can select the sketch in the browser or click 
a line in the graphics window. For instance, if you have a ladder-shaped sketch, you can use 
Sketch Select and automatically select the rungs and rails all at once.
The Merge option is enabled when there are connected lines or edges. Merge combines the 
selections into one member. Although Merge is useful when you want to have one continuous 
member, you cannot add end treatments to merged members.
Creating a Basic Frame
To create an elementary frame, you’ll use a prepared fi le that has been set up for you. If you have 
not already downloaded the Chapter 15 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/masteringinventor2015, 
please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the download and setup 
instructions.
The prepared fi le you’ll be using is an assembly fi le consisting of just two parts and the 
frame subassembly. One of the parts contains an unconsumed sketch that you will use to 
place frame members. The frame members will be automatically placed in the predefi ned frame 
subassembly. When creating your own frame designs from scratch, you’ll be asked to supply 
the name and locations for the frame subassembly and skeleton fi les. In this design, you’ll add 
frame members to be embedded in a monument base to support a sign plate:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_001.iam located in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Design tab, click the Insert Frame button.
 
4. Set the Standard drop-down box to use the standard of your choice.
 
5. Set the Family drop-down box to use a square tube or square hollow section profi le.
 
6. Set the Size drop-down box to use an 80 mm×80 mm (or 3”×3”) section, using a wall 
thickness of your choice.
 
7. Select the middle vertical sketch line on the back of the sign plate in the model.
Figure 15.8

INSERTING FRAME MEMBERS | 721
 
8. Use the radio buttons in the Orientation area of the Insert dialog box to orient the frame 
member so it matches up with the square cutout in the base.
 
9. Select the other four vertical sketch lines as well. Note that the two end members are not 
centered in the cutouts.
 
10. Holding the Ctrl key, select the two end members to remove them from the selection.
 
11. Click the OK button to generate the frame members; then click the OK button in the 
Frame Member Naming dialog box to accept the defaults.
 
12. Click the Insert Frame button again and click the bottom half of one of the outside verti-
cal sketch lines.
 
13. Use the radio buttons in the Orientation area to orient the frame member so it matches up 
with the square cutout.
 
14. Select the bottom half of the other outside vertical sketch line and notice that the frame 
member preview does not match the cutout.
 
15. Using the Orientation radio buttons, you’ll notice that none of the solutions allows both 
members to match the cutouts.
 
16. Holding the Ctrl key, click one of the frame members to remove it from the selection.
 
17. Select the sketch line again, this time toward the top, and you’ll see that this fl ips the ori-
entation to provide the correct solution.
 
18. Uncheck the Prompt For File Name check box (found along the bottom of the dialog box). 
This suppresses the fi lenaming dialog prompt and automatically accepts the default nam-
ing for the frame members.
 
19. Click the OK button. Your assembly should resemble Figure 15.9.
Figure 15.9
Frame members placed 
using Frame Generator

722 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
In this simple example you explored the basics of placing frame members, noting the use of 
the Ctrl key on the keyboard to remove selections. You also noticed that orientation of frame 
members is sometimes infl uenced by the location of your lines or edge selections. You can close 
this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section. In the next example, you’ll 
explore more selection and orientation options.
Where Are the Other Common Sizes?
You might note that there are several common sizes you use daily that are not listed in the Size 
drop-down. Th is is because Inventor includes only the sizes that are ratiﬁ ed to the various structural 
shape standards. Of course, most mills produce other sizes commonly used in general design. You 
can add those sizes using the Structural Shape authoring tools.
In the following steps you will explore the offset, rotation, and merge options, as well as the 
context menu selection options:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_002.iam in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Design tab, click the Insert Frame button.
 
4. Set the Standard drop-down box to use the standard of your choice.
 
5. Set the Family drop-down box to use a fl at bar section profi le.
 
6. Set the Size drop-down box to use a 50 mm (or 2-inch) bar, using a thickness of 
your choice.
 
7. Right-click in the graphics area and set the selection method to Chain Select.
 
8. Click any part of the C-shaped sketch and notice that the entire sketch loop is selected; 
you don’t need to click each sketch segment.
 
9. Set Horizontal Offset to -100 mm.
 
10. Set Rotation to 90 degrees.
 
11. Click the Merge check box to ensure that the result is a continuous piece of rolled fl at bar 
rather than a piece for each segment of the loop.
 
12. Click Apply to create the frame member.
 
13. Right-click in the graphics area and set the selection method to Sketch Select.
 
14. Select any of the segments in the ladder sketch and notice that the entire sketch is 
selected.
 
15. Set the horizontal offset to 0 mm and the rotation to 0 degrees.
 
16. Click Apply to create the frame members.

17. Right-click in the graphics area and set the selection method back to the default Multi 
Select option.
 
18. In the Placement area of the Insert dialog box, click the Insert Members Between Points 
button and then select endpoints of the gap in the C-shaped sketch.
 
19. Set the rotation to 90 degrees.
 
20. Click the OK button to create the short length of fl at bar and close the dialog box. 
Figure 15.10 shows the fi nal result.
As you can see, the selection options along with the offset, rotation, and merge options allow 
you to create frame members using just a simple sketch and still get a varied result. You can 
close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Aligning Frame Members
Frame Generator follows two rules to give a frame member its initial orientation. If you are 
creating the fi rst member in a selection set, the member is aligned to adjacent geometry or the 
coordinate system. For the rest of the selection set, Frame Generator tries to align the members 
to the fi rst selection. These rules work well for most rectangular machine frames. However, if 
part of the frame is at an angle and there isn’t a good reference, Frame Generator might select an 
orientation that doesn’t match your design intent.
The frame in Figure 15.11 has two sketch lines running down from the center point to be 
used for supports. The members for the base and back have already been inserted, and the two 
angled supports need to be inserted. When a member is inserted on angled lines, the orientation 
is skewed, as shown in the inset in Figure 15.11.
Figure 15.10
Flat bar frame members

724 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
To resolve this, a reference line can be selected fi rst to establish the orientation, and then the 
angled line can be selected to add the support member and have it follow this orientation. Once 
the angled line is selected, the reference line can be deselected, and the angled line will hold the 
proper orientation, as shown in Figure 15.12.
Using reference geometry for angled frame members is a bit of an art. If you regularly create 
these types of frames, you will develop a feeling for the ways that Frame Generator aligns mem-
bers, and you will learn when and how you need to add references. To better understand the use 
of reference geometry for alignment, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_003.iam located in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Design tab, click the Insert Frame button.
 
4. Set the Standard drop-down box to use the standard of your choice.
 
5. Set the Family drop-down box to use a rectangular tube or rectangular hollow section profi le.

INSERTING FRAME MEMBERS | 725
 
6. Set the Size drop-down box to use a 100 mm×50 mm (or 4”×2”) tube, using a thickness of 
your choice.
 
7. Ensure that the placement option is set to Insert Members On Edges and that the offsets 
and rotation fi elds are set to zero. Set the orientation to be centered and then click the 
diagonal line that runs into the frame peak.
 
8. Click the OK button to create the member.
Notice how the frame member is coming in at a skewed orientation. To resolve this, you 
will fi rst delete this member and then place another, but this time you’ll use a helper edge 
to establish the orientation.
 
9. In the browser, expand Frame_MI_1503 so you can see the frame members.
 
10. Hover over each member until you see the one you just created highlighted in the graph-
ics area (it should be at the bottom of the list).
 
11. Right-click it and choose Delete With Frame Generator.
Using this option not only deletes the part but also cleans up any end treatments involv-
ing other members related to the deleted one.
 
12. Click the Insert Frame button again. Click the diagonal line that runs into the frame peak 
fi rst and then select the Align check box.
 
13. Click the sketch line located in the base of the frame to use as the alignment selection.
 
14. Adjust the rotation angle by 90 degrees.
 
15. Click the OK button to create the frame member in the correct orientation.
Keep this alignment trick in mind as you create frames, and you will likely fi nd it to be very 
helpful. You can close the fi le without saving changes.
Using the Change Tool
You can use the Change tool to change the standard, family, size, material, color, and orientation 
of an existing frame member. You can use the check boxes to set the various options to allow or 
prevent changes. To see the Change tool in action, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_004.iam located in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Design tab, click the Frame panel drop-down arrow.
 
4. Select the Frame Member Info button from the list.
 
5. Click one of the shorter uprights in the frame. The Frame Member Info dialog box dis-
plays the information about this part. Click Done to close the dialog box.
 
6. From the Design tab, click the Change button.
 
7. Click one of the shorter uprights in the frame again and then select the other one. Notice 
that the selection allows only one frame member to be selected at a time.

726 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
 
8. Click the Multi Select check box in the Change dialog box and then select the other short 
upright member.
 
9. Click the Change Orientation check box and then set the rotation to 45 degrees.
 
10. Change the Appearance setting to Cadet Blue or something similar and then click the OK 
button.
This simple exercise demonstrates the use of the Change tool to modify frame members. 
Keep in mind that if you make a change that requires a new fi le to be generated, such as chang-
ing the size, the old part will be replaced with a new one but the old fi le will remain in the 
folder in which it is saved. You can close this fi le without saving changes.
Adding End Treatments
The end treatments are among the most powerful Frame Generator tools. As you add end treat-
ments, the frame member length automatically updates. The end treatments also carry over if you 
change the frame member to a different profi le. End treatments are listed under the frame member 
node in the browser and can be accessed by expanding the browser node, as shown in Figure 15.13.
You can delete end treatments from the browser, or you can use the Remove End Treatments 
tool found on the Frame drop-down list of the Design tab. When you use the Remove End 
Treatments tool, all end treatments are stripped from the selected frame member.
If a member has end treatments on it already and you attempt to add another, you will need 
to select the Delete Existing End Treatment(s) check box in the dialog box; otherwise, an error 
such as the one shown in Figure 15.14 may be created.
Figure 15.13

browser
Figure 15.14
Conﬂ icting end treat-
ment error

ADDING END TREATMENTS | 727
If you do encounter an error, simply undo the change and reapply the end treatment, this 
time using the Delete Existing End Treatment(s) option.
Miter
The Miter end treatment makes angle cuts on two members. Figure 15.15 shows the Miter dialog 
box. You can miter multiple members by applying the end treatment to each pair of members. 
You can add a gap between the members by entering a value in the gap input box. The default 
gap is split between the two members. If you want the gap to be taken from just one member, 
you can use the Miter Cut At One Side button, and the gap will be taken from the fi rst member 
you selected. Figure 15.15 shows the gap option buttons and input box.
The default selections cut along an angle, resulting in full-face contact between the members, 
as shown in Figure 15.16. Bi-sect Miter splits the angle between the members. Figure 15.17 shows 
that the cut is located where the centers of the two members intersect.

Figure 15.18 shows a one-sided gap where the horizontal member was selected fi rst.
Figure 15.19 has a miter end treatment between the two angled members and a vertical mem-
ber running through them. The vertical member needs to be mitered to fi t. Figure 15.19 shows 
the left member and the vertical member being selected for the fi rst step to create the miter.
The vertical member still needs a miter to trim the other side, so the miter is repeated with 
the same settings, this time choosing the member on the right and the vertical member, as 
shown in Figure 15.20.
Figure 15.18

member

Second miter cut

ADDING END TREATMENTS | 729
The resulting miter, shown in Figure 15.21, requires two cuts on each member. An alternate 
method that produces a more cost-effective joint can be made using the Trim/Extend To Face tool.
You can open the fi le mi_15a_006.iam to explore the Miter tool. Practice creating miter gaps 
and two- and three-member miters to understand the process.
Trim/Extend to Face
This end treatment is the only one that can trim multiple members at once. When trimming or 
extending to a face, you select the members you want to trim and then select the cutting face. A 
separate end treatment feature is created for each frame member. If you edit or delete the end 
treatment for a particular member, it does not affect the other members. Figure 15.22 shows a 
typical trim-to-face situation. You would select the vertical member for the member to trim and 
the top face of the horizontal member as the face to trim to.
This end treatment can also be used to create miters. Applying miter end treatments to 
already mitered frame members results in a costly complex joint cut for all three members. 
Trimming the third member to fi t the fi rst two angled members using the Trim/Extend To Face 
tool results in the less-expensive detail shown in Figure 15.23.
You can open the fi le mi_15a_007.iam to explore the Trim/Extend tool. Remember, you can 
select multiple frame members to trim to the same face. Experiment with this fi le as you like—
there is no set solution to the fi nal frame outcome.

730 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Which Side Is Trimmed?
Be aware that when using the Trim tools in Frame Generator, the short end is always the one to 
be discarded.
Trim to Frame Member
This end treatment trims or extends both members so they are fl ush. The fi rst selection is made 
fl ush to the second selection, and the second selection butts up to the fi rst. Figure 15.24 shows 
the selections, and Figure 15.25 shows the results.
You can open the fi le mi_15a_008.iam to explore the Trim To Frame tool. Experiment with 
this fi le as you like—there is no set solution to the fi nal frame outcome. If you cannot get the 
result you want from the Trim To Frame tool alone, consider the Trim/Extend To Face tool as 
well. These tools are often used together to achieve a specifi c result.
Notch Frame Members
The Notch tool cuts one frame member to match the other. It uses the profi le to create a cut-
ting surface. By default you can’t create an offset, so the cut is an exact match. This is simply 
Figure 15.23
Creating a miter 
using Trim
Figure 15.24
Trim To Frame 
selections

ADDING END TREATMENTS | 731
a cut operation, so the frame member is not shortened or extended before the cut. If you have 
authored a notch profi le into a custom frame member library fi le, you can select the Apply 
Notch Profi le check box; however, if the member does not contain a notch profi le defi nition, the 
check box is grayed out.
If you were to notch the shorter I-beam shown in Figure 15.26, which extends past the taller 
I-beam, the extra lump would remain on the left, as shown in Figure 15.27. If the members don’t 
intersect, the notch will have no effect.
Because of this, it’s often best to create a notch as a secondary end treatment. For example, 
if you had two intersecting frame members as shown in Figure 15.26, it might be best to add a 
Trim/Extend To Face end treatment fi rst and then use a notch to remove any intersecting mate-
rial. To explore the Notch tool, open the fi le mi_15a_009.iam. Use the fl anged beams to create 
notches in the T-shaped members.

732 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Creating Accurate Notches
Notch shapes are driven by manufacturing requirements. Typically, the shape is simpliﬁ ed to reduce 
cost, and there may be a gap between the members to allow for tolerances. Th e easiest way to create 
these shapes is to add a Trim/Extend To Face to make the member the correct length and then add 
an iFeature to trim the end of the member to the correct shape. You can also deﬁ ne notch proﬁ les 
in custom frame member deﬁ nitions.
Lengthen/Shorten Frame Member
You can use the Lengthen/Shorten tool to change the length of a frame member. By default, 
frame members are initially assigned the length of the reference edge or the distance between 
selected points. However, you will often need to change the length. Much of the time you will 
simply use another frame member and one of the Extend or Trim tools. Sometimes, though, 
there isn’t another frame member you can use as a reference, so in those cases you would use 
the Lengthen/Shorten tool.
When you use the Lengthen/Shorten At One End option, the Extension value is applied to the 
end closest to the pick point, meaning that if you select a vertical frame member toward the top 
end and specify an extension length of 100 mm, that value will be applied to the top end. When 
using the Lengthen/Shorten At Both Ends option, the Extension value is applied to both ends. So 
if you applied a 100 mm extension value, the frame member would grow 100 mm on both ends for 
a total of 200 mm. If you enter a negative value, the frame member will be shortened.
Frame End Treatments Are Not Exempt from Design Intent
You should spend time planning your frame design to minimize the number of end treatments 
required because each end treatment is an opportunity for the model to fail if a change is made. 
For example, if you create a skeleton to the inside dimensions of a frame, you can oﬀ set members 
during placement so the members butt against one another without adding end treatments.
Reuse Frame Members
When you use the Insert Frame tool, Inventor creates a new part fi le for each new frame member 
you insert. This allows you to create separate part fi les that allow separate end treatments. For 
instance, you might initially insert two identical frame members but then choose to miter both 
ends of one but only one end of the other. Having two separate part fi les allows this. 
However, there are often times when you might want to reuse the same frame member over 
and over. In these cases you would prefer not to have separate part fi les and could use the Reuse 
tool to ensure that the same part fi le is being reused as needed. To see the Reuse tool in action, 
follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_005.iam located in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Design tab, click the Reuse button.
 
4. For the Source Member selection, click the longer existing member from the graphics area.

ADDING END TREATMENTS | 733
 
5. Click the longer sketch line to use as the Placement selection, but be sure to select it at the 
end of the line furthest from the existing short member (near the sketched arc).
 
6. Click the OK button to create the new frame member and notice the direction of the holes.
 
7. Next click the Change Reuse button.
 
8. Choose the member you just created and then click the Reverse Member Direction but-
ton; then click the OK button to see the change. Notice the direction of the holes again.
 
9. Click the Miter tool and select the ends of the two original frame members when they 
come to an intersection and then click Apply.
 
10. Still in the Miter tool, click the remaining end of the short member and the corresponding 
end of the new long frame member (even though it is already mitered) and then click the 
OK button.
 
11. Click the Reuse button and choose the shorter member for the Source Member selection.
 
12. Choose the remaining straight sketch line for the Placement selection and then click the 
OK button to create the new frame member.
 
13. Click the Change Reuse button, select the new short frame member, set Orientation Angle 
to 180 degrees, and then click the OK button.
 
14. Click the Miter tool and select the unmitered end of the original longer member and the 
corresponding end of the shorter member; then click the OK button to create the miter. 
The Reuse and Change Reuse tools offer powerful options for working with repetitive frame 
members in your frame designs. Keep these tools in mind when working with frame design, and 
you can likely simplify your frame bill of materials and save yourself some work along the way. 
Here are a few things to know about the Reuse and Change Reuse tools:
 
◆
The Reuse tool is available only to straight frame members and will not work for curved 
members.
 
◆
To convert a frame member created with the Reuse tool to a separate frame member fi le, 
you can locate it in the browser and then right-click it and choose Break Reuse Member. 
 
◆
When you use Break Reuse Member, you will lose any existing end treatments found on 
that member.
 
◆
Frame members created using the Reuse tool might not be selectable for some end treat-
ment and other frame modifi cations tools.
 
◆
If you modify the frame base inputs on which a Reuse frame member relies, such as the base 
sketch, an error message will display, and you will likely need to delete the Reuse member.
 
◆
You can delete a Reuse member by locating it in the browser and then right-clicking it and 
choosing Delete with Frame Generator.
 
◆
In addition to the Orientation Angle options, you might need to use the Align check box 
in the Reuse and Change Reuse dialog boxes in order to reuse members so that they are 
placed in the correct orientation.

734 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
When you’ve fi nished exploring the Reuse and Change Reuse tools, you can close this fi le 
without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Maintaining Frames
Maintaining existing assemblies can be time-consuming. Frame Generator provides several 
tools that help streamline the process of modifying end treatments and determining how 
frames were originally designed.
Remove End Treatments
The Remove End Treatments tool removes all end treatments from a selected frame mem-
ber. You can also select multiple members for the batch removal of end treatments. This is 
handy if you need to change the end treatments on a few members or if you have to rebuild 
a frame. You can find the Remove End Treatments tool in the Frame drop-down list indi-
cated by the small black arrow on the Frame panel of the Design tab. (See Figure 15.1 earlier 
in the chapter.)
Frame Member Information
The Frame Member Information tool is used to query frame members. It displays the family 
and size information, mass properties, and material. This is a useful tool because it quickly 
gives you information about a member. For example, it can help you quickly determine the dif-
ference in the wall thickness of two similarly sized hollow tubes. Since the tool fi lters for only 
frame members, you can use it at any level of the assembly. You can fi nd the Frame Member 
Information tool in the Frame drop-down list indicated by the small black arrow found on the 
Frame panel of the Design tab.
Refresh
The Refresh tool is a Content Center tool. It checks Content Center for the latest revision of the 
members in the frame. If a newer version is available, it will prompt you to replace it. End treat-
ments are retained during refresh, but other features, such as holes, are not carried over to the 
new member. You can fi nd the Refresh tool in the Frame drop-down list indicated by the small 
black arrow on the Frame panel of the Design tab.
Managing Frame Generator Files
Frame Generator uses an algorithm to create default ﬁ lenames. You can rename the ﬁ les as you 
create them, when prompted by the Frame Member Naming dialog. But often this slows the design 
process and requires you to enter information you may not currently know.
Another approach is to let Inventor apply the ﬁ lenames automatically. To do so, you can uncheck 
the ﬁ lenaming prompt check box in the Insert Frame dialog box, and Inventor will create the ﬁ le-
names and save the ﬁ les to the location speciﬁ ed when the frame subassembly and skeleton ﬁ les 
were initially created. It is a good idea to set the frame subassembly and skeleton ﬁ lenames and 
locations to use a well-planned naming scheme, whether you specify the frame member names or 
let Inventor do so.

PERFORMING CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS | 735
If you decide to accept the default ﬁ lenames, it is a good idea to use the BOM Editor to set the part 
number iProperty for each ﬁ le to match your standard. In this way, you have a unique identiﬁ er for 
each part member. You can set two identical frame members to have the same part number so they 
are rolled up together in the BOM. Using part numbers (you can think of them as mark numbers), 
rather than the ﬁ lenames, to manage the frame members provides a more ﬂ exible and real-world 
workﬂ ow for the typical frame design.
Once part numbers have been deﬁ ned, you can also set the assembly browser to use the part num-
ber rather than the ﬁ lenames. Th is allows you to quickly index individual frame parts more easily. 
Do this by selecting the Assembly tab, clicking the drop-down list on the Productivity panel, and 
choosing the Rename Browser Nodes tool.
Although Frame Generator can create frames (and therefore a lot of part ﬁ les) quickly, once the 
frame is modeled, you should slow down and take the time to manage part numbers. Th is allows 
your design to be managed properly in the detailing and revision stages.
You can ﬁ nd a supplemental PDF ﬁ le called Frame Generator BOM in the Chapter 15 directory 
of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
Performing Calculations and Analysis
Included in the standard Frame Generator tools are two calculator tools: the Beam And Column 
Calculator and the Plate Calculator. These calculators are design accelerator tools that can do a sim-
ple stress analysis. The Beam And Column Calculator, for instance, can analyze a single beam or col-
umn, but it assumes a uniform cross section, so it does not take into account holes or end treatments.
If you have Inventor Professional or Inventor Simulation, you can use the Frame Analysis 
tools that are part of those packages. You can learn more about the Frame Analysis tools in 
Chapter 17, “Stress Analysis and Dynamic Simulation.”
Th e Beam and Column Calculator
You can fi nd the Beam And Column Calculator tool in the Frame drop-down list indicated by the 
small black arrow found on the Frame panel of the Design tab. As with other design accelerator 
dialog boxes, the message pane at the bottom and the calculation results pane on the right side 
can be opened and closed by clicking the small >> symbols. You can drag the splitter bar (double 
gray lines) to resize the panes, or you can double-click the splitter bar to open or close the panes.
Calculating Section Properties
As you explore the subjects in the following pages, you can refer to the conveyor assembly in the 
fi le mi_15a_014.iam. Take a moment to open this fi le from the Chapter 15 directory to become 
familiar with it. You will use this fi le to complete the exercise steps presented later.
Select an Object
In this assembly, the Beam And Column Calculator might be used to calculate the loading on 
the power roller supports. When one of the gold tubes is selected, the calculator automatically 
loads the section properties from Content Center, as shown in Figure 15.28. Although Content 
Center has most of the section properties, be aware that some data is missing. You can use sev-
eral methods for determining the properties.

736 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Use the Region Properties Tool
Inventor has a tool to calculate the properties of a closed sketch profi le. If you want to use this 
tool for the section properties of a frame member, you can open the frame member, place a 
sketch on one end, and project the face. Once you have the profi le, select the Inspect tab, and 
click the Region Properties tool on the Measure panel. Select the profi le you want to analyze 
and click Calculate. The basic region properties for any closed loop are calculated. You can then 
calculate the rest of the properties based on those results.
The region properties are calculated with respect to the sketch origin. Depending on the pro-
fi le, you may have to edit the sketch coordinate system to locate the sketch origin at the center of 
the profi le.
Use the Section Button
Another option for calculating section properties is to use the Section button in the Beam And 
Column Calculator. When you click the button, a list of geometric shapes appears. When you 
select a shape, a dialog box like Figure 15.29 appears and allows you to enter dimensions. The 
calculated properties assume sharp corners and constant thickness, so the results won’t be accu-
rate for profi les with tapered fl anges but may be good enough for many applications.

tion properties for a

PERFORMING CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS | 737
The Flip Section button is used to change the orientation of the x- and y-axes. The z-axis is 
always in the direction of the extrusion. Gravity is always in the negative y-axis direction, so it is 
important to make sure the calculation coordinates match the assembly coordinates. If the beam 
is at an angle, you have a couple of options for handling gravity. You can place a copy of the 
beam horizontally in the assembly. If you want to ignore the effect of gravity, there is an option 
on the Beam Calculation tab to turn the gravity load off.
Both Beam and Column calculations are available. The Beam calculations focus on defl ec-
tion based on loads and supports. The Column calculation checks for buckling. You can select 
Beam, Column, or both calculation types. The Calculation tabs are turned on and off based on 
the selections.
The default material properties do not correspond to a material style and are not linked to 
the style library in any way. Instead, these materials provide you with a starting point and an 
example of the required properties. You can enter properties for a particular material, or you 
can select one of the generic materials listed. When you check the box, a dialog box appears with 
materials such as gray cast iron, steel, and aluminum. These properties can be used for initial 
calculations, but for more accurate results, you should enter the properties for the particular 
alloy you are using.
The following steps use the power roller supports found in the conveyor assembly 
mi_15a_014.iam. Follow these steps to enter the member data into the dialog box:
 
1. Click the Beam/Column Calculator button to start the calculator. Recall that this but-
ton can be found in the drop-down list indicated by the small black arrow on the Frame 
panel of the Design tab.
 
2. Select the lower, gold-colored support for the power roller.
 
3. If necessary, click the padlock icon for the Section Length row in the table, thereby 
unlocking it for editing. Change the value to 12 inch.
 
4. Click the Section button and select Rectangle from the drop-down list.
 
5. In the Rectangle dialog box, enter the tubing dimensions. Enter 1.5 inch for the outside 
dimensions (B and H) and 1.125 inch for the inside dimensions (b and h). Then click the 
OK button.
 
6. Select both the Beam and Column calculation check boxes in the Calculation Type area.
 
7. Click the check box next to the Material fi eld to launch the Material Types dialog box. 
Select Steel and click the OK button.
 
8. Note the Yield Strength of 44000 psi.
 
9. Leave this dialog open because you will use it in the next set of steps, where you’ll work 
with loads and supports.
The coordinate system alignment is correct for this example. So in this case, gravity could be 
ignored, but having the correct orientation simplifi es adding the loads and interpreting the results.
The dialog box should look like Figure 15.30. Note that all the section properties except 
Shear Displacement Ratio are calculated. This property is optional for the calculations. 
Comparing the calculated values with the original ones, Section Area and Moments Of Inertia 
are close but higher.

738 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
The Beam Calculation Tab
The Beam Calculation tab, shown in Figure 15.31, has controls for defi ning the loads and sup-
ports for beams and columns as well as the calculation options. The Engineer’s Handbook (hid-
den away in the Power Transmission panel drop-down list; it’s called Handbook) contains the 
equations used in the calculations. You might want to review those equations before using the 
calculator.

The Options dialog box, shown in Figure 15.32, gives access to visibility controls for the 2D 
and 3D previews. By default, the loads and supports dynamically update to maintain the same 
size as the view scale changes. You can turn off the automatic update and set a static scale value. 
The Options dialog box is the same whether it is launched from the Loads control or Supports 
control.

Each load or support can be edited in the browser by double-clicking or by clicking the 
browse (…) button. A Properties dialog box displays controls for specifying the location, size, 
and direction of the force.
Calculation Properties
The Calculation Properties group, as shown in Figure 15.33, has four controls that adjust how 
the calculations are made.
Figure 15.33
Th e Calculation 
Properties group
The Use Density check box adds gravity as a load. This is selected by default. The Use Shear 
Displacement Ratio check box is used when calculating the twist angle caused by torsional 
loads. The value is determined by the profi le shape. It is also called the form factor of shear. This 
check box is selected by default.
The default setting for Number Of Beam Divisions is 1000. Increasing the number of divi-
sions can result in improved accuracy for longer beams. You should experiment with different 
values to see whether the number of divisions causes a signifi cant change in the results.
Mode Of Reduced Stress has two options for modeling the stress distribution. The Huber-
Mises-Hencky (HMH) method is based on the maximum-energy-distortion criterion, and the 

PERFORMING CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS | 741
Tresca-Guest method is based on the maximum-shearing-stress criterion. The HMH method is 
the default selection.
Results
The Results pane on the right side of the Beam Calculation tab updates when you click the 
Calculate button. Warnings will appear in the lower pane if the calculation indicates that 
stresses are too high.
For the conveyor example, the support will be welded to the frame at one end and unsup-
ported at the other. The power roller weighs 150 pounds, and the torque is 40 pound-feet. The 
torque causes the power roller to twist between the supports. The edge of the fl at is 1.5 inches 
from the center of the power roller. This means the reaction force at that point is 320 pounds. 
Both the weight and the reaction force are split between the two sides. Follow these steps to 
explore the results and calculation workfl ow:
 
1. Ensure that the fi rst load type is set to Radial Force.
 
2. Click the … button to add a force for the power roller weight.
 
3. Enter 10 (inches) for the distance and 75 (pounds-force) for the force. This is the maxi-
mum distance for the power roller. Click the OK button to close the Radial Force 
dialog box.
 
4. Click the Add Torque button to add a torque reaction force.
 
5. Enter 11.12 (inches) for the distance and 160 (pounds-force) for the force and then click 
the OK button.
 
6. Click the drop-down list to switch from Loads to the Supports browser.
 
7. Delete the Free support by selecting it and then clicking the red X button.
 
8. Click the drop-down arrow for the Fixed support and select Restraint.
 
9. Leave the Use Density option checked.
 
10. Deselect Use Shear Displacement Ratio since you don’t have a value for that property.
 
11. Click the Calculate button and compare the reduced stress to the yield strength of the 
specifi ed material.
 
12. Leave this dialog open and use it to explore the next topics.
The dialog box should look like Figure 15.34. Note that the forces are displayed in the graph-
ics window. If you hover over a force arrow on the model, a tool tip displays the information. 
You can drag the force to a different position, or you can double-click the force to display the 
properties dialog box.

data entered into 
the calculator
The Beam Graphs Tab
On the Beam Graphs tab, the Graph Selection pane allows you to select the results you want to 
display. The selected graph displays in the bottom of the Graph area. At the top of the Graph 
area is a schematic of the beam, supports, and loads. You can drag the supports and loads to 
different positions to update them. If you double-click a support or load, the properties dialog 
box displays so you can directly edit the data. The Calculate button is not available on the Beam 
Graphs tab, so you need to switch back to the Beam Calculation tab to update the results.
The Beam Graphs tab is primarily intended for reviewing results. Twenty-two graphs are 
available on the tab. This example is a pretty simple analysis. You should experiment with 
other loads (torques and bending moments) and support types and then view the results on the 
graphs.
The Column Calculation Tab
The Column Calculation tab checks for column buckling. In the Loads area, you enter the axial 
load and the safety factor and select a coeffi cient for the end loading conditions. When you click 
the … button, a dialog box appears with four end conditions. If you have different end condi-
tions, you should enter the proper coeffi cient from a reference book.

PERFORMING CALCULATIONS AND ANALYSIS | 743
You shouldn’t need to enter any data in the Column area. The length, section area, and least 
moment of inertia are carried over from the Model tab. The reduced length value is calculated 
by multiplying the length by the end coeffi cient.
For example, imagine that during transport, the frame shifts and the power roller supports 
slam into the trailer wall. The power roller was removed during shipping, so the supports take 
all the force from the impact, estimated at 4,000 pounds evenly distributed across the four sup-
ports. Set the axial load to 1,000-pound force, and click Calculate to determine whether the 
supports will buckle. Figure 15.35 shows the results.

HTML Results
When you click the Results button in the upper-right corner of the dialog box, an HTML page 
appears with all the data, calculation results, and graphs. You can save or print this fi le for your 
records.
File Naming
The File Naming button, found next to the Results button in the upper-right corner of the dialog 
box, allows you to specify the calculation’s fi lename. When you click the OK button to exit the 
Beam And Column Calculator dialog box, a subassembly fi le is created in the assembly fi le. 

744 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
This subassembly fi le is just a container for the calculations, allowing you to access them again 
at any point. A browser node is created for the calculations. To edit the results, simply right-click 
the browser node and choose Edit Using Design Accelerator.
Publishing Frame Members
Frame Generator’s frame member library is integrated with Content Center. The authoring and 
publishing process is similar to that used to create any custom Content Center fi les. Since Frame 
Generator requires specifi c modeling techniques, the authoring process will make some changes 
to the model and the parameters to ensure that all of the required parameters are included.
Authoring a Part
The authoring process for a frame member is similar to component authoring. The Structural 
Shape Authoring tool, located on the Part-Modeling panel bar, is used to prepare the part for 
publishing. The tool identifi es the geometry used for placement, sets the parameters, and modi-
fi es the part so Frame Generator can use it.
This example uses a rubber bumper iPart fi le like might be attached to frames to guard 
against impact. In the iPart table there are parameters to control the dimensions and three sizes 
defi ned. If this were a true frame member profi le, the engineering properties (moments of iner-
tia and so on) might need to be calculated, and therefore that information would be set up as 
well. Since this isn’t a load-bearing part, those properties aren’t required. To explore the author-
ing process, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_15a_020.ipt located in the Chapter 15 directory of your Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. From the Manage tab, locate the drop-down list on the Author panel and then click the 
Structural Shape button.
 
4. When the authoring tool starts, everything is blank. Once a category is selected, the dia-
log box will update with the appropriate controls. Because this is an unusual part, select 
the Other category, as shown in Figure 15.36.
Frame Generator looks in the Structural Shapes category only, so you have to select one 
of the standard categories or create a new one in the Content Center Editor. You can’t add 
a category through the authoring tool, so you have to add the category to Content Center 
before authoring. See Chapter 7, “Reusing Parts and Features,” for more information on 
Content Center.
Since there is only one extrusion in the part, the base feature is automatically selected. 
The default base point is indicated at the center of the profi le. For this part, the inside cor-
ner of the fl anges is the natural insertion point.
 
5. Click the drop-down list, choose Select Geometry, and then select that point in the model, 
as shown in Figure 15.37. Note that you may need to use the ViewCube® to look at the end 
view of the part to see the insert point selection.

The Notch Profi le option is used when you are authoring frame members and you want 
to include a predefi ned notch profi le to be used with the Notch tool. In this case, there is 
no notch profi le.
 
6. Click the Parameter Mapping tab.
 
7. Set the Base Length row to use the Length parameter by clicking the Please Select cell in 
the table and then choosing Length from the list.
The Parameter Mapping tab has one required fi eld: Base Length. This is the param-
eter for the extrusion distance. Since this is an iPart, when you click in the fi eld, the 

746 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
iPart properties are listed, as shown in Figure 15.38. If this were a regular part, the Part 
Template Parameters dialog box would display a browser tree, as shown in Figure 15.39. 
The rest of the parameters are optional. They are mechanical properties of the profi le nec-
essary for calculating loads with the Beam And Column Calculator.

8. Click the OK button to update the part with the authoring changes.

PUBLISHING FRAME MEMBERS | 747
Clicking either the Publish Now or OK button will update the part and close the dialog 
box. Publish Now will also launch Content Center publishing wizard. Once the part is 
updated, a dialog box displays with information about the changes. A log fi le that lists 
the changes to the part, as shown in Figure 15.40, is created in the project directory.
Figure 15.40

9. Click the OK button in the Structural Shape Authoring notice dialog box.
 
10. You can close the fi le without saving changes or use this fi le to explore the publishing 
options.
If you inspect the part after authoring, you will see that the browser and parameters have 
been updated. The details of the model and parameters are discussed in the section “Exploring 
the Anatomy of a Frame Member” earlier in this chapter.
Test Before You Publish
Before you publish the member for your team to use, be sure to test it in every conceivable situation. 
Even a seemingly well-constructed frame member can cause issues after end treatments are applied.
Publishing a Part
The publishing process uses the Publish Guide Wizard. Since the part was authored, most of the 
publishing information has already been added to the fi le. If you aren’t familiar with publishing 
to Content Center, review Chapter 7.
These publishing steps are important for Frame Generator:
 
◆
When you defi ne the family key columns, the Length parameter must be set as a key 
column.
 
◆
In the Family Properties pane, the standard organization is used to categorize the member 
during insertion. If you leave this fi eld blank, the category selection will be Unknown.
 
◆
In the thumbnail image pane, a special thumbnail is displayed. Since the thumbnail is used 
as the orientation image in the dialog boxes, it is important to use the thumbnail that Frame 
Generator creates.

748 | CHAPTER 15 FRAME GENERATOR
Frame Assemblies and BOMs
By default, Frame Generator parts are set to calculate their base quantity from the length of the 
part. This differs from standard parts that calculate their base quantity from the number of 
parts in the assembly. When parts are authored for use in Frame Generator, the Base Quantity 
setting is automatically set to the length. To get a part count in the parts list for your assemblies, 
you will want to confi gure them to read the item quantity rather than the base quantity. You can 
use both columns if that fi ts your needs, or you can have the BOM display one quantity and the 
parts list display the other.
You can also use the BOM expression builder to create a description built off the Stock Number 
property and GL parameter (Length). You can use the CUTDETAIL parameters in expressions to 
show the end treatment information for each member. Note that you can copy the expression 
in one cell of the BOM, multiselect the rest of the column, and then right-click and choose Paste 
to set the expression to all of the parts in the BOM. Figure 15.41 shows the BOM Editor list-
ing the base quantity and the item quantity along with an expression being built to fi ll out the 
description.
Figure 15.41
Using the BOM 
expression builder
It is a good idea to let Frame Generator name the frame members for you and use the Part 
Number property rather than the part name to manage the parts. Once you’ve set an expression 
as just described, you can sort the BOM by that column to group the like items, set one of the 
part numbers, multiselect the items, and choose Paste from the context menu to set them 
all the same. If you want the items to be merged, leave the Part Number Merge Settings options 
selected. The Part Number Merge Settings button is in the top right of the BOM Editor 
dialog box.
In the drawing environment, use a Parts List style similar to the default Material List style 
found in the standard templates. This parts list is already confi gured to group by stock number 
and material, as well as sum the values of each unique stock number type. Figure 15.42 shows a 
parts list placed using the Material List style to roll up the lengths.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 749
Th e Bottom Line
Work with frame fi les.  Frame Generator puts all the members at the same level in the 
assembly.
Master It  You have a frame that is built up in sections that are welded together. How do 
you document the manufacturing process?
Insert frame members onto a skeleton model.  Frame Generator builds a skeleton model for 
the frame from the selected lines and edges.
Master It  Since Frame Generator builds its own skeleton model, you don’t have to build 
a master model before you start creating the frame. What would you reference in your 
assembly to use as a frame skeleton?
Add end treatments to frame members.  Frame Generator does not support end treatments 
on merged members.
Master It  Let’s assume you are building a stairway and the handrail has curved sec-
tions. How would you approach the curved handrail so that its ends can be treated?
Make changes to frames.  Inventor provides detailed frame-member information.

Chapter 16
Inventor Studio
The means to communicate your design to sell your concept or product is valuable whether 
your customer is internal or external to your company. Visualization, through static imagery or 
animation, has the potential to improve that communication by providing your customers with 
a conceptual or practical demonstration of your design. Inventor Studio, a rendering and ani-
mation environment in the Autodesk® Inventor® program, is a visualization tool built into the 
assembly and part environments.
With Inventor Studio, you can create and apply appearance styles that enhance the realism 
of your components and create lighting styles that draw attention to specifi c aspects of your 
design. Inventor Studio comes with many surface styles and a modest set of lighting and scene 
styles to use. You can modify the delivered styles or make as many new ones as you need. The 
goal is to make your image as true to your concept as you want.
Inventor Studio uses assembly constraints and positional representations for animation 
purposes. You can animate a single part or an assembly. This chapter will discuss how to use 
Inventor Studio to create the images and animations that communicate your design to the 
targeted audience.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Create and animate cameras
 
◆
Start new animations, modify animations, and use the various animation tools
 
◆
Use multiple cameras to create a video production of your animation
 
◆
Use props to enhance your scene
 
◆
Render shaded and illustrative images
 
◆
Render animations and video productions
Exploring the Inventor Studio Environment
The Inventor Studio environment contains the tools required for creating realistic imagery and 
animations of mechanistic movement. This section will introduce you to the various tools, envi-
ronment settings, and browser in the Inventor Studio environment.
Before entering Inventor Studio, you may want to consider what you will be using as 
resources (diffuse maps, bump maps, decals, and so on) for your images. Inventor comes with 
a collection of diffuse and bump maps, but if you have any images for textures or bump maps, 

752 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
you should include the directories where these fi les reside in your project fi le. Doing so ensures 
that those resources will be available when you work in Inventor Studio. Then, plan ahead by 
storyboarding your animation, giving thought to camera positions and settings, lighting, and 
animation.
To enter the Inventor Studio environment from either a part fi le or an assembly fi le, select the 
Environments tab and click the Inventor Studio button, shown in Figure 16.1.
Figure 16.1
Accessing Inventor 
Studio
This will set the Render tab active along the top of the graphics area, and it opens the 
Inventor Studio Scene browser in place of the Model browser. The Render tab is divided into 
four panels organized by task—Render, Scene, Animate, and Manage—each containing tools for 
those tasks. Figure 16.2 shows the Render tab.
Figure 16.2
Th e Render tab in 
Inventor Studio
The Scene browser is a custom browser that contains folder nodes specifi c to Inventor Studio. 
Right-clicking a folder node allows you to create one or more productions, animations, cameras, 
and local lights within the same fi le. The instances are maintained in the corresponding folder.
Creating and Managing Styles
Three types of styles are used in Inventor Studio: appearance, lighting, and scene styles. Each 
has a different purpose and contributes to the fi nal image you produce. Lighting and scene 
styles are created and modifi ed using tools specifi c to the Inventor Studio environment, whereas 
appearance styles are created and modifi ed using the same tools used in the rest of Autodesk 
Inventor.
Applying Appearance Styles
Appearance styles are used to create and modify colors, patterns, and textures for your compo-
nents. The appearance styles interface has a variety of controls to assign colors, patterns, and 
textures to the model based on selected faces or features or to the entire component.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 753
Applying Appearance Adjustments and Overrides per Face
It’s often useful to apply a color or texture to specifi c faces in order to achieve a more realistic 
appearance. To do so, you can use any of these methods:
Right-Click  Select a face on the model and then right-click and choose Properties. Then 
select an appearance from the drop-down list.
Quick Access Toolbar  Select a face on the model and then use the Appearance Override 
drop-down list on the Quick Access toolbar at the top of the screen.
Appearance Adjust Button  Select a face on the model and then click the Appearance 
Adjust button on the Tools tab.
The Appearance Adjust button provides more control in applying the override than just 
simply changing the appearance color and texture. When you click the Appearance Adjust but-
ton, you are presented with the Adjust in-canvas tools, as shown in Figure 16.3.
Figure 16.3
Th e Appearance 
Adjust tools
Using the Adjust Appearances Drop-Down List
Once the Appearance Adjust tools are displayed, you can use the drop-down list to select an 
existing appearance style to use for the selected face. The Inventor project fi le (.ipj) specifi es 
the material and appearance libraries that are accessible from the list.
Using the Tinting Color Wheel
Once you select an appearance style, you can click and drag the color wheel to apply a color tint 
override. As you do so, the RGB values will adjust and be shown in the controls. Alternatively, 
you can set the controls to use HSL values. Once a color is selected using the color wheel, you 
can click and drag the crosshairs located in the center of the color wheel to adjust the brightness 
of the color tint.
Using the Scale and Rotate Controls
If the selected appearance uses a texture, you can use the scale and rotate controls displayed on 
the selected face to adjust the angle and size of the texture. These controls highlight as you place 
your cursor over them and are shown on the left of Figure 16.3.
If you want to adjust the appearance of multiple faces at the same time, you can press and 
hold the Ctrl key on the keyboard and then click each face. To accept the adjustments you’ve 
made, click the Apply button (the green plus sign) or the green check mark. If you want to dis-
card the adjustments, you can click the Cancel button (the red X).
Keep in mind that the option to display textures must be enabled in order to see the scale and 
rotation of appearance textures. You can enable and disable the display of textures by selecting 
the View tab and clicking the Textures On/Off drop-down menu.

754 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Clearing Appearance Adjustments and Overrides
To remove appearance overrides, you can click the Clear button on the Material And 
Appearance panel of the Tools tab, as shown in Figure 16.4.
Figure 16.4
Use the Clear but-
ton to remove 
appearance 
overrides.
Once the Clear controls are active, you can select the faces from which you want to clear 
existing appearance overrides, or you can use the Clear All button to remove all appearance 
overrides and set the model to use the appearance style assigned to the current material.
Applying Appearance Adjustments per Feature, Solid, or Part
In addition to applying appearance overrides to faces, you can apply them to specifi c features. 
To do so, select the Tools tab and click the Adjust button. Then, from the browser, select the 
feature to be adjusted. The Adjust and Clear controls work in the same way with features as 
they do with faces.
To apply adjustments to an entire solid, select the outer edge, or select it in the browser when 
you are working in the part modeling environment. To select the entire part when in the part 
modeling environment, select the top-level node in the browser.
When working with an assembly fi le, you can choose individual parts to apply adjustments 
to by selecting them on-screen or in the browser. To apply adjustments to entire subassemblies, 
select the subassembly from the browser. Clearing appearance adjustments in the assembly 
environment works the same as it does in the part environment.
Appearance Styles vs. Material Styles
You might be wondering about the diﬀ erence between an appearance style and a material style. 
A material style contains information about the physical properties of a material and speciﬁ es a 
default appearance style. For instance, a material style called Aluminum 5052-O might use an 
appearance style called Aluminum Polished. Th erefore, the material style consumes the appear-
ance style. When you apply appearance adjustments to the model, it is as if you are painting the 
various surfaces and features, but the model is still using the original material to determine its 
physical properties.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 755
Creating Appearance Styles and Appearance Libraries
To create or modify appearance styles, you can click the Appearance button on the Tools tab. 
This will open the Appearance Browser, as shown in Figure 16.5.
Figure 16.5
Th e Appearance 
Browser
At the top is the Document Appearances area, showing the appearances cached in the active 
model. Listed below are the Autodesk Material Library, the Autodesk Appearance Library, and 
any custom libraries that exist. To create a custom library or custom appearance style, you can 
use the buttons located at the bottom-left corner of the appearance browser.
When creating a custom appearance, you set the properties using the Appearance Editor, as 
shown in Figure 16.6.
Figure 16.6
Creating a custom 
appearance
Exploring Lighting and Lighting Styles
Several lighting styles are provided with Inventor, and you can use them as is or modify them 
to meet your needs. You can also create new lighting styles to suit your needs. Lighting styles 

756 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
differ from appearance and scene styles. Lighting styles have settings that affect all lights in the 
style, and individual lights have settings for only the selected light. However, you can set indi-
vidual lights to use the style settings to allow consistent control across multiple lights.
In the Inventor Studio environment, on the Render tab you’ll fi nd the Lighting Styles tool. 
Click to activate it and display the Lighting Styles dialog box. The New Light button (the light-
bulb at the top of the dialog box) adds a new light to the selected lighting style. The New Light 
dialog box appears, and you can specify the settings.
Next, you’ll explore the light styles and what they control.
Lighting Styles
The lighting style settings affect all lights in the style. In the Lighting Styles dialog box, a list of 
lighting styles is presented on the left. Each style has a set of controls:
 
◆
Brightness
 
◆
Skylight
 
◆
Ambience
 
◆
Bounced Light
 
◆
Shadows
 
◆
Orientation
 
◆
Scale
 
◆
Position
Note that the active style, currently displayed in the scene and used for rendering, is listed 
with bold letters, and the selected style, the one whose settings are exposed for editing, has 
background fi ll, as shown in Figure 16.7. You can double-click a style in the list to edit it. The 
style does not have to be the active one.
Figure 16.7
Active and selected 
styles
Selected
Active
Besides the common style tools, you’ll also see a New Light tool in the tools area of the 
Lighting Styles dialog box. This tool adds a new light to the lighting style you have selected in 
the list. The new light is then made the active edit target so you can complete the defi nition.
Th e General Tab
Brightness, on the General tab of the Lighting Styles dialog box, controls the overall style bright-
ness. This tool affects all lights in the style.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 757
Skylight is the tool that provides uniform, directionless illumination in the scene. When 
it’s enabled, you are able to specify light intensity and color, or you can use an image for light-
ing the scene. The image supplies colors for the lighting but should not be confused with high 
dynamic range image (HDRI) illumination.
Using the Skylight and Bounced Light tools is computationally intensive, and therefore they 
should be used sparingly, usually for fi nal renders only.
Th e Indirect Tab
On the Indirect tab, the Ambience setting controls the amount of ambient light used in the 
scene. Setting the value higher increases the amount of light in the scene, so if you have a scene 
that is lit but is too dark and needs a minor adjustment to get more light, try increasing the 
Ambience setting.
The Bounced Light setting is a component of global lighting and is included when the 
Skylight option is selected. However, you can use Bounced Light without the Skylight option. 
Bounced Light provides the lighting that comes from objects as light encounters them and then 
refl ects off the surfaces. With Bounced Light, you have the option of using preset values for the 
number of rays that are sampled for bounced lighting. There is also a custom setting should you 
decide you need a value other than those provided.
Th e Shadows Tab
The Shadows tab provides access to the following:
Type  You can specify None, Sharp, and Soft.
Quality  You can specify Low, Medium, and High.
Density  You can specify 0 to 100 percent.
Light Parameter  Here, you specify the spherical diameter for a soft shadow effect.
If the light casts no shadow, the Type should be set to None, and all other controls on the 
page are disabled and not used.
Sharp shadows provide a well-defi ned shadow. The boundaries of an object defi ne a sharp 
contrast between shadow and nonshadow areas.
Soft shadows blur the area between shadow and nonshadow areas. The Light Parameter 
setting, available only for soft shadows, defi nes the spherical diameter of infl uence for soft 
shadows.
Figure 16.8 shows a comparison of the three shadow types: None, Sharp, and Soft.
Figure 16.8
Shadow types: 
None, Sharp, 
and Soft
Note that the Light Parameter setting controls the penumbra (dispersing area around the 
darkest part of the shadow) and that it is a diameter dimension.

758 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Shadow density provides an additional level of control because you can set the density 
on a per-light basis. As Figure 16.9 shows, the shadow density increases with the value of the 
parameter.
Figure 16.9
Shadow density 
at 15, 45, and 75 
percent
It is easy to see how by working with these settings you can greatly affect the results of your 
rendered image or animation.
As mentioned earlier, the Light Parameter setting is a spherical diameter value that controls 
the infl uence of soft shadows. If you want soft shadows around the whole scene, the sphere must 
be set to be somewhat larger than the scene. If the infl uence is to be limited, you can use a lower 
setting. A good rule of thumb is to estimate the extents of your assembly and add 10 to 15 per-
cent for a reasonable penumbra.
Th e Position Tab
The Position tab gives you access to the orientation, scale, and location of the lighting style.
Orientation is derived from one of the following:
Canonical Origin Planes  XY plane, XZ plane, YZ plane.
Scene Style Ground Planes  Available in the drop-down list.
Any Model Face or Work Plane  Use the Select button.
If you want to reverse the lighting style orientation, you can use the Flip button next to the 
drop-down list and invert the direction of the lighting style.
Scale affects all lights in the style. This allows you to quickly modify your lighting style to fi t 
the model conditions. You can specify any scale factor from 1 to 1000 percent.
Lighting style position is expressed in model units and is based on the center of the top-level 
assembly. If you want to relocate the entire style, the position settings allow you to easily reposi-
tion the lighting style.
Adding a New Light
To add a new light to an existing style, use the New Light tool in the dialog box or context menu 
in the light style list. Then follow these steps to produce a new light:
 
1. Specify a face to act as the light target and normal. The face selection determines the light 
target location and beam direction.
 
2. After selecting a face, you’ll see a straight line proceeding from the target or face; drag 
your mouse pointer along that line to defi ne the light position.
 
3. In the dialog box, modify the light parameters to fi t your needs.
If you adjust the settings before defi ning the position, return to the General tab and select the 
Target or Position tool to begin specifying the light position interactively.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 759
Creating a New Lighting Style
You can create new lighting styles in three ways:
 
◆
Use the New Lighting Style tool, which is also available from the list context menu. The 
new lighting style contains one each of the three light types with default values.
 
◆
Copy an existing lighting style. Then edit it to suit your needs.
 
◆
Import a lighting style from a fi le.
When you create a new lighting style, you are provided with each of the three types of dis-
crete lights. You can change the light types, add more lights, and modify parameters to achieve 
the lighting effect you want.
If you copy an existing lighting style, you are able to rename it, modify the parameters, add 
new lights, or change the light types for the existing lights.
If you have an exported lighting style that you want to import and use, you can use the 
Import tool, which is the button at the bottom of the dialog box; navigate to the appropriate fi le 
and then import it. Be advised, though, that if you import a lighting style with the same name as 
an existing lighting style, the imported style will overwrite the current, same-named style.
Discrete Lights
In the Lighting Styles dialog box, you can create and edit individual discrete lights for each light 
style by using the New Light button. When you create a new light, the tabs in the Lighting Style 
dialog box refl ect the settings for that light rather than the style. Discrete lights can be one of 
three types: directional, point, or spotlight. Certain controls for the discrete light types differ 
from the style controls, but shadow parameters can be linked to the style and managed globally 
for the style from the Shadows tab of the Lighting Style dialog box.
Discrete lights, though three different types, all have only one set of parameters. Based on 
the light type, access to invalid parameters is blocked. This provides a distinct ease-of-use fea-
ture: the ability to switch between light types without having to delete and re-create new ones. 
You can experiment with different light types quickly and determine which is best for your 
circumstances.
A point light sends light in every direction, whereas the spotlight can be pointed and focused 
on an area of interest. As you work with lights, experiment so that you learn their characteristics 
and are able to easily add the type of light you want to a scene.
Th e General Tab
When you create a new light or select an existing light to edit, you’ll see the options on the 
General tab become specifi c to that light. On the General tab, you’re able to do the following:
 
◆
You can defi ne the light type; you can choose Directional, Point, or Spot.
 
◆
You can set the on/off condition. This condition can be animated.
 
◆
You can redefi ne the position and, for the Directional and Spot types, the target.
 
◆
You can fl ip the light, reversing the target and position locations.
You can copy and paste lights, so once you’ve set one up, you can quickly duplicate it. You 
cannot create patterns of lights.

760 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Th e Illumination Tab
The Illumination tab contains controls for light color and intensity. Intensity is a percentage 
value from 0 to 100 percent.
Light color, as most people realize, helps inject emotion into a scene. Warm colors (yellows, 
oranges, reds, and so on) evoke a different response than do cool colors (blues, greens, and so 
on). Let’s say you want light in the scene but would like to give the impression it is turned off at 
a certain point. However, you want enough light to see the scene clearly. How can you achieve 
this? Instead of actually turning the light off, you could change the color and intensity of the 
light from yellow at 80 percent to light blue at 30 percent, giving the impression the light is off 
while still illuminating the scene.
Th e Shadows Tab
The Shadows tab for discrete lights duplicates the style Shadows tab. Thus, the shadows of any 
discrete light can be linked to the style shadows and derived from there. If you choose to have 
the selected light use different settings, deselect the Use Style Settings check box. Then specify 
the settings for the selected light.
Th e Directional Tab
Directional lights provide parallel beams of light from a single direction. The light source is 
considered an infi nite distance away. Thus, you could use directional light to simulate sunshine. 
The positional information for a directional light is defi ned by longitude and latitude values.
The longitude and latitude controls easily relate to seasonal positioning for lighting. You 
need to be familiar with where the seasonal lighting is for your geography.
Directional lights do not participate in soft shadow lighting. The control is disabled for any 
directional light.
Th e Point Tab
Point lights cast light in all directions and therefore have only position parameters for locating 
the light. The light target is ignored and, for all intents and purposes, is considered as traveling 
with the light position. Position values are listed in absolute X, Y, and Z values based on the top-
level assembly origin.
The light decay controls apply to point lights and spotlights only. These controls have an 
impact on how real the lighting looks. There are three decay types:
None  This option specifi es that light energy will not decay over distance. If you want 
indirect light to remain constant throughout the scene, regardless of the distance between 
objects, use this setting.
Inverse  Light energy decays at a rate proportional to the distance traveled. Photon energy 
is 1/r, where r is the distance from the light source.
Inverse Squared  Light energy decays at an inverse square rate. Photon energy is the 
inverse of the square of the distance from the light source—that is, 1/r2.
In the real world, light decays at an inverse square rate. However, for lighting to be realistic, 
the light values must also be real-world accurate. You’ll fi nd that it takes more lights to amply 
light a scene when you use Inverse Squared for decay.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 761
The rendering cost, in time, increases as you move from no decay to Inverse and again from 
Inverse to Inverse Squared. For most renders, you can use None or Inverse and get good results 
based on how you set up your lighting style. When using light decay, you are able to specify 
the distance from the light source when the decay begins to occur. The greater the decay start 
distance, the brighter the light will appear to be. This means that if you have a lighting style you 
prefer but want to make it less bright in some areas, you can change specifi c lights to use Inverse 
decay and have a considerable effect on the output. Light decay is a setting that takes experi-
mentation to get a feel for when and how to use it.
Th e Spot Tab
Spotlights provide light in a more focused manner, at a specifi c location. For spotlights, there are 
more controls for adjusting the light parameters. You can do the following:
 
◆
Explicitly position the light target or light source
 
◆
Specify the light hotspot and falloff
 
◆
Specify the light decay type and start distance
As discussed thus far, you can modify lighting styles, giving explicit values for input. For 
example, you can edit position, target, hotspot, and falloff interactively.
To modify any of these settings, you must fi rst edit the light you intend to change. Place your 
mouse pointer over the light graphic, which is the light node in the Scene browser, and right-
click; then select Edit from the context menu. At this point, place your mouse pointer over the 
graphical representation of the element you want to edit, and do one of the following:
 
◆
Click the light source to display the 3D Move/Rotate tool for modifying the position or 
target.
 
◆
Click and drag the graphic representing the hotspot or falloff to change its size.
 
◆
Click the line representing the light beam; it connects the position graphic to the target 
graphic. The 3D Move/Rotate triad is placed over the center of the line, enabling a reposi-
tion of the entire light. Click and drag the arrow to move the light in that direction.
Local Lights
Local lights are discrete lights that belong to the scene, but not the lighting style. They are use-
ful for control panel lights, for example, that you may want to animate individually. Thus, local 
lights come only in the Spot or Point light type. Local lights travel with components, so if you 
create a lightbulb component, you can specify a local light for use with the bulb object.
Local lights use the same controls as discrete style lights. In fact, you can easily create a local 
light by right-clicking any style-based discrete light and selecting the tool in the context menu.
Local light settings and position can be animated only when the light is at the top level of the 
assembly or part model.
Exploring the Scene Styles Dialog Box
Scene styles provide a backdrop for your scene. You can use a single solid color, a gradient color, 
an image, or a spherical image. What you use depends on how you want to compose your scene.

762 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Scene styles provide a built-in ground plane that eliminates the need for you to add geometry 
in the model to provide the illusion of ground or a surface on which your assembly is sitting. 
However, if you have specifi c needs or use props that replace the ground plane, then it is not 
necessary to show shadows or refl ection. The Scene Styles tool is located in the tool panel next to 
the Lighting Styles tool.
Looking at the Background Tab
The Background tab provides access to the various controls for specifying the type of back-
ground and location of images to use. You can forgo specifying any of this information by 
selecting the Use Application Options check box. The current Inventor background will be used. 
You can choose from four background types, covered next.
Solid Color
If you want to use a single color for the background, click the Solid Color button, and specify the 
color to use in the Colors section.
You could use the Solid Color option to produce an image so that the background could be 
removed or specifi ed as a transparent color. However, there is a much easier method that I’ll dis-
cuss when it comes time to render images, in the section “Composing and Rendering Images” 
later in this chapter.
Color Gradient
Color Gradient is a popular choice because it has the potential to look more like a presentation. 
Both color controls become enabled, and you specify the top and bottom gradient colors, respec-
tively. With the environment controls, you can further tune the background, using shadows and 
refl ection, to make the scene style complement your model.
Experiment with different solutions. You’ll fi nd some really nice sets of colors that work well 
together. For example, the use of dark blue (top) and black (bottom), with refl ections on and set 
to 80 percent, looks elegant with the proper lighting.
Image
The Image setting enables the image controls at the bottom section of the dialog box. When you 
activate this choice, the Open dialog box is automatically displayed so you can select the desired 
image. The default location for the image choices is the Textures directory that is created and 
populated during the Inventor installation. If you plan to use images other than those supplied, 
you should do one of two things:
 
◆
Edit the project fi le to include the directory where the images are located as a library. (This 
is recommended.)
 
◆
Place any image you will use in the installed Textures directory.
Figure 16.10 demonstrates the use of the forest 2.bmp background image (installed by 
default to the Inventor install directory, such as C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\
Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Backgrounds). This background contains a green backdrop with a 
receding grid ground plane. The proper placement of the assembly relative to the background 
enhances the end product. Be sure to take the time to analyze your background to see what 

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 763
may need to be adjusted to optimize your output. In this instance, a lower camera angle was 
used, and shadows were turned on in the scene style. The lighting style was set to produce soft 
shadows.
Figure 16.10
A scene style 
with an image 
background
When the Image setting is enabled, you have three choices of how to use the image in the 
scene. You can center, tile, or stretch the image. If you choose to tile the image, the Repeat con-
trols are enabled for your use. A little later, in the section “Matching Your Camera to an Image,” 
you’ll learn how to match the model view to your image.
Image Sphere
If you use the Image Sphere option, the selected image is mapped to an environment sphere. 
The image is stretched to map to the sphere.
Looking at the Environment Tab
The Environment tab manages the ground plane orientation, shadows, refl ection, and environ-
ment mapping.
Direction and Oﬀ set
The scene style ground plane orientation is based on one of the three canonical assembly work 
planes. Select the orientation you desire and specify an offset, if any is required, to position the 
plane at the proper height for your model. Negative values position the ground plane below the 
assembly plane to which it is parallel.
Show Shadows
The option to show shadows is useful when the scene style is acting like a ground plane for the 
assembly—in other words, not using any prop models or other models to serve as a fl oor. The 
Show Shadows setting specifi es whether shadows are cast on the scene-style ground plane.
Show Reﬂ ections
If your scene style is serving the purpose of a model ground plane and you want to refl ect the 
model in the ground plane, select the Show Refl ections option and adjust the percentage of 
refl ection you want in the rendered image. The higher the number, the more refl ection you see 

764 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
in the ground plane. If set to 100 percent, it will refl ect the assembly as if it were sitting on 
a mirror.
Reﬂ ection Image
The Use Refl ection Image setting is there for you to specify an environment image map. This 
is the image you will see refl ected in those parts that have refl ectance in their surface style 
when rendered. Depending on the image, it can have minor to major infl uence on the rendered 
outcome. Here again, experimentation is the best teacher.
Collect or produce a set of widely different images, and make new scene styles using the 
images for refl ection mapping. Render the same model with the different styles to see what sort 
of infl uence the image produces.
Matching Your Camera to an Image
If you want to match your model to a photograph, use the Image Background type for the scene 
style. Analyze the photo you will use for the background. Determine where the light is com-
ing from and how much shadow is being cast. Then, set your view to use a perspective camera. 
Orient the model so that its horizon and vanishing point are similar to the image. Next, create or 
modify a lighting style so that it produces light and shadows similar to those in the photo. Do a 
few test renders and refi ne the camera position and lights until you’re able to get something that 
looks like what you want.
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 16 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/
masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction 
for the download and setup instructions.
Here’s an example of the workfl ow you can use:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_16a_001.ipt located in the Chapter 16 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and click the Open button.
 
3. Select an image and make a scene style using the Image background type. You can use 
the mountain background image mi_16a_001.tif in the Chapter 16 directory.
 
4. Orient the model, as shown in Figure 16.11, to look like it fi ts into the scene.
Figure 16.11

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 765
 
5. Use the Outdoor lighting style, and scale it to fi t the scene. To make sure the shadows are 
close, modify the style orientation to match the shadow angles on the mountains. Do a 
test render, make a couple of tweaks to the style position, and then render the image, as 
shown in Figure 16.12.
Figure 16.12
Platform with 
background
In the next example, Figure 16.13, an existing Inventor background image was used and cen-
tered in the scene. This time, the goal was to produce an image for marketing purposes. The 
model was oriented in a way that made it emerge from the image and made it large enough to 
extend beyond the background image, giving the illusion that it protrudes from the image.
Figure 16.13
Scene style example
Composing and Rendering Images
Although it is good to know how to use the tools to produce styles, it is also important to know 
the purpose of the image you are composing and rendering. What is its use? Who is the target 
audience? The type of image you compose and render will be different based on the answers to 
those questions. For example, if you are producing imagery for an assembly or repair manual 

766 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
used by technicians, you may elect to use an illustration style of output as opposed to a realis-
tic style. The noncritical content may be simplifi ed to a degree. However, if you are presenting 
a product to a group of investors or potential customers, you may want to compose an image 
showing the product in its anticipated environment. The use of props can add context to your 
image or animation and possibly add more realism.
Since you are using an engineering assembly to create an image, it is likely you do not want 
to alter the engineering models for the sake of the image—that is, you don’t want to add extra 
“stage prop” content to engineering models. So, the recommended step is to place the product 
model into a wrapper assembly. Wrapper assemblies are simply a level higher, include the engi-
neering assembly, and can contain nonengineering content that serves as props for composing 
the fi nal rendered images or animations. Let’s say you are producing a product that is used in a 
machine shop. You place the product’s fi nal assembly in a wrapper assembly and add shop con-
tent, such as walls, tables, tools, and so on, to set the stage for the rendered image or animation, 
as shown in Figure 16.14.
Figure 16.14
A wrapper assembly 
with props
As you can see, there is nonessential content in the scene, but when combined, those items 
contribute to communicating a purpose for the items in the image. Even the surface style on the 
tabletop evokes a sense of a well-used workbench. It is small touches such as these that enhance 
your images.
Creating and Using Cameras
Although you might conclude that cameras would be best used for animations, they are also 
useful for working with images. Cameras make it easy to recall view orientation, and they can 
be animated. There are two methods for creating cameras: using the Camera tool and using the 
view context menu.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 767
Th e Camera Tool
To use the Camera tool, located on the Render tab, do the following:
 
1. Click the Camera tool.
 
2. Select the target, a component face. The camera direction line is presented normal to the 
face preview and selection. Click to select the target. The tool then cycles to the camera-
position input.
 
3. Specify the camera position by moving the mouse pointer along the camera direction line 
and then moving it along the line. When the preview is satisfactory, click to select the 
camera position.
 
4. If you select the Link Camera To View check box, the camera graphics are hidden, and 
the view is changed to what the camera sees. When the check box is deselected, the cam-
era graphics are restored. This gives you an easy way to check your settings.
 
5. Set the Camera Zoom value to fi t your requirements.
 
6. Depth Of Field provides two methods of setting the range of focus: Focus Limits and 
f-Stop. Click the Enable option and then choose one of the Depth Of Field methods of set-
ting the range of focus: Focus Limits or f-Stop.
The Focus Limits setting provides you with near and far values, in model units. Content 
between the near and far values will be in focus. Content outside those values will be 
proportionally out of focus. f-Stop, the other method, uses an f-Stop value and a Focus 
Plane setting.
To make setting up the camera a little easier, you can link the focus plane to the camera 
target. Then, whenever the target is moved, the depth of fi eld adjusts to fi t with the cam-
era. That makes less work when it comes to updates.
 
7. Click the OK button, and the camera is created. You can rename the camera with the 
browser node slow-click method.
Current View
The graphic region context menu method is useful for rapidly creating a camera using the cur-
rent view. To access the other camera settings, you must edit the camera after creating it. To use 
the graphic-region context menu method, simply orient the view so it displays what you want 
the camera to show, right-click, and click Create Camera From View. A camera is added for this 
position. You can edit the other camera parameters via the Camera dialog box.
It is not unusual to have eight to ten cameras defi ned when you consider the various vantage 
points from which you might look at a product.

768 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Rendering Images
Now that the stage is set, the lighting selected, and the model positioned, you’re probably anx-
ious to render something to see how it’s coming. You can always render using the current view. 
Whatever position you set the view to, you can render and get results. It is not required that you 
have a camera defi ned to render. However, repeatedly getting back to that same camera location, 
settings, and so on, requires that you defi ne a camera. So, before discussing rendering, here is a 
brief description of setting up a camera.
The easiest method, by far, is to orient your model, choose orthographic or perspective view-
ing, and, then in the graphic region, right-click and select Create Camera From View. That’s it! 
You have defi ned a camera. Now you can easily recall that camera if you change the view orien-
tation. As you can in any Inventor browser, you can click the node twice and rename it. I recom-
mend naming your cameras for ease in selecting, recalling, or animating them.
The Render Image tool presents the Render Image dialog box with three tabs: General, 
Output, and Style. The following sections will briefl y discuss the controls and use of the Render 
Image tool.
General Tab
The General tab contains controls for sizing the image and for specifying the camera, lighting 
style, scene style, and render type to use in producing the image. Active styles prepopulate the 
style choice fi elds.
The size controls, Width and Height, provide you with explicit image size control. Directly to 
the right is a drop-down list of predefi ned image sizes that are typical in the industry. Beneath 
the drop-down list is a check box for locking the image aspect ratio. If you determine that a spe-
cifi c image size is consistently used, you can enter the values, lock the aspect ratio, and then cre-
ate images at that ratio or at any size within the permitted limits. This makes scaling an image, 
postrendering, easy.
As mentioned earlier, the camera choices include those you have defi ned and Current View. 
If you are doing test renders at a low resolution by moving the camera around to see where the 
best shot will be taken from, use Current View. It’s simple and straightforward. Once you deter-
mine the camera locations, you can then defi ne and refi ne those positions and camera settings.
The Lighting Style drop-down list shows all the available lighting styles, local (document) 
styles, and global styles (the style library), including those you have made and maintained 
locally or in the style library. If you have activated a lighting style, it is preselected. Specify the 
desired lighting style.
As with the lighting style, you make your selection based on available local and global styles.
As you were composing the scene, you likely determined whether the end result would be 
rendered as a shaded or illustration image. Here is where you set that choice. The choice dictates 
what controls are available on the Style tab.
Th e Output Tab
The Output tab contains controls for where the image is saved and whether to use antialiasing 
and to what extent to use it.
If you want to save the image, select the Save Rendered Image box. When you do so, the Save 
dialog box appears. You specify the location and name for the image. If you don’t specify this in 
advance, you are still able to save the image from the render window.

CREATING AND MANAGING STYLES | 769
Output PNG Files with a Transparent Background
If you set the ﬁ le output type to PNG and then click the Options button, you can select the Alpha 
Channel check box. Doing so sets the image background to transparent, allowing the image to be 
composited easily in a photo-editing application. Th is is often useful when preparing images for 
brochures and presentations.
The antialiasing tools include the following choices, from left to right:
None  Antialiasing is not used. This selection requires the least render time and provides 
the coarsest results.
Low  This option specifi es a low antialiasing setting. This eliminates the major coarseness 
seen in the None selection but still displays a degree of coarseness.
High  This option specifi es a high antialiasing setting. This setting virtually eliminates all 
signs of coarseness in the image. For fi nal renders, in scenes without soft shadows, this selec-
tion performs very well.
Highest  This option specifi es the highest antialiasing setting. This setting is provided 
particularly for use with refi ning the image’s soft shadows.
With each selection there is an increase in quality accompanied by an increase in render 
time. Thus, when you select the Highest setting, recommended for soft shadow use only, the 
quality is increased, as is rendering time. It is up to you to determine what meets your need.
Style Tab
When you’re using the Shaded style, there is only one control on the Style tab: True Refl ections. 
When selected, this option ensures that the objects in the scene are seen in refl ective surfaces. If 
it’s not selected, the image map specifi ed in the surface style or scene style is used. When you’re 
using the Illustration style, several settings yield a variety of results. To render a line-art illustra-
tion like you might see in a technical or assembly manual, do the following:
 
1. Set the graphics display to use the Presentation color scheme with the background 
set to one color. Color scheme selection can be set by selecting the Tools tab, clicking 
Applications Options, and selecting the Colors tab in the dialog box that opens.
 
2. In Inventor Studio, set up the model conditions to fi t your requirements. If you want to 
show something during the course of the movement, use an animation and select a time 
position that illustrates the condition.
 
3. Activate the Render Image tool and specify the Render Type setting as Illustration.
 
4. On the Style tab, set Color Fill Source to No Color, as shown in Figure 16.15. Since there 
is no color, you likely want the exterior and interior edges to show. Select both options in 
the Edges section.

770 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO

5. Render the scene. The results will be something like Figure 16.16.
Figure 16.16

Take some time to experiment with these settings, and you will be able to come up with some 
interesting imagery. For example, make the following changes to the Illustration rendering type 
settings:
 
1. On the Style tab, set Color Fill Source to Surface Style.
 
2. Set Levels to 5 (midway across the slider).
 
3. Select the Show Shiny Highlights option.
 
4. On the General tab, set the lighting style to Table Top.
 
5. Render the scene. The results will look something like Figure 16.17.

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 771

As you can see, with just a few changes, you can get dramatic differences. Using the same 
settings, render the scene with a different scene style. The results really start to get interesting.
Animating with Inventor Studio
Inventor Studio was designed to use Assembly constraints to produce the mechanistic move-
ment within your assemblies. You should consider the following basic concepts when it comes 
to animating with Inventor Studio:
 
◆
When you enter the Inventor Studio environment, the model is considered to be in model 
state, that is, whatever the condition the model was in when you left the part or assembly 
environment. This means that when you exit Inventor Studio, modify the assembly, and 
then reenter Inventor Studio, the assembly changes are refl ected in the model state. That 
includes view representations, positional representations, component visibility, position, 
color, and so on. For animations, the model state represents frame 0. Therefore, all modifi -
cations affecting the model state also affect all animations in that document because 
frame 0 has changed.
 
◆
Modifi cations made in frame 0 of the animation become the starting point for that anima-
tion. For example, component 1 in animation 1 is fl ush with component 2. In animation 2, 
the fl ush constraint for component 1 is offset by 1.5”. By changing the constraint in frame 0 
for animation 2, you don’t cause a change in animation 1. Had you changed the fl ush offset 
in the assembly or Inventor Studio model state, animation 1 would also be affected.
 
◆
Because Inventor Studio animates constraints, the free-form movement of a component, 
part, or assembly may require suppressing constraints that limit movement or the compo-
nent’s degrees of freedom.
 
◆
Animation actions are a result of modifying constraints; thus, any component that is con-
strained to a moving object will also move.
 
◆
The Animation Favorites folder contains all the constraints that have been animated in 
the active animation. It also contains any parameters you have nominated to appear there. 

772 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
This makes it easier to locate any parameters intended for animation and those constraints 
that have been animated.
 
◆
There is a common workfl ow through the Animation dialog boxes—specify the animation 
parameters and specify the time parameters. Based on the animation action target (compo-
nent, light, camera), the dialog box presents controls relative to the target.
 
◆
To edit an animation action, you use the same dialog box and therefore virtually the same 
workfl ow.
Using Animation Tools
All animation tools are applicable to assemblies. However, in part models, only cameras, lights, 
and parameters can be animated. The Render tab is divided into panels. Animation tools are 
grouped on the Animation panel.
Using Animation Timeline
You can fi nd the Animation Timeline tool on the Animate panel of the Render tab. The ani-
mation timeline is where animation actions for any object are maintained and managed. 
Anytime you use an animate tool, it results in an animation action that is placed in the timeline. 
Animation actions can be interactively changed using the start or end handle; you can also use 
the action’s location along the timeline by using the middle section of the action graphic or by 
editing the animation action.
To edit an animation action, use the action’s context menu, or double-click the action graphic 
in the timeline.
The playback tools are along the top left of the window. These are similar to other timeline or 
video playback controls you have used. Figure 16.18 shows these and the other timeline controls.

The tools provided are as follows:
Go To Start  Moves the timeline slider to frame 0 and updates the graphics region to show 
frame 0.
Play Animation In Reverse  Does what the name implies. You move the slider to a point in 
time, you click the tool, and the animation plays in reverse.
Current Time Position  Specifi es the current time position. You may type into the fi eld to 
explicitly change to another time position. The graphics region updates content to show what 
the animation looks like at that time.
Play Animation  Does what the name implies; plays the animation forward from its current 
position.
Go To End  Puts the time slider at the end of the animation. The graphics region updates 
content to show what the animation looks like at that time.
Toggle Repeat  Turns on the repeat tool. When you play the animation, it will automatically 
repeat until you click Stop.
Record Animation (or Render Animation)  Activates the Render Animation tool and 
displays the dialog box.
You can edit selected actions with the dialog box by double-clicking the action in the track 
section, where the action bars appear, or by right-clicking and selecting Edit from the context 
menu.
You can edit action duration without going to the dialog box; just hover the mouse pointer 
over the start or end handle and then click and drag the handle to change the position. Hov-
ering over the center of the action and then clicking and dragging moves the entire action in the 
timeline.
Using Animation Favorites
Animation Favorites is a list that contains any animated constraint or parameter that you have 
nominated for animation. The purpose is to make it easy to fi nd those animation targets when 
you need to see or use them.
To populate the folder with a parameter, you must nominate the parameter. To do this, acti-
vate the Parameters Favorites tool. The Parameters Favorites dialog box, shown in Figure 16.19, 
displays, and you select the box in the row of any parameters that you plan to animate.
Figure 16.19
Th e Parameters 
Favorites dialog box
Selecting the box causes the parameter to populate the Favorites list. From there you can use 
the Animate Parameters tool however you’d like.

774 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Populating the Parameter Favorites List
For parameters to show up in the list, you might need to set them to be exported in the general 
model parameter settings. To do so, exit the Inventor Studio environment and click the Parameters 
button on the Assemble tab. Th en select the check box for the Export Parameter column for each 
parameter to be exported. When you return to the Inventor Studio environment, the exported 
parameters will be listed in the Parameter Favorites list.
Using Common Animation Controls
In each animation tool dialog box is a section titled Time. It contains all the controls to manage 
an animation action’s time allocation. You specify whether the action starts from the end of a 
previous action, starts in a specifi ed time range, or starts instantaneously.
Based on the time method, you are able to specify a start time and duration, a duration and 
end time, a start time and end time, or simply an end time (instantaneous only). The default 
method is From Previous, which starts the action at frame 0 if there is no previous action 
defi ned; otherwise, the new action begins at the end of the previous action. The other common 
tools are those on the Acceleration tab.
The Velocity Profi le setting defi nes how rapidly an action starts, proceeds, and ends. You can 
specify an action to occur at a constant speed. The default option specifi es that the action starts 
with zero velocity and then takes 20 percent of the action duration to achieve complete acceleration. 
The next 60 percent of the duration is at full acceleration. For the last 20 percent of the duration, the 
action decelerates until it reaches zero. The longer the action, the more observable this becomes.
Think in terms of an electric motor; when it powers up, acceleration is not immediate but 
occurs over a period of time, however long or short. When the power is turned off, the armature 
decelerates and eventually comes to a halt. This is essentially what occurs with the animation 
action based on the Velocity Profi le setting.
The values presented in the dialog boxes are in the document’s units. You can access the 
appropriate animation tool from the context menu of the item that is to be animated. For exam-
ple, you can right-click a constraint and select Animate Constraints to animate the selected con-
straint. The same is true of the other animation tools and their corresponding browser nodes.
Using Animate Component
You can fi nd the Animate Component tool on the Render tab. Animate Component is used for 
the unconstrained animation of parts or assemblies. Think of it as animating a component’s 
degree of freedom. Note that if a component does not move when you create an animation 
action for it using Animate Component, it likely has a confl icting constraint.
The Animate Component controls are as follows:
Select Components  By default, this option is active when the dialog is initiated; select the 
component, part, or assembly that will be animated.
Position  This option displays the 3D Move/Rotate triad to allow you to implicitly move or 
rotate the component as desired. On the triad, the arrowhead controls a move vector, and an 
axis controls a rotation axis.

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 775
Distance  This option is where you enter the distance value. Specify this value after select-
ing the vector on the Position triad.
Rotation  This option is explicit input in degrees for a rotation action. Select the axis to be 
used for rotation.
Revolution  This option is explicit input for the number of revolutions the animated compo-
nent will make. This is an alternate way to input rotation.
Path  This option has two settings, Sharp and Smooth. Sharp uses no smoothing between 
the start, duration, and end values. Smooth uses a continuous motion curve between the 
start, duration, and end values.
Using Animate Fade
You can fi nd the Animate Fade tool on the Render tab. The Animate Fade setting changes the 
opacity of a component over time. The parameters allow for this to happen over any defi ned 
period of time or instantly if you desire. You can animate to any level of opacity, from 0 to 
100 percent.
This tool is useful for fading components to reveal interior components while still giving a 
sense of the overall envelope, as shown in Figure 16.20.
Figure 16.20
A faded exterior
Animate Fade is not associated with a component’s visibility state; rather, it is a separate con-
trol for animating component opacity. This means you must create an instantaneous action in 
frame 0 for the component if you want to start out with less than 100 percent opacity.
For example, if you were to start an animation of a transmission with the housing at 10 percent 
opaque, you must create the action at frame 0 for the opaque value. Then, during the animation, 
you could create a different action to increase the Opacity value to make the housing 100 percent 
opaque.
The Animate Fade controls are as follows:
Select Components  Active (default) to allow selection of the objects to fade
Start  The component’s percent Opacity value at the start of the action
End  The component’s percent Opacity value at the end of the action

776 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Using Animate Constraints
You can fi nd the Animate Constraints tool on the Render tab. Assemblies are built using con-
straints that remove degrees of freedom and cause components to remain in place in relation to 
one another. They also work as engines to cause mechanistic movement. Thus, constraints make 
it easy to animate objects.
The Animate Constraints tool is used to modify a constraint over time. The component’s ori-
entation changes as constraints are modifi ed.
The constraint’s current value is the starting value. The value you give the end parameter 
determines the degree to which the object, and those constrained to it, responds.
When you’re animating with constraints, there will be times when something does or does 
not respond. This is most often caused by other constraints causing a confl ict with the animated 
constraint. One way to overcome this condition is to suppress the confl icting constraint, if that 
doesn’t cause a radical change in the animation or its purpose.
Using Animate Parameters
You can fi nd the Animate Parameters tool on the Render tab. If you have used parameters in 
your assembly and want to animate the parameters, this is the tool you will use. The parameter 
must fi rst be added to the Animation Favorites folder, as discussed earlier.
You can also use Animate Parameters with part parameters. As a result, you can morph the 
physical shape of a part given the right set of parameters and animation actions. For example, 
let’s say you are designing a vascular stent. As part of the product presentation, you want to 
show the degree to which the stent can expand and perform its function. How would you do 
this?
 
1. Create a stent diameter parameter in the part model.
 
2. In Inventor Studio, use the Parameter Favorites tool to nominate the parameter for anima-
tion use.
 
3. Set the timeline to 2 seconds.
 
4. Use Animate Parameters and change the stent diameter, thereby demonstrating the 
expansion the product undergoes.
If you’ve created user parameters on a part or assembly, you can access the parameters and 
animate them with these basic steps.
Using Animate Positional Representations
You can fi nd the Animate Positional Representations tool on the Render tab. Positional rep-
resentations (aka PosReps) use constraints to locate components while respecting the other 
constraints. You could conclude that they work almost like keyframes for an Inventor Studio 
animation. And, in fact, Inventor Studio treats them almost like that. Inventor Studio allows you 
to animate between positional representations.
All that is required is specifying the two PosReps and the time over which the transition 
is made. Inventor Studio does the rest. To animate a positional representation that is “deep”—
meaning it is deeper within the assembly hierarchy—you will need to set the subassemblies 
between the top level and the component owning the positional representation to Flexible. 

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 777
You do so by using the component’s context menu. The top-level PosRep must cause the 
“deep” PosRep to be activated.
You can also activate a “deep” PosRep by creating PosReps in each of the subsequent subas-
semblies. Each higher-level assembly has a PosRep that calls the child subassemblies’ PosRep. 
Repeat this for each subsequent subassembly.
Editing a PosRep animation action is like editing any other action, but there is a bonus. If you 
select the PosRep and expand the node in the Animation browser, you will see the participat-
ing members of the PosRep. Each of the members has an action bar, and you can edit the dura-
tion and position of the members interactively. The values must stay within the bounds of the 
defi ned PosRep. Initially, all members occupy the full span of the action, but you can change 
that by editing the PosRep. When you edit the PosRep, the members become enabled so you can 
adjust them. For an example of what this looks like, see Figure 16.21.
Figure 16.21

Using Animate Camera
You can fi nd the Animate Camera tool on the Render tab. When animating a camera, you use 
the current camera parameters as the “from” parameters of the animation action. Using the 
Animate Camera controls, you defi ne the “to” parameters for the animation action. With these 
controls, you can do the following:
 
◆
You can change the Camera Defi nition interactively or through a dialog box.
 
◆
You can use the view tools to position the camera and snapshot it as a keyframe using the 
Add Camera Action tool in the Animation Timeline window.
 
◆
You can use the turntable functionality.
 
◆
You can defi ne a path and have the camera and/or target follow the path.

778 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
In the Animate Camera dialog box, you select the camera to animate from the drop-down 
list. Then, using one of two methods, you defi ne the end position of the camera for that anima-
tion action.
The fi rst method is to use the Defi nition tool. To access its dialog box, just click the Defi nition 
button in the Camera section. The steps are similar to when you defi ne a camera using the dia-
log box, such as setting the target and position selection, as well as when you use additional 
animation options.
When you click the Defi nition button, the Camera dialog box displays, and you are able to 
specify the following:
Target Placement  Sets the line of sight the camera uses
Fixed  The target does not change positions.
Floating  The target maintains the positional relationship to the camera.
Path  The target follows a path made of 2D or 3D sketch geometry.
Camera Position  Sets the camera position relative to the target
Fixed  The camera does not change positions.
Floating  The camera maintains the positional relationship to the target.
Path  The camera follows a path made of 2D or 3D sketch geometry.
Roll Angle  Defi nes rotation around the camera to the target axis, displayed as a line 
between the camera components
Zoom  Defi nes a horizontal fi eld of view
The second method for defi ning camera animation is to use the current view. The steps to do 
this are as follows:
 
1. In the Timeline Active Camera list, select the camera you want to animate.
 
2. Position the timeline slider at the time position representing the end of the action you are 
defi ning.
 
3. In the Scene browser, right-click the camera you specifi ed in the list and click Animate 
Camera in the context menu. Alternatively, you can select the camera in the graphics 
region.
 
4. Use the view tools to orient the graphics region to the view you want to see at that time 
position.
 
5. Click Add Camera Action (the camera button) next to the Timeline Active Camera list. 
You will see the view briefl y revert to the last known position and then update to the cur-
rent position.
Repeat steps 2, 4, and 5 as needed for as many cameras as you want.

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 779
If you simply want a camera to travel around your part or assembly in a circle, the Turntable 
function makes this easy. To use the Turntable functionality, do the following:
 
1. Right-click the camera you want to use as a turntable camera and click Animate Camera. 
Alternatively, use the view tools to set the camera to its initial position, right-click, and 
click Create Camera From View.
 
2. In the Animate Camera dialog box, select the Turntable tab.
 
3. Select the Turntable check box to enable the turntable controls. A graphic preview of 
the current axis is displayed in the graphics region. In the Axis list, select from any of 
the canonical axes or the current camera horizontal (Camera-H) or vertical (Camera-V) 
handles.
 
4. Specify the direction of rotation around the selected axis.
 
5. Specify the number of revolutions.
 
6. Qualify the number of revolutions by selecting the literal (+/–), per minute, or per second 
option. For partial turntable effects, use a value less than one.
 
7. In the Time section, select whether to loop the camera or use a time period to defi ne the 
length of the action.
As mentioned earlier, when you select the camera defi nition method, you have the option to 
specify that the target or camera follows a path.
If you are planning on animating a camera along a path, you must defi ne the path geom-
etry in advance. You do this in a separate part fi le using 2D or 3D sketch objects. The part fi le 
is added to the assembly and positioned where you want it before ever entering the Inventor 
Studio environment. You can, of course, add the path fi le later and then animate the camera, 
associating it with the path.
Note that in order for the path part fi le to be hidden from the bill of materials, the part should 
be designated as a reference part.
When you select the Path option, move your mouse pointer into the graphic region and select 
the path you want to use. The tool searches for sketch geometry, so there are no confl icting 
inputs when you are in the graphics region.
After you select the path geometry, two handle glyphs appear on the path (Figure 16.22): a 
green triangle at the beginning of the path and a red square at the end of the path. The glyphs 
perform two functions:
 
◆
They tell you the direction the camera is traveling along the path.
 
◆
Also, the glyphs can be moved along the path, serving as a limit setting for how much of 
the path is used. To adjust a glyph position, place the mouse pointer over the glyph and 
click and drag along the path. Release the mouse button to accept the location.

Using Animate Light
You can fi nd the Animate Light tool on the Render tab. You can approach animating lights in a 
few ways. You can animate the lighting style, lights within a style, or local lights. For animating 
lights, the Animate Light dialog box has the same controls that were used to create or edit the 
lights. When defi ning an animation action for a light, you specify the light parameters as they 
will be at the end of the action. Inventor Studio tools use the previous parameter values as the 
starting point of the animation action and the new parameter values as the ending point of the 
animation action. You specify the time period over which the action occurs.
The fi rst steps for animating a light are the same regardless of the object to be animated:
 
1. Activate the Animate Light tool. Alternatively, select the object to be animated and use 
the context menu entry, Animate Light. The Animate Light dialog box displays.
 
2. If nothing was selected to start, specify the lighting style, style light, or local light to be 
animated. The Select tool is active by default.
 
3. Click the Defi nition button.
 
4. The corresponding dialog box appears, and only parameters capable of being animated 
are enabled.
 
5. If a style is selected for Lighting Style, you are able to animate the style brightness and 
ambience parameters.
 
6. For a local light or a light in a style, a variety of parameters are enabled for animating. 
Specify the values you want represented in the animation at the selected time position.
 
7. Click the OK button to commit to the values for the animation. An action is added to the 
timeline.
Local lights, when defi ned in components deeper in the assembly, are not accessible at the 
top-level assembly for animation. Local lights are meant to be light sources that travel with com-
ponents. Thus, if you defi ne a local light to be in a part used in the top-level assembly, that light 

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 781
will be lit and be a source of light in any renders or animations. The local light is part of the 
component, and wherever the component goes, the light goes also. Examples where local lights 
might be used are lighted gauges, switches, headlights, and so on.
Figure 16.23 shows a sequence of frames at time positions 2.3, 2.6, and 2.8. The local light has 
both intensity and position animated.
Figure 16.23
Animated local 
light
Time: 2.3
Time: 2.6
Time: 2.8
Lights within lighting styles can provide animated scene lighting. Examples of uses are gal-
lery lights, showroom lighting, and so on. Exploring the various ways to animate lights is worth 
the effort, not only for gaining experience but also for getting an idea of how much the light 
affects everything in the scene.
Dynamic Simulation to Studio
If you use Dynamic Simulation, part of the Autodesk® Inventor® Professional program, you will 
see the Publish To Studio tool in that environment’s tool panel, which allows you to render your 
simulation in Inventor Studio. The tool is used after you have run a simulation but before you 
leave run mode. You must run the simulation before using the tool.
The tool initiates the studio environment, creates a new animation called Dynamic_
Simulation, and adds a new parameter called Simulation_Timeline. The parameter is placed in 
the Animation Favorites folder and is ready to animate. The parameter represents the time 
steps used in the simulation. For this reason, it is recommended that you use the same number 
for the parameter value that is used for the images in the simulation. This way, you will be able 
to relate the animation to the simulation.
Animate the parameter, using the Animate Parameters tool, to see your simulation. Then use 
the other Inventor Studio tools, such as lighting and scene styles, to help enhance the animated 
result. When you’re ready, render the animation.
Using Video Producer
Video Producer provides the ability to compose a single animation from one or more anima-
tions. To access these tools, click the Video Producer button, located on the Animate panel. You 
are able to select from all cameras that you have set up, whether animated or not. Reasonably, 
to provide content for a production, you must create one or more cameras and usually at least 
one animation.
Video Producer supports the following:
 
◆
Multiple cameras in the same animation
 
◆
Camera transitions

782 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
 
◆
Multiple productions in the same assembly document
 
◆
Interactive modifi cation of camera shots and transitions
It is also possible to create a production of still shots using a variety of cameras. Video Pro-
ducer is presented in a window similar to the Animation Timeline window but with different 
controls. The playback controls are the same as those in the Animation Timeline window and 
most other playback or player software.
The composing timeline and tabbed browser on the left are where you will fi nd the shots and 
transitions. Shots are the cameras that have been defi ned in Inventor Studio, whether animated 
or not. Transitions are available to use between shots. Transitions are overlays over the shots, not 
segments between shots. Therefore, transitions extend into the shot in one or two directions. 
This means that when you plan to use transitions, you will need to specify enough shot time to 
allow for the transitions.
When you activate Video Producer, all cameras are collected, and all image representa-
tions are made and listed in the Shot browser. This action is session based. Thereafter, only the 
cameras that change will be updated when you return to Video Producer during that Inventor 
session.
Four transition types are available, but fi ve possibilities exist when you consider “no transi-
tion” as an option. The transitions are as follows:
Fade  From color to shot, shot to shot, shot to color
Gradient Wipe  From left to right
Slide Left  Moves from left to right
Slide Right  Moves from right to left
You can compose with Video Producer in two ways: via a dialog box or by dragging and 
dropping. Each has its own advantage.
Editing Shots and Transitions via Drag and Drop
I’ll fi rst discuss dragging and dropping, or the interactive means of creating and editing. This 
method’s advantage is fast production layout. Note that the composition is an additive process, 
starting from the beginning of the production.
Using the interactive method, you simply determine the camera shot you want to use and 
then drag and drop it onto the production track. You change the length of the shot by position-
ing the mouse pointer over either end, horizontally, and then clicking and dragging. Figure 
16.24 shows an example of each of these techniques.
Figure 16.24
Interactive edit 
handles

ANIMATING WITH INVENTOR STUDIO | 783
You can also drag and drop to reorder the shots in the timeline. Transitions behave in a simi-
lar manner. You simply drag and drop one onto the track and then adjust them as needed.
To make it easier to edit contiguous production timeline members, you can select one and 
then move your mouse pointer over the neighboring member that is to be edited. The selected 
member displays a cyan highlight, and the new select target gets a red highlight, as shown in 
Figure 16.25. When both are highlighted, click and drag the boundary between them; they edit 
and update simultaneously.
Figure 16.25

Selected member
New select target
Editing Shots and Transitions via Dialog Boxes
For more precise control over the time used and shot segment, double-click the shot and edit the 
parameters. Alternatively, use the Edit option in the context menu.
In the Shot dialog box there are two sections: Animation Footage and Shot Footage. 
Animation Footage refers to what the camera records in the animation. Shot Footage is the por-
tion of animation footage that is used in the active production.
In the production timeline, the shot footage displayed is the amount of time in the produc-
tion that footage is displayed. Any portion of the selected camera, from the designated anima-
tion footage, can be displayed during that shot duration.
For Transitions, double-clicking or using the context menu to select Edit will give you explicit 
control over the effects parameter values. In the Effects dialog box, you can edit the type of tran-
sition and its parameters.
Color is used for the secondary member of transitions that start or fi nish a production. Use 
the color selection to change the selection.
In the Shot dialog box, you can specify the following:
 
◆
The animation from which the footage came
 
◆
The point in time in the footage to begin using it
 
◆
The particular camera to get footage from
 
◆
The time frame of the camera footage to use
In the Effects dialog box, you can specify the following:
 
◆
The transition type
 
◆
The transition color
 
◆
The start, duration, and end timeline positions
These are the same parameters that are being edited when you do so interactively.

784 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Rendering Video or Animations
It is important to note that if a production is active when you use the Render Animation tool, the 
active production, and not the animation, will render. If you want to render a single animation 
and you have productions, be sure to deactivate the production before rendering.
The available animation formats are WMV and AVI, which will be discussed in more detail 
in a moment.
The Render Animation dialog box is used whether rendering an animation or production. 
With productions, you have already selected the cameras, so that fi eld is disabled. If you are ren-
dering an animation, the camera input is enabled.
The General and Style tabs of the Render Animation dialog box use the same controls as the 
Render Image dialog box. The Output tab, shown in Figure 16.26, has controls that specify the 
various parameters for rendering the animation.
Figure 16.26

Video Format
On the Output tab, you specify the name for the fi les that will be created. If you use a video 
format, you can choose from Windows Media Video (WMV) or Audio Video Interleave (AVI). 
Based on the fi le type selection and after the OK button has been clicked, you are asked to spec-
ify the fi nal parameters before rendering:
WMV Format  You are asked to specify Advanced Systems Format (ASF) Export properties, 
in particular, the network bandwidth. If you use one of the default choices and the output is 
not to your liking, use the custom setting; start with 700Kbps and increase from there.
AVI Format  You are asked to specify the video codec of choice. One or more codecs may 
have been delivered with the computer software. However, these, at times, may not produce 
the desired results.
Over the past few years, two video codecs have emerged as ones that routinely give good-
quality results with small to medium AVI fi le sizes. Although this is not an endorsement, it is 
good to know that the TechSmith (www.techsmith.com) and DivX (www.divx.com) codecs pro-
vide very good results.
In the Time Range section, specify whether the entire animation or a time range will be ren-
dered. If Time Range is selected, the timeline fi elds enable so you can specify the start and end 
times. If you want to reverse the rendered animation, select the Reverse check box.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 785
Note that the controls on the right side of the input fi elds give access to the most recent values 
specifi ed for the tool.
The Antialiasing settings are the same as those used in the Render Image dialog box. From 
left to right they are None, Low, High, and Highest.
The Format section is where you specify whether the animation is output in video format or 
as a list of frame sequences. If frame sequence is specifi ed, incremented numbers are appended 
to the name provided as images are created. If you plan on adding comments within the video 
or if you do not have enough disk space, you can output as images and then composite them 
later. This allows you to move the images to another location and continue rendering.
Then, specify the number of frames per second the video will output with. You will fi nd that 
24 and 30 frames per second (fps) are commonly used in broadcast and fi lm media. A 15 fps ani-
mation may look good to you. Try it at 24 or 30 fps; you will notice the improvement.
A major concern of anyone rendering is the amount of time it takes to generate an image or 
animation. Rendering an animation without some idea of what it will look like is a potentially 
expensive proposition at best. To enable better decision-making processes, you are able to cre-
ate a preview render; just select the box. Preview renders do not use lighting styles and render 
quickly. This gives you a means of determining whether any adjustments are needed before 
committing to rendering over a lengthy period of time.
These are the tools and concepts to accomplish rendering and animation in Inventor Studio. 
The creative part is up to you. Spend time experimenting, and you’ll fi nd you can create compel-
ling imagery.
Th e Bottom Line
Create and animate cameras.  Although static camera animations are a common part of any 
animation, by creating and animating cameras you give your renderings a much more pro-
fessional feel.
Master It  You know that the most expedient means of capturing camera keyframe posi-
tions is to create a camera and animate it. How do you do this?
Start new animations, modify animations, and use the various animation tools.  Animating 
your assemblies so that the function of the mechanism is showcased is often the purpose of an 
assembly animation.
Master It  You have an existing animation but want to do a variation on it. How do you 
copy and edit an existing animation?
Use multiple cameras to create a video production of your animation.  Video Producer 
provides the means to combine camera shots into a single video output.
Master It  You have created several cameras, animated and static, and want to make a 
composite animation. What are the general steps you will follow?
Use props to enhance your scene.  Inventor assemblies can be combined with other compo-
nents to create a more realistic scene for rendering.
Master It  You have completed a design and want to render a realistic image of it in its 
working environment. How do you do this?

786 | CHAPTER 16 INVENTOR STUDIO
Render shaded and illustrative images.  Inventor provides the means to render both 
shaded and illustrative images.
Master It  With your new product nearing completion, the marketing department has

Stress Analysis and Dynamic 
Simulation
This chapter will cover the tools of the Stress Analysis and Dynamic Simulation environments 
found in the Autodesk® Inventor® Professional software. The Stress Analysis environment 
allows you to perform static and modal analysis on parts and assemblies by defi ning component 
materials, loads, constraints, and contact conditions. A second type of stress analysis (referred 
to as frame analysis in this chapter) uses beam elements represented with a line segment that is 
centered in a Frame Generator member and interpolates the effects of loads on the geometry of 
the frame. This greatly improves the speed of the analysis.
The Dynamic Simulation environment allows you to analyze an assembly in motion by spec-
ifying loads, constraints, motion joints, velocities, acceleration, and environmental factors such 
as gravity and friction. These environments can be used together to determine motion loads 
enacted upon one component by another component at a given point in time.

Introduction to Analysis
Although the terms stress analysis and fi nite element analysis (FEA) are often used interchangeably 
in conversation, it may be helpful to understand them as they relate to the tools available to you 
in the Inventor Stress Analysis environment. FEA is an analysis of a complex object solved by 
dividing that object into a mesh of smaller elements upon which manageable calculations can be 
run. The stress analysis done by Inventor uses this method to allow you to analyze your design, 
under a given set of conditions specifi ed by you, in order to determine basic trends in regard to 
the specifi cs of your design.
Deriving an exact answer from the analysis of a model is generally reserved for an analyst 
with specifi c training, often for a more powerful set of analysis tools. With that said, you can use 
the Inventor simulation tools to run basic analyses to confi rm design validity. This can be useful 
to determine design basics before going down a wrong path. Or you can use these tools to help 
fi nd out, for example, whether a component or assembly is being over- or underdesigned for a 

788 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
given set of loads and/or vibrations. The stress analysis tools in Inventor are also useful when 
determining how feature size and locations will affect the integrity of the part. For instance, 
how close to the edge of a bracket can you move a hole? Is another brace required to prevent a 
sheet-metal face from “pillow casing” because of a pressure load? These tools are ideal for ques-
tions of this nature and can signifi cantly reduce the number of physical prototypes required to 
prove a fi nal design.
Dynamic Simulation allows you to set the components of your model in motion to verify 
how those parts interact with one another and to determine the force enacted on one compo-
nent (or group of components) by another component (or group of components). The Dynamic 
Simulation environment allows you to defi ne the way parts relate to one another and how the 
forces present create motion in the context of a timeline. From the simulation, you can deter-
mine how and when parts interact as well as the amount of force present for any point in time. 
For example, you might use these tools to simulate a force applied to a shaft used to turn a lever, 
which in turn contacts a catch stop, where the goal is to determine the maximum force present 
throughout the entire sequence. Once this maximum force is determined, it can be applied to 
the shaft as loads in a stress analysis study.
Autodesk Inventor Simulation Tutorials
If you have Inventor Professional installed, you can ﬁ nd a number of tutorials for the simulation 
tools by visiting http://wikihelp.autodesk.com. Once the tutorial ﬁ les are downloaded, you’ll 
need to point Inventor to the ﬁ les by setting the project search path to tutorial_ﬁ les. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 1. In Inventor, close any open ﬁ les.
 2. From the Get Started tab, click the Projects button.
 3. In the Projects dialog box, select tutorial_ﬁ les from the list.
 4. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Projects dialog box.
 5. Note the check mark next to tutorial_ﬁ les in the list, denoting that it is the active project, and 
then click Done to close the Projects dialog box.
Now you can return to the Wiki Tutorials site and follow along.
Conducting Stress Analysis Simulations
You can simulate a stress situation on your design to determine the effects of various load and 
constraint scenarios to determine areas of weakness, better design alternatives, how much a part 
is over- or underbuilt, to what extent a design change will impact a design, and so on. Using 
parametric studies, you can determine a combination of these elements to see how multiple 
changes impact a design at the same time. For more information on this topic, refer to the 
section “Conducting Parameter Studies” later in this chapter. This is an important task because 
understanding the basic tools and workfl ow is the fi rst step to setting up effective simulations.
The basic stress analysis workfl ow is as follows:
 
1. Enter the Stress Analysis environment (on the Environments tab, select Stress Analysis).
 
2. Create a simulation.

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 789
 
3. Specify the type of simulation you want to conduct (for instance, when working 
with assemblies, you may want to use an alternate view, positional, or level of detail 
representation).
 
4. Specify the materials for the components.
 
5. Specify the load types, locations, and amounts.
 
6. Specify the support types and locations.
 
7. For assemblies, gather and refi ne contact between components.
 
8. Generate a mesh.
 
9. Run the simulation.
 
10. Interpret the results.
To aid you in the process of learning how to conduct a stress analysis study, Autodesk has 
built in the Simulation Guide.
Simulation Guide
You can fi nd the Simulation Guide toward the right end of the Stress Analysis tab once you have 
started to construct a simulation. To access the Simulation Guide, click the Guide button, and 
the Simulation Guide panel will appear.
This tool was built with two types of users in mind: the novice who is looking for an under-
standing of the process of conducting a simulation, and the intermediate user who has been 
using an FEA tool in the past and is looking for additional advice on using the Inventor toolset 
or seeking to improve their knowledge.
The tool can be launched before you begin a simulation, or if you’ve already started setting 
up a simulation, it will open to the next appropriate step to offer guidance. To help in selecting 
load and constraint types, the guide contains a series of hyperlinks that will step you through 
various options on how the component or assembly is constructed and how it moves or is sup-
ported. It will even check with you to see whether there are features that may not infl uence the 
result of the analysis but may add unnecessary time to the process.
Static Stress vs. Modal Analysis
You can perform static and modal stress analysis on parts and assemblies in the Stress Analysis 
environment. To enter this environment, click the Stress Analysis button on the Environments 
tab. Once in the Stress Analysis environment, you use the Create Simulation button and specify 
either Static Analysis or Modal Analysis. It’s important to understand the difference between 
static and modal analysis:
Static Analysis  Attempts to determine the stress placed on a component by a particular 
set of loads and constraints. The stress is considered static because it does not vary due to 
time or temperature. You can import motion loads determined from the Dynamic Simulation 
environment to analyze the stress at any given time step for moving parts.
Modal Analysis  Attempts to determine the dynamic behavior of a model in terms of its 
modes of vibration. An example would be trying to determine whether the vibration gen-
erated by a running motor would create signifi cant disturbance to a sensitive mechanism 
within the design.

790 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Simplifying Your Model
When working with assemblies, you should exclude parts that are not affected by the simulation 
or do not add to its results in order to simplify the simulation and reduce the time required to 
run it. Excluding small parts such as fasteners, whose functionality is replicated by simulation 
constraints or forces, is also recommended. You can do this by expanding the assembly browser 
node, right-clicking the part to be excluded, and then selecting Exclude From Simulation.
When working with a part fi le in the simulation environment, you can suppress small 
features that are irrelevant to stress concentrations, such as outer fi llets and chamfers. These 
“fi nish” features typically only complicate the mesh needed for the simulation and add over-
head to the analysis. Other features that are typically excluded from simulations are small holes 
with diameters of less than 1/100th the length of the part, embossed or engraved text, and other 
aesthetic features. Excluding features of these types can have a signifi cant impact on the mesh-
ing process and the simulation’s run time. Figure 17.1 shows the exclusion of features from a 
part fi le on the left and the exclusion of parts from an assembly on the right. Using the appropri-
ate selection fi lter, you can select features and parts to exclude in the design window using typi-
cal right-click context menu behavior while in the assembly.
Figure 17.1

features for a 
simulation
Specifying Materials
To specify the material of each part in a simulation, use the Assign button on the Material panel 
of the Stress Analysis tab. Material properties must be fully defi ned in order for the material 
to be used for the simulation. Materials with incomplete information are marked with an icon. 
Figure 17.2 shows the Assign button used to access the Assign Materials dialog box as well as 
the icon indicating that incomplete materials have been specifi ed.
Figure 17.2
Assigning materials

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 791
You can specify the original material for each component or specify an override (per simu-
lation) from the Material Library. To change the original material of the part fi le while in the 
Stress Analysis environment, click the Inventor button, select iProperties, and then select the 
Physical tab. You can use the Styles Editor button in the Assign Materials dialog box to step into 
the Style And Standard Editor to edit, add, or just review the properties of any material style. 
You can fi nd the physical characteristics of a given material from a number of resources on the 
Internet, such as www.matweb.com.
It is assumed that materials are constant, meaning there is no change because of time or 
temperature to the structural properties of the material. All materials are assumed to be homog-
enous, with no change in properties throughout the volume of the part. And it is also assumed 
that stress is directly proportional to strain for all materials.
By default, the browser will display the names of components with overridden materials 
under the material name. You can also display all materials assigned to components by right-
clicking the Material category in the browser and then selecting All Materials from the 
context menu.
Applying Simulation Constraints
Constraints added in the simulation limit the movement or displacement of the model for the 
purposes of the simulation. To constrain a model for static simulations, you should remove all 
free translational and rotational movements. You should also strive to neither over- nor under-
constrain your model because both can impact the simulation results.
You can create all the constraint types by clicking the constraint tool buttons on the 
Constraints panel of the Stress Analysis tab, shown in Figure 17.3.
Figure 17.3
Th e simulation con-
straint tools
These are the types of simulation constraints available:
Fixed Constraints  These remove all translational degrees of freedom and can be applied to 
faces, edges, or vertices, typically to simulate a part that is bonded or welded to another com-
ponent. You can click the >> button to specify the Use Vector Components option and free 
the component in a given vector plane. Fixed constraints can also be used to specify a known 
displacement of a component to determine the force required to create the displacement.
Frictionless Constraints  Use these constraints to prevent the selected surface from deform-
ing or moving in a direction normal to it. You can also use frictionless constraints to simulate 
linear bearings and slides. Because most surface-to-surface situations are not entirely fric-
tionless, you can expect the simulation to return more moderate results. If friction is consid-
erable, it can be compensated for in the Dynamic Simulation environment, and the results 
can be imported into the Stress Analysis environment.
Pin Constraints  These are used to apply rotational constraints on a selected cylindrical 
face (or faces), such as where holes are or where parts are supported by pins or bearings. 
Use the >> button to set the direction options. A pin that rotates in a hole would have only 

792 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
the tangential direction free, one that slides in a hole but does not rotate would have only 
the axial direction free, one that slides and rotates would have both the axial and tangential 
directions free, and so on.
Figure 17.4 shows the simulation constraint dialog boxes.

Th e simulation con-
straint dialog boxes
Applying Loads
Loads are forces applied to a part or assembly resulting in stress, deformation, and displace-
ment in components. A key to applying loads is being able to predict or visualize how parts will 
respond to loads. For simple static simulations, this is generally fairly straightforward, but for 
more complex designs where one component exerts a force on another, which exerts a force on 
yet another, loads will likely need to be determined through the use of the Dynamic Simulation 
tools, as discussed later in this chapter.
You can access all the load types from the Loads panel of the Stress Analysis tab, as shown in 
Figure 17.5.
Figure 17.5
Th e load tools
These are the types of load available:
Force  This is specifi ed in newtons (N) or pounds-force (lbf or lbforce). Forces can be applied 
by selecting a single face, edge, or vertex (or a set of faces, edges, or vertices) for the loca-
tion. Selection sets must be of the same type, meaning that once you select a face, you can 
add faces to the selection set but not edges or vertices. The force direction can be specifi ed 
by selecting an edge or face and then changed using the Flip Direction button. Direction is 
automatically set to the normal of the face (with the force directed at that face) when a face 
is selected for either a location or a direction. You can avoid stress singularities by selecting 
faces or the location rather than edges or vertices.

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 793
Pressure  This is specifi ed in megapascals (MPa) or pounds per square inch (psi). Pressure 
can be applied only to a face or set of faces. Pressure is uniform and is applied in a direction 
normal to the surface at all locations. When applying loads to faces that are involved in con-
tacts, you should use pressure instead of force.
Bearing  These are specifi ed in newtons (N) or pounds-force (lbf or lbforce). Bearing loads 
are applied only to cylindrical faces. By default, the load is along the axis of the cylinder, and 
the direction is radial. You can specify the direction by selecting a face or edge. These are 
generally used to simulate a radial load such as a roller bearing.
Loads and Constraints
Loads and constraints can be applied to the same entity as long as they are compatible. When 
incompatible loads and constraints exist on the same entity, such as a face ﬁ xed in the X direction 
while a load is applied in the same direction to the same face, the constraints will override the forces.
Moment  These are specifi ed in units of torque such as newton meters (N m or N*m) or 
pounds-force inch (lbforce in or lbf*in). Moment locations can be applied to faces only. 
Direction can be defi ned by selecting faces, straight edges, axes, and two vertices.
Remote Force  These can be used as an alternative to applying a force load directly to a part 
by specifying the location in space from which the force originates. Apply Remote Force by 
selecting faces and specifying in N or lb.
Gravity  These are specifi ed in units of acceleration such as millimeter per second squared 
(mm/s2) or inch per second squared (in/s2). Apply gravity to a face or parallel to a selected 
edge. The default gravity value is set to 386.220 in/s2 or 9810.000 mm/s2.
Motion  Unlike with the other forces, there is no tool to apply motion loads in the Stress 
Analysis environment; instead, these are created from reaction forces determined from the 
Dynamic Simulation environment using the Export To FEA tool for a component per speci-
fi ed time step(s). Once they are created, you can use motion loads by one of the following 
methods: For a new simulation, click the Create Simulation button on the Stress Analysis tab. 
For an existing simulation, right-click the existing simulation in the browser node, and select 
Edit Simulation Properties.
In either case, once the Simulation Properties dialog box is open, you follow these steps:
 
1. In the Simulation Properties dialog box, select the Motion Loads Analysis check box.
 
2. Select the part from the enabled list.
 
3. Select the time step from the list.
 
4. Click the OK button.
Body  These are specifi ed in units of acceleration such as millimeter per second squared 
(mm/s2) or inch per second squared (in/s2). Body loads are the forces acting on the entire 
volume or mass of a component, such as gravity, linear acceleration, centripetal force, and 

794 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
centrifugal force. Select a planar face for linear acceleration or a cylindrical face for an axial 
direction. Use a body force to simulate the effect of outside forces. Only one body force per 
simulation is allowed.
Use the Linear tab to specify linear acceleration and the Angular tab to specify angular 
velocity or angular acceleration. The Angular tab has three possible results depending on 
what is specifi ed and how:
 
◆
Velocity and acceleration have the same rotation axis, with an unspecifi ed location. 
The solver determines the location along the axis.
 
◆
Velocity and acceleration have different rotation axes, with an unspecifi ed location. 
The solver determines the location along the axis. A point is selected along the veloc-
ity rotation axis for the acceleration location.
 
◆
Velocity and acceleration have different rotation axes, with a specifi ed location. The 
solver determines the location the same as when you defi ne the point with the vector 
components.
Using Split to Apply Loads Accurately
When you assign bearing loads to components, you may need to split the face ﬁ rst in order to 
select just a portion of a continuous face. For instance, consider applying a load to a shaft. If 
you select the cylindrical face, the load might be distributed along the entire face rather than 
concentrated on just the area intended to be loaded. You can use a work plane to split the face. 
Th is can be useful when placing loads on ﬂ at surfaces as well. Use a sketch to divide the surface 
into a face appropriate to the load. You can access the Split tool in the modeling environment 
from the Modify panel of the Model tab.
Specifying Contact Conditions
Contacts between components are detected when the simulation is run and automatically listed 
in the browser under the contact node. However, you can run the Automatic Contact tool to see 
them before running the simulation and then modify any of the automatic contacts listed or 
manually add other contacts. To add contacts, click either the Automatic or Manual button on 
the Contacts tab, shown in Figure 17.6.
Figure 17.6
Contact tools

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 795
For contacts to be added, the faces must meet the following criteria:
 
◆
The selected faces must be within 15 degrees of parallel. This 15-degree limit is a system 
setting and cannot be changed.
 
◆
The distance between the selected faces cannot exceed the Tolerance setting specifi ed in 
the simulation’s properties. You can access the simulation’s properties by right-clicking the 
simulation node in the browser for existing simulations, or you can specify them when you 
create the simulation.
Contacts are listed in the contact node in the browser and categorized per contact type. The 
type and components involved are set in the contact node name. Contacts are also listed under 
the browser node of each involved component. Modal analysis lists only the Bonded and Spring 
contact types, whereas all types are available for static analysis. You can change the contact type 
of automatic contacts by right-clicking a contact and choosing Edit Contact or by using the Ctrl 
or Shift key to multiselect contacts and then right-clicking and choosing Edit Contact. You can 
suppress contacts as well. Figure 17.7 shows the edit options.
Figure 17.7
Contact edit 
options
These are the available contact types:
Bonded  This creates a rigid bond between selected faces.
Separation  This partially or fully separates selected faces while sliding.
Sliding/No Separation  This creates a normal-to-face direction bond between selected faces 
while sliding under deformation.
Separation/No Sliding  This partially or fully separates selected faces without them sliding 
against one another.
Shrink Fit/Sliding  This creates conditions similar to Separation but with a negative 
distance between contact faces, resulting in overlapping parts at the start.
Shrink Fit/No Sliding  This creates conditions of Separation/No Sliding but with a nega-
tive distance between contact faces, resulting in overlapping parts at the start.
Spring  This creates equivalent springs between the two faces. You defi ne total Normal 
Stiffness and/or Tangential Stiffness. The Normal Stiffness and Tangential Stiffness options 
are available for the Spring contact only.

796 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
You can change the contacts between two components to see how the simulation results 
change. Figure 17.8 shows the same simple assembly simulation with a different contact applied 
between the two plates. On the left, a bonded contact is used, and the results show that the verti-
cal plate is deformed by the load and that stress is concentrated at, and distributed out from, the 
contact joint. On the right, a Sliding/No Separation joint is used, and the results show that the 
vertical plate is essentially pushed along the horizontal plate, with the stress being spread over 
the vertical plate and little or no concentration and no stress being distributed to the horizontal 
plate.
Figure 17.8
Contact comparison
Bonded
Sliding/No Separation
Preparing Th in Bodies
Your models sometimes contain components that have thin walls compared to the overall size 
of the model, such as sheet metal or plastic parts. As a result of this variation, standard analysis 
can cause long meshing times and instabilities in the computation. To deal with this, you can 
use the tools on the Prepare panel to simplify thin wall bodies to be seen as surface shells. 
When you use the Find Thin Bodies tool, the model is scanned and any bodies found to have 
a high Length/Thickness ratio are identifi ed as potential thin bodies, and you are given the 
option to generate mid-surfaces for the body. Alternatively, you can use the MidSurface tool to 
generate mid-surfaces for bodies you know to be considered thin bodies in advance. You can 
also use the Offset tool to create a shell from selected faces.
Once mid-surfaces or offset shells are created, you can convert them back to solids by select-
ing them in the browser, right-clicking, and choosing Delete. Keep in mind that loads and con-
straints applied to solid bodies before preparing them as thin bodies become sick when 
converted to shell elements and might need to be deleted. Figure 17.9 shows the Prepare tools on 
the left.
Figure 17.9
Prepare and Mesh 
tools

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 797
Generating a Mesh
Although you can accept the default mesh settings and run the simulation, often you will want 
to adjust the mesh settings to compensate for areas where a fi ner mesh is required. You can 
adjust the global mesh settings or use a local mesh control when needed. Figure 17.9 shows the 
Mesh tools on the right.
Mesh Settings
Use the Mesh Settings tool to change these mesh properties:
Average Element Size  Controls the mean distance between mesh nodes. Setting Average 
Size to a smaller value results in a fi ner mesh. This setting is relative to the overall size of the 
model. A value from 0.100 to 0.050 is generally recommended.
Minimum Element Size  Controls the minimum distance between mesh nodes as a fraction 
of the Average Size value. Increasing this will decrease the mesh element density. Decreasing 
this value will increase the mesh element density. This setting is sensitive, and changes typi-
cally result in dramatic changes to the mesh quality. A value from 0.100 to 0.200 is generally 
recommended.
Grading Factor  Controls the ratio of adjacent mesh edges where fi ne and coarse mesh areas 
come together. The smaller the factor used, the more uniform the mesh will be. A value of 1 
to 10 can be used, but a value from 1.5 to 3.0 is typically recommended.
Maximum Turn Angle  Controls the maximum angle for meshes applied to arcs. Specifying 
a smaller angle results in a fi ner mesh on curved areas. A value between 30 and 60 degrees is 
typically recommended.
Create Curved Mesh Elements  Controls the creation of meshes with curved edges and 
faces. If this is unselected, a less-accurate mesh is created, but performance may be better.
Use Part-Based Measure For Assembly Mesh  This sets part mesh sizes relative to the 
overall dimensions of the part models. Deselecting this option sets the mesh size relative to 
the overall assembly dimensions. Use this option for assemblies composed of several parts of 
varying sizes. This setting is available only in an assembly.
Once the mesh settings have been adjusted, you can click the Mesh View button to generate 
the mesh initially and then toggle on the visibility of the mesh afterward. It is not required that 
you generate the mesh manually, because it will be done during the simulation, but doing so 
may allow you to identify areas of importance on the model that are not meshed to your liking 
and then apply a local mesh.
Local Mesh Control
You can use the Local Mesh Control button to select faces and edges that require a fi ner mesh-
ing than what is required for the rest of the model. This allows you to manually improve the 
mesh quality for small or complex faces. A browser node is created in the Mesh node for each 
local mesh you create. You can right-click the local mesh and select Edit Local Mesh Control to 
change the mesh size or change the faces or edges selected.

798 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
When mesh settings or local mesh controls have been updated, a lightning bolt icon will dis-
play in the browser to indicate that the mesh is out-of-date. You can right-click the Mesh browser 
node and choose Update Mesh, as shown in Figure 17.10. This fi gure shows a simple cube with a 
local mesh applied to the top face; the other faces are meshed according to the mesh settings.
Figure 17.10
Updating a mesh
Understanding Mesh Settings
To understand the way these settings aﬀ ect the mesh generated, you can use the ﬁ le mi_17b_88
.ipt in the Chapter 17 directory of the Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and apply a mesh 
to it. Th is ﬁ le is a simple cube with rounded edges. Experiment with the options using the Mesh 
Settings tools. Th en apply a local mesh. Exit the Stress Analysis environment, edit the model, and 
change the value for Extrusion1 to 30 mm (all of the dimensions of the cube are set to be the same 
and will update to match).
Return to the Stress Analysis environment, and update the mesh. Note that the mesh adjusts as 
the cube size increases, whereas the local mesh holds an absolute size. Use the Mesh Settings tool 
to take a look at the other settings as well. Understanding the impact of each setting on a simple 
part model will allow you to determine the eﬀ ect of each setting on your more complex models.
Mesh Errors
When model errors prevent a mesh from being created, a mesh failure warning is displayed. 
Errors are reported in the Mesh progress dialog box, in the Mesh browser node, and with an 
error label and leader on the model in the graphics area.
An Interface Option Worth Noting
Th e previous sections discuss the selection of materials, application of loads, and generation of 
meshes. Th ese things are categorized in the browser.
An alternative to accessing the tools from the Stress Analysis tab is to right-click these categories 
in the browser and select the same tools from the context menu presented.

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 799
Running the Simulation
Once you have set the material, loads, constraints, and contacts, you are ready to run the 
simulation. To run a simulation, click the Simulate button on the Solve panel, or right-click the 
Simulation node in the browser and select Simulate. The Simulate dialog box displays informa-
tion about the simulation to be run and will display warning and stop errors when not all 
criteria are available to run. For instance, if you have forgotten to set a material type, the 
Simulate dialog box will stop you and tell you this. If you need to cancel a simulation in process, 
click the Cancel button or press the Esc key.
When a simulation becomes out-of-date because of changes to mesh settings, loads, con-
straints, or other design parameters, you will see a red lightning bolt next to the Results browser 
node. To update the simulation, simply right-click the browser node and click Simulate, or just 
click the Simulate button on the Solve panel again.
When working with parametric studies, it is possible to run simulations for more than one 
confi guration at a time. You can run an Exhaustive Set or Smart Set of confi gurations or just run 
the current confi guration. You can fi nd more information on simulating confi gurations in the 
section “Conducting Parameter Studies” later in this chapter.
External Linked Files Created by Simulation Results
Be aware that by default the Results ﬁ les are created and linked to your ﬁ le when you run a simu-
lation. Th ese externally linked ﬁ les can cause ﬁ le-resolution problems when you move or copy 
simulation ﬁ les or if you use Autodesk Vault. You can avoid the linked ﬁ les by clicking the Stress 
Analysis Settings button and then activating the Solver tab. Th en locate the Create OLE Link To 
Result Files option and uncheck the check box.
To remove links created when this check box was selected, you can go to the Tools tab and click the 
Links button on the Options panel. In the Document Links And Embeddings dialog box, select a 
link path and use the Break Link button to remove the link.
Interpreting the Results
Once a simulation is run, the Results node of the browser is populated, and the graphics area 
updates to show the shaded distribution of stresses. You can switch between available results 
types by double-clicking each type in the Results browser folder. Figure 17.11 shows a typical 
simulation result. Note the Results folder in the browser.
The Results node of the browser will display the subcategories of results, each displayed on 
the model by the use of color contours. The colors displayed on the model correspond to the 
value ranges shown in the color bar legend. Typically, areas of interest are displayed in warm 
colors such as red, orange, and yellow. These colors represent areas of high stress, high deforma-
tion, or a low safety factor. You can adjust the number of colors used in the color bar as well as 
the position and size of it by clicking the Color Bar button on the Display panel. Listed here are 
the result subcategories:
Von Mises Stress  Maximum stress theory states that failure will occur when the maximum 
principal stress in a component reaches the value of the maximum stress at the elastic limit. 

800 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
This theory works to predict failure for brittle materials. However, in elastic bodies subject to 
three-dimensional loads, complex stresses are developed, meaning that at any point within 
the body there are stresses acting in various directions. The Von Mises criterion calculates 
whether the combining stress at a given point will cause failure. This is represented in the 
Results node as the Von Mises Stress, also commonly known as equivalent stress.
1st Principal Stress  Principal stresses are calculated by converting the model coordinates 
so that no shear stresses exist. The 1st principal stress is the maximum principal stress and is 
the value of stress that is normal to the plane in which shear stress is zero. This allows you to 
interpret maximum tensile stress present because of the specifi ed load conditions.
3rd Principal Stress  The 3rd principal stress is the minimum principal stress, and it acts 
normal to the plane in which shear stress is zero. It helps you to interpret the maximum com-
pressive stress present in the part because of the specifi ed load conditions.
Displacement  The displacement results show you the deformed shape of your model in a 
scaled representation, based on the specifi ed load conditions. Use the displacement results to 
determine the location and extent to which a part will bend and how much force is needed 
for it to bend a given distance.
Safety Factor  The safety factor is calculated as the yield strength of the material divided 
by principal stress. This shows you the areas of the model that are likely to fail under the 
specifi ed load conditions. The calculated safety factor is shown on the color bar legend as the 
value followed by min. A safety factor of less than 1 indicates a permanent yield or failure.
Frequency Modes  Modal results appear under the Results node in the browser as fre-
quency modes only when a modal analysis is running. You can view the mode plots for the 
number of specifi ed natural frequencies. In an unconstrained simulation, the fi rst six modes 
will occur at 0 Hz, corresponding to the six standard rigid body movements.

Conducting Parameter Studies
Often the purpose of a stress analysis simulation is to determine how a change to a design fea-
ture will impact the part or assembly’s strength. The parametric study tools allow you to make 
comparative evaluations based on different parameter values at the feature, part, and assem-
bly levels. To create a parametric study, you nominate certain parameters for evaluation in the 
study, defi ne the range for each parameter, specify the design constraints that you are interested 
in seeing for those parameters, and, fi nally, analyze the results of each variation.
To create a parametric study, use these steps as a guideline:
 
1. Set the simulation’s design objective to Parametric Dimension. How you do this depends 
on whether you are creating a new simulation or editing an existing one. You can set the 
design objective to Parametric Dimension by using the Create Simulation button when 
creating a new simulation or by right-clicking an existing simulation in the browser and 
choosing Edit Simulation Properties, as shown in Figure 17.13.
Figure 17.13
Setting a simulation 
to the Parametric 
Dimension design 
objective
 
2. Nominate selected parameters for use in the study by expanding the browser node for 
the model and then right-clicking the assembly, part, or feature node you want to use in 
the study and selecting Show Parameters. Figure 17.14 shows a parameter called Side_
Offset being nominated.
Figure 17.14
Nominating a 
parameter
 
3. Defi ne the range for the selected parameters by following these steps:
 
A. Click the Parametric Table button on the Manage panel of the Stress Analysis tab.
 
B. Enter a parameter range in the Values column; values must be in ascending order.

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 803
 
C. Create a simple range by separating the minimum and maximum values with a 
hyphen; for instance, you can enter 70-85.
 
D. Specify specifi c values in a range by separating each value with a comma, colon, 
hyphen, or slash; for instance, you can enter 70, 75, 80, 85.
 
E. Add a colon to a range to specify the number of points included; for instance, you can 
enter 70-85: 4.
 
F. Use the slider to set the current value.
 
G. Right-click the parameter row and choose from the options to generate the geometry 
confi gurations. For instance, if you were to set the range of a hole position to 70, 75, 80, 
85, four model confi gurations would be created with the hole positioned at each of 
those values. Figure 17.15 shows a Parametric Table confi guration for the Side_Offset 
parameter.
Figure 17.15
Deﬁ ning a param-
eter range
 
4. Add design constraints to the Parametric Table by following these steps:
 
A. In the Design Constraints area of the Parametric Table, right-click a row and select Add 
Design Constraint.
 
B. In the Select Design Constraint dialog box, specify a results component, such as Von 
Mises Stress, Displacement, Safety Factor, and so on.
 
C. Specify the value of interest, such as Minimum or Maximum (this applies to all 
geometry).
 
D. You can modify the selection set by selecting Include or Exclude and then selecting 
bodies, faces, or edges on-screen. Doing so focuses the results to a specifi c area of inter-
est. Figure 17.16 shows the Safety Factor design constraint being added.

804 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION

Adding a design 
constraint
 
5. Specify the constraint type, set limits, enter a safety factor, and review the results using 
the following steps:
 
A. In the Parametric Table dialog box, click the Constraint Type drop-down, and select 
from the list.
 
B. Enter a value in the Limit column to fi lter the results to the set that meets the bounding 
limit when you’re optimizing other design constraints.
 
C. Enter a safety factor to specify at what extent a variable can be exceeded before causing 
the design constraint to fail. A comparison to the limit factored by the Safety Factor 
setting determines whether it meets the limit or range.
 
D. The Result Value column displays the value of the design constraint for the simulation. 
When the value is within the limit, it displays green. When the limit is exceeded, it 
displays red. When out of range, it displays gray, and the closest value is displayed. 
Figure 17.17 shows the Mass design constraint being confi gured.
Figure 17.17
Conﬁ guring a 
design constraint
 
6. When multiple parameters are added to the table, confi gurations can be created. These 
confi gurations can then be generated and simulated by following a few simple steps:

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 805
 
A. In the Parametric Table dialog box, set the parameter values to the combination 
you want to simulate, right-click any parameter row, and choose Simulate This 
Confi guration.
 
B. To simulate all confi gurations, exit the Parametric Table dialog box and click the 
Simulate button on the Solve panel. You can choose to run an exhaustive set, a smart 
set, or the current confi guration.
 
C. Once the simulations have been run, you can use the slider bar in the Parametric Table 
dialog box for each parameter to set the combinations and observe the results.
 
D. The Exhaustive Set Of Confi gurations setting runs all possible combinations of 
parameter settings, whereas the Smart Set Of Confi gurations setting runs only those 
combinations of parameter settings that Inventor determines have not yet been run. 
Figure 17.18 shows the choices for running simulation confi gurations.
Figure 17.18
Simulation 
conﬁ gurations
Once you determine that a given confi guration satisfi es your design needs using the 
Parametric Table dialog box, you can right-click any of the parameter rows in the table and 
choose Promote Confi guration To Model. This will write the parameter values of the confi gura-
tion to the source fi les.
Conducting a Frame Analysis
As you learned in Chapter 15, “Frame Generator,” having a library of predefi ned metal shapes 
can save a tremendous amount of work because you won’t have to re-create standardized 
geometry. Frame Analysis allows you to further leverage those predefi ned shapes by using the 
known behavior of the shape under load and calculating what the loads would be along the 
center of a length of material rather than the surface.
The process of conducting a frame analysis is similar to performing an assembly analysis, 
but frames add some additional tools that allow for an even more effi cient solving process. Here 
is the process, including some optional steps:
 
1. Enter the Frame Analysis environment through the Environments tab or by using the 
icon on the Design tab.
 
2. Create a simulation.
 
3. Specify the support types and locations.
 
4. Specify the load types, locations, and amounts.

806 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
 
5. Specify connections between beams, additional nodes, or releases (optional).
 
6. Run the simulation.
 
7. Interpret the results.
Frame Analysis Settings
You can adjust Frame Analysis settings by clicking the Frame Analysis Settings button on the 
Frame Analysis tab. On the General tab, you can adjust the colors, scales, and interface display. 
If you deselect the Use HUD In Application check box, you can use the traditional dialog box 
interface. By default, the Heads Up Display (HUD) interface is selected.
On the Beam Model tab, you can choose to automatically create rigid links, which allows 
you to adjust the model during automatic conversion. When the check box is cleared, rigid links 
are not created automatically during model conversion, but you can create rigid links manually 
later. You can also use the Trim Mitered Beam Ends option to trim overlapping ends during 
automatic model conversion, which simplifi es the model and improves the accuracy of the simu-
lation results.
The Solver and Diagrams tabs can be used to tweak the style of the simulation outputs and 
graphs ahead of time.
Frame Constraints
The concept of the constraint is the same for Frame Analysis, but the realities of how a frame 
is constructed can be different. Portions of the frame may be built with the ability to have one 
end move freely or slide along another member. This opens up the need to be able to approach 
things differently to assure accuracy.
You can access all the constraint types from the Constraints panel of the Frame Analysis tab, 
as shown in Figure 17.19.
Figure 17.19
Th e frame 
constraints
These are the types of constraints available:
Fixed Constraint  Like the Fixed constraint in FEA, it restricts all movement of the beam or 
node to which it is applied.
Pinned Constraint  Applying the Pinned constraint to a beam or node will allow rotation 
about the selected element, but it cannot move in space.
Floating Constraint  This constraint allows free rotation of the beam or node, but it also 
allows movement in one plane.
Custom Constraint  If you need a node or beam to be able to move or rotate within a 
boundary or with an amount of elasticity, the Custom constraint can establish those condi-
tions in any or all directions, including the ability for that movement to be unidirectional for 
one value and free in another direction.

CONDUCTING STRESS ANALYSIS SIMULATIONS | 807
Frame Loads
When the need to apply a mesh to a frame model is removed, it may become necessary to defi ne 
the loads in a different manner. This means that there are more options for loads in frame 
analysis.
The three primary loads are shown in the Loads panel of the Frame Analysis tab, as shown in 
Figure 17.20:
Figure 17.20
Th e frame loads
Force  This is specifi ed in newtons (N) or pounds-force (lbf or lbforce). The value of the force 
can be applied to a node along the length of a beam. Once an approximate position has been 
selected, a dialog will appear and prompt you for the position along the beam element. The 
icon that appears has a series of handles that allow you to change the angle of the plane in 
which the force is applied and the angle to the plane of the force; if you click the arrow that 
represents the direction of the force, the dialog will prompt you for the magnitude of force.
Continuous Load  This is specifi ed in newtons (N) or pounds-force (lbf or lbforce). This 
force applies evenly to the entire beam segment. The settings allow you to specify End 
Magnitude, Direction, Offset, and Length values.
Moment  This is specifi ed in units of torque such as newton meters (N m or N*m) or 
pounds-force per inch (lbforce in or lbf*in). A moment can be applied to a point at the end or 
along the beam segment with a graphical input similar to the on-screen feedback for apply-
ing a force.
There are also two types of load you can choose under Moment in a drop-down menu:
Axial Moment  This is specifi ed in units of torque such as newton meters (N m or N*m) or 
pounds-force per inch (lbforce in or lbf*in). This is a moment that can be applied along the 
axis of the selected beam. You can control the position of the moment along the axis, but it is 
automatically normal to the axis.
Bending Moment  This is specifi ed in units of torque such as newton meters (N m or N*m) 
or pounds-force per inch (lbforce in or lbf*in). A bending moment can be applied to a point at 
the end or along the beam segment. It is applied in the plane of the axis. You can change the 
angle about the axis to which it is applied.
Connections
Working with Frame Generator by its nature involves situations where additional information 
may need to be added to the model for a proper simulation: conditions where there are gaps or 
fl exibility in the model or you want to add additional nodes.
The tools for adding additional information are located in the Connections panel of the 
Frame Analysis tab, as shown in Figure 17.21:
Release  This connection can be applied to a beam adjacent to another loaded beam. 
You can control the fl exibility between the beams. The resistance to the movement can be 

808 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
controlled in the primary planes and around the axes using either a specifi c force or a partial 
stiffness coeffi cient.
Custom Node  You can add nodes along the beam to represent where contact will be made 
or to shortcut the loading process.
Rigid Link  If you have a machined or cast part built into your design, the Frame Analysis 
tool may not properly account for a rigid element between two points that appears to be free 
in the Frame Generator model. The Rigid Link tool allows you to select a parent node and 
have a child node maintain its position to it through the simulation.
Figure 17.21

constraints
Results
People doing Frame Analysis need to understand what is happening to the model along the 
length of a beam. In an FEA model, this is easy to visualize, and the coloration of the beam 
element also helps. Over time, methods for diagramming a beam have been developed, and to 
offer a familiar way to understand the results of the simulation, diagramming tools have been 
added to the Frame Analysis environment.
These tools are located in the Result panel of the Frame Analysis tab, as shown in 
Figure 17.22:
Beam Detail  This tool launches a dialog that allows you to see the basic results on the right 
and diagrams of the specifi c results for the selected beam on the left.
Animate  Results can be animated and recorded in order to observe the displacement or 
stress build up over a sequence of images.
Probe  Once a simulation is run, result values for specifi c points on the model can be visual-
ized using the Probe tool. The Probe Labels button controls the visibility of probe results.
Diagram  Selecting this tool opens a dialog where you can request various results to be 
displayed on the model.
Figure 17.22
Diagramming tools
Additional tools in the Display panel will place beam and node labels in the design window 
(rather than highlighting them in the browser) so you can more easily understand where these 
elements are.

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 809
For static stress analysis, the tools offered for parts, assemblies, and frames will offer you a 
great opportunity to better know the effects of changes to your designs.
Considering Every Load Scenario
An engineer was involved in a redesign of an equipment accessory that had unfortunately failed in 
the ﬁ eld. Th e problem originated from two sources. One was the use of an incorrect material that 
oﬀ ered too much ﬂ exibility under a particular load condition.
However, the second dynamic of this failure stemmed from the way the design was actually used in 
the ﬁ eld. During the design process, the considerations were mostly focused on how the mechanism 
would be operated during installation and how it would hold up under its highest load during use. 
Both were valid design considerations, but neither predicted the ultimate failure of the design.
As it turned out, it was the way these accessories were uninstalled that led to their high rate of 
failure. Not having anticipated this part of the way the product was used, the design team had no 
means to understand the unique torque loads that would ultimately make a good design fail. In the 
end, a slight modiﬁ cation to the design and the use of a diﬀ erent material type resolved the issue, 
but not before many dollars were wasted purchasing components that ultimately could not be used.
Keep this in mind as you create simulations, and remember that the results you generate can be 
only as good as the assumptions you make. Simulating every loading situation your design might 
encounter will expose these things before the ﬁ rst part is made or purchased.
Conducting Dynamic Simulations
Dynamic simulation is useful during the prototyping stages of design to test the function of 
interacting parts and for use in failure analysis where interacting parts enact stresses upon one 
another. When creating a dynamic simulation, you should follow the basic workfl ow listed here:
 
1. Defi ne joints to establish component relationships.
 
2. Defi ne environmental constraints such as gravity, forces, imposed motions, joint friction, 
and joint torque.
 
3. Run the simulation.
 
4. Analyze the output graph to determine maximum or minimum stress at a given time 
step, maximum or minimum velocities, and so on.
 
5. Export the results to the Stress Analysis environment for motion stress analysis 
simulation.
To access the Dynamic Simulation tools, fi rst open the assembly in which you want to create 
the simulation and then click the Dynamic Simulation button on the Environments tab.

810 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Working with Joints
In the Dynamic Simulation environment, joints are used to defi ne the way that components 
can move relative to one another. Although you might at fi rst associate joints with assembly 
relationships such as constraints, joints and constraints are actually two separate concepts. In 
the assembly environment, all components are assumed to have six degrees of free motion until 
grounded or constrained in such a way that some or all of these degrees of freedom (DOF) are 
removed. Standard joints approach the issue of DOF from the opposite end. In the Dynamic 
Simulation environment, all components are assumed to have zero DOF until joints are applied 
to add free motion. You can then add special joint types manually to restrict degrees of freedom.
Understanding the difference between assembly relationships and joints is important when 
working with joints. However, if you have a properly constrained model, much of the joint 
creation can be automated by setting the Simulation Settings option to Automatically Convert 
Constraints To Standard Joints. You can do this by clicking the Simulation Settings button on 
the Dynamic Simulation tab. Figure 17.23 shows the Automatically Convert Constraints To 
Standard Joints option.
Figure 17.23
Automatic con-
straint-to-joint 
conversion
When the Convert Constraints option is on, any assembly relationships that are changed 
will automatically update and be converted to a standard joint when possible. You can apply 
relationships while in the Dynamic Simulation environment by switching to the Assemble tab. 
When joints are built automatically from assembly relationships, you can retain them in the 
model when the translator is turned off. This allows you to customize the standard joints built 
from relationships and author new standard joints, without starting from scratch.
When the Convert Constraints option is off, you can use the Convert Constraints button to 
manually convert assembly relationships. To convert constraints manually, you must have the 
automatic Convert Constraints option turned off and the Convert Assembly Constraint button 
enabled. Using the Convert Assembly Constraint tool, you simply select the parts to which you 
want to apply a joint, and the Assembly constraints that exist between the two will appear in the 
dialog box. You can deselect one or more of the constraints to apply a less-restrictive joint solu-
tion. Figure 17.24 shows the different results achieved by selecting or deselecting the relation-
ships that exist on a shaft and handle.
Figure 17.24
Manual constraint-
to-joint conversion

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 811
In addition to the automatic joint creation, you can (and most often need to) apply joints to 
your model manually. You can access the joint tool by clicking the Insert Joint button. When you 
do so, the Insert Joint dialog box offers a drop-down with all the joint types listed. Alternatively, 
you can click the Display Joints Table button next to the drop-down to display the fi ve joint 
categories as buttons in the top of the table. Clicking a category button shows the available joint 
types for that category. Figure 17.25 shows the joint categories.

Force Joints
Standard Joints
Standard joints are created by converting assembly relationships to joints, either automatically 
or manually. Only one type of standard joint, called Spatial, is listed in the Display Joints table 
when the option to automatically create constraints is on. Here is a list of all the standard joints:
Revolution Joints  Used to create a rotational relationship between cylindrical faces and 
axes of two components.
Prismatic Joints  Used to constrain the edge of one component to the edge of another.
Cylindrical Joints  Used to constrain the axis of one cylindrical component to the axis of 
another, thereby allowing the second component to slide along the axis of the fi rst.
Spherical Joints  Used to create ball-and-socket joints between two components.
Planar Joints  Used to constrain the planar face of one component to the planar face of 
another. The fi rst component is the motionless component, and the second is allowed to move 
along the face of the fi rst.
Point-Line Joints  Used to constrain the center point of a sphere to the axis of a cylinder or a 
point on another component.
Line-Plane Joints  Used to constrain a planar face of one component to a point on another.
Point-Plane Joints  Used to constrain the point of one component to the planar face of 
another.
Spatial Joints  Used to create a relationship between two components where all six degrees 
of freedom are allowed without causing errors of redundancy in the simulation.
Welding Joints  Used to create a relationship between two components so there are no 
degrees of freedom between them and they are considered a single body in the simulation.

812 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Rolling Joints
Ten types of rolling joints are available. Rolling joints are used to restrict degrees of freedom. 
Here is a list of the rolling joint types:
Rolling Cylinder On Plane Joints  Used to constrain a rotating cylindrical face to a 2D 
planar face. The relative motion between the two selected components is required to be 2D. 
A basic, continuous cylindrical face is required for this joint type.
Rolling Cylinder On Cylinder Joints  Used to constrain one rotating cylindrical face to 
another rotating cylindrical face. The relative motion between the two selected components 
is required to be 2D. A basic, continuous, cylindrical face is required for this joint type.
Rolling Cylinder In Cylinder Joints  Used to constrain one rotating cylindrical face to the 
inside of another rotating cylindrical face. The relative motion between the two selected 
components is required to be 2D. A basic, continuous, cylindrical face is required for this 
joint type.
Gears and Rolling Joints
If you have created a gear using the design accelerator, you will ﬁ nd a basic surface cylinder present 
in the part model. To make the surface available for use in the creation of rolling joints, you can 
edit the part and set the surface to be visible.
Rolling Cylinder Curve Joints  Used to constrain a rotating cylindrical face to maintain 
contact with a curved face such as a cam. The relative motion between the two selected com-
ponents is required to be 2D.
Belt Joints  Used to constrain a belt component to two cylindrical components that rotate. 
Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.
Rolling Cone On Plane Joints  Used to constrain a rotating conical face to a 2D planar face. 
Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.
Rolling Cone On Cone Joints  Used to constrain a rotating conical face to another rotating 
conical face. Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.
Rolling Cone In Cone Joints  Used to constrain a rotating conical face to the inside face of a 
component that is not rotating. Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.
Screw Joints  Used to constrain components that screw together by specifying a thread 
pitch to defi ne the travel per rotation. Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.
Worm Gear Joints  Used to constrain a component to a helical gear by specifying a thread 
pitch to defi ne the travel per rotation. Faces, edges, and sketches can be selected.

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 813
Sliding Joints
The fi ve joint types in the sliding category are used to restrict degrees of freedom between the 
two components selected. In all fi ve, the relative motion between the two selected components is 
required to be 2D. Here are the fi ve types of sliding joints:
Sliding Cylinder On Plane Joints  Used to constrain a cylindrical face to a 2D planar face 
so that it will slide along the plane without rotating
Sliding Cylinder On Cylinder Joints  Used to constrain a cylindrical face to slide on 
another cylindrical face
Sliding Cylinder In Cylinder Joints  Used to constrain a cylindrical face to slide inside 
another cylindrical face
Sliding Cylinder Curve Joints  Used to constrain a cylindrical face to slide on a curved face 
such as a cam
Sliding Point Curve Joints  Used to constrain a point on the second component to slide 
along a curve defi ned by the selected face, edge, or sketch on the fi rst component
D Contact Joints
There is only one joint type in this category, and it is used to restrict degrees of freedom:
2D Contact Joints  Creates contact between curves on two selected components. Curves can 
be faces, edges, or sketches, but the relative motion between the selections must be planar. 
The contact is not required to be permanent for this joint type.
D Contact Joints
3D contact joints create an action or reaction force when applied. This category consists of just 
two joint types:
Spring/Damper/Jack Joints  These create joints for resisting forces, shock absorption, and 
lift jacking forces.
3D Contact Joints  These detect the contact and interference between all the surfaces of two 
selected parts. Subassemblies are not considered in this joint type.
More on Working with Joints
When components are assigned joints, either manually or automatically, they are grouped accord-
ing to the results of the joints in the browser. For instance, if components are fully constrained to 
one another in the assembly, they will be assigned a weld joint and listed in the browser as a welded 
group. If one of those components is grounded, the welded group will be listed in the Grounded 
folder in the browser. If one of them is used in a motion joint, it will be listed in the Mobile Groups 
folder. Figure 17.26 shows an assembly with two welded groups present. One is listed under 

814 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Grounded, and the other is listed under Mobile Groups. You’ll notice that both are used in the joint 
called Revolution:2.
Figure 17.26
Browser grouping
Here are some points to remember when creating joints:
 
◆
The Joint Table displays a pictorial representation for each joint type to assist you with 
determining which to use.
 
◆
Assembly relationships are not converted to joints in a one-to-one fashion; instead, joints 
are often created by combining assembly relationships. For instance, a Mate and two Flush 
constraints between two parts might be converted to a weld joint.
 
◆
Dynamic simulation performance is affected by the number of joints present. If you are 
simulating a particular set of components in a large assembly, it might be benefi cial to 
manually weld most of the components and consider motion only for the set you need.
 
◆
When placing a joint, you are often required to align the z-axis of the joint on both compo-
nents. Failing to do so will prompt a warning.
 
◆
If you have the option to automatically convert the assembly relationships selected, any 
assembly relationship you place in the Dynamic Simulation environment will automati-
cally be converted to a standard joint.
When placing joints, you should keep an eye on the coordinate triad and ensure that the 
arrows align when required. Figure 17.27 shows the use of the fl ip arrow to align the z-axis.
Figure 17.27
Aligning compo-
nent axes

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 815
To more easily review the joints that you’ve placed, you can select components in the browser 
or the design window and joints associated with them will be highlighted in the browser.
Working with Redundancy
In the Dynamic Simulation environment, joints are said to contain redundancy when they are 
overconstrained or have too many unknowns to solve. When redundancy occurs in a joint, 
Inventor prompts you to use the Repair Redundancy tool to repair the joint. In most cases, this 
tool suggests one or more solutions. Figure 17.28 shows a link assembly that has a redundancy 
in joint 4, the cylindrical joint. To resolve this, the Mechanism Status tool is selected.
Figure 17.28

Mechanism Status 
tool to resolve 
redundant joints

In the Mechanism Status And Redundancies dialog box, you can use the >> button to expand 
the options for resolving a redundancy. Typically, a new joint type is suggested for the redun-
dant joint. Often you can expand the drop-down and select from a list of possible alternatives, 
as shown in Figure 17.29. This dialog can also be shown while the simulation is running.
Also listed in the Mechanism Status and Redundancies dialog box are the redundant con-
straints. Tx, Ty, and Tz are the translational (linear) constraints, and Rx, Ry, and Rz are the 
rotational constraints. In Figure 17.29, the cylindrical joint shows that the Rotational X (Rx) and 
Rotational Y (Ry) are redundant.
Working with Environmental Constraints
Once joints are applied to the model, it is often necessary to apply environmental constraints 
to make the joints perform more realistically or to set the simulation up more effi ciently. For 
example, if you apply a prismatic joint between a rail and a linear bearing pad, a certain amount 
of friction would be anticipated, so you would modify the joint and apply a dry friction coeffi -
cient value. You might also want to create an imposed spring to emulate a spring cushion in the 
slide channel, or set the start position of the slide for the simulation. And then you might want 
to apply an imposed motion on the joint so that it moves during the simulation as expected. All 
of this can be done by right-clicking the joint and choosing Properties. When an environmental 
constraint for a particular joint is added, the constraint is marked with a green number sign next 
to it in the browser, as shown in Figure 17.30.

Modifying the Initial Position
Often you will want to change the initial position of a component involved in a joint so that the 
simulation will run differently from the way it is constrained. For instance, the rail and bearing 
pad example might be constrained so that the bearing is in the start position, but for the pur-
poses of reducing the time of the simulation, it needs to run only from the middle of the cycle 
to the end. Setting the initial position allows this. To adjust the initial position of a joint, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click the joint in the browser and select Properties.
 
2. Select the appropriate DOF tab. Depending on the joint, there may be multiple DOFs.
 
3. Click the Edit Initial Conditions button.
 
4. Enter a new position value in the input box.

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 817
Here are some additional options that may apply, depending on the simulation and results 
you are trying to achieve:
 
◆
Select Locked so that the joint cannot be modifi ed in the simulation.
 
◆
Deselect the Velocity check box to manually set the initial velocity of this degree of 
freedom or leave it selected to allow the software to automatically compute the initial 
velocity. I recommend you leave this set at Computed and impose a velocity using the 
Impose motion option (covered in the coming pages).
 
◆
Set the initial minimum or maximum bounds values for the degree of freedom, if desired. 
Value sets the boundary for the force or torque of this DOF, Stiffness sets the stiffness of 
this DOF, and Damping sets the damping boundary for this DOF.
Joint Torques
Joint torques can be set to control damping and friction and also to impose a spring cushion. 
Depending on the simulation, you can often apply these things to a few key joints and have 
other dependent joints react off them. Of course, this depends on the mechanism and the simu-
lation. To adjust a joint for these things, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the joint in the browser and select Properties.
 
2. Select the appropriate DOF tab (depending on the joint, there may be several).
 
3. Click the Edit Joint Torque button (the appearance of this button varies between rota-
tional and translational joints).
 
4. Select the Enable Joint Torque check box.
 
5. Right-click an input box and choose the input type required. Use Constant Value if the 
value does not change over time, or use the Input Grapher to enter a graduated input.
Figure 17.31 shows the Joint Torque properties for a prismatic joint.
Figure 17.31
Adding friction and 
damping to a joint

818 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
The range of inputs for Damping, Elastic Stiffness, and Friction are listed here:
 
◆
Damping is proportional to the velocity of the DOF.
 
◆
Free Position sets the position at which an imposed spring exerts no force.
 
◆
Elastic Stiffness sets the imposed spring stiffness.
 
◆
Friction is added as a coeffi cient between 0 and 2.
Imposed Motion
Although motion can be created by applying external forces where it is important, often an 
imposed motion on a joint is desired to allow control of the timing and position of components 
not involved in an external force. For instance, in the rail and bearing pad example, the bear-
ing might need to slide out of the way of another component that is being driven by an external 
force. Setting the imposed motion in the joint properties allows this to happen without the need 
to apply an external force on the bearing pad. To adjust a joint to include an imposed motion, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the joint in the browser and select Properties.
 
2. Select the appropriate DOF tab (depending on the joint, there may be multiples).
 
3. Click the Edit Imposed Motion button.
 
4. Select the Enable Imposed Motion check box.
 
5. Select a Driving motion parameter type and enter a value. The parameter types are as 
follows:
Position  Imposes a motion to a specifi ed position, typically specifi ed using the Input 
Grapher to set the position relative to a time step (for example, move 100 cm over 10 
seconds).
Velocity  Imposes a motion at a specifi ed velocity. Use constant input or use the Input 
Grapher to enter a variable velocity to account for startup times and so on.
Acceleration  Imposes a motion as a specifi ed acceleration. Use constant input or use the 
Input Grapher to enter a variable acceleration.
Using the Input Grapher
The Input Grapher is available in a number of input boxes used throughout the Dynamic 
Simulation environment. When an input is set to use the Input Grapher, a Graph button is 
present in the input box. If no Graph button is present, you can right-click in the input box 
and select Input Grapher from the context menu. To open the Input Grapher, simply click the 
Graph button.
Typically, the Input Grapher is used to specify a value that varies over time. In Figure 17.32, 
a velocity is being imposed on a joint starting at 0 in/s and coming up to 100 in/s in the fi rst 10 
seconds, at which time it levels off for the next 10 seconds before returning to 0 in/s at 30 sec-
onds. The user has right-clicked in the graph to add a control point.

CONDUCTING DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS | 819

Adding a veloc-
ity curve with the 
Input Grapher
Each portion of the graph between points is selectable as a sector by clicking the graph. In 
Figure 17.32, the fi rst sector is selected and is shaded. When a sector is selected, the inputs in the 
bottom half of the Input Grapher dialog box are specifi c to that sector. You can edit the sector’s 
start point and endpoint as well as the law applied to that specifi c sector.
You can modify the input graph by changing the x-axis variable, the laws applied, the freeing 
sector condition, and more. The following sections briefl y describe these graph input variables.
Input References
By default, Time is the x-axis variable for the curve graph in the Input Grapher. In many inputs, 
you can specify a different x-axis reference. Clicking the Reference button displays all variables 
available to be used as x-axis variables in the curve graph. Imposed motions cannot use x-axis 
references other than Time. Figure 17.33 shows a curve graph being set to call Velocity as the 
x-axis of the curve.

Laws
To defi ne each sector of a curve, you can assign mathematical functions, or laws. These laws can 
be applied individually or in combination as needed to fully defi ne the sector curve. To assign a 
sector a specifi c law, select the law from the list in the drop-down, and then use the arrow but-
ton to apply the law. Use the plus button to add laws to the sector, and use the minus button to 
remove laws from the sector. Here is a list of the available laws:

Freeing and Application Conditions
Each sector can be set to Active, Free, or Condition. Active indicates that the sector has no condi-
tions. Free indicates that the sector has no values defi ned. Condition indicates that one or more 
conditions have been assigned to the sector.
To create a condition, click the Condition radio button. By default, the Freeing Conditions 
dialog box appears. To edit or add a condition, click the Defi ne Conditions button and then click 
the Variable, Equal, or Value links to set those options. Use the plus and minus signs to add or 
remove conditions. Figure 17.34 shows a condition being added.

More Functions
The Input Grapher has a few functions that might not be apparent but are useful to know about 
when you’re setting up and using it:
 
◆
The bottom display is dependent on what is selected in the graph. Selecting a point gives 
inputs for just that point, selecting a sector gives sector options, and clicking in the graph 
outside all sectors gives Out Of Defi nition options that are used to describe the part of the 
curve on the left or right of the fi rst and last points.
 
◆
Using the wheel button on your mouse, you can pan and zoom in the graph. This can be 
helpful when dealing with sectors that are dramatically different in scale. You can also use 
the Zoom button in the Input Grapher dialog box.
 
◆
Curve defi nitions can be saved and loaded using the Save Curve and Load Curve buttons.
External Forces
To set a component in motion, you can apply an imposed motion on the joint or apply an exter-
nal force on the component itself. External forces consist of loads and gravity. External forces 
can be used to initiate, complement, or resist movement. For instance, in the rail and bearing 
pad example, if the bearing traveled past a catch stop mechanism designed to prevent back 
travel, you might apply an external force on the bearing pad at that position to ensure that it 
can overcome a maximum resistance. External forces are often used just to set the simulation in 
motion as well. Loads and gravity are further defi ned here.
Loads
You can apply as many force and torque loads as required and manage them from the External 
Loads browser node, where all force and torque loads are listed once created. To apply external 
load forces, click the Force or Torque button on the Load panel, and set the location, direction, 
magnitude, and so on, as described here:
Location  For the Location setting, a vertex must be selected. You can select a vertex, circu-
lar edge, sketch point, work point, and so on.
Direction  For the Direction setting, select an edge or face, and then use the Flip button to 
change it if needed.
Magnitude  Enter the Magnitude setting as a constant, or select Input Grapher.
Fixed and Associative Load Buttons  Use the Fixed and Associative load buttons to desig-
nate the load direction method. Fixed sets the load to be constant to the direction in which 
it is defi ned. Associative sets the direction to follow the component as it moves during the 
simulation. For instance, if an Associative direction is established using the edge of a hinge, 
the direction will stay aligned to that edge as the hinge swings.
The >> Button  Use the >> button to set the vector components as required.
Display Check Box  Set the Display check box to see the Force or Torque arrow and then set 
the scale and color of the arrow.

822 | CHAPTER 17 STRESS ANALYSIS AND DYNAMIC SIMULATION
Gravity
You can defi ne the gravity for the entire simulation by expanding the External Load node in 
the browser, right-clicking the Gravity button, and choosing Defi ne Gravity. A default value 
of 386.220 in/s2 or 9810.000 mm/s2 is supplied, but you can edit this to any value required. To 
defi ne gravity, you simply select an object face or edge and then use the Flip button to set the 
direction. You should choose static components to defi ne gravity.
Running a Simulation
Once the model is defi ned with joints, loads, and environmental constraints, you are ready 
to run the simulation. Running the simulation involves two primary controls: the Simulation 
Player and the Output Grapher. The tools are generally used together.
Simulation Player
You use the Simulation Player to run and stop the simulation. The Simulation Player is dis-
played by default but can be toggled on and off using the Simulation Player button on the 
Manage panel of the Dynamic Simulation tab. Figure 17.35 shows the Simulation Player options, 
and Table 17.1 provides a description of each.

for large or complex simulations.

Player Controls
Th ese include the standard play, stop, rewind to the beginning, fast-
forward to the end, and continuous loop controls as well as a 
Deactivate Screen Refresh During Simulation control. Deactivating 
the screen refresh speeds up the simulation.
The Output Grapher
You can access the Output Grapher during or after running a simulation to view and use the 
data collected during the simulation. Data can be exported to Microsoft Excel or marked for use 
in the Stress Analysis environment. You can also export the results as an IAA (*.iaa) fi le and 
import the fi le into another simulation for comparison of the graph results.
Once the curve type is selected, you can examine the time steps to see the value for each step. 
Figure 17.36 shows an acceleration curve displayed in the Output Grapher. The time step for six 
seconds is selected (1) and is marked in the graph area with a vertical line (2). You can click in 
the graph area to select a time stamp or select it from the top pane. You can also use the arrow 
keys on the keyboard to advance through each step.

You can use the Save Simulation button to save a simulation result before making changes 
and then use the Import Simulation button to bring it back in once the modifi ed simulation has 
been run. This allows both simulation curves to be overlaid for comparison. Figure 17.37 shows 
the location of the Save and Import Simulation buttons in the Output Grapher dialog box. In 
this illustration, the original acceleration curve has been imported and overlaid onto a modifi ed 
simulation. You can see that the changes made just after six seconds have slowed the extended 
lag time and have reduced the end acceleration from 8 in/s in the original to just over 6 in/s in 
the modifi ed version. Both simulations are marked in the browser.
Figure 17.37
An imported accel-
eration curve
Also shown in Figure 17.37, the context menu is obtained by right-clicking either of the curve 
columns. From this menu you can search for the minimum and maximum values as well as zero 
values. You can also select Curve Properties and change the curve colors as well as analyze the 
average, minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation, and amplitude of the curve.
Exporting to FEA
You can use the Output Grapher to identify maximum forces and then export those forces for 
use in the Stress Analysis environment. Although the maximum stress is likely the most com-
mon value to be exported, you can export the force for any time step in the simulation. This can 
be useful when trying to focus on a particular event in the simulation. Here are the steps for 
exporting a maximum force:
 
1. Select that force in the left pane of the Output Grapher.
 
2. Right-click and choose Search Max.
 
3. Select the check box for the time step identifi ed as the maximum value.
 
4. Click the Export To FEA button in the Output Grapher or on the Dynamic Simulation tab.

should also note that you can export multiple time steps at once by selecting them all before 
clicking the Export To FEA button.

Th e Bottom Line
Set up and run Stress Analysis simulations.  Oftentimes you may fi nd yourself guessing at 
what impact a change to your design might have on the strength and overall integrity of your 
part. Questions such as “Can I make this part a bit lighter?” or “Can I move this cutout closer 
to the edge?” become important to the success of your design.
Master It  Set up a parameter study in your model to explore the consequences of edit-
ing features and their locations. Nominate all the crucial parameters to the table and then 
create the confi guration simulations for all of the combinations.
Set up and run Dynamic Simulations.  When you fi nd yourself working out the details of 
a design with many moving parts, consider using the Dynamic Simulation tools early in the 
process to prove what will or will not work before going forward.
Master It  Even before the assembly is complete, switch to the Dynamic Simulation 
environment and create assembly relationships in the simulation. Test the motion as you 
build the parts, and attempt to understand how contact will occur from the beginning.
Export results from the Dynamic Simulation environment to the Stress Analysis environ-
ment.  Often when setting up a stress analysis simulation, you are guessing at what the 
loads might be, based on rough calculations. As you make changes to the design, those calcu-
lations become out-of-date and therefore invalid.
Master It   How do you use the Dynamic Simulation tools to determine the force exerted 
on one part by another? 

Chapter 18
Routed Systems
This chapter will cover the tools of the routed systems environments found in the Autodesk® 
Inventor® Professional suite and the Inventor Routed Systems Suite. Inventor routed systems 
comprise two primary toolsets: tube and pipe, and cable and harness. The tube and pipe tools 
are used in routing pipe and hosing through mechanical assembly designs. The cable and 
 harness tools are used for electrical design where routing wires and cables around obstacles 
and checking for fi t are important.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

◆

Tube and Pipe
The tube and pipe tools are based on Inventor fundamental concepts such as sweeps, 3D sketch 
paths, adaptive parts, subassembly structure, and more. The tube and pipe tools automate many 
of these fundamentals, making the design of tube and pipe routes faster, more intuitive, and 
less tedious. However, it is best to have an understanding of these fundamental concepts before 
jumping into the tube and pipe tools so you can understand how Inventor does things and, 
therefore, how to proceed when required to manually adjust or repair your designs. A lack of 
understanding of these fundamentals can often bring inexperienced Inventor users to a screech-
ing halt in their tube and pipe endeavors and may leave them with a perception that the tools 
just don’t work. Therefore, in the following sections, you will explore how to create routes, runs, 
and general tube and pipe assembly structure and learn to work with tube and pipe styles.
Understanding Routes, Runs, and Assembly Structure
Understanding the way that tube and pipe assembly structure is created is an important part of 
successfully creating and managing your tube and pipe designs. There are three primary levels 
to any tube and pipe assembly.

828 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
◆
A top-level assembly
 
◆
A tube and pipe run assembly
 
◆
A run assembly
All tube and pipe designs are made up of runs. A run is a subassembly that contains one or 
more route paths, pipe or hose segments, and fi ttings. For instance, a standard hot-water supply 
line is a run.
When you begin a tube and pipe design, you start with a new assembly template and click 
the Tube And Pipe button on the Environments tab. Doing so opens the Create Tube & Pipe 
Run dialog box, prompting you to set a name and location for the tube and pipe run assembly 
fi le and the fi rst run assembly fi le. Figure 18.1 shows the Create Tube & Pipe Run dialog box for 
a top-level assembly, named mi_18a_100, being created. You can also add a new tube and pipe 
assembly to an existing assembly.
Figure 18.1
Th e Create Tube 
& Pipe Run 
dialog box
Notice that the default paths are created based on where the top-level assembly is stored. In 
this case, mi_18a_100.iam is stored in a subfolder of the Chapter 18 folder called mi_18a_100. 
The tube and pipe runs assembly is simply a container assembly created to contain the mul-
tiple runs you might create in the design. It is prefi xed with the top-level assembly name and 
defaulted to a folder under it named the same as the top-level assembly and then AIP\Tube 
and Pipe.
The run assembly is prefi xed with the top-level assembly name, given an incremental suf-
fi x (in this case 01), and defaulted to a subfolder named Run plus the increment number located 
in the same directory as the assembly. Although you can change this fi le structure per tube 
and pipe assembly, accepting the default does maintain a certain standardization of structure. 
Figure 18.2 shows the assembly browser structure and fi le structure of a tube and pipe design 
set to the default paths.
Once a run is created, you can create a route within it. Routes are 3D paths created to defi ne 
the path for pipes, tubes, or hoses to follow. In Figure 18.2, there are two elbow fi ttings (DIN 
2605 90 Deg Elbow) that were placed outside the run and in the tube and pipe runs assembly. 
Route01 was then created as a component of Run01, starting from one of the DIN elbows and 
running to the other. Run01 consists of Route01, three pipe segments, and two 90-degree elbows.

TUBE AND PIPE | 829
Figure 18.2

structure of tube 
and pipe design
Assembly Structure
File Structure
Although the pipe segments and the route path fi les were saved under the Run01 folder, 
you’ll notice that the elbow fi les were saved to the Content Center Files path. Because 
 fi ttings such as elbows, tees, and couplings are generated from Content Center, these part fi les 
are  automatically saved to the Content Center Files path defi ned in either your project fi le or 
your Application Options settings.
Here are a few things to note when working with tube and pipe runs:
 
◆
A unique part fi le is created for each pipe, tube, and hose segment in the run, even if more 
than one segment is the same length. Although this approach may seem a departure from 
what you’d expect, it is key to allowing runs to be edited downstream.
 
◆
Enter meaningful names for the runs and routes as you create them. As you create more 
complex designs, having multiple Route01s scattered throughout the assembly may create 
confusion during edits.
Exploring the Tube and Pipe Styles
Runs and routes are determined by tube and pipe styles. Properties such as material, diameter, 
and fi tting types are set in the tube and pipe style. Rules such as minimum and maximum 
segment length can also be set in the style. The Inventor tube and pipe tools load with several 
default styles based on the ANSI, DIN, ISO, and JIS tube and pipe standards and the Parker hose 
and fi ttings. Styles fall into three primary categories:
Flexible Hose  These are single hose segments connected by a start point and endpoint 
selection. The hose style can include, but is not required to have, fi ttings for the start and stop 
points.
Tubing with Bends  This does not contain elbows and follows a default bend radius. The 
radius can be set per bend as needed. Minimum and maximum segment lengths are set in 
the style, and couplings are placed where segments connect.

830 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Rigid Pipe with Fittings  These styles are required to include 90-degree elbow fi ttings and 
can include 45-degree elbows, fl anges, and couplings. There are three subcategories for rigid 
piping styles:
Self Draining  These styles require a pipe, a coupling, a 45-degree elbow, a 90-degree 
elbow, and a custom elbow or tee to match the desired slope angle.
Butt Welded  These styles require a pipe and a 90-degree elbow. Butt welded styles re-
quire a weld gap size.
Flanged  These styles require a pipe, an elbow, a fl ange, and optionally a gasket.
Mixed Units  If a fl anged style is selected for rigid pipe, the Mixed Units option is en-
abled as a style choice for the end treatment. This option indicates that the style contains 
fl anged fi ttings that use imperial units and metric units. 
Figure 18.3 shows a fl exible hose run, a rigid tubing run, and a rigid piping run, from top to 
bottom.
Figure 18.3
Hose, tube, and 
pipe runs
The Tube & Pipe Styles Dialog Box
You can access the Tube & Pipe Styles dialog box by using the master tube and pipe runs assem-
bly, by using the run assembly, or by clicking the Tube And Pipe Styles button on the ribbon 
or using the default right-click context menu. The dialog box is divided into a pane on the left 
listing the styles and two tabs on the right controlling the general settings and the style rules. 
Figure 18.4 shows the Tube & Pipe Styles dialog box with a Hydraulic Hose style set active, 
denoted in bold. A second style is selected and has been right-clicked, showing the options that 
correspond with the buttons along the top of the dialog box.

TUBE AND PIPE | 831
Figure 18.4
Th e Tube & Pipe 
Styles dialog box
When you’re editing, copying, or creating a new style, some components may be either 
required or optional, depending on the style type. If the component is not specifi ed and it is 
required, it will be marked with a red arrow next to it on the General tab. If it is empty and 
shows a gray arrow, it is optional. When the component is selected, the arrow will be green. 
Figure 18.5 shows a pipe style being created from scratch.
Figure 18.5
Creating pipe 
styles
This new style is a Butt Welded style and requires a pipe and a 90-degree elbow. The pipe has 
been selected, but the elbow is still required, as indicated by the red (dark) arrow. The 45-degree 
elbow is not required, and its optional status is indicated by the gray (light) arrow. In Figure 18.5 

832 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
the user has right-clicked in the Elbow 90 row and selected Browse in order to specify the 
required elbow type. You can also double-click a row to open the style library browser.
In the style library browser, you can select from the list of available styles based on the size, 
schedule, and material settings made in the General tab and the availability from the Content 
Center library. You can set additional fi ltering in the style library browser. When you set the 
fi lter to a particular standard, the materials available for that particular standard are listed. If an 
asterisk is displayed, all the content for that setting is displayed.
Back in the Tube & Pipe Styles dialog box, you can specify a minimum and maximum size 
range for creating route segments on the Rules tab. I recommend you set the minimum segment 
length to at least 1.5 times the nominal diameter value to avoid minimum segment length viola-
tions that occur when pipe segments are too small in relation to the nominal diameter.
Each style type has different rule criteria:
 
◆
For Rigid tubes, you can set the default bend radius for the bends.
 
◆
For Flexible hoses, you can set a minimum bend radius and hose length round-up value.
 
◆
For Butt Welded pipe styles, you can set the gap size for the groove welds and control the 
display of the gaps in the graphics display and in drawings.
 
◆
For Butt Welded Flanged pipes, you can specify the coupling style.
 
◆
Fitting connections are determined by the end treatment set for the particular fi tting.
 
◆
All other end treatments use a gap at segments and fi tting joints.
Generally, it is best practice to set the style before creating routes and placing fi ttings. However, 
you can create and apply styles at any time. Styles can be set in a number of ways. You can change 
the active style for the tube and pipe assembly so that all new runs follow the style; you do this by 
selecting a style from the Style drop-down. Or you can change the style for the active route by set-
ting that route as active and using the Style drop-down to select a different style. You cannot change 
a rigid pipe route to a fl exible hose style or vice versa. To make such a change, you must delete the 
route and re-create it.
Authoring Tube and Pipe Components
Tube and pipe components, like components for other applications, require authoring before 
they can be published into Content Center. The tube and pipe authoring process is more com-
plex because the router uses the component geometry. For example, the router needs to know 
the difference between a tee and an elbow, and it needs to know how much the connector over-
laps the pipe.

example to author a PVC pipe to an NPT adaptor:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button and browse to the Chapter 18 directory in 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_18a_010.ipt.

TUBE AND PIPE | 833
 
3. Switch to the Manage tab, and select the Tube And Pipe Authoring button from the drop-
down list on the Author panel (it might be displaying Component by default). The Tube & 
Pipe Authoring dialog box displays, and the part changes to shaded wireframe display.
 
4. Select Adapters from the Type drop-down, as shown in Figure 18.6.
Figure 18.6
Setting the 
ﬁ tting type
 
5. Change the number of connections, and observe that the connection buttons update to 
match. Confi rm that Connections is set to 2.
 
6. Confi rm that the End Treatment is set to Threaded and enter 1/2 in for the Nominal Size 
setting.
 
7. By default, the button for connection 1 is active. Select one of the circular edges to defi ne 
the connection point. Click the Axis button and select the z-axis from the Origin folder 
in the browser. An arrow appears, showing the connection direction, as shown in 
Figure 18.7. The default connection type is Female, but you can set it to Male or Neutral 
(for fl anged or butt-welded fi ttings).
Figure 18.7

8. The Engagement settings defi ne the maximum and minimum overlap between the con-
nector and pipe. The router needs a range because the pipe usually has a minimum 

834 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
length increment. The engagement range allows the router to adjust the position of the 
pipe in the fi ttings.
 
9. To determine the engagement, navigate to the Design Data folder (the default location 
is C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Inventor 2015\Design Data) and open Threads
.xls. Select the NPT For PVC Pipe And Fitting tab. For tapered threads, the engagement 
value depends on how tightly the fi tting is screwed onto the pipe. You need the maxi-
mum engagement value, so add the Handtight Engagement value, which is 0.32, and the 
Wrench Makeup, Internal value, which is 0.1429. Set Max to Distance, and enter 0.4629 
for the total value. For Min, divide the Handtight Engagement value, 0.32, by the total 
engagement value, 0.4629, which comes to 69%.
 
10. Click the 2 button to defi ne the other connection.
 
11. In this example, Socket Welded was chosen as the End Treatment setting since that 
seemed to be the best description. You should choose an end treatment that is consistent 
with your other parts.
 
12. Select a circle at the opposite end of the part for the connection point and select the z-axis 
again. You will see that the arrow points into the adapter and the orange line represent-
ing the engagement is outside the part. Using the fl ip/arrow button next to the Axis 
button, change the direction so that the arrow is to the outside and engagement is to the 
inside, as shown in Figure 18.8.
Figure 18.8
Connection 
direction and 
engagement
 
13. The depth of the socket is 0.84 inch. You don’t want to design to full-depth engagement 
because of tolerances, so set Max to Distance and specify 0.75 as the depth. For Min, 
accept the default value of 50%.
 
14. The ISOGEN data is optional. For this exercise, this information will be left blank. Click 
the OK button to complete authoring the adapter.

TUBE AND PIPE | 835
Now that the part has been authored as a tube and pipe adaptor, it is ready to be published 
to a read/write Content Center library. You can fi nd more information on publishing parts to 
Content Center in Chapter 7, “Reusing Parts and Features.”
Placing Fittings
Fittings can be placed from Content Center or from a user-created directory of authored fi ttings. 
As a rule, you should use the place tools found on the Tube and Pipe tab rather than placing fi t-
tings as you would normal assembly parts. The place options on the Tube and Pipe tabs ensure 
that the authored connections are used as intended. Figure 18.9 shows the place options avail-
able on the Pipe Run tab.
Figure 18.9
Place options 
available on the 
Pipe Run tab
When fi ttings are placed, either from Content Center or from a user-defi ned library of authored 
fi ttings, you can drag the fi tting over the route segments or nodes, and you will see the placement 
point appear. Use the spacebar to toggle through available orientations if more than one exists. 
When you click to place the fi tting, the Select Orientation tool appears, allowing you to rotate the 
orientation to the desired position.
You can edit connections by right-clicking them while the route is active for edits and choos-
ing Edit Fitting Connections. In the Edit Connections dialog box, you can select a segment and 
then use the X button to remove the connection. You can also select Change Fitting Diameter, as 
shown in Figure 18.10.

836 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Quickly Place Fittings
If you need additional ﬁ ttings that are identical to previously placed or populated ﬁ ttings, you can 
select the ﬁ tting and then select the Place Fitting button from the Route panel. Th is will place a 
new ﬁ tting that matches the existing ﬁ tting. Note that you can do the same thing by selecting the 
ﬁ tting and right-clicking and choosing Place Fitting.
If your model contains a ﬁ tting of a certain size and you want to place the same family of ﬁ tting 
but in a diﬀ erent size, you can select the existing ﬁ tting and then select the Place button from 
the Content panel. Th is will open Content Center with that ﬁ tting family active, allowing you to 
double-click the family and select the new size.
Creating Routes
Routes defi ne the path for pipe and hose segments and the corresponding fi ttings. Route paths 
can have a simple start point and endpoint or can include as many intermediate points as are 
required. Several tools and options are used to start and create route paths:
Authored Connection Points  You can use any of the predefi ned connection points for any 
library fi tting or custom-authored part. When you move your mouse pointer over the library 
fi tting, the connection point(s) will highlight.
Circular Edges  You can use any circular edge in the assembly to set the route point at the 
center of it with the exception of authored parts such as fi ttings. For those parts, only the 
authored connection points can be used.
Precise and Offset Start Points  You can hover your mouse pointer over an edge to dis-
play a direction arrow. Running your mouse pointer along that arrow allows you to select 
the arrow to set the offset at that distance, or you can right-click and choose Enter Distance. 
If the arrow points in the wrong direction, you can use the spacebar to toggle it or right-
click and choose Select Other Direction. Figure 18.11 shows the offset start point options.
Figure 18.11

Turning on Dynamic Prompts
You can watch the lower left of your screen to see the help prompts Inventor gives you as you select 
tools and hover over objects on the screen, or you can turn on Dynamic Prompts to place these tips 
at your cursor so they are more noticeable.
To turn on Dynamic Prompts, go to the Tools tab and click the Application Options button; then 
click the General tab, locate the Prompting Interaction area in the dialog box, and select the Show 
Command Prompting (Dynamic Prompts) option.

TUBE AND PIPE | 837
3D Orthogonal Route Tool  Once a start point is selected, run your mouse pointer along the 
projected axis and click or use the context menu’s Enter Distance option to set a value for the sec-
ond point. You will then be presented with the 3D Orthogonal Route tool. You can use the con-
trol handles to change the angle or rotate the control. The cross arrow toggles between 90-degree 
and 45-degree solutions, and the arc arrows allow you to rotate the route tool. You can also right-
click and choose Custom Bend to enter an angle other than 90 or 45. When you enter a Custom 
Bend angle that cannot be accommodated with an elbow fi tting, Inventor will place a bend in the 
tube or pipe segment. When the 3D Orthogonal Route tool is displayed, you can use the + and – 
keys to change the size of it on-screen. Figure 18.12 shows the 3D Orthogonal Route tool in use.
Figure 18.12
Using the 3D 
Orthogonal 
Route tool
Route Nodes  When placing a point along a route or setting an offset start point, you will see 
a colored dot tracking along the Route tool. If it is a yellow X, the offset is not enough to create a 
minimum segment as set in the style rules, and the point cannot be selected. If it is a blue dot, 
the segment might be too short to accommodate an elbow, but you are allowed to select it. If it 
is a green dot, the location is satisfactory to all of the style rules. You can right-click and choose 
Enter Distance to display an input box. In Figure 18.13, the node (which looks like a dot) at the 
left of the image shows the placement with a distance of 2200 mm entered.
Figure 18.13
Route nodes
Autoroute Options  You can select the start point and endpoint of a route and use the Auto-
route tool to fl ip through the available Autoroute solutions. You can also use this to close two 
parts of an already created route. Use the Select Other tool to toggle through all the Autoroute 
variations. Once an Autoroute is created, use the Move Segment button to adjust the segments 
and create new solutions. Figure 18.14 shows an Autoroute with a suggested variation.

838 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS

options
Sketched Routes  Route paths can also be based on an existing 3D sketch. These 3D sketches 
are used as the route by deriving the geometry into the route. Changes to the 3D sketch update 
the route automatically. You can use the Include Geometry tool to include any existing part 
edges in the route. You can also switch to the 3D Sketch tab while creating a route and use the 
standard 3D sketch tools to create route geometry as required. Whether routing in the tool or 
using a derived route, watch the visual cues offered by the sketch.
Creating a Route from an Existing Sketch
Now you will use a combination of tools to create a pipe and tubing route based on an existing 
sketch:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button and browse to the Chapter 18 directory in 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder.
 
2. Open the fi le mi_18a_015.iam.
 
3. From the Environments tab, select the Tube And Pipe button on the Begin panel.
 
4. Accept the defaults offered in the Create Tube And Pipe Run dialog by clicking the OK 
button.
In the browser you will see that a run has been created and it is active. There is also a 
specialized tab added to the ribbon named Pipe Run.
 
5. From the Manage panel of the Pipe Run tab, use the pull-down to select the B36.10M-
ASME B16.11 – Steel Threaded Pipe style.
 
6. Select the New Route button from the Route panel.
 
7. Make note of the route part fi le location and then click the OK button to approve the 
default values for the Create Route dialog.

TUBE AND PIPE | 839
 
8. Another new tab will appear named Route. Select the Derived Route button from the 
Create panel.
 
9. Select the path that is already present in the assembly, as shown in Figure 18.15.
Figure 18.15
Selecting an exist-
ing 3D sketch as a 
piping route
 
10. Right-click and select Done from the context menu to use the selected sketch as part of 
your pipe route.
This will add four route points to the route in the browser. Rather than focusing on all of 
the geometry, you’ll use just the points, which improves the assembly performance for 
the initial calculations and updates.
 
11. Select the Finish Route tool from the Route tab to return to the Pipe Run tools.
 
12. From the Route panel, select the Populate Route button to create the pipe and fi ttings for 
this route.
 
13. Once the route is populated, you can select the Finish Tube And Pipe Run button. Your 
pipe run should look like Figure 18.16.
Figure 18.16
Th e piping run 
created from the 
3D sketch

840 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
14. Select the Finish Tube And Pipe button on the Tube And Pipe tab to exit the tube and pipe 
environment and return to the top level of the assembly.
 
15. In the browser, expand the mi_18a_012 part in the browser and double-click the 3D 
sketch to edit it.
 
16. Change the 9-inch dimension in the sketch to 11.
 
17. Change the 135-degree dimension that does not have parentheses around it to 90, as 
shown in Figure 18.17.
Figure 18.17
Th e updated 3D 
sketch
 
18. Click the Finish Sketch button and then click the Return button to update the assembly 
and the pipe route that you created based on it.
 
19. Turn off the visibility of the 3D sketch by right-clicking the sketch in the browser.
The use of a 3D sketch is not necessary to place a run like this, but it can be easier for some 
users to visualize the route before starting the routing tools. It is also a great tool for people 
who’ve used 3D sketches and sweep features to replicate piping runs in the past. You can save 
your work if you want to investigate the folders and fi le paths created, or you can close the fi le 
without saving changes and continue to the next set of steps.
Creating a Route Using the D Orthogonal Route Tool
Now you’ll look at using the 3D Orthogonal Route tool to create a tubing section when no 3D 
sketch tool exists. To do so, open the fi le mi_18a_016.iam from the Chapter 18 directory. Then 
follow these steps:
 
1. From the Environments tab, select the Tube And Pipe button and click the OK button in 
the dialog to create a new run, noting that the run name has been incremented from the 
previous run.
 
2. In the Manage panel, set the style to ASTM B 88-ASME B16.22 – Soldered Copper Tubing.
 
3. Select the New Route button and click the OK button to accept the default naming.
 
4. Select the Route button from the Create panel.
 
5. Rotate the assembly so you can see the inside of the short fl ange of the base part. You will 
be working with the light-blue center fi tting.

TUBE AND PIPE | 841
 
6. As you near the fi tting’s point of engagement, arrows indicating the initial direction of 
a run will appear. If you hover your cursor over the various circular edges of the fi tting, 
you’ll see the arrows fl ip directions. Select the option that will set the direction toward 
the fi ttings on the other fl ange of the base part, as shown in Figure 18.18, and click the 
mouse button when it is highlighted.
Figure 18.18
Setting the direc-
tion toward the 
other ﬁ ttings
After the selection is made, a centerline will be displayed. Move your cursor along the 
line, and a dimension will display the distance from the selected point, as shown in 
Figure 18.19. You can increase the length of the line by pressing the + key on the keyboard, 
or you can use the keyboard to enter an explicit value. If you move your cursor to the 2.000 
location or a location with a lower value, you’ll see the selection indicator change to a yel-
low X. For anything above 2.000 the selection indicator will change to a green dot. This 
behavior is due to the bend radius default listed on the Rules tab of the Tube & Pipe Styles 
dialog box.
Figure 18.19
Th e preview 
allows you to 
visually place the 
end of the ﬁ rst 
segment
 
7. Type 7 on the keyboard to set the length and press Enter to create the fi rst segment at 7 
inches.
 
8. After the fi rst segment appears and the route nodes appear, right-click in an open area of 
the design window and ensure that Rotation Snap is selected in the context menu.
Rotation Snap
Th e Rotation Snap option allows you to snap to the other ﬁ tting in the middle of the rotate action 
so that the angle is derived from the selections. If you happen to know the angle needed, you can 
simply click and drag the curved rotation arrow and enter an angle.

842 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
9. Click and drag the curved arrow on the green axis, move your mouse to the opposite fi t-
ting (as shown in Figure 18.20), and select that fi tting.
Figure 18.20

Restarting a Route
If at any time during the creation of a route you make a mistake in selection, simply use the Undo 
button to back up a step, click the Route tool again, and click the end of your last route segment.
This method will align the route nodes to the second fi tting and allows a great deal of 
fl exibility in building a complex route.
 
10. Click the end of the second fi tting to set an endpoint for the route.
 
11. This will present a preview of a route. The preview will include the number of segments 
and the Select Other tool so you can cycle between options.
 
12. Click the green arrows of the Select Other tool until you see the option that will create 
three segments and then click the green icon in the center of the Select Other tool to set 
the route.
 
13. Finish the route and then click the Populate Route button from the Pipe Run tab to popu-
late the route with parts.
 
14. Select Finish Tube And Pipe Run.
Using the 3D Orthogonal Route tool allows you to create a route based on existing geometry 
without the need to use an existing sketch. This can speed up the layout process and simplify 
your design. You can save your work if you want to investigate the folders and fi le paths created, 
or you can close the fi le without saving changes and continue to the next set of steps.
Creating a Flexible Hose Route
Flexible hose routes are similar to rigid pipe routes with just a few exceptions. Whereas a rigid 
pipe path is a series of line segments connected with arcs or points, a fl exible hose path consists 

TUBE AND PIPE | 843
of a single spline segment. Flexible routes offer a couple of tools and options specifi c to this 
type of route, such as the ability to right-click a surface, select Enter Offset, and then adjust the 
hose length. You can open the fi le mi_18a_017.iam from the Chapter 18 directory and use the 
options in these steps to create a fl exible hose route:
 
1. Locate and right-click the Tube & Pipe Runs 01 node in the browser and choose Edit.
 
2. Select the Create Pipe Run button and accept the defaults.
 
3. Set the style to Hydraulic Hose–Male Taper Thread.
 
4. Select the New Route button and click the OK button to accept the default naming.
 
5. Click the Route button.
With this style of hose, rather than selecting an existing fi tting on which the hose will 
begin, you’ll be asked to select the location for two fi ttings that will be placed before any 
routing options are offered.
 
6. Place the fi rst fi tting on the remaining unused anchor fi tting on the small fl ange of the 
sheet-metal base part.
 
7. Place the second fi tting on the last remaining fi tting on the opposite side.
Placing the second fi tting will generate the spline centerline of the hose. At this point you 
can create additional points offset from faces on the part or even use natural centers on 
curved faces to pass the hose through.
 
8. Select the curved edge of the hose retainer, as shown in Figure 18.21, to route the hose 
through the retainer.
Figure 18.21
Routing the hose 
through a retainer
 
9. Once the hose center is displayed, use the Hose Length tool in the Manage panel and use 
the slide bar to set the hose length to 44 inches.
 
10. Click the OK button to complete the path for the hose.
 
11. Finish and populate the route and then fi nish the tube and pipe run. Compare it to 
Figure 18.22.

844 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Figure 18.22
Th e completed 
routes
There are a number of options for creating these routes that you should explore. You also 
have the ability to add fi ttings inline. These added fi ttings will break the segments of pipes 
and tubes to create room for the fi ttings and set their engagement with the fi ttings auto-
matically. If you later remove the fi tting, the pipe will be “healed” and restored to a single 
segment.
Exporting ISOGEN Files
Often isometric centerline drawings are required for documentation of tube and pipe designs. 
The ISOGEN Output tool is available on both the Tube And Pipe tab and the Pipe Run tab. You 
can save all your tube and pipe runs as an ISOGEN (*.pcf) fi le directly from the master run 
assembly; just click the ISOGEN Output button on the Tube And Pipe tab. Or you can use the 
ISOGEN Output button while at an individual run level to save just that run. When fl anged 
routes are created, gaskets are required for fl anged connections if ISOGEN fi les are to be cre-
ated from them.
Cable and Harness
The cable and harness tools in Inventor are based on the fundamental tools of part and 
 assembly creation; however, the parts and assemblies created with the cable and harness tools 
are structured differently than standard part and assembly models. Understanding these differ-
ences requires a solid understanding of the way standard parts and assemblies are created and 
structured. In the following sections, you will explore the creation and placement of electrical 
parts, harnesses, wires, cables, and segments as well as how to copy and document cable and 
harness designs.

CABLE AND HARNESS | 845
Creating and Placing Electrical Parts
You can use any Inventor model as an electrical connector by adding pin features specifi c to 
cables and harnesses to it. Parts can be created from scratch using standard modeling tech-
niques or downloaded from supplier websites as well as a number of 3D content websites, such 
as http://mfgcommunity.autodesk.com/content/.
When downloading content from the Internet, you will often fi nd models in other formats, 
such as STEP, IGES, SolidWorks, and so on. These fi les can be translated into Inventor fi les using 
the methods described in Chapter 14, “Exchanging Data with Other Systems.”
Authoring Electrical Components
The basic steps to turn a standard Inventor part into an electrical component are as follows:
 
1. Open the part fi le in Inventor.
 
2. Click the Place Pin button in the Harness panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
3. Select one of the following to place the pin:
 
◆
Center point of any circular edge, face, or hole
 
◆
Visible sketch points
 
◆
Work points
 
◆
Model vertex points
 
◆
Any model face
 
4. Enter a unique pin name/number.
 
5. Click the Harness Properties button in the pin-naming input box to enter additional pin 
properties if required.
 
6. Repeat steps 3 and 5 for each pin.
 
7. Click the Harness Properties tool in the Harness panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
8. Enter a reference designator (RefDes) placeholder. The RefDes property is intended to 
be used at the assembly level, where each instance of the connector will have a unique 
RefDes.
 
9. Select a Gender option (Male, Female, or None).
 
10. Set a wire offset point if required.
Creating a Connector
In the following steps, you will open an existing Inventor part fi le and create pins as just 
described. Figure 18.23 shows the Harness tools available in the parts environment.

846 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Figure 18.23
Harness part tools
Follow these steps to explore the steps used in creating a connector:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for the fi le mi_18a_007.ipt in the Chapter 18 directory of the Mastering 
Inventor 2015 folder and open it.
 
3. Click the Place Pin button in the Harness panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
4. Select the visible sketch point.
 
5. Enter A1 in the Place Pin input box and click the Harness Properties button.
 
6. Select the Custom tab, click the Name drop-down, and select Embedded Length.
 
7. Enter 5 mm in the Value input box, click Add, and then click the OK button. Then click 
the green check mark or press Enter on the keyboard to set the pin.
 
8. To place the next pin, click the rounded edge on one of the top cutouts, enter A2 for the 
pin name, and then set the pin without entering any harness properties. Click the green 
check mark to set the pin.
 
9. Click roughly in the center of the blue square face to set the third pin and enter B1 for the 
name. Click the green check mark to set the pin.
 
10. Right-click and choose Done to exit the Place Pin tool.
 
11. In the Work Features panel of the 3D Model tab, click the Point button to create a work 
point.
 
12. Right-click and select Loop Select and then click the square profi le edge for the 
remaining cutout. Be certain you are selecting the outer edge loop and not the 
inner loop. 
 
13. Select the Place Pin tool again and select the work point you just created. Set the name to 
B2, right-click, and choose Done.
 
14. Edit Extrusion1 and change the Distance from 10 mm to 15 mm.
Notice which work points hold their positions relative to the geometry and which ones 
remain at the position in which they were created. You can right-click the pins that didn’t update 
as expected and choose Redefi ne Feature or 3D Move/Rotate to adjust them. Understanding 
how pin locations will update is important when defi ning a connector part intended for use in 
iPart creation, where you will want the pin location to update as different pin sizes are created. 
For static pins not likely to change, nonassociative pins work just fi ne.
In addition to redefi ning the pin location, you can right-click any pin in the browser and 
choose Harness Properties to change the name or add/edit properties. Keep in mind that pin 
names must be unique.

CABLE AND HARNESS | 847
Place Pin Groups
Although the Place Pin tool works well for defi ning pins not arranged in a pattern or for small 
numbers of patterned pins, you can use the Place Pin Group tool to place larger numbers of pat-
terned pins. The following steps explore the Place Pin Group tool:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_18a_009.ipt in the Chapter 18 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and open it.
 
3. Click the Place Pin Group button in the Harness panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
4. For Start Location, select WorkPoint1.
 
5. Enter 8 for the number of pins per row.
 
6. Enter 4.5 mm for the pin pitch (spacing) and then select an edge to establish the pin direc-
tion. Use the fl ip arrow if required.
 
7. Enter 2 for the number of rows.
 
8. Enter 4.5 mm for the row pitch and then select an edge to establish the pin direction. Use 
the fl ip arrow if required.
 
9. Enter A for the prefi x letter and 101 for the start number.
 
10. Switch the radio button for the numbering scheme options to Sequential Column, then to 
Circumventing, and then back to Sequential Row to see the differences in each.
 
11. Click the OK button to set the pins. Figure 18.24 shows the Place Pin Group dialog box 
settings and pin group.
Figure 18.24
Creating a pin 
group

848 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Notice the 16 pins created and listed in the Model browser. You can right-click any of 
the pins and choose Edit Pin Group to change the start point, spacing, and direction if 
required. You can also right-click and select Delete Pin Group to start over, or you can 
select Delete to remove an individual pin. Note too that you can right-click any of the 
pins and choose Redefi ne Feature to set an individual pin to a nonpatterned location.
As a fi nal step, you will create four work points in front of the connector for use later as a 
stop point for the wire or cable segment.
 
12. Click the Point button on the Work Features panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
13. Right-click and ensure that Loop Select is not selected.
 
14. Click the edge of the visible work plane and then one of the work axes. You’ll see a work 
point created at the intersection. Do the same for the remaining three axes and then right-
click each axis and the plane and turn off their visibility.
The work points allow you to place the end-of-wire segments appropriately off the connector. 
Figure 18.25 shows a connector utilizing a segment-end work point.
Figure 18.25
Work points for 
segment ends
Creating a Harness
Electrical components, including connectors, wires, and cables, are assembled and constructed 
within a harness subassembly. Although you can place connectors at any structure level within 
the assembly and route wires to them, as a rule you typically place connectors within the har-
ness assembly when the harness and connectors are purchased together so that your BOM will 
refl ect the harness as an item. The steps for creating and routing a wire harness are as follows:
 
1. In an assembly fi le, place and constrain connector parts that will not be part of the har-
ness assembly into the assembly either at the top level or within a subassembly.
 
2. Click the Cable And Harness button on the Begin panel of the Environments tab.
 
3. Enter a name and location for the harness subassembly fi le to be created.
 
4. Place and constrain connectors to be part of the harness.
 
5. Use the Create Wire, Create Cable, or Create Ribbon Cable tool to connect the pins of the

6. Use the Create Segment tool to create wire bundles, routing them around geometry 
obstacles of other parts in the assembly.
 
7. Use the Route or Automatic Route tool to route the wires or cables through the segments 
(wire bundles).
 
8. Use the Create Splice tool to create wire or segment splices as required.
When a harness is created, it is composed of a harness assembly fi le and a harness part fi le 
of the same name. The part fi le is the container in which the wires, cables, and segments will be 
built as they are added. Both fi les make up the overall harness and are required for the harness 
to work. Inventor will warn you if you try to edit these fi les directly rather than through a top-
level assembly using the wire harness tools.
In the following steps, you will open an existing Inventor assembly fi le, create a simple har-
ness assembly, and then place connectors:
 
1. On the Get Started tab, click the Open button.
 
2. Browse for mi_18a_018.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and open it.
 
3. On the Environments tab, click the Cable And Harness button in the Begin panel.
 
4. Accept the default name and location for the new harness assembly, and click the OK 
 button. Note the harness subassembly and part nodes listed in the browser.
 
5. Click the Assemble tab, and then click the Place Component button.
 
6. Browse for and locate the connector fi le mi_18a_004.ipt and click the Open button.
 
7. Click twice in the graphics area to place two instances of the connector; then right-click 
and select Cancel.
To assemble the connectors (residing in the subassembly) to the base part (residing in 
the top-level assembly), you’ll need to return to the top-level assembly and place the 
constraints. Parts within the harness can constrain to the parts in the top-level assembly 
because the harness subassembly is adaptive.
 
8. Click the Finish Cable And Harness button to return to the top-level assembly.
 
9. Place an Insert constraint on the connectors and the holes on the outside fl anges. Ensure 
that the connector pins face the inside of the base part.
 
10. Click the Finish Cable And Harness button to return to the top-level assembly. You can 
close this fi le when fi nished.
This simple exercise illustrates the steps required to create a harness subassembly and place 
connectors within it. You can also place connectors in the top-level assembly before creating the 
harness assembly and then demote components from the top-level assembly into the harness 
subassembly. To do so, follow these general steps:
 
1. Place the connectors in the top-level assembly.
 
2. Create the harness assembly.

850 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
3. While the harness subassembly is active, expand it in the browser.
 
4. Click the connector components in the browser and drag them down into the harness 
assembly.
Setting Global Harness Settings
You can access the settings for the entire harness by right-clicking the top-level node of the harness 
in the browser while it is active for edits.
Placing Wires
Once the harness assembly is created and the electrical connector parts are added and con-
strained, you can add wires and/or cables. When wires are created, you enter a unique wire 
ID name, select a wire category, and set the wire name (type). Then you select the two pins 
from which and to which you want to run a wire. To see how the Create Wire tool works, open 
mi_18a_020.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and 
follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the harness subassembly to set it active for edits (or right-click it and 
choose Edit).
 
2. On the Cable And Harness tab, click the Create Wire button.
 
3. Set Wire ID to Wire101.
 
4. Select Generic from the Category drop-down.
 
5. Set the Name drop-down to 14AWG-BLK.
 
6. Select Pin 1 (work point) on one of the red connectors for the Pin 1 selection. You’ll see the 
pin number when you pause your mouse pointer over the pin. Figure 18.26 shows the pin 
selection and wire settings.
Figure 18.26
Placing a wire 
on pin 1
 
7. Select pin 1 (work point) on the other red connector for the pin 2 selection.
 
8. Click Apply to set the wire. It should run in a straight line between the two connectors.
 
9. Set the remaining three pins for the red connectors as listed here:

CABLE AND HARNESS | 851
 
◆
Pin 2 = Wire102, Generic 14AWG-RED
 
◆
Pin 3 = Wire103, Generic 14AWG-WHT
 
◆
Pin 4 = Wire104, Generic 14AWG-GRN
 
10. Click Cancel to exit the Create Wire dialog box.
 
11. In this assembly, a segment (blue wire bundle) has already been created. Click the Route 
button to route a wire through the segment.
 
12. Click just one of the wires for the Wires selection and then click the segment for the First 
Segment selection.
 
13. Select the Single Segment check box and then click Apply. Note that the segment will 
shrink to size based on the wire.
 
14. Click Cancel to exit the Route dialog box and then click the Automatic Route button.
 
15. In the Auto Route dialog box, select the All Unrouted Wires check box, and click the OK 
button.
 
16. Expand the Harness1 part node in the browser, and you’ll notice a Wires folder contain-
ing all of the wires you created. Right-click Wire101, and choose Harness Properties. 
Browse the tab to examine the read/write and read-only properties available for this 
wire. When fi nished, return to the Occurrence tab, set Bend Radius to 2 × Diameter, and 
then click the OK button.
 
17. Right-click the Wires folder in the browser and select Bend Radius ➢ Check All Bend 
Radii.
 
18. Note that you will receive a warning stating that one or more objects contain an empty 
bend radius. Click the OK button, and note that wires 102 through 104 are marked with a 
warning icon in the browser.
In this case, the warning indicates the bend radius has not been set. You can edit the wire 
property, set the bend radius, and then repeat the bend radii check. If the bend radius 
for each wire in the model is in compliance with the setting for that wire, then the check 
will clear. Editing segments will be covered later, in the section “Placing and Editing 
Segments.” Now that the problem area is identifi ed, you could make the decision to either 
change the general layout of the assembly or edit the segment route to change the fi t so 
that the bend isn’t so sharp.
 
19. Click the Finish Cable & Harness button to return to the top-level assembly. You can close 
this fi le when fi nished.
This simple exercise demonstrated how to create wires in a harness and the routing of these 
wires in an existing segment. The wire categories and names listed in the Create Wires dialog 
box are drawn from the Cable & Harness library.
Using the Cable & Harness Library
The Cable & Harness library is located in the Design Data folder but can be set per harness. 
In most cases, you will want to confi gure it per the Inventor Design Data folder. You can set 

852 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
this option by right-clicking a harness assembly while it is active for edits, selecting Harness 
Settings, and then selecting the File Locations tab.
The library fi le that installs by default is Cable&HarnessDefaultLibrary.iwl. You can 
locate this fi le by checking the Design Data path in your Inventor project fi le (*.ipj) or by 
selecting the File tab of the Application Options dialog box. Recall that the project Design Data 
path trumps the application’s Options path if set.
To add objects to the Cable & Harness library, click the Library button on the Manage panel of 
the Cable And Harness tab. You can add new wire, cable, and segment objects, just to name a few, 
and you can create your own custom object type. Figure 18.27 shows the library being edited.

Harness library
Placing Cables
Adding cables is much like adding wires. To explore the cable tools, open the fi le mi_18a_022
.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. Then follow these 
steps:
 
1. Double-click the harness subassembly to set it active for edits, or right-click it and 
select Edit.
 
2. Click the Create Cable button on the Cable And Harness tab.
 
3. Set Cable ID to C201, and set Category to Alpha.
 
4. Select 2254/4 from the Name drop-down.
 
5. Note that Conductor ID 1 is set active. Select pin 1 (work point) on one of the gray con-
nectors for the pin 1 selection. You’ll see the pin number when you pause your mouse 
pointer over the pin.
 
6. Select pin 1 (work point) on the other gray connector for the pin 2 selection. Note that the 
conductor ID advances automatically to the next line.
 
7. Set the remaining three pins for the gray connectors as listed here:
 
◆
Pin 2 = C201:2, Red
 
◆
Pin 3 = C201:3, White
 
◆
Pin 4 = C201:4, Green
 
8. Click the OK button to set the cable.

CABLE AND HARNESS | 853
 
9. Click the Automatic Route button, select the All Unrouted Wires check box, and click the 
OK button.
 
10. Expand the Cables folder in the browser and then right-click the listed cable and choose 
Harness Properties. Note that the bend radius is set to 10 × Diameter. If you click in the 
input box, you will see that the value is being pulled from the Cable & Harness library. 
Click the OK button to exit the dialog box.
 
11. Right-click the cable, and choose Bend Radius ➢ Check. Click the OK button in the warn-
ing dialog box.
 
12. Note that the cable browser node has turned red and displays a warning sign next to 
it to indicate a problem. Right-click it in the browser, and select Bend Radius ➢ Show 
Violations. You will see a red marker on the segment in the graphics area along with a 
dialog box. Click the OK button.
 
13. Click the Finish Cable And Harness button to return to the top-level assembly. You can 
close this fi le when fi nished.
The Check Bend Radius function allows you to locate problem areas with a design. You 
could remedy the violation here either by adjusting the segment points in an attempt to 
modify the fi t of the cable route or by moving components and/or features in the  assembly. 
Often a design might require adjusting both the assembly arrangement and the cable 
 routing. But it’s important to be able to check for bend radius violations so that you can 
determine what needs adjustment. In the next section, you will explore segment creation 
and editing.
Placing and Editing Segments
Segments are used to defi ne the route path in which wires and cables will be run though a 
design to avoid interference and identify possible problem areas where bend radii may be too 
tight. A segment is created by selecting geometry on-screen, either outright or as an offset base. 
For each selection or offset point, a work point is created.
Once segments are created, you can refi ne them by adding points or redefi ning existing 
points. To explore the cable tools, open the fi le mi_18a_024.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the harness subassembly to set it active for edits, or right-click it and 
select Edit.
 
2. Click the Create Segment button on the Cable And Harness tab.
 
3. You will fi rst run a route segment from the red to green connectors. Select the work point 
in front of the red connector for the start point of the segment.
 
4. Click any circular edge on the black grommet hole; this will select the center. Repeat this 
for the green grommet hole.
 
5. For the third point, you will specify an offset value and then select the fl ange with the 
two square-shaped notches along the top.
 
a. Right-click and choose Edit Offset.

854 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
b. Enter 10 mm in the Edit Offset box and then click the OK button.
 
c. Rub your mouse pointer around on different faces to observe the way the offset 
behaves. Then select roughly in the center of the face of the notched fl ange in front of 
the green connector.
 
6. Select the work point in front of the green connector.
 
7. Right-click and choose Continue.
 
8. Create another short segment from the orange connector and tie it into the fi rst segment. 
Select the work point in front of the orange connector.
 
9. Click the work point at the center of the green grommet hole, and right-click and select 
Finish. Figure 18.28 shows the segments.
Figure 18.28
Th e created 
segments
Use the Automatic Route tool and select the All Unrouted Wires option to route the wires 
through the segments. Upon doing so, you’ll notice two things:
 
◆
The segments adjust to compensate for the wire diameters.
 
◆
The cable coming off the blue connector has routed in an undesirable way.
Use the Unroute tool and select any of the wires at the blue connector. Because they all 
belong to a cable, you need to select only one, and then they all highlight. Once they are 
unrouted, you can use the Create Segment tool to create a new segment from the blue connector 
to the black grommet hole and then use Route or Automatic Route to reroute the cable. 
Importing Wire Data from AutoCAD Electrical
Depending on the size and structure of your design department, you might want to import sche-
matic data created by AutoCAD® Electrical software users. You can use the Import Harness Data 
tool in Inventor Professional or routed systems to connect multiple wires and cables in the harness 
assembly based on a schematic created in AutoCAD Electrical. A key to doing this successfully is 
making sure the wire and connector numbering is unique throughout the schematic. To do this, 
you must ﬁ rst export the harness data from AutoCAD Electrical as described in these steps:
 1. On the Import/Export Data tab, click the Inventor button. 

CABLE AND HARNESS | 855
 2. In the Export dialog box, specify the scope of the export (export the project or just the current 
drawing) and then click the OK button.
 3. In the XML File Export dialog box, deﬁ ne the location and ﬁ lename for the export ﬁ le.
Once the data is exported from AutoCAD Electrical, you can import it into Inventor as described 
in these steps:
 1. Double-click the harness assembly in which you want to import the harness data.
 2. Check and/or assign reference designators on the connector and splice occurrences used in the 
harness data ﬁ le to ensure that the names match the schematic.
 3. Click the Import Harness Data button on the Cable And Harness tab. Th en browse for the harness 
data ﬁ le (.xml or .csv) exported from AutoCAD Electrical. If you’re importing a CSV ﬁ le, click 
Browse to locate the conﬁ guration ﬁ le (.cfg).
 4. Click the OK button to add the harness data to the active harness assembly.
Th e properties imported from AutoCAD Electrical are as follows:
 
◆
Component tags imported as RefDes
 
◆
Wire numbers imported as the wire ID
 
◆
Th e cable conductor wire layer imported as the cable ID
You’ll notice that the middle section of the segment needs to be adjusted. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Run your mouse pointer over the centerline of the segment, right-click, and choose Add 
Points.
 
2. Select roughly in the middle of the segment and then right-click and select Finish.
 
3. Right-click the new work point and select Redefi ne Point.
 
4. Right-click, select Edit Offset, enter 10 mm for the offset value, and click the OK button.
 
5. Click roughly in the center of the square emboss on the base part.
 
6. Make an adjustment using the 3D triad. Right-click the same work point and select 3D 
Move/Rotate.
 
7. Click the blue cone (z-axis) of the triad, enter 4 mm, and then click Apply.
 
8. Select the small plane between the blue arrow and the green arrow (YZ plane), enter 
-6 mm in both the Y and Z inputs, and then click the OK button.
 
9. Edit the segment type. Select Assign Virtual Parts on the Cable And Harness tab and 
select the centerline of all the segments. From the Type drop-down, select Loom. Set the 
Category drop-down to Sample, set the Name drop-down to Wire Sleeve, click the Add 
button, and then click the OK button. Note that the selections in this dialog box are inter-
dependent. For instance, you might need to set the category fi rst to get the option selec-
tions for the name.

856 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
Segment Defaults
You set the default Edit Oﬀ set, Color Style, and Diameter settings, and more per harness by right-
clicking the harness browser node, selecting Harness Settings, and then selecting the Segments tab.
Because the middle segment routes all the wires and the cable, it is larger in diameter. This is 
based on a setting in the harness properties. To determine its evaluated size, right-click the seg-
ment centerline and choose Harness Properties. You can determine the diameter at the bottom 
of the Occurrence tab. Because the grommet holes have an inside diameter of 10 mm, you can 
make a judgment as to whether a larger hole size is required.
On the Wire/Cables tab of the Segment Properties dialog box, you can review the wire and 
cable information. Double-clicking a line item will open the properties of that wire or cable. 
Figure 18.29 shows the properties of a wire contained in a segment.
Figure 18.29

Copying Cable and Harness Designs
Because of the adaptive relationships between assemblies and the harness assemblies and 
their containing harness part fi le, copying existing harness and assembly designs must be 
done in a particular way so as not to break the adaptive relationship between the original 
fi les when working on the new fi les. Before looking at the steps to copy a harness, take a look 
at Figure 18.30 to understand the fi les involved. Each harness comprises an assembly fi le, 
where you can place connectors and other components, and a part fi le, where the wires, cables, 
 segments, and other harness components are created.
Figure 18.30
Harness assembly 
structure
To copy a harness design, open the fi le mi_18a_028.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. Then follow these steps:

CABLE AND HARNESS | 857
 
1. Expand the assembly browser so that you can identify the harness assembly and part 
nodes.
Notice that the harness used in the assembly is called mi_18a_26. Harness2 and the part 
within is named the same. This is because this top-level assembly fi le was created by 
using the Save Copy As tool and, therefore, still references the original harness. Although 
it may seem logical to use the assembly Replace tool or some other method to swap out 
the harness, such methods can’t be used because the adaptive relationships must be 
updated throughout the fi le references.
 
2. Right-click the mi_18a_26.Harness2.iam fi le in the browser, and choose Delete.
 
3. Click the No button in the prompt box so that adaptivity is not cleared in the original 
assembly.
 
4. On the Assemble tab, click the Place button.
 
5. Browse for the Harness_Files folder in the Chapter 18 directory, select mi_18a_26
.Harness1.iam, and click the Open button.
 
6. Click anywhere in the graphics screen to place the harness; then right-click and select OK 
or Cancel.
 
7. Typically, you would constrain the harness using assembly constraints at this point. 
For the purpose of this exercise, though, you don’t have to do so. Instead, right-click 
the harness assembly in the browser and choose Make Adaptive. If prompted to save, 
click Yes.
 
8. In the Make Adaptive dialog box, you can set the new names for harness fi les or accept 
the default names.
 
9. In the Location area at the bottom of the dialog box, click the Browse button, browse for 
the Harness_Files folder in the Chapter 18 directory, and then click the OK button. 
Note that by default, a subdirectory of the same name as the top assembly is created 
along with subfolders for the component organization. You can accept this path and just 
make that part of your standard fi le management if you like.
 
10. Click the OK button and the new fi les are created, are made adaptive, and are ready for 
your design edits.
To make copies of a harness within the same assembly, you can simply copy and paste an 
existing harness, or you click an existing harness node and drag and drop it into the graphics 
area. Then right-click, choose Make Adaptive, and follow the renaming and location options 
detailed in the earlier steps.
Creating Nailboard Drawings
Documenting harnesses is a pretty straightforward process with purpose-built tools for 
detailing harnesses as traditional nailboard drawings. To explore these options, open the fi le 
mi_18a_026.iam in the Chapter 18 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and 
follow these steps.

858 | CHAPTER 18 ROUTED SYSTEMS
 
1. Double-click the harness subassembly to set it active for edits or right-click it and 
select Edit.
 
2. Click the Nailboard button on the Cable And Harness tab.
 
3. Select a drawing template of your choice from the Open Template dialog box and click 
the OK button.
 
4. You will be taken into an active sketch within the drawing. Click the Nailboard tab to 
switch to the nailboard sketch tools.
Switching to the Nailboard Tab
To use detailing tools speciﬁ c to nailboard drawings, you must manually switch from the Sketch 
tab to the Nailboard tab once the nailboard view is created or edited. Using the Dimension tool 
on the Sketch tab will not give you the same results as using the Harness Dimension tool on the 
Nailboard tab.
 
5. Use the Harness Dimension tool to place dimensions from the points on the harness. 
These will display as driven sketch dimensions for now but will show as drawing style 
dimensions once out of sketch mode.
 
6. Click the Pivot button on the Nailboard tab and then select the sketch point at one of the 
90-degree intersections. Then click a sketch endpoint of the harness leg and drag to pivot 
the angle. Right-click and choose Finish.
 
7. Zoom to any end on the harness, and select all of the wires (you can use a selection win-
dow to do this quickly).
 
8. Once the wires are selected, the Fan In and Fan Out buttons are available on the 
Nailboard tab. Click the Fan Out button, enter 180, and then click the OK button. Note the 
change in the wire fan angle. You can window the entire harness and use the Fan In/Out 
tools to set all the fans to the same angle as well. You can also manually click and drag 
each wire if needed.
 
9. Click the Finish Sketch button when you are satisfi ed with the dimensions, leg pivots, 
and fan angles.
 
10. Click the Place Connector Views button on the Nailboard tab.
 
11. Accept the defaults and click the OK button.
 
12. Note that a drawing view of each connector is placed near each wire fan. Right-click one 
of these views and select Edit View Orientation. Notice that you can change the styl-
ing, scale, and other properties, as you would with any Inventor view, but you can also 
change the view orientation.
 
13. Feel free to experiment with view settings and then click the OK button.

16. Set Selection Filter to All Wires.
 
17. Choose Wire ID from the Property Name list and then click Apply.
 
18. Click on-screen to establish the position of the ID label to the wire, and you will see all 
the wire ID labels placed. Click the OK button. Click and drag labels to adjust them.
 
19. Expand the Segment browser node, select all the listed segments, and then right-click and 
deselect the Display As Actual Diameter option.
 
20. Expand the Wires node, right-click one of the wires, and choose View Path. Notice how 
the wire path is highlighted.
 
21. Click the Finish Sketch button.
Here are a few more settings and options to use when working with nailboard drawings:
 
◆
Right-click the top-level harness node in the browser and choose Nailboard Settings to 
adjust the global settings of the nailboard view.
 
◆
You can open a drawing template fi rst and use the Nailboard button on the Place Views tab 
to create a nailboard view and set the display settings, rotation, and other view options as 
you place the view.
 
◆
You can use the Table tool to place wire/pin tables from existing XLS fi les.
 
◆
You can use the Broken Sketch Entity tool in the drawing view sketch environment to 
break long harness runs so they will fi t on the drawing sheet.

Plastics Design Features
When creating thin wall plastic parts, you can choose either of two popular approaches to get 
started. One approach is to start with a solid and shell it out; the other is to start with a surface 
and thicken it. Although these methods approach thin wall features from different starting 
points, the end result can be the same. You can also mix and match the two methods as required 
to achieve your design.
Typically, once you’ve established the base feature, you will add other plastic part features. 
The Autodesk® Inventor® software has several specialized tools for creating plastic part features 
when you are working in the parts modeling environment. You’ll fi nd these tools on the Plastic 
Part panel of the 3D Model tab. Although many of the other tools covered in this chapter, such 
as Shell and Thicken/Offset, are used to design all types of parts, they are commonly used 
along with the plastic-specifi c tools and, therefore, are covered in this chapter as well.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to
 
◆
Create thicken/offset features
 
◆
Create shell features
 
◆
Create split features
 
◆
Create grill features
 
◆
Create rule fi llet features
 
◆
Create rest features
 
◆
Create boss features
 
◆
Create lip and groove features
 
◆
Create snap fi t features
 
◆
Create rib and web features
 
◆
Create draft features
 
◆
Create an injection mold
Creating Th icken/Oﬀ set Features
You can use the Thicken/Offset Feature to add thickness to a surface feature to create a thin 
wall solid. Although you can use this  tool to create surfaces and remove solid material, typically 
when using Thicken/Offset to create plastic thin wall features, you’ll select an existing surface 
feature to thicken and then set the output type to produce a solid.

862 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
To create a thin wall part using the thicken method, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Open on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_19a_022.ipt in the Chapter 19 direc-
tory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
If you have not already downloaded the Chapter 19 fi les from www.sybex.com/
go/|masteringinventor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the 
introduction for the download and setup instructions.
 
2. On the 3D Model tab, select the Revolve tool, and notice that Output defaults to Surface 
because the sketch is an open profi le.
 
3. For the profi le selection, click any solid line in the sketch.
 
4. For the axis, select the dashed centerline.
 
5. Leave the extents solution set to Full and click the OK button.
 
6. On the 3D Model tab, click the Combine tool fl yout menu to expose the Thicken/
Offset tool.
 
7. Switch the select mode from Face to Quilt and then select any face on the revolved surface.
 
8. Set Distance to 2 mm, and change the direction arrow so that the thickened material is 
placed to the inside of the part.
 
9. Ensure that the output is set to Solid and then click the OK button.
Notice the sharp edges. Although you could use the Fillet tool to select all the outside 
edges of the solid and then attempt to set fi llets to all the inside edges of the solid, there 
is an easier way. If you place the fi llets on the surface, the thickened solid feature will fol-
low the shape and include the fi llets. To do this, continue with these steps.
 
10. From the browser, select the end-of-part (EOP) marker and drag it above the thicken feature.
 
11. Select the Fillet tool on the Modify panel and set the radius to 8 mm.

CREATING SHELL FEATURES | 863
Using Plastic Part Templates
When working with plastic thin wall parts, it is helpful to follow certain design parameters 
throughout the features of the part to avoid issues with shrinkage and voids caused by uneven 
cooling once the part comes out of the mold. To help with this, you may want to create a plastic 
part template with your design parameters already set up. Here is an example of the parameters 
in such a template with the design rules already set up and ready for use:
Creating Shell Features
Another approach to creating thin wall features and parts is to create a solid and then use the 
Shell tool to hollow it out. When creating a shell feature, you set the wall thickness and select 
the faces you want to remove. Material from the interior of the part is removed, resulting in a 
cavity. To create a thin wall part using the shell method, open mi_19a_024.ipt in the 
Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and then follow these steps:
 
1. On the 3D Model tab, select the Revolve tool, and notice that Output defaults to 
Solid because the sketch is closed. The profi le and axis selections will automatically 
select because there is only one possible solution for each.
 
2. Leave the extents solution set to Full and click the OK button.
 
3. Click the Shell button on the Modify panel of the 3D Model tab.
 
4. Select the circular face on the top of the revolution feature as the Remove Faces selection.
 
5. Ensure that the direction is set to Inside, set the thickness to 2 mm, and then click the OK 
button.
Notice the odd result at the opening of the part. You will fi x this by creating a boundary 
patch surface and then using the Thicken/Offset tool to recut the hole. You’ll also place 
some fi llets on the sharp outside edges.
 
6. Select the Boundary Patch tool on the Surface panel.
 
7. Click the larger-diameter edge of the center hole for the BoundaryLoop selection and 
click the OK button. This creates a surface feature you’ll use to recut the hole.
 
8. On the 3D Model tab locate the Modify panel and look for the Thicken/Offset tool (note 
you might need to look in the fl yout menu). Select the Thicken/Offset tool and click the 
boundary patch’s surface.
 
9. Set Solution to Cut, set Distance to 2 mm, and set the direction to go down into the part.
 
10. Make sure the output is set to Solid and then click the OK button.

864 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
 
11. Select the Fillet tool on the Modify panel and set the radius to 8 mm.
 
12. Select the three outside edges—two along the bottom and one along the top. Be certain 
these are the outside edges and not the inside edges; then click the OK button.
 
13. Drag the fi llet feature above the shell feature in the browser. This will allow the shell to 
follow the outside fi llets and translate them to the inside edges. If you cannot drag the fi llet 
above the shell feature, mostly likely you have inadvertently selected an inside edge. If so, 
the fi llet cannot exist before the shell because it is dependent on the edge created by the shell.
 
14. Right-click the boundary patch feature in the browser and toggle the visibility off. 
Figure 19.2 shows the revolved and shelled part.
Figure 19.2
A revolved and 
shelled part
If you were to compare the parts created by the Thicken/Offset method and the Shell 
method, you would fi nd that the two are not quite identical. The difference is in the opening 
cutout. In the shelled version, a boundary patch was used to recut the opening down into the 
part (along the y-axis). In the thickened version, the opening was left in its natural condition. 
You could use the Boundary Patch tool to clean up the opening in that case as well.
Using either method, it is also important to consider a draft angle for the walls that are in the 
direction in which a mold would be separated. Not including drafts early on can lead to a lot of 
diffi cult cleanup work in the long run, before a mold can be created. You can close this fi le with-
out saving the changes and continue to the next section, where you’ll explore the Split tool.
Reordering Shell Features
You may ﬁ nd that you’ve added a previous feature that gives an incorrect result when creating 
shell features later in the design. Often, you can just click the shell feature and drag it above 
the other features to let it rebuild. To explore this, you can open the ﬁ le mi_19a_064.ipt in 
the Chapter 19 folder, click Shell1 in the browser, and drag it above Extrusion2. When you do 
so, you’ll see that the resulting part is quite diﬀ erent from when the shell was created after the 
extrusion and ﬁ llet features.
Creating Split Features
Often when designing plastic parts, it is useful to create mating parts within the same fi le. To do 
this, you can use the Split tool to divide a single body into two mating bodies. You can also use 
the Split tool to split the surfaces on a solid so that they can be manipulated individually. To see 

CREATING SPLIT FEATURES | 865
how the Split tool is used, open the fi le mi_19a_026.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and then follow these steps:
 
1. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, and notice that there is currently only a 
single solid listed in the folder. You will use the Split tool to divide this into two separate 
solids.
 
2. On the 3D Model tab’s Modify panel, select the Split tool (look in the fl yout menu under 
the Thicken/Offset or Combine tool).
 
3. For the Split tool selection, click the sketch profi le running through the part.
 
4. For the method, click the Split Solid button (third from the top), which will split the exist-
ing part into two separate solids.
 
5. Click the OK button and notice that Solid1 has been replaced with two new solids in the 
Solid Bodies folder.
 
6. To work with just the top solid, select it in the Solid Bodies folder of the browser, right-
click, and choose Hide Others.
 
7. Next, you’ll create a 3D sketch to split the surface of the solid. Use the Sketch drop-down 
on the 3D Model tab and select Start 3D Sketch.
 
8. On the 3D Sketch tab, select the Silhouette Curve tool, choose the solid as the Body selec-
tion and the visible y-axis as the Direction selection, and then click the OK button.
 
9. This creates a sketch curve along the face where a beam of light shining down from above 
would create a shadow. Click Finish Sketch to exit the 3D sketch.
 
10. Select the Split tool again and choose the 3D Sketch curve for the Split tool selection.
 
11. For the Face selection, choose the face that the 3D Sketch curve is encircling. Ensure that 
the Faces option is set to Select and not All. This will split just the outside face of the part, 
whereas All would split both the outside and inside faces. Click the OK button.
 
12. Now select the Thicken/Offset tool, choose the bottom half of the face you just split, and 
set Distance to 1 mm.
 
13. Ensure that Output is set to Solid, Solution is set to Join, and Direction is thickening out 
from the part; then click the OK button.
 
14. Right-click the thickened part you just created in the browser and choose Properties.
 
15. Set Feature Appearance to Blue – Glazing or something similar and click the OK button.
 
16. Right-click the solid in the Solid Bodies folder and choose Properties. Enter Cover 
for the name. Click the Update button to set the general properties of this solid. You’ll 
notice also that you can set the color for the entire solid body here. Selecting the Clear 
All Overrides check box would reset the blue thicken feature to abide by the color of the 
entire solid. Feel free to choose a color of your liking and then click the OK button.
 
17. Right-click the solid in the Solid Bodies folder and choose Show All to turn the visibil-
ity of the other solid back on.
There are a number of uses for a multi-body part, but for this type of product they are invalu-
able. You can close this fi le without saving the changes and continue to the next section, where 
you’ll learn to create grill features.

866 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
Turn on the Plastic Parts Tool Panel
If you do not see the Plastic Part tool panel on your 3D Model tab, you might need to enable it by 
right-clicking anywhere on the tab and then choosing Show Panels and then Plastic Part. Once 
this is done, you will see the Plastic Part panel on the 3D Model tab.
Creating Grill Features
You can use the Grill tool to create vents and openings on thin wall parts to provide access and 
airfl ow to parts housed within an exterior part. To create grill features, use the Grill tool to proj-
ect 2D sketches onto the surface of the part to create various raised or recessed features. Although 
the boundary sketch is the only required grill element, you can create islands, ribs, and spars, 
and then give them all a draft angle. You can also check the fl ow area of the opening to ensure 
that it meets the required area. Open the fi le mi_19a_028.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of 
your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and then follow these steps to create a grill feature:
 
1. Select the Grill tool from the Plastic Part panel of the 3D Model tab. You’ll see a sketch 
with all the various elements of what will become the grill within it. Figure 19.3 shows 
the sketch elements separated out into the grill elements.
 
2. For the Boundary profi le, select the outer profi le of the sketch, as identifi ed in Figure 19.3. 
Set Thickness to 2 mm, Height to 6 mm, and Outside Height to 2 mm, as shown in

Feel free to edit the grill feature and experiment with the options, adding a draft angle and 
so on. You might want to drag the EOP marker above the pattern feature before doing so to 
allow the edits to take place more quickly. Then just drag it back down once the edits are com-
plete. When you’ve fi nished, you can close this fi le without saving the changes and move on to 
the next section, where you’ll learn about rule fi llet features.

868 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
Creating Rule Fillet Features
With rule fi llets, you can create fi llets based on a list of rules you’ve set up to determine which 
edges to fi llet. This approach can be a powerful time-saver when you’re working with plastic 
parts because it allows you to create many fi llets all at once without having to select each and 
every edge. When a part feature is changed with signifi cance to the rule-based fi llets, the rule 
is evaluated to determine whether it still applies. If so, the fi llets are regenerated for new edges 
that fi t the rule and discarded for edges that do not. Although the Rule Fillet tool is categorized 
as a plastic feature tool, you can use rule-based fi llets for any part you design.
Open the fi le mi_19a_030.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and then follow these steps to create a rule fi llet feature:
 
1. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, right-click the solid named Cover, and 
choose Hide Others.
 
2. Select the Rule Fillet tool on the Plastic Part panel.
 
3. Click the drop-down under the Source column and select Face.
 
4. Rotate the part around and select the underside face of the grill features (they’ve each 
been colored yellow for easy identifi cation).
 
5. Set the Radius to 2 mm and then set the drop-down in the Rule column to Incident Edges.
 
6. In the Options area, deselect the All Rounds check box, leaving All Fillets selected.
 
7. In the Incident Edges area, select the visible y-axis as the Direction selection and then 
click the OK button to create all the previewed fi llets. Figure 19.8 shows the results of the 
rule fi llet on one of the grill faces.
Figure 19.8
An example of 
rule ﬁ llets
You’ll notice that the edges, where one of the spars meets the grill boundary along the top, 
did not receive fi llets. This is because those edges do not qualify according to the rule of inci-
dent edges. Although it might seem as if the rule fi llet has malfunctioned, close inspection 
of the grill feature will show there is a small gap between the spar and the boundary face. To 
resolve this, the lines in the grill sketch used for the spars would need to be extended past the 
boundary edge. If you edit Sketch3, you can see where the issue is.
Here are brief descriptions of the results of the Rule Fillet tool when Faces is selected:
Incident Edges  Only edges contacting the source faces that are parallel to a selected axis 
(within a specifi ed tolerance) are fi lleted.
All Edges  Edges generated by the selected faces and other faces of the part body are fi lleted.
Against Features  Two selection sets are created: a “source” selection and a “scope” selec-
tion. Only edges formed by the intersection of the faces in the source with features in the 
scope selections are fi lleted.

CREATING REST FEATURES | 869
Here are brief descriptions of the results of the Rule Fillet tool when Features is selected:
All Edges  Edges generated by the selected features and the part body are fi lleted.
Against Part  Only edges formed by the intersection of the faces of the feature(s) and the 
faces of the part body are fi lleted.
Against Features  Two selection sets are created: a “source” selection and a “scope” selec-

Free Edges  Only edges formed by faces of the selected feature are fi lleted.
When you have fi nished with this part, you can close the fi le without saving changes and 
move on to the next topic: rest features.
Creating Rest Features
A rest feature is a shelf or landing area applied to a curved or slanted face of a plastic part, 
often used as a surface on which to mount other components. The results of the rest feature are 
largely dependent on the orientation of the rest sketch in relation to the target body and the 
combination of settings and selections you choose. The Through All option will extend the rest 
profi le through the extents of the target body, and the direction arrow will change the results, as 
you can see by comparing Figure 19.9 and Figure 19.10.

You can also set the rest to terminate using a selected surface. Figure 19.12 shows a rest set to 
use the target body surface as a termination, with the direction set to go up from the sketch. The 
result adds material but does not create a pocket.
Figure 19.12
A rest using a sur-
face termination
You can use the More tab in the Rest dialog box to set Landing options such as taper angles 
and termination settings. Open the fi le mi_19a_032.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and then follow these steps to create a rest feature:
 
1. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, right-click the solid named Cover, and 
choose Hide Others.
 
2. On the Plastic Part panel, select the Rest tool. Because only one profi le is available in the 
visible sketch, it is selected automatically.
 
3. Set the direction arrow to point up (use the fl ip arrow on the left).
 
4. Set the thickness to 2 mm and set the thickness direction to Outside.
 
5. Click the More tab, set the Landing Options drop-down to To Surface, and then select the 
visible surface. Set the landing taper to 12 deg and then click the OK button.
 
6. Turn off the visibility of the landing surface and inspect the results. You’ll notice that the 
surface contours are translated to the tapered faces. If this is not the result you want, you 
can use the Delete Face option to clean up the contours.
 
7. On the Modify panel, click the small black arrow to expose the fl yout menu and then 
select the Delete Face tool.
 
8. Select the Heal check box. Then select the four contoured faces, as shown in Figure 19.13, 
and click the OK button.
Figure 19.13
Deleting and heal-
ing faces
The Delete Face tool is a good way to clean up geometry when needed, but it should not be 
used indiscriminately, because it may create unpredictable results during feature edits. If you 
have the option to edit an existing sketch or feature to get the same result as using the Delete 
Face tool, then that is typically the best option.
There are also times when cleaning up geometry can be bypassed by using a different tech-
nique. Rather than cleaning up an interior corner to apply an edge fi llet, you may be able to 
apply a two-face fi llet and have the fi llet feature “absorb” the inconsistent faces that would be 

CREATING BOSS FEATURES | 871
patched over. Also, it is a good idea to create small selection sets to delete multiple faces rather 
than trying to delete them all at once. For example, in this design you would need to delete 
the contours on the sides of the rest feature on all the inside and outside faces to remove the 
contours completely. This would be best to do as several different features, each created with 
the Delete Face tool. Once you’ve experimented with the Delete Face tool, you can close this fi le 
without saving changes and continue to the next section, where you’ll learn about boss features.
Creating Boss Features
To hold plastic parts together without risking damage to the thin wall features, boss features 
are often used to provide a more rigid connection point than just a simple hole. You can use the 
Boss tool in Inventor to create matched pairs of bosses on mating parts. The half accepting the 
fastener is the head, and the other half is the thread. You can create both types of bosses using 
the Boss tool. When required, you can add strength ribs so that the boss features will not be 
snapped off under load. As a rule, you should consider adding ribs when the length of the boss 
exceeds the diameter by more than three times.
Open the fi le mi_19a_034.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and then follow these steps to create boss features:
 
1. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, right-click the solid named Base, and 
choose Hide Others.
 
2. Because the Base part has an uneven edge, the boss features to be created will be differ-
ent heights. To locate the bosses, you will fi rst create work points. Select the Point tool on 
the Work Features panel.
 
3. To create a work point, select the edge of Work Plane4 and then select the inside edge of 
the base near the intersection of the work plane and the edge.
Repeat Command for Work Features
When you start any of the work feature tools (Work Planes, Work Axis, and Work Point), you can 
right-click and choose Repeat Command to set the work feature tools to stay on until you right-
click and choose Done. Th is helps when you are creating a lot of work features because you do not 
have to click the button each time.
 
4. Repeat this for Work Plane5 and the inside edge of the part. You’ll note that the work 
points are placed at different heights from the bottom of the base part. Figure 19.14 shows 
the resulting work points.

5. Next, you will create grounded work points to establish the inset location for the boss 
features. Use the drop-down on the Work Features panel to select the Grounded Point tool.
 
6. Select the fi rst work point you created at the intersection of the part edge and Work 
Plane4. You will see the 3D Move/Rotate dialog box, and the triad will appear at the work 
point location.
 
7. Click the Redefi ne Alignment Or Position button in the dialog box.
 
8. Next, select the small plane on the triad running between the green y-axis and the red 
x-axis (you might need to rotate your view). Then select the edge of Work Plane4. The 
triad will realign to the work plane.
 
9. Now you are ready to place the grounded work point. To do so, fi rst click the red cone 
shape (arrowhead) of the triad for the x-axis. This will isolate x-axis input in the dialog 
box. Enter 15 mm and click Apply. This will create a grounded work point.
 
10. Next, click the Redefi ne Alignment or Position button to redefi ne the triad location. Click 
the black/purple ball at the center of the triad fi rst, and then select the work point at the 
intersection of the Work Plane5 and the inside edge of the part.
 
11. Click the blue cone shape (arrowhead) of the triad for the z-axis. This will isolate the 
z-axis input in the dialog box. Enter -15 mm (or just click and drag the blue arrowhead 
into position). Then click the OK button. This will create a second grounded work point 
and exit the Grounded WorkPoint tool.
 
12. Now you are ready to create the boss features. Select the Boss tool on the Plastic Part panel.
 
13. Make sure the Placement drop-down is set to On Point and then select the two grounded 
work points for the Centers selection. Click the visible y-axis for the Direction selection, 
and ensure that the preview shows the bosses extending down toward the part base. If 
they do not, use the Flip arrow to change the direction.
 
14. Click the Head tab. Note the buttons on the left of the dialog box. If you click the lower 
one, the Head tab becomes the Thread tab, allowing you to place a different boss type. 
In the Head tab, click the (+) plus button next to the Draft Options area to view the draft 
inputs available. You can leave the inputs at the defaults.
 
15. Click the Ribs tab and select the Stiffening Ribs check box to set these options active. 
Enter 4 in the Number Of Stiffening Ribs input box.
 
16. Enter 6 mm for the Shoulder Radius input and then click the (+) plus button next to the 
Fillet Options area to view the fi llet inputs available. Leave the inputs at the defaults.
 
17. Click the Start Direction button at the bottom of the dialog box and then select either 
Work Plane4 or Work Plane5 to establish the direction. (You can also just enter 45 degrees 
as the angle, in this particular case.)
 
18. Click the OK button to create the boss features. You’ll notice that each is created at a 
different height.
 
19. Use the Mirror tool to mirror the boss feature, using the YZ origin plane as the mirror 
plane. Figure 19.15 shows the completed bosses.
Now that the Base half of this design has the head-boss features completed, you can create

Turning Off Work Feature Visibility
Recall that it is a best practice to right-click and toggle oﬀ  the visibility of each work feature you 
create once you have ﬁ nished using it. Leaving the visibility on or using the Object Visibility display 
override at the part level can make managing work features diﬃ  cult at the assembly level.
Creating Lip and Groove Features
Lip and groove features are used to mate two parts together so that they fi t together precisely. 
You can use the Lip tool in Inventor to create either the lip or the groove of the part by specify-
ing a path consisting of a set of tangent, continuous boundary edges. You can also use work 
planes to establish path extents where a lip is not needed around an entire edge. Open the fi le 
mi_19a_036.ipt from the Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and 
then follow these steps to create lip features:
 
1. Expand the Solid Bodies folder in the browser, right-click the solid named Base, and 
choose Hide Others.
 
2. Select the Lip tool on the Plastic Part panel and set the type to Lip by clicking the Lip 
button on the left side of the dialog box.
 
3. Select the inside edge along the top of the part for the Path Edges selection and then 
select the top face for the Guide Face setting.

8. Next click the Groove tab, set the outside angle to 10 degrees and the clearance to 0.5 mm 
and then click the OK button.
Note that if you did not set a clearance value, you would likely get an error. The clearance 
value is useful for creating a planar surface along the path where needed. You can experiment 
with different settings and values by editing the lip features if you would like, and then you can 
close the fi le without saving changes.
Creating Snap Fit Features
Snap-fi t features are used to secure a plastic part to another part. Although you can model any 
number of snap-fi t connections using the standard modeling tools, Inventor includes a tool to 
create the common hook-and-loop cantilever snap fi t. Figure 19.17 shows a few common snap fi ts 
you might create with the Snap Fit tool and standard modeling tools.
Figure 19.17

CREATING SNAP FIT FEATURES | 875
 
7. When the tool body component (in this case the derived part) is combined with the base 
part, its visibility is automatically toggled off. Expand the Solid Bodies folder, and 
you’ll see the derived part listed as a solid with its visibility turned off.
 
8. Next, you’ll create a work point to set the location of the snap fi t feature. Select the Point 
tool on the Work Features panel and zoom into the yellow face located on the cutout of 
the cover. Select the midpoint along the top edge of the yellow face to set the work point.
 
9. Now you’re ready to create the snap fi t. Select the Snap Fit tool on the Plastic Part panel.
 
10. Ensure that the Placement drop-down is set to On Point and the Cantilever Snap Fit Hook 
button is selected (on the left of the dialog box).
 
11. For the Centers selection, click the work point you created.
 
12. For the Direction selection, click the visible y-axis.
 
13. For the Hook Direction selection, click the derived work axis running through the 
yellow face.
 
14. Use the Flip button to set the direction correctly if the preview shows it facing down.
 
15. Ensure that the Extend check box is selected so that the snap will match the contour 
of the curved face on which it is being created. The Extend check box might make the 
 preview of the snap fi t feature look as if the feature is going to build to the wrong side 
of the yellow face, but it should be correct if you’ve followed the previous steps.
 
16. Click the Beam tab, set the Beam Length setting to 7 mm, the Beam Width At Hook set-
ting to 9 mm, and the Beam Width At Wall setting to 10 mm.
 
17. Click the Hook tab, and take a look at the settings; leave these settings at the defaults, and 
then click the OK button.
 
18. Use the Circular Pattern tool to pattern the hook around the opening for a total of three.
 
19. On the Solid bodies tab, right-click all of the solids, and choose Show All. Investigate 
the snap fi t, and note that the derived part has the mating half of the hook built in. 
Figure 19.18 shows the completed snap fi t feature.

A snap ﬁ t feature
You can turn on the derived solid from the Solid Bodies folder to check to see how the snap 
feature fi ts with the derived part. Once you’re done, you can close the fi le without saving changes.

876 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
For more on snap fi t features, you can open the fi le named mi_19a_040.ipt in the 
Chapter 19 folder to experiment with the various snap fi t settings. Use the work points to 
place hook and loop features to your liking. You can also open mi_19a_042.ipt for comparison. 
This fi le contains two halves of a simple plastic box. Examine the model features to see how the 
hook and loops were created in combination with extrude features to get a precise placement.
Working with Multi-bodies
At any point during your design, you can save the solids within a multi-body part as individual 
parts and even have them automatically placed into an assembly by using the Make Components 
tool. Creating multiple solid bodies in a single-part ﬁ le oﬀ ers some unique advantages compared 
to the traditional methods of creating parts in the context of an assembly ﬁ le. You explored the 
steps for doing this in Chapter 5, “Advanced Modeling Techniques.”
Creating Rib and Web Features
Ribs and webs are often used in plastic parts to prevent warping and to add stiffness to thin 
wall parts. To create a rib feature, fi rst create an open profi le sketch to defi ne the cross section. 
Then defi ne the direction and thickness. If the rib feature runs perpendicular to the sketch 
plane, you can add a draft taper. By default, the profi le extends to intersect the next face. To cre-
ate a rib network, you can select multiple sketch profi les at once. Alternatively, you can create a 
single rib feature and then pattern and/or mirror it.
Open the fi le mi_19a_044.ipt in the Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and then follow these steps to create rib features:
 
1. You’ll notice there is a small diagonal line sketched in the corner of the part. This will be 
the sketch profi le of the fi rst rib feature. Select the Rib tool on the Create panel (located in 
the fl yout menu under the Sweep tool), and the sketch profi le will be selected automatically.
 
2. Select Rib Type from the two buttons on the left side of the dialog box to switch the type 
of rib being created.
Normal To Sketch Plane  Extrudes geometry normal to the sketch plane. The thickness 
is parallel to the sketch plane.
Parallel To Sketch Plane  Extrudes geometry parallel to the sketch plane. The thickness 
is normal to the sketch plane.
 
3. Use the direction buttons if needed to ensure that the rib is going from the sketch toward 
the bottom corner of the part.
 
4. Set the thickness to 1 mm and use the arrows to adjust the direction in which the thick-
ness is applied. In this case, you want to use the Midplane option.
 
5. Click the OK button, and notice how the rib extends to the profi le.
 
6. Next, right-click Sketch3 in the browser and choose Visibility to make it available for use.
 
7. Select the Rib tool again, make sure the Normal To Sketch Plane option button on the left 
of the dialog box is selected, and select the four lines and the ellipse as profi les.
 
8. Toggle the Extend Profi le check box off and on to notice the difference in the preview. 
Ensure that this check box is selected so that the profi les do extend.

9. Set the thickness to 1 mm and use the arrows to adjust the direction in which the thick-
ness is applied. In this case, you want to use the Midplane option.
 
10. To explore the Finite option, click the Finite button and type 3 mm. This holds the depth 
of the ribs to 3 mm rather than allowing them to automatically terminate at the base. Set 
this option back to use the To Next option.
 
11. Click the Draft tab and enter 5 deg in the Taper input. Ensure that the Hold Thickness 
option is set to At Root.
At Top  Holds the specifi ed thickness at the sketch plane.
At Root  Holds the specifi ed thickness at the intersection of the rib feature and the ter-
minating face.
 
12. Click the Boss tab and make sure the Select All check box is selected. You will see bosses 
added at the locations of the four center points found in the sketch. You can use the 
Centers button to add or remove bosses as needed.
 
13. Set Diameter to 4.
 
14. Set Offset to 3.
 
15. Enter 12 for Draft Angle and then click the OK button to create the webbed rib and bosses 
feature.
To complete the part, you can use the Mirror tool and the XZ origin plane to copy the fi rst rib 
to the opposite side of the part. Once it’s mirrored, you can use the Rectangular Pattern tool to pat-
tern the mirror feature 10 mm toward the end of the part. Finally, use the Mirror tool and the YZ 
origin plane to add four identical ribs to the opposite end of the part. Now if you make a change to 
the original rib feature, the copies will update as well. Figure 19.19 shows the fi nished example.
Figure 19.19

Creating Draft Features
Taper or draft often needs to be applied to part faces so the part can be extracted from the mold 
in which it is manufactured. You can create draft features in three ways:
Fixed Edge  This method works by selecting a pull direction and then selecting the faces/
edges on which to apply the draft.
Fixed Plane  This method works by selecting a fi xed face and applying drafts to the faces 
intersecting it.
Parting Line  This method works by selecting a sketch to defi ne the parting line where the 
top and bottom halves of a mold form would meet.

878 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
To explore the Fixed Edge and Fixed Plane methods, open the fi le mi_19a_046.ipt in the 
Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and then follow these steps to 
create draft features:
 
1. Select the Draft tool on the Modify tab (located in the fl yout menu under the Shell tool).
 
2. For the Pull Direction selection, click the yellow base face.
 
3. To select the faces, you will click the green faces near the edge that contacts the yellow 
base face. If you move your mouse pointer over the faces before selecting them, you will 
see that the edge closest to your mouse pointer will be selected. If you accidentally select 
an extra or errant edge, you can press the Ctrl key and deselect it.
 
4. Enter 5 deg for the Draft Angle and then click the OK button. You’ll notice the top faces of 
the thin walls have been reduced because of the draft taper. To remedy this, you’ll place a 
draft on the outside faces also.
 
5. Rotate the part around so you can see the red and blue faces and then click the Draft tool 
again.
 
6. This time, click the Fixed Plane button on the left of the dialog box.
 
7. Select the red face for the Fixed Plane selection and ensure that the arrow is pointing out.
 
8. Select the blue faces for the Faces selection, enter 5 deg for the Draft Angle, and then click 
the OK button.
You can close this fi le without saving changes and then open the fi le mi_19a_048.ipt in the 
Chapter 19 folder to compare how creating the same tapers is made easier by the inclusion of 
the corner fi llet.
Draft Analysis
You can analyze your part for proper draft using the Draft Analysis tool found on the Inspect tab. 
Th is tool allows you to specify a pull direction and a draft taper to check against. If faces are found 
to be insuﬃ  cient, they are shown by color variations correlating to departure from the speciﬁ ed 
draft. Th is can be particularly helpful for complex corners and areas of a part where drafted faces 
are blended together.
Once they are created, draft analyses are saved in the browser in a folder called Analysis. You can 
create multiple analyses and turn them on by double-clicking them. To turn existing analyses oﬀ , 
simply right-click the Analysis folder and choose Analysis Visibility.
To explore the fi nal method of creating draft features, open the fi le mi_19a_050.ipt from the 
Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder; then follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Draft tool on the Modify tab.
 
2. Click the Parting Line button on the left of the dialog box.
 
3. For the Pull Direction selection, click the yellow face of the part.
 
4. For the Parting Line selection, click the projected loop that encircles the part.
 
5. For the Faces selection, choose an outer face of the part.
 
6. Click the Asymmetric button so that you have two separate draft angle inputs.
 
7. Enter 3 for the fi rst angle and 6 for the second angle and then click the OK button to 
create the draft feature.

CREATING DRAFT FEATURES | 879
As you can see, creating a draft using the parting line option is quite simple. Creating the 
sketch to use as a parting line is generally done by using the Project Cut Edges option when work-
ing with a 2D sketch or by using the Include Geometry tool or the Intersection Curve tool when 
working with a 3D sketch. You can open the fi le mi_19a_052.ipt from the Chapter 19 folder to 
explore an example of the parting line created from an extruded surface and a 3D intersection 
curve created in a 3D sketch. Figure 19.20 shows a parting line used to create a draft feature.
Figure 19.20
Draft using a 
parting line
Plastic Parts and Cooling Shrinkage
Designing plastic parts of uniform wall thickness is typically a fairly easy task when the part 
consists of a simple shell. However, when bosses and ribs are introduced, the resulting tees and 
feature intersections can create cross-section thicknesses that are signiﬁ cantly thicker than the 
wall thickness average. As is often the case when modeling 3D parts, there is nothing to tell you 
that the model will not work in the real world other than knowledge and experience. For Autodesk® 
Inventor® Professional users, the Tooling functions that allow mold design include calculations for 
material shrinkage based on the material properties.
Th e issue with adding bosses and ribs arises when the part is cooling after the molding process. 
Uneven part thickness will often result in sinking and deformation where the thicker walls cool 
more slowly than the rest of the part. Th e result can bear a very disappointing resemblance to the 
eye-catching design you intended to create.
To deal with these problem areas, you can do one or more of the following:
 
◆
You can use a textured surface to disguise uneven cooling.
 
◆
You can create cores, corner reliefs, and tee inset features to eliminate thick areas.
 
◆
You can use foam- or gas-assisted molding processes.
 
◆
You can redesign the problem areas to avoid thickened walls.
Although it will certainly vary depending on the materials and process, a rule of thumb is to keep 
tee walls at 60 percent of the standard part wall thickness. As shown here, the feature on the left has 
some obvious problems with areas that exceed a consistent thickness. Th e feature on the right has 
been designed to perform the same function and yet maintain a desirable wall thickness throughout.

880 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
Mold Design Overview
The process of mold design is a complex combination of advanced science and knowledge of an 
individual producer’s equipment and processes, and for the highest quality, it often requires a 
great deal of experience. Too often it isn’t possible to access that experience, and with many com-
panies having their plastic parts injection-molded outside of their own walls, it isn’t reasonable 
to expect to have the thorough understanding of the equipment available. Securing the time and 
expertise of a plastics engineer helps to overcome these issues, but their time is expensive and in 
very high demand. As with the stress analysis tools, Inventor includes tools to help an engineer 
with a lower degree of expertise do a lot of the fundamental analysis to make the best use of an 
expert’s time.
Inventor Tooling
Inventor Professional is an upgrade to the standard Inventor package and includes the Inventor 
Tooling functions used for plastic part analysis and injection mold design. This environment 
allows you to predict how a mold will fi ll and what defects might occur in the part. You can 
review defects such as weld lines and air pockets to decide whether you want to change gate 
placement or modify the part being manufactured.
The software includes data for more than 7,000 types of resin so you can select the appropri-
ate material for the part. This material information affects the quality and fi ll analysis settings. 
The process is fairly straightforward, and the interface allows you to move from step to step 
easily and walks you through most of the tools in order.
The process of creating the mold guides you toward a standard component that will accom-
plish your unique design requirement. This is done in a specialized tooling environment. Each 
type of component is listed in the browser as an element of the design rather than just a compo-
nent in the assembly; placing an element may affect several others. The power is in the fact that 
the user doesn’t have to specify these interactions.
If you are using Inventor Professional, you can take a look at some of the tools used in the 
workfl ow to create a mold using the Tooling features. These will be the fi rst tools you will use in 
the exercises to explore designing a mold. These exercises are just an introduction to the Tooling 
toolset. Inventor has several great built-in tutorials to augment this chapter if you want to look 
at some of the advanced features. The intent here is to get you started and introduce the possi-
bilities. Here is a list of the major steps in working with the Inventor Tooling toolset:
Plastic Part  To create a new mold, this is the starting point. This tool will convert an exist-
ing part into a mold design element. Everything else will be built around this part.
Place Core And Cavity  If you have an existing Core and Cavity set, you can import it and 
use it as the basis for the mold design.
Adjust Orientation  To properly align the mold components, an opening direction must be 
established. This orientation can be altered by setting axis directions or rotating the part.
Select Material  To properly adjust for shrinkage and to load temperature properties for 
simulation, you must select the material the component will be made of.
There are a few tools that you can select in different stages depending on your preference. 
For example, you can place a sketch to defi ne your runner before or after the core and cavity 
have been calculated. These tools are as follows:
Manual Sketch  This tool is a fl yout option under the Auto Runner Sketch tool. It can also 
be used to create a runner sketch, but it is used to sketch complex cooling line routes as well.

MOLD DESIGN OVERVIEW | 881
Runner  Many of the standard runner shapes can be applied to the core, cavity, or both sides 
of the mold. These shapes have additional options such as applying a cold slug to the end of 
the runner.
Gate  Like the Runner, the Gate has a selection of the common gate types. You can enter 
values to modify their size to suit.
Importing a Plastic Part
You will now start the process of defi ning the plastic part and the material that will drop out of 
the mold in the context of the mold design:
 
1. In the New File dialog box, click the Metric node in the left pane and then select the Mold 
Design (mm).iam template.
 
2. Give the new design the name Mastering Inventor Tooling.
 
3. Click the Browse button to specify the save location for the fi les that will be generated for 
this mold design.
 
4. Select the Chapter 19 directory and then create a new folder called MI_Tooling_054.
 
5. Select this folder and click Save to return to the previous dialog box.
 
6. Check the fi lename and fi le location path and click the OK button to create the mold 
assembly fi le.
Two new tabs have been added to the ribbon: Mold Layout and Mold Assembly. Keep in 
mind that you may need to manually switch tabs to access certain tools at different times, 
depending on the tasks and the order in which you work. Other tabs will be created dur-
ing the mold design process as well. Next, you’ll import a plastic part to work with.
 
7. Click the Plastic Part button in the Mold Layout tab and select the fi le mi_19a_054.
ipt. Then click Open to import the fi le, right-click and make sure the Align With Part 
Centroid option is selected, and then select Finish.
 
8. Select the Adjust Orientation tool from the Mold Layout panel. The preview of the 
Opening Direction will appear. Using the Flip button in the dialog box, fl ip the Z direc-
tion of the part so your preview looks like Figure 19.21.
 
9. Click the OK button when the direction has been properly set.
 
10. Click the Select Material button from the Mold Layout panel and change the manufac-
turer to BASF and the Trade Name to Terluran GP-22; then click the OK button.

882 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES

ing direction
 
11. Rotate the model so you can see the bottom of the part.
 
12. On the Runners And Channels panel, click the fl yout under the Auto Runner Sketch 
button and select the Manual Sketch button.
 
13. In the resulting dialog box, ensure that the Runner Sketch option is selected and select 
the bottommost face on the part, as shown in Figure 19.22. Click the OK button to create 
the sketch.
Figure 19.22
Creating a runner 
sketch
 
14. Use the Project Geometry tool to project the x-axis (in the Origin folder) and the leftmost 
edge of the part into your sketch; then draw a line segment along the x-axis 13 mm long 
and 6 mm from the left edge of the part, as shown in Figure 19.23.
 
15. When the line is complete, right-click and choose Finish 2D Sketch; then right-click again 
and choose Finish Edit to return to the Mold Layout tools.
 
16. Save your work, and you will notice that a number of components are being created. Note 
too that these fi les are being saved in the mold design directory you created.
In this case you’ve created the runner sketch before creating and calculating the core and 
cavity. Although you are not required to work in this order, it can help to visualize how the 

MOLD DESIGN OVERVIEW | 883
runner and gate material will appear attached to the part when it drops from the mold. This is 
the approach you will take for the next exercises. You can close the fi le you have open and con-
tinue on to explore the creation of runners and gates.
Figure 19.23
Dimensioning the

Creating Runners and Gates
Now you will place the runner and gate. To continue, open the fi le mi_19a_056.iam from the 
Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. This fi le picks up where you 
left off in the previous exercise:
 
1. On the Runners And Channels panel, click the Runner button to open the Create Runner 
dialog box.
 
2. Set Section Type to U Shape.
 
3. Use the radio button to set the runner to be created on the cavity side.
 
4. Set the radius to 3 mm.
 
5. Select the 13 mm sketched line for the path selection. Be sure to select it on the end far-
thest from the part. Selecting the line toward the other end creates the runner turned 
in the opposite direction. If you select the wrong end, just hold the Ctrl key and click it 
again to deselect it; then try again.
 
6. For Segment1, set the Cold Slug Length to 4 mm.
 
7. Check your settings against Figure 19.24 and then click the OK button to create the runner.
Figure 19.24

runner

884 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
If you expand the Runner node in the browser, you will see your runner and runner 
sketch listed. You can double-click or right-click them to edit if changes are required. 
Next, you’ll get ready to add a gate.
 
8. In the Runners And Channels panel, click the Gate Location button.
 
9. Select the bottom-left edge of the part. This is the edge with a sketch line running along it 
from the runner sketch. You can also use the ViewCube to verify the edge location where 
the left and bottom views intersect.
 
10. A ratio will appear in the dialog box. Set this to 0.5, meaning the gate will be placed half-
way along the length of the edge. The preview should show an X at the intersection of the 
runner sketch lines.
 
11. Click Apply to create the gate location and then click Done to close the dialog box.
Now you will add the gate. There are a lot of options, so this will take several steps.
 
12. Click the Gate button to open the Create Gate dialog box.
 
13. Ensure that Type is set to Edge and then set the Up/Down radio button to Up.
 
14. Set Placement to Two Points. Inventor will start looking for the gate location.
 
15. Select the work point that displays the gate location you previously defi ned.
 
16. Once the work point is selected, Inventor will want the endpoint. Select the end of the 
runner sketch nearest to the part (this correlates to the 6 mm offset dimension).
 
17. In the dialog box, set the value of W1 to 22.
 
18. Set H1 to 12.
 
19. Set W2 to 15.
 
20. Set H2 to 6 and compare your inputs to Figure 19.25.
 
21. Click the OK button to create the gate when everything appears correct.
In the previous steps, you explored the creation of runner and gate features. Although these 
features have many variations, the basic selections and steps to create them are the same. You 
can close the current fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section, where you 
will explore core and cavity design.

MOLD DESIGN OVERVIEW | 885
Analyzing and Creating Cores and Cavities
Now that you have defi ned your part’s material and how you want the plastic to fl ow into the 
mold, the next step is to begin defi ning the mold itself. Keep in mind that all of the geometry 
you’ve been working on so far will become a void in the components you are about to create.
The tools needed to determine whether the part will fi ll properly and to establish the geom-
etry of the core and cavity are more automated than other tools in Inventor. These tools will also 
inform you if you have missed a step in the process. Here is a brief overview of some of them:
Part Process Settings  Optimal values for the mold temperature and pressures are loaded 
from the material information. This dialog box allows you to make modifi cations to accom-
modate your equipment if need be.
Part Fill Analysis  Inventor Tooling has the ability to analyze the fi ll time, quality, and other 
important considerations regarding where weld lines may appear or air traps may occur.
Defi ne Workpiece Setting  Establishing the size of the tool from which your core and cavity 
will be cut is an important step. You must accommodate the runner and eventually the com-
ponents of the assembly that move the material to the cavity.
Create Runoff Surface  A runoff surface can be seen as an extension of the parting line. It is 
the surface that will be used to divide the workpiece so the parts of the mold can separate.
Generate Core And Cavity  This tool launches you into another environment that is 
focused on how the workpiece will be modifi ed to create the void for the plastic to fi ll.
To continue, open the fi le mi_19a_057.iam from the Chapter 19 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. This fi le picks up where you left off in the previous exercise. 
To create the core, cavity, and other components, you will fi rst need to change the environment 
in which you are working:
 
1. On the Mold Layout panel, click the Core And Cavity button. This brings up the Core/
Cavity tab, which gives you access to the tools needed to create the workpiece that will be 
added to the mold base to complete the design.
 
2. Select the Gate Location button on the Plastic Part panel to place the gate in the  workpiece. 
Note that these steps will be the same as those you followed in the previous exercise.
 
3. Select the bottom-left edge of the part near the visible work point.
 
4. Set the ratio to 0.5 to place the gate halfway along the length of the edge.
 
5. Click the Apply button to create the gate location and then click Yes when warned about 
the existing analysis results. Then click Done to close the dialog box.
 
6. Select the Part Process Settings button from the Plastic Part panel. Review the settings 
and then click the OK button to accept the default and close the dialog box.
 
7. Select the Part Fill Analysis button from the Plastic Part panel. Understand that this 
analysis may take some time to run, so if you prefer, you can just click Close and skip this 
step. If you’d like to run an analysis yourself, click Start and then click the OK button in 
the message box letting you know that the analysis is running.
 
8. When the analysis is complete, a summary showing the results will appear. If you skipped 
the previous step, you can view a previously prepared results  summary. To do so, expand 
the node for mi_19a_054 in the browser and then expand the Results node and then the 
Fill node. Click the Summary node to bring up the results summary.
In Figure 19.26, you can see that the part can be fi lled, but there is concern about the 
 quality obtained from the current setup.

in blue and the cavity in green.
 
18. Drag the Body Separation slider to the right and back to show how the parts will separate.
 
19. Click the OK button to generate the two parts.
On occasion, the runner and gate information created beforehand does not update with 
the generation of the core and cavity. Select the Mold Update tool from the Quick Access 
bar to bring this data up into the cavity side of the workpiece.
 
20. Click the Finish Core/Cavity button at the end of the ribbon to return to the Mold Layout 
tools and compare your work to Figure 19.30. You can close this fi le without saving 
changes and continue to the next section.

Working with Mold Bases
Now that the workpiece is complete, you can focus on generating the rest of the mold. These 
tools are located on the Mold Assembly tab. The tools in this tab are focused on the tools needed 
by manufacturing to generate the part effi ciently. Inventor Tooling contains tens of thousands 
of parts for mold bases, as defi ned by the manufacturers. This works like a design accelerator to 
keep you from specifying something that will be a custom order or an inaccurate component. In 
the following exercise, you will focus on creating a mold base.
You will now build the entire mold base in just a few steps with minimal input and effort. 
This is a great example of how the functional design approach can work for you. To get started, 
open the fi le mi_19a_059.iam from the Chapter 19 directory of your Mastering Inventor 
2015 folder and then follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to the Mold Assembly tab on the ribbon.
 
2. Click the Mold Base button in the Mold Assembly panel to open the Mold Base dialog box.
 
3. The Mold Base dialog box allows you to select from a huge library of standard mold 
base designs and to select options within those base designs. The following steps use 
items from the Content Center Mold database. To ensure that you can access these fi les, 
check your project and make sure the libraries are loaded. You can do so by selecting the 
Projects button on the Get Started tab, clicking the Confi gure Content Center Libraries 
button (in the lower-right corner), and selecting the Inventor Mold libraries.
 
4. From the Vendor And Type drop-down, select the DME; then click the Query button and 
select the type E base. Note that if you have previously selected the Immediately Query 
check box, you will not need to click the Query button.
 
5. Set the size to 346 mm × 346 mm.
 
6. Expand the dialog box by clicking the double-arrow icons on the top- or bottom-right 
edge of the dialog box.
 
7. Expanding the dialog box will show the list of components included in the mold base.
 
8. Select the part labeled E 400 346X346X76.
 
9. Once the part is selected, several buttons appear for that row. Select the button with the 
ellipsis (three dots; the tool tip will say Property Settings). This will launch a dialog box 
for changing options (if any exist).
 
10. Click the H_value and change it in the drop-down list from 76 mm to 56 mm, as shown in 
Figure 19.31.

MOLD DESIGN OVERVIEW | 889
 
11. Click the OK button to close the dialog box. Inventor will update the E400 plate’s descrip-
tion and the preview in the dialog box.
 
12. Click the Placement Reference button and select the bottom point in the front-left corner 
of the workpiece (use the ViewCube for reference to fi nd the left and front sides).
 
13. You will see a preview outline of where the mold base will be positioned around the 
workpiece. Make sure the workpiece appears inside the rectangle.
 
14. Once you’ve verifi ed that the workpiece appears inside the rectangle, click the OK button 
in the dialog box to generate the mold base.
 
15. If the Mold Update button becomes visible in the Quick Access bar, click it and compare 
your work to Figure 19.32.
You may not have been expecting the entire mold base to be generated, but since the compo-
nents are purchased, it makes sense to place them as a unit as they would be assembled. You can 
close this fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.

Working with Ejectors and Sprue Bushings
You will now complete one last series of steps to see the fi nal critical details of placing ejectors 
and the sprue bushing:
Ejector  Accessing the library of standard ejector pins is only part of this tool. It will make it 
easy for you to properly align the pins based on the center of the component, using a coordi-
nate system that is used by the toolmakers.
Sprue Bushing  This tool places the standard sprue bushing based on the location of the 
runner, simplifying the process of placement and improving the quality.
To get started, open the fi le mi_19a_059.iam from the Chapter 19 directory of your 
Mastering Inventor 2015 folder. Then follow these steps:
 
1. On the Mold Assembly tab, select the Ejector button.
Doing so clears the screen of everything but the original part and runoff surface. It also 
opens the Ejector dialog box, which contains standard ejector pins and their optional sizes.
 
2. Leaving the options at the default, click the plastic part to place four ejectors. You can 
choose four approximate locations between the pairs of ribs, as shown in Figure 19.33.

Placing the 
ejectors
 
3. Click the >> button in the dialog box and set the values to 33 mm or −33 mm for the X 
column and 17 mm or −17 mm for the Y column.
The order in which you placed your ejectors might cause your positive or negative values 
to differ, but entering the inputs as shown will give you the correct result.
 
4. Set the diameter (d1 value) to 2 mm and the length (L value) to 100 mm and then click the 
OK button to place the ejectors in the mold.
Placing the ejector will cause Inventor to make clearance cuts in other plates and cut the 
length or even the contour of the ejector to prepare all of the components in the mold base. 
Select any of the pins in the browser to show how they terminate at the core face of the mold.
Next, you’ll place a sprue bushing and a locking ring.
 
5. On the Mold Assembly tab, click the Sprue Bushing button. It will be looking for a point 
from which to locate.
 
6. Select the visible sketch center point at the end of the runner sketch farthest from the part.
 
7. Set Type to DME AGN.
 
8. Set the length (L value) in the dialog box to 76 mm using the drop-down.
 
9. For an offset value, enter −14 mm.
 
10. Click the OK button to place the bushing and cut the clearance geometry in the 
relevant parts.
 
11. Select Sprue Bushing in the Design window.
 
12. Right-click and select Open from the context menu.
 
13. Rotate the part to see how the runner geometry has been cut from the bushing, as shown 
in Figure 19.34.
Figure 19.34
Th e runner geom-
etry is cut into the 
sprue bushing

THE BOTTOM LINE | 891
 
14. To return to the assembly, close the Sprue Bushing part and do not save changes.
 
15. Click the Locating Ring button from the Mold Assembly panel.
 
16. Set the type to Rabourdin 646-Type B and choose the top of the base face (green plate).
 
17. Set the D2 value to 32 mm and the A_ value to 22.5 mm and then set the offset value 
to −22.5 mm.
 
18. Click the OK button to place the ring into the assembly.
The fi nished base should look like Figure 19.35.

Through use of functional design techniques, the most tedious steps of designing a mold 
are eliminated or greatly simplifi ed. You can close this fi le without saving changes, explore the 
Inventor Tooling tools with your own design, and take advantage of just how easy it is to create 
a complex mold design.
You can also fi nd additional mold and tooling tutorials built right into Inventor by clicking 
the Tutorials button on the Get Started tab.
Th e Bottom Line
Create thicken/offset features.  When creating plastic parts, you will often fi nd that work-
ing with surfaces allows you to achieve more free-form shapes than working with solids. 
Once the surfaces are created, you’ll need to give them a thin wall thickness.
Master It  How would you create a plastic part fi le with many curved, free-form elements?
Create shell features.  Shelling solids parts and features is a common way to create base 
features for plastic parts. Once the shell feature is created, other features can be added to it.
Master It  You want to create a shell feature but need to have some faces be thicker than 
the rest. How would you accomplish this?
Create split features.  Many times you may want to establish the overall shape of a feature 
and then divide the shape into separate parts of the overall design. You can use the Split tool 
to do just that and more.
Master It  You have a plastic part that needs to have a raised face for a rubber grip ap-
plied during the manufacturing process. How would this be done?

892 | CHAPTER 19 PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES
Create grill features.  Grill features allow the infl ow or outfl ow of air through a plastic 
thin-wall part. Grills can be created with a number of subfeatures such as islands, ribs, and 
spars, but only the outer profi le of the grill is required.
Master It  How would you determine the area of a grill opening based on the airfl ow it 
needs to handle?
Create rule fi llet features.  Rule fi llets can be an extremely effi cient way to apply fi llets 
throughout the design to many edges that meet the same rule criteria.
Master It  How would you apply fi llets to all of the edges that are generated by extrud-
ing a shape down to an existing set of base features?
Create rest features.  Rest features can be used to create level platform faces for mounting 
other parts to an irregular plastic part face.
Master It  You want to create a rectangular pocket on the inside of a plastic housing to 
hold an electronic component. How would you do this?
Create boss features.  Boss features are ideal for creating fastener-mounting standoffs for 
thin-wall plastic parts. You can use the Boss tool to create both halves of the fastener boss.
Master It  You want to create multiple boss features around the perimeter of a fl at, pan-
type base part, but you know this base part is likely to change size. How would you set 
up the boss features to adjust to the anticipated edits?
Create lip and groove features.  When designing plastic parts, you may need one half of a 
design to fi t into the other half. The Lip tool allows you to create both lip and groove features 
for these situations.
Master It  You want to create a groove around the edge of an irregular, curved edge. 
How can you ensure that the lip on the corresponding part will match?
Create snap fi t features.  Snap features are a common way to join plastic parts together so 
that they can be disassembled as needed. You can use the Snap Fit tool in Inventor to quickly 
create these features.
Master It  How would you create a U-shaped snap fi t with the Snap Fit tool?
Create rib and web features.  Ribs and webs are often used to add rigidity and prevent 
warping during the design of plastic parts. You can add ribs based on open profi le sketches 
in Inventor.
Master It  How would you create a network of ribs that are evenly spaced, with some of 
them containing different cutouts than others?
Create draft features.  Because plastic parts must be extracted from a mold during the 
manufacturing process, drafted faces must be included to ensure that the parts can indeed be 
extracted from the mold.
Master It  You want to create drafted faces on a complex part containing various shapes 
within it. How would you do this?
Create an injection mold.  To generate the components you have designed with the plastic 
part features, you need to properly defi ne the cavity to create the part and defi ne how the 
material will fl ow into the cavity.
Master It   You want to create a mold base design in an effi cient manner using parts that 
can be purchased. 

Chapter 20
iLogic
In this chapter, you will explore the use of iLogic to confi gure your models with intelligence and 
automation. iLogic is often used to speed up tedious design tasks, to enforce consistency across 
designs, and to allow the logic of programming to make design decisions based on predeter-
mined design rules. Although this chapter focuses primarily on using iLogic in the parts envi-
ronments, the fundamentals you’ll learn will apply to the assembly and drawing environments 
as well.
In this chapter, you’ll learn to

What Is iLogic?
iLogic is a programming add-in that is included with the Autodesk® Inventor® software. It 
extends and enhances the design capabilities and allows you to automate tedious design tasks. 
By creating custom iLogic code, you can add higher levels of design intelligence to your models. 
Using the iLogic tools, you can create simple, rule-based logic to set and drive parameters and 
properties in your designs. iLogic rules can be embedded directly into individual Inventor fi les, 
or they can be saved externally where they can be accessed by all of your Inventor fi les. iLogic 
uses custom parameter types to allow you to customize more than just the numeric data avail-
able with standard Inventor model parameters. These types include Text parameters, True/False 
parameters, and multi-value list parameters.

894 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
To understand how iLogic works, you need to think in terms of design rules. Most design 
departments already have certain design rules they follow when creating parts and assemblies. 
For instance, suppose a design requires a minimum hole spacing to ensure a strong connection. 
If a part length causes the spacing to exceed the minimum hole spacing, then another hole is 
added.
Currently, you might follow these rules manually as you design, but with the use of iLogic, 
you can add the rules to the model fi le so that the design rules are implemented automatically. 
You can even have rules trigger other rules so that a cascade of decisions is made based on 
initial input from the user.
Understanding iLogic Rules
An iLogic rule can be thought of as a small Visual Basic .NET “program” created and used to 
monitor and control Inventor objects such as parameters, features, and components. A rule can 
determine and/or set design parameters within your model. This allows you to control the 
values of the model automatically, based on conditions and inputs.
For example, you might have a product line offered to your customer in standard cataloged 
sizes, with standard features included or excluded based on the size and application. But you 
also offer this same design in custom sizes when needed. With traditional Inventor tools, you 
would determine whether the requested size is standard, and if it is not, you would create a new 
custom-size component to fi t the need. Once the size is determined, you would decide to include 
or exclude features per your design guidelines and then include other features based on the spe-
cifi c application of this custom design.
Because the process of confi guring your product line relies on your experience and memory, 
it might be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly if you need to have another Inventor 
user, with less experience with your product, create the design. You can use iLogic to set up a 
collection of rules in a template fi le. The fi rst rule might allow you to input the requested size 
using a customized dialog form. Another rule would determine whether the requested size is 
an existing standard size or a new custom one. If it is a custom size, a part number and descrip-
tion are automatically generated to honor your standard nomenclature. Yet another rule would 
then determine whether standard features are included or excluded based on the size (for exam-
ple, if the hole spacing exceeds X, add another hole). And fi nally, another rule might be invoked 
to add application-specifi c features (for example, add left-hand switch mounting holes, if the 
custom design is for a left-hand application).
What Are Functions?
A function is an instruction created and used within a rule to modify the Inventor model or read 
some data from the fi le. When a rule is run, the functions within it are executed. The predefi ned 
iLogic functions follow VB.NET syntax and require the coding to follow the syntax to work. 
This syntax consists of the function category, function name, and function arguments.
In the previous example, where the goal was to create a collection of rules to determine a 
standard or custom size, the fi rst rule would control the dialog box to collect the input from the 
user. So, a function would be added to call an input box function and then assign the collected 
input to an Inventor parameter. Here is an example of an input box function used to prompt the 
user for a width value:
myWidth = InputBox("Please Enter A Width", "Width Input", "750")

WHAT IS ILOGIC? | 895
The resulting input box displays as shown in Figure 20.1 and creates a return value called 
myWidth, which is set to the value the user enters into the input box. In this case, the default 
value has been set to 750. So if the user were to accept the default value by clicking the OK but-
ton, myWidth would be set to 750.
Figure 20.1
A basic iLogic 
input box
You might include multiple functions in the same rule, depending on its complexity. When 
doing so, you will typically place functions in order so that information is created or gathered 
from one function and then used later by another function. Typically, each function is indepen-
dent of the remaining code in the rule.
To use the myWidth value from the previous example, you could create a second function to 
set the Inventor parameter controlling the width of the part equal to myWidth. Here, the Inventor 
parameter is a dimension in a sketch that has been named Wid1:
myWidth = InputBox("Please Enter A Width", "Width Input", "750")
Parameter("Wid1") = myWidth
There are several categories of functions provided in iLogic. You can fi nd all of the available 
functions when creating rules by expanding the function category node in the rule editing inter-
face. Here is the list of iLogic categories:
Parameter functions
Variables functions
Document functions
iFeature functions
Feature functions
Material Properties functions
Run Other functions
Assembly Constraint functions
Component functions
Sheet Metal functions
BOM functions
Measure functions
iProperties functions
Drawing functions
Math functions
Work Feature functions

Advanced API functions

896 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Working with Function Arguments and Data Types
Within functions, you can also have arguments. An argument is a value that is sent to the func-
tion when it is called. Passing an argument to a function gives the function information to work 
with. An argument can be one of the following data types:
Text  Any value specifi ed inside double quotes
Boolean  A value of True or False
Numeric  Any numeric value
Set Values with Functions
Take a look at this example to see the text string and Boolean data types in use:
Feature.IsActive("Hole1") = False
Here, the function category Feature is being used. The Feature function IsActive is 
instructed to look for the feature called Hole1, and then the False argument tells the function 
to suppress Hole1. If the Boolean were set to True, then the hole would be set active or not 
suppressed. You’ll notice Hole1 is set inside double quotes, thereby specifying it as a text string.
Next, look at this example to see numeric data in use:
Parameter("Diameter1") = 4.4
Here, the Parameter function is being told to look for the feature called Diameter1 and then 
use 4.4 as the value. In both of these examples, the function is setting a value. In addition to 
setting values, you can retrieve or get values using functions.
Get Values with Functions
In the following examples, you’ll look at how to get a value from a function. You’ll start off with 
the reciprocal function for the previous function involving Diameter1:
Current_Dia = Parameter("Diameter1")
Here, the Parameter function is being told to create a return value placeholder called 
Current_Dia and then set it to the parameter called Diameter1. Next, look at an input box 
function:
Wid1 = InputBox("Please Enter A Width", "Width Input", Wid1)
In this function, the return value happens to be an Inventor dimension parameter named 
Wid1, which is a sketch dimension defi ning the width of the part. The input box reads the Wid1 
parameter into the default value (on the far right) so that the user is presented with the current 
width and at the same time is prompted to enter a new value. When the user clicks the OK but-
ton, the input box value is written to the Inventor dimension parameter named Wid1.
Here is an example comparing the use of functions to get and set information:
iProperties.Value("Project", "Revision Number") = 2
RevNumber = iProperties.Value("Project", "Revision Number")

WHAT IS ILOGIC? | 897
In the fi rst line, the function is being given the arguments Project and Revision Number to 
specify that iProperty be set to 2. In the second line, the return value called RevNumber is being 
set to the current Revision Number iProperty for the fi le. Again, it uses the arguments Project 
and Revision Number to tell the iProperty collection which iProperty to read.
Conditional Statements
You use conditional statements to put the logic in iLogic. The conditional statements evaluate 
the present state of the model and execute logic depending upon that state. For example, if the 
hole spacing in a part exceeds a minimum value because of a change in length, then another set 
of holes is required:
Space1 = Parameter("Hole_Space")
If Space1 >= 45 Then
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = True
Else
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = False
End If
In the fi rst line, a return value parameter named Space1 is set to the model parameter called 
Hole_Space. Then, Space1 is evaluated to determine whether it is less than or equal to 45. If so, 
it is set to be active (not suppressed). Otherwise, it is suppressed. The following sections include 
examples of each of the available conditional statements.
If, Then, Else Statement
If, Then, Else is probably the most common of the conditional statements. It tests for a con-
dition and then applies one or more actions if the condition is found to be true; otherwise, it 
applies one or more other actions:
If <condition> Then
<action if true>
Else
<action if false>
End If
If, Then Statement
If, Then tests for a condition and then applies one or more actions if the condition is found to be 
true. If the condition is not true, then nothing happens.
If <condition> Then
<action if true>
End If
What Are Comments?
Text preceded by an apostrophe in iLogic is interpreted as a comment and not as code. You can 
use this to your advantage by adding notes to your iLogic code to make it easier to understand.

898 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Null Statement
A null If, Then tests for a condition and then applies no action if the condition is found to be 
true (the 'do nothing in the following statement is simply a comment and could be omitted). If 
the condition is not true, one or more actions are applied:
If <condition> Then 'do nothing
Else <action if false>
End If
Single-Line If Statement
You can use a single-line If statement when testing a simple, short condition with short true 
and false statements. Single-line If, Then tests for a condition and then applies one or more 
actions if the condition is found to be true. If the condition is not true, then nothing happens:
If <condition> Then <action if true> Else <action if false>
If, Then, ElseIf Statement
Using the If, Then, ElseIf format, you can add as many conditions as you want. Here is the 
format when three conditions are being tested. If, Then, ElseIf tests for a condition and then 
applies one or more actions if the condition is found to be true. If not true, it tests another condi-
tion, and so on. If none of the tested conditions is found to be true, it applies one or more other 
actions. If no fi nal action is specifi ed, nothing happens unless one of the conditions is found to 
be true:
If <condition 1> Then
<action if condition 1 is true>
ElseIf <condition 2> Then
<action if condition 2 is true>
ElseIf <condition 3> Then
<action if condition 3 is true>
Else
<action if none of the above conditions is true>
End If
Select Case Statement
The Select Case statement is another way to test what is inside a variable. You can use it when 
you know there are only a limited number of values that the variable could hold:
Select Case <test expression>
Case <expression list 1>
<statement list 1>
Case <expression list 2>
<statement list 2>
Case Else

UNDERSTANDING THE ILOGIC ELEMENTS AND INTERFACE | 899
<statement list n>
End Select
For instance, if a multi-value list parameter named Part_Size consisted of a list containing 
Small, Medium, and Large, you could set the test expression to Part_Size and set up three cases 
called Small, Medium, and Large, as shown here:
Select Case Part_Size
Case "Small"
Len = 50
Wid = 40
Case "Medium"
Len = 75
Wid = 65
Case "Large"
Len = 100
Wid = 90
End Select
When the Part_Size parameter is set to Small, the case named Small is selected, and the 
Len and Wid parameters are set to the values corresponding to the small size.
Understanding the iLogic Elements and Interface
There are two primary areas within Inventor used to create and manage iLogic rules: the 
Parameters editing dialog box and the iLogic browser. The Parameters dialog box is used to 
create and edit parameters to be used in iLogic, and the iLogic browser allows you to create and 
manage rules. Figure 20.2 shows the Parameters button, accessed from the Manage tab, and 
Figure 20.3 shows the iLogic Browser button, also accessed from the Manage tab.

900 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Exploring iLogic Parameter Types
Recall that Inventor has three types of parameters:
 
◆
Model parameters are created by dimensions and feature inputs.
 
◆
Reference parameters are created from driven dimensions.
 
◆
User parameters are created by you, the user.
Within the user parameter category, you can create three parameter types: the Text parameter, 
the True/False parameter, and the Numeric parameter. The Numeric parameter can be referenced 
into your Inventor model using the standard Inventor tools, but the Text and Boolean param-
eters can be used only with the iLogic tools.
To create user parameters and specify the type, you use the drop-down list in the Parameters 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 20.4.
Figure 20.4
User parameter 
types
Text Parameters
A Text parameter is any value specifi ed within double quotes. For instance, if you wanted to 
use product names in an iLogic rule to fi ll out iProperty information, you could create a Text 
parameter to contain that information. Keep in mind that you can create a Text parameter using 
numeric data by enclosing it in double quotes. For instance, Inventor will read “22 mm” as a text 
string but 22 mm as numeric data. Text parameters can be set to be multi-value list parameters 
or used as static, single-value parameters.
True/False Parameters
True/False parameters fall within the Boolean data type. They have only two states: True and 
False. A True/False parameter would be used, for example, when asking a user a question. 
Figure 20.5 shows an input box with two radio buttons. Depending on which the user chooses, a 
True/False parameter named Part_Type is toggled.

UNDERSTANDING THE ILOGIC ELEMENTS AND INTERFACE | 901
Figure 20.5
An input box used 
to toggle a True/
False parameter
Here is the iLogic rule that produces the input box and then sets the True/False parameter 
named Part_Type. The Part_Type parameter is then used to set the material iProperty of the 
part fi le:
Part_Type = InputRadioBox("Choose Manufacturing Type", "Machined", "Cast", _
Part_Type, Title:= "Select Part Type")
If Part_Type = True Then
iProperties.Material = "Aluminum-6061"
ElseIf Part_Type = False Then
iProperties.Material = "Cast Steel"
End If
Numeric Parameters
Numeric parameters are the parameters used by Inventor sketch dimensions and feature dialog 
box inputs. When you create a sketch dimension and input value, you are creating a Numeric 
parameter. You can create Numeric user parameters to hold formulas, which are then called 
into sketch dimensions, and so on. In addition to using Numeric parameters with the standard 
Inventor modeling tools, you can use them with iLogic. Numeric parameters can be set to be 
multi-value list parameters or used as static, single-value parameters.
Note that you can add unit strings to Numeric parameters and Inventor will still read them 
as numeric. For instance, Inventor will read 45 mm as numeric data. If the model length unit is 
set to millimeters, Inventor will read 45 as numeric data and assume millimeters. Recall that 
you can set the default units for any model fi le by selecting the Tools tab, clicking the Document 
Settings button, and then selecting the Units tab.
Multi-Value Lists
Text and Numeric parameters can consist of a single, static value or can be made into a multi-
value list. To create a multi-value list, follow these general steps:
 
1. On the Manage tab, click the Parameters button.
 
2. In the Parameters dialog box, choose Add Text or Add Numeric from the drop-down at 
the bottom left.
 
3. Name the Text parameter as you see fi t (recall that spaces are not allowed in parameter 
names, but you can use an underscore).

902 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
 
4. Right-click the new parameter and choose Make Multi-Value.
 
5. Enter values into the list editor to populate your list.
Figure 20.6 shows a multi-value list for product names being populated. The values on the 
bottom have already been added; the ones on the top are being entered.
Figure 20.6
Populating a multi-
value list
Once the multi-value list is populated, you can add or remove entries by right-clicking the 
parameter and choosing Edit Multi-Value List, as shown in Figure 20.7.
Figure 20.7
Editing a multi-
value list
Key Parameters
You can designate some parameters as Key parameters to aid in the placement of iLogic compo-
nents into an assembly later. For instance, if you had a part fi le with 50 parameters in it, you’d 
likely want to designate only a small number of those as key parameters. This allows you to 
choose which parameters the user can adjust during the fi le placement, and it streamlines the 
process as well. To set a parameter to be a key, click the Filter button at the lower left of the 
Parameters dialog box.

UNDERSTANDING THE ILOGIC ELEMENTS AND INTERFACE | 903
Using the iLogic Browser
The iLogic browser is the interface item used to create, edit, and manage rules and forms within 
Inventor. You can access the iLogic browser from the Manage tab by clicking the iLogic Browser 
button on the iLogic panel, as shown previously in Figure 20.3. Once it’s displayed, you will fi nd 
four tabs in the iLogic browser:
 
◆
Rules
 
◆
Forms
 
◆
Global Forms
 
◆
External Rules
The Rules Tab
The Rules tab allows you to add, edit, run, regenerate, suppress, and delete rules. When rules 
are created, they are automatically listed in the Rules tab; therefore, the Rules tab will always list 
all rules embedded in the current document.
Adding Rules
To add a new rule to an Inventor fi le, right-click anywhere in the Rules tab of the iLogic browser 
and choose Add Rule (Figure 20.8).
Figure 20.8
Choose Add Rule 
from the browser to 
begin creating an 
iLogic rule
Alternatively, you can use the Add Rule button on the iLogic panel of the Manage tab. The 
fi rst step to adding a rule is entering a name for the rule in the Rule Name input box. Once the 
name is entered, you are presented with the Edit Rule dialog box, where you can build the rule. 
You’ll explore the creation of rules in the coming pages.
Editing Rules
To edit an existing rule in an Inventor fi le, right-click the rule in the Rules tab of the iLogic 
browser and choose Edit Rule (Figure 20.9). You will be presented with the Edit Rule dialog box, 
where you can make changes to the rule. The section “Creating iLogic Rules” later in the chapter 
shows how to build rules in this dialog box.

The Forms Tab
The Forms tab allows you to add iLogic user input forms. These forms are built using the iLogic 
Form Editor, which makes creating customized user input forms remarkably easy. You’ll work 
with the Form Editor in “Creating iLogic Forms.”
Adding Forms
To add a new form to an Inventor fi le, select the Forms tab in the iLogic browser, right-click in 
the tab, and choose Add Form (Figure 20.10).
Figure 20.10
Choosing to add an 
iLogic form from 
the browser
You can also add forms by selecting the Manage tab, clicking the drop-down found on the 
iLogic panel, and then clicking the Add Form button. When using this method, you’ll have an 
option to choose whether the form is intended to be embedded in the current document or to be 
a global form used by all documents.
Editing Forms
To edit an existing form in an Inventor fi le, right-click the Form button in the Form tab and 
choose Edit (Figure 20.11).

The Global Forms Tab
The Global Forms tab lists all the rules stored outside of Inventor, independent of the actual 
Inventor fi le you are working on. Global forms can be used when you want to use the same form 
across multiple rules so that you don’t need to create the form over and over again. They also 
help promote consistency, and you can make edits to forms in multiple rules quickly and in one 
global location. To add a global form, you set the Global Forms tab to active, right-click in the 
tab, and choose Add Form (Figure 20.12).
Figure 20.12
Choosing to add a 
global iLogic form 
from the browser
You can also add global forms by selecting the Manage tab, clicking the drop-down on the 
iLogic panel, and then clicking the Add Form button. When using this method, you have an 
option to embed the form in the current document or use it as a global form in all documents.
Global forms are stored within the Design Data folder. You can fi nd the location by clicking 
the Global Forms tab and choosing Open Containing Folder (shown in Figure 20.12). Recall from 
Chapter 1, “Getting Started,” that the location of the Design Data folder can be specifi ed in two 
ways:
Application Options  On the Tools tab, click the Application Options button and then click 
the File tab. Set the Design Data path to the location of your choice. Be aware that this sets the 
location on the installation of Inventor being used to set the path. Therefore, if you work with 
other Inventor users and want to have all of the installs looking at the same Design Data 
folder, you would need to walk around to each machine and set this path or use the Project 
Settings method.
Project Settings  Close all open Inventor fi les. Ensure that no other users are accessing the 
project fi le (*.ipj) that you intend to edit. On the Get Started tab, click the Projects button. 
In the Projects editor dialog, locate the Folder Options node in the bottom pane and expand 
it. Set the Design Data path to the location of your choice. This method sets the path per the 
project fi le and therefore overrides the Application Options setting if the two do not match. If 
multiple users are using the same project, then all of them will now be using the new Design 
Data folder.
The External Rules Tab
The External Rules tab lists all the rules stored outside of Inventor, independent of the actual 
Inventor fi le you are working on. External rules can be used as iLogic rules or as small pro-
grams that are run manually (like VBA macros). To add an existing external rule, set the 
External Rules tab active, right-click in the tab, and choose Add External Rule, as shown in 
Figure 20.13.

906 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Figure 20.13
Adding an exter-
nal rule from the 
browser
When you choose Create New External Rule, you will be prompted with the Create Rule File 
dialog box, where you can browse to a location and save the rule as one of the three available 
fi le formats: plain text (*.txt), iLogic VB (*.ilogicVb), or Visual Basic (*.vb). Generally, this 
location is on a shared network where all users can access the fi les. Figure 20.14 shows a new 
external rule being created and saved in a location called iLogic Rules in the Mastering Inventor 
project path. Once the rule fi le is created, you are presented with the Edit Rule dialog box, where 
you can build the rule. External rules are often used with event triggers, such as Before Save, 
which will run the rule when the fi le is saved.
Figure 20.14
Creating an exter-
nal rule
External Rule File Save Location
You can set up default external rule ﬁ le save locations and the default ﬁ lename extension by 
selecting the Tools tab, clicking the drop-down on the Options panel, and then clicking the iLogic 
Conﬁ guration button, as shown here.

UNDERSTANDING THE ILOGIC ELEMENTS AND INTERFACE | 907
Understanding the iTrigger
An iTrigger is an Inventor user parameter that you can include in the current fi le to trigger 
rules manually. This parameter is often used to test a rule while you are creating it. The iTrigger 
parameter may not be as useful as it was before the iLogic browser made the rules more 
easily accessed.
The iTrigger button on the iLogic panel of the Manage tab initially creates a user parameter 
named iTrigger0. If the parameter already exists, the value of the iTrigger parameter is incre-
mented by 1 and triggers any rule containing the iTrigger0 parameter. If multiple rules contain 
the iTrigger, they are all triggered. Here is a rule to save the current fi le as a PDF that contains 
the iTrigger:
'set the trigger
trigger = iTrigger0
'path and file name without extension
path_and_name = ThisDoc.PathAndFileName(False)
'call the PDF addin
PDFAddIn = ThisApplication.ApplicationAddIns.ItemById_
("{0AC6FD96–2F4D-42CE-8BE0–8AEA580399E4}")
oDocument = ThisApplication.ActiveDocument
oContext = ThisApplication.TransientObjects.CreateTranslationContext
oContext.Type = IOMechanismEnum.kFileBrowseIOMechanism
oOptions = ThisApplication.TransientObjects.CreateNameValueMap
oDataMedium = ThisApplication.TransientObjects.CreateDataMedium

908 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
'set the PDF publish options
If PDFAddIn.HasSaveCopyAsOptions(oDataMedium, oContext, oOptions) Then
'oOptions.Value("All_Color_AS_Black") = 0
oOptions.Value("Remove_Line_Weights") = 1
oOptions.Value("Vector_Resolution") = 400
oOptions.Value("Sheet_Range") = Inventor.PrintRangeEnum.kPrintAllSheets
'oOptions.Value("Custom_Begin_Sheet") = 2
'oOptions.Value("Custom_End_Sheet") = 4
End If
'Set the destination file name
oDataMedium.FileName = path_and_name & ".pdf"
'Publish PDF
.Call PDFAddIn.SaveCopyAs(oDocument, oContext, oOptions, oDataMedium)
Working with Event Triggers
An event trigger is used to set up a rule to trigger automatically. For instance, you might want 
to create a rule to prompt you to fi ll out the fi le properties when you save the fi le. To do so, you 
simply add the rule to the Before Save event. The rule is triggered when you save a fi le, allowing 
you to enter or confi rm the iProperties, and then the fi le is saved. Here is a list of the available 
event triggers:
 
◆
When a new fi le is created
 
◆
After a fi le is opened
 
◆
Before a fi le is saved
 
◆
After a fi le is saved
 
◆
Before a fi le is closed
 
◆
When any model parameter is changed
 
◆
When an iProperty is changed
 
◆
When a feature of a part is suppressed or unsuppressed
 
◆
When the geometry of a part is changed
 
◆
When the material of a part is changed
 
◆
When a component of an assembly is suppressed or unsuppressed
 
◆
When a component of an iPart or iAssembly is changed
 
◆
When a drawing view is changed
To add a rule to an event trigger, select the Manage tab, and click the Event Trigger button 
on the iLogic panel. Then select the event you want to use and click the Select Rules button. You 
can then select from the available rules. Keep in mind that you will see only applicable event 

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 909
triggers in the list when setting a trigger for an event. For instance, if the current fi le you are 
working in is an IDW fi le, you will not see event triggers such as Material Change (changing the 
material of a part) in the list.
Creating iLogic Parameters, Rules, and Forms
Now that you’ve had an overview of the iLogic tools and components, you are ready to create 
iLogic parameters, rules, and forms. You’ll start by focusing on rules using input and message 
boxes and then look at creating and using iLogic forms.
Creating iLogic Rules
In the following pages, you’ll explore the methods and options of creating iLogic rules. To add 
a new rule to an Inventor fi le, you right-click the fi le node in the Rules tab of the iLogic browser 
and choose Add Rule.
Creating Your First Rule
Once a rule is created using Add Rule, you are presented with the Edit Rule dialog box. This 
dialog has four main interface panes, as shown in Figure 20.15:
Function Category List (#1)  Contains all of the iLogic function categories for easy access 
and reference.
Rule Authoring Pane (#2)  The area where you input and edit your rule code.
Tabs Area (#3)  Provides access to the Model, Options, Search And Replace, and Wizards 
tools. In Figure 20.15, the Model tab is selected. You can see that it gives you access to the 
model parameters and features for inclusion in the rule.
Subtabs (#4)  A subset of the Model tab. As displayed in Figure 20.15, the Parameters tab 
lists the model parameters because Model Parameters is selected on the left.

910 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
To see how all of this works, you can use the following steps to create a simple rule. If you 
have not already downloaded the Chapter 20 fi les from www.sybex.com/go/masteringinven-
tor2015, please refer to the “What You Will Need” section of the introduction for the download 
and setup instructions. The goal of the rule you will create in this example is to create user 
inputs to control the width and length of the plate:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_001.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. Click the Manage tab and select the iLogic Browser button on the iLogic panel to ensure 
your iLogic browser is displayed.
 
3. In the iLogic browser, ensure that the Rules tab is selected, right-click anywhere in the 
Rules tab, and choose Add Rule or click the Add Rule button on the iLogic panel of the 
Manage tab in the ribbon.
 
4. Enter Size Input into the Rule Name dialog box and then click the OK button.
 
5. In the Edit Rule dialog box, make sure the Model tab along the top is set active and then 
expand the model node (if needed) and select Model Parameters. All of the model param-
eters for this part fi le are now listed in the Parameters subtab on the right.
 
6. In the Model tab, click Extrusion1 and notice the Parameters tab now shows only the 
parameters used in Extrusion1.
 
7. In the Function Category list (on the left), locate the MessageBox node and expand it by 
clicking the plus sign.
 
8. Locate the InputBox item toward the bottom of the list and double-click it. This will place 
the generic InputBox function into your rule, thereby providing the template syntax you 
need to follow. This function should read as follows:
myparam = InputBox("Prompt", "Title", "Default Entry")
 
◆
myparam is the placeholder for the return value (the value retrieved from the 
input box).
 
◆
InputBox is the name of the function.
 
◆
"Prompt" is the placeholder for the message to appear in the box.
 
◆
"Title" is the placeholder for the text to appear in the title bar of the box.
 
◆
"Default Entry" is the placeholder for the text to display in the input fi eld of the box 
when it is fi rst opened.
Function Syntax Guide
If you look in the help ﬁ les under User’s Guide ➢ iLogic ➢ Functions and then refer to the Quick 
References tab, you can find a listing of all the functions with a guide and example of each 
one’s syntax.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 911
 
9. Select myparam in the Rule Authoring pane and then double-click Width in the 
Parameters subtab. This will replace myparam with the word Width.
Note that the color coding indicates that Width is a recognized parameter. You could have 
just deleted the word myparam and then typed in the word Width as well. If you had done 
so and accidentally typed width with no uppercase W, the word would not have turned 
blue to indicate a recognized parameter.
 
10. Delete the word Prompt and replace it with "Enter Width" (with the quotation marks).
 
11. Delete the word Title and replace it with "Width Input" (with the quotation marks).
 
12. Replace the words Default Entry with 100 mm (no quotation marks).
Your result should read as follows:
Width = InputBox("Enter Width", "Width Input", 100 mm)
 
13. Click the OK button to close the Edit Rule dialog and test the rule. You should be 
prompted with an input box that looks like the one in Figure 20.16.
Figure 20.16
Th e width input box
 
14. Enter 150 in the input box and then click the OK button.
You’ll notice that the model width did not change as you might have expected. This is because 
the input box has changed only the Width parameter, and now the fi le needs to be updated. You 
should see that the Update button is active, indicating the model needs to be updated. You can 
click the Update button to see the model width change to 150 mm. In the next section, you’ll edit 
a rule to make the model automatically update when the rule is run.
You can right-click the rule and choose Run Rule in order to test it and change the width 
value again. When you have fi nished, you can close the fi le without saving changes.
Editing Your Rule
In this exercise, you’ll pick up where you left off and edit the Size Input rule you created in the 
previous exercise:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_002.ipt in the Chapter 20 
directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the iLogic browser, locate the Size Input rule on the Rules tab and then right-click it 
and choose Edit Rule.

912 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
 
3. Place your cursor at the end of the existing function and press the Enter key on the key-
board a couple of times to provide some space in the rule.
 
4. In the Function Category list (on the left), locate the Document node and expand it by 
clicking the plus sign.
 
5. Locate the UpdateWhenDone item toward the middle of the list and double-click it. This 
will place the UpdateWhenDone function into your rule so that it looks like this:
Width = InputBox("Enter Width", "Width Input", 100 mm)
iLogicVb.UpdateWhenDone = True
 
6. Click the OK button to test the rule.
 
7. Enter 190 in the input box and click the OK button. Your part width should automatically 
change to 190 mm.
 
8. From the iLogic browser, right-click the Size Input rule and choose Edit Rule again.
Currently, your rule is coded to set the default entry of the input box to 100 mm. If you 
built this plate with a standard size of 100 mm for the width most of the time, then 
hard-coding that value might be the way to go. But often, it’s more useful to retrieve the 
current parameter value and have it display in the input so the user knows the value 
before changing it.
 
9. Replace the 100 mm with Width. You can do this by typing over the value or by selecting it 
and then clicking Extrusion1 in the Model tab along the top. Then double-click the Width 
parameter to “push” it into the Rule Authoring pane. In either case, your function should 
look like this:
Width = InputBox("Enter Width", "Width Input", Width)
 
10. Click the OK button to test the rule and notice that the current width value of the model 
is listed in the input box. Replace this with 165 and click the OK button.
To fi nish this rule, you will add another function to change the length of the part. Follow the 
steps you used to create the width function so that your rule reads as follows and then test the 
part to see how it works:
Width = InputBox("Enter Width", "Width Input", Width)
Length = InputBox("Enter Length", "Length Input", Length)
iLogicVb.UpdateWhenDone = True
You can right-click the rule and choose Run Rule in order to test it and see how it functions. 
When you have fi nished, you can close the fi le without saving changes.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 913
Creating a Rule Using a Multi-Value Parameter
In the previous exercises, you used an input box to change parameter values so that you could 
adjust the dimensions of the plate part. In this exercise, you’ll create a multi-value parameter 
and then create a rule to get the user to select from the list. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_003.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the Manage tab, click the Parameters button.
 
3. Right-click the Length parameter and choose Make Multi-Value.
 
4. In the Value List Editor dialog box, enter the following values into the top pane and then 
click Add. If 175 mm is listed in the bottom pane, select it and click Delete to remove it.
 
◆
150
 
◆
160
 
◆
170
 
◆
180
 
◆
190
 
5. Click the OK button to close the Value List Editor dialog box and then click Done to close 
the Parameters dialog box.
 
6. From the iLogic browser, ensure that the Rules tab is selected; then right-click anywhere 
in the Rules tab, and choose Add Rule.
 
7. Enter Size List Input into the Rule Name dialog box and click the OK button.
 
8. In the Edit Rule dialog box, make sure the Model tab along the top is set active and then 
expand the model node (if needed) and select Model Parameters. All of the model param-
eters for this part fi le are now listed in the Parameters subtab on the right.
 
9. In the Model tab, click Extrusion1 to show the parameters used in Extrusion1.
 
10. In the Function Category list (on the left), locate the MessageBox node and expand it by 
clicking the plus sign.
 
11. Locate the InputListBox item toward the bottom of the list and double-click it. This will 
place the generic InputListBox function into your rule, thereby providing the template 
syntax you need to follow. This function should look similar to this:
d0 = InputListBox("Prompt", MultiValue.List("d0"), d0, _
 Title:= "Title", ListName:= "List")
 
◆
d0 is the placeholder for the return value (the value retrieved from the input box).
 
◆
InputListBox is the name of the function.

914 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
 
◆
"Prompt" is the placeholder for the message to appear in the box.
 
◆
MultiValue.List("d0") is the subfunction and the name of the multi-value 
list to use.
 
◆
d0 is the placeholder for the default list value to select in the input list of the box when 
it is fi rst opened.
 
◆
The space and underscore that appear in this text break the line and allow it to wrap 
to the next line; however, you will not see this in your rule by default.
 
◆
"Title" is the placeholder for the text to appear in the title bar of the box.
 
◆
"List" is the placeholder for the text to appear above the list in the box.
 
12. Select d0 in the Rule Authoring pane and then double-click Length in the Parameters 
subtab. This will replace d0 with the word Length (no quotation marks).
When to Use Quotation Marks
Quotation marks indicate a text string. When you want the function to see your entry as a text 
string, use quotation marks. When you want the function to read a parameter (either from the 
model or from the rule), don’t use quotation marks.
 
13. Delete the word Prompt and replace it with "Select Length" (with the quotation marks).
 
14. Replace d0 in MultiValue.List("d0") with "Length" (with the quotation marks).
 
15. Replace the next instance of d0 with 150 (no quotation marks). In this case, you want the 
input box to have a hard-coded default of 150.
 
16. Delete the word Title and replace it with "Length Selector" (with the quotation 
marks).
 
17. Replace the word List with "Available Standard Lengths" (with the quotation 
marks).
 
18. To make your code more readable in the editor, add an underscore after the comma follow-
ing MultiValue.List("Length") and then press Enter on the keyboard. The underscore 
must have a space in front of it. This acts as a carriage return within the code, allowing the 
line to fi t on-screen without upsetting the syntax.
Once the edits are made, your result should read as follows:
Length = InputListBox("Select Length", MultiValue.List("Length"), _
150, Title:= "Length Selector", ListName:= "Available Standard Lengths")

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 915
 
19. Click the OK button to exit the Edit Rule dialog and run the rule.
 
20. Click the Update button to see the model update.
To fi nish this rule, you will edit the Width parameter and make it a multi-value parameter 
with the same values you used for the length. Then, edit the rule and add another input list box 
function to change the width of the part. Follow the steps you used to create the length function. 
Then, add the function to make the part update when the rule is fi nished running (recall that 
you’ll fi nd this in the Document function category list) so that your rule reads as follows:
Length = InputListBox("Select Length", MultiValue.List("Length"), _
150, Title:= "Length Selector", ListName:= "Available Standard Lengths")
Width = InputListBox("Select Width", MultiValue.List("Width"), _
150, Title:= "Width Selector", ListName:= "Available Standard Widths")
iLogicVb.UpdateWhenDone = True
Finally, test the part to see how it works. When you have fi nished, you can close the fi le with-
out saving changes.
Working with Multiple Rules in the Same File
In the next exercises, you’ll work with both of the rules you created in the previous exercises 
and then create a third rule to choose which of the other two to run. Follow these steps to work 
with multiple rules in the same fi le:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_004.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the iLogic browser, locate the Size Input rule on the Rules tab; then right-click it and 
choose Run Rule.
 
3. Enter 150 for Length and click the OK button.
 
4. Enter 150 for Width and click the OK button.
You’ll notice that the Size List Input rule is run automatically when you click the OK but-
ton, presenting you with the Length Selector list input box.
 
5. Click the OK button in both the Length Selector and Width Selector input boxes.
The issue here is caused by both rules handling the same parameters. Currently, any 
change to those parameters causes the rules to run automatically. Although this might be 
the desired result in some cases, in this instance it is causing a problem. To resolve this, 
you will edit both rules and change their options.
 
6. From the iLogic browser, locate the Size Input rule on the Rules tab; then right-click it and 
choose Edit Rule.
 
7. Along the top, select the Options tab and select the Don’t Run Automatically option, as 
shown in Figure 20.17; then click the OK button to exit the Edit Rule dialog box.

916 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Figure 20.17
Rule options
 
8. Click the OK button in the Length Input and Width Input boxes to accept the default 
values.
Next, you’ll do the same thing for the Size List Input box.
 
9. From the iLogic browser, locate the Size List Input rule on the Rules tab; then right-click it 
and choose Edit Rule.
 
10. Along the top, select the Options tab, select the Don’t Run Automatically option, and then 
click the OK button to exit the Edit Rule dialog box.
 
11. Click the OK button in the Length Selector and Width Selector boxes to accept the 
default values.
As a test to see that the issue is resolved, you can run the rules and change the width and 
length values to ensure that neither rule runs when the other makes a change. Once you’ve 
tested this, you can close the fi le without saving and continue. 
Handling Errors
Often, your rules will work ﬁ ne when you test them because you enter expected results. But you can 
rest assured that as soon as you have other people test your rules, they’ll encounter errors when 
they provide invalid input, for example.
Depending on the complexity of your code, you can often add a simple error handler to manage 
null inputs and other issues created when the user doesn’t provide predictable or desired input.
You can use a simple On Error Resume Next line to skip or ignore an error. Although this is not 
considered a good practice for programming, it will often suﬃ  ce for simple errors. For example, 
you can open the ﬁ le mi_20a_022.ipt and run Rule0. If you click the Cancel button in the input 
box, you’ll receive an error because the rule returns an empty string value. If you do the same for 
Rule1, the error is skipped because Rule1 includes an On Error Resume Next line.
Rule2 includes an On Error Goto ErrorHandler line that instructs Inventor to skip to the 
ErrorHandler line and display a message if an error is encountered. You can run Rule2 and click 
the Cancel button in the input box to see how this works. Rule3 checks for the speciﬁ c problem of 
an empty text string and provides the user with a message. Rule4 does the same but just uses the 
existing value rather than the null input.
You can search online for VB error checking to ﬁ nd many more error-checking strategies.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 917
Use a Conditional Statement to Run Another Rule
Next, your goal is to create a new rule to choose between two existing rules. But before doing so, 
you’ll add a True/False user parameter and then edit the existing rule names to make them a bit 
more meaningful for your next task:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_005.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the Manage tab, click the Parameters button.
 
3. From the lower-left corner, select the user parameter drop-down list (it shows Add 
Numeric by default).
 
4. Set it to Add True/False and then Enter Standard_Size for the parameter name.
 
5. Click Done to exit the Parameters dialog box.
Next, you’ll rename the existing rules.
 
6. From the iLogic browser, locate the Size Input rule on the Rules tab, click it once to select 
it, and then slowly click it again to set the name active for renaming.
 
7. Enter Custom Size Input for the new name.
 
8. Repeat this for the Size List Input rule and rename it Standard Size List Input.
 
9. In the iLogic browser, right-click anywhere in the Rules tab, and choose Add Rule (note 
that you can also click anywhere in the blank space of the iLogic browser with the Rules 
tab active to add a rule).
 
10. Enter Size Type Input into the Rule Name dialog box and then click the OK button.
 
11. In the Function Category list (on the left), locate the MessageBox node and expand it by 
clicking the plus sign.
 
12. Locate the InputRadioBox item toward the bottom of the list and double-click it. This will 
place the generic InputRadioBox function into your rule, thereby providing the template 
syntax you need to follow. This function should read as follows:
booleanParam = InputRadioBox("Prompt", "Button1 Label", "Button2 Label", 
booleanParam, Title:= "Title")
 
◆
booleanParam is the placeholder for the return value (the value retrieved from the 
input box).
 
◆
InputRadioBox is the name of the function.
 
◆
"Prompt" is the placeholder for the message to appear in the box.
 
◆
"Button1 Label" and "Button2 Label" are the labels for the radio buttons.
 
◆
booleanParam is the placeholder for the default radio button to select when the input 
box is fi rst opened.
 
◆
"Title" is the placeholder for the text to appear in the title bar of the box.

13. Make sure the Model tab along the top is set active and then expand the model node (if 
needed) and select User Parameters. All of the user parameters for this part fi le are now 
listed in the Parameters subtab on the right. In this case, there is just the one you created.
 
14. Select booleanParam in the Rule Authoring pane and then double-click Standard_Size in 
the Parameters subtab. This will replace booleanParam with Standard_Size (no quota-
tion marks).
 
15. Delete the word Prompt and replace it with "Select Size Type" (with the 
quotation marks).
 
16. Replace Button1Label with "Standard Sizes" (with the quotation marks).
 
17. Replace Button2Label with "Custom Size" (with the quotation marks).
 
18. Replace booleanParam with True (no quotation marks). This sets the default to be true, 
which will be the fi rst button, or the standard size option.
 
19. Delete the second instance of the word Title and replace it with "Standard or Custom" 
(with the quotation marks).
 
20. To make your code more readable in the editor, add an underscore after the comma fol-
lowing "Select Size Type" and then press Enter on the keyboard. The underscore must 
have space in front of it. This acts as a carriage return within the code, allowing the line 
to fi t on-screen without upsetting the syntax.
Once the edits are made, your result should read as follows:
Standard_Size = InputRadioBox("Select Size Type", _
"Standard Sizes", "Custom Size", True, Title:= "Standard or Custom")
Currently, this rule doesn’t do anything other than display an input box to let you choose 
between two buttons. To make those buttons do something meaningful, you will add a 
conditional statement to run one of the other existing rules.
 
21. From the toolbar along the top of the Rule Authoring pane, select the If…Then…End If 
button to place the syntax snippet in your rule.
 
22. Delete the My_Expression placeholder and leave your cursor between If and Then.
 
23. Right-click Standard_Size in the Parameters subtab and choose Capture Current State. 
This should result in Standard_Size = True unless you made changes to the True/False 
parameter when creating it. If so, just edit it to read Standard_Size = True.
 
24. In the Function Category list (on the left), locate the Run Other node and expand it by 
clicking the plus sign. Locate the RunRule item in the list.
 
25. In the Rule Authoring pane, place your cursor on the line after Then and above End If 
and double-click the RunRule node in the Function Category list. This will place the 
iLogicVb.RunRule("ruleName") function into your rule.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 919
 
26. Replace ruleName with "Standard Size List Input" (with the quotation marks).
 
27. Add an empty line above End If and enter Else, hit Enter on the keyboard and add 
another RunRule function, and replace Replace ruleName with "Custom Size Input" 
(with the quotation marks).
Your resulting rule should read as follows:
Standard_Size = InputRadioBox("Select Size Type", _
"Standard Sizes", "Custom Size", True, Title:= "Standard or Custom")
If Standard_Size = True Then
iLogicVb.RunRule("Standard Size List Input")
Else
iLogicVb.RunRule("Custom Size Input")
End If
Figure 20.18 shows the input radio dialog box.
Figure 20.18
Th e radio buttons 
allow you to run 
one rule or the 
other.
You can test this rule and notice that you can now choose between the two input types, 
Custom and Standard. If you choose Custom, you can add anything, and you can choose from 
only the approved standards for the standard inputs.
But what if you enter a value such as 300 for the length? You’ll notice that the hole spacing 
becomes quite large. It would be nice to have a rule to add holes for large custom lengths and 
widths. In the next exercise, you’ll investigate how to do just that.
Use a Message Box to Troubleshoot
Oftentimes, it is helpful to add a message box to return a value to you so you can see what the code 
is returning. Th is is particularly helpful when your code is throwing an error. For example, if, when 
working with a parameter named Shell_OD, you receive an error concerning that parameter, you 
might temporarily add the following line to visually conﬁ rm the value returned for Shell_OD:
MessageBox.Show(Shell_OD, "Test")

920 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Suppressing Features
In this next exercise, two hole features have been added to the part for you. The goal is to create 
a rule to suppress a hole feature if the spacing is under a specifi ed distance and activate it if the 
spacing exceeds the specifi ed distance. You’ll explore a couple of other tips and tricks along the 
way. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_006.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the Manage tab, click the Parameters button.
 
3. Notice that there are two reference parameters present.
These reference parameters were created in Sketch3, which controls the locations of Hole2 
and Hole3. Recall that a reference parameter is created by adding a driven dimension to 
a sketch. In this case, the distance between the center holes and end holes along the hori-
zontal and vertical edges was dimensioned after the sketch was fully constrained, result-
ing in the driven dimension/reference parameter. Then, those parameters were renamed.
 
4. On the Rules tab of the iLogic browser, click and drag the rule named Size Type Input 
to the top of the list. Since this is the rule that is utilized to choose between the others, it 
might be best to place it at the top.
 
5. Add a new rule and call it Suppress Center Holes.
 
6. From the toolbar along the top of the Rule Authoring pane, select the If…Then…End If 
button to place the syntax snippet in your rule.
 
7. Use the drop-down and add Else to the snippet so that you have the following:
If My_Expression Then
Else
End If
 
8. Highlight My_Expression in the function code and then look in the Model tab along the 
top and select Reference Parameters.
 
9. Select Center_Hole_Space_H from the Parameters subtab on the right and double-click it 
to replace My_Expression.
 
10. From the toolbar along the top of the Rule Authoring pane, select the Operators drop-
down and notice that it contains a list of all the logic operators. Click >= to include it in 
your rule after Center_Hole_Space_H and then enter 45 so that the result is as follows:
If Center_Hole_Space_H >= 45 Then
On the next line, you will add the function to make the hole feature active.
 
11. Select Hole2 from the feature tree in the Model tab area and then right-click it and choose 
Capture Current State.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 921
Capture Current State
You can use the Capture Current State option on any Inventor feature or parameter. You can just 
delete the unneeded information and keep what is pertinent.
 
12. Delete all the extra information and keep only the Feature.IsActive line. IsActive can 
be used to suppress or not suppress any Inventor feature that can be suppressed.
 
13. Copy that line below the Else and change True to False so the result reads as follows:
If Center_Hole_Space_H >= 45 Then
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = True
Else
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = False
End If
 
14. Copy your entire block of code and paste it under the original.
 
15. Change the reference parameter to Center_Hole_Space_V and the hole feature references 
to Hole3 so your entire rule reads as follows:
If Center_Hole_Space_H >= 45 Then
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = True
Else
Feature.IsActive("Hole2") = False
End If
If Center_Hole_Space_V  >= 45 Then
Feature.IsActive("Hole3") = True
Else
Feature.IsActive("Hole3") = False
End If
 
16. Click the OK button to test the rule.
Because the current hole spacing is less than 45 for both of the reference parameters, the 
hole is suppressed. Next, you’ll modify the existing rules to call the Suppress Center 
Holes rule and format the Custom Size Input rule to include a “soft” warning in the form 
of a second line in the input boxes.
 
17. Edit the Standard Size List Input rule and add the following line to the very end (after the 
UpdateWhenDone function):
iLogicVb.RunRule("Suppress Center Holes")
Of course, you can just type the line in as you are reading it, but for the sake of practice, 
use the Function Category list to fi nd the RunRule function and double-click it to enter it.

922 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
 
18. Edit the Custom Size Input rule and add the same RunRule line to the end.
 
19. Change the top two lines of code to read as follows:
Length = InputBox("Enter Length " & vbCrLf & _
"(max length not to exceed 350)", " Length Input", Length)
Width = InputBox("Enter Width " & vbCrLf & _
"(max width not to exceed 300)", " Width Input", Width)
Inserting & vbCrLf & creates a second line in the input line. The underscore preceded 
by a space provides a carriage return without disrupting the code. This makes it easier 
to read in the Edit Rule dialog box. When you test the rule, you’ll see that that the second 
line contains a parenthetical statement advising the user of the maximum width. This is 
a “soft” warning because there is nothing in the rule to prevent the user from inputting 
values larger than the stated maximums.
Because your rules are changing the size of your part, it would be nice to add a bit of code 
to adjust the zoom level to match the size of the new part. To do so, you can call an appli-
cation programming interface (API) object to make this happen with this line:
ThisApplication.ActiveView.Fit
 
20. Edit the rule named Size Type Input and add the previous line to the end.
 
21. Add a comment line above it by typing This line Zooms All.
 
22. To make that line be seen as a comment and not a line of code, simply add an apostrophe 
to the beginning. The result should be as follows:
'This Line Zooms All
ThisApplication.ActiveView.Fit
Commenting Code
Any text preceded by an apostrophe is read by iLogic as a comment and not interpreted as code. 
Use this to your advantage by adding notes and documentation to your iLogic code to make editing 
it in the future easier.
You can also use the Comment and Uncomment buttons found on the toolbar above the top of the 
Rule Authoring pane to comment out entire blocks of code and then uncomment them later. Th is is 
particularly helpful when troubleshooting and working out “what if” strategies while creating rules.
If you anticipate using a particular snippet a lot, you might want to save it to the Custom 
Snippets tab. To see how this is done, you’ll save the Zoom All snippet.
 
23. Highlight both the comment line and the code line and then right-click and choose 
Capture Snippet.
 
24. For the Title, type Zoom All.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 923
 
25. Click the Use Code As Tooltip button and then click the OK button.
 
26. Click the Save Custom Snippets button on the toolbar of the Custom Snippets tab and 
choose a name and location for your custom snippet fi le.
You’re likely beginning to see the power of iLogic and the use of simple rules to create con-
fi gurations of your model templates. Feel free to experiment with this fi le to tweak the code as 
you like, or you can close the fi le without saving changes and move on to the next section.
Operators
You’ll fi nd the use of operators to be a common method of building logic in your iLogic rules. 
An operator performs a function on one or more objects. Table 20.1 lists some common operators 
and examples of their uses for quick reference.

Creating iLogic Forms
iLogic forms are used to create a custom user input and control form to work with iLogic rules 
or to handle parameter and iProperty changes directly. iLogic forms are created with an intui-
tive drag-and-drop interface that is easy to master.
Working with iProperties and Forms
In this next exercise, you’ll explore the use of iProperties in iLogic rules and then create a basic 
iLogic form to manipulate them. The objective here is to create a rule to do the following:
 
◆
Read the available materials from the part fi le and populate a multi-value parameter list 
with those values.
 
◆
Set the material iProperty using the list box selection.
 
◆
Ask the user a question: Is this part to be painted?
 
◆
Set the part color iProperty based on the user input.
Follow these steps to explore the use of iProperties and forms:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_007.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. From the Manage tab, select the Parameters button.
Table 20.1: 
Common function operators   (continued)

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 925
 
3. Add a new Text user parameter (use the drop-down in the lower-left corner) and call it 
Materials_List.
 
4. Right-click the new parameter and choose Make Multi-Value.
 
5. Add a new value called Generic to the list.
 
6. Create another new Text user parameter and call it Colors_List.
 
7. Make it a multi-value parameter also and add the following values (make sure your spell-
ing and capitalization match exactly):
 
◆
As Material
 
◆
Gunmetal
 
◆
Slate
 
◆
Tan
 
◆
White
 
8. Close the Parameter dialog and open the iLogic browser. Add a rule named Material and 
Color Input.
 
9. Locate and expand the iProperties node in the Function Category list on the left.
 
10. Find the List Of Materials entry and double-click it to add it to your rule.
 
11. Clear param from between the parentheses and then select User Parameter from the 
model tree list at the top.
 
12. Double-click Materials_List in the Parameters subtab on the right to place it in the quo-
tation marks. Your rule should read as follows so far:
MultiValue.List("Materials_List") = iProperties.Materials
This line retrieves the current list of materials from the part fi le and uses it to populate 
the Materials_List parameter you created. Next, you’ll add a line to set the material 
iProperty to be whatever the value of the Materials_List parameter is. And then, you’ll 
do the same for the Colors_List parameter.
 
13. From the iProperties node in the Function Category list on the left, select Material and 
double-click it to add it to your rule.
 
14. Add an equal sign to the end of the line and then ensure that User Parameter is still 
selected in the model tree list at the top. Double-click Materials_List in the Parameters 
subtab to add it to the code.
 
15. Do the same thing for the iProperty function called PartColor and the user parameter 
called Colors_List so that your fi nal rule code reads as follows:
MultiValue.List("Materials_List") = iProperties.Materials
iProperties.Material = Materials_List
iProperties.PartColor = Colors_List
 
16. Click the OK button to exit the Edit Rule dialog box.

926 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Next, you’ll build an iLogic form to allow you to easily select a material and a color from 
a list.
 
17. In the iLogic browser, switch to the Forms tab and then right-click in the browser space 
and choose Add Form.
The Form Editor opens and shows the form building tools, as illustrated in Figure 20.19.

tabs for All, Key, and Renamed
Tabs Area (B)  Allows you to drag and drop items from the list to the Form Design pane 
to add controls for your custom interface
Form Design Pane (C)  Allows you to design a custom interface by doing the following:
 
◆
Dragging and dropping parameters, rules, iProperties, and Toolbox items onto 
the form
 
◆
Dragging and dropping items on the tree to organize the controls
 
◆
Editing label text
 
◆
Selecting an item to edit its properties in the Properties area
Toolbox (D)  Allows you to drag and drop controls onto your form

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 927
Properties Area (E)  Allows you to edit the properties for the items selected in the Form 
Design pane
 
18. In the Form Design pane (see area C in Figure 20.19), you will see the name of the form 
listed as Form 1. Change this to read Material and Color Form.
 
19. Use the Parameters tab in the top-left pane and select the Materials_List parameter. 
Then, click and drag it up to the top-right pane and drop it under the form name.
 
20. Notice that an input box is added to the preview form on the right.
 
21. In the Form Design pane, edit the Materials_List entry to read Select a Material, 
and then adjust the size of the preview form as needed.
 
22. Drag the Colors_List parameter to the Form Design pane. Add it above the material 
control by dragging either item to reorder them.
 
23. Rename Colors_List to read Select a Color.
 
24. Click the Colors_List control in the Form Design pane and then locate and expand the 
Behavior item in the Properties area at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
25. Set Edit Control Type to Radio Group, as shown in Figure 20.20.

trol type
 
26. Click the OK button to close the Form Editor and then click the Material And Color Form 
button to bring up the form. Figure 20.21 shows the fi nished form.

Figure 20.21
Th e ﬁ nished 
Material And 
Color Form
Play around with the controls, adjusting the material and color to your liking. Recall that set-
ting a color overrides the material color, and therefore, you’ll need to set the color to As Material 
to see the change of material have any effect on-screen. When you’ve fi nished, you can close this 
fi le without saving changes and continue to the next section.
Form Properties
You can set various options for the form such as the font and color by selecting the node for the 
form itself in the Form Design pane and then using the Properties area options. Th e Visual Style 
property provides a list of color schemes for the form.
By default, the form includes a Done button, but you can select from the Predeﬁ ned Buttons 
list. If you’re using the OK Cancel or OK Cancel Apply button options, the changes to the model 
do not take place until a button is clicked. If you’re using the default Done button, changes are 
applied automatically.
Building a Part Configuration Form
In the next exercise, you’ll build an iLogic Form for use in confi guring a small plate part. This 
part is a cast part that needs to be machined to include several features. The specifi cations of 
those features vary depending on the application, so it would be ideal to set up a template part 
with an iLogic form to allow quick and consistent confi guration of the plate as needed. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_008.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. Click the Manage tab and select the iLogic Browser button from the iLogic panel to make 
sure your iLogic browser is displayed.
On the Rules tab, you’ll see three existing rules. Each rule checks a reference parameter 
found in Sketch6 used to create the sweep feature called Gasket Groove. If a specifi ed 
reference parameter falls below a set minimum, a warning message is displayed.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 929
 
3. Set the Forms tab of the iLogic browser active and then right-click the iLogic browser and 
choose Add Form.
 
4. Change the Form label from Form 1 to Confi gure Plate.
 
5. Locate the Parameters tab on the left and click the plus sign to expand the list of param-
eters (if it’s not already expanded). Notice that the list of parameters includes model, ref-
erence, and user parameters.
 
6. Find the parameter named Mount_Dia and then click and drag it into the Form Design 
pane on the right. Drop it under the form name in the tree and then change the label to 
Mount Diameter (A).
 
7. Add the following parameters to the tree in the same manner and edit their labels to 
these values (note that Gasket_ID is a user parameter and therefore is found toward the 
bottom of the Parameters tab):
 
◆
Change Hole_Dia to Hole Diameter (B).
 
◆
Change Cen_Cen to Center to Center Hole Space (C).
 
◆
Change Gasket_ID to Gasket Size (D).
Figure 20.22 shows the results you should have once all four parameters are added 
and renamed.
Figure 20.22
Parameters added 
and renamed
 
8. Select the Group control from the Toolbox and drag it into the tree and then drop it below 
Gasket Size (D).
 
9. Change the name of the label from Group 1 to Minimum Dimension Values.
 
10. Locate the Reference node in the list on the Parameters tab and click and drag the follow-
ing parameters to the tree. Then edit their labels to these values:
 
◆
Change Gasket_Space_Hold to Minimum Space = 2 mm (E).
 
◆
Change Gasket_Space_Hold2 to Minimum Space = 2 mm (F).
 
◆
Change HoleChecks to Minimum Space = 2.5 mm (G).
Drop the parameters right on the Minimum Dimension Values group so they will land 
in the group. If you miss, you can just drag and drop them into the group afterward. It’s 
worth mentioning that the values of 2 mm and 2.5 mm come from the existing check 

930 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
rules. The letters listed in parentheses correspond to a legend image to be embedded in 
the form in the next steps. Figure 20.23 shows the Confi gure Plate form at this stage.

11. Select the Picture control from the Toolbox and drag to the bottom of the tree.
 
12. Select the Picture node and then choose the Image property in the Properties pane at 
the bottom. Select the cell that reads (none) and click the resulting button to browse and 
select an image to use. Figure 20.24 shows the Image browse button.

13. Click the browse button and locate and select the fi le mi_20a_008_form_pic.png from 
the Chapter 20 folder.
The image fi le will be placed in your form automatically. This image was created by tak-
ing a screen capture of an IDW fi le, detailing the plate, and then using a photo editor such 
as Microsoft Paint to crop it as needed.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 931
Next, you will change the properties of the Center To Center Hole Space controls to limit 
the inputs to an approved range. Doing so ensures that the user doesn’t specify a value 
that exceeds the size of the plate or would create a need for custom tooling or a special-
order gasket.
 
14. Select the Center To Center Hole Space (C) control from the tree at the top and then locate 
Edit Control Type in the Properties pane.
 
15. Change the control type from Text Box to Slider.
 
16. Expand the Slider Properties and set them as follows:
 
◆
Minimum Value set to 4
 
◆
Maximum Value set to 25
 
◆
Step Size set to 1
 
17. Click the OK button to create the form and close the Form Editor.
 
18. Click the Confi gure Plate button on the Forms tab of the iLogic browser to bring up the 
new form. It should look like Figure 20.25.
Figure 20.25
Th e ﬁ nished plate 
conﬁ guration form

932 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
 
19. Test the functionality of the form as follows:
 
a. Set Mount Diameter to 20 mm and notice that a warning message is thrown. Click the 
OK button in the warning and then set Mount Diameter back to 15 mm.
 
b. Use the Center To Center Hole Space slider and drag it to the left. You’ll notice at 
11 mm, the hole becomes a slot. This is because of the Conditional Suppress option on 
the Slot Cut feature. You can right-click Slot Cut in the browser and choose Properties 
to see how this is done.
 
c. Set Mount Diameter back to 20 mm, and click the OK button in the warning box.
 
d. Use the Gasket Size drop-down to select a smaller size of 100 mm.
Setting the Form Size
You can set up your forms to maintain a speciﬁ c size by following these simple steps:
 1. Edit the form. 
 2. In the lower pane of the Form Editor, locate the Behavior section in the Properties list.
 3. Set the Allow Control Resizing to True.
 4. Click the OK button to exit the Form Editor.
 5. Run the form.
 6. Right-click and choose Resize Controls; then resize as needed.
 7. Th en right-click again and choose Exit Resize Mode.
 8. Close the form and then edit it again.
 9. Now set Allow Control Resizing to False to prevent the form from being accidentally resized in 
the future. 
You can continue adjusting the inputs as you like to test the form. Be aware that if you choose 
a combination of values resulting in violations of all three minimum space rules, it can be a bit 
diffi cult to get the form back to usable values. In the next exercise, you’ll add a reset button and 
more functions to the form to make it a bit more robust.
Using Advanced API Objects
One of the things that makes iLogic so powerful is the ability to use functions from the Inventor 
API from within an iLogic rule. If you’re not familiar with the API, you can ﬁ nd several resources 
to help you get started by searching the Web for Autodesk Inventor Developer Center.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 933
Adding Rules, Tabs, and Event Triggers
In the next exercise, you’ll add a reset button to the form created in the previous exercise. You’ll 
also create a second tab on the form to set standard iProperties. Then, you’ll add event triggers 
to bring the form up automatically when a new part is created from this template and another to 
prompt for iProperty values when the fi le is closed. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Open button on the Get Started tab, browse for mi_20a_009.ipt in the 
Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder, and open it.
 
2. Create a new rule named Reset Form and add the following code:
'resets parameters to default values
Mount_Dia = 15 mm
Hole_Dia = 6 mm
Cen_Cen = 18 mm
Gasket_ID = 115 mm
iLogicVb.UpdateWhenDone = True
 
3. To keep this rule from setting those parameter values automatically, you need to click the 
Options tab and select the Don’t Run Automatically check box. Once this is done, you can 
click the OK button to exit the Edit Rule dialog box.
 
4. From the Forms tab of the iLogic browser, right-click the Confi gure Plate button and 
choose Edit.
 
5. Set the Rules tab active in the Tabs pane on the left.
 
6. Click and drag the Reset Form rule into Form Design pane and drop it under the picture 
at the bottom of the list. This automatically adds a button to run the reset rule, allowing 
you to quickly reset the form to the original values.
 
7. Select the Tab Group control from the Toolbox and drag and drop it into the Form Design 
pane to create a new tab.
 
8. Rename the tab Size Entry.
 
9. Drag the tab to the top of the tree and then drag and drop the following items onto 
Size Entry.
 
◆
Mount Diameter (A)
 
◆
Hole Diameter (B)
 
◆
Center To Center Hole Space (C)
 
◆
Gasket Size (D)
 
10. Drag and drop another Tab Group control into the Form Design pane and rename it 
Property Entry.

11. Set the iProperties tab on the left active and then drag the following iProperties into the 
Form Design pane so they reside in the Property Entry tab:
 
◆
Part Number
 
◆
Description
 
◆
Revision Number
Your Form Design pane and the top of your form should look like Figure 20.26.

Th e improved form
Next, you’ll create a rule to call the Confi gure Plate form and set it to automatically trig-
ger when the fi le is initially created (when this part fi le is used as a template) or opened 
(when an existing version of this part fi le is opened for modifi cations).
 
12. Create a new rule named Call Form and add the following code:
'displays the specified form
iLogicForm.Show("Configure Plate")
 
13. Once the rule is created, select the Manage tab and click the Event Triggers button found 
on the iLogic panel.
 
14. Select the New Document event in the Rules Triggered By Events dialog box, click the 
Select Rules button, and then select the Call Form rule. Click the OK button to return to 
the list of events.
 
15. Add the Call Form rule to the After Open event using the same steps.
 
16. Click the Inventor button in the top-left portion of the application screen and then choose 
Save As and then Save Copy As Template.
 
17. The template directory opens as specifi ed in the Application Options settings. Save the 
fi le as Plate 4792.
 
18. From the Get Started tab, select New and then make sure you are looking at the main 
Templates directory folder using the pane on the right. Then select the Plate 4792 
template.

CREATING ILOGIC PARAMETERS, RULES, AND FORMS | 935
 
19. Once the template is loaded, the Confi gure Plate form displays, allowing you to confi gure 
the plate for the new variation. Use the controls to create a variation and then click Done.
 
20. Save the fi le to the Chapter 20 directory of your Mastering Inventor 2015 folder and 
name it A-4792.ipt.
 
21. Close the fi le and reopen it to make sure the Call Form rule is triggered by the After 
Open event.
Working with iLogic forms is quite simple because of the intuitive drag-and-drop interface. 
You can likely see the power and benefi t to using iLogic rules and forms to confi gure repetitive 
tasks and to enforce consistency as demonstrated here. Feel free to experiment with this fi le to 
add more controls and functionality if you’d like. Or you can close the fi les used in the previous 
steps and continue to the next section without saving changes.
Set Global Forms to Read-only
If you create your forms as global forms, they are saved outside of the Inventor ﬁ le. Once your global 
forms are created and tested, you might want to prevent them from accidentally being changed by 
other users (or yourself). To do so, follow these steps:
 1. Right-click any empty area of the form panel in the browser.
 2. Choose Open Containing Folder.
 3. In this folder, locate the XML ﬁ le with the same name as your form.
 4. Right-click and choose Properties.
 5. On the General tab, select the Read Only check box.
Working with iLogic Components
Because parts and subassemblies with iLogic rules are often confi gured to different sizes and 
with different components, placing them directly into an assembly is generally not the correct 
method. Changes to the iLogic component will impact every assembly it is placed in. Instead, 
you will typically use the Place iLogic Component tool to place a copy of an iLogic component 
into an assembly.
The copy is automatically created in the directory of the assembly you are working in, so it is 
important to save the assembly before using the Place iLogic Component tool. For example, you 
have an assembly called 45–1000.iam in a folder named 45–0000. When you attempt to place 
45–6799.ipt using the Place iLogic Component tool, it’s actually a copy that is placed in the 
assembly fi le, and the copy will be named 45–6799–01.ipt. This fi le will be created in the 45–0000 
folder. If you placed another version of 45–6799.ipt into the same assembly using the Place iLogic 
Component tool, it would be named 45–6799–02.ipt and placed in the 45–0000 folder.

936 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Placing iLogic Subassemblies
When you place an iLogic subassembly, all components in the same directory or subdirectories of 
that subassembly are copied to the directory of the main assembly and assigned unique names.
Th erefore, it’s recommended that you organize your iLogic subassembly ﬁ les with standard mod-
els outside of the directory of the subassembly that will be placed as an iLogic component. Th is 
can be done by saving them in a Content Center directory or another library directory. When you 
place the assembly as an iLogic component, these ﬁ les are not copied to the directory of the main 
assembly and the iLogic component in the assembly maintains its links to the original ﬁ les, in 
their original locations.
You can follow these steps to use the Place iLogic Component tool:
 
1. From the Component panel of the Assembly tab, click the Place drop-down arrow and 
select the Place iLogic Component button.
 
2. Browse for and select the component to be placed. Then click Open.
The component parameters are listed in a small dialog box. If the component contains 
Key parameters, only those parameters are included in the list; otherwise, all parameters 
are included. Initially, all parameters are designated as <Free> in the From Assembly 
column. This indicates that they are not driven by assembly parameters. Changing a free 
parameter value during placement allows you to confi gure the component upon place-
ment, and the preview updates to show the changes made.
 
3. Click the drop-down arrow in the From Assembly column to see the list of assem-
bly parameters available to drive the corresponding parameter. (Driving parameters 
must exist in the assembly and therefore should be created before placing the iLogic 
component.)
 
4. Click the OK button after making your changes.
 
5. iLogic starts the Place Component tool, allowing you to place a copy of the original iLogic 
component in the assembly.
iLogic Design Copy
You can use the iLogic Design Copy tool to create copies of assemblies and their documenta-
tion. To use the iLogic Design Copy tool, you must fi rst close all of your open Inventor fi les. 
Then, in the iLogic panel on the Tools tab, click the iLogic Design Copy button. In the resulting 
dialog box, you can select the iLogic fi les to copy. When a fi le is selected, the referenced fi les are 
selected as well. You can also choose to copy unlinked Inventor or non-Inventor fi les related to 
the job you are copying.
Once fi les are selected, you specify the destination folder to which the fi les will be copied, 
and you can set fi le prefi xing or suffi xing to be appended to the original fi lenames. Another 
important option is the ability to maintain or delete the existing rules in the new copy. This 
allows you to start over with a clean project when needed or use the existing iLogic rules in the 
new design when that is preferred.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 937
Use iLogic to Fill Out Title Blocks
If you have a Drawn By ﬁ eld and a Date ﬁ eld in your title block, you might ﬁ nd it diﬃ  cult to remem-
ber to edit the iProperties when saving the ﬁ le or rolling the revision to a new drawing. You can 
use iLogic to assist with this.
Create an iLogic rule to write the username (pulled from the General tab in the Application Options 
dialog) and the current date (pulled from your system setting) to the drawing ﬁ le’s iProperties. 
You can then set your title block ﬁ elds to read those iProperties. And you can set the rule to be 
triggered using the Before Save Document event trigger so that the title block is always updated 
at the time of the ﬁ le save.
Here is a bit of sample code to do this:
myName= ThisApplication.GeneralOptions.UserName
If iProperties.Value("Summary", "Author") <> myName Then
iProperties.Value("Summary", "Author") = myName
MessageBox.Show("The Title block has been updated", _
"an iLogic message for: " & myName)
End If
iProperties.Value("Project", "Creation Date") = Now
InventorVb.DocumentUpdate()

blog: http://inventortrenches.blogspot.com. 
Th e Bottom Line
Create iLogic rules.  Use iLogic rules to document and embed into your models the 
common design rules that you use every day to determine the decisions required in your 
design process.
Master It  How can you add a rule to your part to change the size of it?
Edit iLogic rules.  A large part of working with iLogic is testing and editing the rules you 
create. Often, it’s best to add a function at a time to the rule and test it along the way.
Master It  Your rule works, but you have to manually update the model. Do you need to 
create a new rule to handle the update?
Use multi-value list parameters.  A common part of any design rule process is selecting 
from a list of standard entities. You can create multi-value list parameters from Numeric or 
Text parameters to add lists.
Master It  How would you create a rule that prompts you to select from a list of 
approved sizes?

938 | CHAPTER 20 ILOGIC
Work with multiple rules in the same fi le.  It is often best to create several small rules 
rather than try to create one large rule that does it all. This helps you maintain and trouble-
shoot the code later, and it also allows you to use rules in multiple applications without the 
need to remove or edit existing code. This is particularly true when working with external 
rules, which might be used in varying applications later.
Master It  You’ve created two smaller rules because it makes sense to do so, but when 
you try to run one, the other is triggered also. Do you need to combine them into 
one rule?
Use conditional statements.  Conditional statements are the foundation of any pro-
grammed logic. Learning how to use If, Then, and Select Case statements will go a long 
way in helping you solve logical problems when creating rules.
Master It  How can you check the value of a parameter or its state with an iLogic rule?
Suppress features.  Confi guring a part fi le to include and exclude features is often based on 
engineering decisions you make every day. Setting up your iLogic rules to do this is straight-
forward, provided the model is well constructed to start with.
Master It  When you use the Feature.IsActive function on one feature, it causes an 
error in the part. How can a feature be suppressed without suppressing a dependent 
feature?
Work with iProperties.  iProperties are a powerful part of working with Inventor. Being 
able to retrieve and use metadata helps with all parts of the engineering process. Automating 
the process of fi lling out iProperty data with iLogic is a big step forward.
Master It  Can iLogic be used to update the title block of a drawing?
Create iLogic forms.  iLogic forms make creating a user interface for your iLogic pursuits 
quite easy. The drag-and-drop tools provide professional-looking forms with minimal effort.
Master It  You have existing part fi les with no iLogic in them, and it would be nice to 
use the form you created in the most recent design to update those old designs as revi-
sions require it. Can forms be created and shared across part fi les?
Build a part confi guration form.  Confi guring Inventor components saves time, reduces 
human error, and promotes consistency. Using iLogic forms to confi gure common designs is 
a good way to go.
Master It   Can an iLogic form help with parts that are basically the same but have a lot 
of variation in the features they include?  

Appendix A
Th e Bottom Line
Each of The Bottom Line sections in the chapters suggest exercises to deepen skills and under-
standing. Sometimes there is only one possible solution, but often you are encouraged to use 
your skills and creativity to create something that builds on what you know and lets you 
explore one of many possible solutions.
Chapter 1: Getting Started
Create parametric designs.  The power of parameter-based design comes from the quick 
and easy edits, when changing a parameter value drives a change through the design. To 
make changes easily, though, you need to follow certain general rules so that the changes 
update predictably.
Master It  You want to create a model of a base plate, a rectangular-shaped part with 
a series of holes and rectangular cutouts. What would your initial sketch look like in 
Inventor?
Solution  To start a model for the base plate, your initial sketch would most likely be just 
a rectangle defi ning the width and length of the part. This rectangle would be extruded 
to give it a thickness, and then you would create secondary sketches for the other features 
and cut them from the plate. This approach follows the best practice of creating simple 
sketches to create simple features to build a complex part.
Get the “feel” of Inventor.  The interface contains many elements that change and update 
to give you the tools you need to perform the task at hand. Getting comfortable with these 
automatic changes and learning to anticipate them will help you get the “feel” of Inventor.
Master It  You create an extrude feature using the Extrude button, but you cannot seem 
to fi nd an Edit Extrude button. How can you edit the extruded feature to change the 
height?
Solution  To edit an extruded feature (or any feature), you can simply right-click it in the 
browser and choose Edit Feature. This makes feature edits universal, so a separate edit 
tool is not required for each feature type. Keep in mind that for most features, you can 
double-click the feature button in the browser to edit it as well.
Use the Inventor graphical interface.  Inventor 2015 uses the Ribbon menu interface fi rst 
introduced in Inventor 2010. Tools are grouped, which makes fi nding them intuitive once you 
become familiar with the basic layout.

940 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  You are trying to draw a line on the face of a part, but you seem to have lost 
the Sketch tab in the ribbon. How do you get it back?
Solution  The Sketch tab is present only when you have created a new sketch or are 
editing an existing sketch. To draw a line, you need to access the Line tool. You must fi rst 
use the New Sketch tool to create a sketch, and then you will see the Sketch tab and on it 
the Line tool.
Work with Inventor fi le types.   Inventor supports many different fi le types in its native 
environment, separating tasks and fi les to improve performance and increase stability.
Master It  You have trouble keeping the various fi le types straight because all the fi le 
icons look rather similar to you. Is there a way you can see which fi le is what type?
Solution  You may want to turn on the view of fi lename extensions on your system so 
that you can read them (.ipt, .iam, .idw, and so on) as you open and save fi les. See the 
sidebar “Turning on Filename Extensions” in Chapter 1 for instructions on how to do so.
Understand how project search paths work.  Knowing how Inventor resolves fi le paths 
when it opens linked fi les, such as assembly fi les and drawings, goes a long way toward help-
ing prevent broken links and repairing links that do get broken.
Master It  What type of fi le does Inventor use to point the assembly fi le to the parts that 
it contains?
Solution  Inventor uses the project fi le (*.ipj) to hold workspace and library search 
paths. If fi les are outside of these search paths, Inventor will not fi nd the fi les, and you 
will be required to point the assembly to them each and every time.
Set up library and Content Center paths.  Library and Content Center paths are read-only 
library confi gurations set up in the project fi le.
Master It  When you set up a library or Content Center path to a folder that does not 
exist, what happens?
Solution  When you create a path to a nonexistent folder, Inventor will create that folder 
for you. Keep this in mind when you create paths in the project fi le, and watch out for 
spelling and syntax errors because Inventor will create a new folder with an incorrectly 
spelled name as well.
Create and confi gure a project fi le.  Project fi les are a key component of working success-
fully in Inventor, but for many people, this is a one-time setup. Once the project is created, for 
the most part you just use it as is.
Master It  After creating a project fi le initially, you want to make one or more changes to 
the confi guration, but you can’t seem to do so. What could be the problem?
Solution  Keep in mind that while you are working with a project fi le, it is held in a 
read-only status by Inventor. To make changes, you need to fi rst close all of the fi les you 
have open that are included in the project path. If you close all the fi les and the project 
is still held in the read-only state, switch to a different project in Inventor, browse for 
the IPJ fi le in Windows Explorer, and then right-click and check the Read-only attribute 
of the IPJ fi le. Windows often seems to leave the Read-only attribute set on IPJ fi les, and 

CHAPTER 2: A HANDSON TESTDRIVE OF THE WORKFLOW | 941
then it needs to be manually taken off. Once it is off, you can switch back to that project in 
Inventor and make changes.
Determine the best project type for you.  Although the Autodesk solution to a multiuser 
environment is Autodesk Vault, many people may not be able to use Vault. For instance, if 
you use another CAD application that links fi les together like Inventor, Vault will likely not 
know how to manage the internal links for those fi les.
Master It  Because you generally do not work concurrently on the same fi les as your 
co-workers, you think it might be best to set up a single-user project for now while you 
continue to investigate the Vault solution, but you are not sure if that will work. Can 
single-user projects be used in this manner?
Solution  Set up a single-user project and then point everyone’s computer to that fi le. 
Keep a close eye on how well it works in the fi rst several days, and watch for signs that 
people are making changes to the fi le at the same time. If your workfl ow is fairly linear, 
with one department handing fi les off to the next, this may not be an issue. However, if 
you see that people are reaching for the same fi les at the same time, you probably need to 
make Vault a priority.
Chapter 2: A Hands-on Test-Drive of the Workﬂ ow
Create a part model.  The process of creating a part model starts with an *.ipt template 
fi le. Once you’ve started a part model from a template, you create sketches to defi ne feature 
profi les, and then you make those profi les into 3D features using one of the 3D modeling 
feature tools.
Master It  You created a base 3D feature for your parts by extruding a sketch profi le at 
a distance of 15 mm. Then you created other sketches on the top face of the base feature. 
However, you now realize that the base feature should have been 25 mm thick. Can the 
base feature be changed after you’ve created other features on it?
Solution  To modify part features, you can right-click them in the browser and choose 
Edit Feature. Inventor employs the same dialog box used to create a feature originally to 
edit that feature.
Create and detail drawings of part models.  The process of creating a drawing fi le starts 
with an *.idw template fi le. Once you’ve started a drawing from a template, you create views 
of a referenced part model fi le. After the views are created, you can add dimensions and 
other annotations to the view.
Master It  You’ve created a drawing of a part model and then realize that you need to 
make a change to that model. How will the change to the part model be handled by the 
drawing fi le?
Solution  When you edit a part model that is referenced in a drawing view, the view 
will automatically update. If you change the length of a part model and you have cre-
ated a dimension for this length in the drawing, that dimension will update as well. If 
you dimensioned from the edge of the part to the center of a hole feature in the drawing 
and then edited the part model fi le and deleted the hole, Inventor will either remove the 

942 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
drawing dimension or reserve the dimension and highlight it in a different color to call 
attention to the removed feature.
Put part models together in assembly fi les.  The process of creating an assembly model 
starts with an *.iam template fi le. Once you’ve started an assembly model from a template, 
you place part model fi les into the assembly and then use Assembly constraints to arrange 
and assemble the part models.
Master It  You’ve assembled your part models in an assembly fi le and then need to 
make a change to a part-model fi le. How will the change to the part model be handled by 
the assembly fi le?
Solution  Changes made to a part-model fi le will be refl ected in all the assemblies in 
which that part-model fi le was used. If the edit to the part model involved changing the 
length of the part, most likely the Assembly constraints will update properly, because the 
faces and edges of the part model used in the Assembly constraint are still present but 
have just been adjusted in size. If a part feature such as a hole was deleted from the part, 
any Assembly constraints that used that hole feature geometry would need to be edited 
or deleted.
Create and detail drawings of assembly models.  The process of creating an assembly 
drawing starts with an *.idw template fi le, just as it did with creating part drawings. Once 
you’ve started a drawing from a template, you can create views of a referenced assembly 
model fi le. After the views are created, you can add annotations such as parts lists and call-
out balloons, as well as dimensions, text notes, and so on.
Master It  You’ve created a drawing of an assembly model and then realize that you 
need to make a change to one of the part fi les within that the assembly model. How will 
the change to the part model be handled by the drawing of the assembly?
Solution  When you edit a part model that is referenced in an assembly model, the 
assembly is updated. If edits to the Assembly constraints are needed, it’s best to open 
the assembly fi le and take care of those things fi rst. Then the views in the assembly 
drawing will automatically update as expected.
Chapter 3: Sketch Techniques
Set up options and settings for the sketch environment.  Understanding the settings 
and options that apply to the sketch environment is an essential fi rst step in working with 
Inventor.
Master It  You want to confi gure your own set of options and settings for your sketch 
environment and then back them up and/or distribute them to other workstations. How 
would you do this?
Solution  There are primarily two sets of options you can confi gure in Inventor. The 
application options confi gure Inventor itself, and the document settings confi gure 
the settings on a per-fi le basis. You access both options and settings by clicking either the 
Application Options or the Document Settings button on the Tools tab. In the Application 
Options dialog box, select the Sketch tab to confi gure the sketch environment. Once the 
changes are made, you can click the Export button to save the settings as an XML fi le for 
redistribution.

CHAPTER 3: SKETCH TECHNIQUES | 943
Create a sketch from a part fi le template.  Creating a sketch in a blank template fi le is the 
fundamental step in creating 3D parametric models. You will use this basic step to start most 
of your part designs.
Master It  How would you capture the intent of your design when creating a base sketch 
for a new part?
Solution  Use a combination of lines, arcs, and geometry as well as sketch constraints 
and dimensions to properly constrain your sketch. You can then use this sketch to create 
a base feature for your part. Keep in mind the importance of keeping sketches simple and 
fully constrained.
Use sketch constraints to control sketch geometry.  Understanding what each sketch con-
straint does when applied will allow you to determine when to use each type. Recall that 
often more than one constraint will work in any given situation.
Master It  How would you create a sketch that allows you to test “what if?” scenarios 
concerning the general shape and size of your part?
Solution  First ensure that your sketches are properly constrained. Sketches that are 
properly constrained are needed to allow you to experiment with your dimensional 
parameters by changing values and testing “what if?” scenarios. If the sketch geometry is 
not properly constrained, changes to dimensions may create unpredictable results.
Master general sketch tools.  Learning the features and tricks of the sketch tools will allow 
you to master Inventor sketching.
Master It  You are given a print of mixed units to work from, and you need to enter dimen-
sions exactly as they are on the print. You understand that you can enter any dimensions in 
any unit simply by adding the correct suffi x. But how would you create a radius dimension 
on a circle or a dimension from the tangents of a slot?
Solution  Recall that you switch between variant dimension solutions such as diameter 
to radius simply by right-clicking after having selected the geometry. You can also get 
alternate dimension solutions by selecting different parts of the same geometry. For 
instance, selecting a line and then almost anywhere on a circle will give you a dimension 
from the center point of the circle to the line, whereas selecting a line and the tangent 
quadrant point of the circle will give you a dimension from the tangent point of the circle 
and the line.
Create sketches from AutoCAD geometry.  You can use existing AutoCAD fi les to create a 
base sketch for an Inventor model of the same part.
Master It  You have many existing 2D AutoCAD drawings detailing legacy parts. You 
want to reuse these designs as you convert to 3D modeling. How would you proceed?
Solution  You can copy and paste selected geometry from AutoCAD directly into an 
Inventor sketch and then turn it into a solid model. Keep in mind that the results are de-
pendent on the accuracy of the original AutoCAD data. Once you become profi cient with 
Inventor, it is often just as quick to model a part from scratch rather than by copying it.
Use 3D sketch tools.  Much of working with a 3D parametric modeler can be done by sketching 
in a two-dimensional plane and then giving depth to the sketch to create 3D features. However, 
sometimes you need to create paths or curves that are not planar. In those cases, you use the 3D 
sketch tools.

944 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  You know the profi le of a complex curve as viewed from the top and side. 
How would you create a 3D sketch from this data?
Solution  Start by creating a separate 2D sketch for both the top and side views of the 
curve. Then create a 3D sketch and use the 3D Intersection Curve tool to fi nd the inter-
secting curve.
Chapter 4: Basic Modeling Techniques
Confi gure options and settings for part modeling.  Understanding the settings and options 
that apply to the modeling environment is essential for getting the results you want from 
Inventor.
Master It  You want to confi gure your options and settings for your sketch environment 
and then back them up and/or distribute them to other workstations. How would you go 
about doing this?
Solution  You would fi rst confi gure the options and settings by clicking Application 
Options on the Get Started tab and then selecting the Sketch tab in the Application Options 
dialog box. Then you would use the Export button to save the settings as an XML fi le.
Create basic part features.  In this chapter, you learned how to plan a workfl ow that allows 
you to create stable, editable parts that preserve the design intent.
Master It  You need to create a fairly complex part consisting of many extrusions, 
revolves, sweeps, and lofts. In addition, you will need to create holes, fi llets, chamfers, 
and other part modifi ers. This part may need signifi cant modifi cation in the future by 
you or by other designers. What considerations will guide your part creation?
Solution  Determine how this part will be manufactured. Think about how the part might 
be designed to minimize production costs while still fulfi lling the intent of the design by 
determining how many machining operations will be required. Determine the design 
intent of this part and how your approach will affect stability and any future edits or 
modifi cations.
Use the Extrude tool.  The Extrude tool is one of the most commonly used feature tools in 
the Inventor modeling toolset. Understanding the options and solutions available in this tool 
will prove useful throughout your designs.
Master It  Imagine that you need to create an extruded feature but don’t know the exact 
length; instead, you know the extrude will always terminate based on another feature. 
However, the location of that feature has not been fully determined just yet. How do you 
get started on the feature?
Solution  Use the Extrude To option and extrude the feature profi le to a face or work 
plane of the other feature. Then, as you determine the location of the other feature and 
make adjustments, your extrusion will update as well.
Create revolved parts and thread features.  Creating revolved features and parts in Inventor 
can often resemble the creation of turned parts and features in the real world. Applying 
thread features to a cylindrical face allows you to specify threads without having to actually 
model them.

CHAPTER 4: BASIC MODELING TECHNIQUES | 945
Master It  Let’s say you have a part that you intend to fabricate on a lathe. Although you 
could create the part with a series of stepped circular extrusions, it occurs to you that the 
Revolve tool might work also. How do you decide which method to use?
Solution  Oftentimes it may make sense to create a base extrusion from an extruded cir-
cle and then use the Revolve tool to create revolved cuts. This allows you to design both 
the stock material and the cut features with the intent of the design in mind, anticipating 
changes that might occur. You can then use the Thread tool to apply threads to any fea-
tures requiring them.
Create work features.  Using work features, work planes, work axes, and work points 
enable you to create virtually any part or feature. Work features are the building blocks for 
sketch creation and use.
Master It  Your design will require creating features on spherical and cylindrical faces. 
You need to precisely control the location and angle of these features. How do you do 
that?
Solution  Using existing origin features, created model features and edges, sketch 
objects, and other existing geometry within the fi le will permit you to create parametric 
work features as the basis for additional geometry creation.
Use the Fillet tool.  The Fillet tool has a great deal of functionality packed into it. Taking 
the time to explore all the options on a simple test model may be the best way to understand 
them all.
Master It  You are trying to create a series of fi llets on a part. You create four sets of edge 
selections to have four different fi llet sizes, but when you attempt to apply them, you 
receive an error stating that the feature cannot be built. What went wrong?
Solution  Sometimes the creation of multiple fi llet sizes combined into one feature is not 
the way to go. Instead, identify the edges that will “compete” for a common corner, par-
ticularly where they differ in radius size, and create these fi llets as individual fi llet fea-
tures. This allows Inventor to solve the corner in steps and makes the results more robust 
and less ambiguous.
Create intelligent hole features.  Although you can create a hole in a part by sketching a 
circle and extrude-cutting it, this is typically not the recommended approach.
Master It  You need to create a part with a series of various-sized holes on a plate. You 
would like to lay out the hole pattern in a single sketch and then use the Hole tool to cut 
the holes to the sizes required. However, when you select the From Sketch option in the 
Hole tool, it selects all of the holes, so you think you must need to sketch out the hole 
pattern as circles and then use the Extrude tool to cut them out. Is this really the way 
to proceed?
Solution  Using the Extrude tool is not the way to go. Instead, create a sketch on the face 
of the plate and use center points to mark the hole centers. Dimension each center point 
in place and then start the Hole tool. Hold down Ctrl to deselect the center points for 
holes of a different size and then create the hole feature for the fi rst set of holes. Locate 
your sketch in the browser, right-click it, and choose Share Sketch. Then use the Hole tool 
to place the next size holes.

946 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Bend parts.  You can bend a portion of a part after you defi ne a bend line using a 2D sketch 
line. You can specify the side of the part to bend; the direction of the bend; and its angle, 
radius, or arc length.
Master It  You need to create a model of a piece of rolled tube and would like to specify 
the bend direction, but when you use the direction arrow, you get a preview in only one 
direction. How can you get a preview in either direction?
Solution  Use a work plane to create a sketch in the middle of the part and then sketch the 
bend line on that work plane. This will allow you to specify either direction for the bend.
Chapter 5: Advanced Modeling Techniques
Create complex sweeps and lofts.  Complex geometry is created by using multiple work 
planes, sketches, and 3D sketch geometry. Honing your experience in creating work planes 
and 3D sketches is paramount to success in creating complex models.
Master It  How would you create a piece of twisted, fl at bar in Inventor?
Solution  Create the fl at bar profi le in a base sketch. Then create a work plane offset 
from the original sketch and make it the length of the bar. Create the profi le sketch on 
this work plane at a rotated orientation to match the degree of twist needed. Create a 3D 
sketch and connect the corners of the fi rst profi le to the appropriate corners of the second 
profi le. Using the 3D sketch lines as rails, use the Loft tool to loft from one profi le to the 
other to produce the twisted part.
Work with multi-body and derived parts.  Multi-body parts can be used to create part fi les 
with features that require precise matching between two or more parts. Once the solid bod-
ies are created, you can create a separate part fi le for each component.
Master It  What would be the best way to create an assembly of four parts that require 
features to mate together in different positions?
Solution  Create the parts in a multi-body part fi le and subtract material from one part 
based on the profi le of the other. Consider creating the fi rst two parts in one multi-body 
part fi le and the other two in another multi-body part fi le to keep the fi les as simple as 
possible. You can also derive the fi rst multi-body part into the second for better control.
Utilize part tolerances.  Dimensional tolerancing of sketches allows you to check stack-
up variations within assemblies. When you add tolerances to critical dimensions within 
sketches, you can adjust parts to maximum, minimum, and nominal conditions.
Master It  You want to create a model feature with a deviation so you can test the assem-
bly fi t at the extreme ends of the tolerances. How would this be done?
Solution  Use the Parameters dialog box to set up and adjust tolerances for individual 
dimensions. In the Parameters dialog box, set the tolerance to the upper or lower limits 
for the part and then update the model using the Update button. Check the fi t of the fea-
ture against its mating part or parts in the assembly environment and then edit the part 
to set it back to the nominal once done.
Understand and use parameters and iProperties.  Using parameters within fi les assists in 
the creation of title blocks, parts lists, and annotation within 2D drawings. Using parameters 

CHAPTER 6: SHEET METAL | 947
in an assembly fi le allows the control of constraints and objects within the assembly. Exporting 
parameters allows the creation of custom properties. Proper use of iProperties facilitates the 
creation of accurate 2D drawings that always refl ect the current state of included parts and 
assemblies.
Master It  You want to create a formula to determine the spacing of a hole pattern based 
on the length of the part. What tools would you use?
Solution  Set up a user parameter that calls the part length and divides by the number 
of holes or the spacing and then reference this user parameter in the hole pattern feature.
Troubleshoot modeling failures.  Modeling failures are often caused by poor design 
practices. Poor sketching techniques, bad design workfl ow, and other factors can lead to the 
elimination of design intent within a model.
Master It  You want to modify a rather complex existing part fi le, but when you change 
the feature, errors cascade down through the entire part. How can you change the feature 
without this happening?
Solution  Position the end-of-part marker just under the feature you intend to modify 
and then make the change. Then move the end-of-part marker back down the feature tree 
one feature at a time, addressing each error as it occurs. Use the Rebuild All tool from 
time to time to see whether recomputing the tree will force a “fi x” to cascade down the 
tree. Continue until all features have been fi xed.
Chapter 6: Sheet Metal
Take advantage of the specifi c sheet-metal features available in Inventor.  Knowing what 
features are available to help realize your design can make more effi cient and productive use 
of your time.
Master It  Of the sheet-metal features discussed, how many require a sketch to produce 
their result?
Solution  Five sheet-metal features consume a sketch: Contour Flange, Face, Cut, Punch, 
and Fold. Since Inventor has well-established paradigms for how sketches can be manip-
ulated, knowing which features consume sketches may allow you to develop designs that 
are fl exible and parametrically confi gurable.
Understand sheet-metal templates and rules.  Templates can help get your design started 
on the right path, and sheet-metal rules and associated styles allow you to drive powerful 
and intelligent manufacturing variations into your design; combining the two can be produc-
tive as long as you understand some basic principles.
Master It  Name two methods that can be used to publish a sheet-metal rule from a 
sheet-metal part fi le to the style library.
Solution  Rules and styles can be published or written to the style library either from 
Inventor or by using the Style Management Wizard (the harvester). Using the native Inventor 
method, right-clicking a given rule/style produces an option called Save To Style Library. 
Using the harvester, you can select a specifi c fi le and add its style information to your exist-
ing style library, or you can create a new one.

948 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Author and insert punch tooling.  Creating and managing Punch tools can streamline your 
design process and standardize tooling in your manufacturing environment.
Master It  Name two methods that can be utilized to produce irregular (nonsymmetric) 
patterns of punch features.
Solution  Sketch center marks can be patterned within the insertion sketch as a symmetric 
array. During Punch tool insertion, the Centers control on the Geometry tab can be used to 
deselect center marks where you want a tool to be placed. The feature-patterning tools can 
also be used to create irregular patterns after a punch feature has been created. You can 
do this by fi rst creating a symmetric pattern of punch features, then expanding the child 
pattern occurrences in the feature browser, and fi nally individually suppressing them. Both 
methods prevent the feature from being displayed in the folded and fl at pattern as well as 
omit the Punch tool information in the fl at-pattern punch metadata.
Utilize the fl at pattern information and options.  The sheet-metal folded model captures 
your manufacturing intent during the design process; understanding how to leverage this 
information and customize it for your needs can make you extremely productive.
Master It  How can you change the reported angle of all your Punch features by 
90 degrees?
Solution  The fl at pattern’s orientation infers a virtual x-axis for punch angle calcula-
tion, so rotating the fl at pattern by 90 degrees will change all the punch angles by the 
same amount. The fl at pattern can also affect the bend and punch direction (up or down) 
by fl ipping the base face, and reported bend angles can be changed from Bending Angle 
to Open Angle by changing options in the Bend Angle tab of the Flat Pattern Defi nition 
dialog box.
Understand the nuances of sheet-metal iPart factories.  Sheet-metal iPart factories enable 
you to create true manufacturing confi gurations with the inclusion of folded and fl at pattern 
models in each member fi le.
Master It  If you created sheet-metal iPart factories prior to Inventor 2009, any instanti-
ated fi les contain only a folded model. Name two methods that you could use to drive the 
fl at pattern model into the instantiated fi le.
Solution  Once you have opened, migrated, and saved a legacy sheet-metal iPart factory, 
you can decide between two methodologies for obtaining the fl at pattern model within 
your instantiated fi les: push or pull. The push method is accomplished from within the 
iPart factory by using the context menu option Generate Files, which is associated with 
the member fi lename. This method pushes out a new defi nition of the member fi le 
including the fl at pattern model. The pull method requires you to be using the Inventor 
Rebuild All tool, followed by saving the factory fi le. Now that the factory has been 
rebuilt, any time you open one of the instantiated fi les associated with the factory, it will 
see that it’s out-of-date and will trip the update fl ag. Selecting Update will pull the fl at 
pattern model into the instantiated member fi le.
Model sheet-metal components with non-sheet-metal features.  Inventor doesn’t always 
allow you to restrict yourself to sheet metal–specifi c design tools; understanding how to 
utilize non-sheet-metal features will ensure that your creativity is limitless.

CHAPTER 7: REUSING PARTS AND FEATURES | 949
Master It  Name two non-sheet-metal features that can lead to unfolding problems if 
used to create your design.
Solution  As discussed in the chapter, Loft and Shell can lead to numerous problems 
during unfolding because of nondevelopable curvature introduced by Loft and nonuni-
form thickness introduced by Shell.
Work with imported sheet-metal parts.  Understanding the way in which Inventor accom-
plishes unfolding as well as how to associate an appropriate sheet-metal rule are keys to suc-
cessfully working with imported parts.
Master It  Name the one measured value that is critical if you want to unfold an 
imported part.
Solution  The measured sheet thickness is the most important geometric measure-
ment in an imported sheet-metal part. Ensuring that the thickness of your imported 
part matches the active Thickness parameter means the difference between success and 
frustration. Although you can change the active rule (or create a new one) to match all the 
geometric conditions of your imported part, these will affect only new features or topol-
ogy that you introduce. Thickness is the key.
Understand the tools available to annotate your sheet-metal design.  Designing your 
component is essential, but it’s equally important to understand the tools that are available to 
effi ciently document your design and extract your embedded manufacturing intent.
Master It  What process is required to recover fl at pattern width and height extents 
within your Drawing Manager parts list?
Solution  By creating custom iProperties within your sheet-metal part fi le set equal to 
<FLAT PATTERN LENGTH> cm and <FLAT PATTERN WIDTH> cm, you can reference 
fl at pattern extents by your parts list by adding these new properties using the Column 
Chooser tool. To make this process more effi cient, you can predefi ne the custom iProper-
ties in your sheet-metal template fi le, and the custom properties can be authored into a 
custom Drawing Manager parts list template for quick application.
Chapter 7: Reusing Parts and Features
Create and modify iParts.  iParts are the solution to creating parts that allow for an infi nite 
number of variations without affecting other members of the same part family already used 
within your designs.
Master It  You use a purchased specialty part in your designs and would like to create 
the many size confi gurations that this part comes in ahead of time for use within assem-
bly design. How would this be done?
Solution  Create or use an existing model and edit the parameter list to use logical 
names for specifi c parameters. Add the confi guration table by creating an iPart from this 
model. Confi gure the parameters in the table and add rows according to variations 
needed. And fi nally, test the newly created iPart by inserting all variations of the part 
into a blank assembly.

950 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Create and use iFeatures and punches.  Creating a library of often-used features is essen-
tial to standardization and improved productivity within your design workfl ow.
Master It  You want to be able to place common punches, slots, and milled features 
quickly rather than having to generate the feature every time. What is the best way to 
approach this?
Solution  Extract iFeatures from existing standard and sheet-metal part features and 
place them in user-defi ned folders within the Catalog subfolder. Using your custom-
created iFeatures as well as standard iFeatures, practice placing them into your designs to 
see how they behave and how they can be modifi ed. Finally, once the iFeatures or 
punches have been proven to work as expected, use them to quickly place common fea-
tures in your production designs.
Copy and clone features.  You do not have to create iFeatures to reuse various part features 
in your designs. If a part feature will have limited use in other designs, it is often better to 
simply copy it from part to part or from face to face on the same part.
Master It  You need to reuse features within a part or among parts. You consider 
iFeatures but realize that this feature is not used often enough to justify setting up an 
iFeature. How would you proceed?
Solution  Right-click the existing feature and choose Copy. Determine whether depen-
dent and independent features such as fi llets and chamfers need to be copied as well and 
then paste the feature onto another face in the same part. Or open a different part fi le and 
paste onto a selected face. Copying between two parts is called cloning.
Link parameters between two fi les.  Linking design parameters between two or more fi les 
allows you to control design changes from a single source, making it easy to update an entire 
design from one fi le.
Master It  You want to specify the overall length and width of a layout design in a base 
part and then have other components update as changes are made to this part. What are 
the methods to do this?
Solution  From the other component fi les, open the parameter editor, use the Link but-
ton to specify the source fi le, and then choose which parameters to link. You can then call 
those linked parameters into the sketch and feature dimensions of the other components 
in your design.
Confi gure, create, and access Content Center parts.  Content Center provides a great 
opportunity to reuse database-created geometry within assemblies and within functional-
design modules. The Content Center Editor provides the means to add custom content into 
Content Center. You can create and add custom libraries to your current project fi le.
Master It  You would like to change the part numbers in some Content Center compo-
nents to match the part numbers your company uses. You would also like to add propri-
etary components to Content Center. How do you customize Content Center?
Solution  Create a custom Content Center library. Confi gure your project fi le to include 
your newly created read/write Content Center library. Utilize the Content Center Editor 
to create new categories within your custom Content Center library. Convert a part or an 
iPart to a Content Center component using the Publish option.

CHAPTER 8: ASSEMBLY DESIGN WORKFLOWS | 951
Chapter 8: Assembly Design Workﬂ ows
Create assembly relationships using the Constraint and Joint tools.  Assembly 
relationships are an important part of working with Inventor assembly fi les. Assembly 
constraints determine how assembly components fi t together. As relationships are applied 
between components, degrees of freedom are removed.
Master It  You are new to 3D and fi nd the concept of assembly relationships a bit 
challenging. Where can you fi nd a simple overview of constraints?
Solution  You can fi nd a good overview of constraints by selecting the Get Started tab 
and clicking the Place And Connect Parts button in the tutorials section. From there, you 
can follow the interactive tutorial using the panel on the right.
Organize designs using structured subassemblies.  Subassemblies add organization, 
facilitate the bill of materials, and reduce assembly relationships; all this results in better per-
formance and easier edits. One of the habits of all Inventor experts is their effective use and 
understanding of subassemblies.
Master It  You need to hand off an accurate BOM for fi nished designs to the purchas-
ing department at the end of each design project. How can the BOM be extracted from 
Inventor?
Solution  Organize parts in subassemblies in a real-world manner matching the way 
components are assembled on the shop fl oor. Use Phantom assemblies when structuring 
parts merely for the purpose of reducing assembly relationships. Set assemblies as 
Purchased or Inseparable when you want multiple components to appear as a single 
item in the BOM. Export the BOM from the assembly to an Excel spreadsheet or other 
intermediate format to give to purchasing.
Work with adaptive components.  Geometry can be set to be adaptive so that it can be 
sized and positioned in the context of where it is used in the assembly. You can set under-
constrained geometry to be adaptive by specifying the elements allowed to adapt.
Master It  You want to set a feature of a part to be adaptive so that it can adapt to 
another part in an assembly. However, the feature is based on a fully constrained sketch. 
How would this be done?
Solution  To set a fully constrained sketch to be adaptive, you would edit the sketch and 
then set the dimensions that are intended to adapt to be driven dimensions. Doing so 
leaves the sketch in an underconstrained state, opening it up for adaptivity.
Create assembly-level features.  An assembly feature is a feature created and utilized 
within the active assembly fi le. Because the feature is created within the assembly fi le, it does 
not exist at the single-part or subassembly level.
Master It  You want to make a notch in a standard part that will not affect its use in 
every other assembly it is used in. Can this be done?
Solution  Create the notch in the assembly that it is used in rather than the part fi le it-
self, and then the notch will exist only for that instance of the part and not in other 
instances of it.

952 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Manage bills of materials.  Managing a bill of materials can be a large part of any assembly 
design task. Understanding the BOM structure goes a long way toward successfully confi g-
uring your bill of materials.
Master It  You need to mark a component as a reference component in just one assembly 
fi le. However, when you attempt to do so using the BOM Editor, it is designated as a ref-
erence in every assembly. How can you set just a single instance of a component to be a 
reference component?
Solution  When components are set to reference in the BOM Editor, the BOM structure 
for the fi le is being changed globally. To override a component’s BOM structure per 
instance, right-click it in the browser and choose BOM Structure; then select Reference.
Use positional reps and fl exible assemblies together.  Often, you may need to show a 
design in various stages of motion to test interference and/or proof of concept. Copying 
assemblies so that you can change the assembly relationships to show different assembly 
positions can become a fi le management nightmare. Instead, use fl exible subassemblies and 
positional representations.
Master It  You need to show your assembly in variations dependent on the position of 
the moving parts and the task the machine is accomplishing at given stages of its opera-
tion. How do you do this?
Solution  Leave subassemblies underconstrained if they have parts that determine their 
position based on the relationships with parts within another subassembly. Set them to 
Flexible to allow them to be mated to other parts and used in different positions within 
the same top-level assembly. Create positional representations to show the design in 
known kinematic states, such as fully opened, closed, opened at a given angle, and so on. 
As an added benefi t, animating assemblies in Inventor Studio is simple when positional 
representations have been set up in the model.
Copy assembly designs for reuse and confi guration.  Because of the live linked data that 
exists in Inventor assemblies, using Windows Explorer to copy designs and rename parts is 
diffi cult and often delivers poor results. Using the tool provided in Inventor will allow you to 
copy designs and maintain the links between fi les.
Master It  How do you duplicate an existing design to create a similar design?
Solution  Use the Copy Components feature in the assembly environment to copy 
designs and choose which parts to copy and rename, reuse, or omit from the new design. 
Use Autodesk Vault to take it to the next level and include all the 2D drawings in the 
copied design.
Substitute a single part for entire subassemblies.  Working with large assemblies, particu-
larly where large, complex assemblies are used over and over as subassemblies within a top-
level design, can tax almost any workstation if not approached in the correct manner.
Master It  You would like to swap out a complex assembly for a simplifi ed version for 
use in layout designs or to use in large assemblies in an attempt to improve performance. 
What is the best way to do that?
Solution  Create LOD representations to suppress components when not in use during 
the design cycle. Create single substitute parts from large complex assemblies to be used 
as subassemblies within the design. Enjoy the benefi ts of referencing fewer fi les while 
maintaining an accurate bill of materials.

CHAPTER 9: LARGE ASSEMBLY STRATEGIES | 953
Work with assembly design accelerators and generators.  Design accelerators and genera-
tors allow you to rapidly create complex geometry and the associated calculations that verify 
the viability of your design.
Master It  Your design needs a bolted connection, but you are not certain about the 
number of bolts to use to ensure a proper connection. How do you determine this?
Solution  Use the Bolted Connections tool to determine the optimum number of bolts 
for a given material and loading conditions.
Use design calculators.  Design calculators do not create any geometry, but they permit you 
to store the calculations in the assembly and repeat the calculation with different input val-
ues at a later time.
Master It  You need to calculate the size of a weld between two plates to withstand a 
certain lateral force. What tool do you use?
Solution  Use the Fillet Weld calculator to determine the size, type, and material of the 
weld bead.
Chapter 9: Large Assembly Strategies
Select a workstation.  Having the right tool for the job is the key to success in anything you 
do. This is true of selecting a large assembly workstation. You have learned that for optimal 
performance you should strive to keep your system working in physical memory (RAM).
Master It  You notice that your computer runs slowly when working with large assem-
blies, and you want to know whether you should consider a 64-bit system. How do you 
determine whether your system is adequate or whether it’s time to upgrade?
Solution  To decide whether your system is adequate, evaluate the amount of time 
you spend working on large assemblies and the percentage of that time you spend 
waiting on your workstation. Monitor your RAM usage, and decide whether upgrad-
ing to a 64-bit system is a good solution for your needs. You should plan for hardware 
upgrades in your budget to make them more manageable. Remember that if you have 
a system that was built in the last year or two, it may already be capable of running a 
64-bit operating system, so you may need to upgrade only the OS rather than replace 
the hardware.
Adjust your performance settings.  You have learned that there are many settings in 
Inventor and in Windows that you can use to confi gure the application to work more effi -
ciently with large assemblies.
Master It  You want to make your current workstation run as effi ciently as possible for 
large assembly design. What are some ways to do that?
Solution  Disable the unneeded Windows visual effects and discontinue the use of 
screen savers, large-resolution screen sizes, and desktop wallpapers. Learn the location of 
the Application Options settings within Inventor that will provide performance gains.
Use best practices for large assemblies.  Knowing the tools for general assembly design 
is only half of the battle when it comes to conquering large assemblies. Understanding the 
methods of large assembly design and how they differ from those for general assembly 
design is a key to success.

954 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  You want to create adaptive parts so that you can make changes during the 
initial design stage and have several parts update automatically as you work through the 
details. But you are concerned about how this will adversely affect your assembly perfor-
mance. How do you keep your performance level high in this situation?
Solution  Create adaptive relationships between parts as you normally would, but 
ensure that the adaptivity is turned off once the initial design is done. If the parts require 
an update, turn Adaptivity back on, make the edits, and then turn Adaptivity back off.
Manage assembly detail.  Inventor includes several tools to help manage assembly detail so 
that you can accomplish your large assembly design goals.
Master It  You want to reduce the number of fi les your large assembly is required to ref-
erence while you are working on it and yet maintain an accurate bill of materials. How do 
you do that?
Solution  Use substitute level of detail (LOD) representations to derive a subassembly 
into a single part fi le. Place multiple instances of the subassembly into the top-level as-
sembly at the substitute level of detail.
Simplify parts.  Creating highly detailed parts may be required for generating production 
drawings or Inventor Studio renderings, but using those high-detail parts in large assemblies 
may have an adverse effect on performance.
Master It  You want to create a lower-level-of-detail part fi le for common parts to be 
reused many times over in your large assemblies but are concerned about managing two 
versions of a part. How do you avoid versioning problems?
Solution  Create an embedded link between the two versions so that you can easily 
locate and access the other version if the fi rst version requires an edit.
Chapter 10: Weldment Design
Select and use the right weldment design methodology.  You’ve been shown three weld-
ment design methodologies. Before you start on any weldment design, it is imperative to 
keep the documentation, interference analysis, mass properties, and other design criteria in 
perspective and select the right design methodology.
Master It  How do you choose the right weldment strategy for you?
Solution  If you don’t need to document the weldment design stages, you could 
consider the part fi les and part features methodology or the weldment assembly and 
derived methodology. With the weldment assembly methodology, you get to document 
the different stages of weldment design and reap the benefi ts of any new enhancements. 
Talk to your machine shop and then choose the one that best suits you. Use the weldment 
assembly design methodology if you can’t decide.
Create and edit weld preparations and machining features.  Following the weldment 
methodology, you need to plan on creating the gaps needed (weld preparations) to deposit 
the weld beads. You need to create post-weldment machining features that go through the 
weld beads.
Master It  Weld preparations and machining features are similar to part model-
ing features. Based on the weld-bead shape needed, you should plan on creating the 

CHAPTER 10: WELDMENT DESIGN | 955
preparations in advance. Once the welds are done, you must create the features for the 
machining processes. Where can you fi nd preparation and machining features, and when 
do you use them?
Solution  Double-click the Preparations or Machining tool in the assembly browser to 
go into those environments. Chamfer and Move Face are most commonly used. Most 
groove welds require some kind of weld preparations.
Create and edit different kinds of weld beads, such as cosmetic, fi llet, and groove.  Weldment 
design involves the optimal mix of cosmetic and solid weld beads based on the requirements of 
your design goals and model verifi cation needs.
Master It  You should create the weld annotations only in drawings, without any need 
to create them in the model. You have weld subassemblies that need only lightweight rep-
resentation in both the model and drawings. In situations involving accurate interference 
and mass properties, you require accurate weld beads. The question is, what type of weld 
beads should you use?
Solution  Double-click Welds in the assembly browser and choose the desired weld 
bead type. For a lightweight representation with no interference and accurate mass prop-
erties, use cosmetic welds. For interference and accurate mass properties, use the solid 
representation. Use a combination of fi llet and groove welds as needed to generate the 
desired weld-bead shape. Use the split technique in cases where you want precise control. 
Observe that you can use a single weld symbol to call out multiple weld beads.
Document weldment stages in drawings.  Welds need to be documented in assemblies 
or drawings. It is important to show the different stages of weldment design in drawings to 
get a good idea of how to manufacture the weldment. You can use the drawing tools effec-
tively to annotate the welds in drawings. This will help the welder understand the design 
intent better.
Master It  Several tools are used for weld documentation. You can annotate the welds 
in assemblies. If you prefer to document the welds in drawings, you could document 
the four stages of weldment design: the as-assembled, as-prepped, as-welded, and 
as-machined stages in drawings. Name two other drawing tools that customize weld 
documentation.
Solution  While creating a drawing view on the Model State tab of the Drawing View 
dialog box, select Assembly, Machining, Welds, or Preparation. Use the End Fill tool to 
customize the weld-bead process shape. Weld Caterpillars is another useful tool to show 
welds in a drawing.
Generate and maintain a consistent BOM across welded assemblies, drawings, and 
presentations.  You have been shown how to generate and maintain a consistent bill of 
materials for weldment assemblies and a parts list in drawings. Mark parts or assemblies as 
inseparable to designate them as weldments.
Master It  How do you generate the BOM and parts list for your weldment?
Solution  You can generate the bill of materials and mark the components as 
inseparable. In the drawing, you generate the parts list for the weldment assembly. 
Click the BOM tool in a weldment assembly. In the Structure column, you can set each 
part to be inseparable. Use the Parts List tool and appropriate table-wrapping options to 
generate the parts list.

956 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Chapter 11: Presentations and Exploded Views
Create an exploded assembly view by creating a presentation.  Presentation fi les are used 
to virtually disassemble an assembly so downstream consumers can better visualize the 
design. The explosion created in the presentation fi le can be referenced in an assembly draw-
ing to complement nonexploded assembly views.
Master It  Your assembly design is complex and contains many internal components 
that can’t be visualized in traditional assembly drawing views. What is a good approach 
to showing those components?
Solution  Create a new presentation fi le, reference an assembly, and tweak parts and 
subassemblies away from their constrained positions. Add as many tweaks as necessary 
to communicate the design effectively. You may choose to create several explosions in one 
presentation fi le to achieve this goal.
Create basic linear tweaks.  Tweaks are used to move (or translate) components along a 
specifi ed axis. This allows you to pull your assembly apart in order to show how it goes 
together.
Master It  Your assembly design includes a number of hardware connections, and you’d 
like to show how they go together in a clear and concise way. How should you do this?
Solution  Creating linear tweaks in a presentation view can often show screw, washer, 
and nut stack-ups more clearly than they can be shown in an assembled view on a 
drawing.
Create rotational tweaks.  Rotational tweaks allow you to move components in an orienta-
tion that is not along the standard x-, y-, and z-axes and that can be used to show rotation of 
parts for animations.
Master It  Your assembly has a housing that you’d like to tip out of the way to show both 
the parts within and the connection features of the housing. When you apply a linear 
tweak, you can move the housing up and off the assembly to show the parts, but you can-
not see the connection features. What do you need to do to see the connection features?
Solution  You can use a rotational tweak to tip over the housing part and expose the 
underside to the view. Using linear and rotational tweaks together is often the best way 
to add clarity to your assembly presentation views.
Group, reorder, and animate tweaks.  Once tweaks are created, you may want to group 
several of them together into the same sequence of steps and reorder them to show a specifi c 
assembly step in an animation.
Master It  You want to create an animated assembly presentation of your assembly 
going together, but when creating the tweaks, you did so by going from top to bottom of 
the assembly rather than following the order in which the assembly would actually take 
place. Can this be resolved?
Solution  You can use the Group and Reorder tools to refi ne your presentation after 
it’s initially created. This is often helpful when you’ve created a presentation for the 

CHAPTER 12: DOCUMENTATION | 957
purposes of a 2D drawing view and didn’t consider the order in which tweaks were cre-
ated but then decide later to animate it.
Publish presentation fi les.  Although you can place views of your presentation fi le on a 2D 
drawing, it can be helpful to include the 3D animation for customers and colleagues in the 
form of a DWF or DWFx fi le.
Master It  You want to supply the shop fl oor with assembly instructions of your assem-
bly going together. What is a good way to do this?
Solution  You can output your presentation sequences as a lightweight DWF or DWFx 
fi le and then allow the people on the shop fl oor to use Autodesk Design Review or 
Internet Explorer to view the fi les. Using presentation fi les in this way can add a great 
deal of clarity to build procedures and assembly instructions.
Chapter 12: Documentation
Create templates and styles.  Inventor provides numerous methods to create, store, and 
use drawing templates and styles. Careful planning as to how and where to manage these 
resources is important. Consideration must be given to how templates are deployed on your 
network and whether to use the style library.
Master It  Rather than using one of the out-of-the-box drawing settings, you need to set 
up a drawing template, a drafting standard, and annotation styles to conform to a par-
ticular international, industry, or company drafting standard. How do you get started?
Solution  Use one of the drawing templates that are installed with Inventor, and recon-
fi gure it to meet your or your company’s requirements. Edit the drawing resources to 
customize your title block, border, and sketched symbols. Defi ne annotation styles such 
as dimension and parts list styles, and determine how best to share them across your 
workgroup.
Utilize drawing resources.  Each Inventor drawing fi le contains a number of commonly 
used drawing-resource defi nitions, such as title blocks, borders, symbols, and so on. These 
resource defi nitions allow you store preconfi gured items for quick and easy reuse.
Master It  You have blocks of general notes that you place on every drawing fi le. However, 
some drawings get one set of notes, and others get another, so making these notes part of 
the title block seems to be the wrong approach. Is there a way to handle this in Inventor? 
Solution  You can create a sketched symbol for each of the note blocks and type out 
the notes using the Text tool. Then when you create a new drawing fi le, you can choose 
which block of notes to place on the drawing and insert it from the Sketched Symbols 
folder in the Drawing Resources folder. 
Edit styles and standards.  Inventor’s drawing styles and standards allow you to set up 
your dimension styles, layer styles, and so on, in advance so that you can maintain consis-
tency across all of your drawings.

958 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  You have set up your object defaults to use an inch-based dimension style, but 
occasionally you want to place a millimeter-based dimension. Can this be done easily, or 
do you have to override the dimension style?
Solution  Typically, you will set up several dimension styles in your template fi le. In this 
case, you might have one for Imperial and another for metric dimensions. Although only one 
dimension style can be the default style that is selected when you start the Dimension tool, you 
can set the Dimension tool to use another style. To do this, fi rst start the Dimension tool, then 
go to the Format panel and select the styles pull-down, and choose a different dimension style 
from list. You can also select previously placed dimensions and change them to use a different 
style using the same pull-down.
Create drawing views.  Drawing views allow you to make 2D views of your 3D models. 
The hidden line generation and alignment of your projected views are automatic, as are 
updates to the 2D views when your 3D models change. 
Master It  When placing a drawing view, the lines on curved edges don’t show up. Is 
there an option to turn these on?
Solution  When placing a view or editing a view, you can click the Display Options tab. 
Here, you’ll fi nd several options to control the visibility of tangent edges, interference 
edges, thread lines, and many other optional display items.
Annotate part drawings.  Adding annotation to your part drawings is accomplished 
primarily using the tools found on the Annotate tab. Many of these tools automate tradi-
tional drafting annotation, but you might still fi nd the need to add annotation in a more 
manual way.
Master It  You need to create sheet-metal fl at patterns for your parts with laser etch-
ing on them. Often this is text, but you’ve noticed that if you attempt to create text as an 
extrusion on the part, you end up with a stencil effect, rather than single-line characters 
used for etching. Is there a way to do this?
Solution  There are a couple of methods for doing this, but the most common is accom-
plished by creating a sketch in the drawing environment. First you select the fl at pattern 
view, and then you click the Create Sketch button from the Annotate tab. By selecting 
the view fi rst, the sketch is associated to the view, and if the view is moved, the sketch 
will move also. To add the laser etching information, you can use the Text tool and select 
a font such as Simplex. You can also sketch lines and other geometry if needed. Using 
the Project Geometry tool lets you anchor and dimension your text and lines to the part 
edges for precise placement.
Annotate assembly drawings.  Often, much of the annotation created for assembly draw-
ings concerns bill of materials information, but you can use most of the same annotation 
tools used for part drawings in an assembly drawing.
Master It  You created a section view of your assembly model and then noticed that you 
could hide the hatch pattern by right-clicking it and choosing Hide. But now when you 
right-click the drawing view, you can’t fi nd an option to bring back the hatch pattern. Is 
it gone for good? 
Solution  To bring back a hidden hatch pattern, edit the view and click the Display 
Options tab. On this tab you’ll fi nd a Hatching check box. Select it and then your hatch 
pattern will be displayed again.

CHAPTER 13: TOOLS OVERVIEW | 959
Work with sheet-metal drawings.  Inventor sheet-metal drawings give you access to the 
folded model and the fl at pattern, provided that a fl at pattern has been created in the 3D model.
Master It  When you place a bend note on a fl at pattern drawing, it places the direction, 
angle, and bend radius. Your shop is accustomed to seeing only the direction and angle. 
Is there a way to remove the bend radius?
Solution  If you right-click a bend note and choose Edit Bend Note, you can remove the 
radius notation for that note. To do this for all of the bend notes on the sheet, right-click a 
bend note and choose Edit Dimension Style. This will take you to the Notes And Leaders 
tab of the edit dialog for the dimension style containing the bend note. Use the radio 
button near the top to select the Bend Note option, and then you can make changes that 
will update all of the bend notes.
Work with weldment views.  Weldment views offer some extra functionality over standard 
assembly views in that they allow you to document your assembly in each weldment stage.
Master It  You want to create a drawing package that shows all of the weldment pieces 
in the prepped stage and then show the weldment assembly in the completed form. 
What’s the best way to do this?
Solution  When you place a view of the weldment assembly, you can use the Model 
State tab of the view creation dialog box to choose each component of the weldment in 
the Preparation stage.
Work with iParts and iAssembly drawings.  One of the benefi ts of creating part and 
assembly families as iParts and iAssemblies is the ability to created tabulated drawings that 
show each member and its key dimensions in a table.
Master It  You’ve created an iPart table and want to set the dimension on the sheet to 
match the table heading. Is this possible?
Solution  You can do this by simply overriding the dimension value. First, edit the 
dimension and then select the Hide Dimension Value check box. Then, type in the table 
heading name.
Share your drawings outside your workgroup.  You can save your drawings in DWF, 
DWFx, and PDF formats in order to share them with people who do not have Inventor. You 
can use Autodesk Design Review to access DWF fi les and Adobe Acrobat Reader to access 
PDF fi les; both are free viewer applications.
Master It  You have a multipage Inventor drawing, but when you export it as a PDF fi le, 
you get only the fi rst page. Is this a bug, or is it just the way it is?
Solution  When you export a drawing as a PDF, you will be presented with the Save 
Copy As dialog box. In this dialog box, there is an Options button; if you click this but-
ton, you’ll fi nd an option to include all drawing sheets.
Chapter 13: Tools Overview
Take your models from Inventor to the Autodesk Building Systems (ABS) program.  If 
you frequently need to take your Inventor models to ABS, BIM Exchange can help you in this 
process with three simple steps. Inventor provides a variety of ways to simplify the model 
and author it. Such models can be published in ABS.

960 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  Describe the basic steps involved in moving Inventor models to Autodesk 
Building Systems.
Solution  You can do this with the following three steps: model simplifying, authoring, 
and publishing. Author the model with cables, conduit, ducts, or pipe. Create part fami-
lies and catalogs.
Create AutoLimits (design sensors).  You use AutoLimits to monitor design parameters in 
which you are interested.
Master It  You want to use AutoLimits for every dimension in your model. How many 
AutoLimits can you use at once?
Solution  Create the AutoLimits and set up their boundaries. Although technically 
the number of AutoLimits you can use in your model is unlimited, you should consider 
limiting the number of AutoLimits to around 10 to avoid impacting the performance of 
your model.
Manage design data effi ciently using Inventor tools.  There are different tools for manag-
ing design data, which is typically distributed across part, assembly, and drawing fi les. You 
can associate Excel spreadsheets, text fi les, Word documents, and so on, with these tools.
Master It  Name some of the Inventor tools for managing design data. Describe what 
each one does and how to initiate it.
Solution  The Design Assistant keeps the fi le relationships while copying, renaming, 
and moving fi les. Whenever you are sending Inventor fi les to others, use Pack And Go, 
which hunts down the fi le relationship for you, and then you can package them into a 
single ZIP fi le. You can delegate many of the tasks in Inventor to the Task Scheduler. You 
can propagate source drawing template information to several destination drawings 
using the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard. In the Design Assistant, click the Manage 
button. Right-click the fi le in the Action column and select Action. Right-click the fi le in 
the Name column and select Change Name. Click Save Changes. Right-click the fi le in 
Windows Explorer to use Pack And Go. In the Task Scheduler, use the Create Task menu 
to create your task. In the Drawing Resource Transfer Wizard, select source resources, 
deselect any unwanted resources, and propagate the template information to destination 
drawings.
Manage styles.  You can use the Style Library Manager to organize your styles to keep them 
simple and clean.
Master It  Styles normally need to be copied, edited, and deleted. How do you manage 
your styles? How can you create a central repository of styles?
Solution  You can create a new style library using the Create New Style Library button 
in the Style Library Manager. You can copy styles by clicking Style Library 1 and then 
clicking Style Library 2. To delete styles, right-click the style in the Style Library Manager 
and then rename or delete the style.
Create expressions with iProperties.  Property fi elds can be concatenated to produce 
desired customized information in BOM and parts lists. For example, you can break down 
your parts by stock size to be used in your BOM with associativity to model parameters.
Master It  How do you create and manage expressions for iProperties?

CHAPTER 14: EXCHANGING DATA WITH OTHER SYSTEMS | 961
Solution  You can create expressions on the Summary, Project, Status, or Custom tab. 
Start with the = sign and type in the text. To include parameters or iProperty names, 
include them in brackets. A detected expression is denoted by fx. You can create a tem-
plate fi le with predefi ned expressions for iProperties to unify your parts list and other 
documentation.
Give feedback to Autodesk.  You can participate in the Customer Involvement Program (CIP). 
Customer error reporting (CER) helps Autodesk know about any issue you might experience.
Master It  You have a repeatable crash that you suspect is related to a specifi c fi le or a 
specifi c machine and want to know whether Autodesk can help you determine this.
Solution  You can use the CER form to supply contact information and step-by-step 
information about repeatable issues and then call reseller support or log a case with 
Autodesk through the subscription website. Autodesk can look up your CER based on the 
submittal time and contact information you entered.
Chapter 14: Exchanging Data with Other Systems
Import and export geometry.  In the design world today, you most likely need to transfer 
fi les to or from a customer or vendor from time to time. Chances are, the fi les will need to be 
translated to or from a neutral fi le format to be read by different CAD packages.
Master It  You are collaborating with another design offi ce that does not use Inventor. 
You are asked which you would prefer, IGES or STEP fi les. Which one should you request?
Solution  Request a STEP fi le over IGES when you have the choice. Take advantage of 
the extra intelligence related to assembly structure and fi lenames that can be retained in 
the STEP fi le format.
Use Inventor fi le translators.  Inventor offers native fi le translators for CATIA, Pro/ENGINEER, 
SolidWorks, Unigraphics, and other CAD fi le types. This allows you to access these fi le formats 
with Inventor and translate the fi les into Inventor fi les directly.
Master It  You are a “job shop” and in the past have been required to maintain a copy 
of SolidWorks in addition to your copy of Inventor to work with customers who send 
you SolidWorks fi les. You would like to eliminate the cost of maintaining two software 
packages. What is a good strategy for doing that?
Solution  Use Inventor to access the customer’s fi les directly and convert them to 
Inventor fi les for your in-house use. Use Save Copy As to export the fi le back out as a 
SolidWorks fi le to send to the client for review. In this way, you may be able to eliminate 
the need to maintain two software packages.
Work with imported data.  Using the construction environment in Inventor, you can repair 
poorly translated surface fi les. Often, a fi le fails to translate into a solid because of just a few 
translation errors in the part. Repairing or patching the surfaces and promoting the fi le to a 
solid allows you to use the fi le more effectively.
Master It  You download an IGES fi le from a vendor website, but when you attempt to 
use the component in your design, the surface data is found to have issues. How should 
you proceed?

962 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Solution  Open the fi le and copy the surfaces to the construction environment. Use 
Stitch Surface to create composite surfaces, and identify the gaps in the surface data. Use 
the construction tools to delete, patch, and extend surfaces in order to close the gaps and 
promote the data to a solid. Before getting started on this, evaluate the amount of time 
required to repair the surface data. You may fi nd that you can model the vendor compo-
nent—by using catalog specs or by measuring an actual part—faster than you can repair 
some surface models.
Work with Design Review markups.  Design Review offers you and the people who col-
laborate with you an easy-to-use electronic markup tool that can be round-tripped from 
Inventor. Design Review markups can be made on both 2D and 3D fi les.
Master It  You want to use Design Review to communicate with vendors and clients 
to save time and resources, but you have found that others are unsure of what Design 
Review is and how to get it. What are some good ways to help others begin to use this 
handy application?
Solution  Suggest using Design Review to the people you collaborate with and mention 
to them that this application is a free download. Send them the link to download the 
application and the online demonstration found in Design Review’s Help menu. Continue 
to offer your collaborators the review material in PDF, DWG, or any other traditional fi le 
type in case they end up in a time crunch, but send them DWF fi les as well. If they use 
Internet Explorer 7, consider sending them DWFx fi les, and mention to them that they can 
open those fi les directly in their web browser.
Chapter 15: Frame Generator
Work with frame fi les.  Frame Generator puts all the members at the same level in the 
assembly.
Master It  You have a frame that is built up in sections that are welded together. How do 
you document the manufacturing process?
Solution  Use Demote to create subassemblies of frame members. Select the frame 
members in the browser. From the context menu, select Component and then Demote 
Frame Generator Components. This preserves the Frame Generator relationships.
Insert frame members onto a skeleton model.  Frame Generator builds a skeleton model 
for the frame from the selected lines and edges.
Master It  Since Frame Generator builds its own skeleton model, you don’t have to build 
a master model before you start creating the frame. What would you reference in your 
assembly to use as a frame skeleton?
Solution  Use layout sketches and surfaces to design the basic frame shape. Position the 
components that will be mounted to the frame in the assembly and reference edges on 
the parts. As you make changes to the assembly, such as the overall size or the position of 
components, the frame will automatically update.
Add end treatments to frame members.  Frame Generator does not support end treatments 
on merged members.

CHAPTER 16: INVENTOR STUDIO | 963
Master It  Let’s assume you are building a stairway and the handrail has curved sections. 
How would you approach the curved handrail so that its ends can be treated?
Solution  You can handle this situation in several ways:
 
◆
When you create the frame member, don’t select the Merge option. This creates indi-
vidual fi les for each segment. You can add end treatments to the end segments and 
document the details in the assembly drawing.
 
◆
Create the sketches so the ends of the curved member terminate at the face of another 
member. If the mating member has a fl at face, you don’t need an end treatment.
 
◆
Add short linear segments that aren’t merged with the rest of the curved mem-
ber. You can document that the length of the curved member does not include end 
treatments.
 
◆
Manually create end treatments using part-modeling commands. Frame members are 
created as custom parts that can be edited.
Make changes to frames.  Inventor provides detailed frame-member information.
Master It  You need to determine the size and wall thickness of the tubing and make it 
either thicker or larger. How do you do that?
Solution  Use the Frame Member Info tool to get the properties for the frame members. 
Then, you can use the Change tool to increase the wall thickness, increase the size, or 
select a different structural profi le.
Author and publish structural profi les.  Frame Generator uses structural shapes from 
Content Center.
Master It  How would you add custom aluminum extrusions to Content Center so 
Frame Generator can access them?
Solution  Use the Structural Shape Authoring tool to prepare the parts for publishing. 
Use the Publish Part tool to add the parts to Content Center.
Create BOMs for Frame Generator assemblies.  Frame Generator has special parameters 
for frame members.
Master It  How do you add the profi le dimensions and the length of your frame mem-
bers to the Description fi eld?
Solution  Use the BOM expression builder to add the Stock Number and G_L parameters 
to the Description fi eld.
Chapter 16: Inventor Studio
Create and animate cameras.  Although static camera animations are a common part of any 
animation, by creating and animating cameras you give your renderings a much more pro-
fessional feel.
Master It  You know that the most expedient means of capturing camera keyframe posi-
tions is to create a camera and animate it. How do you do this?

964 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Solution  To create a new camera, do the following:
 1. Use the view orientation tools to position the view to show what the camera would 
see in the fi rst frame.
 2. Right-click and select Create Camera From View.
To animate the camera, do the following:
 1. In the Animation Timeline window, select the new camera by name in the drop-
down list.
 2. In the Animation Timeline window, set the time slider to the time position repre-
senting when you want the camera to be in another location.
 3. In the Scene browser, right-click the new camera node and click Animate Camera.
 4. In the graphics region, use the View Orientation tools to position the view to show 
what you want at that time position.
 5. In the Animation Timeline window, click Add Camera Action.
Repeat as needed.
Start new animations, modify animations, and use the various animation tools.  Animating 
your assemblies so that the function of the mechanism is showcased is often the purpose of an 
assembly animation.
Master It  You have an existing animation but want to do a variation on it. How do you 
copy and edit an existing animation?
Solution  Copy the animation:
 1. In the Scene browser, expand the Animations node.
 2. Right-click the animation for which you want to make a variation and click Copy 
Animation.
 3. Right-click the Animations folder and click Paste Animation. The Animations 
folder populates a new animation based on the selected animation.
Modify the animation:
 1. Right-click the new animation and click Activate.
 2. In the Animation Timeline window, make modifi cations to actions as needed.
 3. Add new actions as needed using the animation commands.
Use multiple cameras to create a video production of your animation.  Video Producer 
provides the means to combine camera shots into a single video output.
Master It  You have created several cameras, animated and static, and want to make a 
composite animation. What are the general steps you will follow?
Solution  Do the following:
 1. In the Scene browser, expand the Productions node.
 2. If no production exists, right-click the Productions node and click New Production.

CHAPTER 16: INVENTOR STUDIO | 965
 3. The cameras are loaded into the Video Producer window and are ready for use.
 4. Drag and drop shots into the timeline and set their parameters.
 5. Drag and drop the desired transitions between the shots.
Use props to enhance your scene.  Inventor assemblies can be combined with other compo-
nents to create a more realistic scene for rendering.
Master It  You have completed a design and want to render a realistic image of it in its 
working environment. How do you do this?
Solution  Do the following:
 1. Create a new assembly that will be used as a wrapper assembly.
 2. Place your product assembly in the new assembly.
 3. Add any props, other parts, and other assemblies that make the scene more realistic.
Render shaded and illustrative images.  Inventor provides the means to render both 
shaded and illustrative images.
Master It  With your new product nearing completion, the marketing department has 
asked for rendered images for marketing collateral and technical documents such as 
white papers. What are the general steps for both realistic and illustration rendering?
Solution  To create a realistic rendering, do the following:
 1. Prepare the scene with what you want to render.
 2. Click the Render Image command.
 3. In the Render Image dialog box, select Realistic as the render type.
 4. Specify the camera, lighting, and scene styles to use.
 5. Click Render.
To create an illustration rendering, do the following:
 1. Prepare the scene with what you want to render.
 2. Click the Render Image command.
 3. In the Render Image dialog box, select Illustration as the render type.
 4. Specify the camera, lighting, and scene styles to use.
 5. On the Style tab, specify the appropriate settings for your rendering.
 6. Click Render.
Render animations and video productions.  Inventor provides the means to render anima-
tions and video productions.
Master It  You’ve created a wrapper assembly and set up the scene with cameras, light-
ing, and a scene style. Now you want to render an animation for design review and ren-
der a video production for a multidisciplinary review or marketing. What are the basic 
steps in each process?

966 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Solution  To render the animation, do the following:
 1. In the Scene browser, select and activate the animation you want to render.
 2. Deactivate any active production. Remember, when a production is active, it 
is the render target. To render a single animation, you must deactivate any 
active production.
 3. In the Inventor Studio tool panel, click Render Animation.
 4. Specify the various styles to use and the render type.
 5. Specify the output fi le type and other parameters.
 6. Render the animation.
To render a production, do the following:
 1. In the Scene browser, select and activate the production you want to render.
 2. If you have not completed composing the production, you should do so.
 3. In the Inventor Studio tool panel, click Render Animation.
 4. Specify the various styles to use and the render type.
 5. Specify the output fi le type and other parameters.
 6. Render the animation.
Chapter 17: Stress Analysis and Dynamic Simulation
Set up and run Stress Analysis simulations.  Oftentimes you may fi nd yourself guessing at 
what impact a change to your design might have on the strength and overall integrity of your 
part. Questions such as “Can I make this part a bit lighter?” or “Can I move this cutout closer 
to the edge?” become important to the success of your design.
Master It  Set up a parameter study in your model to explore the consequences of edit-
ing features and their locations. Nominate all the crucial parameters to the table and then 
create the confi guration simulations for all of the combinations.
Solution  Interpret the results of the parameter study, looking for the confi guration 
that promises to exhibit the results that come closest to your goals, such as a target 
safety factor. Examine the various confi gurations to see which ones would be considered 
underbuilt and overbuilt and then determine why. Understanding what works and 
doesn’t work will allow you to get closer to the target from the beginning of the design 
process next time.
Set up and run Dynamic Simulations.  When you fi nd yourself working out the details of 
a design with many moving parts, consider using the Dynamic Simulation tools early in the 
process to prove what will or will not work before going forward.
Master It  Even before the assembly is complete, switch to the Dynamic Simulation 
environment and create assembly relationships in the simulation. Test the motion as you 
build the parts, and attempt to understand how contact will occur from the beginning.

CHAPTER 18: ROUTED SYSTEMS | 967
Solution  Enable the automatic Assembly constraint option so that as you create rela-
tionships, standard joints are automatically created. Use the Input Grapher to design in 
the fourth dimension (time), understanding how a mechanism will or will not work as 
you go through the stages of its operation.
Export results from the Dynamic Simulation environment to the Stress Analysis 
environment.  Often when setting up a stress analysis simulation, you are guessing at what 
the loads might be, based on rough calculations. As you make changes to the design, those 
calculations become out-of-date and therefore invalid.
Master It  How do you use the Dynamic Simulation tools to determine the force exerted 
on one part by another?
Solution  Export the FEA information for the crucial time steps from the Dynamic 
Simulation environment into the Stress Analysis environment, and run the simulation. 
This helps keep your calculations both accurate and up-to-date. When the parts are 
modifi ed, the load calculations will automatically update based on the mass properties.
Chapter 18: Routed Systems
Create routes and runs.  Using routed systems tools allows you to quickly defi ne many dif-
ferent route types in order to check for clearance and fi ts within a design, all while creating a 
bill of materials that can be used downstream in the manufacturing process.
Master It  You have a model containing equipment and structural components defi ning 
the space requirements for a new route. Can you create a route using this geometry, or are 
you required to create a sketch fi rst? 
Solution  When you have geometry that needs to be referenced and routed around, you 
can create a sketch fi rst, but it isn’t required. Instead, you could use the orthogonal route 
tool to defi ne the route. 
Author a tube and pipe component.  To create your own fi ttings, couplings, and so on to 
be used within tube and pipe design, you need to fi rst author them for use with the tube and 
pipe tools.
Master It  How can you set the depth at which pipe, tube, or hose segments are inserted 
into a fi tting?
Solution  The pipe engagement is set during the tube and pipe component authoring 
process to determine how deep the segment will fi t into the fi tting. For butt weld–style 
components, the engagement is set to 0 since there is no insertion. Content Center 
components have the engagement positioning already set.
Author an electrical component.  To create your own electrical connector components to be 
used within cable and harness designs, you need to fi rst defi ne pins within the parts.
Master It  How can you create a family of electrical connectors with varying numbers 
of pins?
Solution  First, use the Place Pin or Place Pin Group tool to add the maximum number 
of pins to the connector part. Then convert the part to an iPart. In the iPart Author dialog 
box, use the Work Features tab to include only the pins required for each pin variation.

968 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Create and document cable and harness assemblies.  Cable and harness assemblies are 
created using a specifi c subassembly and part structure. Each harness is contained in a 
harness subassembly, and the parts such as wires, cables, and segments are created within a 
harness part fi le.
Master It  You have a complex design that includes many harness assemblies and would 
like to turn some of them off while you work on others and/or create new ones. What is 
the best way to do this?
Solution  You can create level-of-detail representations in cable and harness assemblies 
in much the same way that you would in a standard assembly. You can suppress an entire 
harness assembly and the harness part. But you cannot suppress other harness objects 
within the harness. Harness objects do not include connectors that are within the harness 
assembly. These can be suppressed.
Chapter 19: Plastics Design Features
Create thicken/offset features.  When creating plastic parts, you will often fi nd that work-
ing with surfaces allows you to achieve more free-form shapes than working with solids. 
Once the surfaces are created, you’ll need to give them a thin wall thickness.
Master It  How would you create a plastic part fi le with many curved, free-form 
elements?
Solution  You can use the extrude and revolve features, among others, to create sur-
face shapes that are much more free-form than what you can generally create with solid 
features. Once the surfaces are created, use the Thicken/Offset tool to give them a wall 
thickness.
Create shell features.  Shelling solids parts and features is a common way to create base 
features for plastic parts. Once the shell feature is created, other features can be added to it.
Master It  You want to create a shell feature but need to have some faces be thicker than 
the rest. How would you accomplish this?
Solution  You can use the >> button to expand the Unique Thickness option in the Shell 
tool dialog box to specify faces that require unique face thicknesses. Or you can use the 
Thicken/Offset tool to change the thickness of faces after a shell is created.
Create split features.  Many times you may want to establish the overall shape of a feature 
and then divide the shape into separate parts of the overall design. You can use the Split tool 
to do just that and more.
Master It  You have a plastic part that needs to have a raised face for a rubber grip 
applied during the manufacturing process. How would this be done?
Solution  Use the Split tool to create a surface that is unique to the rubber grip area and 
then use the Thicken/Offset tool to build up the rubber face.
Create grill features.  Grill features allow the infl ow or outfl ow of air through a plastic 
thin-wall part. Grills can be created with a number of subfeatures such as islands, ribs, and 
spars, but only the outer profi le of the grill is required.

CHAPTER 19: PLASTICS DESIGN FEATURES | 969
Master It  How would you determine the area of a grill opening based on the airfl ow it 
needs to handle?
Solution  Edit the sketch from which the grill feature was created and then use the 
Measure Region tool to determine the general area of the opening. Or create a sketch 
on the grill; project all of the islands, ribs, and spars into the sketch; and then use the 
Measure Region tool on it to determine the exact area of the opening.
Create rule fi llet features.  Rule fi llets can be an extremely effi cient way to apply fi llets 
throughout the design to many edges that meet the same rule criteria.
Master It  How would you apply fi llets to all of the edges that are generated by extrud-
ing a shape down to an existing set of base features?
Solution  Use the Rule Fillet tool with the source set to the new extruded shape, the rule 
set to Against Features, and the scope set to include all the base features to create inter-
secting fi llets. If this feature changes to create new edges or remove existing edges that fi t 
the rule, the fi llets are added or removed automatically.
Create rest features.  Rest features can be used to create level platform faces for mounting 
other parts to an irregular plastic part face.
Master It  You want to create a rectangular pocket on the inside of a plastic housing to 
hold an electronic component. How would you do this?
Solution  On a work plane, create a sketch that defi nes the shape of the pocket. The work 
plane location will defi ne the orientation. Use the Rest tool to create the pocket, using the 
options in the Rest tool to achieve the exact result you require.
Create boss features.  Boss features are ideal for creating fastener-mounting standoffs for 
thin-wall plastic parts. You can use the Boss tool to create both halves of the fastener boss.
Master It  You want to create multiple boss features around the perimeter of a fl at, pan-
type base part, but you know this base part is likely to change size. How would you set 
up the boss features to adjust to the anticipated edits?
Solution  On a work plane, create a 2D sketch that defi nes the height of the bosses. Use 
the Offset tool in the sketch environment to create an offset loop based on the perimeter 
of the part. Add sketch center points at all the required locations. Ensure that the offset 
loop and the sketch center points are fully constrained and dimensioned and then use 
these points when creating the boss feature.
Create lip and groove features.  When designing plastic parts, you may need one half of a 
design to fi t into the other half. The Lip tool allows you to create both lip and groove features 
for these situations.
Master It  You want to create a groove around the edge of an irregular, curved edge. 
How can you ensure that the lip on the corresponding part will match?
Solution  Use the clearance height to remove uneven mating surfaces during the lip and 
groove creation, ensuring a proper fi t.
Create snap fi t features.  Snap features are a common way to join plastic parts together so 
that they can be disassembled as needed. You can use the Snap Fit tool in Inventor to quickly 
create these features.

970 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  How would you create a U-shaped snap fi t with the Snap Fit tool?
Solution  Use the standard sketch and extrude methods to create the base of the 
U-shape. Then use the Snap Fit tool to add the snap and loop as needed.
Create rib and web features.  Ribs and webs are often used to add rigidity and prevent 
warping during the design of plastic parts. You can add ribs based on open profi le sketches 
in Inventor.
Master It  How would you create a network of ribs that are evenly spaced, with some of 
them containing different cutouts than others?
Solution  Create an open profi le sketch for the fi rst single rib. Then use the Rib tool to 
create it. Use the Rectangular Pattern tool to pattern the rib as needed and then create the 
cutout profi le and use the Extrude tool to cut the shape from the fi rst rib. Then pattern 
the cutout to match the rib pattern. Finally, suppress the cutouts you do not need.
Create draft features.  Because plastic parts must be extracted from a mold during the 
manufacturing process, drafted faces must be included to ensure that the parts can indeed be 
extracted from the mold.
Master It  You want to create drafted faces on a complex part containing various shapes 
within it. How would you do this?
Solution  Start the Draft tool and then click the Help button in the lower-left corner, 
or just press F1 on the keyboard. This will open the help page specifi cally for the Draft 
tool. Expand the nodes on the Concept tab to explore the examples of the various results 
achieved by different settings. Use the various methods throughout the part where they 
will provide the correct result. Set up work planes to help establish fi xed-plane faces.
Create an injection mold.  To generate the components you have designed with the plastic 
part features, you need to properly defi ne the cavity to create the part and defi ne how the 
material will fl ow into the cavity.
Master It  You want to create a mold base design in an effi cient manner using parts that 
can be purchased.
Solution  Use the many steps of the Inventor Tooling package to properly defi ne the core 
and cavity. Then use the analysis tools to ensure that the part will be made correctly. Finally, 
use the library of features included with Inventor to construct the mold base assembly.
Chapter 20: iLogic
Create iLogic rules.  Use iLogic rules to document and embed into your models the com-
mon design rules that you use every day to determine the decisions required in your design 
process.
Master It  How can you add a rule to your part to change the size of it?
Solution  Create a rule and use a parameter function to get and set the model 
parameters.
Edit iLogic rules.  A large part of working with iLogic is testing and editing the rules you 
create. Often, it’s best to add a function at a time to the rule and test it along the way.

CHAPTER 20: ILOGIC | 971
Master It  Your rule works, but you have to manually update the model. Do you need to 
create a new rule to handle the update?
Solution  You can edit your existing rule and add the UpdateWhenDone document 
function to run at the end of the rule.
Use multi-value list parameters.  A common part of any design rule process is selecting 
from a list of standard entities. You can create multi-value list parameters from Numeric or 
Text parameters to add lists.
Master It  How would you create a rule that prompts you to select from a list of 
approved sizes?
Solution  To start, you will create a user parameter and then make it a multi-value list 
parameter. Then you can use the InputListBox function or create an iLogic form to refer-
ence that list.
Work with multiple rules in the same fi le.  It is often best to create several small rules 
rather than try to create one large rule that does it all. This helps you maintain and trouble-
shoot the code later, and it also allows you to use rules in multiple applications without the 
need to remove or edit existing code. This is particularly true when working with external 
rules, which might be used in varying applications later.
Master It  You’ve created two smaller rules because it makes sense to do so, but when 
you try to run one, the other is triggered also. Do you need to combine them into one 
rule?
Solution  When one rule updates the parameters another rule is referencing, the other 
rule is triggered by that update by default. To resolve this, you can choose to edit the rule. 
Select the Options tab and then select the Don’t Run Automatically option. This prevents 
the rule from running automatically when the parameters are updated.
Use conditional statements.  Conditional statements are the foundation of any pro-
grammed logic. Learning how to use If, Then, and Select Case statements will go a long 
way in helping you solve logical problems when creating rules.
Master It  How can you check the value of a parameter or its state with an iLogic rule?
Solution  You can do this with an If, Then statement. For instance, if you want to check 
a parameter to ensure that it is not too small, you would use function operator such as 
< (less than) or <= (less than or equal to).
Suppress features.  Confi guring a part fi le to include and exclude features is often based on 
engineering decisions you make every day. Setting up your iLogic rules to do this is straight-
forward, provided the model is well constructed to start with.
Master It  When you use the Feature.IsActive function on one feature, it causes an 
error in the part. How can a feature be suppressed without suppressing a dependent 
feature?
Solution  Oftentimes, the issue is the use of projected geometry in the sketch of the 
dependent feature. Other times, the part was simply modeled in a manner that prevents 
suppressing a base feature. In these cases, it’s best just to edit the part and redefi ne the 
base feature so that it is based on the origin geometry and not on unrelated features.

972 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Work with iProperties.  iProperties are a powerful part of working with Inventor. Being 
able to retrieve and use metadata helps with all parts of the engineering process. Automating 
the process of fi lling out iProperty data with iLogic is a big step forward.
Master It  Can iLogic be used to update the title block of a drawing?
Solution  If you set the title block up to read the iProperties of the model and/or the 
drawing, then an iLogic rule created to write to those properties will automatically 
update the title block.
Create iLogic forms.  iLogic forms make creating a user interface for your iLogic pursuits 
quite easy. The drag-and-drop tools provide professional-looking forms with minimal effort.
Master It  You have existing part fi les with no iLogic in them, and it would be nice to 
use the form you created in the most recent design to update those old designs as revi-
sions require it. Can forms be created and shared across part fi les?
Solution  You can create an external global form and then use it in the future when you 
need to revise old designs of the same type.
Build a part confi guration form.  Confi guring Inventor components saves time, reduces 
human error, and promotes consistency. Using iLogic forms to confi gure common designs is 
a good way to go.
Master It  Can an iLogic form help with parts that are basically the same but have a lot 
of variation in the features they include?
Solution  Although you can’t access the active status of the features directly, you can use 
rules to determine when a feature should be included or excluded and then use the rules 
in the form.
