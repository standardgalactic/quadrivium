About the Author
Mark L. Chambers has been an author, computer consultant, BBS sysop, 
programmer, and hardware technician for more than 25 years — pushing 
computers and their uses far beyond “normal” performance limits for 
decades now. His fi rst love affair with a computer peripheral blossomed in 
1984 when he bought his lightning-fast 300 BPS modem for his Atari 400. Now 
he spends entirely too much time on the Internet and drinks far too much 
caffeine-laden soda.
With a degree in journalism and creative writing from Louisiana State 
University, Mark took the logical career choice: programming computers. 
However, after fi ve years as a COBOL programmer for a hospital system, 
he decided there must be a better way to earn a living, and he became 
the Documentation Manager for Datastorm Technologies, a well-known 
communications software developer. Somewhere in between writing software 
manuals, Mark began writing computer how-to books. His fi rst book, Running 
a Perfect BBS, was published in 1994 — and after a short fi fteen years of fun 
(disguised as hard work), Mark is one of the most productive and best-selling 
technology authors on the planet.
Along with writing several books a year and editing whatever his publishers 
throw at him, Mark has also branched out into Web-based education, 
designing and teaching a number of online classes — called WebClinics — 
for Hewlett-Packard.
His favorite pastimes include collecting gargoyles, watching St. Louis 
Cardinals baseball, playing his three pinball machines and the latest computer 
games, supercharging computers, and rendering 3D fl ights of fancy with 
TrueSpace — and during all that, he listens to just about every type of 
music imaginable. Mark’s worldwide Internet radio station, MLC Radio (at 
www.mlcbooks.com), plays only CD-quality classics from 1970 to 1979, 
including everything from Rush to Billy Joel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Mark’s rapidly expanding list of books includes MacBook For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition; Mac OS X Snow Leopard All-in-One For Dummies; Macs for Seniors For 
Dummies; iMac For Dummies, 5th Edition; Build Your Own PC Do-It-Yourself 
For Dummies; Building a PC For Dummies, 5th Edition; Scanners For Dummies, 
2nd Edition; CD & DVD Recording For Dummies, 2nd Edition; PCs All-in-One 
Desk Reference For Dummies, 4th Edition; Mac OS X Tiger: Top 100 Simpliﬁ ed 
Tips & Tricks; Microsoft Ofﬁ ce v. X Power User’s Guide; BURN IT! Creating Your 
Own Great DVDs and CDs; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Printer Handbook; The 
Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial Recordable CD Handbook; The Hewlett-Packard Ofﬁ cial 
Digital Photography Handbook; Computer Gamer’s Bible; Recordable CD Bible; 
Teach Yourself the iMac Visually; Running a Perfect BBS; Ofﬁ cial Netscape 
Guide to Web Animation; and Windows 98 Troubleshooting and Optimizing 
Little Black Book.

His books have been translated into 15 different languages so far — his 
favorites are German, Polish, Dutch, and French. Although he can’t read 
them, he enjoys the pictures a great deal.
Mark welcomes all comments about his books. You can reach him at 
mark@mlcbooks.com, or visit MLC Books Online, his Web site, at

Dedication
This book is dedicated with all my love to my aunt and uncle, Ruby and 
Tuffy Chambers, and their masterpiece:  the grand mansion that is the White 
Elephant!
Author’s Acknowledgments
Yes, I’ve written yet another Macintosh book — but this title is another in 
the hefty All-in-One series, which demands more work from everyone at 
Wiley Publishing! Now that the tome is ready for the shelves, I’d like to thank 
everyone who pitched in to make this project such a success.
As with all my books, I’d like to fi rst thank my wife, Anne; and my children, 
Erin, Chelsea, and Rose, for their support and love — and for letting me 
follow my dream!
The Composition Services team is in charge of the fi gures, artwork and layout 
for each of my books — they turn a plain document into printed pages that 
are informative, easy to read, and attractive! Thanks to each of the team 
members for a beautiful book.
Next, I again send my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to my superb 
technical editor Dennis Cohen, who once again took on the challenge of 
checking the technical accuracy of every word contained herein! His 
comprehensive knowledge of everything Apple (including the beta features 
tucked into the crannies of Snow Leopard) was invaluable throughout.
Finally, hats off to my project editor Susan Christophersen, who patiently 
managed the entire title from beginning to end, and my acquisitions editor 
Bob Woerner, who once again provided guidance throughout. Folks like 
Susan and Bob are the perfect example of why I’m proud (and lucky) to call 
Wiley my publisher!

How This Book Is Organized

If I mention a specific message that you see on your screen, it looks like this 
on the page: This is a message displayed by an application.
In case you’re curious about computers
No one expects a book in the For Dummies series to contain techno-jargon 
or ridiculous computer science semantics — especially a book about the 
MacBook! (Horrible pun unavoidable.) Apple has always strived for simplicity 
and user friendliness. I hereby promise that I’ve done my absolute best to 
avoid unnecessary techno-talk. For those who are interested in what’s 
happening under the hood, I provide sidebars that explain a little more 
about what’s doing what to whom. If you’d rather just have fun and ignore 
the digital dirty work, please feel free to disregard these additions (but don’t 
tear sidebars out of the book, because there’s likely to be important stuff on 
the opposite side of the page).
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve done my best to emulate the elegant design of your laptop by organizing 
this book into nine minibooks, with cross-references where appropriate.
Book I: Say Hello to Your MacBook
This minibook is an introduction to your Mac laptop — even if you need a 
little convincing about actually buying a new MacBook! I compare desktop 
Macs to the MacBook line and provide you with a hardware overview of just 
what exactly resides beneath your MacBook’s sleek exterior. If you’re 
comparing the different MacBook models before deciding on which to buy, 
you’ll find the chapter that discusses each of the three MacBook models 
useful. Also in this minibook, I provide tips on unpacking and setting up your 
new laptop and a guide to maintaining your MacBook in tip-top shape. You’ll 
also find a chapter on additional stuff that most MacBook owners covet. 
(You can even buy most of it before Apple ships your new Mac!) 
Book II: Using Mac OS X with Your MacBook
This minibook begins with an invigorating chapter explaining exactly 
why you should be so happy to be a Mac OS X owner. Then I provide an 
introduction to the basic tasks that you’ll perform — copying files, running 
programs, and the like. You also find coverage of Snow Leopard’s Spotlight 
search engine, tips on using your MacBook’s built-in camera, a guide to 
normal Mac OS X maintenance and troubleshooting, and instructions on 
using the Mac OS X Help system.

Introduction
D
o you feel it, too? The lure of freedom? The open road?
Since the early days of the so-called “portable” computer — which was 
easily the size of a modern carry-on suitcase — some computer owners 
have lived the mobile lifestyle. Back then, a mobile computer was generally 
considered to be too expensive, with far fewer features than a desktop 
computer. Only those business travelers and on-site professionals that 
really needed a mobile computer would possibly buy one, and they’d pay 
top dollar for it. The mantra was simple: a real computer is tied to your 
desk; a portable computer is practically a toy.
Those portable computers were just the beginning, of course — today’s 
laptops are easily carried to a coffee shop, a meeting room, or out in the 
middle of the ocean! (Just keep it below decks.) An Apple MacBook offers 
the same processing power, holds the same RAM, and has the same hard 
drive capacity as one of Apple’s desktop iMac systems. A MacBook hums 
contentedly as you run Apple’s latest operating system, Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard. Heck, you can even connect the same external devices and access 
the same networks as a desktop!
So now, the mantra has changed irrevocably from the old days: The 
important thing is to compute (and if you’re in range of a wireless network, 
to communicate) wherever you want to work today! In fact, I’ve written a 
good chunk of this book from my backyard, using my MacBook Pro . . . while 
flinging bread crumbs at our resident cardinals.
The book that you hold in your hands uses the classic For Dummies design; 
it provides you with the step-by-step instruction (plenty of which my 
editors grudgingly agree is somewhat humorous) on every major feature of 
both your MacBook and Mac OS X Snow Leopard. It also goes a step further 
from time to time, delving into why something works the way that it does 
or what’s going on behind the scenes. You can chalk that up to my sincere 
admiration for everyone in Cupertino and what they’ve perfected.
What you won’t find in this All-in-One is wasted space. Your MacBook is 
covered from front to back, including the latest hardware that Apple has 
added to the MacBook line. Snow Leopard’s new features are here too, 
including improvements to Apple Mail, Safari, the latest versions of all 
the “iApps ’09” (including iWeb), and the new incarnation of iWork ’09. 
Everything’s explained from the ground up, just in case you’ve never touched 
a MacBook before. By the time you reach the final pages, you’ll have covered 
advanced topics, such as networking, AppleScript, Internet security . . . and 
yes, even an introduction to the powerful world of UNIX that exists underneath.

What’s Really Required
I sincerely hope that you enjoy this book and that it will act as your guide 
while you discover all the wonderful features of the MacBook and Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard that I use every day. Remember, if a Windows-enslaved 
acquaintance still titters about your Mac laptop, I’ll understand if you’re 
tempted to drop this weighty tome on his foot. (Of course, because you’re 
using an Intel-based MacBook, you can also boot into Windows and watch 
him turn purple.)
 
The official name of the latest version of your operating system is (portentous 
pause here, please) Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard. But who wants to 
spit out that mouthful every time? Throughout this book, I refer to the 
operating system as Mac OS X, and when I discuss something that’s 
particular to the latest version, I call it Snow Leopard.
What’s Really Required
If you have a MacBook that’s either running Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow 
Leopard) or is ready to be upgraded to it, you’re set to go. Despite what you 
might have heard, you won’t require any of the following:
 
✦ A degree in computer science: Apple designed the MacBook for regular 
people, and I designed this book for people of every experience level. 
Even if you’ve never used a Mac before, you’ll find no hostile waters 
here.
 
✦ A fortune in software: I do describe additional software that you can 
buy to expand the functionality of your MacBook; however, that section 
is only a few pages long. Everything else covered in this book is included 
with Mac OS X Snow Leopard — and by the size of this volume, you get a 
rough idea of just how complete Mac OS X is! Heck, many folks buy Macs 
just because of the free software you get, such as iMovie and iPhoto. 
(Tough cookies to the vast Unwashed Windows Horde.)
 
✦ An Internet connection: Granted, you’re not going to do much with 
Apple Mail without an Internet connection, but computers did exist 
before the Internet (and not every spot on Earth has wireless network 
access yet). You can still be productive with your MacBook and Mac OS X 
without the Internet.
Oh, you will need a Mac OS X version 10.6 installation disc, unless Snow 
Leopard came pre-installed on your MacBook. Go figure.

Conventions Used in This Book
About This Book
Although this book is an All-in-One, you can also read it in a linear fashion 
(straight through) — probably not in one session, mind you. (Then again, 
Diet Coke is cheap, so it is possible.) The material is divided into nine 
minibooks, each of which covers an entire area of MacBook or Mac OS X 
knowledge. For example, you’ll find minibooks on upgrading your hardware, 
networking, the Apple Digital Hub suite of applications known as iLife, 
Apple’s iWork office productivity suite, customizing your Desktop, and 
Internet-related applications.
Each self-contained chapter discusses a specific feature, application, 
connection, or cool thing about either your MacBook or Mac OS X. Feel free 
to begin reading anywhere or skip chapters at will. For example, if you’re 
already using an Internet connection, you won’t need the chapter on adding 
an Internet connection. However, I recommend that you read this book from 
the front to the back, as you do any good mystery novel. (Spoiler alert: For 
those who want to know right now, Bill Gates did it.)
Conventions Used in This Book
Even For Dummies books have to get technical from time to time, usually 
involving commands that you have to type and menu items that you have 
to click. If you’ve read any of my other For Dummies books, you know that a 
helpful set of conventions is used to indicate what needs to be done or what 
you see on-screen.
Stuff you type
When I ask you to type a command or enter something in a text field (such 
as your name or phone number), the text appears like this: Type me.
Press the Return key to process the command or enter the text.
Menu commands
When I give you a specific set of menu commands to use, they appear in the 
following format: Edit➪Copy.
In this example, you should click the Edit menu and then choose the Copy 
menu item.

How This Book Is Organized
Book III: MacBook Customizing and Sharing
Who wants to stick with the defaults? The material in this minibook leads 
you through the steps that you need to customize both your MacBook and 
Snow Leopard to your specific needs and desires . . . everything from a 
tweak to your background or screen saver to a description of how to set 
up and administer multiple accounts on a single MacBook. You also find 
comprehensive coverage of the different settings you can change in System 
Preferences, which is an important place in Mac OS X — including the 
MacBook-specific settings that only laptop owners can use. Finally, I discuss 
tips and important rules you should follow to help keep your MacBook and 
your private information safe online.
Book IV: Going Mobile with iLife
Sweet! This minibook jumps right in among the crown jewels of the Digital 
Hub: iTunes, iPhoto, iDVD, iMovie, iWeb, GarageBand, QuickTime Player, 
and the DVD Player. Taken as a suite, those first six applications make up 
iLife ’09, and they allow you to plug in and use all sorts of electronic gadgets 
while you’re on the road, including digital cameras, digital video (DV) 
camcorders, and MP3 players. Plus, you can edit or create your own DVDs, 
audio CDs, and movies — from the comfort of your favorite coffee shop!
Book V: iWork for the Road Warrior
iWork ’09 is rapidly becoming the favorite office productivity suite among 
the Apple Faithful, and the suite runs beautifully on a MacBook — I recommend 
a bench at the park! You’ll find a chapter devoted to each application: Pages 
for desktop publishing, Numbers for spreadsheets, and Keynote for presen-
tation projects. Who needs that other productivity suite? (I forget the name.)
Book VI: The Typical Internet Stuff
This minibook contains just what it says. But then again, it’s easy to get 
enthusiastic about Apple Mail, the latest version of Apple’s instant messaging 
application (iChat), and the online storage provided by iDisk. I also cover 
Safari, Apple’s hot-rod Web browser. Finally, you discover more about the 
built-in Internet firewall and how you can use it to safeguard your MacBook 
from Internet undesirables.
Book VII: Networking in Mac OS X
Wired and wireless Ethernet lurk in this minibook. I explain them step by 
step, in language that a normal human being can understand. Find out how 
to use wireless networks such as AirPort Extreme from Apple as well as how 
to share an Internet connection with other computers in a local network.

Icons Used in This Book
Book VIII: Expanding Your System
Time to take things up a notch. In this minibook, I discuss the hardware 
and software that you can add to your MacBook and why you might (or 
might not) need such toys. Memory (RAM), hard drives, printers, USB, and 
FireWire 800 . . . they’re all discussed here in detail. Consider this a banquet 
of expansion information.
Book IX: Advanced Mac OS X
I know that I told you earlier that I was going to avoid techno-talk whenever 
possible, yet I also mentioned the advanced things that you find in this 
minibook, such as using UNIX within Mac OS X and using Automator to 
build your own custom workflow applications that handle repetitive tasks. 
If you don’t mind immersing yourself in all that’s technical, read here for 
the skinny on communicating with Mac OS X by using your voice and your 
handwriting.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are more than just attractive — they’re also important 
visual cues for stuff that you don’t want to miss.
 
Mark’s Maxims represent way-important stuff, so I call your attention to 
these nuggets in bold, like this:
Something Really Important Is Being Said that will likely affect your 
person in the near future. Pay attention, commit those Maxims to memory, 
and you’ll avoid the pitfalls that the rest of us have hit along the way.
 
The Tip icons flag snippets of information that will save you time or trouble 
(and, in some cases, even cash).
 
These icons highlight optional technical information for folks like me. If you 
also used to disassemble alarm clocks for fun when you were six years old, 
you’ll love this stuff.
 
Always read the information next to this icon first! Something looms ahead 
that could put your hardware or software at risk.
 
Look to the Remember icons for those tidbits that you need to file away in 
your mind. Just remember to remember.

Chapter 1: Exploring 
MacBook Basics
In This Chapter
✓ Comparing MacBooks to desktop Macs
✓ Deciding on a laptop
✓ Identifying the external parts of your Mac laptop
✓ Understanding the important hidden components
M
ost of my readers who pick up this book are already MacBook 
owners, happy with their mobile Mac and yearning to know more 
about how it works and how to use it. Folks, I salute you, but I’ll be honest: 
You don’t really need to read the first part of this chapter! You’ve already 
made your decision betwixt laptop and desktop.
It’s true, however, that not every computer owner needs a laptop. (I’m no 
heretic — just pointing out that mobility isn’t of primary importance to 
many people.) Because laptops are generally more expensive than desktop 
systems of similar power and capabilities, you should consider a laptop 
only if you really need the unique features it offers.
If you haven’t yet made up your mind about whether to replace your 
desktop computer with a laptop — or whether you need to add a MacBook 
to your present collection of desktop computers — then this chapter is 
especially for you. I compare laptop and desktop configurations, and ask 
you the three important questions you should consider before making the 
decision to buy a MacBook. Next, I give you a quick tour of the basics of a 
MacBook.
“One Uses a Battery!”
That’s a quote from one of my family members — I won’t say who — 
concerning the main difference between my MacBook laptop and my iMac 
desktop. And you know, many Mac owners would probably agree with my 
youngest daughter on that point. (Whoops, what a giveaway!)
However, there’s a surprising number of pros and cons to owning a laptop 
compared to a stationary Mac desktop computer. In this section, I cover 
those pros and cons — just so that you’ll have the whole picture.

10
“One Uses a Battery!”
The “absolute” need for mobility
Many Mac owners just plain need the portability of a MacBook — either they 
need to run their applications on-site, or they’re constantly traveling as part 
of their career or lifestyle. If you fit into this group, you really have no choice 
other than to have a laptop. Students, business travelers, and those who 
need their applications wherever they are, look no further than a MacBook.
But what about those folks who travel only occasionally, or people who like 
a change of scenery from time to time (such as downstairs, the backyard, or 
the library)? Or folks who simply want a computer they can put away easily 
when it’s not in use? Although a MacBook is less of a “sure thing” purchase 
for those who aren’t born nomads, that versatility can still be very tempting! 
Oh, and don’t forget that you also carry all your data and those all-important 
applications with you whenever you lug your MacBook from one spot to 
another.
Therefore, if you feel that you’d prefer to work away from your home (or 
office or dorm) at least once or twice a week, you should also consider the 
MacBook alternative.
Space saving is a good thing
Do you operate in a minimum of space? The MacBook is a good choice for 
those looking to achieve the smallest footprint possible (that’s a term that 
technowizards use to describe the amount of space a computer takes up on 
your desk). The other obvious choices are the iMac and the Mac mini, which 
are both desktops.
The Mac mini is a computer that takes up very little desktop space — in 
fact, the mini is about the size of a ham sandwich (with two slices of cheese 
and a tomato or two). However, it doesn’t include a monitor, keyboard, or 
mouse, so you have to add those things (with the space they demand), so 
the footprint you’re left with is really not much better than a typical PC in a 
“pizza box” case.
The iMac includes an internal monitor, but it’s a minimum of 20 inches, 
which increases the footprint of the entire computer. As with the Mac mini, 
you have to add a keyboard and mouse.
So we’re left with the MacBook, which takes up about 13 x 9 inches of desk 
space with its built-in display panel, keyboard, and trackpad. It’s no accident 
that many corporations now supply laptops to employees as standard 
equipment — even to those office-bound workers who don’t take business 
trips. Laptops offer the full computing experience, no matter how small your 
cubicle!

“One Uses a Battery!”
Enclosed and constrained
Sometimes it’s easy for many Mac owners to forget that MacBooks aren’t 
as expandable as a Mac Pro desktop. (In fact, this limitation also applies to 
the Apple iMac and the Mac mini, which are — same as a MacBook — highly 
integrated, with no room for hardware expansion.)
Although you can hang plenty of peripherals off a modern MacBook (using 
USB and FireWire ports), full-size desktops are just plain easier to expand 
and upgrade with internal hardware. The prime examples of this are the 
internal graphics, sound, and wireless networking cards on a full-size Mac 
Pro, which on a MacBook are impossible to upgrade.
Adding a second or even a third hard drive to a Mac Pro is a fairly simple 
operation: The case has plenty of room, and the Mac Pro already sports 
the internal connectors and power cabling for all those new drives. With 
a MacBook, however, you can upgrade the internal hard drive only with 
another high-capacity drive, and the procedure is best performed by an 
Apple technician. Adding a second drive to a MacBook can be done only 
with an external USB or FireWire drive (which adds more stuff to carry 
with you . . . which cuts down on that mobility you prize so highly as a 
laptop user).
In a nutshell, those Mac power users who will want to upgrade their 
computers with the latest technologies in the future (such as hard-core 
gamers) should consider a Mac Pro desktop system first.
Paying the laptop price
Dear readers, I cannot lie: You pay dearly for the portability of a MacBook. 
As an example, compare an iMac desktop computer and a MacBook Pro 
laptop computer with these (roughly) similar components:
 
✦ Processor: The iMac sports a 2.66GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 
whereas the MacBook Pro has a slightly faster 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo CPU.
 
✦ RAM: Both computers have 4GB of RAM installed.
 
✦ Hard drive capacity: The MacBook Pro sports a 500GB hard drive, 
whereas the iMac offers a larger 640GB hard drive.
 
✦ Screen size: Our MacBook Pro has a 17-inch widescreen display, and the 
iMac has a 20-inch widescreen monitor.
Now for the tale of the register tape: At the time of this writing, the iMac 
will set you back $1,374, whereas the MacBook Pro runs a hefty $2,499! 
Portability comes at a premium for road warriors.

12
So, Are You Ready for a MacBook?
Repairs may cause dizziness
There’s another high-dollar headache for all laptop owners (both Mac and 
PC). Compared to a desktop computer, repairs on your laptop are harder to 
perform, the components cost more, and the repairs are almost certain to 
take longer. Also, depending on use, a MacBook’s battery is almost certain to 
require replacement in four to five years.
Consider this typical scenario: If the graphics card fails in your Mac Pro 
desktop, you can easily replace it yourself with a new (and likely even more 
powerful) graphics adapter card. You simply open the case, unscrew the old 
card, and replace it with a new one.
However, if the sound hardware fails in your MacBook (or iMac, or Mac 
mini), it’s time to pull out your wallet. Why? As I mention earlier, the hardware 
on these three systems is all integrated onto the motherboard, so you can’t 
fix it yourself. Therein lies the rub. The entire motherboard probably needs 
to be replaced, and ordering parts and performing the necessary surgery 
take time.
Here’s an important Mark’s Maxim that I practice myself:
 
If you invest in a MacBook, you should also invest in AppleCare coverage 
for your laptop.
Although AppleCare is pricey ($249 extends your technical support and 
warranty coverage for a full three years), it’s worth every penny if a 
hardware component breaks!
So, Are You Ready for a MacBook?
Now that you’ve absorbed all the pros and cons of a laptop computer, it’s 
time to make the decision on which system you should buy. If you answer 
“yes” to each of these three questions, a MacBook should be in your future!
 
✦ Is mobility important? If you need your computing on the go (or you’d 
like the freedom to be able to move from place to place), I recommend 
that you jump to the MacBook side of the fence.
 
✦ Is a laptop in your price range? As I prove earlier, you’ll pay considerably 
more for a MacBook (as well as for repairs later, if you should need 
them). If you can afford the higher price point, you’ve cleared another 
hurdle.
 
✦ Are you comfortable with the upgrade limitations of a laptop? If your 
MacBook will probably run your applications acceptably for at least four 
years (or more), hardware upgrades are likely to be less of a concern 
and you can buy a MacBook with confidence.

Looking Over Your Laptop
After you’ve chosen the Way of the Laptop, you also have to select the 
MacBook model that’s right for you — and it’s no small coincidence that 
Chapter 2 of this minibook is devoted to helping you with that choice if 
you haven’t already. The rest of this chapter, meanwhile, is devoted to 
familiarizing you with the basic parts of the MacBook you have or are 
considering.
Looking Over Your Laptop
Most action films have one scene in common: I call it the “gear up” scene, 
where the good guys strap on their equipment in preparation for battle. (It 
doesn’t matter what era: You see “gear up” scenes in Gladiator, Aliens, and 
virtually every movie Arnold has made.) You’re sure to see lots of clicking 
straps and equipping of offensive weapons (and sometimes even a dash of 
war paint). The process usually takes a minute or so, all told with whiplash 
camera work and stirring martial music in the background.
Well, fellow Macintosh Road Warrior, it takes only two seconds and one move 
for you to gear up: closing the lid! That’s because your MacBook is a self-
contained world, providing virtually everything you’ll find on a desktop iMac 
or Mac Pro. This is indeed the decade of the laptop, meshing nicely with 
your cell phone and that wireless connection at your local coffee shop. You 
have selected the right companion for the open road.
Unlike some of Apple’s other designs, such as the Mac Mini or the iMac, your 
MacBook looks similar to a PC laptop running Windows. (In fact, a MacBook 
can run Windows, if you absolutely must.) But your laptop holds a number 
of pleasant surprises that no PC laptop can offer — and, in the case of the 
MacBook Air, you’ll lose pounds and inches from your chassis! Sure, your 
MacBook Pro might be but an inch thin (and a MacBook Air, which I cover 
in Chapter 2 of this minibook, is even more svelte than that), but a lot of 
superb design lives inside, and you’ll encounter the same parts that you’d 
find in a desktop machine. In this section, I discuss those important parts — 
both the stuff you can see and the stuff that’s shoehorned within. Welcome 
to your Mac laptop, good reader. Gear up!
The parts you probably recognize
All laptops require some of the same gizmos. Figure 1-1 helps you track 
them down. Of course, as you’d expect, a computer has a body of sorts in 
which all the innards and brains are stored. It also sports a display screen, 
a keyboard, a trackpad or other pointing device, and ports for powering and 
exchanging data with outside toys.

Are you using an older iBook or PowerBook? 
It seems that Apple’s product line changes 
every time you tear a page from your 12-month 
calendar, and every new generation of laptops 
includes new whiz-bang features. Sometimes 
you can add those features — such as an 
external iSight camera or an AirPort Extreme 
card — separately to your older machine, but 
you can’t update some things, such as your 
iBook motherboard. Sigh.
Here’s my take on this situation: If your older 
laptop does what you need at a pace you can 
accept, there is no need to upgrade it.
Skeptical? Here’s the proof: Before my recent 
upgrade to a MacBook Pro, yours truly was 
lugging a pristine iBook G3, which booted 
Mac OS X Tiger and did absolutely everything 
that I demanded. (A little more patience was 
required, certainly, but technology authors are 
simply brimming with patience.) The moral: 
Avoid the upgrade fever unless you really need 
a new companion!
If your laptop bears the iBook or PowerBook 
logo, you can still enjoy this book and discover 
new tips and tricks from it! (Remember, however, 
that features that are specific to Snow Leopard 
require an Intel-based MacBook.) Unless 
today’s breed of Intel-based Mac laptops has 
a feature that you absolutely can’t use on your 
iBook (such as booting directly into Windows 
or using Multi-touch trackpad motions), you 
can sail on with your current computer, fiercely 
proud of The Bitten Apple that appears on the 
cover. Although this book was written with the 
MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro 
lines in mind, much of what you read here still 
applies to your older laptop. Unless it’s steam 
driven, of course.
Feeling outdated? Never!

Looking Over Your Laptop
That magnificent screen
What a view you have! Today’s Mac laptops feature a 13", 15", or 17" LCD 
or LED display (depending on the model you choose). Today’s displays are 
available in glossy finish (a good choice for the brightest colors and deepest 
blacks).
 
LCD screens use far less electricity than their antique CRT ancestors do, and 
they emit practically no radiation.
Apple’s laptop screens offer a widescreen aspect ratio (the screen is 
considerably wider than it is tall), which augurs well for those who enjoy 
watching DVD movies. (A favorite editor of mine loves it when I use the 
antique word augur, meaning to predict or foretell.)
 
That reminds me: Throw away your printed dictionary! You won’t need it, 
because Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes the fantastic Dictionary widget, 
which uses the Internet to retrieve definitions from the online Oxford 
American Dictionary site. More on widgets in general in Book III, Chapter 2 . . . 
and yes, the Dictionary widget does contain augur.
The keyboard and trackpad
Hey, here’s something novel for your laptop. Whereas a standard desktop 
computer has external input devices, your Mac has a built-in keyboard and 
trackpad (which does the job of a mouse). The keyboard is a particular 
favorite of mine for a few reasons:
 
✦ You can either control the sound volume or mute all that noise 
completely.
 
✦ You can use illuminated keyboards (at least on high-end Mac laptops), 
which are perfect for darkened dorm rooms and airplane flights.
 
✦ A handy-dandy Media Eject key lets you eject a CD or DVD.
The disc slot
You’ll notice a long groove at the bottom-right corner of your MacBook or 
MacBook Pro. (No, it’s not for your credit card.) This slot accepts CDs and 
DVDs into your optical drive. If the drive is empty, loading a disc is as simple 
as sliding it in an inch or so; the drive sucks in the disc automatically. (And 
we don’t need a stinkin’ floppy. Macs haven’t had floppy drives for years 
now, and the PC types are finally following suit.)
 
A MacBook Air doesn’t sport any internal optical drive. You use either the 
CD & DVD Sharing feature in Snow Leopard to read discs remotely (from 
another Mac or PC on your network), or you can pick up an external optical 
drive from Apple for about $100. (Such is the price you pay for super-thin 
and super-light.) I discuss the MacBook Air in detail in Chapter 2 of this very 
minibook.

“Luke, the printed label side of the disc should always be facing you when 
you load a disc. Always.”
Food for your ears
A machine this nice had better have great sound, and the MacBook doesn’t 
disappoint. You have a couple of options for Mac laptop audio:
 
✦ All Mac laptops sport built-in speakers (and a microphone to boot). 
The MacBook Air has a single speaker, and MacBook and MacBook Pro 
models have stereo speakers.
 
✦ The built-in audio Line Out jacks connect your MacBook’s audio to a pair 
of headphones, or a more powerful (and expensive) external speaker 
system, or a home stereo system.
The power cable
Sorry, can’t get a wireless power system . . . yet. (Apple’s working hard on 
that one.) However, the MacBook Pro was the first major release of a laptop 
with a magnetic power connector; the MacBook and MacBook Air followed 
suit soon after. The MagSafe connector reduces the chances of your pride 
and joy being yanked off a desk when someone trips over the power cord, 
because the magnetic closure pops off under significant strain. Now that’s 
sassy.
The power button
Yep, you have one of these, too. It’s on the upper right, next to the keyboard, 
bearing the familiar “circle with a vertical line” logo.
If this isn’t your first Mac laptop, you’re 
probably looking for the Apple Remote amongst 
all the styrofoam. Unfortunately, the latest crop 
of MacBooks doesn’t come with a remote. 
This once-standard device, which looks like 
an iPod Shuffle, allowed you to control your 
laptop wireless from across the room. Think 
DVD viewings, presentations, and lazy iTunes 
listening.
If you’ve picked up a used MacBook or 
MacBook Pro, you might have a remote already. 
Otherwise, you can always buy one directly 
from Apple for about $20. However, you can’t 
use an Apple Remote with the MacBook Air, 
which doesn’t have an IR (infrared) receiver.
Hey, where’s my remote?

The iSight camera
Check out that tiny square lens above your screen. That’s a built-in iSight 
camera, which allows you to chat with others in a videoconferencing 
environment using Snow Leopard’s iChat feature. You can even take photos 
with it, using the Photo Booth software that comes with your laptop, or set 
up a travelin’ Webcam.
The battery compartment
Owners of a MacBook or MacBook Pro can open the cover on the bottom 
of your laptop to switch batteries. Many road warriors who constantly use 
their laptops for extended periods swear by extra batteries, especially if 
they’re on-site in the middle of nowhere and there’s not an AC outlet to be 
found.
Of course, your laptop automatically charges the battery while it’s plugged 
in, so you shouldn’t have to remove the battery unless you’re replacing it or 
switching it with another battery.
If you’re using a MacBook Air, your battery is sealed inside the case and 
can’t be swapped. Only an Apple technician can replace a dead battery in a 
MacBook Air laptop.
The holes called ports
The next stop on your tour of Planet Laptop is Port Central — those rows of 
holes on the sides of your computer. Each port connects a different type of 
cable or device, allowing you to easily add all sorts of functionality to your 
computer.
Each of these stellar holes is identified by an icon to help you identify it. 
Here’s a list of what you’ll find and a quick rundown on what these ports do.
Connections for external devices and networking:
 
✦ FireWire: These ports are the standard in the Apple universe for 
connecting external hard drives and DVD recorders, but they do 
double-duty as the connector of choice for peripherals such as mini-DV 
camcorders. (A peripheral is another silly techno-nerd term that means 
a separate device you connect to your computer.) Depending on the 
model of laptop you chose, you may have one of the older FireWire 
400 ports or you may have a much faster FireWire 800 port. Current 
MacBooks (except the MacBook Air) have at least one FireWire port; the 
MacBook Air, on the other hand, offers only USB. Speaking of which . . .

18
Looking Over Your Laptop
 
✦ USB: Short for Universal Serial Bus, the familiar USB port is the jack-of-
all-trades in today’s world of computer add-ons. Most external devices 
that you want to connect to your laptop (such as portable hard drives, 
scanners, and digital cameras) use a USB port, including the iPod. 
Depending on the model of laptop, you’ll have either two or three USB 
2.0 ports available. USB 2.0 connections are much faster than the old 
USB 1.1 standard, but they still accept USB 1.1 devices running at the 
slower speed.
 
 Get the lowdown on FireWire and USB ports in Book VIII, Chapter 3.
 
✦ Ethernet: Today’s Mac laptops include a standard 10/100/1000 Ethernet 
port, so the laptop is ready to join your existing wired Ethernet network. 
(Alternatively, you can go wireless for your network connection; more 
on that in Book VII.) Because the MacBook Air is designed to be completely 
wireless, it doesn’t have a wired Ethernet port, but if necessary, you can 
add a USB Ethernet adapter to add a wired network port to your Air.
 
✦ ExpressCard/34 or SD memory: When you need the absolute fastest 
performance possible from an external device, you can connect that 
device to your laptop using the ExpressCard slot. These cards are the 
descendants of the popular PCMCIA (or PC Card) cards, which many 
models of older Mac PowerBooks used. Currently, only the 17-inch 
MacBook Pro offers an ExpressCard slot, but the 13- and 15-inch 
MacBook Pro models include a standard SD memory card slot (a treat 
for digital photographers because it allows iPhoto to import photos 
directly from an SD memory card).
Connections for external video and audio are
 
✦ VGA/DVI connector: In case that splendid screen isn’t big enough, you 
can buy an adapter for this port that allows you to send the video signal 
from your laptop to another VGA or DVI monitor, or even S-Video output 
for your TV and VCR.
 
✦ Headphone/Optical Output: You can send the high-quality audio from 
your rectangular beast to a set of standard headphones or an optical 
digital audio device such as a high-end home theater system.
 
✦ Optical Line In: Last (but certainly not least) is the optical audio Line In 
jack, which allows you to pipe the signal from another audio device into 
your laptop. This one comes in particularly handy when you record MP3 
files from your old vinyl albums or when you want to record loops in 
GarageBand. (The MacBook Air doesn’t have a Line In jack.)
Don’t forget the parts you can’t see
When you bought your new digital pride and joy, you probably noticed a 
number of subtle differences between the low-end MacBook and the uber-
expensive, top-end MacBook Pro and MacBook Air models. I call these 

Book I

Basics

Looking Over Your Laptop
differences the Important Hidden Stuff (or IHS, for those of you addicted to 
acronyms), and they’re just as important as the parts and ports that you 
can see.
Internal storage devices:
 
✦ CPU: Today’s Mac laptops feature — gasp! — Intel processors, which 
run faster and cooler than the old Motorola processors that powered 
the iBook and PowerBook models. Of course, the faster the processor, 
the better. (Definitely not rocket science.)
 
✦ Hard drive: MacBook laptops use the current standard in hard drive 
technology: namely, serial ATA hard drives. As you might expect, the 
MacBook Pro laptop line has a larger capacity hard drive as standard 
equipment, but you can special-order a MacBook from Apple with a 
larger hard drive.
 
 The MacBook Pro and MacBook Air have two storage options: You can 
choose serial ATA hard drive or opt for the much more expensive (and 
much more technically impressive) solid-state drive. Hold on to your 
chair — there are no moving parts with a solid-state drive, and it offers 
better performance than a standard hard drive. Think of the solid-state 
drive as an internal USB flash drive, which uses RAM chips instead of 
magnetic platters to hold your data! Pricey, but super-sweet, and Apple 
once again introduces the latest in computer hardware.
 
✦ Optical drive: Okay, I’m cheating a little here. I mention the optical drive 
in an earlier section, but all you can see is the slot, so it qualifies as an 
IHS item. Depending on your MacBook, your computer includes one of 
the following:
 
• No built-in optical drive: The MacBook Air can be equipped with 
an external SuperDrive, or you can use another computer’s drive 
remotely over your wireless network.
 
• A DVD-R/CD-RW SuperDrive: This drive can play and record both CDs 
and DVDs.
Wireless communications devices:
 
✦ Wireless Ethernet: “Look, Ma, no wires!” As I mention earlier, you can 
connect your laptop to an existing wireless Ethernet network. All 
current MacBooks have built-in AirPort Extreme hardware. With 
wireless connectivity, you can share documents with another computer 
in another room, share a single high-speed Internet connection betwixt 
several computers, or enjoy wireless printing. Truly sassy!
 
 Although Apple would want you to build your wireless wonderland with 
an Apple AirPort Extreme Base Station (go figure), you can use your 
MacBook with any standard 802.11 wireless network. And yes, PCs and 
Macs can intermingle on the same wireless network without a hitch. 
(Scandalous, ain’t it?)

20
Looking Over Your Laptop
 
✦ Bluetooth: Let’s get the old “digital pirate” joke out of the way: “Arrgh, 
matey, I needs me a wireless parrot.” (Engineers again . . . sheesh.) 
Although strangely named, Bluetooth is another form of wireless 
connectivity. This time, however, the standard was designed for 
accessories such as your keyboard and mouse, and devices such as a 
personal digital assistant (PDA) and a cell phone.
Video display device:
 
✦ Video card: If your applications rely heavily on high-speed 3-D graphics, 
you’ll be pleased as punch to learn that today’s MacBook Pro line of 
laptops come equipped with muscle-bound GeForce cards from nVIDIA. 
These cards are well suited to 3-D modeling, video editing, and well, 
honestly, blasting the enemy into small smoking pieces with aplomb. As 
of this writing, the MacBook and MacBook Air laptops use an integrated 
video card, so they’re not a good choice for hard-core gaming or 3-D 
design.

✓ Selecting a MacBook Pro
✓ Introducing the MacBook Air
C
hoices, choices! After you’ve made the decision that a laptop is the 
right destination, you still need to choose the model that’s best suited 
for your applications and your computing lifestyle. Apple’s MacBook line 
can fit anyone from a student to a digital media professional, so it’s important 
to select the model that best fits your needs and price range.
In this chapter, I outline the differences between each MacBook model.
Your Entry-Level Mac Laptop
In both price and features, Apple’s MacBook is designed for students and 
Mac users with typical needs, including office applications (such as iWork 
or Microsoft Office), Internet applications, the iLife suite, and the majority 
of games on the market. The default configuration includes 2GB of RAM, but 
the MacBook can accept up to 4GB total.
The MacBook is equipped with a 13.3-inch widescreen LCD screen, and the 
standard hard drive capacity is 160GB. (You can special-order up to 500GB 
for extra elbow room.) MacBooks come standard with a SuperDrive, so they 
can read and write DVDs. Of course, AirPort Extreme 802.11n and Bluetooth 
wireless networking are both built in.
At the time of this writing, the MacBook carries the following ports:
 
✦ Gigabit Ethernet: You can connect your MacBook to a wired Ethernet 
network with ease.
 
✦ Mini-DVI: This port allows you to connect your MacBook to an external 
monitor or flat-panel TV.
 
✦ FireWire 400: This port is a standard one for connecting external 
devices such as hard drives and cameras.

22
The Power User’s Toolbox
 
✦ USB 2.0: These two ports are the most popular ports for connecting 
external devices.
 
✦ Audio In and Out: You can connect an external microphone, a pair of 
headphones, or external speakers to your MacBook using these jacks.
Your MacBook also comes equipped with a built-in iSight video camera (for 
taking both still images and digital video), an on-board microphone, and 
built-in stereo speakers.
At the base price of $999, a MacBook is the perfect ticket for mobile 
computing for the typical Mac user.
The Power User’s Toolbox
You know the old saw about two scoops of ice cream in a cone? Folks used 
to say, “You get everything you get with one scoop, only more.” In effect, 
the MacBook Pro builds on the basic equipment provided with an entry-level 
MacBook, providing serious users with faster performance and storage 
capacity. The MacBook Pro is meant for those using processor-intensive 
behemoths such as Photoshop and Final Cut Pro (think digital media 
professionals), as well as computer users who want to play the latest games 
or run the most demanding applications.
To support the faster processors in the MacBook Pro, Apple also provides 
4GB of RAM as a standard; the laptop can accept a maximum of 8GB, which I 
highly recommend if you’re looking for the best possible performance from 
your MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro also sports a backlit keyboard, which 
glows in a darkened room or airplane to allow you to continue working while 
everyone around you snoozes (lucky you!).
Currently, your MacBook Pro can be ordered with three different LED screen 
sizes: 13.3 inches, 15.4 inches, and the super-glorious 17-inch display (all in 
widescreen format). Storage capacity is 500GB for the traditional magnetic 
Serial ATA hard drive, or you can opt for up to 256GB of solid-state storage. 
(More on solid-state drives later in this chapter.) A SuperDrive, AirPort 
Extreme 802.11n, and Bluetooth wireless networking are all on board. The 
MacBook’s iSight camera, built-in microphone, and stereo speakers are also 
included.
The MacBook Pro naturally offers a wider range of ports and connectors 
than a MacBook. The ports include:
 
✦ Gigabit Ethernet
 
✦ Mini-DVI

Meet the MacBook Air
 
✦ FireWire 800: At double the speed of the older FireWire 400 ports, your 
FireWire 800 port is the fastest connection you can make to external 
devices. (Note, however, that you’ll need an adapter to use an older 
FireWire 400 device with this FireWire 800 port.)
 
✦ USB 2.0: The 17-inch MacBook Pro carries three ports instead of the two 
offered on the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models.
 
✦ SD card slot: The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models have a built-in SD 
memory card slot (a great choice for digital photographers).
 
✦ ExpressCard/34 slot: If you opt for the 17-inch model, this slot allows 
you to add peripheral cards that provide additional functions for your 
MacBook Pro, such as an eSATA connection. (In the Windows world, 
these are called PC cards.)
 
✦ Audio In and Out
The least-expensive MacBook Pro runs $1,199, which is a steal for the 
computing professional who needs a laptop on the road with the same 
processing power as a desktop Mac.
Meet the MacBook Air
Here’s a corker of a conundrum: The MacBook Air is a revolutionary laptop, 
unique for both its size and weight, and yet the Air is just like the MacBook 
and the MacBook Pro. Well, mostly.
“Hold on, Mark. How can it be so singular and yet share so much with its road-
warrior siblings?” That’s what I show you in this section, which discusses 
both the many similarities and the handful of very striking differences among 
the three laptops in the MacBook line. If you’re considering buying an Air, this 
section can help you decide whether you’d like to go ultra-thin or stick with 
the conventional laptop crowd.
One thing’s for sure — Apple never does things in a mundane manner!
Comparing MacBooks
Do you remember when Apple introduced those first iMacs? Although they 
shared the same basic components as any computer — a monitor, keyboard, 
ports, speakers, and cables — the iMac was revolutionary because it was 
completely self-contained. And it came in colors. And it didn’t have a floppy 
drive. In fact, Apple had redesigned the common computer with the focus on 
style and ease of use, and had scrapped the floppy (and rightly so, seeing as 
how floppies had become practically useless and were unreliable, to boot).

24
Meet the MacBook Air
I consider the MacBook Air to be an extension of the iMac revolution. With 
this new design, Apple has focused this time on physical dimensions and 
weight, and has tossed anything that isn’t absolutely necessary for the 
lecture hall, board room, or city park. However, I’m happy to note that the 
Air is no toy, nor is it a bare-bones subnotebook. You’ll find the Air as 
powerful as the MacBook, and the Air even shares some of the features of 
the MacBook Pro.
What are the MacBook similarities?
Consider the similarities between the Air and the other MacBooks:
 
✦ Widescreen display: The Air has the same size display as the other 
MacBook models. Same display resolution, same gorgeous graphics.
 
✦ Intel Core 2 Duo processor: The Air is powered by the same type of CPU 
as its siblings.
 
✦ Keyboard and trackpad: The Air has a full-size keyboard, and it’s even 
backlit, just like the MacBook Pro. The Air’s trackpad includes support 
for Multi-Touch control, too.
 
✦ Snow Leopard: The Air runs the latest version of Mac OS X with aplomb.
 
✦ iSight and microphone: Every MacBook Air is video ready, using the 
same iSight camera. You can record audio with the built-in microphone 
as well.
 
✦ Wireless support: As do the other MacBooks, the Air has both built-in 
AirPort Extreme hardware (802.11n) and built-in Bluetooth hardware.
I think most Apple laptop owners would agree that this list covers the major 
features to look for in a MacBook, so we can all agree that the MacBook Air 
is no underpowered pushover.
So what’s so flippin’ radical?
I’m glad you asked! Here’s the checklist of striking differences that set the 
Air apart from the MacBook and MacBook Pro:
 
✦ Physical dimensions: Apple doesn’t call this machine the Air for nothing! 
The current Air laptop measures a mere 0.76" in height (at its tallest 
point) when closed, 12.8" in width, and 8.94" in depth. Oh, and hold on 
to your chair for this one: Our champ weighs in at a lightweight three 
pounds! (That’s a couple of pounds you won’t be carrying around all 
day at that expo. Take it from this traveler: You will feel the refreshing 
difference in just an hour or two.)

Book I
Chapter 2

25
Meet the MacBook Air
 
✦ Cost: At the time of this writing, there are two versions of the Air laptop. 
An entry-level MacBook Air will set you back $1,499, and the top-of-the-
line Air is a very reasonable $1,799. The more expensive Air is equipped 
with a solid-state drive and a faster CPU. (Don’t miss the upcoming 
coverage on why solid-state is worth every penny.)
 
✦ Ports: The Air offers only three ports: a USB 2.0 port, an audio out jack, 
and a Micro-DVI for connecting an external monitor or video device. 
Notice that I don’t mention a FireWire port, which can be a problem for 
Apple old-timers like me. I have a huge collection of FireWire devices. 
The Air also doesn’t have an infrared port, so it’s not compatible with 
the Apple Remote. Rats.
 
✦ Sealed battery: You can’t swap batteries with a MacBook Air because 
the battery is sealed inside the laptop. (Think iPod.)
 
✦ Sealed case: You can’t add or replace RAM modules. However, a 
MacBook Air comes equipped with 2GB of RAM, so you should be good 
to go. Comparatively, the MacBook can hold a maximum of 4GB, and 
MacBook Pro models can be upgraded to 8GB of RAM.
 
✦ Speaker(s): The MacBook Air includes but one speaker.
 
✦ Solid-state drive: Now we’re talkin’, Buck Rogers! I discuss the solid-
state drive option in the next section. The MacBook Pro also offers a 
solid-state drive option.
 
✦ No built-in optical drive: Whoa, Nellie! This is a big one. Apple 
decided that a typical Air owner is likely to use a wireless connection 
for transferring files and media. But what if you have to re-install 
Snow Leopard or new applications? If you need to read or burn discs, 
a separate external USB SuperDrive is available for about $100, or you 
can use the Remote Disc feature and share the drive on another 
computer. (More on Remote Disc later in this section.)
As you can see, these striking differences make the choice between a 
MacBook Air and a MacBook/MacBook Pro very easy indeed. To wit: The Air 
is designed for the traveler who appreciates minimum weight and size but 
doesn’t want to sacrifice the power, full-size screen, and full-size keyboard 
of a typical MacBook. These folks see the MacBook Air as a racecar: nimble, 
with reduced weight and no unnecessary frills. (Think of a typical NASCAR 
entry: Who needs an expensive stereo or air-conditioning?)
If you prefer instead the additional versatility of a MacBook or MacBook Pro — 
including the standard set of ports, the ability to swap batteries, and a 
built-in optical drive — and can live with carrying a few more pounds, I 
highly recommend that you stick with the more conventional MacBook or 
MacBook Pro.

26
Meet the MacBook Air
Look, Ma, no moving parts! 
The magic of solid-state drives
You’re probably familiar with the common species of usbius flashimus — 
more commonly called the USB flash drive. With one of these tiny devices, 
you get the equivalent of a 2–128GB hard drive that plugs into a USB 2.0 port, 
allowing you to pack your data with you as you jet across the continents. 
But have you ever asked yourself, “Self, why don’t they make internal hard 
drives that use this same technology?”
Actually, dear reader, solid-state drives have been around for a number 
of years now (think iPod Shuffle). Unfortunately, however, the solid-state 
memory used in today’s flash drives gets pretty expensive as capacity 
increases. In fact, the cost has been the limiting factor, because a solid-state 
drive offers a number of advantages that really set it apart from a conventional 
magnetic hard drive:
 
✦ No moving parts: Unlike a typical magnetic hard drive, there’s no 
read-write heads, no magnetic platter — just gobs of happy silicon 
memory chips. In effect, a solid-state drive works along the same lines 
as your MacBook’s system RAM. Unlike your Mac’s RAM, though, a 
solid-state drive doesn’t lose the data it stores when you turn off your 
laptop. As you can imagine, no moving parts on a computer in motion is 
superior on two levels:
 
• The solid-state drive never wears out or needs replacing.
 
• If your laptop is accidentally abused (think getting knocked off your 
desk), it’s far less likely that you’ll lose a hard drive’s worth of 
priceless data when it hits the ground.
 
✦ Speed: Oh, my goodness, is this thing fast! Your MacBook will boot/
restart/awake in far less time than computers with magnetic drives can, 
and everything you do on your laptop will benefit from the speed boost. 
A solid-state drive can read data far faster than a conventional magnetic 
hard drive.
 
✦ Power usage: Forget your hard drive spinning up from sleep mode. The 
solid-state drive uses far less power than a conventional hard drive, 
resulting in significantly longer battery life.
 
✦ Blessed silence: The solid-state drive is completely silent. (No more of 
that gargling noise while the disk is accessed. Sweet.)
So do you need the solid-state drive option for your MacBook Air? The 
answer lies in your bank account (as well as your need for elbow room). If 
you can afford the extra expense of the solid-state drive and you can fit all 
your applications and data into 128 or 256GB, I heartily recommend that you 
consider joining Buck Rogers with the storage device of the future.

Meet the MacBook Air
If you’d rather save that coin for something else, or you need a larger 
internal hard drive to hold things like digital video and a massive collection 
of digital images, stick with the tried-and-true magnetic hard drive.
What if I need that pesky optical drive?
Can a laptop survive in the jungle that is Real Life without a DVD drive? The 
terse answer is no. I’ll be honest here: Ripping an audio CD or burning an 
iDVD slideshow disc without an optical drive is impossible. (Rather like a 
cheap tank of gas.) And the wonders of digital media are a big part of the 
iWorld. So what was Apple thinking?
First, a bit of explanation. Today’s DVD drives are thin, but not Air thin. In 
order to create the stunning Air design with truly revolutionary dimensions, 
Apple’s engineers had to leave out the drive. However, if you own a 
MacBook Air, you have two choices when it comes to reading the contents 
of a CD or DVD: Go external, or learn to share.
The external USB route
This is my choice. Personally, I have no problem at all toting around an 
external USB DVD burner with a MacBook Air. Heck, half the time, you’re 
likely to leave it at home because most of us don’t install software every day. 
The folks at Cupertino want you to download your movies from the iTunes 
Store, so if you follow the Apple Path, you still don’t need an optical drive!
A USB SuperDrive from Apple costs a mere $100, and it can read and write 
DVDs as well as the built-in SuperDrive you’ll find in the MacBook and 
MacBook Pro.
You can also use any third-party USB DVD drive that’s compatible with 
Apple’s laptops and Mac OS X Snow Leopard (they’re easy to find on any 
online store that sells Mac external hardware).
Sharing a CD or DVD drive
The other option for installing software or reading a DVD on the MacBook 
Air is Snow Leopard’s built-in CD/DVD Sharing feature. Sharing is an option if 
you have a wired or wireless network with at least one of the following:
 
✦ A Macintosh running Mac OS X Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard
 
✦ A PC running Windows XP or Vista
 
 This requires you to install a Windows application supplied by Apple 
with your MacBook Air.
 
You can only read from a shared optical drive. You can’t write data to the 
remote drive, even if that drive is a DVD recorder.

28
Meet the MacBook Air
To enable sharing, open System Preferences on the Macintosh with the 
optical drive, click the Sharing icon and then select the DVD or CD Sharing 
check box. Note that you can set whether the Mac will request your permission 
when another computer attempts to share the drive.
On a PC, display Control Panel, click the DVD or CD Sharing icon, and then 
select the Enable DVD or CD Sharing check box. Again, you can specify that 
permission is required, in case security is a concern.
After you set up the shared drive, just load the disc and select the Remote 
Disc item in any Finder Sidebar. (Remote Disc appears under the Devices 
heading in the Sidebar.) Now you can access the drive as if it were directly 
connected to your MacBook Air. Ah, technology!

C
onfiguration is not a dirty word. In fact, this chapter contains a set of 
procedures that are a snap to learn: unpacking your new MacBook; 
finding just the right place to park it (when you’re not scampering around 
the world, that is); and connecting sundry cables. Oh, and don’t forget 
starting up your MacBook. I wouldn’t leave out the best part!
Nor would I leave out a really important aspect of owning a MacBook — that 
is, taking care of it. Although laptops are meant for the road, they still need 
regular maintenance (especially the battery, screen, and keyboard).
Location, Location, Location!
If you choose the wrong spot to park your new laptop, I can guarantee that 
you’ll regret it. Some domiciles and office cubicles don’t offer a choice — 
you have one desk at work, for example, and nobody’s going to hand over 
another one — but if you can select a home for your MacBook, consider the 
important placement points in this section:
 
✦ Keep things cool. Your new laptop is silent, but that super fast Intel 
Core 2 Duo processor generates heat. Make sure the location you 
choose is far from heating vents and shielded from direct sunlight. I 
also recommend a laptop cooling pad, which elevates the base of your 
laptop to allow air to circulate underneath.
 
✦ Outlets are key! Your computer needs a minimum of at least one 
nearby outlet, and perhaps as many as three:

30
Unpacking and Connecting Your Laptop
 
• A standard AC outlet: Make sure to use an appropriate current 
adapter if you’re traveling abroad.
 
 You can always add a surge protector (for basic protection against 
lightning). It’s not really necessary to use a Uninterruptible Power 
Supply (or UPS) because your MacBook’s battery will kick in 
automatically in case of a power failure.
 
• A telephone jack: You’ll need this if you have an Apple modem for 
connecting to the Internet or sending and receiving faxes.
 
• A nearby Ethernet jack: This might be needed if you use the MacBook 
or MacBook Pro’s built-in Ethernet port for connecting to a wired 
Ethernet network, or if you buy a USB Ethernet port adapter for your 
MacBook Air.
 
 If you prefer to send your data over the airwaves, consider wireless 
networking for your MacBook.
 
✦ Don’t forget the lighting. Let me act as your mom. (I know that’s a 
stretch, but bear with me.) She’d say, “You can’t possibly expect to 
work without decent lighting! You’ll go blind!” She’s right, you know. 
You need a desk or floor lamp, at a minimum — something to illuminate 
your work. 
 
✦ Plan to expand. If your laptop hangs out on a desk, allow an additional 
foot of space on each side. That way, you have room for external 
peripherals, more powerful speakers, and an external keyboard and 
mouse if you need one.
 
 If you want to keep an external keyboard handy, consider using a laptop 
shelf. These Plexiglas or metal stands elevate your laptop several inches 
above the desk, putting the screen at a better ergonomic position and 
allowing you to park your keyboard and external mouse underneath.
Unpacking and Connecting Your Laptop
You’re going to love this section. It’s short and sweet because the hardware 
configuration of a laptop is a piece of cake. (Sorry about the cliché overload, 
but this really is easy.)
Unpacking for the road warrior
Follow these guidelines when unpacking your system:
 
✦ Check for damage. I’ve never had a box arrive from Apple with shipping 
damage, but I’ve heard horror stories from others (who claim that King 
Kong must have been working for That Shipping Company).
 
 Check all sides of your box before you open it. If you find significant 
damage, take a photograph (just in case).

Book I
Chapter 3
Setting Up and 
Taking Care of Your 
MacBook
31
Unpacking and Connecting Your Laptop
 
✦ Search for all the parts. When you’re removing those chunks o’ foam, 
make certain that you’ve checked all sides of each foam block for parts 
snuggled therein or taped for shipment.
 
✦ Keep all packing materials. Do not head for the trash can with the box 
and packing materials. Keep your box and all packing materials for at 
least a year, until the standard Apple warranty runs out. If you have to 
ship the laptop to an Apple service center, the box and the original 
packing is the only way for your machine to fly.
 
 And now, a dramatic Mark’s Maxim about cardboard containers:
 
 Smart computer owners keep their boxes far longer than a year. If you 
sell your laptop or move across the country, for example, you’ll want 
that box. Trust me on this one.
 
✦ Store the invoice for safekeeping. Your invoice is a valuable piece of 
paper, indeed.
 
 Save your original invoice in a plastic bag, along with your computer’s 
manuals, original software, and other assorted hoo-hah. Keep the bag on 
your shelf or stored safely in your desk, and enjoy a little peace of mind.
 
✦ Read the MacBook’s manual. “Hey, wait a minute, Mark. Why do I have 
to read the manual from Apple along with this tome?” Good question, 
and here’s the answer: The documentation from Apple might contain 
new and updated instructions that override what I tell you here. (For 
example, “Never cut the red wire. Cut the blue wire instead.” Or 
something to that effect.) Besides, Apple manuals are rarely thicker 
than a restaurant menu.
 
 You can always download the latest updated manuals for Apple 
computers in electronic format from Apple’s Web site. (Adobe’s PDF 
format is the standard for reading documents on your computer, and 
Snow Leopard can open and display any PDF document using the 
Preview application or Snow Leopard’s Quick Look feature.) I always 
keep a copy of the PDF manual for my MacBook Pro on my hard drive, 
just in case.
Connecting cables 101
Apple makes all your laptop’s connections simple, but your computer 
depends on you to get the outside wires and thingamabobs where they go.
The absolutely essential connection
After your new MacBook is resting comfortably in its assigned spot (a 
traditional desktop or otherwise), you need to make just one required 
connection: the power cable! Plug the cable into the corresponding socket 
on the Mac first and then plug ’er into that handy AC outlet. (After your 
battery is completely charged, of course, you can go mobile at a moment’s 
notice.)

32
Fire That Puppy Up
Adding the Internet to the mix
If you have Internet access or a local computer network, you need to make at 
least one of the following connections in this section.
If you get on the Internet by dialing a standard phone number and your 
laptop has an external USB modem, just make two more connections:
 
1. Plug one of the telephone cable’s connectors into your external 
modem.
 
2. Plug the other telephone cable connector into your telephone line’s 
wall jack.
After you get your account information from your ISP, check out Book VI, 
Chapter 1 for the details on configuring your modem and Internet settings 
for dial-up access.
If you have high-speed Internet service, or if you’re in an office or school 
with a local computer network, you can probably connect through your 
MacBook or MacBook Pro’s built-in Ethernet port (or an external USB 
Ethernet adapter connected to your MacBook Air). You make two connections:
 
1. Plug one end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port on the 
MacBook.
 
2. Plug the other end of the Ethernet cable into the Ethernet port from 
your network.
 
 Your network port is probably one of the following: an Ethernet wall 
jack, an Ethernet hub or switch, or a cable or DSL Internet router (or 
sharing device).
 
Will you be joining a wireless network? If so, you’ll find the information 
you need on configuring Snow Leopard for wireless networking in Book VII, 
Chapter 3.
Fire That Puppy Up
Your MacBook’s power switch is located on the right side of the keyboard. 
Press it now to turn on your laptop, and you will hear the pleasant startup 
tone that’s been a hallmark of Apple computers for many years. Don’t be 
alarmed if you don’t immediately see anything on-screen; it takes a few 
seconds for the initial Apple logo to appear.

Mark’s Favorite Signs of a Healthy MacBook
 
In my experience, sometimes a quick press of the power button on some 
Mac laptop models just doesn’t do it. Rather, you actually have to hold 
the button down for a count of two or so before the computer turns on. 
However, if your Mac laptop ever locks up (and you can’t quit an application), 
the power button gives you another option: Hold it down for a count of five 
to ten (depending on your counting speed) and your MacBook shuts off — 
even if your laptop is locked up tight.
As the Apple logo appears, you see a twirling, circular, high-tech progress 
indicator that looks like something from a James Bond movie. That’s the 
sign that your MacBook is loading Snow Leopard and checking your internal 
drive for problems. Sometimes the twirling circle can take a bit longer to 
disappear. As long as it’s twirling, though, something good is happening — 
your MacBook is loading some file-sharing, networking, and printing 
components (and such).
At last, your patience of a whole 10 seconds is rewarded, and after a short 
(but neat) video, you see the Snow Leopard Setup Assistant appear. (You 
can find out more about personalizing your MacBook with the Setup 
Assistant in Chapter 1 of Book II.)
Mark’s Favorite Signs of a Healthy MacBook
Before you jump into the fun stuff, don’t forget an important step — a quick 
prelim check of the signs that your new mobile Mac survived shipment 
intact and happy.
If you can answer “yes” to each of these questions, your MacBook likely 
made the trip without serious damage:
 
1. Does the computer’s chassis appear undamaged?
 
 It’s pretty easy to spot damage to your MacBook’s svelte design. Look 
for scratches and puncture damage.
 
2. Does the screen work, and is it undamaged?
 
 Does the cover open smoothly? Are any individual dots (or pixels) on 
your monitor obviously malfunctioning? Bad pixels appear black or in a 
different color from everything surrounding them. (Techs call these 
irritating anarchists dead pixels.) A 13" MacBook screen has literally 
hundreds of thousands of pixels, and unfortunately, some screens 
include one or two dead ones.

34
A Primer in MacBook Handling and Care
 
3. Do the keyboard and trackpad work?
 
 Check your MacBook’s built-in trackpad by moving your finger across its 
surface; the cursor should move on your screen. To check the keyboard, 
press the Caps Lock key on the left and observe whether the Caps Lock 
light turns on and off.
If you do notice a problem with your laptop (and you can use your Safari 
browser and reach the Web), you can make the connection to an Apple 
support technician at www.apple.com. If your MacBook Pro remains dead — 
like an expensive paperweight — and you can’t get to the Internet, you 
can check your phone book for a local Apple service center, or call the 
AppleCare toll-free number at 1-800-275-2273.
A Primer in MacBook Handling and Care
When I first started with computers, a “luggable” computer like my TRS-80 
Model IV was the size of a portable sewing machine or a large manual 
typewriter (yes, I still have it, although I keep it only as a museum piece). 
These behemoths were built like tanks — and they weighed as much, too. 
Portable computers were designed to take considerable punishment, and 
batteries were a dream for the future.
Today’s laptops, however, are a different matter entirely than the luggable 
computers of old: trim, lightweight, and battery-powered, but unfortunately 
much easier to damage while traveling. In this section, I provide you with a 
crash course on proper MacBook handling and battery maintenance.
Great, a lecture about handling my laptop
Proper handling of your MacBook is important, so take a moment to cover 
the Rules of Proper Laptop Deportment. Okay, perhaps I’m lecturing a bit, 
but a little common sense goes a long way when handling any computer 
equipment, and your laptop is no different. (Scolding mode off.)
Keep these rules in mind while opening and carrying your MacBook:
 
✦ The cover is your friend. Open your laptop’s cover slowly, without 
jerking or bending it.
 
✦ Close it before you move it. By closing your laptop, you put your Mac 
OS X operating system into sleep mode. If your MacBook has a typical 
magnetic hard drive with moving parts, the hard drive automatically 
spins down, making it safer to move. (Naturally, if your MacBook uses a 
solid-state drive with no moving parts, this isn’t a concern.) The laptop 
is still on and will spring back to life after you open the cover.

Book I
Chapter 3
Setting Up and 
Taking Care of Your 
MacBook
35
A Primer in MacBook Handling and Care
 
✦ Be nice to your keyboard. Don’t press too hard on those keys! Use 
the same amount of pressure that you use with a desktop computer 
keyboard.
 
✦ Keep food and drinks far away. Care to turn your laptop into a very 
expensive doorstop? Then go ahead and park your soda next to it. (Oh, 
and crumbs are perfect if you’re interested in buying replacement 
keyboards.)
 
✦ Keep your laptop as level as possible. Using your laptop while it’s tilted 
too far in any direction can eventually cause problems with your hard 
drive. I kid you not.
Keeping things clean
Like any desktop computer, your MacBook should receive basic care to 
banish dust and dirt. Although you can’t completely open the case to dust 
(as you can on a Mac Pro), follow these guidelines to keep your MacBook’s 
external surfaces clean:
 
✦ Wipe your laptop’s case every week. I use a soft cloth, but there are 
cleaning wipes specifically made for cleaning computer cases.
 
✦ Consider a laptop sleeve. You can protect your MacBook from dust 
without constantly dragging around a laptop bag or case — invest in a 
cloth or leather sleeve, which simply slides on over the laptop. Easy on, 
easy off!
 
✦ Clean the screen the right way. I always recommend either a 
photographer’s lens cloth or monitor cleaning wipes for use on your 
MacBook’s display panel. (This is not a job for a soft cloth.)
 
✦ Don’t forget the vents. If your MacBook uses a fan or the case sports 
cooling vents, use either compressed air or a computer mini-vacuum to 
clean them every three months or so (or more often if you’re using your 
MacBook in a particularly dusty environment).
 
✦ Your keyboard needs attention, too. In contrast to how you can treat 
a traditional keyboard, it’s never a good idea to turn your Mac laptop 
upside down and shake it! Instead, use the aforementioned computer 
mini-vacuum to clean any crumbs, dust, or other detritus from your 
keyboard.
More about batteries than you 
likely thought possible
Your MacBook’s battery might appear to be maintenance free, but 
unfortunately that’s not the case. Consider these tips as your rules of the 
road for monitoring and charging your battery:

36
A Primer in MacBook Handling and Care
 
✦ Recharge in sleep mode or when powered off. Your battery recharges 
faster when your laptop is off or in sleep mode. (I go into more detail on 
sleep mode in Book II, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Keep your laptop plugged into an AC socket when possible. I take 
every opportunity to top off my laptop’s battery, and so should you.
 
 If you don’t have much time to charge your battery before you’re away 
from an AC socket — say, half an hour — don’t use your MacBook whilst 
it’s plugged in and charging.
 
 Save your juice. For the most juice you can scavenge, here are some 
easy tricks:
 
• Turn off your laptop or leave it in sleep mode.
 
• Turn off unnecessary hardware. To conserve battery power as much 
as possible, disconnect any USB or FireWire devices, and turn off 
your AirPort and Bluetooth wireless hardware if you’re not connected 
to a network. (I cover AirPort wireless networking in Book VII, 
Chapter 3. Bluetooth comes into focus in Book VIII, Chapter 6.)
 
• Reduce the brightness of your display from your laptop’s keyboard, 
using the F1 key.
 
• Remove CDs and DVDs from the optical drive. (MacBook Air owners, 
don’t go hunting for a built-in optical drive, because your laptop doesn’t 
have one.)
 
✦ Monitor your battery level from the Finder menu. I love Snow 
Leopard’s battery-monitoring system! Your laptop’s battery life can be 
displayed in the Finder menu in several different views; my personal 
favorite is as a percentage of power remaining (with a fully charged 
battery registering at 100%). To display the percentage, click the battery 
icon in the Finder menu and choose Show➪Percentage.
 
 Keep in mind that the percentage shown is estimated using your current 
System Preference settings and power usage, so if you change your 
Energy Saver settings or remove a USB device that draws power from 
your laptop, you’ll see that change reflected in the battery meter. 
Figure 3-1 illustrates the battery meter in Percentage view.

✦ Calibrate your battery. You can “train” your battery to provide the 
maximum charge by calibrating it, which Apple recommends doing 
monthly. It’s a snap:
 
a. Charge your battery until the Finder menu battery meter indicates that 
the unit is fully charged at 100%.
 
b. Keep your laptop connected to an AC socket for another two hours to 
ensure a maximum charge.
 
c. Disconnect the power cord and use your laptop on battery power until 
it’s fully discharged and it automatically switches to sleep mode.
 
 Make sure that you close all your applications when you see the low 
battery warning dialog box so that you don’t lose anything.
 
d. Allow your laptop to sleep (or turn it off) for a full five hours.
 
e. Reconnect the AC cord and fully charge your battery.
 
 If your battery is no longer holding a charge — in other words, if you 
fully charge it and unplug the AC adapter, only to discover that 
you have only a few minutes of battery life — it’s time to invest in a 
replacement battery. MacBook and MacBook Pro owners can buy a 
new battery themselves (from Apple or any one of a number of online 
vendors), but owners of MacBook Air laptops must take their computers 
in for servicing. The Air is a sealed unit, and you can’t replace the 
battery yourself.
Laptops generate heat. Today’s super-fast 
multicore processors can work up a head of 
steam — pun intended — while you’re using 
them, and even though most MacBooks have 
a fan, some of that heat is simply radiated from 
the bottom of the computer.
What you might not realize, however, is just 
how much heat your MacBook, MacBook Air, 
or MacBook Pro can produce! No, you won’t 
be scalded if you shift your MacBook from 
a desk to your lap (Apple dislikes lawsuits 
as much as the next company), but if you’ve 
been using that laptop for hours, it will be 
uncomfortably hot!
To avoid that burning sensation, buy a laptop 
stand or cooling pad for your desk. These nifty 
metal or Plexiglas pedestals raise your laptop 
off your desk, allowing air to flow under the 
bottom of the computer for better cooling. 
Also, a laptop stand elevates the screen to a 
more ergonomic position. (The keyboard might 
suddenly be harder to use, naturally, but that’s 
yet another reason that I recommend an external 
keyboard when you’re using your Mac laptop 
at a semipermanent desk location; it saves 
wear and tear on your laptop keyboard, and 
you get a full-size keyboard.)
Hot patootie, is my laptop steam powered?

Book I: Say Hello to Your MacBook

Chapter 4: Extra Stuff 
You’ll Likely Want
In This Chapter
✓ Playing with your bundled software
✓ Buying additional stuff that you might need
O
kay, I know that I’ve been harping on how self-sufficient and all-
inclusive you are as a MacBook road warrior — and believe me, it’s 
true! Everything you need to compute just about anywhere on the planet is 
included when you close your laptop’s cover and go mobile. If you’re in a 
bohemian mood and you want nothing but your MacBook, it’s ready.
But is there other stuff that will make that mobile computing even more 
productive? And convenient? Well, of course — every MacBook power 
owner has extra stuff, and in this chapter I cover the software and hardware 
that most mobile veterans tote along with their laptops.
An Overview of MacBook Software Goodness
This section answers the most common of all novice computer questions: 
“What the heck will I do with this thing?” Here, you find details and exciting 
factoids about the software that you get for free, software you’ll want to 
buy, and stuff you can do on the Internet.
What comes with my laptop?
Currently, Apple laptops ship with the following major software applications 
installed and ready to use:
 
✦ The iLife ’09 suite: You know you want these applications! They turn 
your MacBook into a digital hub for practically every kind of high-tech 
device on the planet, including DV camcorders, digital cameras, 
portable music players, PDAs, and even cell phones.
 
 Book IV focuses on the major applications that make up iLife: iTunes, 
iPhoto, iWeb, iMovie, iDVD, and GarageBand.

40
An Overview of MacBook Software Goodness
 
✦ Photo Booth and Front Row: You can discover more about these 
applications in Book II, Chapter 5. For now, suffice it to say that Photo 
Booth works with your laptop’s iSight camera, and Front Row is the 
remote-control software you’ll use with your Apple Remote (if you 
have one).
 
The installed software on your MacBook might change as new programs 
become available.
Connecting to the Internet from your lap
What is a modern computer without the Internet? Apple gives you 
great tools to take full advantage of every road sign and off-ramp on the 
Information Superhighway right out of the box:
 
✦ Web surfing: I use Snow Leopard’s Apple Safari Web browser every 
single day. It’s faster and better designed than Internet Explorer, with 
unique features such as tabbed browsing and built-in RSS feeds.
 
 If tabbed browsing and RSS feeds sound like ancient Aztec to you, don’t 
worry. Book VI, Chapter 5 is devoted entirely to Safari.
 
✦ Web searches: Dashboard widgets can search the entire Internet for 
stocks, movie listings, airline schedules, dictionaries, and foreign 
language translations. I explain Dashboard in Chapter 2 of Book III.
 
✦ Chat: iChat lets you use your MacBook to chat with others around the 
world for free using the Internet — by keyboard, voice, or full-color 
video. This is awesome stuff straight out of Dick Tracy and Buck Rogers. 
If you’ve never seen a video chat, you’ll be surprised by just how good 
your friends and family look!
 
 Always wear a shirt when videoconferencing.
 
✦ E-mail: Soldier, Apple’s got you covered. The Mail application is a 
full-featured e-mail system, complete with defenses against the torrent 
of junk mail awaiting you. (Imagine a hungry digital saber-toothed tiger 
with an appetite for spam.) Send pictures and attached files to everyone 
on the planet, and look doggone good doing it.
Applications that rock
Dozens of small applications are built into Mac OS X. I mention them in later 
chapters, but here are four good examples to whet your appetite:
 
✦ Safari: Apple’s Web browser of choice — it’s fast, simple, and easily 
customized. See how to navigate the Web in style in Book VI, Chapter 5.

Book I
Chapter 4
Extra Stuff You’ll 
Likely Want
41
An Overview of MacBook Software Goodness
 
✦ DVD Player: Put all that widescreen beauty to work and watch your 
favorite DVD movies with DVD Player! You have all the features of 
today’s most expensive standalone DVD players, too, including a spiffy 
on-screen control that looks like a remote.
 
✦ Address Book: Throw away that well-thumbed collection of fading 
addresses. Use the Snow Leopard Address Book to store, search, and 
recall just about any piece of information on your friends, family, and 
acquaintances.
 
✦ Chess: Ah, but this isn’t the chessboard your Dad used! Play the game of 
kings against a tough (and configurable) opponent — your MacBook — 
on a beautiful 3-D board. Heck, your laptop even narrates the game by 
speaking the moves!
 
You can use the data you store in your Address Book in other Apple 
applications included with Snow Leopard, such as Apple Mail and iChat.
Boot Camp for Dummies
Mac OS X Leopard introduced one particularly exciting feature for Windows 
switchers: You can use the Apple Boot Camp utility and your licensed copy 
of Windows XP to install and boot Windows on your Intel-based Mac laptop! 
Snow Leopard adds Vista support as well as faster operation.
Boot Camp creates a Windows-friendly partition (or section) on your hard 
drive and stores all your Windows files in that partition. Other than the 
slightly strange key assignments you’ll have to remember, early adopters of 
Boot Camp report that it’s surprisingly reliable and easy to use. However, 
I strongly urge that you back up your laptop on a regular basis; inviting 
Windows to your Mac laptop also invites potential viruses and spyware 
as well.
Apple’s Boot Camp Assistant provides step-by-step instructions, making it 
easy to configure your laptop for Windows. To run the Boot Camp Assistant, 
open your Applications folder and double-click the Utilities folder; then 
double-click the Boot Camp Assistant application icon.
Applications you’ll end up getting
Although I cover my favorite must-have applications and utilities in Book 
VIII, Chapter 5, I mention the categories here:
 
✦ A productivity suite: Whether it be Microsoft Office, iWork, or a free 
alternative such as Google’s online applications or OpenOffice.org 3, 
you’ll likely want a quality word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation 
application.

42
Other Stuff That Nearly Everyone Wants
 
✦ Image and video editors: Most MacBook owners need a bit more 
image editing versatility than the basic tools provided by iPhoto and 
Preview — and if iMovie isn’t enough to handle your video-editing 
chores, Apple offers more robust tools.
 
✦ Utilities: Monitor your hard drives and defragment them using tools that 
aren’t included in Snow Leopard’s Disk Utility, such as TechTool Pro 
from Micromat. You can also burn all sorts of data and music discs using 
a third-party application such as Roxio’s Toast Titanium.
 
✦ Games: Your MacBook is powerful enough to run today’s latest games, 
such as Blizzard’s World of Warcraft or Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
Prince from Electronic Arts.
Other Stuff That Nearly Everyone Wants
No man is an island and no computer is, either. I always recommend the same 
set of stuff for new PC and Mac owners. These extras help keep your new 
computer clean and healthy (and some make sure you’re happy as well):
 
✦ Surge suppressor: Even an all-in-one computer like your laptop can fall 
prey to a power surge. I recommend using one of these:
 
• A basic surge suppressor with a fuse can help protect your Mac from 
an overload.
 
• A UPS (uninterruptible power supply) costs a little more, but it does a 
better job of filtering your AC line voltage to prevent brownouts or 
line interference from reaching your computer.
 
 Of course, your laptop’s battery immediately kicks in if you 
experience a blackout, so a UPS is less important for your computer. 
However, any computer tech will tell you that filtered AC current is 
far better for your laptop, and your UPS will also provide power for 
external devices that don’t have a battery.
 
✦ Screen wipes: Invest in a box of premoistened screen wipes to keep your 
screen pristine. Your MacBook’s screen can pick up dirt, fingerprints, and 
other unmentionables faster than you think.
 
 Make sure your wipes are especially meant for LCD or laptop computer 
screens.
 
✦ Blank CDs and DVDs: Depending on the type of optical drive installed 
in your laptop — and the type of media you’re recording, such as 
computer data CDs, DVD movies, or audio CDs — you’ll want blank 
discs for
 
• CD-R (record once)
 
• CD-RW (record multiple times)
 
• DVD-R (record once)

Book I
Chapter 4
Extra Stuff You’ll 
Likely Want
43
Other Stuff That Nearly Everyone Wants
 
✦ Cables: Depending on the external devices and wired network 
connectivity you’ll be using, these are
 
• A standard Ethernet cable (for wired networks or high-speed 
Internet)
 
• FireWire or USB cables for devices you already have
 
✦ A restraining cable: For those who are a little more security-conscious 
or tend to use their laptops in public places, a standard Kensington 
laptop lock slot is provided on the MacBook and MacBook Pro case. 
(Sorry, MacBook Air owners, but your case is too thin to sport a lock 
slot.) The principle is the same as a bicycle cable lock: If your laptop 
is secured by a cable to a sturdy fixture, it’s nearly impossible for it to 
walk off with someone else.
 
✦ A wrist rest: You might have many reasons to buy a new Mac laptop, but 
I know that acquiring a bad case of carpal tunnel syndrome is not one of 
them. Take care of your wrists by carrying a keyboard wrist rest in your 
laptop bag.

t’s human nature to require instant gratification from your software. 
I’ve seen it countless times: Someone runs a program, immediately feels 
comfortable with it, and then spends the rest of his days using that program 
religiously. Or another person plays with the same program for 120 seconds 
and dismisses it as too difficult or too confusing. It’s rather like watching 
a fancy fashion show runway in Rome or Paris: There had better be eye 
appeal pretty quickly or the bucks won’t flow.
Ditto for modern computer operating systems. An operating system is the 
basic software that determines the look and feel of your entire computer 
and usually extends to the programs that you run as well. Microsoft felt the 
pinch of an old-fashioned operating system when Windows 98 and Windows 
Me were starting to appear rather plain looking. Then came Windows XP, 
where menus fade in and out like fireflies on a summer night, little pup-
pies help you find files, and other animation abounds. With Windows Vista, 
Microsoft attempted to match some of the elegance and power of Mac 
OS X in the PC world . . . but to be honest, updating a PC by upgrading to 
Windows Vista is a little like putting on a polyester sports coat over the 
same tired old leisure suit — most of what changes is on the outside. (And 
from what I’ve seen so far, Windows 7 is more of the same.)
Apple doesn’t work that way. Sure, Mac OS X looks doggone good. Forget 
the minimum requirement of shirt and shoes because this operating system 
is wearing an Armani suit. What’s really exciting for Macintosh owners 
around the world, however, is the heart that beats beneath the pretty form. 
At its introduction, Mac OS X was quite literally an operating system revolu-
tion, and it still delivers some of the most advanced features available on

any personal computer in use today while remaining as easy to use as the 
first Macintosh. (And yes, I do own, use, and enjoy both PCs and Macs — 
what’s important to me is which computer does the best job the fastest in 
the easiest manner.)
Now, I’m not going to just haul off and proclaim that Mac OS X can run rings 
around — well . . . you know, the W word — without solid proof. In this chap-
ter, I introduce you to the advantages of using Mac OS X on your laptop and 
why it’s such a step ahead for those running Windows. I also cover the hard-
ware requirements for running Mac OS X version 10.6 (Snow Leopard) as 
well as guidelines on switching from Windows. Finally, I familiarize you with 
the steps that you’ll encounter the first time you fire up the Big X.
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Apple was one of the first to pioneer the graphical approach to computing 
with the appearance of the first Macintosh, so you’d expect Mac OS X to be 
simple to use — and indeed it is. For many folks, that’s Job One. If you’re one 
of those people, you can happily skip this section without need of further 
evidence because Mac OS X is undoubtedly the easiest operating system on 
the planet to use. (And believe me, I’m not knocking simplicity. Computers 
are supposed to be getting easier to use, and techno-nerds like me are sup-
posed to be rendered unnecessary as computers advance.) Here is the 
mantra of the Mac — and the first of Mark’s Maxims for this volume:
 
Make it easy.
Still with me? Need more testimony? Or perhaps you’re just curious about 
the engine under the hood. Then read on — and if you’re a MacBook owner, 
feel free to gloat! (If you’re a PC owner, there’s always eBay.)
Pretty to behold
Let me illustrate with a screenshot or two. Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical 
screen from a day spent in Mac OS v. 9.2, the capable — albeit rather old-
fashioned — version of the Mac OS operating system that shipped in the 
days before Mac OS X.
Compare that screen with a similar screen from the latest version of the 
Big X, as shown in Figure 1-2. As you can see, everything’s streamlined in 
appearance, with maximum efficiency in mind. Tasteful 3-D abounds, from 
the drop-shadowed windows to the liquid-look scroll bars. Icons look like 
miniature works of art. Macintosh owners appreciate outstanding design — 
and can recognize the value of a great computer. After all, many MacBook 
owners are professionals in the graphic arts, and Apple provides the hard-
ware that they need — like the top-of-the-line, light-emitting diode (LED) 
used with the 17-inch MacBook Pro.

Take a look at what’s going on behind the curtain — the Great Oz is actually 
pretty busy back there.
The allure of Aqua
The Apple software developers who introduced us to Mac OS X designed 
this “liquid” look from the ground up. They call it Aqua, and it’s Snow 
Leopard’s standard user interface.
Whoops, I just realized that I slipped a ten-cent example of techno-babble into 
that previous paragraph. Let me explain: A user interface design determines how 
things look throughout both the operating system itself and all applications that 
are written to run under an operating system (OS). This includes the buttons 
that you push, the controls that you click or move, and even the appearance 
of the windows and menus themselves. For example, if you’ve already begun 
to use Mac OS X, you’ve probably stopped right in the middle of a task and 
exclaimed to yourself, “Why, Self, look at that cool 3-D contour effect on that 
menu bar!” That shapely contour is a tiny part of the Aqua user interface design.
Aqua also extends to the placement of controls and how they’re shown to 
you. For example:
 
✦ Mac OS X uses Aqua sheets (which are attached to their parent windows) 
to prompt you for input, such as confirming when you’re about to close 
a document without saving it. In contrast to Windows, multiple programs 
can have multiple sheets open, so you can continue to work in other appli-
cations without being rudely forced to answer the query immediately.
 
✦ Aqua’s file selection controls, such as the one in Figure 1-3, make it 
much easier to navigate quickly to a specific file or folder from within an 
application — as a matter of fact, they look much like Finder windows, 
to keep things consistent and easier to use.

selection 
dialog (done 
right in 
Aqua).

✦ The Dock is another Aqua favorite. The Dock launches your favorite 
applications, indicates what’s running on your MacBook, and allows you 
to switch between those programs — and all in a strip that you can relo-
cate and customize at will. I talk about the Dock in greater detail in Book 
III, Chapter 2.
 
Consider Aqua as the look-and-feel of Mac OS X and virtually all applications 
that it runs; you can discover how to use these Aqua controls in the pages 
to come. Of course, MacBook owners really don’t have to worry about Aqua 
itself; the Aqua guidelines are a roadmap for those writing applications for 
Mac OS X. Programs written to the common Aqua interface standard will be 
easier for you to use, and you’ll become a proficient power user of that pro-
gram much faster.
The quality of Quartz
The second ingredient in the visual feast that is Mac OS X is Quartz Extreme — 
and I must ask your forgiveness, good reader, because I have to get a tad 
technical again. Quartz Extreme is a graphics engine: It’s the portion of Mac 
OS X that draws what you see on the screen (in the Aqua interface, natch). 
Think of the engine in your car, which is responsible for making your car 
move. Whether your MacBook is running Microsoft Word or simply idling 
at the Desktop waiting for you to finish your soda, Quartz Extreme is at 
work displaying icons, drawing shapes, exhibiting the Finder, and animating 
things in the Dock.
What sets Quartz Extreme apart from the ho-hum graphics engine that 
Windows uses? It’s all about international programming standards . . . you 
know, those things that Microsoft would much rather you forget. To wit:
 
✦ PDF: The Quartz Extreme engine is built around the Acrobat Portable 
Document Format (PDF for short) developed by Adobe. If you’ve been 
spending any time at all on the Internet in the last ten or so years, you 
know that PDF files have emerged as the standard for displaying and print-
ing the highest-quality electronic documents. Plus, Adobe has released 
a version of the free Acrobat Reader (www.adobe.com) for just about 
every computer on this green Earth. This means that text and graphics 
displayed in Quartz Extreme are razor sharp, resizable, and easily por-
table from one computer to another. In fact, Mac OS X displays PDF files 
without even requiring Acrobat, using the built-in Preview application. 
Figure 1-4 shows a complex PDF document that I opened in Mac OS X.
 
✦ OpenGL: Gamers will get really excited about this one: Quartz Extreme 
also uses the OpenGL graphics acceleration standard, which delivers 
the fastest 3-D graphics on the planet. (Think photo-realistic, high-
resolution graphics drawn in the blink of an eye.) In fact — and this is a 
really cool trick — OpenGL is even used to produce the Desktop in Mac 
OS X Snow Leopard.

52
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
 
Figure 1-4: 
Yep, that’s 
a PDF 
document, 
not a 
scanned 
image!
 
 
 In English, that means that today’s top-of-the-line, 3-D gaming and 3-D 
graphics acceleration can take care of drawing everything; forget about 
waiting for windows to close or menus to appear, even when you’re cre-
ating the world’s biggest honking spreadsheet or building a presentation 
the size of Baltimore. As the Chairman of the Board would say, “We’re 
talkin’ fast, baby, like a rocket ship to the moon!”
 
✦ Core Animation: Snow Leopard includes functionality that Apple calls 
Core Animation, which makes it much easier for programmers to ani-
mate backgrounds and objects within their programs. Text, 3-D anima-
tion, and video now work seamlessly side-by-side, and eye-catching 
animations within applications, such as Time Machine, are the norm for 
MacBook owners.
Stable, stable, stable
“So it’s elegant in design. That’s great, Mark, but what if Mac OS X crashes? 
Aqua and Quartz Extreme aren’t worth a plug nickel if my cursor doesn’t 
move and I lose my document!” Believe me, I couldn’t agree more; I make my 
living from computers, and every time that a misbehaving program locks up 
one of my machines, I throw a tantrum that would make Godzilla back off. 
Lockups shouldn’t be tolerated in this day and age.

Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
Luckily, the folks who designed Mac OS X were just as interested in produc-
ing a rock-solid operating system as they were in designing an attractive 
look. (Think of Tom Cruise’s face on The Rock’s body.)
Mac OS X is as hard to crash as the legendary UNIX operating system — 
that’s right, the same reliable workhorse that techno-wizards around the 
world use to power the Internet, where stability is all-important. In fact, Mac 
OS X is actually built on top of a UNIX base. It’s just well hidden underneath, 
allowing you and me to focus on our programs and zip around with our 
trackpads without knowing any of those obscure, arcane keyboard com-
mands. You get the benefits of UNIX without a pair of suspenders, a pocket 
protector, or the hassle of growing a beard. (Not to mention years of com-
puter programming experience.)
Apple calls this UNIX foundation at the heart of Mac OS X by another 
nifty title: Darwin. I could tell you that Darwin provides the latest in 64-bit 
memory support and CPU management, but if you’re a normal human being, 
your eyes will glaze over. Suffice it to say that Darwin makes the best use 
of your laptop’s memory (RAM) and your computer’s brain (CPU) — Snow 
Leopard has been fine-tuned for processors with multiple cores, such as the 
Core 2 Duo CPU from Intel. Rest assured that your Web server will stay up 
even if your misbehaving Virtual Birdcalling simulation decides to run amok. 
(Emus running amok . . . how dreadful.)
If you’ve recorded or edited digital video (DV), 
you’re probably already familiar with Apple’s 
QuickTime MOV format. QuickTime movies are 
typically high resolution, relatively small in size, 
and easily created with iMovie, which I discuss 
in Book IV, Chapter 4. Although QuickTime X 
isn’t “on stage” all the time as is Aqua or Quartz 
Extreme, it’s still an important part of Mac OS X: 
Every time you display a video clip that you’ve 
recorded or watch a streaming TV broadcast 
from a Web site, you use QuickTime X. (Note, 
however, that you don’t use QuickTime X to 
watch DVD movies — that job is reserved for 
the Apple DVD Player.) QuickTime X includes 
support for AVC (Advanced Video Codec) for 
the best possible display of the latest HD (High 
Definition) video signals from the expensive 
hardware that’s now appearing at your local 
electronics Maze o’ Wires chain store.
QuickTime is actually not a new Mac OS X 
feature — it’s been around since the early 
1990s — but the latest versions of Mac OS X 
include the free QuickTime Player, which pro-
vides support for the latest broadcast and Web 
video. In fact, you can set up your own TV sta-
tion on the Web with the tools included in the 
Professional QuickTime package.
Don’t forget QuickTime X!

54
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
 
Yes, yet another standard is at work here — uh-oh, Overlord Gates is truly 
angry now! For those who do have a beard and are curious about such 
things, Darwin uses a FreeBSD kernel, so it also inherits all the protocol stan-
dards that have made UNIX the foundation of today’s Internet. You can find 
more about FreeBSD at www.freebsd.org. Because Mac OS X is developed 
as an open source project, software engineers outside Apple can actually 
contribute ideas and code, just as UNIX continues to evolve over time. (And 
yes, you’ll even discover how to access the powerful UNIX command prompt 
from Mac OS X in Book IX, Chapter 1!)
To get an idea of just how well armored Mac OS X is, consider Figure 1-5. See 
how one program, which I call Titanic 1.0, has locked up like San Quentin. 
Under Mac OS 9 and older versions of Windows, your only chance at recov-
ering anything would involve divine intervention. However, in Mac OS X, my 
Pages application is unaffected because it has a completely protected area 
of system memory to play in. (I show you how to force a misbehaving appli-
cation to go away in Book II, Chapter 3.)

X keeps

a reason.

By the way, Darwin makes it easy for UNIX software developers to quickly and 
easily port (or modify) all sorts of UNIX applications to work under Mac OS X. I 
think you’ll agree that a wider selection of applications is a good thing.
Multitasking and multithreading 
for normal human beings
And now, for your entertainment, a short one-act play. (Yes, really.)
A Shakespearean Moment of Multitasking and Multithreading
Our play opens with Julius Caesar shaking his head in disgust at his Mac OS 9 
Desktop.
Caesar: Anon, I am only one mortal, yet my Desktop doth abound with 
portals to applications of all different mien. Tell me, foul beast, why thy

spirit seems slow and sluggish, and my Excel spreadsheet doth crawl on 
its belly!
[Enter Romeo, a cocky and rather brash young Apple software developer.]
Romeo: Dude, the problem is, like, your operating system. Y’see, older 
versions of both Mac OS and Windows ended up constantly, like, shift-
ing your computer’s attention from one app to another — Excel has to 
cooperate with everything else that’s running in the background, like a 
good little corporate boy. It’s less efficient and very, very ’90s. Upgrade 
to Mac OS X, and you get pre-emptive multitasking — the app you’re actu-
ally using, like, gets the lion’s share of the processing time, and every-
thing runs smoother when you need it. That’s the way UNIX works.
Caesar: Verily, your strange tongue doth annoy me. Guards, behead 
him — then obtain for me this Mac OS X.
Romeo: I’m outta here — I’ve got a hot date — but don’t forget, like, Mac 
OS X also uses multithreaded processing, so your MacBook can handle 
different operating system tasks at the same time. It’s kind of like your 
computer can both walk and chew gum at the same time: fast, fast, fast!
[Exit Romeo — rather swiftly — stage right.]
Fin
When the play closes, we can only hope that Romeo is fast as well. (I told 
you it was a short play.)
The definition of Internet savvy
Remember the classic iMac advertisements that touted the one-plug 
approach to the Internet? That entire campaign was centered on one idea: 
that the Internet was supposed to be easy to use. The folks at Microsoft sat 
up and took notice when the iMac proved so incredibly successful, and 
Windows Vista actually reduced some of the overwhelming folderol that you 
had to encounter just to connect to the Internet — but Mac OS X still wipes 
the floor with Vista when it comes to easy and complete Internet connectiv-
ity. For example:
 
✦ Easy configuration: Mac OS X sets up your entire Internet connection 
with a simple assistant (Windows users, think “wizard”) of four screens. 
As long as you’ve got the right information handy (which your Internet 
service provider [ISP] should supply), it’s a snap to set up.
 
✦ iDisk: What if I told you that for a reasonable yearly subscription fee, 
Apple can provide you with a chunk of Internet-accessible, private hard 
drive space — and that you can access this hard drive space from any-
where on Earth with an Internet connection? Absolutely, unbelievably, 

56
Convince Me: Why Mac OS X?
massively cool. This neat trick is called iDisk, and I cover it in detail in 
Book VI, Chapter 4.
 
✦ All the Internet behind-the-scenes stuff: The Internet is basically built 
on a number of protocols (read that as rules for exchanging all sorts of 
data) — and, as I mention earlier, UNIX machines dominate the Internet. 
Ergo, Mac OS X on your MacBook also provides you with support for 
just about every Internet protocol on the planet. Even if you don’t know 
them by name or write your own software, the applications that you buy 
can use them.
 
✦ A gaggle of great Internet applications: Mac OS X ships with all sorts 
of Internet magic built in. For example, you’ll get instant Internet and 
local network communication with iChat (which I cover in Book VI, 
Chapter 3), Safari (covered in Book VI, Chapter 5), and Apple Mail, a 
standard-issue, battle-ready e-mail program (which I discuss in Book VI, 
Chapter 2). Yup, it’s all free.
Lots of free goodies
You don’t just get Internet applications when you latch your fingers onto a 
box o’ Mac OS X — you can start doing all sorts of neat stuff without invest-
ing one extra dollar in more software!
Remember, what you receive along with Mac OS X depends on whether 
you’re buying a boxed copy, upgrading from an older version of Mac OS, or 
receiving the Big X already installed on a new MacBook. With that in mind, 
check out the possibilities.
 
✦ This is the iLife: This suite of easy-to-use integrated programs is 
included with a new MacBook, and it’s practically as well known as 
the computer itself these days: iDVD, iPhoto, iTunes, GarageBand, 
iMovie, and iWeb. Each of these stellar programs is covered in full 
in Book IV. If you’ve got a digital camera, an MP3 player, a USB musical 
keyboard, or a DV camcorder, you’ll be a very happy individual. I 
promise.
 
✦ iWork to the rescue: If you’ve bought a new MacBook with Mac OS X 
pre-installed, you probably also received a test drive version of iWork 
(Apple’s answer to Microsoft Office). Good stuff, indeed. If you don’t 
want to spend the bucks on Office 2008 and you don’t need the complex 
gewgaws and baroque architecture of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, 
I can guarantee you that Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are powerful 
enough to satisfy your office document and presentation yearnings. I 
discuss iWork ’09 in Book V.
 
✦ The obligatory games: Apple typically chooses new games to bundle with 
MacBooks every three or four months — typically, games are selected 
that show off your laptop’s 3-D power, as well as finger-exercising arcade 
challenges. Because this book isn’t a game guide, I leave you to explore 
these games at your leisure.

What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
What Do I Really Need to Run the Big X?
I’ve written ten other For Dummies books — I know, it’s getting to be a habit 
(and a career) — and I always find the “Hardware Requirements” section 
a hard one to write. Why? Well, I know what Apple claims as the minimum 
hardware requirements necessary to run Mac OS X. But, on the other hand, 
I know what I would consider the minimum hardware requirements, and 
they’re substantially different. Oh, well, let me list the bare bones and then 
I’ll give you my take on what you really need. (Naturally, if Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard is pre-installed on your MacBook, feel free to tear out this page and 
create a handful of celebratory confetti.)
From The World According to Jobs, the minimum requirements are as follows:
 
✦ Hardware: You’ll need any MacBook with an Intel processor. This 
means that just about any recent laptop Mac is technically eligible to 
play (although you might find the performance of a first-generation 
single-core MacBook running Snow Leopard to be unacceptable). Again, 
note that you’ll need a DVD drive to install Snow Leopard (although it 
can be installed on the MacBook Air using the remote DVD feature).
 
✦ RAM: You’ll need at least 1GB of memory (RAM). At today’s low prices, 
that’s like buying a pizza.
 
✦ Hard drive territory: Although svelte by Windows standards, Mac OS X 
still needs about 8GB of free space on your hard drive.
From The World According to Chambers, the minimum requirements are
 
✦ Hardware: I recommend a MacBook with at least an Intel Core 2 Duo 
processor. Remember, this is my take on what you’ll need to really take 
advantage of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, and again, I have to say that I 
don’t think it performs well enough on Intel single-core computers.
 
✦ RAM: Don’t settle for anything less than 2GB. Again, with memory as 
cheap as it is these days, this is like adding extra cheese to that pizza.
 
 Time for a Mark’s Maxim:
 
Any techno-nerd worth the title will tell you that the single most impor-
tant key to performance in today’s operating systems is RAM — yep, it’s 
actually more effective than a faster processor!
 
 If you’ve got any extra spending cash in between your sofa cushions, 
spend it on RAM. (Up to an earth-shaking 8GB of RAM on the latest 
MacBook Pro racehorses!)
 
✦ Hard drive territory: I’d recommend having the following:
 
• 10GB free for just the operating system
 
• A minimum of an additional 40 to 60GB for any digital video clips, 
photographs, and songs you’ll be collecting

58
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Upgrading from Earlier Versions of Mac OS
Because the installation of Mac OS is as simple as loading a DVD and double-
clicking an icon, there’s not much to tell. What’s important is the steps that 
you should take care of before you start the installation. I cover those in the 
next section. Pay heed, or pay later. I won’t go into detail about the actual 
installation because there really aren’t any details to speak of — you’ll 
answer a question or two and then hop up to get another cup of coffee or 
another caffeine-laden soda while the installer does the rest. Would anyone 
expect any different from Apple?
Back up — PLEASE back up
I know you’re anxious to join the In crowd, and Apple makes the upgrade 
process as noninvasive and as safe as possible, but SNAFUs such as power 
loss and hard drive failures do happen. With a full backup of your system 
on CD or DVD (or to an external hard drive using Time Machine), you can 
rest assured that you’ll get your precious files and folders back in pristine 
shape if tragedy strikes. To be honest, you need to back up your system on 
a regular basis anyway. Promise me now that you’ll back up your system, 
won’t you?
Snuff out disk errors
Before you upgrade, I recommend that you check that hard drive for errors 
one last time — upgrading a disk with directory errors takes longer. If you’re 
upgrading from an older version of Mac OS X, use Disk Utility, which I cover 
in Book II, Chapter 7. Ain’t technology grand?
Plug it, road warrior
You’re on the road with your MacBook Pro, and you’ve just bought your 
copy of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. You’re thinking of installing your brand-
spanking-new operating system. . . . Stop! NOW.
 
Before you decide to upgrade your laptop, consider what will happen if 
that magical vessel containing all your files should flicker and . . . No, on 
second thought, don’t even visualize it. (Even if the battery is fully charged.) 
If you’re installing a Mac OS X upgrade on a MacBook, MacBook Air, or 
MacBook Pro, make sure that it’s plugged in and receiving its share of good, 
clean AC power from a handy, nearby wall socket. The installation process 
could take an hour, and there’ll be constant hard drive and DVD drive 
activity — think “Attack of the Energy-Draining Installation from Planet 
Lithium.” You don’t want to try this while your MacBook is operating on 
battery power.

Personalizing the Big X
Heck, a techno-purist would probably recommend that you attach your 
MacBook to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for the installation pro-
cess, but I’m not quite that paranoid about power outages.
 
Keep one thing in mind while installing Mac OS X: If you format the destina-
tion drive — the drive where you’ll install Mac OS X — you’ll lose everything 
that it stored. No big surprise there, and the installation program will warn 
you profusely about this beforehand. There’s really no reason to do so 
unless you just crave a clean installation (an installation of a new operat-
ing system on a newly formatted drive, compared with an upgrade of your 
existing Mac OS System files). Oh, and don’t forget to use Mac OS Extended 
(Journaled) format.
Personalizing the Big X
After the installation is complete and you have rebooted the beast, stand 
back and watch those beautiful rounded edges, brushed stainless-steel sur-
faces, and liquid colors appear. But wait — you’re not quite done yet! Mac 
OS X needs to be personalized for you, just like your toothbrush or your 
SUV’s six-way power seat; therefore, use the Setup Assistant that automati-
cally appears the first time you boot Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
These assistant screens change periodically — and they’re completely 
self-explanatory — so I won’t march you through each one step by step. 
However, here are a few tips that provide a bit of additional over-the-
shoulder help while you’re setting things up.
 
✦ How rude! If you’re outside the United States or other English-speaking 
countries, you should know that Mac OS X defaults to U.S. formats and 
keyboard layouts. Rest assured, though, because Mac OS X does indeed 
provide full support for other languages and keyboard configurations. 
Pet peeve number 1 . . .
The round object that you load into your 
CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive is a disc, not a 
disk, like your hard drive or that flimsy floppy 
that some of the Windows horde still uses. 
Anyone who pretends to talk oh-so-knowingly 
about a CD-ROM disk or DVD disk is likely a 
dweeb, and you should steer as far away from 
that dweeb as possible in the future.

60
Personalizing the Big X
To display these options in the list boxes, click the Show All button at 
the bottom of the assistant screen.
 
✦ Accounts are important. When Mac OS X asks you to create your 
account, don’t forget your password — oh, and they’re case sensitive, 
too, so THIS is different from this or ThiS. It’s a good idea to enter a pass-
word hint, but don’t make that hint too easy to guess. For example, My 
first dog’s name is probably preferable to Plays Seinfeld on TV. Mac OS X 
uses the name and password that you enter to create your account, which 
you use to log in if you set up a multiuser system for several people. 
(More on this in Book III, Chapter 4.) Never write down your passwords, 
either; such crib sheets work just as well for others as for you.
 
✦ I need to fix that. You can click the Back button any time to return to 
previous assistant screens. Mac OS X, being the bright child that it is, 
automatically saves your choices for you, so when you click Continue to 
return, everything is as you left it.
 
✦ Extra stuff. Whether you decide to accept the news, offers, and related-
product information from Apple is your decision. However, it’s only 
right that I point out that you can find this same information on the 
Apple Web site, so there’s no need to engorge your e-mail Inbox unless 
you so desire. (In other words, I turned this off.)
 
✦ Local area network (LAN) connections. If you’re connecting your 
MacBook to a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/
IP) network (or you’re using an Internet router that uses Dynamic Host 
Configuration Protocol [DHCP]), it’s a good idea to click Yes when 
you’re asked whether you should use the configuration supplied by the 
existing server.
 
 DHCP automatically provides the computers on the network with all the 
settings that they need to connect. If that sounds like ancient Sumerian, 
find out more in Book VII, Chapter 1.
 
✦ Do create your MobileMe account! Apple’s MobileMe service just plain 
rocks — especially the iDisk storage that you receive. Again, more on 
this in Book VI, Chapter 4, but take my word for it. Join up, trooper. (The 
trial subscription is free, and it’s easy to upgrade to a full membership if 
you decide that you like the MobileMe benefits. Check Amazon.com for 
discount pricing on your MobileMe subscription.)
 
✦ Have your Mail settings handy. If you set up your trial MobileMe 
account, you can set up your @me.com address without any bother — 
again, this is A Good Thing. However, if you’re setting up an existing 
account, make sure you have all those silly settings and numbers and 
names that your ISP supplied you with when you signed up. This stuff 
includes your e-mail address, mail server variety, user account ID, pass-
word, and outgoing mail server.

✓ Using the keyboard
✓ Running applications
✓ Switching between programs
✓ Opening, saving, and quitting within an application
A
s the folks in Cupertino will tell you, “It’s all about the graphics.” 
They’re right, of course — Mac OS X is a highly visual operating 
system, and using it without a trackpad or mouse is like building Hoover 
Dam with a pocketknife. (And not a particularly sharp pocketknife, either.) 
Therefore, most of this chapter requires you to exercise your trackpad 
finger — I introduce you to little graphical bits such as icons and menus, 
and you discover how to open windows that can display anything from the 
contents of a document to the contents of your hard drive.
On the other hand, any true MacBook power user will tell you that the key-
board is still a useful piece of hardware. Because I want you to be a bona 
fide, well-rounded Mac OS X power user, I also demonstrate those key com-
binations that can save you time, effort, and possible tennis elbow from all 
that pointer-wrangling.
Finally, I lead you through the basic training that you need to run your pro-
grams: how to start them, how to open and save documents, and how to 
quit an application as gracefully as Fred Astaire on his best day.
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
First things first. As the guy on the rocket sled probably yelled, “This is neat, but 
how do you stop it?” Call ’em The Big Three — Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down 
are the Mac OS X commands that you use when you need to take care of busi-
ness away from your computer. All three appear on the friendly Apple menu (Ú) 
at the top-left corner of your Desktop (as shown in friendly Figure 2-1).

62
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
 
Figure 2-1: 
Choose your 
path from 
the Apple 
menu.
 
Each of these options produces a different reaction from your MacBook:
 
✦ Sleep: You don’t need a glass of water or a bedtime story when you put 
Mac OS X to Sleep, which is a power-saving mode that allows you to 
quickly return to your work later. (Waking your laptop up from Sleep 
mode is much faster than booting or restarting it, and Sleep mode can 
conserve battery power on your MacBook.) Depending on the settings 
that you choose in System Preferences — which I discuss in Book III, 
Chapter 3 — your MacBook can power-down the monitor and spin-down 
the hard drives to save wear and tear on your hardware. You can set 
Mac OS X to automatically enter Sleep mode after a certain amount of 
trackpad and keyboard inactivity. To awaken your slumbering super-
computer, just poke the trackpad or press any key on the keyboard. And 
talk about convenience: Savvy MacBook owners like you can put their 
laptops to sleep by simply closing the computer, and wake the beast by 
opening it back up again.
 
✦ Restart: Use Restart if your MacBook has suddenly decided to work 
“outside the box” and begins acting strangely — for instance, if your 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports suddenly lock up or your FireWire 
drive no longer responds. Naturally, you first need to save any work 
that’s open (unless your computer has locked up altogether). You also 
elect to restart Mac OS X when you switch start-up volumes, or switch 
a MacBook to a Windows XP or Vista partition using Boot Camp. (Many 

Book II
Chapter 2
Navigating and 
Running Programs
63
Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
applications and Apple software updates require a restart after you 
install them.)
 
✦ Shut Down: When you’re ready to return to the humdrum, real world 
and you’re done with your MacBook for the time being, use the Shut 
Down option. Well-behaved Mac applications automatically prompt you 
to save any changes that you’ve made to open documents before the 
computer actually turns itself off (or restarts itself). If you’ve configured 
your MacBook with multiple accounts — and you use the default login 
security settings in the Accounts pane in System Preferences — you can 
shut down Mac OS X from the login screen as well.
Besides the Apple menu command, all MacBooks have a Power key on the 
keyboard that you can press to display the dialog that you see in Figure 2-2. 
If you change your mind and decide to tie up loose ends before you leave, 
click the Cancel button to return to Mac OS X.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Will that 
be Restart, 
Sleep, or 
Shut Down?
 
 
Your MacBook has a Drive Eject key that you can use to load and eject discs. 
You can hold down the Control key and press the Drive Eject key to display 
the same restart/sleep/shutdown options.
I should probably also mention the other guys: 
the Log Out command (which you can find 
under the Apple menu) and the User Switch 
menu (at the right side of the Finder menu).
 ✓ Choose Log Out when you’re running your 
MacBook with multiple users and you 
want to completely pass control over to 
another person. All your programs will 
quit, and the other person can take over 
by logging in with his/her account. Mac OS 
X then reconfigures with the other user’s 
preferences.
 ✓ If you’ve enabled Fast User Switching, 
another user can log in from the User Switch 
menu. However, your applications don’t 
quit, you don’t have to formally log out, and 
you can take control back when the other 
user is finished. (Hence the words Fast and 
Switching in the name.) To turn on this fea-
ture, log in with an administrator account, 
display the Accounts pane in System 
Preferences, click Login Options, and then 
select the Enable Fast User Switching 
check box. (More on Fast User Switching 
appears in Book III, Chapter 4.)
Actually, we’re not finished just yet . . .

Restarting, Sleeping, and Shutting Down
Living the trackpad lifestyle
As a MacBook owner, the trackpad is your primary navigational tool. You 
move your finger over the surface of the trackpad, and the pointer fol-
lows like an obedient pup. The faster you move your finger, the farther the 
pointer goes. You click an item by tapping once on the trackpad — it opens, 
you do your thing, and life is good.
However, you can always customize how your trackpad operates! For exam-
ple, click the System Preferences icon in the Dock, then click the Trackpad 
icon. From here you can:
 
✦ Enable the Clicking check box. Now, when you tap the trackpad 
quickly, your Mac laptop counts that as a click, and two fast taps act as 
a double-click.
 
✦ Enable the Tap Trackpad Using Two Fingers for Secondary Click 
check box. Suddenly a single tap with two fingers displays the right-click 
menu (which I cover in more detail in a paragraph or two).
 
✦ Adjust your tracking speed. Click and drag the Tracking speed slider to 
speed up or slow down the rate at which your pointer moves.
The latest crop of MacBooks have the smart-
est trackpads on the planet! That’s because 
Apple now includes a feature called Multi-
Touch, which allows you to control the view of 
a document by using specific finger motions on 
the trackpad. At the time of this writing, here’s 
the rundown:
 ✓ Two-finger zooming: Pinching your thumb 
and first fingertip toward each on the 
trackpad other zooms in on a document or 
image. The reverse (moving your fingertips 
away from each other) zooms out. You can 
also enable zooming with a modifier key — 
see the description of the Trackpad pane 
in Book III, Chapter 3 for more information.
 ✓ Two-finger rotating: Rotate your thumb 
and first fingertip in a circle on the track-
pad to rotate an image or document in the 
corresponding direction.
 ✓ Three-finger paging: Move your thumb 
and first two fingertips to the left or right 
across your trackpad to page through a 
document or move to the next or previous 
image in a set.
Unfortunately, Multi-Touch doesn’t work with 
every application, but support for this neat fea-
ture is rapidly being added by Apple software 
developers. (For now, I recommend you try out 
your fingertips in iPhoto and Pages!)

A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
“And in the beginning, there was the window.” As with older Mac operat-
ing systems, most of what you’ll do in Mac OS X occurs within these fancy 
frames. And, as you might imagine, a number of controls are at your dis-
posal, which you can use to control the size, shape, and appearance of these 
potent portals. In this section, I — well, to be blunt, I do windows. (No squee-
gee jokes, if you please.)
Opening and closing windows
Windows are generally opened automatically. Usually, a window gets opened 
by an application (when you first run it or it needs to display a document) or 
by Mac OS X itself (when the Finder opens a window to display the contents 
of your hard drive). The Finder, by the way, is the application that Mac OS X 
runs to display the operating system’s menus and windows.
Some programs even let you open new windows on the fly; for example, 
Figure 2-3 illustrates a window in its purest form: a new Finder window. 
To display this window on your own MacBook, choose File➪New Finder 
Window or press Ô+N. From here, you can reach any file on your MacBook 
or even venture to the Internet.
 
Figure 2-3: 
You’re ready 
to navigate 
with this 
Finder 
window.
 
Close button

66
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
 
The Command key usually has both an Apple (Ú) and a rather strange-
looking symbol (Ô) on it that I often call the Spirograph.
When you’re finished with a document or you no longer need a window open, 
you can close it to free that space on your Desktop. To close a window in Mac 
OS X, move your pointer over the Close button; it’s the red circular button at 
the top-left corner of the window (see Figure 2-3). An X appears on the button 
when you’re in the zone. When the X appears, just tap the trackpad.
 
If you’ve been living the life of a hermit in a cave for the last decade or so, 
pressing the button on a mouse or trackpad is called clicking. In fact, today’s 
MacBooks don’t have any buttons at all! (You tap the trackpad with one 
finger to click.) If you’re using an external pointing device (like an Apple 
Mighty Mouse, a trackball, or any pointing device with a right button), a 
right-click usually acts the same as holding down the Control key while you 
click with an older one-button Apple mouse or trackpad.
 
Never use any object other than your finger on the trackpad! That means 
no pencils (no, not even the eraser end), pens, or chopsticks; they can 
damage your trackpad in no time at all.
Most Mac applications don’t want you closing a window willy-nilly if you’ve 
changed the contents without saving them. For example, try to close a 
document window in Word or Pages without saving the file first. The pro-
gram asks you for confirmation before it closes the window containing your 
Great American Novel. Most programs also have a Close command on their 
File menu. (Here’s another indicator: Most programs display a black dot in 
the center of the program’s Close button to indicate that there are unsaved 
changes.)
 
To close all windows that are displayed by a particular program, hold down 
the Option key while you click the Close button on one of the windows. 
Whoosh! They’re all gone.
Scrolling windows
Often, more stuff is in a document or more files are on your hard drive than 
you can see in the space available for a window. Guess that means it’s time 
to delete stuff. No, no, just joking! You don’t have to take such drastic mea-
sures to see more in a window.
Just use the scroll bars that you see in Figure 2-4 to move through the con-
tents of the window. You can click the scroll bar and drag it — for the unini-
tiated, that means clicking the bar and holding down your finger on the track-
pad while you move your finger in the desired direction. Alternatively, you 
can click in the empty area above or below the bar to scroll pages one at a 
time. If you’ve enabled two-finger scrolling in the Trackpad pane within System 
Preferences, you can scroll by dragging two fingers across the trackpad.

Depending on the type of application that you’re using, you might be able to 
scroll a window with your arrow keys as well — or perhaps use the Page Up 
and Page Down keys to move through a window.
Minimizing and restoring windows
The multitalented Figure 2-4 also displays another control that you can use 
with a window: the Minimize button. When you minimize a window, you 
eliminate it from your Desktop and store it safely in the Dock — that strip of 
icons that appears along the bottom (or the side) of your Mac OS X Desktop. 
In fact, a minimized window appears as a miniature icon in the Dock, so you 
can actually keep an eye on it (so to speak). Figure 2-5 illustrates a mini-
mized window from Safari, which is actually displaying my Web site at www.
mlcbooks.com. To minimize a window, move your pointer over the yellow 
Minimize button at the top-left corner of the window — a minus sign appears 
on the button — and then click.
 
You’re gonna love this “Easter egg” hidden in Mac OS X — if you hold down 
the Shift key whilst you minimize, the window shrinks in cool slow motion. 
(Who says operating systems have to be totally serious, anyway?)

68
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
 
Figure 2-5: 
Note the 
miniature 
Web page in

When you’re ready to display the window again on your Desktop — a pro-
cess called restoring the window — simply click the thumbnail icon repre-
senting the window in the Dock, and Mac OS X automagically returns it to its 
former size and location.
By the way, some — note that I said some — applications continue to run 
when minimized, whereas others simply stop or pause until you return them 
to the Desktop. Such is the crazy world we live in.
Zooming windows
Zooming windows has a kind of Flash Gordon sound to it, don’t you think? 
It’s nothing quite that exciting — no red tights or laser guns — still, when 
you’re trying to view a larger portion of a document, zooming is a good thing 
because it expands the window to the maximum practical size for the appli-
cation that you’re using (and the content being displayed). In some cases, 
zooming a window fills the entire screen; in others, the extra space would 
be wasted, so the application zooms the window to the maximum size that 
shows as much content as possible (without any unnecessary white space). 
In fact, the Zoom button can even be disabled by an application that doesn’t 
want you to muck about with the window; for example, I own some games 
that don’t allow zooming.
To zoom a window, move your pointer over the green Zoom button at the 
top-left corner of the window. Again, Figure 2-4 (a couple of sections back) 
struts its stuff and illustrates the position. (Man, that is one versatile figure.) 
A plus sign appears on the Zoom button. Click to expand your horizons.
 
After you’ve finished with a zoomed window, you can return it to its previ-
ous dimensions by clicking the Zoom button again.
Toggling toolbars
If you’re wondering what that little lozenge-shaped button is at the right 
corner of many Mac OS X application windows, I won’t leave you in sus-
pense: This button toggles the display of the window’s toolbar on and off. 
A toolbar is a strip of icons that appears across the top of a window that 
you can click to perform common commands, such as changing the display 

Book II
Chapter 2
Navigating and 
Running Programs
69
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
format or printing the current document. (The toolbar in Figure 2-4, for 
example, features icons to move Back and Forward, among others.) You’ll 
encounter more toolbar technology throughout the book.
Moving windows
In contrast to the rather permanent windows in your home, you can pick a 
window and cart it to another portion of the Desktop. Typically, you do this 
when you’re using more than one application at a time and you need to see 
the contents of multiple windows. To grab a window and make off with it, click 
the window’s title bar — the strip at the top of the window that usually bears 
a document or application name — and drag your finger (and the window) to 
the new location. (Don’t click the icon in the title bar, however — you want to 
click the title bar itself.) Then release your finger to plant the window firmly in 
the new location.
 
By the way, some applications allow you to arrange multiple windows in a 
graceful swoop with a single click of a menu. Click the Window menu and 
choose Arrange All to perform this magic.
I talk about Exposé and Spaces later, in the section “Switching ’Twixt Programs 
with Aplomb.” Exposé helps you organize a large number of open windows 
on your Desktop. You can use it to display all open application windows 
so that you can pick the one you want . . . or even display all the windows 
opened by a specific application. Spaces allows you to create entire custom 
virtual desktops. (Truly cool.) Each of your Spaces desktops can contain a 
different set of application windows that you use for different tasks!
Resizing windows
Next, consider how to change the width or height of your window. To 
change the dimensions of a window to your exact specifications, move your 
pointer over the lower-right corner of the window (which is usually marked 
with a number of slashed lines to indicate its status as a control), click, and 
drag until the window is the size that you prefer.
Switching windows
Before I move on to other graphical wonders of Mac OS X, it’s important that 
you master how to switch between windows on your Desktop. First, remem-
ber this old Norwegian saying (or is it one of Mark’s Maxims?):
 
Only one can be active at one time.
What our Oslo friends are communicating is that only one window can be 
active at any time. The active window appears on top of other windows, and 
it’s the one that you can edit by typing or by moving your pointer. (It also 
sports Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons in color.) Other windows that 

70
A Window Is Much More Than a Frame
you have opened might be minimized, as I describe earlier, in the section 
“Minimizing and restoring windows,” or they can be inactive (mere ghosts 
of themselves) and remain on your Desktop. Mac OS X dims the controls for 
inactive windows so that you can tell they’re hanging around . . . but you 
can’t use them at the moment. Figure 2-6 illustrates a number of open win-
dows, with the iTunes window active.
I know you’re going to get tired of hearing me say this, but here I go again: 
Certain applications continue to run while their windows are inactive, such 
as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients and others. Most programs, however, 
stop or pause until you make their window active.
And how do you switch to — activate — a different window in Mac OS X? Again, 
Exposé allows you to activate another window, but if the window is currently 
visible, you can simply click any part of that window. I generally click the win-
dow’s title bar if it’s visible, but any part of the inactive window will do. (You 
can also right-click the application’s icon in the Dock and choose the desired 
window from the menu.) The window that you click leaps like a proud stallion 
to the fore, and the previously active window now skulks in the background.
 
You can still use a window’s Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons even when 
the window is inactive.
 
Figure 2-6: 
Many are 
open, but 
only one is 
active.

Menu Mysteries Explained
Menu Mysteries Explained
Next, I move on to menu control in Mac OS X. Menus are handy drop-down 
controls that allow you to select commands that are grouped together logi-
cally. For example, an application’s File menu usually allows you to create 
or open a document, save a document to disk, or print a document. To pull 
down a menu, click the desired menu group name on the bar at the top of 
the screen and then click the desired menu option from the extended menu.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the Safari menu: Note the submenus designated by 
right-arrow icons. When you move your pointer over a submenu command, 
you get another set of even more specific menu commands — in this case, 
the Services submenu command displays commands, such as Mail and Grab.
 
Some applications allow you to create your own custom menus; naturally, 
configuring a new menu system takes some time to figure out, but imagine 
the productivity gains that you’ll enjoy! For example, my menus in Microsoft 
Word 2008 for Mac feature only the commands that I use often — they’re 
sleeker and easier to navigate. (However, you have to stop short of claiming 
that you wrote the application. And yes, I already checked with Microsoft, 
which got downright snippy about it.)
 
Figure 2-7:

Safari’s

72
Icons ’R Us
Mac OS X also provides another type of menu: contextual. A contextual 
menu appears when you hold down the Control key and click certain items 
on the screen, revealing commands that relate specifically to that item. 
(Unfortunately, the items that sport contextual menus vary from application 
to application, so it’s best to check the documentation for a program before 
you spend countless hours Control-clicking everything on-screen.) The same 
items in the Control-click menu appear when you select an item and then 
click the Action pop-up menu, which looks like a mechanical gear.
 
As I mention earlier, Apple’s current crop of desktop and laptop pointing 
devices all have methods (such as a right-click) of activating a contextual 
menu. Many manufacturers sell mice, trackballs, and other pointing things 
that include a secondary button. Generally, if you have a pointing device 
with multiple buttons, the device displays contextual menus when you click 
the secondary button. Then again, you might launch Aunt Harriet into a geo-
synchronous orbit, so double-check the manual for your pointing thing on 
the default button assignment (and how to change it, if necessary).
You’ll note that many commands in menus have keyboard shortcuts. Because 
I hold forth on this subject in the upcoming section, “Keyboard Shortcuts for 
the True Power User,” I hold off describing those shortcuts here.
Icons ’R Us
Icons are more than little pictures. They’re . . . well . . . actually, I guess 
they’re little pictures. However, these graphical WUDs (that’s short for 
Wonderful User Devices) are really representations of the components of 
your Mac OS X system, and therefore they deserve a section of their own.
 
For complete details on what any icon is, what it represents, and what it does, 
click the icon once to highlight it and then press Ô+I. This displays the Info 
dialog that you see in Figure 2-8, which tells you what kind of icon it is, where 
the item it represents is actually located, and how big it is. You also see a ver-
sion number for applications — a handy way of quickly checking the version 
of a program you’re running — and when the file was created and last modi-
fied. The Info dialog also offers other settings and options that you can display 
by clicking in the General section, and I cover them in other parts of the book.
Hardware
Mac OS X uses icons to represent the various hardware devices of your 
MacBook, including your
 
✦ Hard drive or solid-state drive
 
✦ DVD drive (if a disc is loaded)
 
✦ iPod

You get the idea. Just double-click a hardware icon to display the folders 
and files that it contains, as you do with your hard drive and a disc loaded in 
your DVD drive.
Generally, you’ll encounter hardware icons only on your Desktop or in 
Finder windows, or within a device or source list in applications such as 
iTunes and iPhoto. Figure 2-9 illustrates some of the hardware icons that live 
in my system.

Icons ’R Us
Programs and applications
These are the fancy icons, folks. Most applications have their own custom 
icons, and double-clicking one typically whisks you on your way. Mac OS X 
also includes a generic icon or two for applications that don’t include their 
own custom icon. Figure 2-10 illustrates a number of my favorite program 
icons from all sorts of Mac OS X applications.
Running a program in Mac OS X can be as simple as double-clicking the 
application icon — more on this later, in the section “Houston, We’re Go to 
Launch Programs.”
 
Figure 2-10: 
Most Snow 
Leopard 
applications

Files
Your hard drive will contain many thousands of individual files, and the Big 
X tries to make it as easy as possible to identify visually which application 
owns which file. Therefore, most applications use a special icon to indi-
cate their data files. For example, Figure 2-11 illustrates several documents 
and data files created by a range of applications: Microsoft Word, Pages, 
QuickTime, Safari, and Adobe Acrobat. Some cheeky applications even use 
more than one icon to differentiate among different file types, such as docu-
ments and templates in Microsoft Word.
A number of generic file icons indicate text files, including RTF (short for 
rich text format) documents and PDF (Portable Document Format) docu-
ments, which use the Adobe Acrobat format.

You can open most documents and data files by double-clicking them, which

I also recommend Quick Look (the toolbar button is visible in the middle of 
the toolbar in Figure 2-11) for a lightning-fast peek at the contents of a file. 
Click the file once to select it; then click the Quick Look button to view the 
document — all without opening any applications!
Folders
Folders have a 3-D look in Mac OS X — and, as you can see in Figure 2-12, 
some applications even customize their folder icon!

Icons ’R Us
Major system folders — including Applications, Library, System, Users, 
Downloads, and Utilities — sport distinctive folder icons in Snow Leopard 
that help identify their contents.
To open a folder within Mac OS X, just double-click it. (Alternatively, you can 
click it once to select it and then press Ô+O or Ô+↓.) Discover more about 
how to control the look of folder contents in Book III, Chapter 1.
Aliases
An alias is a strange beast. Although it might look like a standard icon, upon 
closer examination, you’ll notice that an alias icon sports a tiny curved 
arrow at the base, and the tag alias often appears at the end of the icon 
name. Figure 2-13 has roped in a variety of aliases for your enjoyment, along 
with one or two actual icons for comparison.

Essentially, an alias is a link to something else on your system. For example, 
a Photoshop alias can run Photoshop just as the actual program icon can, 
but it takes up only a scant few bytes on your hard drive. (If you’re a Switcher 
who’s just crossed over from the Windows Wilderness, think shortcut — 
Windows shortcuts work in a similar manner.) The alias file is just big enough 
to hold the location of the actual file or folder, allowing it to yell at Mac OS X: 
“Hey, the Human actually wants you to run this or open that thing over there!”
Aliases come in handy for a number of reasons:
 
✦ They allow you to launch applications and open files and folders from 
anywhere in your system. For example, you might want an alias icon in 
your MP3 folder that runs the DVD-burning application Toast Titanium. 
With an alias icon, you can launch the application and burn a data DVD 
without laboriously navigating to the Toast Titanium folder, which could 
be nested in goodness-knows-how-many layers of subfolders.
 
✦ They can be easily deleted when no longer needed without wreak-
ing havoc on the original application, file, or folder. If you decide that

Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
you’d rather use iTunes to burn audio CDs, you can simply delete the 
Toast Titanium alias without trashing the application itself.
 
✦ Their tiny size allows you to add multiple aliases (and mucho conve-
nience) for a single application without gulping down hard drive space.
 
You might be wondering, “Why use aliases when I can just copy the actual 
application, file, or folder to the desired spot?” Well, indeed you can do 
that. However, the application might not work in its new location because 
you didn’t copy any of the supporting files that most applications need to 
run. (An alias actually runs the original application or opens the original file 
or folder, so things should work just as if you’d double-clicked the original 
icon.) Additionally, remember that copying applications willy-nilly through-
out your hard drive eats up territory like a horde of angry Vikings.
 
If you dislike the alias hanging off the end of the icon name, feel free to 
rename it (as I show you in Chapter 3 of this minibook). The alias continues 
to function nicely no matter what moniker you give it. (If you create an alias 
by holding down Ô+Option whilst dragging the original icon to a new loca-
tion, the alias name won’t include the alias appendage.)
If the original file no longer exists, an alias naturally no longer works, either. 
However, Mac OS X is sharp enough to automatically “fix” an alias if you 
rename or move the original file, pointing it to the new location (as long as it 
remains on the same volume). Slick!
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
You’ll often find yourself performing different actions on one icon — or a 
number of icons at one time. For example, you can copy or move files from 
one location on your hard drive to another, or delete a group of files that 
you no longer need. (The idea of drag-and-drop file management using icons 
originated on the Macintosh, and in Chapter 3 of this minibook, I describe 
these operations in detail.) In this section, I focus on the basics of selecting 
one or more icons to specify the files and folders you want to use for what-
ever you’re going to do next.
Selecting a single icon
First, here are the various ways that you can select a single icon for an 
impending action:
 
✦ Place your pointer over the file and click once. Mac OS X darkens the icon 
to indicate that it’s selected — a mysterious process called highlighting.
 
✦ Type the first few letter of the icon’s name. After you type a letter, Mac 
OS X highlights the first icon that matches that character.

78
Selecting Icons for Fun and Profit
 
✦ If an icon in a window is already highlighted, you can move the high-
light to the next icon across by pressing the right-arrow key. Likewise, 
the other three directional arrow keys move the highlight in the other 
directions. To move through the icons alphabetically, press Tab to go 
forward and Shift+Tab to go backward.
Selecting multiple icons
To select a gaggle of icons for an action, use one of these methods:
 
✦ If the icons are next to each other, click and drag within the window 
(and not directly on a specific item) to highlight them all. While you 
drag, Mac OS X displays a selection box, and any icons you touch with 
that box are highlighted when you lift your finger (as shown in Figure 
2-14). Think “lasso” and you’ll get the picture.
 
Figure 2-14: 
Dragging 
a selection 
box in Mac 
OS X.
 
 
✦ You can also select multiple adjacent icons by clicking the first item to 
highlight it and then holding down the Shift key while clicking the last 
icon in the series that you want to select.
 
 If the icons are not next to each other, you can hold down the Ô key 
while you click each item that you want to select.
Just selecting an icon doesn’t launch or do anything . . . you’re just marking 
your territory.

Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Keyboard Shortcuts for the True Power User
Virtually all Mac OS X applications have their own keyboard shortcuts — a 
ten-cent term for a key combination that performs the same operation as 
a menu command or a toolbar button. Although the trackpad might seem 
the easier path when controlling your MacBook, it’s not always the fastest. 
Those hardy souls who venture to learn common keyboard shortcuts can 
zip through a spreadsheet or warp through a complex outline at speeds that 
no mere trackpad-wrangler could ever hope to attain.
With that in mind — and with the goal of “pumping you up” into a power 
user — I hereby present the most common keyboard shortcuts for the Big X 
in Table 2-1. I’ve also sprinkled other keyboard shortcuts liberally through 
the book when I discuss other applications, but these combinations are the 
classics that appear virtually everywhere.

By the way, I should mention that many keyboard combinations use three 
different keys instead of just two (and a few even use four). When these 
shortcuts appear in a menu, they look something akin to Egyptian hiero-
glyphics, but you need only hold down the first two keys simultaneously and 
press the third key. Common “strange” key symbols that you’ll see in both 
the Finder and most applications are shown in Table 2-2.

The next stop on your introductory tour of Mac OS X is the launch pad for 
your applications. Although the Finder is useful, you’ll likely want to actually 
do something with your Mac as well.
Running applications from your hard drive
You can launch an application from your hard drive by
 
✦ Navigating to the corresponding application folder — by either clicking 
or double-clicking drive and folder icons — and double-clicking (tapping 
twice) on the application icon.
 
✦ Double-clicking a document or data file that’s owned by the application. 
For example, double-clicking an MP3 audio file runs iTunes.
 
✦ Double-clicking an alias that you’ve created for the application. (Get the 
skinny on aliases in the earlier section, “Aliases.” I’ll wait.)
 
✦ Double-clicking an Automator workflow or compiled AppleScript. (More 
on Automator and AppleScript in Book IX, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Clicking the application’s icon in the Dock. (More on adding items to the 
Dock in Book III, Chapter 2.)

✦ Selecting the application icon and pressing the Ô+O keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Clicking the Menu button on an Apple Remote to display the Front Row 
menu. From here, you can choose to watch a DVD movie (using Apple’s 
DVD Player), peruse your collection of digital images (using iPhoto), 
watch a video you’ve created (using iMovie), or listen to music (using 
iTunes). The applications are launched automatically when you select 
the media you want to play. (You can find more on Front Row in Chapter 
5 of this minibook.)
 
✦ Adding the application to your Login Items list. (I cover the Login Items 
list in more detail in Book III, Chapter 3.)
Running applications from a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
After you load a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, you can display its contents by 
double-clicking the disc icon that appears on your Desktop. A Finder window 
opens and shows the files that reside on the disc. (See Figure 2-15.)

Switching ’Twixt Programs with Aplomb
You might think that juggling multiple applications will lead to confusion, 
fatigue, and dry mouth, but luckily Mac OS X makes it easy to jump between 
programs that are running on your MacBook. Use any of these methods to 
jump from open application to application:
 
✦ Click anywhere in the desired window to make it the active window.
 
✦ Click the application icon in the Dock. All applications that are running 
have an icon in the Dock, and the icon has a shiny dot beneath it to indi-
cate that the application is open.
 
✦ Press Ô+Tab. If you have a dozen windows open, this can get a bit tedious, 
which leads us to one of Snow Leopard’s sassiest features, brazenly 
named Exposé and shown in Figure 2-16. (Am I stretching things a bit?)
 
✦ Press F9 (or F3, depending on your keyboard) to show all open appli-
cation windows using Exposé; then click the one you want. Figure 
2-16 illustrates the tiled window display on my Mac after I press F3. 
The cursor changes into the traditional (and highly elegant) gloved 
hand. Move the cursor on top of the window you want to activate — the 
window turns blue when it’s selected — and click once to switch to that 
window. You can specify which keys you want to use to control Exposé 
within System Preferences.
 
✦ Press F10 (or Control+F3, depending on your keyboard) to show all 
open windows from the application that you’re currently using; then 
click the one that you want to activate. This Exposé function is great 
for choosing from all the images that you’ve opened in Photoshop or all 
the Safari Web pages littering your Desktop!
Along with the window switch, an astute observer will notice that the appli-
cation menu bar also changes to match the now-active application.
 
Besides the F9/F3 and F10/Control+F3 hot keys that I just discussed, Exposé 
provides one more nifty function: Press F11 (or Ô+F3), and all your open 
windows scurry to the side of the screen. (Much like a herd of zebras if you 
dropped a lioness in the middle.) Now you can work with drives, files, and 
aliases on your Desktop — and when you’re ready to confront those dozen 
application windows again, just press the keyboard shortcut a second time.
Ah, but what if you want to switch to an entirely different set of applications? 
For example, let’s suppose that you’re slaving away at your pixel-pushing 
job — designing a magazine cover with Pages. Your page design desktop 
also includes Photoshop and Aperture, which you switch between often 
using one of the techniques I just described. Suddenly, however, you realize 
you need to schedule a meeting with others in your office using iCal, and you 
want to check your e-mail in Apple Mail. What to do?

Well, you could certainly launch those two applications on top of your 
graphics applications, and then minimize or close them . . . but with 
Snow Leopard’s Spaces feature, you can press the Control+Left Arrow or 
Control+Right Arrow sequences to switch to a completely different “com-
munications” desktop, with iCal and Apple Mail windows already open and 
in your favorite positions! (Figure 2-17 illustrates the Spaces screen, showing 
two available desktops.)
After you’re done setting up your meeting and answering any important e-mail, 
simply press Control+Left Arrow or Control+Right Arrow again to switch back to 
your “graphics” desktop, where all your work is exactly as you left it!
Now imagine that you’ve also created a custom “music” desktop for 
GarageBand and iTunes . . . or perhaps you paired iWeb, MobileMe, and 
iPhoto together as a “Webmaster” desktop. See why everyone’s so excited? 
(Let’s see Windows Vista do that out of the box.)
In contrast to Exposé, Spaces has to be enabled and configured before you 
can use it. You can create new desktops, customize your desktops, and 
even choose a different set of key sequences to activate Spaces from within 
System Preferences. For the complete story on configuring Spaces, see Book 
III, Chapter 3.

Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
Almost all Mac OS X applications open and save documents in the same way, 
whether you’re creating a presentation with Keynote or expressing your cin-
ematic side with iMovie. Therefore, I take a moment to outline the common 
procedures for opening and saving documents. Believe me, you’ll perform 
these two rituals dozens of times a week, so no nodding off.
Opening a document
First, the simple way to load a document: Double-click that document in a 
Finder window, and . . . well, that’s it. (This is my preferred method because 
I’m an ALT — short for Admitted Lazy Techno-wizard — who would rather 
use complex hand movements to pour myself another Diet Coke.)
To open a document the hard way — from inside an application — here’s 
the plan:
 
1. Choose File➪Open or press that handy Ô+O key combination.
 
 Your Mac OS X program is likely to display the attractive Open dialog 
that you see in Figure 2-18.

Running Programs
85
Opening and Saving Your Stuff in an Application
 
Figure 2-18: 
The soon-
to-be-quite-
familiar 
Open dialog.
 
 
2. Navigate to the location of the document that you want to open.
 
 The pop-up menu allows you to jump directly to common locations — 
such as the Desktop, your Home folder, and your iDisk — as well as 
places that you’ve recently accessed (Recent Places).
 
 If the target folder isn’t in your pop-up menu, move the slider at the 
bottom of the dialog to the far left to display your hard drives, DVD 
drives, and network locations.
 
3. Click the habitat where the file will be found.
 
 You’ll note that the right column(s) changes to show you the contents 
of the item that you just clicked. In this way, you can cruise through 
successive folders to find that elusive document. (This time-consuming 
process is somewhat derisively called drilling — hence, the importance 
of using Recent Items, or dragging files, locations, and applications into 
the sidebar at the left of the Finder.)
 
4. When you sight the document that you want to load, either double-
click it or click once to highlight the filename and then click Open.
 
“Hey, the Open dialog can be resized!” That’s right, good buddy — you can 
expand the Open dialog to show more columns and find things more easily. 
Click and drag the bottom-right corner of the Open dialog to resize it. (You 
can also switch from column view to list view or icon view, just as you can in 
a Finder window, using the buttons to the left of the pop-up location menu.)

86
Quitting Programs
Saving a document
To save a document, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Save.
 
 If you’ve previously saved this document, your application should imme-
diately overwrite the existing document with the new copy, and you get 
to return to work . . . end of story. If you haven’t previously saved this 
document, the program displays a Save dialog that’s usually very similar 
to the Open dialog; it generally has a few more options, however, so stay 
frosty.
 
2. Navigate to the location where you’d like to save the document and 
then type a filename.
 
 Often, you can use a default name that’s already provided by the 
thoughtful folks who developed the software. Note that you might be 
given the chance to save the document in several different formats. For 
example, a word processing application might allow you to save a docu-
ment in RTF, HyperText Markup Language (HTML), and even bargain-
basement text format.
 
3. Click Save (or OK, depending on the application).
 
If an application offers a Save As menu option in the File menu, you can in 
effect copy the document by saving a new version of the document under 
another name. Save As comes in particularly handy when you want to retain 
the original version of a document.
Quitting Programs
If I had a twisted and warped sense of humor, I’d simply tell you to quit 
applications by pulling your MacBook’s power cord from the wall socket. 
(Luckily, I don’t. Besides, it wouldn’t work anyway, because your laptop’s 
battery would automatically kick in!) There are, however, more sane ways to 
exit a program — use one of these methods instead:
 
✦ Press the Ô+Q keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Choose the Application’s named menu and then click Quit.
 
✦ Right-click the application icon in the Dock and click Quit on the pop-up 
menu that appears.
You can also click the Close button on the application window. Note, how-
ever, that this doesn’t always completely close down the application. For 
example, Safari stays running even if you close the browser window. In 
general, if the application works within a single window (such as System 
Preferences), closing the window also quits the application.

fter you master basic Mac spell-casting — things like selecting items,

and launching an application or two — it’s time to delve deeper into Mac 
OS X. (Can you tell I’m a Dungeons & Dragons old-timer?)
In this chapter, I discuss file management, showing you the hidden power 
behind the friendly Apple menu. I also discuss some of the more advanced 
menu commands, how to print within most applications, and how to listen 
to an audio CD on your MacBook. (It makes a doggone good stereo.) Finally, 
I introduce you to the built-in CD/DVD recording features within the Big X 
and adding a standard USB printer to your system.
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
So what exactly is the Finder, anyway? It’s a rather nebulous term, but in 
essence, the Finder gives Mac OS X the basic functions that you use for the 
procedures I outline in this chapter. This multitasking uber OS has been 
around in one guise or another since the days of System 6 — the creaking 
old days when a Mac was an all-in-one, toteable computer with a built-in 
screen. Come to think of it, some things never change.

88
The Finder: It’s the Wind beneath Your Wings
The Finder is always running, so it’s always available — and you can always 
switch to it, even when several other applications are open and chugging 
away. Figure 3-1 illustrates the Dock with the rather perspective-crazy Finder 
icon at the far-left side.

Is that icon supposed to be one face or two faces? I’m still confused, and I’ve 
been using the Mac now since 1989.
 
Don’t forget that Mac OS X gives you a second method of doing everything 
I cover in this chapter: You can use Terminal to uncover the UNIX core of 
Mac OS X, employing your blazing typing speed to take care of things from 
the command line. Of course, that’s not the focus of this book, but for those 
who want to boldly go where no Mac operating system has ever gone before, 
you’ll find more in Book IX, Chapter 1. Despite what you might have been 
led to believe, power and amazing speed are to be found in character-based 
computing.

Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Copying and Moving Files and Folders
Here’s where drag-and-drop makes things about as easy as computing can get:
 
✦ To copy a file or folder from one window to another location on the 
same drive: Hold down the Option key and click and drag the icon from 
its current home to the new location. (Note: You can drop files and fold-
ers on top of other folders, which puts the copy inside that folder.) If 
you’re copying multiple items, select them first (read how in Book II, 
Chapter 2) and then drag and drop the entire crew.
 
 “Is the Desktop a valid target location for a file or folder?” You’re darn 
tootin’! I recommend, though, that you avoid cluttering up your Desktop 
with more than a handful of files. Instead, create a folder or two on your 
Desktop and then store those items within those folders. If you work 
with the contents of a specific folder often, drag it into the Places head-
ing in the Sidebar (the column at the left side of any Finder window), and 
you can open that folder from the Finder with a single click — no matter 
where you are! (Alternatively, drag the folder to the Dock and drop it 
there, and you can open it with a single click from anywhere.)
 
✦ To copy items from one window to a location on another drive: Click 
and drag the icon from the window to a window displaying the contents 
of the target drive. Or, in the spirit of drag-and-drop, you can simply 
drag the items to the drive icon, which places them in the root folder of 
that drive.
 
✦ To move items from one window to a location on another drive: Hold 
down the Ô key while you drag the items to the target drive icon (plac-
ing them in the root folder of that drive) or to a window displaying the 
contents of the target drive.
 
✦ To move items from one window to another location on the same 
drive: Simply drag the icon to the new location, whether it be a window 
or a folder.
Mac OS X provides you with a number of visual cues to let you know what’s 
being copied or moved. For example, dragging one or more items displays 
a ghost image of the items, and when you’ve positioned the pointer over 
the target, Mac OS X highlights that location to let you know that you’re in 
the zone. If you’re moving or copying items into another Finder window, the 
window border is highlighted to let you know that Mac OS X understands 
the game plan.
 
In case you move the wrong thing or you port it to the wrong location, press 
Ô+Z to undo the previous action.

90
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
If the item that you’re dragging already exists in the target location, you get 
a confirmation dialog like the one you see in Figure 3-2. You can choose to 
replace the file, leave the existing file alone, or stop the entire shooting match.
 
Figure 3-2: 
To replace 
or not to 
replace — 
the choice 
is yours.
 
Cloning Your Items — It’s Happening Now!
No need for sci-fi equipment or billions in cash — you can create an exact 
duplicate of any item within the same folder. (This is often handy when you 
need a simple backup of the same file in the same folder or when you plan to 
edit a document but you want to keep the original intact.)
Click the item to select it and then choose File➪Duplicate (or use the key-
board shortcut and press Ô+D). To distinguish the duplicate from the origi-
nal, Mac OS X adds the word copy to the end of the duplicate’s icon name; 
additional copies have a number added to the name as well.
Alternatively, drag-and-drop aficionados can hold down the Option key and 
drag the original item to another spot in the same window. When you release 
the button, the duplicate appears. You can create a clone in another location 
(such as another window or folder) by holding down the Option key while 
dragging the original item to its new location.
Heck, if you prefer the Control key, you can hold it down while clicking the 
item and then choose Duplicate from the contextual menu that appears. 
Decisions, decisions. . . .
 
Oh, and don’t forget that Action button (it looks like a little gear with a 
downward-pointing arrow) on the Finder toolbar (refer to Figure 3-1). 
You can also click the Action button and choose Duplicate from the pop-up 
menu.
When you duplicate a folder, Mac OS X automatically duplicates all the 
contents of the folder as well. Remember that this could take some time if 
the folder contains a large number of small files (or a small number of large 
files). Groucho would’ve loved computers!

Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
Deleting That Which Should Not Be
Even Leonardo da Vinci made the occasional design mistake — his trash can 
was likely full of bunched-up pieces of parchment. Luckily, no trees will be 
wasted when you decide to toss your unneeded files and folders; this section 
shows you how to delete items from your system.
 
By the way, as you’ll soon witness for yourself, moving items to the Trash 
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re immediately history.
Dragging unruly files against their will
In Mac OS X, the familiar Macintosh Trash can has been moved to the right 
edge of the Dock — in fact, it’s now a spiffy-looking wire can instead of the 
old clunker that the Mac faithful remember. You can click and drag the items 
that you’ve selected to the Trash and drop them on top of the wire can icon 
to delete them. When the Trash contains at least one item, the wire can icon 
changes to appear as if it were full of trash.
 
You can also add a Delete icon to your Finder toolbar. For all the details, see 
Book III, Chapter 1.
Deleting with the menus and the keyboard
It isn’t absolutely necessary to drag a file to the Trash to delete it. Your 
other options for scrapping selected files include
 
✦ Choosing File from the Finder menu and choosing the Move to Trash 
menu item
 
✦ Pressing the Ô+Delete keyboard shortcut
 
✦ Clicking the Action button on the Finder toolbar and selecting Move to 
Trash from the pop-up menu
 
✦ Right-clicking the item to display the contextual menu and then choos-
ing Move to Trash from that menu
Emptying That Wastepaper Basket
As I mention earlier, moving items to the Trash doesn’t actually delete them 
immediately from your system. Believe me, this fail-safe measure comes in 
handy when you’ve been banging away at the keyboard for several hours 
and you stop paying close attention to what you’re doing. (I usually also 
blame lack of Diet Coke.) More on how to rescue files from the Trash in the 
next section.

92
WAIT! I Need That After All!
 
As you can with any folder, you can check the contents of the Trash by click-
ing its icon in the Dock.
After you double-check the Trash contents and you’re indeed absolutely 
sure that you want to delete its contents, use one of the following methods 
to nuke the digital Bit Bucket:
 
✦ Choose the Empty Trash menu item from the Finder menu.
 
✦ Choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu.
 
 Believe it or not, if you use the standard Empty Trash command, you 
still haven’t completely zapped that refuse! Some third-party hard drive 
repair and recovery programs will allow an uncool person to restore 
items from the Trash. Use the Secure Empty Trash method for those 
sensitive files and folders that you want to immediately and irrevoca-
bly delete — the data is overwritten with random characters, making 
it impossible to recover. (A great idea for that Mac you want to sell on 
eBay, no? In fact, if you like, you can reinstall Mac OS X before you ship 
the Mac, leaving the Setup Assistant ready-to-run for the new owner.)
 
✦ Press the Ô+Shift+Delete keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Click the Trash icon in the Dock and hold your finger down on the track-
pad until the menu appears, then choose Empty Trash.
 
✦ Right-click the Trash icon in the Dock and then choose Empty Trash 
from the contextual menu that appears.
Depending on the method you select and the settings you choose in System 
Preferences (which I cover in Book III, Chapter 3), Mac OS X might pres-
ent you with a confirmation dialog to make sure that you actually want the 
Trash emptied.
WAIT! I Need That After All!
In the adrenaline-inducing event that you need to rescue something that 
shouldn’t have ended up in the scrap pile, first click the Trash icon in the 
Dock to display the contents of the Trash. Then rescue the items that you 
want to save by dragging them to the Desktop or a folder on your hard drive. 
(This is roughly analogous to rescuing your old baseball glove from the 
family garage sale.)
Feel free to gloat. If someone else is nearby, ask her to pat you on the back 
and call you a lifesaver.

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
Renaming Your Items
You wouldn’t get far in today’s spacious virtual world without being able to 
change a moniker for a file or folder. To rename an item in Mac OS X, use one 
of these two methods:
 
✦ With the trackpad: Click an icon’s name once (or just press Return). 
Mac OS X highlights the text in an edit box. Type the new name and then 
press Return.
 
 You want to wait a few seconds between clicks, as opposed to doing a 
rapid-fire double-click.
 
✦ From the Info dialog: Select the item and press Ô+I to display the Info 
dialog; then click the triangle next to Name & Extension. Click in the 
name field, drag to highlight the text that you want to change, and type 
the replacement text.
Naturally, the first method is the easiest, and it’s the one that I use most often.
Adding a Dash of Color
Snow Leopard also provides the ability to color-code files and folders to 
help you organize and recognize your data in a hurry. For example, why not 
assign the green label color to the files and folders that make up your cur-
rent project? Or, if you need to mark a file for immediate attention, assign it 
the red label color.
To assign a label color to selected files and folders, you have three options:
 
✦ Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click the desired 
color.
 
✦ Right-click the selection and then choose the color from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Click File and choose that perfect shade from the menu.
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
The Finder’s Info dialog is the place to view the specifics on any highlighted 
item (including drives and aliases). Select an item and press Ô+I, click the 
Action toolbar button and then select Get Info from the menu, right-click and 
choose Get Info, or choose the Finder’s File menu and then choose Get Info 

94
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
(see the results in Figure 3-3). If you select more than one item (up to ten 
items), Snow Leopard opens a separate Info dialog for each item.
 
Figure 3-3: 
The General 
information 
panel 
appears first 
when you 
display the 
Info dialog.
 
Mac OS X displays the General information panel when you first open the 
Info dialog, but other panels are usually available (depending on the type 
of selected items). To display the other panels, click the panel that you want 
to see.
For most types of files and folders, the Info dialog can tell you
 
✦ Kind: What type of item it is — for example, whether it’s a file, folder, 
drive, or alias
 
✦ Open with: What program launches automatically when you open the 
selected item
 
✦ Size: The total size of the item (or items, if there are more than ten) that 
you select
 
✦ Where: The actual path on your hard drive where the item is located

Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
 
✦ Dates: The date when the item was created and was last modified
 
✦ Version: The application version number
 
✦ Sharing & Permissions: The privileges that control who can do what to 
the file (more on this later, in Book II, Chapter 6) and whether a file is 
locked in read-only mode
Some of this information you can change, and some can only be displayed. 
To banish the Info dialog from your Desktop, click the dialog’s Close button.
 
You can hide or display various parts of the Info dialog by clicking the tri-
angles next to each section heading.
For the rest of this section, I describe a number of tasks that you can accom-
plish from the Info dialog.
 
If you use a specific document over and over as a basis for different 
revisions, you can enable the Stationery Pad check box on the General 
information panel to use the file as stationery. Opening a stationery file auto-
matically creates a new, untitled version of the file in the linked application; 
this can save you steps compared with duplicating the file or using the Save 
As procedure that I show you in Book II, Chapter 2.
Adding Spotlight comments
Mac OS X provides you with a Spotlight Comments field, where you can 
add more text about the file (and can be matched with Spotlight). I use this 
feature to record the version number of manuscript chapters and programs 
that I create during the course of writing books.
To add a comment, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
 
2. Click in the Spotlight Comments box and type the comment text.
 
 If you need to expand the Spotlight Comments section of the Info dialog, 
click the triangle next to the Spotlight Comments heading. The arrow 
rotates and the Spotlight Comments box appears.
 
3. Close the Info dialog to save the comment.
Displaying extensions
Extensions are alien creatures to most Mac owners. However, these (usu-
ally) three- or four-character add-ons that follow a period at the end of a 
filename have been a mainstay in the Windows and UNIX environments for 

96
Displaying the Facts on Files and Folders
years. An extension identifies what program owns a specific file, and there-
fore which application launches automatically when you double-click that 
file’s icon. Examples of common extensions (and the applications that own 
them) include
 
✦ .pdf: Preview or Adobe Acrobat
 
✦ .doc: Microsoft Word
 
✦ .pages: Apple Pages
 
✦ .key: Apple Keynote
 
✦ .psd: Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements
 
✦ .jpeg or .jpg: Preview, QuickTime, or your image editor
 
✦ .tiff or .tif: Preview or your image editor
 
✦ .htm or .html: Safari or your Web browser of choice
Why would someone want to see a file’s extension? It comes in handy when 
a number of different types of files are linked to the same application. For 
example, if you install Adobe Photoshop, both JPEG and TIFF images have 
virtually the same icon, so it’s sometimes very hard to tell one from the 
other. With extensions displayed, it’s easy to tell what type of file you’re 
looking at.
Follow this procedure to hide or display extensions with your filenames:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item by pressing Ô+I or choosing File➪
Get Info.
 
2. If you need to expand the Name & Extension section of the Info 
dialog, click the triangle next to the Name & Extension heading.
 
3. To display the extension for the selected file, clear the Hide Extension 
check box to disable it.
 
4. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Choosing the application with which to launch a file
So what’s the plan if the wrong application launches when you double-click a 
file? Not a problem: You can also change the linked application from the Info 
dialog as well. (I told you this was a handy toybox, didn’t I?) Follow these 
steps to choose another application to pair with a selected file:
 
1. Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and click Get Info to dis-
play the Info dialog for the item.
 
2. Click the triangle next to the Open With heading to expand it.

3. Click the pop-up menu button.
 
 Mac OS X displays the applications that it feels are best suited to open 
this type of document.
 
4. Select the application that should open the file.
 
 To go completely hog-wild and choose a different application, 
select Other from the pop-up menu. Mac OS X opens a Choose Other 
Application dialog, where you can navigate to and select the application 
you want. (If the application isn’t recognized as recommended, click the 
Enable pop-up menu and choose All Applications.) After you highlight 
the application, click Add.
 
5. To globally update all the documents of the same type to launch the 
application that you chose, click the Change All button.
 
 Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog asking whether you’re sure 
about making this drastic change. Click Continue to update the other 
files of the same type or click Cancel to return to the Info dialog.
 
6. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.
Locking files against evildoers
“Holy Item Insurance, Batman!” That’s right, Boy Wonder: Before I leave the 
friendly land of the Info dialog, every MacBook owner needs to know how 
to protect files and folders from accidental deletion or editing. By locking a 
file, you allow it to be opened and copied — but not changed, renamed, or 
sent to the Trash. Locked items appear in the Finder with a small padlock 
attached to the icon.
To lock or unlock a file, you have to have ownership of the file. I cover privi-
leges in Book III, but on a MacBook where you’ve configured only one admin-
istrator account, you should already have ownership.
 
If you’re considering changing the ownership of a system-owned file, don’t 
do it. You could throw a serious monkey wrench into your Snow Leopard 
system.
To lock a file, follow this procedure:
 
1. Display the Info dialog for the item.
 
2. Select the Locked check box to enable it.
 
 The Locked check box is in the General section of the dialog.
 
3. Close the Info dialog to save your changes.

98
Creating an Alias
Creating an Alias
I mention aliases in Book II, Chapter 2. As I discuss in that chapter, an alias 
acts as a link to an application or document that actually exists elsewhere 
on your system (a handy trick to use when organizing items on your hard 
drive). You have a number of different ways to conjure an alias after you 
select an item:
 
✦ Choose File from the Finder menu and choose the Make Alias menu item. 
(You have to move the alias yourself.)
 
✦ Press the Ô+L keyboard shortcut. (Again, you have to move the new 
alias to its new location.)
 
✦ Click the Action button on the Finder toolbar and then click Make Alias.
 
✦ Right-click the selected item and then choose Make Alias from the con-
textual menu that appears.
In addition, you can hold down the Ô+Option key combination and drag the 
item to the location where you want the alias.
 
Although Mac OS X does a great job in tracking the movements of an original 
and updating an alias, some actions can break the link. For example, if you 
delete the original, the alias is left wandering in search of a home. However, 
all is not lost — when you double-click a broken alias, Mac OS X offers to 
help you fix the alias. This involves browsing through your system to locate 
a new original.
Using the Apple Menu
The Apple menu is a familiar sight to any Mac owner. Although Apple con-
templated removing it during the original development and beta cycle for 
Mac OS X version 10.0, the ruckus and cry from beta-testers ensured that it 
remains today. It’s amazing how reassuring that little fellow can be when you 
boot the Big X for the first time.
In this section, I cover the important things that are parked under the Apple 
menu.
Using Recent Items
If you’re like most of us — and I think I’m safe in assuming that you are — 
you tend to work on the same set of applications and files (and use the same 
network servers) during the day. Normally, this would be somewhat of a 

Book II
Chapter 3

Housekeeping

Using the Apple Menu
pain because each time you sit down in front of the keyboard, you have to drill 
down through at least one layer of folders to actually reach the stuff that you 
need. To make things easier on yourself, you could create a set of aliases on 
your Desktop that link to those servers, files, and applications . . . but as you 
moved from project to project, you’d find yourself constantly updating the 
aliases. As Blackbeard the Pirate was wont to exclaim, “Arrgh!”
Ah, but Mac OS X is a right-smart operating system, and several years ago, 
Apple created the Recent Items menu to save you the trouble of drilling 
for applications and files (and even network servers as well). Figure 3-4 
illustrates the Recent Items menu from my system. Note that the menu 
is thoughtfully divided into Applications, Documents, and Servers. When 
you open documents or launch applications, they’re added to the list. 
(Accountants will revel in this First In, First Out technology.) To launch an 
application or document from the Recent Items menu — or connect to a net-
work server — just click it.
To wipe the contents of the Recent Items menu — for example, if you’ve just 
finished a project and want to turn over a new digital leaf — click Recent 
Items and choose the Clear Menu item.

100
Using the Apple Menu
You can specify the number of recent items that will appear in the menu 
from System Preferences; display the Appearance pane and click the 
Applications, Documents, and Servers list boxes in the Number of Recent 
Items field. (More on this in Book III, Chapter 3.)
 
Also, remember the trick that I mention earlier: You can drag any folder or 
server into the Sidebar column at the left of a Finder window, adding it to 
that exclusive club that includes your Home folder and Applications folder.
Playing with the Dock
You know how Air Force One acts as the mobile nerve center for the presi-
dent? And how The Chief can jet all around the world and take all his stuff 
along with him? Well, the Dock is kind of like that. Sort of.
If you want your Dock to go mobile as well, click the Apple menu and choose 
the Dock item to display the submenu. Here’s a rundown of the options that 
you’ll find:
 
✦ Hiding: Click Turn Hiding On/Off to toggle the automatic hiding of the 
Dock. With hiding on, the Dock disappears off the edge of the screen 
until you move the pointer to that edge. (This is great for those who 
want to make use of as much Desktop territory as possible for their 
applications.)
 
 You can press Ô+Option+D to toggle Dock hiding on and off from the 
keyboard.
 
✦ Magnification: Click Turn Magnification On/Off to toggle icon magnifica-
tion when your pointer is selecting an icon from the Dock. With magni-
fication on, the icons in the Dock get really, really big . . . a good thing 
for Mr. Magoo or those with grandiose schemes to take over the world. 
Check out the rather oversized icons in Figure 3-5. (The amount of mag-
nification can be controlled from the System Preferences Dock settings, 
which I explain in Book III, Chapter 3.)
 
✦ Position: Click one of three choices (Position on Left, Bottom, or Right) 
to make the Dock appear on the left, bottom, or right of the screen, 
respectively.
 
✦ Dock Preferences: Click this to display the System Preferences Dock set-
tings, which I explain in Book III, Chapter 3.
Bad program! Quit!
Once in a while, you’ll encounter a stubborn application that locks up, slows 
to a crawl, or gets stuck in an endless loop. Although Mac OS X is a highly 
advanced operating system, it can still fall prey to bad programming or cor-
rupted data.

Luckily, you can easily shut down these troublemakers from the Apple menu. 
Just choose Force Quit to display the Force Quit Applications dialog that you 
see in Figure 3-6. (Keyboard types can press Ô+Option+Esc.) Select the appli-
cation that you want to banish and then click the Force Quit button; Mac OS X 
requests confirmation, after which you click the Force Quit button again.
 
Figure 3-6:

If you select Finder in the Force Quit Applications dialog, the button changes

if your system appears to be unstable. (This is much faster than actually 
restarting your MacBook.)
 
Forcing an application to quit will also quit any open documents that you 
were working with in that application, so save your work (if the program 
will allow you to save anything). If you relaunch the Finder, some programs 
might restart as well.
Tracking down your version
This isn’t a big deal, but if you choose About This Mac from the Apple menu, 
Mac OS X displays the About This Mac dialog that you see in Figure 3-7. 
In case you need to check the amount of memory or the processor in an 
unfamiliar Mac, the About This Mac dialog can display these facts in a twin-
kling. However, I primarily use it to check the Mac OS X version and build 
number as well as to launch the Apple System Profiler (which I discuss in 
full in Chapter 7 of this minibook). Click the More Info button to launch the 
Profiler.
 
Figure 3-7:

Apple allows you to launch Software Update from both the About This Mac 
dialog and the Apple menu . . . sheesh, they must really want you to keep 
your Big X up to date, I guess.
Specifying a location
Mac OS X allows you to create multiple network locations. Think of a loca-
tion as a separate configuration that you use when you connect to a different 
network from a different locale. For instance, if you travel to a branch office, 
you’d assign a location for your desk and a location for the remote branch. A 
student might assign one location for her home network and another for the 
college computer lab network.

Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
A location saves all the specific values that you’ve entered in the System 
Preferences Network settings, including IP address, DNS servers, proxy serv-
ers, and the like. If all this means diddly squat to you, don’t worry — I explain 
this in Book VII, Chapter 1. For now, just remember that you can switch between 
locations by choosing Location from the Apple menu, which displays a 
submenu of locations that you can choose from. (You must create at least a 
second location for the Location menu item to appear in the Apple menu.)
Availing Yourself of Mac OS X Services
In Mac OS X, Services allow you to merge information from one application 
with another. To Mac old-timers, that might sound suspiciously like the 
Clipboard; however, Services can also include functionality from an applica-
tion, so you can create new documents or complete tasks without running 
another program! Services can be used in both the Finder and Mac OS X 
applications.
To illustrate, here’s a fun example:
 
1. Launch TextEdit (you’ll find it in your Applications folder) and type 
your name.
 
2. Highlight your name.
 
3. Click the TextEdit menu — don’t switch to the Finder; use the TextEdit 
Application menu — and choose Services.
 
4. From the Services submenu, choose Search in Google.
After you’ve shaken your head at all the sites devoted to people with the 
same name, consider what you just did — you ran the Safari application 
from within TextEdit, using selected words! Pretty slick, eh?
A glance at the other Services that show up within most applications gives 
you an idea of just how convenient and powerful Mac OS X Services can be. I 
often use Services to take care of things such as
 
✦ Sending an e-mail message from an e-mail address in a text file or the 
Address Book (via the Mail Service)
 
✦ Capturing a screen snapshot within an application (using the Grab 
Service)
 
✦ Sending a file to a Bluetooth-equipped PDA or cell phone within an appli-
cation (using the Send File to Bluetooth Device service)
Remember, you can access the Services menu from a Mac OS X application 
by picking that program’s Application menu (sometimes called the named 
menu). For instance, in the demonstration earlier, I use the TextEdit menu 

104
Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
that appears on the TextEdit menu bar. In Microsoft Word, I would click the 
Word menu.
Geez, I think the computing world needs another word for menu — don’t you?
 
Many third-party applications that you install under Mac OS X can add their 
own commands under the Services menu, so be sure to read the documenta-
tion for a new application to see what Service functionality it adds.
Get Thee Hence: Using the Go Menu
Remember the transporter from “Star Trek”? Step on the little platform, 
assume a brave pose, and whoosh! — you’re transported instantaneously to 
another ship or (more likely) to a badly designed planet exterior built inside 
a soundstage. Talk about convenience . . . that is, as long as the doggone 
thing didn’t malfunction.
The Finder’s Go menu gives you the chance to play Captain Kirk: You can 
jump immediately to specific spots, both within the confines of your own 
system as well as external environments, such as your network or the 
Internet. (You can leave your phaser and tricorder in your cabin.)
The destinations that you can travel to using the Go menu and the iDisk sub-
menu include the following:
 
✦ Back/Forward/Enclosing Folder: I lump these three commands together 
because they’re all basic navigation commands. For example, Back and 
Forward operate just as they do in Safari or your favorite Web browser. 
If you’re currently inside a folder, you can return to the parent folder by 
clicking Enclosing Folder.
 
✦ Computer: This window includes your hard drives, CD and DVD drives, 
and your network — the same places that appear when you open a new 
Finder window with the Ô+N key shortcut.
 
✦ Home: This window displays the home directory for the user currently 
logged in.
 
✦ Desktop: This window displays the files and folders that you’ve stored 
on your Snow Leopard desktop.
 
✦ Network: Did you guess that this displays a window with all your net-
work’s servers? Dead giveaway, that.
 
✦ iDisk: This window displays the contents of your Internet iDisk stor-
age (or someone else’s). (More on the coolness that is iDisk in Book VI, 
Chapter 4.)

✦ Documents: Yep, you guessed it: This window displays the contents of 
your Documents folder.
 
✦ Utilities: This window displays the contents of your Mac OS X Utilities 
folder.
 
✦ Recent Folders: This window displays a submenu that allows you to 
choose from the folders that you’ve recently opened.
You can also type the path for a specific folder (use the Go to Folder command) 
or connect to a specific network server (use the Connect to Server command).
Note that most of the Go menu commands include keyboard shortcuts, prov-
ing once again that the fingers are quicker than the trackpad.
Monkeying with the Menu Bar
Ever stared at a menu bar for inspiration? Fortunately for MacBook owners 
like you and me, people in Cupertino are paid to do just that, and these 
designers get the big bucks to make the Mac OS X menu bar the best that it 
can be. Thus were born menu bar icons, which add useful controls in what 
would otherwise be a wasted expanse of white.
Using menu bar icons
Depending on your hardware, Mac OS X might install several menu bar 
icons. The Volume icon is always there by default, along with the Clock dis-
play, which is actually an icon in disguise. Figure 3-8 illustrates these stan-
dard icons, along with a couple of others.
Some icons won’t appear unless you turn them on. For instance, the Displays 
icon won’t appear unless you enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check 
box within the Displays pane in System Preferences. The Displays menu bar 
icon, which looks like a monitor, allows you to choose the recommended 
resolutions and color depth settings for your graphics card and monitor. 
For example, the recommended settings for my MacBook Pro’s LCD monitor 
include 1024 x 768, 1280 x 800, and 1440 x 900 resolutions, and my display 
can be set to thousands or millions of colors. Typically, it’s a good idea to 
choose the highest resolution and the highest color depth. You can also 
jump directly to the System Preferences Display settings by clicking Displays 
Preferences in the menu.

106
Monkeying with the Menu Bar
 
Figure 3-8: 
Adjust your 
Mac with 
a click of 
these menu 
icons.
 
To quickly change the audio volume level within Mac OS X, click the Sound 
Volume icon (it looks like a speaker with emanating sound waves) once to 
display its slider control; then click and drag the slider to adjust the level 
up or down. After you select a level by lifting your finger from the trackpad, 
your MacBook thoughtfully plays the default system sound to help you 
gauge the new volume level.
Depending on the functionality that you’re using with Mac OS X, these other 
menu bar icons might also appear:
 
✦ Modem status: You can turn on the display of the Modem status icon 
from the corresponding modem panel on the Network pane in System 
Preferences, which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 3. The icon can be set 
to show the time that you’ve been connected to the Internet as well as 
the status of the connection procedure. (Naturally, your MacBook will 
need an external USB modem to use this status icon.)
 
✦ AirPort: Because your MacBook is equipped with AirPort Extreme 
hardware, you can enable the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check 
box within System Preferences. To do so, click the Network icon and 
then choose your AirPort connection in the column at the left. The 
AirPort status icon displays the status of the AirPort connection; click 
the AirPort icon to toggle AirPort on or off. The icon displays the rela-
tive strength of your AirPort signal, whether you’re connected to a 
Base Station or a peer-to-peer computer network, or whether AirPort is

turned off. You can also switch between multiple AirPort networks from 
the menu.
 
✦ Bluetooth: You can toggle Bluetooth networking on or off. You can 
also make your MacBook discoverable or hidden to other Bluetooth 
devices, send a file to a Bluetooth device, or browse for new Bluetooth 
devices in your vicinity. Additionally, you can set up a Bluetooth device 
that’s already recognized or open the Bluetooth pane within System 
Preferences.
 
✦ Time Machine: If you’re using Time Machine to back up your MacBook 
automatically, this icon displays the date of your last backup. You can 
also manually start a backup from the menu bar icon. To display the icon, 
open System Preferences and click the Time Machine icon; then click the 
Show Time Machine Status in the Menu Bar check box to select it.
 
✦ PPoE: The display of this icon is controlled from the PPoE settings on 
the Network pane within System Preferences. Click this icon to con-
nect to or disconnect from the Internet using Point-to-Point over Ethernet 
(PPoE), which is a type of Internet connection offered by some digital 
subscriber line (DSL) providers.
Doing timely things with the Clock
Even the Clock itself isn’t static eye candy on the Mac OS X menu bar (I told 
you this was a hardworking operating system, didn’t I?). Click the Clock dis-
play to toggle the icon between the default text display and a miniature analog 
clock. You’ll also find the complete day and date at the top of the menu.
“Where the heck did mounting come from, 
anyway? Sounds like a line from a John Wayne 
Western!” Well, pardner, the term dates back 
to the heyday of Big Iron — the Mainframe 
Age, when giant IBM dinosaurs populated 
the computing world. (And, coincidentally, I 
was a COBOL programmer.) Sherman, set the 
WayBack Machine. . . .
At the time, disks were big, heavy, removable 
cartridges the diameter of dinner plates (and 
about as tall as a 100-count spindle of CD-Rs). 
The acolytes of the mainframe, called com-
puter operators, would have to trudge over 
to a cabinet and swap disk cartridges when-
ever the program stopped and asked for them. 
That’s right, those mainframes would actually 
stop calculating and print, “I need you to mount 
cartridge 12-A-34, or I can’t go any further. 
Have a nice day.” (Can you imagine what it’d be 
like loading and unloading a hard drive every 
time you needed to open a folder?)
Anyway, even though eons passed and mini-
computers appeared — which were only the 
size of a washing machine — the terms mount-
ing and unmounting still commonly appeared 
in programs. This time, the removable volumes 
were 8-inch floppy disks and tape cartridges. 
Because UNIX (and its offspring Linux) date 
from the Minicomputer Age, these operating 
systems still use the terms.

Eject, Tex, Eject!
In fact, you can even open the System Preferences Date & Time settings from 
the icon. From within the Date & Time settings, you can choose whether the 
seconds or day of the week are included, whether the separators should 
flash, or whether Mac OS X should display the time in 24-hour (military) 
format. More on this in Book III, Chapter 3.
Eject, Tex, Eject!
Mac OS X makes use of both static volumes (your MacBook’s hard drive, 
which remains mummified inside your computer’s case) and removable 
volumes (such as USB Flash drives, your iPod, and CDs/DVD-ROMs). 
Mac OS X calls the process of loading and unloading a removable volume 
by old-fashioned terms — mounting and unmounting — but you and I call 
the procedure loading and ejecting.
 
Just to keep things clear, I should point out that we’re talking hardware 
devices here, so static and removable volumes have nothing to do with the 
sound volume control on your menu bar.
I won’t discuss loading/mounting a removable volume — the process differs 
depending on the computer because some MacBooks need a button pushed 
on the keyboard, others have buttons on the drive itself, and some drives 
have just a slot, with no button at all. However, there are a number of stan-
dard ways of unloading/unmounting/ejecting a removable volume:
 
✦ Drag the Volume’s icon from the Desktop to the Trash, which displays 
an Eject pop-up label to help underline the fact that you are not deleting 
the contents of the drive. Let me underline that with a Mark’s Maxim 
because Switchers from the Windows world are usually scared to death 
by the concept of dragging a volume to the Trash.
 
 Have no fear — in the Apple universe, you can drag removable vol-
umes to the Trash with aplomb.
 
✦ Click the Volume’s icon and use the Ô+E keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ With the volume open in a Finder window, click the Action button 
and choose Eject from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Click the File menu and choose Eject.
 
✦ Click the Eject button next to the device in the Finder window sidebar.
 
✦ Right-click the Volume’s icon to display the contextual menu; then 
choose Eject.
 
✦ Press your MacBook’s keyboard Eject key to eject a CD or DVD from 
your built-in optical drive. (If you’re using an external keyboard with-
out a Media Eject key, you may be able to press and hold F12 instead.)
You can’t unmount a static volume from the Desktop — you have to use the 
Disk Utility application — so your internal hard drive icon will stay where it is.

Common Tasks Aplenty
Common Tasks Aplenty
Okay, I admit it — this section is kind of a grab bag of three very common 
tasks. However, I want to walk you through these three procedures early in 
the book. Most MacBook owners want to listen to and record CDs as soon as 
they start using Snow Leopard, and you’d be amazed how much information 
still flows across the Internet in plain, simple text.
Therefore, hang around and take care of business.
Opening and editing text files
Text files would seem to be another anachronism in this age of formatted 
Web pages, rich-text format (RTF) documents, and word processors galore. 
However, virtually every computer ever built can read and write in standard 
text, so text files are often used for
 
✦ Information files on the Internet, such as FAQs (Frequently Asked 
Questions files)
 
✦ README and update information by software developers
 
✦ Swapping data between programs, such as comma- and tab-delimited 
database files
Here’s the quick skinny on opening, editing, and saving an existing text file:
 
1. Navigate to your Applications folder and launch TextEdit.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
3. Navigate to the desired text file and double-click the filename to 
load it.
 
 You can also open an existing text file by dragging its icon from the 
Finder window to the TextEdit icon.
 
4. Click the insertion cursor anywhere in the file and begin typing. Or, 
to edit existing text, drag the insertion cursor across the characters to 
highlight them and type the replacement text.
 
 TextEdit automatically replaces the existing characters with those that 
you type. To simply delete text, highlight the characters and press 
Delete.
 
5. After you finish editing the document, you can overwrite the original 
by pressing Ô+S (which is the same as choosing File➪Save), or you 
can save a new version by choosing File➪Save As and typing a new, 
unique filename.
 
6. To exit TextEdit, press Ô+Q.

Common Tasks Aplenty
Listening to an audio CD
By default, Snow Leopard uses iTunes to play an audio CD. Although I cover 
iTunes in complete detail in Book IV, Chapter 2, take a moment to see how 
to master the common task of playing an audio CD (just in case you want to 
jam while reading these early chapters). Follow these steps:
 
1. Load the audio CD into your MacBook’s optical drive. (Remember, 
MacBook Air owners, you can add an external USB optical drive at 
any time.)
 
 A CD volume icon appears on your Desktop, and then Mac OS X auto-
matically loads iTunes and displays its spiffy window.
 
2. If you have iTunes set up to start playing by default, it automatically 
begins playing the disc; however, if you have to manually start the 
music, click the Play button at the upper left of the iTunes window to 
begin playing the disc at the beginning. To play an individual track, 
double-click the track name in the iTunes window.
 
3. To adjust the volume from within iTunes, drag the Volume slider 
to the left or right — it’s to the right of the Play and Fast Forward 
buttons.
 
4. To eject the disc and load another audio CD, press Ô+E, click the Eject 
icon next to the CD entry in the Source list, or click Controls➪Eject Disc.
 
5. To exit iTunes, press Ô+Q.
 
The first time you run iTunes, you’re asked to configure the program and spec-
ify whether Mac OS X should automatically connect to the Internet to down-
load the track titles for the disc you’ve loaded. I recommend that you accept all 
the default settings and that you allow automatic connection. Is simple, no?
Need to install a font in Mac OS X, or perhaps 
you’d like to organize your fonts into collections 
based on their theme or their designer? If so, 
you’re talking about Font Book, which is the 
font organizer that ships with Snow Leopard. 
To open Font Book, visit your Applications 
folder and double-click the Font Book icon.
Press Ô+O (or choose File➪Add Fonts) to import 
a new font into your system, or simply drag the 
font file from a Finder window into the Font Book 
window. Snow Leopard can accept TrueType, 
OpenType, and PostScript Type 1 fonts. When 
it’s been added, your new font can be catego-
rized by dragging it into one of your collections, 
thus making that font easier to locate and dis-
play. Individual fonts and entire collections can 
be enabled or disabled (by using the Enable 
and Disable items on the Edit menu) so that you 
can “turn on” only those fonts that you need 
for a specific application or project. The Font 
Book window also comes fully equipped with a 
Search box, so you can find any font by name.

All You Really Need to Know about Printing
Recording — nay, burning — a data CD
Mac OS X offers a built-in CD recording feature that allows you to burn the 
simplest form of CD: a standard data CD-ROM that can hold up to approxi-
mately 660MB of files and folders, and can be read on both Macs and PCs 
running Windows, UNIX, and Linux. (To burn an audio CD, use iTunes, as I 
show you in Book IV, Chapter 2.)
Back to the story! To record a data disc, follow these steps:
 
1. Load a blank CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW into your drive.
 
 I assume for this demonstration that you’re using a write-once CD-R.
 
2. In the dialog that appears and prompts you for an action to take, 
choose the default, Open Finder, for this demonstration.
 
 Mac OS X displays an Untitled CD volume icon on your Desktop. (It’s 
marked with the letters CDR so that you know that the disc is recordable.)
 
3. Double-click the Untitled CD icon to display the contents. (It’ll be 
empty, naturally.)
 
4. Click and drag files and folders to the CD window as you normally do.
 
5. Rename any files or folders as necessary.
 
 Remember, after you’ve started recording, this stuff is etched in stone, 
so your disc window should look the same as the volume window looks 
on the finished CD-ROM.
 
6. Click File on the Finder menu and choose Burn Disc, or click the Burn 
button in the CD window.
 
 The Big X displays a confirmation dialog.
 
7. If you’ve forgotten something, you can click the Cancel or Eject button. 
Otherwise, click the Burn button and sit back and watch the fun.
 
Unfortunately, Mac OS X doesn’t support recording from the Finder for some 
external and third-party drives available for the Macintosh. If you can’t burn 
from the Finder (or you’re willing to pay for extra features), I recommend that 
you buy a copy of Roxio Toast Titanium recording software (www.roxio.com).
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
To close out this chapter, I turn your attention to another task that most 
MacBook owners need to tackle soon after buying their laptop or installing 
Snow Leopard: printing documents. Because basic printing is so important 
(and in most cases, so simple), allow me to use this final section to demon-
strate how to print a document.

112
All You Really Need to Know about Printing
Most of us have a Universal Serial Bus (USB) printer — USB being the 
favored hardware connection within Mac OS X — so, as long as your printer 
is supported by Mac OS X, setting it up is as easy as plugging it into one of 
your Mac’s USB ports. The Big X does the rest of the work, selecting the 
proper printer software driver from the Library/Printers folder and setting 
your printer as the default power of the universe.
 
Before you print, preview! Would you jump from an airplane without a para-
chute? Then why would you print a document without double-checking it 
first? Click Preview, and Mac OS X opens the Preview application to show you 
what the printed document will look like. (Once again, some upstart applica-
tions have their own built-in Print Preview mode thumbnails within the Print 
dialog, so previewing may not be necessary.) When you’re done examining 
your handiwork, close the Preview application to return to your document.
To print from within any application using the default page characteristics — 
standard 81⁄2-x-11-inch paper, portrait mode, no scaling — follow these steps:
 
1. Within your application, click File and choose Print — or press the 
Ô+P keyboard shortcut.
 
 Mac OS X displays the simple version of the Print dialog. (To display 
all the fields that you see in Figure 3-9, click the button with the down 
arrow next to the Printer pop-up menu.)

All You Really Need to Know about Printing
 
 Some applications use their own custom Print dialogs, but you should 
see the same general settings.
 
2. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies that you need.
 
 You can also enable or disable collation, just as you can with those oh-
so-fancy copiers.
 
3. Decide what you want to print.
 
• The whole shootin’ match: To print the entire document, use the 
default Pages radio button setting of All.
 
• Anything less: To print a range of selected pages, select the From 
radio button and enter the physical starting and ending pages.
 
4. (Optional) Choose application-specific printing parameters.
 
 Each Mac OS X application provides different panes so that you can 
configure settings specific to that application. You don’t have to display 
any of these extra settings to print a default document, but the power 
is there to change the look dramatically when necessary. To display 
these settings, click the pop-up menu in the center of the Print dialog 
and choose one of these panes. For example, if you’re printing from the 
Address Book, you can choose the Address Book entry from the pop-up 
menu and elect to print a phone list or an e-mail list.
 
5. When everything is go for launch, click the Print button.
Of course, there are more settings and more functionality to the printing 
system within Mac OS X, and I cover more complex printing topics in much 
more detail in Book VIII, Chapter 4. However, I can tell you from my experi-
ences as a consultant and hardware technician that this short introduction 
to printing will likely suffice for 90 percent of the MacBook owners on Earth. 
’Nuff said.

Chapter 4: Searching Everything 
with Spotlight
In This Chapter

✓ Selecting text and keywords for best results
✓ Displaying results in the Spotlight window
✓ Customizing Spotlight settings in System Preferences
S
potlight is Apple’s desktop search technology that you can use to find 
anything on your laptop as quickly as you can type. (Yep, that includes 
all the documents, Address Book contacts, Mail messages, folders, and 
drives that your MacBook can access.) In fact, the version of Spotlight 
included with Snow Leopard can even search folders shared on other Macs 
across your network! Yes, you read right: If the information is on your 
MacBook’s hard drive, a CD, your network, or even another Mac in your net-
work, consider it located.
This chapter is your ticket to using this new search technology like a profes-
sional techno-wizard from day one. I discuss how Spotlight works and how 
you can use it to locate exactly what you want (and present those results as 
proudly as a wine steward showing off a fine vintage).
Basic Searching 101
Figure 4-1 illustrates the Spotlight search field, which is always available 
from the Finder menu bar. Click the magnifying glass icon once (or press 
Ô+Spacebar), and the Spotlight search box appears.
To run a search, simply click in the Spotlight box and begin typing. You 
see matching items appear as soon as you type, and the search results are 
continually refined while you type the rest of your search criteria. As with 
the Search box in earlier Finder window toolbars, you don’t need to press 
Return to begin the search.

116
Basic Searching 101
 
Figure 4-1: 
A lot of 
power is 
behind 
this single 
Spotlight 
search box.
 
The results of your Spotlight search are presented in the Spotlight menu, 
which is updated automatically in real time while you continue to type. The 
top 20 most-relevant items are grouped into categories right on the Spotlight 
menu, including Messages, Definitions, Documents, Folders, Images, 
Contacts, and so on. Spotlight takes a guess at the item that’s most likely 
the match you’re looking for (based on your Search Results list in System 
Preferences, which I cover later in the chapter) and presents it in the special 
Top Hit category that always appears first.
 
To open the Top Hit item like a true Snow Leopard power user, just press 
Return. (My brothers and sisters, it just doesn’t get any easier than that.)
Literally any text string is acceptable as a Spotlight search. However, here’s 
a short list of the common search criteria I use every day:
 
✦ Names and addresses: Because Spotlight has access to Snow Leopard’s 
Address Book, you can immediately display contact information using 
any portion of a name or address.
 
✦ E-mail message text: Need to open a specific e-mail message, but you’d 
rather not launch Mail and spend time digging through the message list? 
Enter the person’s e-mail address or any text string contained in the 
message you’re looking for.
 
✦ File and folder names: This is the classic search favorite. Spotlight 
searches your entire system for that one file or folder in the blink of 
an eye.
 
✦ Events & To Do items: Yep, Spotlight gives you access to your iCal cal-
endars and those all-important To Do lists you’ve created.
 
✦ System Preferences: Now things start to get really interesting! Try 
typing the word background in the Spotlight field. Some of the results 
will actually be System Preference panes! That’s right, every setting 
in System Preferences is referenced in Spotlight. (For example, the 
Software Update pane contains the word background while the desktop 

Book II
Chapter 4
Searching 
Everything

117
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
background setting is on the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System 
Preferences.)
 
✦ Web pages: Whoa. Stand back, Google. You can use Spotlight to search 
the Web pages you’ve recently displayed in Safari! (Note, however, that 
this feature doesn’t let you search through all the Internet as Google 
does . . . only the pages stored in your Safari Web cache and any HTML 
files you’ve saved to your MacBook’s hard drive.)
 
✦ Metadata: That’s a pretty broad category, but it fits. For example, I like 
to locate Word documents on my system using the same metadata that’s 
stored in the file, such as the contents of the Comments field in a Word 
document. Other supported applications include Photoshop images, 
Excel spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and other third-party appli-
cations that offer a Spotlight plug-in.
To reset the Spotlight search and try another text string, click the X icon 
that appears at the right side of the Spotlight box. (Of course, you can also 
backspace to the beginning of the field, but that’s a little less elegant.)
After you find the item that you’re looking for, you can click it once to
 
✦ Launch it (if the item is an application)
 
✦ Open it in System Preferences (if it’s a setting or description on a 
Preferences pane)
 
✦ Open it within the associated application (if the item is a document or a 
data item)
 
✦ Display it within a Finder window (if the item is a folder)
 
Here’s another favorite timesaver: You can display all the files of a particular 
type on your system by using the file type as the keyword. For example, 
to provide a list of all images on your system, just use images as your 
keyword — the same goes for movies and audio, too.
In fact, you can display the same search results from the Snow Leopard 
Sidebar, which includes a Search For heading! You can display All Images, 
All Movies, and All Documents with a single click of your mouse button, from 
any Finder window.
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Don’t get fooled into simply using Spotlight as another file-’n-folder-name 
search tool. Sure, it can do that, but Spotlight can also search inside PDF, 

118
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Word, Pages and HTML files, finding matching text that doesn’t appear in the 
name of the file! To wit: A search for Snow Leopard on my system pulls up 
all sorts of items with Snow Leopard in their names, but also files with Snow 
Leopard in them:
 
✦ Apple Store SF.ppt: A PowerPoint presentation that contains several 
slides containing the text Snow Leopard
 
✦ bk01ch03.doc: A rather cryptically named Word file chapter of this book 
that mentions Snow Leopard in several spots
 
✦ Conference Call with Bob: An iCal event pointing to a conference call with 
my editor about upcoming Snow Leopard book projects
Notice that not one of these three examples actually has the words Snow 
Leopard occurring anywhere in the title or filename, yet Spotlight found 
them because they all contain the text Snow Leopard therein. That, dear 
reader, is the true power of Spotlight, and how it can literally guarantee you 
that you’ll never lose another piece of information in the hundreds of thou-
sands of files and folders on your hard drive!
Heck, suppose that all you remember about a file is that you received it in 
your mail last week or last month. To find it, you can actually type in time 
periods, such as yesterday, last week, or last month, to see every item that 
you saved or received within that period. (Boy, howdy, I love writing about 
truly good ideas.)
 
Again, the Sidebar also allows you to search for files by time period, using 
the links under the Search For heading.
So how about all those files, folders, contacts, 
and events that you don’t want to appear 
in Spotlight? What if you’re sharing your 
MacBook as a multiuser computer, or access-
ing other Macs remotely? Can others search 
for and access your personal information 
through Spotlight?
Definitely not! The results displayed by 
Spotlight are controlled by file and folder per-
missions as well as your account login, just as 
the applications that create and display your 
personal data are. For example, you can’t 
access other users’ calendars using iCal, 
and they can’t see your Mail messages. Only 
you have access to your data, and only after 
you’ve logged in with your username and pass-
word. Spotlight works the same way. If a user 
doesn’t normally have access to an item, the 
item simply doesn’t appear when that user per-
forms a Spotlight search. (In other words, only 
you get to see your stuff.)
However, you can even hide certain folders 
and disks from your own Spotlight searches if 
necessary. Check out the final section of this 
chapter for details on setting private locations 
on your system.
Is Spotlight secure?

Book II
Chapter 4
Searching

119
Is Spotlight Really That Cool?
Be careful, however, when you’re considering a search string. Don’t forget 
that (by default) Spotlight matches only those items that have all the words 
you enter in the Spotlight box. To return the highest number of possible 
matches, use the fewest number of words to identify the item; for example, 
use horse rather than horse image, and you’re certain to be rewarded with 
more hits. (On the other hand, if you’re looking specifically for a picture of a 
knight on horseback, a series of keywords, such as horse knight image, short-
ens your search considerably. It all depends on what you’re looking for and 
how widely you want to cast your Spotlight net.)
To allow greater flexibility in searches, Apple also includes those helpful 
Boolean friends that you may already be familiar with: AND, OR, and NOT. For 
example, you can perform Spotlight searches, such as
 
✦ Horse AND cow (which collects all references to both those barnyard ani-
mals into one search)
 
✦ Batman OR Robin (which returns all references to either Batman or 
Robin, but not both)
 
✦ Apple NOT PC (which displays all references to Apple that don’t include 
any information on dastardly PCs)
 
Because Spotlight functions are a core technology of Mac OS X Snow 
Leopard — in other words, all sorts of applications can make use of Spotlight 
throughout the operating system, including the Finder — the Finder win-
dow’s Search box now shares many of the capabilities of Spotlight. In fact, 
you can use the time period trick that I mention earlier (entering yesterday 
as a keyword) in the Finder window Search box.
 
Okay, parents, listen closely: Here’s a (somewhat sneaky) tip that might help 
you monitor your kid’s computer time as well as what your kids are typing/
reading in iChat:
 
1. Enable the iChat transcript feature.
 
a. From within iChat, choose iChat➪Preferences.
 
b. Click Messages.
 
c. Select the Save Chat Transcripts To check box and choose a destination 
folder in a location you can access.
 
2. Click OK to return to iChat.
 
 Now you can use Spotlight to search for questionable words, phrases, 
and names within those iChat transcripts. (For more on iChat, turn to 
Book VI, Chapter 3.)

Expanding Your Search Horizons
Expanding Your Search Horizons
I can just hear the announcer’s voice now: “But wait, there’s more! If you 
click the Show All menu item at the beginning of your search results, 
we’ll expand your Spotlight menu into the Spotlight Results window!” 
(Fortunately, you don’t have to buy some ridiculous household doodad.)
 
Keyboard mavens will appreciate the Spotlight window shortcut key, and I 
show you where to specify this shortcut in the final section of this chapter.
Figure 4-2 illustrates the Results window (which is actually a Finder window 
with extras). To further filter the search, click one of the buttons on the 
Spotlight Results window toolbar or create your own custom filter. Click the 
button with the plus sign to display the search criteria bar and then click 
the pop-up menus to choose from criteria, such as the type of file, the text 
content, or the location on your system (for example, your hard drive, your 
Home folder, or a network server). You can also filter your results listing by 
the date the items were created or last saved. To add or delete criteria, click 
the plus and minus buttons at the right side of the search criteria bar. To 
save a custom filter that you’ve created, click the Save button.

Images appear as thumbnail icons, so you can use that most sophisticated 
search tool — the human eye — to find the picture you’re looking for. (If you 
don’t see thumbnail images, click the Icon view button on the toolbar.) Don’t 
forget that you can increase or decrease the size of the icons by dragging the 
slider at the bottom right of the window.

To display the contents item in the list (without leaving the comfortable con-
fines of the Results window), click. the icon to select it and click the Quick 
Look icon in the toolbar (or press the spacebar) for a better view.
Again, when you’re ready to open an item, just double-click it in the Results 
window.
As I mention earlier, Spotlight can look for matching items on other Macs 
on your network — but only if those remote Macs are configured correctly. 
To allow another Mac running Mac OS X Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard to 
be visible to Spotlight on your system, enable File Sharing on the other Mac. 
(Oh, and remember that you need an admin-level account on that Mac — or 
access to a good friend who has an admin-level account on that Mac.)
Follow these steps to enable File Sharing on the other Mac:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing pane.
 
3. Select the On check box next to the File Sharing item in the service 
list to enable it.
 
4. Click the Close button on the System Preferences window.
Remember, you can search only items that you have rights and permissions 
to view on the remote Mac (such as the contents of the Public folders on 
that computer). I discuss more about these limitations earlier in this chap-
ter, in the “Is Spotlight secure?” sidebar.
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
You might wonder whether such an awesome Mac OS X feature has its 
own pane within System Preferences — and you’d be right again. Figure 4-3 
shows off the Spotlight pane within System Preferences: Click the System 
Preferences icon (look for the gears) in the Dock and then click the Spotlight 
icon (under Personal) to display these settings.
Click the Search Results tab to
 
✦ Determine which categories appear in the Spotlight menu and Results 
window. For example, if you don’t use any presentation software on 
your MacBook, you can clear the check box next to Presentations to 
disable this category (thereby making more room for other categories 
that you will use).

122
Customizing Spotlight to Your Taste
 
✦ Determine the order that categories appear in the Spotlight menu and 
Results window. Drag the categories to the order in which you want 
them to appear in the Spotlight menu and window. For example, I like 
the Documents and System Preferences categories to appear higher in 
the list because I use them most often.
 
✦ Specify the Spotlight menu and Spotlight Results window keyboard 
shortcuts. You can enable or disable either keyboard shortcut and 
choose the key combination from the pop-up menu.

Click the Privacy tab (as shown in Figure 4-4) to specify disks and folders 
that should never be listed as results in a Spotlight search. I know, I know, 
I said earlier that Spotlight respected your security, and it does. However, 
the disks and folders that you add on this list won’t appear even if you 
are the one performing the search. (This is a great idea for folders and 
removable hard drives that you use to store sensitive information, such as 
medical records.)
To add locations that you want to keep private, click the Add button (bear-
ing a plus sign) and navigate to the desired location. Click the location to 
select it and then click Choose. (Alternatively, you can drag folders or disks 
directly from a Finder window and drop them into the pane.)

✓ Working with the Apple Remote
✓ Using Front Row
M
any Apple switchers and first-time owners quickly notice the unusual 
feature that accompanies the latest MacBooks: a tiny square lens 
and LED light at the top of the laptop’s screen. That square is the lens of 
your MacBook’s built-in iSight camera, which allows video chatting in iChat 
or a quick, fun series of photos or video clips via Snow Leopard’s Photo 
Booth and iMovie applications. (Some third-party applications can use 
your MacBook’s camera for things like reading bar codes.) Heck, you can 
even take your user account photo with your iSight camera (in the System 
Preferences window)!
Ah, but there’s more. You can also buy an Apple Remote, which appears to 
be a stick of chewing gum with buttons (or an old-style iPod Shuffle). You 
can use an Apple Remote to control your MacBook from the comfort of your 
lounge chair or breakfast nook via Snow Leopard’s Front Row software (as 
well as other third-party applications with Apple Remote support). What’s 
that you say? Your last computer didn’t have a remote control? You’ve 
never used a computer video camera? Well then, good reader, you’ve come 
to the right place!
In this chapter, I show you how to use your MacBook’s remote to dazzle 
your friends and family with all sorts of digital media; then, I demonstrate 
how easy it is to produce photos and video with your iSight camera. Sassy!

ranks of the iChat elite in Book VI, Chapter 3. Photo Booth allows you to 
snap digital pictures just as you did in the old automatic photo booth at 
your local arcade, but Photo Book comes complete with visual effects to add 
pizzazz and punch to your photos.

The iSight camera’s indicator light glows green whenever you’re taking a 
snapshot or recording video . . . which, when you think about it, is A Good 
Thing (especially if you prefer chatting at home in Leisure Mode).
 
Need to quickly get a picture of yourself for use on your Web page? Or per-
haps your iChat icon needs an update to show off your new haircut. Photo 
Booth can capture images at 640 x 480 resolution and 32-bit color — and 
although today’s digital cameras produce a much higher-quality photo, you 
can’t beat the built-in convenience of Photo Booth for that quick snapshot! 
To snap an image in Photo Booth, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Photo Booth from the Applications folder.
 
 Figure 5-2 illustrates the application window that appears. (Ignore the 
rather silly gentleman who wandered into the frame. I doubt he’ll be in 
your Photo Booth window!)

2. (Optional) Click the Effects button to choose an effect you’d like to 
apply to your image.
 
 Photo Booth displays a screen of thumbnail preview images so that you 
can see how each effect changes the photo. You can produce some of 
the simple effects you may be familiar with from Photoshop, such as a 
black-and-white image or a fancy color-pencil filter, but Photo Booth can 
also deliver some mind-blowing distortion effects, and even an Andy 
Warhol–style pop-art image!
 
 To return the display to normal without choosing an effect, click the 
Normal thumbnail, which appears in the center. (Paul Lynde’s spot, for 
those of you old enough to remember “Hollywood Squares.”)
 
 Of course, you can always launch your favorite image editor afterward 
to use a filter or effect on a photo — for example, the effects available 
in iPhoto. Photo Booth can apply these effects automatically as soon as 
you take the picture.

 When you choose an effect, Photo Booth automatically closes the Effects 
display.
 
4. Click the Camera button.
You’ll notice that the image appears in the filmstrip at the bottom of the 
window. Photo Booth keeps a copy of all the images you take in the filmstrip 
so that you can use them later. After you click a photo in the filmstrip, a 
series of buttons appears, including
 
✦ Sending the photo in an e-mail message
 
✦ Saving the photo directly to iPhoto
 
✦ Using the image as your Snow Leopard user account icon
 
✦ Using the image as your iChat Buddy icon
 
To delete an image from the Photo Booth filmstrip, click the offending photo 
and then click the X button that appears underneath.
Producing Video on the Spot with iMovie
“Mark, am I limited to capturing still images with my MacBook’s camera?” 
Oh, pshaw on limitations . . . you’re a MacBook owner, after all! You can also 
use your iSight camera to snag video clips (complete with audio) in iMovie.
 
You don’t need an expensive digital camcorder to produce video clips for 
use in iMovie! Your MacBook’s camera can capture those clips for you — 
think of the party possibilities! (And the opportunity for practical jokes. But 
then again, you’re not that kind of person, now are you?) To capture video 
directly from your iSight camera into iMovie, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch iMovie from the Dock or from the Applications folder.
 
2. Click the Open Camera Import Window button to switch to Import 
Video mode.
 
 The button is located at the far left of the toolbar running down the 
center of the iMovie window, and it sports a camera icon.
 
3. Click the Camera pop-up menu at the bottom of the Import window 
and click Built-in iSight.
 
4. When you’re ready to start recording video, click the Capture button.
 
 iMovie displays a sheet allowing you to select the location for the movie 
clip (including the approximate amount of time you can record). You

can also choose to add the video to an existing iMovie Event or a brand-
new Event. To help keep things steady in your clip, click the Analyze 
for Stabilization after Import check box to enable it — but note that the 
stabilization process significantly adds to the time it takes for iMovie to 
save your clip to disk. (Also, the stabilization data that’s created during 
this step isn’t actually applied to the video until the clip is added to a 
project, so your clip may still look shaky in the Event browser.)
 
5. When you’re ready to start recording video, click the Capture button.
 
 iMovie automatically displays the incoming video in the monitor window 
while it’s recorded. (As you might expect, the goofy behavior on the part 
of the distinguished cast usually starts at about this moment.)
 
6. Click the Stop button to stop recording.
 
 After you’ve ended the recording, iMovie creates the video clip and adds 
it to your Clips pane.
I go into much more detail on iMovie in Chapter 4 of Book IV, but that’s the 
gist of recording video clips.
Controlling Your MacBook Remotely with Front Row
Okay, you’ve seen some neat stuff so far, but things get really cool about now! 
With Apple’s Front Row software, you can turn your MacBook into a multime-
dia presentation center that can show off all your digital media to your ador-
ing public (and friends and family to boot). In fact, with the Apple Remote, you 
don’t even have to leave the comfort of the couch to start the show.
The Front Row application performs four different functions:
 
✦ Watching DVD movies with DVD Player: If you already loaded a DVD 
into your optical drive, you can watch it. (Sorry, your MacBook doesn’t 
load the DVD for you. I guess some things have to remain manually 
driven for a few years yet.)
 
✦ Viewing photos and slideshows: Front Row calls upon iPhoto so that 
you can see your albums, film rolls, and slideshows.
 
✦ Displaying TV shows, movies, videos, and movie trailers: You can 
choose most types of video you download from the iTunes Music Store 
or save to your Movies folder. If your laptop has a high-speed broad-
band connection to the Internet, you can also watch movie trailers 
straight from the Apple Web site.
 
✦ Coaxing your favorite music and podcasts from your iTunes library: 
Find your songs and playlists available from Front Row.

with the Address Book
In This Chapter

✓ Using contact information throughout Mac OS X
✓ Creating and e-mailing groups
✓ Printing contacts
✓ Importing and exporting vCards
D
o you have a well-thumbed address book stuck in a drawer of your 
office desk? Or do you have a wallet or purse stuffed with sticky 
notes and odd scraps of paper, each of which bears an invaluable e-mail 
address or phone number? If so, you can finally set yourself free and enjoy 
the “Paperless Lifestyle” of the new millennium with the revolutionary new 
Rauncho Digital Address Book! As seen on TV! Only $29.95 — and it doubles 
as an indestructible garden hose! But wait! If you order now, we’ll also 
send you . . . .
Of course, you and I would tune that stuff out as soon as we heard, “As seen 
on TV” — but, believe it or not, the Rauncho Digital Address Book does exist 
(after a fashion), and you already have one on your MacBook. It’s called 
the Address Book, and in this chapter, I show you how to store and retrieve 
all your contact data, including iChat information, photographs, and much 
more.
(And before you ask, operators are not standing by.)
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
It’s true that in early versions of Mac OS X, Address Book was relegated to 
the minor leagues and usually appeared only when you asked for it within 
Mail. Although it could be run as a separate application, there was no 
convenient route to the Address Book from the Desktop, so most Mac 
owners never launched it as a standalone.

134
Hey, Isn’t the Address Book Just a Part of Mail?
Now, however, the Address Book appears in the limelight, earning a default 
location in the Dock and available whenever you need it. Although the 
Address Book can still walk through a meadow hand-in-hand with Mail, it 
also flirts with other Mac OS X applications and can even handle some basic 
telephony chores all by itself through the use of Services.
Figure 6-1 illustrates the default face of the Address Book, complete with 
a personal address card: your own contact information, which you enter 
within the Setup Assistant that I mention in Book II, Chapter 1. This card 
carries a special me tag on your thumbnail image (indicating that it’s your 
personal card) as well as a suave-looking silhouette next to your name in 
the Name column. Other Mac OS X applications use the data in your card to 
automatically fill out your personal information in all sorts of documents. 
(In Figure 6-1, I added a number of well-known friends as well . . . a few TV 
characters, a composer or two. You know the drill.)

Note that when you move your mouse cursor over the Group and Name

when you click and drag the divider, you can resize the Group and Name 
columns as well as the display pane on the right. Plus, you can click the two 
buttons at the upper-left corner (underneath the window controls) to hide 
or show the Group and Name columns.

Entering Contact Information
Entering Contact Information
Unless you actually meet and hire a group of DataElves — see the sidebar, 
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?” — you have to add contacts to your 
Address Book manually. Allow me to demonstrate here how to create a new 
contact within your Address Book:
 
1. Launch Address Book from the Dock by clicking its icon.
 
 The icon looks like an old-fashioned paper Address Book with an @ 
symbol on the cover.
 
2. Press the Ô+N shortcut to create a new contact. Alternatively, choose 
File➪New Card or click the Add a New Person button at the bottom of 
the Name column.
 
 Address Book displays the template that you see in Figure 6-2, with the 
First name field highlighted and ready for you to type.
 
3. Enter the contact’s first name and press Tab to move to the Last name 
field.
 
4. Continue entering the corresponding information in each field, 
pressing Tab to move through the fields.
 
 If a field isn’t applicable (for example, if a person has no home page), 
just press Tab again to skip it. You can press Return to add extra lines to 
the Address field.

don’t know

Click to add a new person

136
Entering Contact Information
 
 When you complete certain fields — such as the Address field — a green 
plus sign pops up to the left of the field. That’s the Address Book telling 
you that there are additional versions of the field that you can enter as 
well. (Think home and work addresses.) Click this plus sign, and you 
can enter the other version. For example, if you enter an iChat address 
for the contact at home, the plus sign appears; click it and then you can 
enter the contact’s work iChat address, too.
 
 You can also add new fields to a card, such as Web addresses, birth-
days, maiden names, and the like. To add a new field, click Card➪Add 
Field and choose the field you want to add from the menu that appears.
 
5. To add a photograph to the card, click Card➪Choose Custom Image 
(or drag an image from a Finder window on top of the thumbnail 
square).
 
 Address Book displays a sheet that you can use to select the image. 
Click Choose to display our old friend the Open dialog.
 
 Click the Capture a picture from a video camera button (which bears a 
snazzy camera icon) to use your MacBook’s built-in iSight camera for a 
quick snapshot.
 
6. When you’re done, click the Edit button (bottom center) to save the 
card.
You can edit the contents of a card at any time by displaying it and clicking 
the Edit button at the bottom (or by pressing Ô+L, or even by clicking Edit 
and choosing the Edit Card menu item).
 
No need to edit a card to add information to the Note field — just click and 
type.
You can also add contact cards directly to your Address Book from the 
Mac OS X Mail application — go figure. Within Mail, click the message (to 
highlight it) from the person whom you want to add, click the friendly 
Message menu, and then click Add Sender to Address Book, or press Ô+Y. 
Naturally, adding people this way doesn’t add their supporting information — 
just their name and e-mail address (and, if they used Mail on their end to 
send the message and they have a photo attached to their personal card, 
their photo gets imported as well). Once again, your nimble fingers have to 
manually enter the rest. For more on Mail, see Book VI, Chapter 2.
 
Don’t forget to add those fax numbers! If you have an external analog 
modem, Snow Leopard can fax from any application — just click File and 
choose Print (or press Ô+P) as you always have, and then click the PDF 
button at the bottom of the Print dialog and choose Fax PDF. Mac OS X 
automatically fills in the address for you, but only if the contact has a fax 
number entered as part of the contact card.

Using Contact Information
If someone sends you a vCard (look for an attachment with a .vcf extension), 
consider yourself lucky. Just drag the vCard from the attachment window 
in Mail and drop it in your Address Book; any information that the person 
wants you to have is added automatically!
To delete a card, click the unlucky name to display the card, click Edit, and 
then choose Delete Card. Alternatively, press Delete and then Return to 
confirm the deletion.
Using Contact Information
Okay, after you have your contact information in Address Book, what can 
you actually do with it? Often, all you really need is a quick glance at an 
address. To display the card for any contact within Address Book, just 
click the desired entry in the Name column. You can move to the next and 
previous cards by using the up- and down-arrow keys on your keyboard. 
In my two-and-a-half decades of travel 
through the personal computing world, I’ve 
noticed one lovely recurring fantasy shared by 
computer users that keeps cropping up over and 
over: I call it the DataElf Phenomenon. You see, 
DataElves are the hard-working, silicon-based 
gnomes in tiny green suspenders who 
magically enter all the information that you 
want to track into your database (or Address 
Book, or Quicken, or whatever). They burrow 
into your papers and presto! — out pops all 
that data, neatly typed and . . . whoa, Nellie! 
Let’s stop there.
For some reason, computer users seem to 
forget that there are no DataElves. I wish I had 
a dime for every time I’ve heard a heartbroken 
computer user say, “You mean I have to type all 
that stuff in?” (My usual retort is, “Affirmative . . . 
unless you want to pay me a hideous amount 
to do it for you.”) Make no mistake — adding 
a lifetime’s worth of contact information into 
your Address Book can be several hours of 
monotonous and mind-bendingly boring work, 
which is another reason that many computer 
owners still depend on paper to store all those 
addresses. But take my word for it, dear reader, 
your effort is worth it — the next time that you 
sit down to prepare a batch of Christmas cards 
or you have to find Uncle Milton’s telephone 
number in a hurry, you will appreciate the effort 
that you made to enter contact information into 
your Address Book. (Just make sure that you 
— say it with me — back up your hard drive.)
By the way, if you’ve already entered 
contact information into another PIM (short 
for Personal Information Manager), you can 
reuse that data without retyping everything — 
that is, as long as your old program can export 
contacts in vCard format. After you export the 
records, just drag the vCards into the Address 
Book window to add them, or import them 
by pressing Ô+I. (More on this at the end of 
this chapter.) Address Book can also import 
old-fashioned tab-delimited text.
“I gotta type (or retype) that stuff?”

138
Using Contact Information
(Oh, and don’t forget that you can right-click many items within a card to 
display menu commands specific to those items.)
But wait, there’s more! You can also
 
✦ Copy and paste. The old favorites are still around. You can copy any 
data from a card (press Ô+C) and paste it into another open application 
(press Ô+V).
 
✦ Visit a contact’s home page. Click the contact entry to select it, and 
click the page link displayed within the card. Safari dutifully answers 
the call, and next thing you know, you’re online and at the home page 
specified in the entry.
 
✦ Send an e-mail message. If you’ve already read through Chapter 3 of 
this minibook, you’ll remember the Mac OS X Services feature that I tell 
you about. Click and drag to select any e-mail address on a card; then 
click the Address Book menu, click the Services menu, and choose Send 
To. Bingo! Depending on the information that you select, other services 
might also be available.
 
✦ Add an iChat buddy. From within iChat, click the Buddies menu and 
then click Add a Buddy. From the dialog that appears, you can select a 
contact card that has an Instant Messenger address and add it to your 
Buddy List.
 
✦ Export contacts. From within the Address Book, select the contacts that 
you want to export, click File, and then choose Export vCards from the 
Export submenu. Address Book displays a Save sheet. Navigate to the 
location where you want to save the cards and click Save.
 
✦ Search amongst your contacts. If you’re searching for a specific person 
and all you have is a phone number or a fragment of an address, click in 
the Search field at the top right of the Address Book window and type 
the text. While you continue to enter characters, Address Book shows 
you how many contacts contain matching characters and displays just 
those entries in the Name column. Now that’s sassy! (And convenient. 
And fast as all get-out.) Check out Figure 6-3, where many of the characters 
from my favorite TV show are gathered — note that a number of very 
familiar folks share the same address in Gotham City, and I found them 
by using the Search field.
 
Speaking of searching using a contact in the Address Book, Spotlight is also 
at your beck and call — click a contact to select it, then click the Edit menu 
and choose Spotlight. Whoosh! Snow Leopard searches your entire system 
for everything related to that contact and displays it in the familiar Spotlight 
window.

Arranging Your Contact Cards

Arranging Your Contact Cards
Address Book also provides you with a method of organizing your cards into 
groups. A group usually consists of folks with a common link, such as your 
family, friends, co-workers, and others who enjoy yodeling. For example, you 
could set up a Cell Phone group that you can use when syncing data with 
your Bluetooth cell phone.
To create a group, choose File➪New Group or press Ô+Shift+N. (Using the 
Hollywood method, click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Group 
column.) Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column, with a 
highlighted text box so that you can type the group name. After you type the 
group name, press Return to save it, and then click and drag the entries that 
you want to add to the New Group icon.
 
If you already selected the entries for those contacts that you want to add to 
the group, choose File➪New Group from Selection instead. This saves you a 
step because the group is created and the members are added automatically.
After you create a New Group, you can instantly display members of that 
group by clicking its icon in the Group column. To return to the display of all 
your contacts, click the All Groups button.

140
Using Network Directories
 
To further organize your groups, you can drag and drop a group on top of 
another group. It becomes a subgroup, which is handy for things like branch 
offices within your company or perhaps relatives to whom you’re not 
speaking at the moment.
Need an even harder-working group? Create a Smart Group, which — get 
this — automatically adds new contacts you create to the proper group, 
depending on the criteria you specify! To create a Smart Group, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Click File and click New Smart Group.
 
2. Type a name for the new Smart Group.
 
3. Click the Card pop-up menu and choose the item that will trigger the 
action.
 
 For example, you can choose to automate a Smart Group according to 
the contents of each new card, a company name, or a particular city or 
state.
 
4. Click the Contains pop-up menu and choose the criteria for the item.
 
 An item might contain (or not contain) a specific string of characters, or 
it might have changed in a certain amount of time. To illustrate, one of 
my hardest-working Smart Groups automatically checks the Company 
field in every new card for my publisher’s company name and adds that 
contact card to my Wiley Publishing group if a match occurs.
 
5. To add another criteria line, click the button with the plus sign at the 
end of the first text field.
 
 If you decide you have one criteria line too many, click the button with 
the minus sign next to the offending rule.
 
6. After your Smart Group criteria are correct, click OK.
 
 The Smart Group name appears in your group list, complete with a gear 
icon to indicate its intelligent status. Voilà!
 
Here’s another handy feature of an Address Book group: You can send all 
the members of a group the same e-mail message at one time. Within Mail, 
simply enter the Group name in the To field in the Compose window, and the 
same message is sent to everyone. Even Gandalf couldn’t do that (but my 
copy editor bets that Dumbledore could).
Using Network Directories
I know, I know, I said earlier that you’d have to enter all your contacts 
yourself — but I was talking about your personal contacts! You can also 
access three types of external directories from within Address Book:

Book II
Chapter 6
Keeping Track with 
the Address Book 
141
Using Network Directories
 
✦ Mac users working in a Windows network environment can use 
Exchange 2007 network directories.
 
✦ If you’re a member of a company NetInfo network — and if you don’t 
know, ask your wizened network administrator — you can search 
network directory servers from within Address Book. These servers are 
available automatically, so no configuration is necessary. Sweet.
 
✦ You can search Internet-based LDAP directories. Sorry, folks, I know 
that’s pretty cryptic, but others have written entire books on this 
technology. Again, suffice it to say that your network guru can tell you 
whether LDAP servers are available to you. (In another blazing display 
of techno-nerd acronym addiction, LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol.) With LDAP, you can search a central company directory 
from anywhere in the world as long as you have an Internet connection. 
To configure this feature, click Address Book from the menu and choose 
Preferences; click the LDAP tab and then click the + (plus sign) button to 
enter the specific settings for the server that you want to access. Your 
network administrator or the LDAP server administrator can supply you 
with these settings.
To search any network directory, you need to create a corresponding 
directory account. Follow these steps to add a directory account:
 
1. Click Address Book➪Preferences to display the Preferences window.
 
2. Click the Add button to launch the Add Account assistant.
 
3. Click the Account Type pop-up menu to choose the desired species of 
network directory.
 
 Type the required information in the fields that appear. (Your network 
administrator should be able to provide you with the necessary values.)
 
4. Click Create.
 
 You’ll see the blue network directory entry appear in the Group column.
The rest is easy! Click the Directories entry in the Group column and use the 
Search field as you normally would. Matching entries display the person’s 
name, e-mail address, and phone number.
 
“But hey, Mark, what if I’m not online? My company’s LDAP directory isn’t 
much good then, right?” Normally, that’s true. If you’re a mobile user, LDAP 
information is available to you only when you’re online and the LDAP server 
is available. Ah, but here’s a rocking power user tip that’ll do the trick for 
MacBook owners: To make a person’s information always available, search 
the LDAP database and drag the resulting entry from the Directories window 
to the All group. You’ll import the information to your local Address Book — 
and you’ll see it even when you’re not online!

Printing Contacts with Flair
Printing Contacts with Flair
Consider how to print your contacts (for those moments when you need an 
archaic hard copy). Address Book offers two different formats.
 
By default, Address Book prints on standard U.S. letter-size paper (81⁄2 x 11 
inches) in portrait orientation. You can change these settings right from the 
Print dialog: Choose File and click Print or press Ô+P. From the Print dialog, 
you can choose exotic settings, such as legal-size paper or landscape 
orientation.
Follow these steps to print your contacts:
 
1. Press Ô+P.
 
 Address Book displays the Print dialog. To show all the settings, click 
the Expand button next to the Printer field, which carries a downward-
pointing triangle.
 
 If you need more than one copy, click in the Copies field to specify the 
desired number.
 
 Need labels? We’ve got ’em! Click the Style pop-up menu and choose 
Mailing Labels to specify what type of label stock you’re using on the 
Layout panel. Click the Label button to sort your labels by name or 
postal code, choose a font, select a text color, and add an icon or image 
to your labels. To switch back to a standard contact list, click Style again 
and then click Lists. (You can also print envelopes and pocket address 
book pages in a similar manner — just choose the desired entry from 
the Style pop-up menu.)
 
2. Select the desired Attributes check boxes to specify which contact 
card fields you want to appear in your list.
 
 The Attributes list appears only if you’re printing contacts in Lists style.
 
3. Click the Print button to send the job to the selected printer.
 
 Alternatively, you can create a PDF file in a specified location — a handy 
trick to use if you’d rather not be burdened with paper, but you still 
need to consult the list or give it to others. (PDF files are a special 
document display format developed by Adobe; they display like a 
printed document but take up minimal space.) To display the contents 
of a PDF file in Mac OS X, you need only double-click it in the Finder 
window, and the built-in Preview application is happy to oblige.

Swapping Bytes with vCards
Swapping Bytes with vCards
A vCard is a standard file format for exchanging contacts between programs 
such as Address Book, Microsoft Entourage, Eudora, and the Palm computer 
desktop. (Heck, if you’re lucky enough to have an iPod or iPhone, you 
can even store vCard data there.) Think of a vCard as an electronic 
business card that you can attach to an e-mail message, send via File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP), or exchange with others by using your cellular 
phone and palmtop computer. vCard files end with the extension .vcf.
In Address Book, you can create a single vCard containing one or more 
selected entries by choosing File➪Export and choosing Export vCard. Then, 
as with any other Mac OS X Save dialog, just navigate to the spot where you 
want the file saved, give it a name, and click Save.
To import vCards into Address Book
 
✦ Drag the vCard files that you’ve received to Address Book and drop 
them in the application window.
 
✦ Alternatively, choose File➪Import (or press Ô+O). From the Open 
dialog, navigate to the location of the vCard files that you want to add, 
select them, and then click Open.

of Maintenance
In This Chapter
✓ Deleting applications
✓ Using Apple System Profiler
✓ Using Activity Monitor and Disk Utility
✓ Updating Mac OS X and your drivers
✓ Backing up your system
✓ Using a disk defragmenter and start-up keys
T
he title of this chapter really sounds like a contradiction in terms, 
doesn’t it? The concepts of joy and maintenance are likely mutually 
exclusive to you — and it’s true that most MacBook owners would rather 
work or play than spend time under the hood, getting all grimy. I understand 
completely; maintenance is far less sexy than a game like Sims 3 or even an 
exciting productivity application like Pages.
However, if you do want to work or play uninterrupted by lockups and 
crashes — yes, believe it or not, the Big X can indeed take a dive if it’s not 
cared for — and you’d like your MacBook to perform like Lance Armstrong, 
you have to get your hands dirty. That means performing regular maintenance 
on your hardware, Mac OS X, and your all-important applications, documents, 
and folders.
As do most techno-types, I actually enjoy pushing my system to the limit 
and keeping it running in top form. And who knows — after you become a 
Snow Leopard power user, you could find yourself bitten by the maintenance 
bug as well. In this chapter, I cover how to take care of necessary tune-up 
chores, step by step.
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
Nothing lasts forever, and that includes your applications. You might no 
longer need an application, or maybe you need to remove it to upgrade to a 
new version or to reinstall it. In contrast to Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X 
doesn’t have an Add or Remove Programs utility for uninstalling software — 
nor does it need one, because virtually all Macintosh applications are 

146
Deleting Applications the Common Sense Way
self-contained in a single folder or series of nested folders. (And not by 
accident . . . keeping everything related to an application within a single 
folder has always been a rule for Apple software developers since the first 
days of the Macintosh.) Therefore, removing an application is usually as 
easy as deleting the contents of the installation folder from your hard drive 
(for example, removing the Quicken folder to uninstall Quicken).
 
Always check the application’s README file and documentation for any 
special instructions before you delete any application’s folder! If you’ve 
created any documents in that folder that you want to keep, don’t forget to 
move them before you trash the folder and its contents. In fact, some 
applications may come complete with their own uninstall utility, so checking 
the README and documentation may save you unnecessary steps.
 
Some applications can leave preference files, start-up applications, or driver 
files in other spots on your disk besides their home folder. When you’re 
uninstalling a program that has support files in other areas, use the Search 
box in the Finder toolbar to locate other files that might have been created 
by the application. (I cover this feature in Book II, Chapter 1.) Again, don’t 
forget to check whether an application has an uninstall utility (or an 
uninstall option available through the original setup application).
For example, Figure 7-1 illustrates a Spotlight search that I’ve run on 
Microsoft Office 2008. By searching for the word office, I found a number 
of files created in other folders, such as the Settings file that’s in my 
Preferences folder. Typically, you want to delete the main application folder 
and then remove these orphans.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Use 
Spotlight 
to locate 
support 
files after 
uninstalling 
an 
application.
 
Spring Cleaning, from Smith Micro ($50; my.smithmicro.com), also has the 
ability to uninstall a program, as well as a feature that can find and remove 
orphaned files left from past applications.

Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
Popping the Hood: Using the System Profiler
Need hard information about your hardware? You might need to determine 
precisely what hardware is installed in your MacBook for the following 
reasons:
 
✦ If you’re working with a technical support person to solve a problem: 
This person will usually request information about your system, such as 
what processor you’re running and how much memory you have.
 
✦ If you’re evaluating an application before you buy it: You’ll want to 
check its minimum system requirements against the hardware on your 
laptop.
 
✦ If you’re considering an upgrade to your MacBook: You’ll likely need 
to determine how much memory you have, what type it is, and which 
memory slots are filled. (The same goes for your hard drive.) For more 
on upgrading your MacBook, thumb through Book VIII, Chapter 2.
Apple provides Mac OS X with an all-in-one hardware and software display 
tool, aptly named System Profiler, which you can find in the Utilities folder 
within your Applications folder. You can also reach the Profiler through 
the Apple menu (Ú). Just click About This Mac and then click the More Info 
button.
As with the folders in a Finder window in List View mode, you can expand 
or collapse each major heading that appears in a Profiler screen. Just click 
the triangle that appears to the left of each Contents heading to expand or 
collapse that heading.
The System Profiler major headings include
 
✦ Hardware: This heading tells you volumes about your hard drives 
(forgive me, I couldn’t help that) as well as specifics concerning your 
optical drives; modem; AirPort and Bluetooth hardware; graphics 
hardware; AC power settings; and any FireWire, CardBus, and USB 
devices connected to your system. Figure 7-2 illustrates the information 
from my USB screen, with many of the devices expanded so that you 
can see them. (The text you see at the bottom half of the window is the 
detailed information on the item that’s selected.)
 
✦ Network: This heading shows a listing of your network configuration, 
active network connections, and other assorted network paraphernalia. 
You’ll probably need this screen only when asked by a technical support 
person for the network protocols that you’re using, but it’s handy 
nonetheless. (You’ll find details on your network connection here that 
you can’t find anywhere else in Snow Leopard.)

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
 
Figure 7-2: 
Display 
information 
about your 
Mac’s 
ports and

✦ Software: Okay, this heading shows something useful to the average 
human being! This screen lists all the applications, fonts, and preferences 
recognized on your start-up volume, along with their version numbers. 
If you’re wondering whether you need to update an application with a 
patch file (to fix bugs in the software) or update a file from the developer, 
you can look here to check the current version number for the application. 
You also get a rather boring list of the extensions (or drivers) used by 
Mac OS X applications. Logs are usually valuable only to tech support 
personnel; they document recent lockups, application crashes, and even 
system crashes.
Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
Our next stop in Maintenance City is a useful little application dubbed 
Activity Monitor, which is specially designed to show you just how hard your 
CPU, hard drive, network equipment, and memory modules are working 
behind the scenes. To run Activity Monitor, open the Utilities folder in your 
Applications folder.
To display each different type of usage, click the tabs in the lower half of the 
window; the lower pane changes to reflect the desired type (see Figure 7-3). 
For example, if you click System Memory, you see the amount of unused 
memory; click CPU or Network to display real-time usage of your MacBook’s 
CPU and network connections.

Figure 7-3:

You can also display a separate window with your CPU usage; choose 
Window➪CPU Usage or press Ô+2. There are three different types of 
central processing unit (CPU, which is commonly called the “brain” of 
your MacBook) displays available from Activity Monitor:
“Mark, what’s that arcane-looking list doing in 
the middle of the Activity Monitor window in 
Figure 7-3?” I’m glad you asked. A process is 
a discrete task (either visible or invisible) that 
Snow Leopard performs in order to run your 
applications. (Some processes are executed 
by Snow Leopard just to keep itself running.) 
For example, the Dock and Finder are actually 
processes, as are Adobe Acrobat and iPhoto.
You can quit a specific process within Activity 
Monitor. Just click the offending process in the 
list and then click the Quit Process button on 
the Activity Monitor toolbar. But tread carefully, 
Mr. Holmes, for there’s danger afoot. For example, 
deleting a system process (such as the Dock or 
Finder) can result in all of Mac OS X locking up! 
Therefore, delete a process only if instructed 
to do so by a support technician. If you need 
to terminate a misbehaving application, 
click the Apple menu and choose Force Quit 
instead.
Processes for dummies

Tracking Performance with Activity Monitor
 
✦ Floating CPU window: This is the smallest display of CPU usage; the 
higher the CPU usage, the higher the reading on the monitor. You can 
arrange the floating window in horizontal or vertical mode from the 
Window menu.
 
✦ CPU Usage window: This is the standard CPU monitoring window, 
which uses a blue thermometer-like display. The display works the same 
as the floating window.
 
✦ CPU History window: This scrolling display uses different colors to help 
indicate the percentage of CPU time being used by your applications 
(green) and what percentage is being used by Snow Leopard to keep 
things running (red). You can use the History window to view CPU usage 
over time.
The CPU usage and history displays can also be displayed in the Dock.
 
You have two bars in your CPU usage monitor because you’re running one 
of Apple’s multiple-core Intel processors in your MacBook. More than one 
engine is under the hood!
Whichever type of display you choose, you can drag the window anywhere 
that you like on your Mac OS X Desktop. Use the real-time feedback to 
determine how well your system CPU is performing when you’re running 
applications or performing tasks in Mac OS X. If this meter stays peaked 
for long periods of time while you’re using a range of applications, your 
processor(s) are running at full capacity.
 
You can even monitor CPU, network, hard drive, or memory usage right 
from the Dock! Choose View➪Dock Icon; then choose what type of real-time 
graph you want to display in your Dock. (Feeling like a Snow Leopard power 
user yet? I thought so.) When you’re monitoring CPU usage from the Dock, 
the green portion of the bar indicates the amount of processor time used by 
application software, and the red portion of the bar indicates the CPU time 
given to the Mac OS X operating system (same as how this works in the CPU 
History window).
 
Note, however, that seeing your CPU capacity at its max doesn’t necessarily 
mean that you need a faster CPU or a new computer. For example, when I’m 
running memory-ravenous applications, such as Photoshop or Word, the 
Activity Monitor on my MacBook Pro is often pegged (indicating maximum 
use) for several seconds at a time. The rest of the time, it barely moves. 
Whether a computer is actually fast enough for you and the applications that 
you run is more of a subjective call on your part.

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Another important application in your maintenance toolbox is Disk Utility, 
which you find — no surprise here — in the Utilities folder within your 
Applications folder. When you first run this program, it looks something like 
Figure 7-4, displaying all the physical disks and volumes on your system.
 
The Disk Utility application has its own toolbar that you can toggle on and 
off. Click the lozenge-shaped button at the upper-right corner of the window 
to display or hide the toolbar.
 
Figure 7-4: 
The familiar 
face of

Displaying the goods on your disks
The volume tree structure on the left of the Disk Utility window lists both 
the physical disks and the partitions that you’ve set up. A partition is nothing 
more than another word for volume, which is the formatted section of a disk 
that contains data. A single physical hard drive can contain several partitions. 
The information display at the bottom of the Disk Utility window contains 
data about both the volumes and the partitions on your hard drive.
To illustrate: On my system, clicking the drive labeled 320.07 GB (the 
physical hard drive at the top of the tree) displays a description of the drive 
itself, including its total capacity, interface (connection type), and whether 
the drive is internal or external. (See Figure 7-5.)

Clicking the tree entry for Wolfgang, however — that’s the name of the 
partition that I created when I formatted the drive — displays information 
about the type of formatting, the total capacity of the partition and how 
much of that is used, and the number of files and folders stored on the 
partition (as shown at the bottom of Figure 7-6).

Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Playing doctor with First Aid
From the First Aid pane, you can use Disk Utility to verify (or check) any disk 
(well, almost any disk) for errors, as well as repair most errors that it finds. 
Here are the two exceptions when the buttons are disabled:
 
✦ The start-up disk: Disk Utility can’t repair the start-up disk — that’s Mac 
talk for the boot drive that contains the Mac OS X system you’re using 
at the moment — which makes sense if you think about it, because that 
drive is currently being used!
 
 If you have multiple operating systems on multiple disks, you can boot 
from another Mac OS X installation on another drive to check your 
current start-up disk. Or you can boot your system from the original 
Mac OS X installation DVD and run Disk Utility from the Installation menu.
You might have noticed the New Image 
button on the Disk Utility toolbar (or the image 
creation commands on the File➪New 
submenu). If you’re wondering what a disk 
image is, you’ve come to the right place. Think 
of a disk image as a file that looks (and acts) 
like an external storage device within Snow 
Leopard; for example, a mounted disk image 
operates much like a CD or DVD, and it can 
be ejected just as a disc can. Images can be 
read-only (same as a standard CD-ROM or 
DVD-ROM) or they can be created blank (same 
as an empty hard drive), ready to accept files 
and folders that you copy using the Finder.
So what are images used for? They’re great 
for storing data that would normally have to be 
loaded from a CD or DVD (a great convenience 
if you don’t want to lug optical media along with 
you during a vacation). Remember, a disk image 
acts just the same as removable storage media 
as far as Snow Leopard’s concerned. Many 
Mac Web sites also offer images as download 
files because a simple double-click is all that’s 
necessary to automatically mount a disk image. 
(Software developers like words such as fast 
and simple when offering their shareware and 
demo applications to the public.)
Finally, images are often used to create simple 
archives of little-used data: The images can 
be burned to CD/DVD or even copied to other 
hard drives. Oh, and don’t forget the security 
aspect — you can choose to encrypt the data 
stored in an image, protecting it from prying 
eyes. (However, I don’t recommend using 
disk images to create full backups of your 
MacBook’s hard drives; more on this in the 
section “Hitching a ride on the Time Machine,” 
later in the chapter.) To restore a disk image — 
to move the files back to your hard drive — you 
can use the Restore tab in Disk Utility.
If you’re intrigued, I encourage you to click 
New Image on the Disk Utility toolbar (see 
Figure 7-5) and create a simple, unencrypted 
blank disk image on your Desktop. Then you 
can experiment with it. A disk image can be 
ejected to unmount it (same as with a CD/
DVD, an iPod, or a USB Flash drive), and you 
can delete the image file at any time. (Just 
remember not to delete it if it contains anything 
you want to keep, of course . . . but you knew 
that already.)
So what’s a disk image?

154
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
 
✦ Write-protected disks: Although you can use the Disk Utility to verify 
CDs and DVDs, Disk Utility can’t repair them. (Sound of my palm 
slapping my forehead.)
 
 You usually can’t repair a disk that has open files that are currently 
being used. If you’re running an application from a drive or you’ve 
opened a document that’s stored on that drive, you probably can’t 
repair that drive.
You can also elect to verify and repair permissions (or privileges) on a disk; 
these are the read/write permissions that I discuss in detail in Book III, 
Chapter 6. If you can’t save or move a file that you should be able to access, 
I recommend checking that drive for permissions problems. Although you 
can’t fix disk errors on a boot drive, you can verify and repair permissions 
on any volume that contains a Mac OS X installation (whether it was used to 
boot your MacBook or not).
 
In order to verify or repair, you must be logged in as an admin-level user.
To verify or repair a drive, first select the target volume/partition in the 
list at the left. To check the contents of the drive and display any errors, 
click the Verify Disk button. Or, to verify the contents of the drive and 
fix any problems, click the Repair Disk button. (I usually just click Repair 
Disk because an error-free disk needs no repairs.) Disk Utility displays any 
status or error messages in the scrolling list; if you have eagle eyes, you’ll 
note that the window can be resized so that you can expand it to display 
more messages. (You can also drag the dot between the left and right 
panes to expand the list.)
I generally check my disks once every two or three days. If your MacBook is 
caught by a power failure or Mac OS X locks up, however, it’s a good idea to 
immediately check disks after you restart your laptop. (Don’t forget that the 
start-up volume is automatically checked and repaired, if necessary.)
A number of very good commercial disk repair utilities are on the market. 
My favorite is Drive Genius 2 from Prosoft Engineering ($99; www.prosoft
eng.com) — however, Disk Utility does a good job on its own, and it’s free.
Erasing without seriously screwing up
“Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!” That’s right, Robot, it is indeed very easy 
to seriously screw up and get “Lost in Erase.” (Man, I can’t believe I actually 
typed such a bad pun. I have no shame.) Anyway, it’s time for another of 
Mark’s Maxims. To paraphrase the rules for handling a firearm responsibly:
 
Never click the Erase tab unless you mean to use it.

Book II
Chapter 7
The Joys of 
Maintenance 
155
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
Figure 7-7 illustrates the Erase controls within Disk Utility. You need to erase 
a disk or volume only when you want to completely wipe the contents of that 
existing disk or volume. You can also erase a rewritable CD (CD-RW) or DVD 
(DVD-RW, DVD+RW, or DVD-RAM) from this pane.
 
Figure 7-7: 
The Disk 
Utility Erase 
controls.
 
 
✦ Erasing an entire disk deletes all volumes on the disk and creates a single 
new, empty volume.
 
✦ Erasing a volume wipes only the contents of that specific volume, leaving 
all other volumes on the physical disk untouched.
To erase, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the disk or volume icon that you want to erase from the list on 
the left side of the screen.
 
2. Click the Erase tab.
 
3. Click the format that you want to use from the Format pop-up menu.
 
 Always choose Mac OS Extended (Journaled) entry from the Format list 
unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS File System (for 
compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX File System (for 
compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). In some cases, Disk Utility 
will force you to choose the Mac OS Extended entry instead, but the end 
result is the same. Note that you do not need to format a disk or volume 
with the MS-DOS File System just to read a file from a PC system — 
Mac OS X recognizes MS-DOS removable media (such as a USB drive 
formatted under Windows) without a problem.

156
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
 
4. In the Name field, type the name for the volume.
 
 If you’re erasing an existing volume, the default is the existing name.
 
5. If you’re worried about security, click Security Options and specify 
the method you want to use.
 
 By default, this is set to Don’t Erase Data, so Disk Utility doesn’t actually 
overwrite any data while formatting; instead, it simply trashes the 
existing directory, rendering that data unreachable. Or is it? With some 
third-party disk utilities, some unscrupulous bum could actually recover 
your files if you choose, so you can specify alternative, more secure 
methods of erasing a disk or volume. Unfortunately, these more secure 
erasure methods can take a horrendous amount of time.
 
 Therefore, it’s okay to use the Don’t Erase Data option unless you want 
to make sure that nothing can be recovered, or use the Zero Out Data 
to take a more secure route with the least amount of extra waiting. For 
example, you’d want to use the Zero Out Data option if you’re selling 
your MacBook on eBay and you’re formatting the drive for the new 
owner. If you’re really set on the tightest, government-quality security, 
select either 7-Pass Erase or 35-Pass Erase . . . but make sure you have 
plenty of time to spare!
 
 You can even click Erase Free Space to wipe the supposedly “clean” 
areas of your drive before you format. Man, talk about airtight security! 
Again, the Zero Out method is the fastest.
 
6. Click the Erase button.
 
 In the sheet that appears, click Erase to confirm that you do actually 
want to do the deleterious deed.
Partitioning the right way
From time to time, just about everyone wishes he or she had additional 
volumes handy for organizing files and folders, or at least a little extra 
space on a particular partition. If you find yourself needing another volume 
on a disk — or if you need to resize the total space on existing volumes on a 
disk — click the Partition tab within Disk Utility to display the controls that 
you see in Figure 7-8. (Make sure that you select a disk and not a volume.) 
From here, you can choose a volume scheme, creating anywhere from 1 to 
16 volumes on a single disk.
 
You can’t monkey around with the partitions on a start-up disk because 
Mac OS X is currently running on that disk. (Think about removing your own 
appendix, and you get the idea.) Also, if you resize an existing volume, you 
may lose files and folders on that volume — Disk Utility prompts you for 
permission, but it’s always a good idea to back up a partition before you 
resize it!

To set up the partitions on a disk, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Partition pane within Disk Utility, click the disk icon (left 
side of the pane) that you want to partition.
 
2. Click the Volume Scheme pop-up menu and choose the total number 
of volumes that you want on the selected disk.
 
3. Click the first volume block in the partition list (under the Volume 
Scheme pop-up menu) to select it.
 
 I have two partitions set for this disk, as you can see.
 
4. Click in the Name field and enter the name for the selected volume.
 
5. From the Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the volume.
 
 Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the 
Format menu unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS 
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the 
UNIX File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines).
 
6. Type a total size for this volume in the Size field.
 
7. After you set up your first volume partition, select the Locked for 
Editing check box to prevent any further changes to that volume.
 
8. If you’re creating multiple volumes, click the next volume block to 
select it and repeat Steps 4–7.
 
9. To delete a partition from your new scheme, click the unwanted 
volume and then click the Delete button to remove it.

158
Fixing Things with the Disk Utility
 
 If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before 
deleting it.
 10. To split a partition from your new scheme into two volumes, click the 
desired volume and then click the Split button.
 
 Some folks create multiple volumes so that they can boot from multiple 
versions of Snow Leopard — like us author types.
 
 If the partition is locked, clear the Locked for Editing check box before 
splitting it.
 
11. After everything is set to your liking, click the Apply button to begin 
the process.
 
 If you suddenly decide against a partition change, click the Revert 
button to return to the original existing partition scheme.
 
 The Revert button is available only before you click the Partition button!
If you have more than one partition, check out the bar(s) with a handle 
separating the volumes in the partition list. If you leave all your partitions 
unlocked (by leaving the Locked for Editing check box disabled), you can 
click and drag these separator bars to dynamically resize the volumes. This 
makes it easy to adjust the individual volume sizes for the disk until you get 
precisely the arrangement you want. If a volume is locked, it can’t be resized 
dynamically in this fashion.
RAID has nothing to do with insects
The next stop on the Disk Utility hayride isn’t for everyone — as a matter of 
fact, only a Mac OS X power user with a roomful of hardware is likely to use 
it. RAID, Redundant Array of Independent/Inexpensive Disks, is actually what 
it says. In normal human English, a RAID set is a group of multiple separate 
disks, working together as a team. RAID can
 
✦ Improve the speed of your system
 
✦ Help prevent disk errors from compromising or corrupting your data
The RAID controls within Disk Utility are illustrated in Figure 7-9. (Note that 
I’ve turned on the Disk Utility toolbar as well, just to show you what it looks 
like.) You need at least two additional hard drives on your system besides 
the start-up disk, which I don’t recommend that you use in a RAID set.
To set up a RAID array in Mac OS X, follow these steps:
 
1. From the RAID tab of Disk Utility, click and drag the disks from the list 
at the left to the Disk box at the right.

2. Click the RAID Type pop-up menu to specify the type of RAID that you 
need.
 
• Striped RAID Set: Choosing this can speed up your hard drive 
performance by splitting data between multiple disks.
 
• Concatenated RAID Set: Choosing this allows several volumes (or 
even multiple disks) to appear as one volume within Snow Leopard.
 
• Mirrored RAID Set: Choosing this increases the reliability of your 
storage by creating a mirror backup of that data across multiple 
disks.
 
3. Click in the RAID Set Name field and type the name for your RAID set.
 
4. From the Volume Format pop-up menu, choose a format for the 
volumes.
 
 Always use Mac OS Extended or Mac OS Extended (Journaled) from the 
Volume Format list unless you have a specific reason to use the MS-DOS 
File System (for compatibility with PCs running Windows) or the UNIX 
File System (for compatibility with UNIX/Linux machines). Journaling 
helps reduce the amount of disk fragmentation and also helps speed up 
your hard drive’s performance.

improvements to Mac OS X in the form of software updates. These updates 
can include all sorts of fun stuff, like
 
✦ Bug fixes
 
✦ Improvements and new features
 
✦ Enhanced drivers
 
✦ Security upgrades
 
✦ Firmware upgrades
Apple makes it easy to keep Mac OS X up-to-date with the Software Update 
controls in System Preferences.
 
You don’t even have to display the System Preferences window to check for 
new software updates manually. Click the Apple menu in the Finder menu 
bar and then choose Software Update to perform a manual check immediately.
To check for new updates periodically, display the Software Update pane in 
System Preferences and click the Scheduled Check tab. Select the Check for 
Updates check box and choose how often you want these updates from the 
pop-up menu. (I suggest at least weekly, if not daily.) For a manual check, 
make sure that you’re connected to the Internet and then click the Check 
Now button.
To download updates automatically, mark the Download Important Updates 
in the Background check box to enable it; the Big X politely downloads the 
updates behind the scenes and then alerts you that they’re ready to be 
installed. (With automatic downloading disabled, Mac OS X displays any 
available updates with short descriptions, and you can toggle the installation 
of a specific update by selecting or deselecting the check box next to it.)
 
I recommend installing all updates, even for hardware that you don’t have 
yet. For example, I always install AirPort updates even though I don’t use an 
AirPort connection at home. The reason? Often, the functionality covered by 
an update may include system software that you do use, so you still benefit 
from installing it. (Also, when I’m on the road with my MacBook and I do 
turn on AirPort, I’ll have the latest software.)
After you specify the updates that you want to install, click the Install button 
to begin the update process. You might have to reboot after everything has 
been installed.
To see which updates you’ve installed already, click the Installed Updates 
tab on the Software Update pane in System Preferences.

I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
I know we’re friends, but there’s no excuse for not backing up your data. 
The more valuable and irreplaceable your documents are, the more heinous 
it is to risk losing them. (I don’t get to use the word heinous in many of my 
books, but it fits really well here.)
Although Apple does include the ability to create disk images and restore 
them in the Disk Utility (see the “So what’s a disk image?” sidebar, earlier 
in this chapter), I don’t recommend that you use disk images as your 
comprehensive backup solution. (Insert sound of stunned silence here.) 
That’s because the restore process can be confusing, and the disk image 
method doesn’t offer the level of control that you need when it comes to 
backing up and restoring individual files and folders (or selectively backing 
up by date or recent use).
 
If you do create backup datasets using disk images, you can restore them 
from the Restore tab in Disk Utility. You can also restore from a volume — 
typically, a volume you want to restore would be saved on a DVD or an 
external hard drive.
“Okay, Mark, what do I use to back up my valuable data?” Well, good 
citizen, only a bona fide backup application gives you such flexibility and 
convenience . . . and that’s why Snow Leopard power users turn to Time 
Machine, a feature that makes restoring files as easy as pointing and clicking!
Hitching a ride on the Time Machine
If you enable backups through Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature, you 
can literally move backward through the contents of your MacBook’s hard 
drive, selecting and restoring all sorts of data. Files and folders are ridiculously 
easy to restore — and I mean easier than any restore you’ve ever performed, 
no matter what the operating system or backup program. Time Machine can 
even handle things like deleted Address Book entries and photos you’ve sent 
to the Trash from iPhoto!
Because Time Machine should be an important and integral part of every 
Mac owner’s existence, the Time Machine icon is included in the Dock. 
(Apple is not messing around!)
 
Before you can use Time Machine, it must be enabled within the Time 
Machine pane in System Preferences. I cover these settings in detail in 
Chapter 3 of Book III. I also recommend that you invest in an external USB 
or FireWire hard drive to hold your Time Machine backups.
Here’s how you can turn back time, step-by-step, to restore a file that you 
deleted or replaced in a folder:

162
I Demand That You Back Up Your Hard Drive
 
1. Open the folder that contained the file you want to restore.
 
2. In a separate window, open your Applications folder and launch the 
Time Machine application, or click the Time Machine icon in the 
Dock.
 
 The oh-so-ultra-cool Time Machine background appears behind your 
folder, complete with its own set of buttons at the bottom of the 
screen (as shown in Figure 7-10). On the right, you see a timeline that 
corresponds to the different days and months included in the backups 
that Snow Leopard has made.
 
Figure 7-10: 
Yes, Time 
Machine 
really does 
look like 
this!
 
 
3. Click within the timeline to jump directly to a date (displaying the 
folder’s contents on that date).
 
 Alternatively, use the Forward and Back arrows at the right to move 
through the folder’s contents through time. (You should see the faces 
of Windows users when you “riffle” through your folders to locate 
something you deleted several weeks ago!)
 
 The backup date of the items you’re viewing appears in the button bar 
at the bottom of the screen.

4. After you locate the file you want to restore, click it to select it.
 
5. Click the Restore button at the right side of the Time Machine 
button bar.
 
 If you want to restore all the contents of the folder, click the Restore All 
button instead.
Time Machine returns you to the Finder, with the newly restored file now 
appearing in the folder. OUTstanding!
 
To restore specific data from your Address Book or images from iPhoto, 
launch the desired application first and then launch Time Machine. Instead 
of riffling a Finder window, you can move through time within the application 
window.
For simple backup and restore protection, Time Machine is all that a typical 
MacBook owner at home is likely to ever need. Therefore, a very easy Mark’s 
Maxim to predict:
 
Connect an external hard drive and turn on Time Machine. Do it now. 
Don’t make a heinous mistake.
How about that? I got to use heinous twice in one chapter.
Using other backup solutions
Time Machine is indeed awesome, but some MacBook owners prefer a 
more traditional automated backup and restore process — one that doesn’t 
involve running the Time Machine application and navigating through 
the files and folders on a drive. For example, a person backing up a Mac 
acting as a Web server or iTunes media server would much rather restore 
the entire contents of a volume automatically, in bulk, or create a custom 
backup/restore schedule that safeguards only certain files and folders.
If you’re dead-set against Time Machine, you can turn to a commercial 
backup application for your salvation — my personal recommendation is 
EMC Retrospect, from EMC (www.retrospect.com). This well-written 
“software bungee cord” has saved my posterior more than once.
 
Using EMC Retrospect is cheap security, but if you can’t afford it at the 
moment, take a second to at least back up your most important documents 
by copying them to a rewriteable CD or DVD or a USB flash drive. With this 
poor man’s backup, even if you lose your entire hard drive, you can still 
restore what matters the most.

164
I Further Demand That You Defragment
I Further Demand That You Defragment
Defragmenting your hard drive can significantly improve its performance. 
Using a defragmenter scans for little chunks of a file that are spread out 
across the surface of your hard drive and then arranges them to form a 
contiguous file. After a file has been optimized in this way, it’s far easier and 
faster for Mac OS X to read than reassembling a fragmented file.
However, Apple dropped the ball on this one and didn’t include a defragmenter 
with Mac OS X. Luckily, many third-party disk utilities (such as the 
aforementioned Drive Genius 2 from Prosoft Engineering) also include a 
defragmenting feature. If you have a defragmenter, I recommend that you 
use it once a month.
Special Start-Up Keys for Those Special Times
Mac OS X includes a number of special keys that you can use during the 
boot process. These keys really come in handy when you need to force your 
operating system to do something that it normally wouldn’t, such as boot 
from a CD instead of the hard drive.
 
✦ To boot from a CD or DVD: Restart your MacBook while pressing the C 
key. This is a great way to free your startup volume when you want to 
test it or optimize it using a commercial utility.
 
✦ To eject a recalcitrant disc that doesn’t show up on the Desktop: 
Restart Mac OS X and press the Media Eject key as soon as you hear that 
magnificent startup chord.
 
✦ To use your MacBook as an external hard drive (also known as Target 
mode): Connect the two Macs using a FireWire cable and then hold 
down the T key on the MacBook keyboard while restarting or booting 
your laptop.
 
✦ To force your Mac to boot in Mac OS X: Hold down the X key while 
restarting or booting the MacBook.
 
✦ To display a system boot menu: Hold down the Option key while 
restarting or booting the MacBook, and you can choose which operating 
system you want to use.
 
✦ To prevent start-up applications from running during login: Hold down 
the Shift key while you click the Login button on the Login screen. If you 
don’t see the Login screen during startup, just hold down Shift while 
Mac OS X boots until the Finder menu appears.

Crave the Newest Drivers
Crave the Newest Drivers
No chapter on maintenance would be complete without a reminder to keep 
your hardware drivers current. Drivers are simply programs that allow your 
MacBook to control hardware devices, such as an external SATA (eSATA) 
card that you’ve added to your laptop. The Mac OS X Software Update 
feature that I discuss earlier, in the section “Updating Mac OS X,” provides 
most of the drivers that you need for things like printers, USB and FireWire 
peripherals, and digital cameras, but it’s still very important to check those 
manufacturer Web sites.
As can the software updates from Apple, updated drivers can fix bugs and 
even add new features to your existing hardware, which is my definition of 
getting something for nothing.

Book II: Using Mac OS X with Your MacBook

Chapter 8: Getting Help 
for the Big X
In This Chapter
✓ Using the Mac OS X Help Center
✓ Searching for specific help
✓ Getting help in applications
✓ Finding other help resources
W
hether the voice echoes from a living room, home office, or college 
computer lab, it’s all too familiar: a call for help. No matter how well 
written the application or how well designed the operating system, sooner 
or later you’re going to need support. That goes for everyone from the 
novice to the experienced MacBook owner to the occasional e-mail user to 
the most talented software developer.
In this short but oh-so-important chapter, I lead you through the various 
help resources available within Mac OS X as well as native Mac OS X 
applications. I show you how to tap additional resources from Apple, and I 
also point you to other suppliers of high-quality (as well as even questionable) 
assistance from sources on the Internet and in your local area.
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
Your first line of defense is the Mac OS X Help Viewer, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
To display the Help Viewer from the Finder menu, click Help and choose 
Mac Help; or you can press the Ô+? keyboard shortcut. This Help menu is 
context sensitive, so it contains different menu items when you’re working 
inside an application.
As shown in Figure 8-1, the Help Viewer is divided into three sets of controls:
 
✦ Toolbar: The toolbar includes navigational controls (Back, Forward, 
and Home buttons), an Action button (where you can print a topic or 
change the text size), and the Ask a Question (or Search) text box. On 
the far right, you see an Index link; click it to display an alphabetical 
index of help topics.

168
Displaying the Help Viewer Window
 
✦ Quick Clicks: Clicking these links takes you directly to some of the most 
frequently asked Help topics for the Finder (or the application you’re 
using), such as Connecting to the Internet and Switching from Windows. 
To use a Quick Click, just click once on the question that you want to 
pursue.
 
✦ Apple Web site link: Click this link to display the latest Mac OS X news 
and the latest Help topics from the Apple Web site.

I know that the Help Viewer looks a little sparse at first glance. However, 
when you realize how much information has to be covered to help someone 
with an operating system — check out the size of the book you’re holding, for 
instance — you get an idea of why Mac OS X doesn’t try to cover everything 
on one screen. Instead, you get the one tool that does it all: the Spotlight 
search box.

Searching for Specific Stuff
Searching for Specific Stuff
To search for the Help topic you need, here are two paths to righteousness:
 
✦ From the Finder Help menu: Wowzers! In Snow Leopard, you don’t 
even have to open the Help Viewer to search for assistance on a specific 
topic . . . just choose Help from the Finder menu, click in the Search field 
right there in the menu, and type a keyword or two. (Although you can 
ask a full-sentence question, I find that the shorter and more concise 
your search criteria are, the more relevant your results are.) As with the 
Spotlight search box, you don’t need to press Return; just click the topic 
that sounds the most helpful.
 
✦ From the Help Viewer: Click in the Search text box at the right side 
of the toolbar, type one or two words that sum up your question, and 
press Return. Figure 8-2 illustrates a typical set of topics concerning 
DVD movies.
 
Figure 8-2: 
The results 
of a search 
within 
the Help 
Viewer.
 
No matter which method you use, the topics are sorted by approximate 
relevance first. Within the Help Viewer, articles taken from the AppleCare 
Support section of the Apple Web site appear in the Support Articles portion 
of the window. (Because Web stuff is going on in the background, you don’t 
see these articles unless your MacBook has an active Internet connection.)

170
Prodding Apple for the Latest Gossip
You can double-click any topic to display the topic text, which looks like the 
text that you see in Figure 8-3.
 
Figure 8-3: 
A typical 
topic within 
the Help 
Viewer.
 
To move back to the previous topic that you chose, click the Back button on 
the Help Viewer toolbar.
Prodding Apple for the Latest Gossip
As I mention in the earlier section, “Displaying the Help Viewer Window,” 
in this chapter, I heartily recommend that you visit the Apple Web site at 
www.apple.com and surf wildly to and fro. You’ll often pick up on news and 
reviews that you won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.
From the opening Web screen, click the Hot News link on the Apple tab and 
the Support tab during every visit to the Apple site. These pages give you
 
✦ Articles about the latest news from Cupertino
 
✦ Downloads of the latest Mac OS X freeware, shareware, and demo-ware
 
✦ The Knowledge Base (an online searchable troubleshooting reference)
 
✦ News about upcoming versions of Mac OS X and Apple applications 
galore
You’ll also find Mac OS X product manuals in Adobe Acrobat PDF format and 
online discussion forums that cover Mac OS X.

Calling for Help Deep in the Heart of X
A number of different help avenues are available within Mac OS X applications 
as well. They include
 
✦ The Help button: A number of otherwise upstanding Mac OS X windows, 
dialogs, and System Preference panes include a Help button, as shown 
in the lower right of Figure 8-4. Click the button marked with ? to display 
the text for the settings in that dialog or window.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Notice the 
not-so-well-
camouflaged 
Help button.
 
 
✦ Pop-up help for fields and controls: Most Mac OS X applications display 
a short line of help text when you hover the mouse pointer on top of a 
field or control. Sometimes it’s just the name of the item; sometimes it’s 
a full descriptive line. Them’s the breaks.
 
✦ Application-specific help: Applications typically have their own Help 
system, which can use the Help Viewer, a separate Help display program, 
or a HyperText Markup Language (HTML; read that Web-based) Help 
system.
Other Resources to Chew On
Although the Help Viewer can take care of just about any question that you 
might have about the basic controls and features of Mac OS X, you might 
also want to turn to other forms of help when the going gets a little rougher. 
In this last section, I cover resources that you can call on when the Help 
Viewer just isn’t enough.

172
Other Resources to Chew On
Voice support
As of this writing, Apple provides voice technical support for Mac OS X. You 
can find the number to call in your MacBook’s printed manuals or online in 
the Support section of the Apple Web site. However, exactly when you 
qualify for voice support and exactly how long it lasts depends on a number 
of different factors, such as whether you received Mac OS X when you 
bought a new machine, or whether you purchased a support plan from 
Apple.
You can also try the general online support site at www.info.apple.com — 
it’s a great starting point for obtaining Mac OS X help.
Mac publications and resource sites
You can refer to a number of great Mac-savvy publications and resources, 
both printed and online, for help. My favorites include
 
✦ Macworld (www.macworld.com) and MacLife (www.macaddict.com) 
magazines, both in archaic hard copy and oh-so-slick online versions
 
✦ MacGamer (www.macgamer.com), the online gaming resource for the 
Macintosh
 
✦ VersionTracker (www.versiontracker.com), an online resource for 
the latest updates on all sorts of Macintosh third-party applications
 
✦ MacFixIt (www.macfixit.com), a well-respected troubleshooting site 
devoted to the Mac that offers downloads, news, and discussion areas (a 
subscription is required for some of the more useful sections of the site)
 
In most of my books, I mention specific Internet newsgroups that cater to 
the topic I’m discussing; however, virtually all the Mac-specific newsgroups 
are devoted to illegally swapping pirated games and applications, so I don’t 
cover them. Also, the help that you receive from individuals in newsgroups 
is sometimes misguided — and sometimes downright wrong — so take any 
claims with a grain of salt.
 
As a general rule, never identify yourself or provide your snail-mail or e-mail 
addresses in a newsgroup post! These messages are public, and they remain 
hanging around in cyberspace on newsgroup servers for years — you’ll be a 
prime target for spam (or even worse).

Other Resources to Chew On
Local Mac outlets and user groups
Finally, you can find local resources in any medium-sized to large town 
or city: A shop that’s authorized by Apple to sell and repair Macintosh 
computers can usually be counted upon to answer a quick question over the 
phone or provide more substantial support for a fee. (For example, my local 
Mac outlet sponsors inexpensive classes for new MacBook owners, and if 
you can reach an Apple Store, the Genius Bar is a great resource.)
You might also be lucky enough to have a local Macintosh user group that 
you can join — members can be counted on for free answers to your sup-
port questions at meetings and demonstrations. To find a group near you, 
visit the Apple User Group Support site at www.apple.com/usergroups 
and use the locator.

Book II: Using Mac OS X with Your MacBook

Chapter 9: Troubleshooting the X
In This Chapter

✓ Performing the radical solutions
✓ Checking troubleshooting resources
M
ac OS X Snow Leopard is rugged, stable, and reliable — and as you 
can read in Chapter 7 of this minibook, practicing regular maintenance 
can help eliminate problems caused by everything from power failures to 
faulty software drivers to cats on the keyboard. However, sooner or later 
you will encounter what I like to call The Dark Moments . . . a blank screen, 
a locked MacBook, or an external device that sits there uselessly like an 
expensive paperweight.
How you handle The Dark Moments defines you as a true Mac OS X power 
user because most folks seem to fall into one of two categories: Either you 
panic and beat your head against the wall (which really has little effect on 
the computer, when you think about it), or you set your brow in grim 
determination and follow the troubleshooting models that I provide in this 
chapter to locate (and hopefully fix) the source of the problem.
Don’t Panic!
My friend, this is the first — and most important — rule of troubleshooting, 
and yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
 
Whatever the problem, you can fix it (or get it fixed).
Most computer owners seem to forget the idea that a hardware or software 
error can be fixed because they panic — they simply see The Problem, and 
somehow they feel that they’ll never be able to use their computer again.
Although the situation might look grim, don’t ignore these facts:
 
✦ You don’t need to scrap your MacBook. As long as you haven’t taken a 
hammer or a chainsaw to your laptop, the problem is only temporary. 
Sure, individual components do fail over time — heck, so do people — 
but the problem is certainly something that can be tracked down and 
fixed without scrapping your entire computer.

176
The Troubleshooting Process
 
✦ Don’t beat yourself up. As long as you haven’t installed a virus on 
purpose or deleted half your system files to spite yourself, the problem 
isn’t your fault. Sure, it’s possible that you might have done something 
by accident, but don’t blame yourself — it happens to everybody.
 
✦ Trust your Apple dealer. As long as an Apple dealer is in your area, you 
can always get your computer repaired professionally if a component’s 
gone south. (In some cases, professional help is a necessity: For example, 
swapping out a MacBook motherboard requires an Apple technician, 
unless you have copious experience.)
 
✦ Rely on your backup. As long as you’ve made a backup, you won’t lose 
much (if any) work. (You did back up your hard drive, didn’t you? I harp 
about backups further in Chapter 7 of this minibook.) I’m talking about a 
backup to an external hard drive here, using either an application such 
as Disk Utility or Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature.
Commit these facts to head and heart, and you can rest easy while you track 
down and attack the real enemy — whatever’s causing the problem.
The Troubleshooting Process
When I first conceived this chapter, I had originally decided to divide this 
section into separate hardware and software troubleshooting procedures. 
However, that turned out to be impractical because often you won’t know 
whether a problem is caused by hardware or software until you’re practically 
on top of it.
Therefore, here’s the complete 12-step troubleshooting process that I 
designed while working as a consultant and Macintosh hardware technician 
for 15 years. Feel free to add your own embellishments in the margin or 
include reminders with sticky notes.
 
If you’re not sure quite what’s producing the error, this process is designed 
to be linear — meaning that you should follow it in order — but if you 
already know that you’re having a problem with one specific peripheral or 
one specific application, feel free to jump to the steps that concern only 
hardware or software.
 
It’s always a good idea to create a completely default user account for 
troubleshooting. Techs call this a vanilla or clean account. You can use the 
vanilla account to test whether a problem occurs system-wide or is limited to 
a single user account. For example, this is a great way to determine whether 
an application is misbehaving because of a corrupted preference file: If the 
same problem doesn’t appear when you use the application with the vanilla 
account, the culprit is likely the user’s copy of the application’s preference 
file. (Follow the instructions provided by the application for resetting or 
deleting the preference file it creates.)

Book II
Chapter 9
Troubleshooting 
the X
177
The Troubleshooting Process
Step 1: Always try a simple shutdown
You’d be amazed at how often a reboot (the process of shutting down and 
restarting) can cure a temporary problem. For example, this can fix the 
occasional lockup in Mac OS X or a keyboard that’s not responding because 
of a power failure. If possible, make sure that you first close any open 
documents; otherwise, you might lose unsaved work. When troubleshooting, 
always do a shutdown instead of simply restarting the computer because 
when Mac OS X shuts down, all the hardware components that make up your 
system are reset.
 
If your MacBook is locked tight and you can’t use the Shut Down command 
from the Apple menu (Ú), press and hold the Power button on your laptop 
for a few seconds (which turns your computer off).
Step 2: Check all cable connections
Check all connections: the AC power cord, as well as any modem or network 
connections and all cable connections to external peripherals. Look for 
loose connectors — and if you have a cat or dog, don’t forget to check for 
chew marks. (Yep, that’s the voice of experience talking there.) If you’ve 
recently replaced a cable — especially a network, Universal Serial Bus (USB), 
or FireWire cable — replace it with a spare to see whether the problem still 
occurs.
Step 3: Retrace your steps
If the problem continues to occur, the next step is to consider what you’ve 
done in the immediate past that could have affected your MacBook. Did you 
install any new software or have you connected a new peripheral? If your 
MacBook was working fine until you made the change to your system, the 
problem likely lies in the new hardware or software.
 
✦ If you added an external device: Turn off your MacBook and disconnect 
the peripheral. Then turn on the laptop to see whether all proceeds 
normally. If so, check the peripheral’s documentation and make sure 
that you correctly installed the driver — the software provided by the 
device manufacturer — and that you connected it properly to the right 
port. (You can also use System Profiler, which I discuss later in this 
chapter, to check to see whether your MacBook recognizes the external 
device.) To verify that the cable works, substitute another cable of the 
same type or try the peripheral on another Mac.
 
 Make it a practice to check the manufacturer’s Web site for the latest 
driver when you get new hardware. The software that ships in the box 
with your new toy could have been on the shelf for months before being 
sold, and the manufacturer has probably fine-tuned the driver in the 
interim. You should also run Software Update to verify that the drivers 
that Apple supplies are up-to-date.

178
The Troubleshooting Process
 
✦ If you installed new software or applied an update/patch: Follow the 
guidelines in Chapter 7 of this minibook to uninstall the application and 
search for any files that it might have created elsewhere. (Searching 
by date created and date modified can help you locate files that were 
recently created.) If this fixes the problem, it’s time to contact the 
developer and request technical support for the recalcitrant program; 
you can always re-install the program after the problem has been solved 
by the developer.
 
 Not all versions of Mac OS X are created equal. If you’ve recently 
upgraded to a major or minor new release of Mac OS X, some of the 
applications that you’ve been using without trouble for months can 
suddenly go on the warpath and refuse to work (or exhibit quirky 
behavior). If this happens, visit the developer’s Web site often to look 
for a patch file that will update the application to work with the new 
version of Mac OS X.
 
✦ If you recently made a change within System Preferences: It’s possible 
that you’ve inadvertently “bumped” something. For instance, you might 
have accidentally changed your modem or network settings or perhaps 
made a change to your login options. Verify the settings screens that 
you visited to make sure that everything looks okay.
Step 4: Run Disk Utility
Next, run Disk Utility (as shown in Figure 9-1) to check for disk errors and 
permissions errors — especially permissions errors, which can wreak 
absolute havoc on just about any application on your hard drive. (Click 
the Disk Utility icon in the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder. 
Chapter 7 of this minibook provides all the details.)
Step 5: Run antivirus software
Run your antivirus software and scan your entire system for viruses, including 
all system disks and removable disks. Although Mac OS X doesn’t come with 
antivirus protection built in, Intego’s VirusBarrier X5 (www.intego.com) 
can constantly scan each file that you open or download for infections.
 
If you haven’t already set your antivirus application to automatically update 
itself, download the latest virus update — usually called a signature file or 
data file — to keep your virus protection current.
Step 6: Check the Trash
Check the contents of your Trash to make sure that you haven’t inadvertently 
tossed something important that could be causing trouble for an application. 
Click the Trash icon in the Dock to open the Trash window and peruse its 
contents. (To see the file types easier, switch to List mode.) To restore items 
to their rightful place, drag them from the Trash back to the correct folder 
on your hard drive.

Step 8: Disable troublesome Login Items
Disable any Login Items that might be causing trouble. As you can read in 
Book III, Chapter 3, Login Items are launched automatically as soon as you 
log in. For example, an older application that doesn’t fully support Snow 
Leopard can cause problems if used as a Login Item (such as an older 
version of a disk-scanning utility for use with Mac OS X Jaguar or Tiger). 
You can do this from the Login Items settings in the System Preferences 
Accounts pane (as shown in Figure 9-2); click the Apple menu, choose 
System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Items tab.
Unfortunately, if a Login Item doesn’t display an error message, your old 
friend Trial-and-Error is just about the only sure-fire way to detect which 
item (if any) is causing the problem. Click an item to select it, click the 
Remove button (marked with a minus sign), and then press Ô+Q to quit 
System Preferences. Log out to see whether the problem’s solved. (If not, 
don’t forget to add the item again to the Login Items list.)

180
The Troubleshooting Process
 
Figure 9-2: 
A 
misbehaving 
Login Item 
can cause 
you a world 
of grief.
 
 
You can also disable Login Items entirely when you reboot. If the login 
window appears when you reboot your computer, hold down the Shift key 
and then click the Login button. If you don’t see the login window when you 
reboot, hold down the Shift key when you see the James Bond–style twirling 
progress indicator in the startup window and continue to hold down the key 
until the Finder appears.
Step 9: Turn off your screen saver
Another candidate for intermittent lockups is your screen saver, especially 
if you’re running a shareware effort written by a 12-year-old with a limited 
attention span. Display your System Preferences, choose Desktop & Screen 
Saver, and click the Screen Saver tab. You can deactivate the saver entirely 
(by moving the Start Screen Saver slider to Never) or choose the Computer 
Name saver (which is provided by Apple) from the Screen Savers list.
Step 10: Check for write protection
If you’re running a multiuser ship, check to make sure that another user with 
administrator access hasn’t accidentally write-protected your documents, 
your application, or its support files. If possible, log in with an administrator 
account yourself (as I describe in Book III, Chapter 5) and then try running 
the application or opening the document that you were unable to access 
under your own ID.
 
Trying an application under the aforementioned “clean” account is also a 
great way to determine whether your user-specific preference file for that 
application has been corrupted. If you can run the application using your 
“clean” account, contact the software developer to see how you can repair 
or delete a preference file that’s causing problems.

Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
Step 11: Check your System Profiler
If you’ve reached this point in the troubleshooting process and haven’t 
found the culprit, you’ve probably experienced a hardware failure in your 
MacBook. If possible, display the Hardware category within the Apple 
System Profiler (see Figure 9-3) and make sure that it can recognize and use 
all the internal drives, ports, and external devices on your MacBook. To start 
the System Profiler, click the Apple menu, choose About This Mac, and then 
click the More Info button.
 
Figure 9-3: 
Use System 
Profiler to 
check the 
devices and 
ports on 
your system.
 
Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X Installation disc
In case your MacBook is in sad shape and won’t even boot from its hard 
drive, here’s a last step that you can take before you seek professional 
assistance: Reboot your laptop from the Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installation 
disc. Hold down the C key immediately after you hear the startup chord 
(which boots your system from the DVD-ROM drive) and then run Disk 
Utility from the Installation DVD’s Apple menu that appears. Because 
you’ve booted the system from the installation disc, you can verify and 
repair problems with your startup hard drive. (Some new MacBook models 
also come with a diagnostic DVD that can help you pin down hardware 
problems.) After you’re done, restart your system.
Do I Need to Reinstall Mac OS X?
To be honest, this is a difficult question to answer. Technically, you should 
never need to reinstall the Big X, but there’s also no reason why you can’t.

182
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
I can think of only two scenarios where reinstalling the operating system 
will likely solve a problem. One, if your system files have been so heavily 
corrupted — by a faulty hard drive or a rampaging virus, for example — that 
you can’t boot Mac OS X at all. Two, if the operating system encounters 
the death-dealing kernel panic on a regular basis. A kernel panic displays a 
dialog that instructs you to restart your MacBook (in multiple languages, 
no less), usually overwriting whatever’s on the monitor at the time. (This is 
analogous to the infamous Windows Blue Screen of Death — I’ve grown to 
hate that shade of blue with a passion.)
 
If you receive kernel panics on an ongoing basis, something is really, really 
wrong. Make sure that your documents are copied to a rewriteable DVD or 
network drive, and don’t overwrite any existing backup that you have with a 
new backup because the backup application is likely to lock up as well.
To reinstall, you must reboot from your Mac OS X Snow Leopard Installation 
disc. Hold down the C key immediately after you hear your MacBook’s 
startup chord. (Read the earlier section, “Step 12: Reboot with the Mac OS X 
Installation disc.”)
It’s Still Not Moving: Troubleshooting Resources
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can pursue other avenues to get 
help when you can’t solve a troubleshooting problem on your own. Mind 
you, I’m talking about professional help from sources that you can trust. 
Although you can find quite a bit of free advice on the Internet (usually on 
privately run Web sites and in the Internet newsgroups), most of it isn’t 
worth your effort. In fact, some of it’s downright wrong. That said, here are 
some sources that I do recommend.
The Mac OS X Help Viewer
Although most Mac OS X owners tend to blow off the Help Viewer when the 
troubleshooting gets tough, that’s never the best course of action. Always 
take a few moments to search the contents of the Help Viewer — click Help 
on the Finder menu — to see whether any mention is made of the problem 
that you’ve encountered.

The Apple Mac OS X Support site
Home to all manner of support questions and answers, the Mac OS X 
Support section of the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/support) should 
be your next stop in case of trouble that you can’t fix yourself. Topics 
include
 
✦ Startup issues
 
✦ Internet and networking problems
 
✦ Printing problems
You can search the Apple Knowledge Base, download the latest updates and 
electronic manuals, and participate in Apple-moderated discussion boards 
from this one central location.
Your local Apple dealer
Naturally, an Apple dealer can provide just about any support that you’re 
likely to need — for a price — but you can usually get the answers to 
important questions without any coinage changing hands. Your dealer is 
also well versed in the latest updates and patches that can fix those software 
incompatibility problems. Check your telephone book for your local dealer.

Finder of Your Dreams
In This Chapter
✓ Choosing a view mode
✓ Modifying the toolbar
✓ Searching for files from the toolbar
✓ Searching for files with the Find command
✓ Changing view options
✓ Changing Finder preferences
T
he Finder is the heart of Mac OS X — and we all know how heart 
surgeons like to tinker, don’t we? (Ouch. Start again.)
The Finder is the heart of Mac OS X, and as you might expect, it’s highly 
configurable. You can customize the Finder to present icons, or you can 
peruse folders with a column view that can pack much more information 
on-screen at one time. Some folks prefer the default Finder toolbar, and 
others like to customize it with the applications and features that they use 
most often.
Decisions like these can help you transform Snow Leopard into Your 
Personal Operating System — and every Mac OS X power user worth the title 
will take the time to apply these changes because an operating system that 
presents visual information the way that you want to see it is easier and 
more efficient to use.
No need for a hammer or saw — when you’re building the Finder of your 
dreams, the only tool that you need is your finger!

Will That Be Icons or Lists or Columns . . . or Even a Flow?
Will That Be Icons or Lists or Columns . . . 
or Even a Flow?
The default appearance of a window in Mac OS X uses the familiar large-
format icons that have been a hallmark of the Macintosh operating system 
since Day One — but there’s no reason you have to use them. (In fact, most 
Mac OS X power users I know consider the icon view mode rather inefficient 
and slow.) Besides the icon view, as shown in Figure 1-1, Mac OS X offers 
three other window view modes: list, column, and flow.
 
Figure 1-1: 
A Finder 
window in 
icon view 
mode.
 
 
 Mac OS X old-timers will thrill to the slider control at the bottom-right 
corner of Finder windows in icon view mode. Why? Drag this control to 
the right to expand the size of the icons within the window, and drag the 
control to the left to reduce the icon size! (This is A Big Thing for those 
who prefer icon view — and it makes quite a difference for those with 
less-than-perfect eyesight.)
 
✦ List view: List view displays the folders on the volume in a hierarchical 
fashion. To display the contents of a folder, you can either click the right-
facing small triangle next to the folder name — it rotates downward to 
indicate that you’ve expanded the folder — or you can double-click the 
folder icon to display the contents in a Finder window. To collapse the 
contents of the folder, click the small triangle again; it rotates back to 
face the right. Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Finder window in list view.
 
 You can resize a column by dragging the right edge of the column heading.

Figure 1-2: 
The

of a Finder 
window in

mode.
 
 
✦ Column view: Figure 1-3 shows the same window in column view, in 
which the volumes on your Mac OS X system are displayed on the 
left. Each column on the right represents a lower level of subfolders. 
Click the volume in the Devices list and then click the desired folder 
in the first column on the right to display its contents, and so forth. 
(Personally, this is my favorite view — thanks, Apple! It’s efficient and 
fast as all get-out.) When you drill deeper, the columns shift automatically 
to the left. When you click an item (instead of a folder), the Finder 
displays a preview and a quick summary of the selected item in the 
rightmost column.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Snow 
Leopard’s 
column view 
requires 
very little 
scrolling.
 

190
Will That Be Icons or Lists or Columns . . . or Even a Flow?
 
 Each column has its own scroll bar (for those really, really big folders), 
and you can drag the column handle at the bottom of the separators to 
resize the column width to the left. When you hold down Option and 
drag a column handle, all the columns are adjusted at once.
 
✦ Flow view: When a new software feature or function turns out to be 
incredibly popular, a developer tries to use it wherever possible — 
hence the Flow view shown in Figure 1-4, which Apple took directly 
from the Cover Flow view that proved so successful in iTunes (as well 
as on the iPhone and iPod touch). Flow view still displays the sidebar, 
but each document or item is showcased in a preview pane (and with 
an accurate thumbnail, if possible). You can resize the preview pane 
by dragging the three-line handle on the bottom edge of the pane. The 
remainder of the Finder window in Flow view works very similarly to list 
view, complete with the rotating triangles. However, if you like, you can 
click the scroll buttons or drag the scroll bar under the preview pane to 
move through the contents of your drive in a very classy visual display!

Another of my pet peeves is cluttered disks. If you’re continually having 
problems locating files and folders, ask yourself, “Self, do I need to organize? 
Am I — gasp — cluttered?” If your answer is yes, take an hour and organize 
your files logically into new folders. (Remember, I’m talking your documents 
and such — not your applications, which are usually where they need to 
be — in your Applications folder.) Often, documents that you create end up 
as stragglers, usually located in the root folder of your hard drive, which 
sooner or later ends up looking like a biker bar after Ladies’ Night. (The 
same can be said of many Mac OS X Desktops, too.) By keeping your root 
folder and Desktop clean and saving your files in organized folders, you 
waste less time searching for files and more time actually using them.

Doing the Toolbar Dance
To switch between the four modes, click one of the four view mode buttons 
on the Finder window toolbar (the current view is highlighted) or click the 
View menu and choose As Icons, As List, As Columns, or As Cover Flow. 
Mac OS X places a helpful check mark next to the current view mode. 
(Keyboard lovers can hold down Ô and press the 1, 2, 3, or 4 keys to switch 
views.)
Doing the Toolbar Dance
You can work your customization magic on the Finder toolbar as well! In 
this section, I show you how to customize that strip of icons across the top 
of the Finder window that’s affectionately called the toolbar. Or, if you like, 
you’ll discover how to dismiss it entirely to gain additional real estate for the 
contents of your Finder window. 
Hiding and showing the toolbar
You can toggle the display of the toolbar in an active Finder window in one 
of three ways:
 
✦ By clicking the toolbar button located at the upper-right corner of the 
Finder window
 
✦ By pressing Ô+Option+T
 
✦ By choosing View from the Finder menu and then choosing Hide (or 
Show) Toolbar
Hiding the toolbar also hides the Sidebar, which many MacBook owners 
dislike — me included.
Hiding and showing the status bar
The status bar at the bottom of the Finder window displays a number of 
helpful informational-type tidbits about the window’s contents. Depending 
on what you’ve opened, the status bar can include
 
✦ Statistics: See the number of items in the window and the amount of free 
space remaining on the volume.
 
✦ A write-protect icon: This icon looks like a pencil with a line running 
through it, as shown in Figure 1-5. This indicates that you don’t have 
write permissions for the contents of the window — or the volume 
where the contents reside. (Note that this doesn’t necessarily mean that 
folders at a lower level are write-protected as well.) You’ll typically see 
this icon when you’re viewing the contents of a CD or DVD, where 
everything is write-protected.

192
Doing the Toolbar Dance
 
Figure 1-5: 
Check the 
status bar 
to scope out 
your write 
permissions.
 
 
✦ The current automatic icon view setting: For windows in icon view, the 
status bar can display either a grid icon (indicating that the icons are 
set to snap-to-grid) or four tiny icons (indicating that the icons are 
displayed in a sorted order). You’ll discover more about these settings 
in the section “Configuring the View Options,” later in this chapter.
 
To toggle the display of the status bar, choose View from the Finder menu 
and then choose Show/Hide Status Bar.
Giving your toolbar big tires and a loud exhaust
The default icons on the toolbar include
 
✦ Back and Forward: As with a Web browser, clicking the Back button 
moves you to the previous window’s contents. If you use the Back 
button, the Forward button appears. Click this to return to the contents 
that you had before clicking the Back button.
 
✦ View: Click this control to toggle between the four view modes (icon, 
list, column, or flow).
 
✦ Quick Look: Click this control to display a window with the contents 
of the selected file or document without launching the corresponding 
application. Quick Look works with all sorts of images, video, and 
documents, allowing you to efficiently peruse files on your system without 
the hassle of constantly launching and quitting applications. Quick Look 
works in any Finder window view mode, too. To activate Quick Look 
for a selected file from the keyboard, press the spacebar.

Book III
Chapter 1
Building the Finder 
of Your Dreams
193
Doing the Toolbar Dance
 
 While Quick Look is active, a number of format-specific buttons appear 
at the bottom of the Quick Look window. For example, displaying an 
image file in Quick Look adds a button that can automatically import 
the image into iPhoto. These buttons vary with the format or type of 
document, but you’ll always see a full-screen/exit full-screen button that 
toggles the Quick Look window between full-screen and regular size.
 
Pssst. Selecting a folder and pressing the spacebar displays a summary of its 
size and last modification date. Pass it on.
 
✦ Action: Click this pop-up menu to display context-sensitive commands 
for the selected items. In plain English, you’ll see the commands that 
you’d see if you held down Control and clicked the selection.
 
✦ Search: Okay, I know it’s not technically an icon, but the Search box is 
a member of the default toolbar family nonetheless. You can search for 
a file or folder using this box. More on this in the section “Searching for 
Files from the Toolbar,” later in this chapter.
But, as one of my favorite bumper stickers so invitingly asks, “Why be 
normal?” Adding or deleting items from the toolbar is a great way to 
customize Mac OS X. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the active Finder window menu, choose View➪Customize 
Toolbar (or right-click the toolbar and choose Customize Toolbar) to 
display the sheet that you see in Figure 1-6.
 
Figure 1-6: 
Changing 
the toolbar 
status 
quo in 
Mac OS X.
 

194
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
 
 Along with controls such as Back, Forward, and View, you find a number 
of system functions, such as Eject and Burn.
 
2. To add items to the toolbar, drag them from the Customize Toolbar 
dialog up to the toolbar at the top of the window.
 
 To add an item between existing buttons, drop it between the buttons, 
and they obligingly move aside. If you get exuberant about your toolbar 
and you add more icons than it can hold, a double-right arrow appears 
at the right side of the toolbar. A click of the arrow displays a pop-up 
menu with the icons that won’t fit.
 
 In fact, the Customize Toolbar dialog isn’t necessary for some toolbar 
modifications: You can also drag files, folders, and disk volumes directly 
from the Desktop or other Finder windows and add them to your toolbar 
at any time. To remove a file, folder, or disk volume from the toolbar, 
hold down Control and click (or right-click) the icon on the toolbar; then 
click Remove Item from the shortcut menu — it vanishes like a CEO’s 
ethics.
 
 You can also hold down Ô and drag any item off the toolbar, or hold 
down Ô and drag toolbar items to reorder them.
 
 You can always drag a file or folder into the Sidebar column at the left 
of the Finder window. (The Sidebar column is a separate entity entirely 
from the toolbar.)
 
3. To remove an item from the toolbar, drag it off to the center of the 
window, amongst the other icons.
 
4. Naturally, you can swap item positions. Just click an item, drag it to its 
new spot, and then lift your finger from the trackpad.
 
5. To choose the default toolbar configuration or to start over, drag the 
default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top.
 
 This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together 
three times and repeating, “There’s no place like home.”
 
6. To toggle between displaying the icons with accompanying text (the 
default), the icon only, or a text button only, click the Show pop-up 
menu at the bottom of the Customize Toolbar dialog.
 
7. After you arrange your toolbar as you like, click the Done button.
Searching for Files from the Toolbar
Need to find a file fast? The default toolbar has just what you need: the 
Search field, which offers the ability to perform a Spotlight search for a string 
of text within your files (including both filenames and contents). To locate a 
file with the Search field, follow these steps:

Book III
Chapter 1
Building the Finder 
of Your Dreams
195
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
 
1. Click in the Search box on the toolbar and type the text that you want 
to find.
 
 It’s the text box on the right with the magnifying glass. (The folks at 
Apple are really, really into Sherlock Holmes . . . as am I!) If you need to 
clear the field and start over, click the circular X button, which appears 
only when text is in the Search field.
 
 Hey, who needs to press Return? The Finder immediately displays the files 
with names (or contents) that include the text, as shown in Figure 1-7.
 
Figure 1-7: 
Locating 
a file or 
folder with 
the toolbar 
Search box.
 
 
2. To display the location of a file, click it once. To launch it, 
double-click the entry.
 
 Files can also be moved or copied from the Search results list with the 
standard drag and Option+drag methods.
 
3. To perform a new search, click the circular X button and type new 
text in the Search field.
 
 To return to your original location in the Finder window, click the Back 
button on the toolbar.
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
Although the Search box on the toolbar is all you usually need to find most 
files and folders, sometimes you need a little more flexibility and power 
to locate what you need on your system. To do so, add the Find controls, 
which you can use to create custom searches with more complex criteria. 
To locate a file by using the Find controls, follow these steps:

196
Searching for Files from the Find Dialog
 
1. With the Finder active, display the Find controls by pressing Ô+F (or 
choose File from the Finder menu and then choose Find).
 
 Mac OS X displays the controls that you see in Figure 1-8.
 
Figure 1-8: 
The Find 
controls add 
a bit of extra 
power to a 
search.
 
 
2. Click the buttons at the top of the list to specify where you want to 
search.
 
 You can choose Computer (your entire system, including network 
volumes), a local volume, or your Home folder.
 
3. To search for a specific filename, click the first pop-up menu in a 
row and choose Name; then type all or part of the filename in the 
Contains box.
 
 Snow Leopard automatically begins searching as soon as you type at 
least one character.
 
 After you locate the file or folder that you need, click the entry name to 
reveal the location of the matching file or folder. You can also double-
click it to launch (or display) it.
 
4. If you want to search for a text string within the document itself, click 
the first pop-up menu in a row, choose Contents, and then type the 
string to match in the box.

Book III

197
Configuring the View Options
 
 The text must appear just as you’ve typed it, so it’s always a good idea 
to restrict what you’re searching for to a minimum of words that you’re 
fairly sure will cause a match. (Content searching is not case sensitive, 
though.) Content searching works only when you’ve generated an index, 
which I explain later in this section.
 
5. To include additional search criteria lines, click the button with the 
plus sign next to the last criterion line.
 
 You can limit your results based on all sorts of rules, including the date 
that the file or folder was last modified, when it was created, the file 
type, the size, the extension, or whether the file or folder is marked 
visible or hidden (such as a system file).
 
 You can also remove a search criterion line by clicking the button with 
the minus sign.
 
6. To save the search criteria that you selected, click Save.
 
 This creates a Smart Folder, which (you’re gonna love this) Snow 
Leopard automatically updates (in real time) to contain whatever items 
match the criteria you’ve saved! You can specify the location for your 
Smart Folder, and you can choose to add it to your Finder Sidebar for 
the ultimate convenience. Sweet.
 
7. When you’re done canvassing your computer, click the Back button in 
the Find dialog to return to the Finder.
Configuring the View Options
As I discuss at the beginning of the chapter, you have a lot of control over 
how Mac OS X presents files and folders in the Finder. In this section, I cover 
how you can make further adjustments to the view from your windows. 
(Pardon me for the ghastly cliché posing as a pun.)
Setting icon view options
First, allow me to provide a little detail on housekeeping in the Big X. After 
a few hours of work, a Finder window in icon mode can look something like 
a teenager’s room: stuff strewn all over the place, as I demonstrate with 
my Applications folder in Figure 1-9. To restore order to your Desktop, 
right-click (by tapping two fingers on the trackpad) in any open area of the 
active window and then choose Clean Up. This command leaves the icons in 
approximately the same position but snaps them to an invisible grid so that 
they’re aligned, as shown in Figure 1-10.

Figure 1-10:

After things are in alignment, work with the icon view options. (Naturally, 
you’ll want the active Finder window in icon view first, so choose View➪
As Icons or press Ô+1.) From the Finder menu, choose View➪Show View 
Options — or press that swingin’ Ô+J shortcut — to display the View Options 
dialog that you see in Figure 1-11. (Remember that these are the options 
available for icon view; I discuss the options for list, column, and Cover Flow 
view later in this chapter.)

Of course, Mac OS X remembers the changes that you make within the View 
Options dialog, no matter which view mode you’re configuring. Now, the 
changes that you can make from this dialog include
 
✦ Always Open in Icon View: When you select this check box, each Finder 
window that you open automatically uses icon view. (If deselected, the 
new window uses the last view mode you used.)
 
✦ Resizing your icons: Click and drag the Icon Size slider to shrink or 
expand the icons within the window. The icon size is displayed in pixels 
above the slider. (Remember, however, that Snow Leopard offers an 
icon resizing slider at the lower-right corner of any Finder window 
that’s currently using icon view mode; it’s much easier and more 
convenient just to drag the slider to expand or reduce the size of icons 
in a window.)
 
✦ Specifying grid spacing: Click and drag the Grid Spacing slider to shrink 
or expand the size of the grid used to align icons within the window. The 
larger the grid, the more white space between icons.
 
✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of 
the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon 
labels.
 
✦ Moving icon label text: Select either the Bottom (default) or the Right 
radio button to choose between displaying the text under your Desktop 
icons or to the right of the icons.

Configuring the View Options
 
✦ Show Item Info: With this check box selected, Mac OS X displays the 
number of items within each folder in the window. Many filenames also 
display helpful information (such as the dimensions of a photo).
 
✦ Show Icon Preview: If you select this check box, the Finder displays 
icons for image files using a miniature of the actual picture. (A cool 
feature for those with digital cameras; however, this does take extra 
processing time because Mac OS X has to load each image file and 
shrink it down to create the icon.)
 
✦ Arranging icons: From this pop-up menu, you can automatically align 
icons to a grid within the window, just as if you had used the Clean Up 
menu command. You can also sort the display of icons in a window by 
choosing one of the following criteria from its pop-up menu: by name, 
date modified, date created, size, item type, or the icon label you’ve 
assigned.
 
✦ Choosing a background: To select a background for the window, select 
one of three radio buttons here:
 
• White: This is the default.
 
• Color: Click a color choice from the color block that appears if you 
make this selection.
 
• Picture: Select this radio button and then click the Select button to 
display a standard Open dialog. Navigate to the location where the 
desired image is stored, click it once to select it, and then click Open.
 
✦ Use as Defaults: When you first open the View Options dialog, the 
changes you’re making apply only to the Finder window that opens 
when you open the selected item — in other words, the item that 
appears in the window’s title bar, such as a folder or drive.
 
 For example, any changes made to the settings in Figure 1-11 will affect 
only my Applications folder because it was the active Finder window 
when I pressed Ô+J. (You might have noticed that the window name 
also appears as the title of the View Options dialog.)
 
 However, you can decide to apply the changes that you make to all 
Finder windows that you view in your current mode. Click the Use as 
Defaults button to make a global change.
After all your changes are made and you’re ready to return to work, click the 
dialog’s Close button to save your settings.
Setting list view options
If you’re viewing the active window in list view, choose View➪Show View 
Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-12.

Figure 1-12: 
Here 
are your 
list view 
settings.
 
As in icon view, changes you make in this dialog normally apply only to this 
window, but you can click Use as Defaults to assign these settings to all 
windows that you view in list mode. The other list view settings include
 
✦ Always Open in List View: Select this check box and Snow Leopard will 
open all Finder windows in list view. (If deselected, new windows use 
the last view mode you used.)
 
✦ Resizing your icons: You can choose from two sizes of icons.
 
✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the up and down arrows to the right of 
the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the font size (in points) for icon 
labels.
 
✦ Show Columns: Select the check boxes under this heading to display 
additional columns in list view, including the date that the item was 
modified, the creation date, the size, the item type, the version (supplied 
by most applications), the label color, and any comments you’ve added 
in the Info dialog for that item. (In my personal opinion, the more columns 
you add, the more unwieldy the Finder gets, so I advise disabling the 
display of columns that you won’t use.)
 
✦ Use Relative Dates: Select this check box to display modification dates 
and creation dates with relative terms, such as Today or Yesterday. If 
this freaks you out, deselect this check box to force all dates to act like 
adults.

202
Configuring the View Options
 
✦ Calculate All Sizes: Select this check box to have Mac OS X display the 
actual sizes of folders, including all the files and subfolders they contain. 
(Handy for figuring out where all your disk space went, no?) Note: Using 
this option takes processing time, so I recommend that you avoid using 
it unless you really need to see the size.
 
✦ Show Icon Preview: Select this check box to display preview icons for 
image files. (Again, this takes extra processing time, and the image 
preview icons are pretty doggone small in list view, so this feature may 
be of limited value to you.)
To save your settings, click the dialog’s Close button.
Setting column view options
To make changes to view options in column view mode, choose View➪Show 
View Options to display the View Options dialog that you see in Figure 1-13.

You have only five column view options, and any changes that you make to 
this dialog are always reflected in every column view:
 
✦ Always Open in Column View: If this check box is selected, all Finder 
windows open in column view. (If deselected, new windows use the last 
view mode you used.)
 
✦ Resizing icon label text: Click the Text Size pop-up menu to choose the 
font size (in points) for icon labels.

Configuring the View Options
 
✦ Show Icons: Select this check box to display icons in the columns. If this 
option is deselected, the icons don’t appear and you’ll gain a little space.
 
✦ Show icon preview: Click this check box to select it, and Snow Leopard 
displays preview icons for image files — taking a little extra time to 
perform this service, naturally. (As you find out in the next bullet, 
column mode can be set to automatically display a preview thumbnail 
in the last column when you click an image or video file, and even some 
documents to boot . . . . Therefore, the usefulness of tiny icon previews 
in column mode may be limited for you.)
 
✦ Show Preview Column: If this check box is selected, clicking a file in 
column mode displays a thumbnail (reduced image) and preview 
information in the right-most column, as shown in Figure 1-14.
 
Figure 1-14: 
The Preview

 If you store a slew of smaller QuickTime movies and digital images on 
your drive, the Preview column is great. (You can even play a QuickTime 
movie from the Preview column.) Of course, longer movies and larger 
photos take more time to load!
 
✦ Arranging icons: Click this pop-up menu to specify the sort criteria for 
the item names displayed in each column, using name, date modified, 
date created, size, item type, or the icon label.
Click the dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

Setting Finder Preferences
Setting Cover Flow view options
The View options for Cover Flow view are the same as those for list view that 
I covered earlier in this section except forAlways Open in Cover Flow. You 
select this check box to open all new Finder windows in Cover Flow view. (If 
deselected, new windows use the last view mode you used.)
Setting Finder Preferences
Finally, you can change a number of settings to customize the Finder itself. 
From the Finder menu, click Finder and choose the Preferences menu item 
to display the Finder Preferences dialog that you see in Figure 1-15.
 
Figure 1-15: 
You can 
configure 
your Finder 
preferences 
here.
 
In the General section, the preference settings include
 
✦ Displaying Icons on the Desktop: Select these check boxes to display 
your hard disks, removable volumes (including CDs, DVDs, and iPods), 
and connected network servers.
 
✦ New Finder Windows Open: Click the pop-up menu to specify the spot 
where a new Finder window should open. By default, a new window 
displays the contents of your Home folder.
 
✦ Always Open Folders in a New Window: When this check box is 
selected, double-clicking a folder will open it in a new Finder window, as 
did earlier versions of Mac OS. (If deselected, the contents of the folder 
appear in the same Finder window, which makes it easier to focus on 
just the folder you need at the moment.)

Book III

205
Setting Finder Preferences
 
✦ Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: It sounds a little wacky, but 
using this feature can definitely speed up file copying! If this check box 
is selected, you can drag an item on top of a folder — without releasing 
the trackpad — and after a preset time (controlled by the Delay slider), 
a spring-loaded window appears to show you the folder’s contents. At 
that point, you can either lift your finger from the trackpad to drop the 
file inside the folder (upon which the window disappears), or you can 
drag the icon on top of another subfolder to spring it forth and drill even 
deeper.
The Labels preference pane is a simple one — just click next to each label 
color to type your own text for that label. (I’ve gotta recommend red for 
deadlines and green for contracts . . . call me sentimental.)
 
From the Sidebar preferences pane, you can choose which default items 
should appear in the Finder window Sidebar column. Your choices include 
locations (such as your Home and Applications folders), network servers, 
removable media, the Desktop itself, and — naturally — your hard drives. To 
add a default item to the Sidebar column, click the corresponding check box 
to select it, or deselect the check box to banish that item forthwith.
The Advanced preference settings include
 
✦ Show All File Extensions: If this check box is selected, the Finder displays 
the file extensions at the end of filenames. This comes in handy for some 
applications, where everything from a document to a preference file to 
the application itself all share the same icon. However, I find extensions 
distasteful and leave things set with the default of extensions off.
 
✦ Show Warning before Changing an Extension: Also on by default, this 
setting forces Snow Leopard to display a confirmation dialog before 
allowing you to change the extension on a filename. Why? Well, changing 
an extension usually results in a “broken” file association, so the file’s 
corresponding application may not launch automatically any longer 
when you double-click the item. Double-clicking a Word document, for 
example, might not launch Word automatically as it used to do. If you 
show file extensions and you often change them, click this check box to 
disable the warning.
 
✦ Show Warning before Emptying the Trash: By default, this check box 
is selected, and Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog before allowing 
you to — in the words of Mac OS X patrons around the world — toss the 
Bit Bucket. If you’re interested in speed and trust your judgment (and 
your trackpad finger), you can disable this setting.
 
✦ Empty Trash Securely: If you’d prefer to use the more secure method of 
emptying your Trash — where deleted items are far harder for anyone 
to recover — select this check box.

206
Setting Finder Preferences
 
✦ When Performing a Search: Click this pop-up menu to specify whether 
the text you enter in the Finder window Search box should match 
everything on your Mac or be limited to the current folder only. Choose 
Use the Previous Search Scope to use the scope setting you used during 
your last search.
After you make the desired changes to the Finder Preferences, click the 
dialog’s Close button to save your settings and return to the Finder.

Chapter 2: Giving Your Desktop 
the Personal Touch
In This Chapter
✓ Picking your own background
✓ Adding and selecting a screen saver
✓ Choosing menu colors and highlights
✓ Keeping track of things with Stickies
✓ Customizing the Dock and using Dashboard
✓ Cleaning and sorting the Mac OS X Desktop
“T
weak! Tweak!” It’s not the cry of some exotic bird — that’s the call 
of the wild MacBook Power User. Power users like to tweak their 
Mac OS X Desktops just so, with that menu color, this background, and 
those applications in the Dock. Noncomputer types just can’t understand 
the importance of the proper arrangement of your virtual workplace: When 
things are familiar and customized to your needs, you’re more productive, 
and things get done faster. In fact, if you’ve set up multiple users on your 
computer under Mac OS X, the Big X automatically keeps track of each 
user’s Desktop and restores it when that person logs in. (For example, when 
you use the MacBook, you get that background photo of Suzanne Sommers 
from the ’70s whereas your daughter gets Avril Lavigne.)
In this chapter, I show you what you can do to produce a Desktop that’s 
uniquely your own, including tweaks that you can make to the background 
and your Desktop icons. I also show you how to use Desktop Stickies 
instead of a forest of paper slips covering your monitor.
With your Mac OS X Desktop clad in the proper harmonious colors — yes, 
that can be your favorite photo of Elvis himself — and your new Dock icons 
ready for action, you’re indeed prepared for whatever lies ahead in your 
computing world!
Changing the Background
You might be asking, “Mark, do I really need a custom background?” That 
depends completely on your personal tastes, but I’ve yet to meet a computer 
owner who didn’t change his or her background when presented with the 
opportunity. Favorite backgrounds usually include

208
Changing the Background
 
✦ Humorous cartoons and photos that can bring a smile to your face (even 
during the worst workday)
 
✦ Scenic beauty
 
✦ Photos of family and friends (or the latest Hollywood heartthrob)
 
✦ The company logo (not sure it does much for morale, but it does 
impress the boss)
If you do decide to spruce up your background, you have three choices: You 
can select one of the default Mac OS X background images, choose a solid 
color, or specify your own image. All three backgrounds are chosen from 
the Desktop & Screen Saver pane, located within System Preferences (as 
illustrated in Figure 2-1).
 
Figure 2-1: 
To select a 
background, 
get thee 
hence to 
System 
Preferences.
 
Picking something Apple
To choose a background from one of the collections provided by Apple, 
click one of these groups from the list at the left:
 
✦ Desktop Pictures: These default backgrounds range from simple 
patterns to somewhat strange and ethereal flux shapes. (You have to 
see them to understand what I mean.)
 
✦ Nature: These backgrounds feature scenic beauty, such as blades of 
grass, sand dunes, snowy hills . . . that sort of thing.
 
✦ Plants: Close-up backgrounds of plant life — I especially recommend the 
autumn leaves.

Book III
Chapter 2
Giving Your Desktop 
the Personal Touch
209
Changing the Background
 
✦ Black & White: Several truly stunning black-and-white backgrounds that 
look especially good on a widescreen display. These are my favorite 
images provided by Apple.
 
✦ Abstract: These backgrounds have even weirder twisting shapes in flux, 
this time with bright contrasting colors. Good for a psychiatrist’s office.
 
✦ Solid Colors: This is for those who desire a soothing solid shade. More 
on this in the following section.
 
✦ Pictures Folder: This displays the images saved in the active user’s 
Pictures folder.
 
✦ Choose Folder: You can open a folder containing images and display 
them instead. (I discuss this in more detail in a page or two.)
If you see something you like, click the thumbnail, and Mac OS X displays 
it in the well and automatically refreshes your background so that you can 
see what it looks like. (By the way, in the Apple universe, a well is a sunken 
square area that displays an image or color swatch — in this case, the 
background image that you select.)
 
Notice your iPhoto albums in the list? That’s no accident — Snow Leopard 
automatically offers your iPhoto Photo Library so that you can choose 
images from your iPhoto collection!
Mac OS X automatically manipulates how the background appears on your 
Desktop. If an image conforms to your screen resolution, fine — otherwise, 
click the pop-up menu next to the well and you can choose to
 
✦ Tile the background. This repeats the image to cover the Desktop. 
(This is usually done with pattern images to produce a smooth, creamy, 
seamless look.)
 
✦ Fill the screen. This can be used with a solid color to get uniform 
coverage. The original aspect ratio of the image is preserved, so it’s not 
stretched.
 
✦ Stretch the background to fit the Desktop. If your Desktop image is 
smaller than the Desktop acreage, this works, but be warned — if you try 
to stretch too small an image over too large a Desktop, the pixilated result 
can be pretty frightening. (Think of enlarging an old Kodak Instamatic 
negative to a 16 x 20 poster. Dots, dots, dots.) The original aspect ratio 
of the image isn’t preserved, so you might end up with results that look 
like the funhouse mirrors at a carnival.
 
✦ Center the image on the Desktop. This is my favorite solution for 
Desktop images that are smaller than your resolution.

210
Changing the Background
Note that this pop-up menu appears only if the Desktop picture that you 
select isn’t one of the standard Apple images. All the pictures in the Apple 
Desktop Pictures, Nature, Abstract, and Solid Colors categories are scaled 
automatically to the size of your screen.
 
To change your Desktop background automatically on a regular basis, select 
the Change Picture check box and then choose the delay period from the 
corresponding pop-up menu. To display the images in random order, select 
the Random Order check box; otherwise, Mac OS X displays them in the 
order that they appear in the folder. You can also select a translucent Finder 
menu bar, which (almost) blends in with your background. If you prefer a 
solid-color, matter-of-fact workman’s menu bar, click the Translucent Menu 
Bar check box to deselect it.
I just gotta have lavender
As I mention earlier, for those who want their favorite color without the 
distraction of an image, you can choose from a selection of solid colors. 
You can choose from these colors the same way that you’d pick a default 
Mac OS X background image (as I describe in the preceding section).
Selecting your own photo
Finally, you can drag your own image into the well from a Finder window to 
add your own work of art. To view thumbnails of an entire folder, click the 
Pictures Folder (to display the contents of your personal Pictures folder) 
or click the Add button (bearing the plus sign) to specify any folder on your 
system. Click the desired thumbnail to embellish your Desktop.
Never let it be said that I can’t dish out revenge 
when necessary. I don’t know whether I should 
call this a Tip or a Devilish Practical Joke That 
Will Drive People Nuts — anyway, it’s fun as all 
get-out. Right before you go to lunch, use the 
Grab utility in your Applications/Utilities folder to 
take a snapshot of your Desktop with a number 
of windows open (or an error dialog with an OK 
or a Close button) and then save the image to 
your Pictures folder. Select the image as your 
Desktop background and then watch others 
go crazy trying to click those faux windows, 
buttons, and icons. For an archenemy, 
try the same trick on his Mac! Arrange a 
slightly embarrassing Desktop on his computer, 
specify it as the background, and sit back while 
the fun begins. (Perhaps a Web browser that’s 
open to a somewhat unusual Web site?)

Changing the Screen Saver
Changing the Screen Saver
Screen savers are another popular item. Because I cover the Screen Saver 
preferences in Chapter 3 of this minibook, I simply illustrate here how to 
choose one. Open System Preferences and click the Desktop & Screen Saver 
icon; then click the Screen Saver tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2: 
A good 
screen 
saver can

effects of a 
bad boss.
 
 
To add a third-party screen saver module so that everyone can use it on a 
multiuser system, copy it into the Screen Savers folder within the top-level 
Library folder. To selfishly keep that saver all to yourself, copy it into your 
user account’s Screen Savers folder (which is located within the Library 
folder in your Home folder).
Click one of the entries in the Screen Savers column to display a thumbnail 
of the effect. Selecting the Use Random Screen Saver check box runs through 
’em all, naturally. You can also test the appearance of the saver module by 
clicking the Test button; the screen saver runs until you move the mouse or 
press a key.
To keep tabs on the current time, click the Show with Clock check box to 
select it. Snow Leopard adds a clock display to any screen saver.
Many screen savers allow you to monkey with their settings. If the Options 
button is enabled (not grayed out), click it to see how you can change the 
effects.

I can’t understand it, but some people just don’t appreciate menus with 
purple highlights! (You can tell a Louisiana State University graduate a mile

these steps:
 
1. Open System Preferences and click the Appearance icon to display 
the settings, as shown in Figure 2-3.

that appears when you select text in an application or select an item 
from a list.
 
4. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.
Adding Stickies
Stickies are interesting little beasts — I don’t know their genus or phyla, 
but they’re certainly handy to have around. To be technical for a moment, 
a Sticky is actually nothing more than a special type of application window, 
but these windows remain on your Desktop as long as the Stickies 
application is running.

Book III
Chapter 2
Giving Your Desktop 
the Personal Touch
213
Adding Stickies
I use Stickies for anything that a real-world sticky note can handle, including
 
✦ Reminders that you don’t want to misplace
 
✦ Snippets of text that you want to temporarily store while your MacBook 
is turned off (without launching a behemoth like Word or digging for 
TextEdit)
 
✦ Boilerplate (repeated and standard) text that you’re constantly including 
in your documents, such as your address
 
✦ A quick note that includes someone’s e-mail address or phone number
 
✦ Today’s Dilbert cartoon from www.dilbert.com
A Sticky can contain data pasted from the Clipboard, or you can simply type 
directly into the Stickies application window. Sticky windows can include 
graphics and different fonts and colors. You can even locate specific text 
from somewhere in your vast collection of Stickies by using the Find command 
within the Stickies application. Just press Ô+F while the Stickies menu is 
active to display the Stickies Find dialog. (And you don’t use up our 
bark-covered friends of the forest, either.)
 
In Book II, I discuss the Mac OS X Services menu. You can make a Sticky note 
from the Services menu in many applications as well.
Follow these steps to stick your way to success:
 
1. Open your Applications folder and run the Stickies application to 
display the new window that you see in Figure 2-4.
 
 The text cursor is already idling in the new window.
 
2. Type text in the window or press Ô+V to paste the contents of the 
Clipboard into the window.
 
 You can also import the contents of an existing file into a Sticky. Just 
click File and then choose Import Text to display a standard Open 
dialog.
 
3. (Optional) Add text formatting, change text font, and change font 
color from the Font menu.
 
 From the Note menu, you can also choose to make the Sticky translucent. 
(No pressing reason; they just look cool.)
 
4. To change the Sticky color, click the Color menu and choose the 
appropriate hue.
 
5. Resize and drag the Sticky window to the desired location.
 
 Press Ô+M to toggle between a miniaturized view (showing only the title 
bar) and the expanded view.

214
Customizing the Dock
 
Figure 2-4: 
“Look, 
Ma, it’s a 
Sticky!”
 
 
To automatically run the Stickies application each time you log on, open the 
Accounts settings in System Preferences and click your account in the list. 
Click the Login Items button and add Stickies to the list by clicking the plus 
button.
To delete a Sticky, simply click the Close button at the upper-left corner of 
the Sticky window. Or click the Sticky to make it the active note and then 
click Close. Stickies displays a dialog to confirm that you want to close the 
note; click Save to save the contents in a file or click the Don’t Save button to 
close the note and discard its contents.
To close the Stickies application completely, click any note and press Ô+Q. 
The application remembers the position and contents of each note for when 
you launch it again.
Customizing the Dock
In terms of importance, the Dock — the launch pad for applications and 
documents that appears on your Desktop — ranks right up there with the 
command center of a modern nuclear submarine. As such, it had better be 
easy to customize, and naturally, Mac OS X doesn’t let you down.

Book III

215
Customizing the Dock
Adding applications and extras to the Dock
Why be satisfied with just the icons that Apple places in the Dock? You can 
add your own applications, files, and folders to the Dock as well.
 
✦ Adding applications: You can add any application to your Dock by 
simply dragging its icon into the area to the left side of the Dock (that’s 
to the left side of the vertical dotted line that’s visible in the Dock). 
You’ll know when you’re in the proper territory because the existing 
Dock icons obligingly move aside to make a space for it.
 
 Attempting to place an application directly on the right side of the Dock 
sends it to the Trash (if the Trash icon is highlighted when you release 
the button), so beware. Note, however, that you can drop an application 
icon inside a Stack or a folder that already exists at the right side of the 
Dock.
  
 
Snow Leopard adds a new Exposé feature to the Dock: With Exposé 
active, click the Dock icon for any open application, and Exposé 
displays all the application’s windows, allowing you to change to 
another window. Just click the Exposé window you want to work 
with. . . Convenience is King in Cupertino!
 
✦ Adding individual files and volumes: Individual files and volume icons 
can be added to the Dock by dragging the icon into the area to the right 
side of the Dock. (Attempting to place these to the left of the side of 
the Dock opens an application with the contents, which usually doesn’t 
work.) Again, the existing Dock icons will move aside to create a space 
when you’re in the right area.
 
 To open the Dock item you’ve added in a Finder window, right-click the 
icon to display a Dock menu, where you can open documents, run 
applications, and have other assorted fun, depending on the item you 
choose.
 
✦ Adding several files or a folder: Snow Leopard uses a feature called 
Stacks, which I discuss in a few paragraphs, to handle multiple files or 
add an entire folder to the Dock.
 
✦ Adding Web sites: You can drag any URL from Safari directly into the 
area at the right of the Dock. Clicking that icon automatically opens your 
browser and displays that page. (Safari gets the treatment in Book VI, 
Chapter 5.) Now that, my friends, is genuine sassy!
To remove an icon from the Dock, just click and drag it off the Dock. You get 
a rather silly (but somehow, strangely satisfying) animated cloud of debris, 
and the icon is no more. Note, however, that the original application, folder, 
or volume is not deleted — just the Dock icon itself is permanently excused. If 
you like, you can delete almost any of the default icons that Mac OS X installs 
in the Dock; only the Finder and Trash icons must remain in the Dock.

216
Customizing the Dock
To set up a Dock icon as a Login Item — without the hassle of opening the 
Accounts pane in System Preferences — just click a Dock icon and hold the 
mouse button down until the pop-up menu appears. Then select the Open at 
Login menu item.
 
If you can’t delete items from the Dock, you’re using a managed account — 
your account is configured with Parental Controls turned on, and your 
administrator has deselected the Can Modify the Dock check box in your 
account. In order to delete Dock items, you’ll need an admin-level user to log 
in; then visit the Accounts pane in System Preferences and select the check 
box again. For more information on user accounts, see Chapter 5 of this 
minibook.
Keeping track(s) with Stacks
I know, it’s a horrible play on words, but my editors are doing me a favor.
Snow Leopard offers Stacks, which are groups of items (documents, applica-
tions, and folders) that you want to place in the Dock for convenience — 
perhaps the files needed for a project you’re working on, or your favorite 
game applications. For example, I have a Stack named Wiley on my Dock that 
holds all the project files I need for the book I’m currently writing.
To create a Stack, just select and drag the items you want to include to the 
right side of the Dock. As always, the Dock opens a spot on the right side of 
the Dock to indicate you’re in the zone.
To display the items in a Stack, just click it:
 
✦ If the Stack holds relatively few items, they’re displayed in a really 
cool-looking arc that Apple calls a fan (as shown in Figure 2-5), and you 
can click the item you want to open or launch.
 
✦ If the Stack is stuffed full of many items, the Stack opens in a grid 
display, allowing you to scroll through the contents (and even open 
subfolders inside the Stack) to find what you need.
You can remove a Stack from the Dock by Control-clicking or right-clicking 
the Stack icon. To do so, choose Remove from Dock from the menu that 
appears. Alternatively, just drag that sucker right off the Dock.

Customizing the Dock
 
Figure 2-5: 
Click a 
Stack in 
the Dock 
to view its 
contents.
 
 
If you add a folder full of items, the Stack is named after the folder; otherwise, 
Snow Leopard does the best job it can in figuring out what to name the 
Stack. (Although Apple makes a righteous attempt, I usually end up renaming 
the Stack. Right-click the Stack icon, or hold down Control while clicking the 
icon, and you’ll see the Rename Stack menu item appear.)
Apple provides two Stacks already set up for you. One, the Download folder, 
situated next to the Trash, is the default location for any new files that 
you download using Safari or receive in your e-mail. Snow Leopard bounces 
the Download Stack icon to indicate that you’ve received a new item. 
Next to the Download Stack is the Documents Stack, which conveniently 
displays the contents of your Documents folder.
Resizing the Dock
You can change the size of the Dock from the Dock settings in System 
Preferences — I explain this in more detail in Book III, Chapter 3 — but 
here’s a simpler way to resize the Dock, right from the Desktop.
Move your cursor over the vertical dotted line that separates the left side of 
the Dock from the right side; the cursor turns into a funky line with arrows 
pointing up and down. This is your cue to click and drag while moving your 
finger up and down on the trackpad, which expands and shrinks the Dock, 
respectively.

218
Stick It on the Dashboard
You can also right-click when the funky line cursor is visible to display a 
menu of Dock preferences. This allows you to change your Dock preferences 
without the hassle of opening System Preferences and displaying the Dock 
settings.
Stick It on the Dashboard
One of Snow Leopard’s most popular features is Dashboard, which you can 
use to hold widgets and display them with the press of a button. (Okay, I 
know that sounds a little wacky, but bear with me.) Widgets are small 
applications — dubbed applets — that typically provide only one function. 
For example, Dashboard comes complete with a calculator, a clock, a 
weather display, and a quick-and-simple calendar. You can display and 
use these widgets at any time by pressing the Dashboard key; by default, 
that’s F4 on current MacBook keyboards, but you can modify the key on 
the Exposé & Spaces pane within System Preferences. Snow Leopard also 
includes a thoughtful Dashboard icon in the Dock, which you can click to 
display your widgets. (Geez, that sounds kind of racy. Best not to pursue it.)
Figure 2-6 illustrates Dashboard in action. Press the Dashboard key, and 
the widgets appear, ready for you to use. You can add widgets to or delete 
them from your Dashboard by clicking the Add button (which bears a plus 
sign, naturally) at the lower-left corner of the Dashboard screen. When 
you click the Add button, a scrolling menu strip appears at the bottom of 
the Dashboard display, and you can drag new widgets directly onto your 
Dashboard from this menu. It’s also easy to rearrange the widgets that are 
already populating Dashboard by dragging them to the desired spot. Press 
the Dashboard key again to return to your Snow Leopard Desktop.
Most widgets have an option button that allows you to change things, such 
as borders, ZIP Codes, display columns, and the like; look for a tiny circle 
with a lowercase letter i. Click this information icon and you can tweak 
whatever options are available for that widget.
To remove a widget, just click the Add button to display the menu strip, and 
you’ll notice a tiny X button appears next to each widget on your Dashboard. 
Click the X button next to the widget you want to remove, and it vanishes 
from the display. You can add it back again at any time from the strip.
 
While you’re adding or deleting widgets, you can also click Manage Widgets, 
which displays a dialog where you can sort your widgets in a list by name or 
date added, disable any widget, and delete a widget (click the red minus icon 
next to the offending widget in the list). Click the More Widgets button to 
jump directly to the widget download area on the Apple Web site.

Figure 2-6: 
Dashboard 
proudly 
displays its 
widgets.
 
If you need to use a widget for only a second or two, press the Dashboard 
key and hold it. When you release the key, you’re back to your Desktop.
Apple offers additional widgets that you can download on the Mac OS X 
download site (www.apple.com/macosx). Third-party software developers 
also provide both freeware and shareware widgets.
 
You can also modify the Dashboard key by turning it into a key sequence, 
which is a good thing if you’re already using an application that thrives on 
F4. Visit the Exposé & Spaces pane in System Preferences, and use the Shift, 
Control, Option, and Ô keys in conjunction with the Dashboard key to specify 
a modifier.
Oh, did I mention that Snow Leopard allows you to create your own 
Dashboard widgets? That’s right, this feature is sure to be a winner amongst 
the In Crowd. Follow these steps to create a new WebClip Dashboard widget 
from your favorite Web site:
 
1. Run Safari and navigate to the site you want to view as a widget.
 
2. Click File➪Open in Dashboard.

220
Arranging Your Precious Desktop
 
3. Select the portion of the page you want to include in your widget and 
click Add.
 
 Many Web pages use frames to organize and separate sections of a page, 
so this step allows you to choose the frame with the desired content.
 
4. Drag the handles at the edges of the selection border to resize your 
widget frame to the right size and then click Add.
 
 Bam! Snow Leopard displays your new WebClip widget within 
Dashboard.
A WebClip widget can include text, graphics, and links, which Dashboard 
updates every time you display your widgets. Think about that for a second: 
Dynamic displays, such as weather maps, cartoons, even the Free Music 
Download image from the iTunes Store, are all good sources of WebClip 
widgets! (That last one is a real timesaver.)
If you click a link in a WebClip widget, Dashboard loads the full Web page in 
Safari, so you can even use WebClips for surfing chores with sites you visit 
often.
Arranging Your Precious Desktop
Consider the layout of the Desktop itself. You can set the options for icon 
placement from the Finder View menu. Just as you can with the options for 
Finder windows that I cover in Chapter 1 of this minibook, you can clean up 
and arrange your Desktop by name, date, size, or kind.
The View Options for the Desktop are different in two ways from the View 
Options for a Finder window in icon view (which I discuss in Chapter 1 of 
this minibook):
 
✦ You choose a background for the Finder from System Preferences.
 
✦ There’s no Always Open check box. Your Desktop always opens in Icon 
view!

Chapter 3: Delving under the 
Hood with System Preferences
In This Chapter
✓ Displaying and customizing settings in System Preferences
✓ Saving your changes
✓ Changing settings
T
he System Preferences window is the place to practice behavior 
modification in Mac OS X. The settings that you specify in System 
Preferences affect the majority of the applications that you use as well as 
the hardware that you connect to your MacBook; your Internet and network 
traffic; the appearance and activity on your Desktop; and how Snow 
Leopard handles money, dates, and languages. Oh, and don’t forget your 
screen saver — important stuff!
In this chapter, I discuss the many settings in System Preferences. You 
discover what does what and how you can customize the appearance and 
operation of Mac OS X.
The Preferred Way to Display the Preferences
Apple has made it easy to open the System Preferences window. Just click 
the System Preferences icon (which looks like a number of gears) in the Dock, 
and the window shown in Figure 3-1 appears. You can also open the window 
by clicking the Apple menu and choosing the System Preferences item.
 
To display all the System Preferences icons at any time, click the Show All 
button. You can also use the Back and Forward buttons (in the toolbar’s 
upper-left corner) to move backward and forward through the different 
panes you’ve accessed in System Preferences, just as you use the similar 
buttons in a Web browser (yes, just like Safari!).

222
Saving Your Preferences
 
Figure 3-1: 
The System 
Preferences 
window is a 
familiar face 
to any Snow 
Leopard 
user.
 
Although the System Preferences panes are arranged by category when you 
first install Snow Leopard, you can also display the panes in alphabetical 
order — making it easier to choose a pane if you’re unsure what group it’s 
in. To do so, choose View➪Organize Alphabetically. (Note that you can also 
select any pane directly from the View menu.)
 
In fact, you can right-click the System Preferences icon in the Dock to jump 
to any pane from the contextual menu. Wowzers!
Saving Your Preferences
Note that the System Preferences window has no Save or Apply button. 
Illustrating the elegant design of Mac OS X, simply quitting System 
Preferences automatically saves all the changes that you make. (However, 
some panes in System Preferences have an Apply button that you can click 
to apply your changes immediately.) As with any other Mac OS X application, 
you can quit the System Preferences window by pressing Ô+Q or by 
choosing System Preferences➪Quit System Preferences.
Some third-party applications can actually 
install their own groups within your once-
pristine System Preferences window. Naturally, 
I can’t document these invited guests in this 
chapter, but they work the same way as any 
other group within System Preferences. Click 
the icon, adjust any settings as necessary, and 
then close the System Preferences window to 
save your changes.
 Hey, I got bonus icons in my window!

Searching for Specific Settings
Searching for a single button or check box amidst all the settings in System 
Preferences might seem like hunting for the proverbial needle in a haystack, 
but your friends at Apple have added a Search box to the right side of the 
window toolbar. Click in this Search box (or press Ô+F) and type the setting 
name, like screen saver (or even a word that’s generally associated with a 
setting, like power for the Energy Saver settings). Snow Leopard highlights 
all the icons in System Preferences that have anything to do with the search 
keywords you entered, as shown in Figure 3-2. You don’t even have to press 
Return!
 
Figure 3-2:

the panes 
that contain 
your search 
keywords.
 
To reset the Search field for a different keyword, click the X button that 
appears at the right of the Search box.
Getting Personal
The first stop on your tour of the System Preferences window is the Personal 
section. No singles ads here — this section is devoted to settings that you 
make to customize the appearance and operation of your Desktop and login 
account.
Appearance preferences
The Appearance group appears in Figure 3-3.

224
Getting Personal
 
Figure 3-3: 
The 
Appearance 
pane.
 
These settings are
 
✦ Appearance: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used for 
buttons, menus, and windows.
 
✦ Highlight Color: From this pop-up menu, choose a color to be used to 
highlight selected text in fields and pop-up menus.
 
✦ Place Scroll Arrows: Select either radio button here to put the scroll 
bar arrow buttons together (at the bottom of the scroll bar, in the 
lower-right corner of the window) or at the top and bottom of the 
scroll bar.
 
✦ Click in the Scroll Bar To: By default, Mac OS X jumps to the next or 
previous page when you click in an empty portion of the scroll bar. 
Select the Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked radio button to scroll the 
document to the approximate position in relation to where you click. 
(You can also choose smooth scrolling, which looks cool, but many folks 
think that it’s too slow compared with the default scrolling speed.) If you 
select the Double-Click a Window’s Title Bar to Minimize check box, you 
can minimize a Finder or application window by simply double-clicking 
the window’s title bar.
 
✦ Number of Recent Items: The default number of recent applications, 
documents, and servers (available from the Recent Items item in the 
Apple menu, which you can read more about in Book II, Chapter 3) is 10. 
To change the default, click any of the pop-up menus here and choose 
up to 50. (Personally, I like 20 or 30 for each.)
 
✦ Use LCD Font Smoothing: By default, this check box is enabled, making 
the text on your MacBook’s LCD display appear more like the printed 
page.

Book III
Chapter 3
Delving under the 
Hood with System

Getting Personal
 
✦ Turn Off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes: Below a certain point size, text 
smoothing isn’t much good for most on-screen fonts. By default, any font 
displayed at 8 point or smaller isn’t smoothed, which is suitable for a 
high-end video card and monitor. You can speed up the display of text 
by turning off text smoothing for fonts up to 12 point.
Desktop and screen saver preferences
Figure 3-4 illustrates the settings in the Desktop & Screen Saver group.
 
Figure 3-4: 
The Desktop 
& Screen 
Saver pane.
 
The settings on the Desktop tab are
 
✦ Current Desktop Picture: You can click a picture in the thumbnail list 
at the right half of the screen to use it as your Desktop background. The 
Desktop is immediately updated, and the thumbnail appears in the well 
(the square box in Figure 3-4). To display a different image collection 
or open a folder of your own images, click the Add Folder button at the 
lower left of the window (which carries a plus sign) and browse for your 
heart’s desire; click Choose to select a folder and display the images it 
contains.
 
✦ Layout: As I explain in Chapter 2 of this minibook, you can tile your 
background image, center it, fill the screen with it, and stretch it to fill 
the screen. (Note that filling the screen may distort the image.) The 
layout control appears only when you’re using your own pictures, so 
you won’t see it if you’re using a Desktop image supplied by Apple.

226
Getting Personal
 
✦ Change Picture: Select this check box to change the Desktop background 
automatically after the delay period that you set, including each time 
you log in and each time your Mac wakes up from sleep mode.
 
✦ Random Order: To display screens randomly, enable the Random Order 
check box. Otherwise, the backgrounds are displayed in the sequence in 
which they appear in the thumbnail strip.
 
✦ Translucent Menu Bar: When enabled, this feature turns your Finder 
and application menu bars semi-opaque, allowing them to blend in 
somewhat with your Desktop background. If you’d rather have a 
solid-color menu bar, deselect this check box.
Click the Screen Saver tab to see the following settings:
 
✦ Screen Savers: In the Screen Savers list at the left, click the screen saver 
that you want to display an animated Preview of on the right. To try out 
the screen saver in full-screen mode, click the Test button. (You can end 
the test by moving your finger across the trackpad.) If the screen saver 
module that you select has any configurable settings, click the Options 
button to display them. (A screen saver is configurable if the Options 
button is enabled.)
 
✦ Start Screen Saver: Click and drag the slider here to specify the period 
of inactivity that triggers the screen saver. To disable the screen saver, 
choose the Never setting at the far right of the slider.
 
✦ Use Random Screen Saver: Just what it says: If this check box is 
enabled, a different screen saver module is used each time the screen 
saver is activated.
 
✦ Show with Clock: If you want your selected screen saver to display the 
time as well, click this check box to enable it.
 
✦ Hot Corners: Click any of the four pop-up menus at the four corners 
of the screen to specify that corner as an activation hot corner (which 
immediately activates the screen saver) or as a disabling hot corner 
(which prevents the screen saver from activating). As long as the 
pointer stays in the disabling hot corner, the screen saver doesn’t kick 
in no matter how long a period of inactivity passes. Note that you can 
also set the Exposé activation corners from here. (For the scoop on 
Exposé, see the upcoming section, “Exposé and Spaces preferences.”)
Dock preferences
The Dock group is shown in Figure 3-5.

Book III
Chapter 3
Delving under the 
Hood with System 
Preferences
227
Getting Personal
 
Figure 3-5: 
The Dock 
preference 
pane.
 
Settings here are
 
✦ Size: Move this slider to change the overall size of the Dock.
 
✦ Magnification: With this check box selected, a Dock icon magically 
expands, like the national deficit, when you move your pointer over it. 
You can move the Magnification slider to specify just how much 
magnification is right for you.
 
 This feature is useful for helping you click a particular Dock icon if 
you’ve resized the Dock smaller than its default dimensions or if you 
have a large number of items in the Dock.
 
✦ Position on Screen: Choose from three radio buttons to make that crazy 
Dock appear at the left, bottom, or right edge of your Desktop.
 
✦ Minimize Windows Using: By default, Mac OS X animates a window 
when it’s shrunk into the Dock (and when it’s expanded back into a full 
window). From the Minimize Using pop-up menu, you can choose from 
a genie-in-a-bottle effect or a scale-up-or-down-incrementally effect. 
To demonstrate, choose an effect and then click the Minimize button 
(the yellow button in the upper-left corner) on the System Preferences 
window.
 
✦ Minimize windows into application icon: By default, Snow Leopard 
minimizes a window as a thumbnail on the right side of the Dock. 
Select this check box to minimize a window into the icon for the parent 
application instead.
 
✦ Animate Opening Applications: By default, Mac OS X has that happy, 
slam-dancing feeling when you launch an application: The application’s 
icon bounces up and down in the Dock two or three times to draw your 
attention and indicate that the application is loading. If you find this 
effervescence overly buoyant or distracting, deselect this check box.

228
Getting Personal
 
✦ Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: If you like, the Dock can stay 
hidden until you need it, thus reclaiming a significant amount of Desktop 
space for your application windows. Select this check box to hide the 
Dock whenever you’re not using it.
 
 To display a hidden Dock, move your pointer over the edge of the 
Desktop where it’s hiding.
 
You can also change these Dock preference settings from the Apple menu.
Exposé and Spaces preferences
Figure 3-6 illustrates the Exposé & Spaces settings that you can configure 
in this group. You can use Exposé to view all the application windows that 
you’re using at one time so that you can select a new active window. Or you 
can move all windows aside so that you can see your Desktop. Dashboard 
presents a number of mini-applications (or widgets), which you can summon 
and hide with a single key. Spaces makes it easy to create multiple desktops 
that you can switch between, each of which has its own set of preloaded 
applications.
 
Figure 3-6: 
Set your 
Dashboard 
and Exposé 
preferences

Book III
Chapter 3
Delving under the 
Hood with System

229
Getting Personal
On the Exposé pane, the settings are
 
✦ Active Screen Corners: These four pop-up menus operate just like the 
Hot Corners/Active Screen Corners in the Desktop & Screen Savers 
pane, but they control the operation of the Snow Leopard Dashboard 
and Exposé features. Click one to specify that corner as an All Windows 
corner (which displays all windows on your Desktop), an Application 
Windows corner (which displays only the windows from the active 
application), a Desktop corner (which moves all windows to the outside 
of the screen to uncover your Desktop), or a Dashboard corner (which 
displays your Dashboard widgets). Note that you can also set the Screen 
Saver Start and Disable corners from here.
 
✦ Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Exposé functions as 
well as the Dashboard.
 
 You’re not limited to just the keyboard and mouse shortcuts on the 
pop-up menus — press the Shift, Control, Option, and Ô keys while 
a pop-up menu is open, and you see these modifiers appear as menu 
choices! (Heck, you can even combine modifiers, such as Ô+Shift+F9 
instead of just F9.)
On the Spaces pane (as shown in Figure 3-7), you find the following settings:
 
Figure 3-7:

Spaces 
pane.
 

230
Getting Personal
 
✦ Enable Spaces: In order to use Spaces, select this check box.
 
✦ Show Spaces in Menu Bar: When this check box is selected, Snow 
Leopard displays the Spaces desktop number you’re currently using 
in the Finder menu bar. You can click the number in the menu bar to 
switch to another Spaces desktop or to open the Spaces Preferences 
pane.
 
✦ Rows buttons: To add a row of Spaces desktops to the Spaces grid, 
click the Add button with the plus sign. (By default, Spaces starts 
with two desktops enabled, so new rows and columns are numbered 
beginning with three.) To delete a row, click the Delete button (which 
bears a minus sign).
 
✦ Columns buttons: To add a column of Spaces desktops to the Spaces 
grid, click the Add (plus) button. Click the Delete (minus) button to 
remove a column from the grid.
 
 If you choose to remove a column or row, Snow Leopard alerts you that 
the bindings on the deleted desktop(s) will be reassigned.
 
✦ Add/Remove Application: Click the Add Application button (the button 
with the plus sign under the Application Assignments list) to add an 
application to one of your Spaces desktops. You can select which 
desktop should include an application by clicking the up/down arrows 
next to the Space column for that application’s entry. Just click the 
desired desktop from the pop-up menu that appears. To remove an 
application, click it in the Application Assignments list to select it and 
then click the Remove Application button (which sports a minus sign).
 
 Spaces can even add an application to all your desktops — choose Every 
Space from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts: Click each pop-up menu to set the key 
sequences (and mouse button settings) for all three Spaces functions.
 
 As with Dashboard and Exposé keyboard and mouse shortcuts, you can 
press Shift, Control, Option, and Command keys while the box is open to 
display modified choices.
 
✦ When Switching to an Application: When selected, this check box 
allows you to switch applications between Spaces desktops using the 
Ô+Tab shortcut. Snow Leopard will jump to the desktop that has an 
open window for the application you choose, even if that desktop is not 
currently active.
Language & Text preferences
The Language & Text group appears in Figure 3-8 with the following tabs:
 
✦ Language: Choose the preferred order for language use in menus and 
dialogs as well as the standards that Mac OS X will use for each script 
style.

Language 
& Text pane

✦ Text: Specify character combinations that will be automatically replaced 
with special characters. For example, Snow Leopard will automatically 
replace the combination TM with the special character ™. You can also 
choose a language for spell-checking and turn on “smart” quotes (where 
Snow Leopard chooses double or single quotation marks for you).
 
✦ Formats: Find these settings here:
 
• Dates: You can select a region and use its date conventions (month-
day-year versus day-month-year) or you can click the Customize 
button to build a custom format for both the long date (Saturday, 
September 24, 2005) and short date (9/24/2005) used throughout Mac 
OS X. The changes you make are reflected immediately in the sample 
box at the left.
 
• Times: Click Customize to select a region to use the preset time 
conventions. You can choose 12-hour or 24-hour (military) time 
formats, change the time separator (colons, a period, or a dash), 
and specify different suffixes for morning (a.m.) and evening (p.m.).
 
• Numbers: These convention settings determine the separators used 
for large numbers or numbers with decimals, as well as the currency 
symbol that you want to use and where it appears in a number. You 
can also choose between standard (U.S.) and metric measurement 
systems.
 
✦ Input Sources: Each check box toggles the keyboard layouts available 
from the Input menu. (To display the Input menu on the Finder menu 
bar, click the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check box to select it.) Click 
the Keyboard Shortcuts button to toggle the shortcuts for switching 
layouts and input methods.

Security preferences
The Security group is shown in Figure 3-9.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Set Security 
preferences 
here.
 
Settings here are divided into three tabs:
 
✦ General: To add an extra layer of password security to your laptop 
(which I recommend if you often work in a public area), select the 
Require Password after Sleep or Screen Saver Begins check box. Mac OS 
X then requires that you enter your login password before the system 
returns from a sleep state or exits a screen saver. Click the pop-up 
delay menu to specify when the password requirement will kick in (it’s 
immediate by default). If you’re an admin-level user, you can set the 
global security features in the For All Accounts on This Computer section, 
which affect all user accounts. You can choose to disable the automatic 
login feature, force Mac OS X to require a login password each time that 
a System Preferences pane is opened, automatically log off any user 
after a certain amount of inactivity, or use secure (encrypted) virtual 
memory on your hard drive. You can also mark the Disable Location 
Services check box to turn off the Location feature, preventing applications 
from using information based on your MacBook’s current location.
 
 Don’t want small fingers accidentally controlling your MacBook with the 
Apple Remote? If you don’t need the Remote on a regular basis, click the 
Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver check box to select it. (But 
don’t forget to turn your IR receiver back on for your next movie night!)
 
✦ FileVault: These controls allow you to set the master password for 
FileVault encryption within the current user’s Home folder, which makes 
it virtually impossible for others to access those files. Only an admin-level 
user can set the master password. After the master password is set, you 

Book III
Chapter 3
Delving under the 
Hood with System 
Preferences
233
Getting Personal
can click the Turn On FileVault button to enable FileVault encryption for 
the user who’s currently logged in; the user’s Login password becomes 
his FileVault password as well.
 
✦ Firewall: As I discuss in Book VI, Chapter 6, Mac OS X includes a built-in 
firewall, which you can enable from this pane.
 
 To turn the firewall off entirely, simply click the Stop button. This is the 
very definition of Not a Good Thing, and I always recommend that any 
MacBook hooked up to a network or the Internet have the system firewall 
turned on. (The only exception is if you’re using a network that you 
know to be secure and your access to the Internet is through a router or 
sharing device with its own built-in firewall.)
 
 When the firewall is enabled, click the Advanced button to set 
firewall options.
 
• To turn the firewall on with only Mac OS X application exclusions, 
click Block All Incoming Connections — only the sharing services 
you select on the Sharing pane in System Preferences are allowed 
through your firewall.) This is a good choice for the most security-
conscious MacBook owner, but your firewall will block third-party 
applications that try to access your network or the Internet.
 
• To turn the firewall on with exclusions, click Automatically Allow 
Signed Software to Receive Incoming Connections. (Yep, this is the 
correct option for just about every MacBook owner.) Any connection 
to a service (such as Web Sharing) or an application (such as iChat) 
that isn’t listed is blocked, but you can enable access for third-party 
applications on an as-needed basis.
 
 In firewall-speak, these entries are rules because they determine what’s 
allowed to pass through to your MacBook.
 
 It’s easy to enable communications with a Mac OS X service: Just use the 
Sharing pane within System Preferences to turn on a service, and Snow 
Leopard automatically configures your firewall to allow communications. 
I describe the Sharing pane in detail later in this chapter.
 
 To add a third-party application, click the Advanced button at the 
bottom of the Firewall pane, then click the button with the plus sign. 
Navigate to the application that needs to communicate with the outside 
world. Click the application to select it and then click Add. To delete 
an application, select it in the list and click the button with the minus 
sign. Remember, you don’t have to add any of the applications provided 
by Apple with Snow Leopard, such as Apple Mail, iChat, or Safari; only 
third-party applications that you install yourself need a firewall rule.
 
 You can edit the rule for a specific service or application by clicking the 
rule at the right side of the entry. By default, the rule reads Allow 
Incoming Connections (including both your local network and the 
Internet); however, when you click the rule, you can also choose Block 
Incoming Connections to temporarily deny access to that application.

Getting Personal
 
 If you suddenly can’t connect to other computers or share files that you 
originally could share, review the rules that you’ve enabled from this 
pane. You can also verify that everything’s shipshape in the Sharing 
pane in System Preferences, which I cover later in this chapter.
Spotlight preferences
The Spotlight group is shown in Figure 3-10.
Settings here are
 
✦ Search Results tab: You can enable or disable the check boxes next to 
each of the categories to display or hide each category in the Spotlight 
search menu and dialog. Click and drag the categories to the order 
that you prefer. For example, I like to see matching documents 
immediately after matching applications in the Spotlight dialog, so I 
dragged Documents to the second position in the list. You can also 
specify a different keyboard shortcut for the Spotlight menu and window.
 
✦ Privacy tab: If you don’t want to display the contents of certain folders 
in the Spotlight — for instance, if you work in a hospital setting and you 
can’t allow access to patient information and medical records — click 
the Add button (which carries a plus sign) and specify the folder or disk 
you want to exclude from Spotlight searches. Alternatively, just drag the 
folders or disks to exclude into the list from a Finder window.

Choices here are
 
✦ When You Insert a Blank CD: Click this pop-up menu to specify the 
action that Mac OS X takes when you load a blank CD-R or CD-RW. You 
can choose to be prompted or to open the Finder, iTunes, or Disk Copy. 
Additionally, you can open another application that you select, run an 
AppleScript that you select, or ignore the disc.
 
✦ When You Insert a Blank DVD: Use this feature to specify the action 
that your MacBook takes when you load a recordable DVD.
 
✦ When You Insert a Music CD: Choices from this pop-up menu specify 
what action Mac OS X takes when you load an audio CD. By default, 
iTunes launches.

list on the left and then choose the number of colors (from the Colors 
pop-up menu) to display. In most cases, you want to use the highest 
resolution and the highest number of colors. You can also choose a 
refresh rate (from the, ahem, Refresh Rate pop-up menu). Again, generally, 
the higher the refresh rate, the better. Move the Brightness slider to 
adjust the brightness level of your display. If you’ve connected an 
external monitor or flat-screen TV to your MacBook, click the Detect 
Displays button and Snow Leopard will add them to the list of available 
displays, allowing you to redirect your MacBook’s video signal.
 
 Enable the Show Displays in Menu Bar check box if you’ll be switching 
resolutions and color levels often — this means you, Ms. Image Editor

✦ Color: Click a display color profile that will control the colors on 
your monitor. To load a profile, click the Open Profile button. To 
create a custom ColorSync profile and calibrate the colors that you 
see on your monitor, click the Calibrate button to launch the Display 
Calibrator. (You can also launch it from your Utilities folder within your 
Applications folder.) This easy-to-use assistant walks you step-by-step

Move the Computer Sleep slider to specify when Mac OS X should switch to 
sleep mode. The Never setting here disables sleep mode entirely. To choose 
a separate delay period for blanking your monitor, drag the Display Sleep 
delay slider to the desired period. You can also power down the hard drive 
to conserve energy and prevent wear and tear (an especially good feature 
for laptop owners).
 
If you want to start or shut down your laptop at a scheduled time, click the 
Schedule button. Mark the desired schedule (the Start Up or Wake check 
box and the Shut Down/Sleep check box) to enable them; then click the up 
and down arrows next to the time display to set the trigger time. Click OK to 
return to the Energy Saver pane.
Some of the settings can toggle events that control Snow Leopard’s sleep 
mode, including a network connection by the network administrator (Wake 
for Network Access). If you want the display to dim before your Mac goes 
to sleep, enable the Automatically Reduce Brightness before Display Goes 
to Sleep check box. You can also set Mac OS X to restart automatically 
after a power failure, which is a good idea if you’re sharing music or files 
with others. Naturally, MacBook owners will want to click the Show Battery 
Status in the Menu Bar check box to select it.
 
Mac laptop owners can set two separate Energy Saver configurations by 
clicking one of the two tabs at the top of the pane:
 
✦ Battery Power: Applies when their MacBook is running on battery 
power)
 
✦ Power Adapter: Kicks in when the laptop is connected to an AC outlet
Your MacBook will automatically switch to the proper configuration when 
you plug or unplug your laptop.

The two tabs include
 
✦ Keyboard: Move the Key Repeat Rate slider to alter the rate at which a 
keystroke repeats. You can also adjust the Delay until Repeat slider to 
alter how long a key must be held down before it repeats. If you change 
your keyboard, you can always run the Keyboard Setup Assistant by 
clicking the Change Keyboard Type button — you can also set up a 
wireless Bluetooth keyboard from this pane.
 
 MacBook owners can set the F1–F12 keys as standard function keys 
within applications by enabling the Use All F1, F2, Etc. Keys as Standard 
Function Keys check box. If you enable this feature, you have to hold 
down the Function (or Fn) key while pressing the F1 through F12 keys to 
use the regular hardware keys.
 
 If you have a MacBook Pro, you can choose to turn the ambient keyboard 
lighting on and off from this pane, or turn off keyboard lighting after an 
inactivity delay that you set.

Mouse preferences
Figure 3-15 illustrates the Mouse preferences pane.
 
Figure 3-15: 
The Mouse 
preferences 
pane.
 
The contents of this pane depend on whether your MacBook has a USB or 
wireless Bluetooth mouse installed. If you haven’t installed a mouse yet, you 
see a Waiting screen that leads you through the installation process. After 
you add a mouse, trackball, or other pointing device to your system, you see 
the settings shown in Figure 3-15.
 
✦ Mouse: Drag the Tracking Speed slider to determine how fast the mouse 
tracks across your Desktop. You can also drag the Double-Click Speed 
slider to determine how fast you must click your mouse to cause a 
double-click. Drag the Scrolling Speed slider to specify the rate at which 
the contents of windows will scroll. Lefties might want to change the 
primary mouse button for aftermarket pointing devices. You can also 
zoom the display with your Mighty Mouse scroll ball while holding down 
the key of your choice — a great option for image editing. To install a 
wireless Bluetooth mouse from this pane, click the Set Up Bluetooth 
Mouse button, which runs the Bluetooth device Set Up assistant.
 
✦ (Optional) Bluetooth: If you’re using a wireless Bluetooth mouse or 
keyboard, you can check the battery level on these devices from this 
pane. You can also specify whether your Bluetooth keyboard or mouse 
wakes your Mac from sleep mode. If you don’t have a Bluetooth keyboard 
or mouse, this tab doesn’t appear.

Trackpad preferences
Figure 3-16 illustrates the Trackpad preferences pane.
 
Figure 3-16: 
The 
Trackpad 
preferences

This pane is available only to MacBook owners, allowing this elite crowd to 
customize the tracking speed and double-click speed for their trackpads. 
You can also set your MacBook’s trackpad for two-fingered scrolling (ver-
tical and horizontal) and zooming. (I imagine both will someday become 
Olympic events.) If you prefer to zoom by holding down a key, click the 
pop-up menu to select the key. You can also enable clicking and configure 
right-clicking by using the trackpad.
 
I suggest that you leave the Ignore Accidental Trackpad Input check box 
selected to prevent spurious movements and clicks — and, if you use a 
mouse with your laptop, you can elect to disable the trackpad while the 
mouse is connected. This helps to prevent accidental copies or moves 
within a Finder window!
Printing and fax preferences
Figure 3-17 illustrates the Print & Fax preferences.
Click the Options & Supplies button to configure the selected printer’s fea-
tures, and click the Open Print Queue button to display the Print Queue 
window (no great shockers there). To add a new printer or fax connection, 
click the Add button, which bears a plus sign — Snow Leopard launches 
the Browser. You can read more about printer and fax setup in Book VIII,

The other settings here are
 
✦ Share This Printer on the Network: Click this check box to share 
this printer with other computers on your network. To specify who 
can use your shared printer, click the Set Permissions button. System 
Preferences switches to the Sharing pane, where you can add or remove 
users from the permission list.
 
✦ Default Printer: Click this pop-up menu to select the installed printer that 
acts as the default printer throughout your system. If you choose Last 
Printer Used, Mac OS X uses the printer that received the last print job.
 
✦ Default Paper Size: Will that be US Letter or Tabloid? Click this pop-up 
menu to specify the default paper size for future print jobs.
If you’ve added a fax entry to the list, click the entry to set up the fax 
send/receive functions built into Snow Leopard. To receive faxes on your 
MacBook, you must first set up a fax connection; then, click the Receive 
Options button and select the Receive Faxes on This Computer check box.
After faxing is turned on, you can configure the other settings from the Print 
& Fax pane and the Receive Options sheet. These settings include
 
✦ Fax Number: Enter the phone number that others call to reach your 
MacBook.

242
It’s All about the Hardware
 
✦ When a Fax Arrives: You can determine how many times the phone 
rings before your laptop’s external modem answers the incoming call. 
By default, Mac OS X saves the incoming fax to your Shared Faxes folder, 
but you can change that location — or you can choose to print the 
incoming fax on the printer that you specify. Heck, if you like, you can 
send your fax to both destinations (a disk folder and a printer) or even 
mail the fax to the e-mail address you specify.
 
If you send and receive a large number of faxes, make sure you enable the 
Show Fax Status in Menu Bar check box.
You can also allow other computer users on your local network to send 
faxes through your MacBook. Enable the Share This Fax on the Network 
check box, and your laptop’s external fax modem appears when the other 
users add a fax connection.
Sound preferences
The Sound group is shown in Figure 3-18. To set the overall system audio 
volume, drag the Output Volume slider. To mute all sound from your 
MacBook, select the Mute check box. I recommend that you select the Show 
Volume in Menu Bar check box, which displays a convenient volume slider 
menu bar icon.
 
Figure 3-18:

The three tabs here are
 
✦ Sound Effects: From this pane, you can choose the system alert sound 
and the volume for alerts. You can also choose to mute application and 
Finder menu sound effects, as well as toggle the sample sound effect 
when the volume keys are pressed on your MacBook’s keyboard (or 
from the Volume slider). If you use Front Row with your laptop, you can 
enable or disable the Front Row audio effects from this pane.

You can adjust the balance between the left and right channels for the 
selected output controller.
 
✦ Input: These settings allow you to specify an input source. Unless your 
MacBook includes a Line In input source, leave this set to your Internal 
Microphone. Drag the Input Volume slider to increase or decrease the 
input signal volume; the input level display provides you with real-time 
sound levels. If your MacBook is in a location with a large amount of 
background noise, click the Use Ambient Noise Reduction check box to

respectively, type your MobileMe member name and password to 
display the Account tab. If you want to subscribe, click the Learn More 

244
Sharing the Joy: Internet and Network
button to launch your Web browser and you’re whisked to the MobileMe 
sign-up page. For more information about joining Apple’s MobileMe 
service, see Book VI, Chapter 4.
 
✦ Sync: If you want to synchronize your MacBook (or multiple Macintosh 
computers) with the personal information and data stored online in your 
MobileMe account, select the Synchronize with MobileMe check box and 
click the pop-up menu to specify manual or automatic synchronization. (To 
manually sync, click Sync Now.) You can also specify which categories 
of data you want to sync. Naturally, the fewer categories you choose, the 
less time it takes to sync. To register a computer so that you can sync 
with it, click the Advanced button and then click Register Computer. 
Snow Leopard can display your Sync status in the Finder menu bar.
 
✦ iDisk: This pane displays your current iDisk usage and allows you to 
subscribe for additional space with the Upgrade button. You can set 
your access privileges for your public folder by selecting or deselecting 
the Allow Others to Write Files in Your Public Folder check box, and you 
can add a password that others have to enter before they can access 
your public folder. For a complete description of iDisk, see Book VI, 
Chapter 4.
 
 I recommend that you click the iDisk Sync Start button on the iDisk tab 
to enable the Snow Leopard iDisk syncing function (which creates a local 
copy of your iDisk on your MacBook). Select the Update Automatically 
option; this option allows iDisk to run much faster because Mac OS X 
can read and write by using your local iDisk copy on your hard drive. 
Your MacBook regularly synchronizes the data on your local hard drive 
across the Internet with the iDisk on the Apple server. To make sure that 
you’re always using the most recent copy of a file on your iDisk, select 
the Always Keep the Most Recent Version of a File check box.
 
✦ Back to My Mac: From this list, you can control file and screen sharing 
across all the computers you use with your MobileMe account. To begin 
using the Back to My Mac features, click the Start button. (Remember, 
you’ll have to turn on Back to My Mac on all computers that will use this 
service.)
Network preferences
The Network group is shown in Figure 3-20.
You can choose an existing Location by clicking the Location pop-up menu 
at the top of the dialog, or you can create and edit your Locations by choosing 
Edit Locations from this pop-up menu. (Automatic is the default, and it does 
a pretty good job of figuring out what settings you need.) As I mention in 
Book II, Chapter 3, creating Locations makes it easy to completely reconfigure 
your Network preferences when you connect your computer to other 
networks — for example, when you take your laptop to a branch office. You 
can also set up Locations to accommodate different ISP dial-up telephone 
numbers in different towns.

If you need to create a new Location that’s very similar to an existing 
Location, click the Location pop-up menu and choose Edit Locations. Then 
select the Location that you want to copy, click the Action button (bearing 
the gear symbol), and choose Duplicate Location from the pop-up menu. 
The new Location that you create contains all the same settings (without several 
minutes of retyping), so you can easily edit it and make minor changes 
quickly.
 
You can choose locations from the Apple menu — a useful trick for laptop 
road warriors.
Ethernet network settings
When you select Ethernet from the Services list, the Status pane shows your 
connection information. Because most networks have a DHCP server to 
provide automatic settings, you probably don’t have to change anything; 
Snow Leopard does a good job at making introductions automatic between 
your MacBook and both a local network and the Internet.
 
Notice the very attractive Assist Me . . . button at the bottom of the Network 
pane? It’s there for a very good reason: Click it, and Snow Leopard launches 
a network connection and troubleshooting assistant that guides you step-
by-step. If your ISP doesn’t provide you with instructions on setting up your 
Internet connection — or that oh-so-smart Mr. Network Administrator is too 
busy to help connect your MacBook to your office network — use both this 
book and the network assistant to do the job yourself!
Need to make manual changes to your network settings? Click the Advanced 
button (it’s like opening the hood on your car). The tabs on the Advanced 
sheet include

246
Sharing the Joy: Internet and Network
 
✦ TCP/IP: These settings are provided either automatically (by using 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [DHCP]) or manually (by using 
settings provided by your network administrator).
 
✦ DNS: The settings that you enter here specify the DNS servers and 
search domains used by your ISP. Typically, any changes you make here 
are requested by your ISP or your network administrator. Click the Add 
buttons (with the plus signs) to add a new DNS server address or search 
domain.
 
✦ WINS: Dating back a few years, WINS is a name server required for 
computers running NetBIOS (practically dinosaurs in the computer 
timeline), and likely only those computers running a version of Windows 
older than Windows 2000. If that sounds like gobbledygook to you, you 
need to enter something on this tab only if instructed to do so by your 
network administrator.
 
✦ 802.1X: This tab controls which wireless networking security protocols 
that you may need to connect to a third-party wireless base station or 
access point. Click the Add Configuration button (with our friend the 
plus sign) to create a new wireless connection configuration, including 
your username, password, and the protocols that need to be used. 
Note that these settings are set automatically when making a wireless 
connection with an Apple AirPort Extreme base station.
 
✦ Proxies: Network proxy servers are used as part of a firewall configuration 
to help keep your network secure, but in most cases, changing them can 
cause you to lose Internet functionality if you enter the wrong settings.
 
 Most folks using a telephone modem, cable modem, or digital subscriber 
line (DSL) connection should leave these settings alone. Enable and 
change these settings only at the request of your network administrator, 
who should supply you the location of a PAC file to automate the process.
 
 If you’ve enabled your Mac OS X firewall and you use FTP to transfer 
files, enable the Passive FTP Mode check box on the Proxies pane. I 
recommend that you enable this setting to allow downloading from 
some Web pages as well.
 
✦ Ethernet: From this pane, you can configure the settings for your 
Ethernet network interface card. I strongly recommend that you leave 
the Configure pop-up menu set to Automatically (unless specifically told 
to set things manually by your system administrator or that nice person 
from Apple tech support).
Modem network settings
When you select Modem from the Services list, you can enter the tele-
phone number, account name, and password provided by your ISP. In most 
cases, that’s all the information you need. But if you need to make a manual 
change, click the Advanced button to display these tabs:

Book III

Sharing the Joy: Internet and Network
 
✦ Modem: Click the Modem pop-up menu and choose the brand and 
model of your external modem.
 
 I strongly recommend that you enable the Enable Error Correction and 
Compression in Modem check box; also select Wait for Dial Tone before 
Dialing from the Dial Mode pop-up menu. These settings provide you 
with the best performance and the fastest speeds.
 
 You can also select tone or pulse dialing and whether you want to hear 
the two modems conversing. (If the caterwauling bothers you, turn off 
the Sound option.)
 
✦ DNS: These settings are the same as those I cover earlier, in the section 
“Ethernet network settings.”
 
✦ WINS: Again, you’re likely to never need these WINS settings, so 
make changes on this tab only if instructed to do so by your network 
administrator.
 
✦ Proxies: Some ISPs use proxy servers for their dial-up accounts to 
maintain security, but changing these settings willy-nilly is inviting 
disaster. Leave them disabled unless given specific instructions on what 
to set by your ISP.
 
✦ PPP: These settings are used for a Point-to-Point Protocol connection 
over a telephone modem. Again, your ISP provides you with the right 
values to enter here.
 
 If you’re concerned about who’s using your Internet connection — or 
you want to add an extra layer of security when you dial out — select 
the Prompt for Password after Dialing check box on the PPP tab, and 
Mac OS X prompts you each time for your Internet account password.
I recommend that you select the Show Modem Status in Menu Bar check 
box on the Modem status pane, which gives you a visual reference on your 
connection status.
FireWire and AirPort network settings
The FireWire and AirPort settings on the Advanced sheet are the same 
as those for Ethernet that I cover earlier in this chapter. However, three 
settings are on the AirPort status pane that I cover here:
 
✦ Network Name: Snow Leopard handles wireless connections automatically 
in most cases; if possible, it connects to the last wireless network you 
joined. If that network isn’t available or there are others to choose from, 
Snow Leopard displays a dialog asking you which available network you 
want to join. If you want to join only one or more preferred networks 
(for security or convenience reasons), click the Advanced button and 
click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to enter the wireless 
network name and password.

248
Sharing the Joy: Internet and Network
 
✦ Turn AirPort Off: Okay, here’s the honest truth — wireless networking 
is a significant drain on a laptop battery! If you’re sure you’re not going 
to use your MacBook’s AirPort network hardware in the near future, you 
can click this button to activate and deactivate your laptop’s network 
hardware. Turn off AirPort if you don’t need it, and your laptop will 
thank you. (Just turn it back on using this same button when you need it 
or use the AirPort status menu in the Finder menu bar.)
 
✦ Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar: Hey, speaking of the AirPort Status 
Menu in the Finder Menu Bar . . . select this check box to display it! You 
can immediately see the relative signal strength of your connection, 
switch among available wireless networks, and turn off your AirPort 
hardware to conserve your battery power (without digging deeply into 
System Preferences).
Bluetooth preferences
Since your MacBook has Bluetooth hardware available, the Bluetooth group, 
as shown in Figure 3-21, appears.
 
Figure 3-21: 
The 
Bluetooth 
pane.
 
The choices on this pane include
 
✦ Device listing: From this pane, you can opt to allow other Bluetooth 
devices to discover your MacBook (with the Discoverable check box). 
All recognized Bluetooth devices in range appear in the list, and you 
can configure or disconnect them. You can also set up a new Bluetooth 
device from here by clicking the Set Up New Device button. Also, if you 
like, Snow Leopard can display a Bluetooth status menu in the Finder 
menu bar.
 
 MacBook owners who want to conserve power can disable Bluetooth 
entirely. Just click the Off check box and you save a significant amount 
of battery time!

✦ Advanced sheet: Click the Advanced button to display another group 
of settings. The Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant check box determines 
whether Snow Leopard automatically launches the Bluetooth Setup 
Assistant when no Bluetooth devices are recognized. If you’re using 
a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, you can wake your MacBook using 
these devices. You can set Snow Leopard to alert you if an audio 
request is received from a Bluetooth device, and you can share an 
Internet connection with connected devices.
 
 You can also edit your Bluetooth Serial Ports from the Advanced sheet, 
allowing you to use a Bluetooth connection as a virtual serial port. You 
can add or remove serial services from the Serial Port sheet as well.
Sharing preferences
Figure 3-22 illustrates the Sharing preferences.
 
Figure 3-22: 
The Sharing

Click the Edit button to change the default network name assigned to your 
MacBook during the installation process. Your current network name is 
listed in the Computer Name text field.
Each entry in the services list controls a specific type of sharing, including 
DVD or CD Sharing, File Sharing (with other Macs and PCs running Windows), 
Web Sharing, Screen Sharing, Remote Login, Remote Management (using 
Apple Remote Desktop), Remote Apple Events, Xgrid Sharing, Internet 
Sharing, Bluetooth Sharing, Scanner Sharing, and Printer Sharing. To turn on 
any of these services, select the On check box for that service. To turn off a 
service, click the corresponding On check box to deselect it.

250
Tweaking the System
From a security standpoint, I highly recommend that you enable only those 
services that you actually use. Each service you enable automatically opens 
your Snow Leopard firewall for that service. A Mark’s Maxim to remember:
 
Poking too many holes in your firewall is not A Good Thing.
When you click one of the services in the list, the right side of the Sharing 
pane changes to display the settings you can specify for that particular 
service. Note that some services may be disabled, depending on the 
hardware connected to or installed in your MacBook.
Tweaking the System
The last section of the System Preferences window covers system-wide 
settings that affect all users and the overall operation of Mac OS X.
Accounts preferences
The Accounts group is illustrated in Figure 3-23.
 
Figure 3-23:

 You can set a different MobileMe account name and password for each 
user account from this pane as well. If you’re sharing your Mac with a 
number of other users, each person can set up his or her own MobileMe 
account!
 
 If you have administrator access, you can enable Parental Controls for 
the selected user account or open the Parental Controls pane. (More on 
Parental Controls later in this section as well as in Chapter 5 of Book III.)
 
✦ Picture well: From the Picture well — the square area to the right of the 
Account list — you can choose one of the thumbnail images provided by 
Apple to represent you, or drag a photo in from iPhoto. Click the well to 
display the thumbnails. Click Edit Picture to drag a new image from the 
Finder or take a video snapshot using your MacBook’s iSight camera.
 
✦ Login Items pane: The applications and documents that you add to 
this list launch automatically each time that the current user logs in to 
Mac OS X. To add an application, click the Add button (which carries 
a plus sign), navigate to the desired application and select it, and then 
click the Add button. (Alternatively, you can simply drag an item from a 
Finder window into the Login Items list.) To remove an application from 
the list, click to select it and then click the Remove button (which has 
a minus sign). Each application can be launched in a hidden state — its 
window doesn’t appear on the Desktop. To toggle an item as hidden or 
visible, enable the Hide check box next to the desired application. The 
order that Login Items are launched can be changed by dragging entries 
in the list into the desired sequence.
 
 Note that a user must be logged in to view and change the items on 
the Login Items pane — even an Administrator-level user can’t access 
another user account’s Login items!
 
 You can even set up Login Items directly from the Dock! Control-click 
(or right-click) the desired Dock icon to display the pop-up menu and 
then click Open at Login.
 
✦ Login Options pane: Look for the button with the little house icon, 
lower left. If you’re using an admin-level account, click it to set a number 
of global options that control how users log in. For example, you can 
choose to display either a Name and Password field on the Login screen 
(which means that the user must actually type in the correct username) 
or a list of users, from which a person can select a user ID. (If security is 
a consideration, use the Name and Password option.) You can also add 
VoiceOver spoken interface support at the Login screen, making it easier 
for physically challenged users to log in to this MacBook.

252
Tweaking the System
 
If you choose, you can log in automatically as the selected user by clicking 
the Automatically Login <Username> pop-up menu and choosing your 
account. (Not a particularly secure feature for MacBook owners, but 
convenient as all get-out.)
The Login Options pane also allows you to enable or disable Fast User 
Switching (which I discuss in Book III, Chapter 4), and you can prevent 
anyone from restarting or shutting down the MacBook from the Login screen 
by selecting the Hide the Restart and Shut Down Buttons check box.
Date and time preferences
Click the System Preferences Date & Time icon to display the settings that 
you see in Figure 3-24.

calendar; to set the system time, click in the field above the clock and 
type the current time.
 
 You can’t set these values manually if you use a network time server. To 
automatically set your MacBook’s system time and date from a network 
time server, select the Set Date & Time Automatically check box and 
then choose a server from the pop-up menu that corresponds to your 
location. (Of course, you need an Internet connection to use a network 
time server.)

✦ Time Zone: Click your approximate location on the world map to choose 
a time zone or click the Closest City pop-up menu and choose the city 
that’s closest to you (and shares your same time zone). Alternatively, 
select the Set Time Zone Automatically Using Current Location check 
box — a real convenience for MacBook owners who are constantly 
traveling.
 
✦ Clock: If you select the Show the Date and Time in Menu Bar check box, 
you can choose to view the time in text or icon format. You can also 
optionally display seconds, the date, AM/PM, and the day of the week; 
have the time separator characters flash; or use a clock based on 24 
hours.
 
 Personally, I get a big kick out of my MacBook announcing the time on 
the hour . . . plus, it helps pull me back into the real world. (You have 
to eat sooner or later.) Anyway, if you’d like this helpful reminder as 
well, select the Announce the Time check box on the Clock pane, and 
click the pop-up menu to select an hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour 
announcement.
Parental Controls preferences
Click a standard level user account in the list to enable or configure Parental 
Controls for that user. Figure 3-25 shows the Parental Controls settings. 
(Parental Controls are disabled for administrator accounts and the Guest 
account.)

Tweaking the System
I discuss the Parental Control settings in detail in Chapter 5 of Book III. You 
can use these settings to restrict a user’s access to certain applications, or 
limit Mail and iChat communications to specific individuals. An administrator 
can also switch a user account to the Simple Finder, making Snow Leopard 
much easier to navigate (and limiting the amount of damage a mischievous 
or malicious user can inflict on your system).
Software Update preferences
The Software Update settings are shown in Figure 3-26. (Oh, and don’t forget 
that you need an active Internet connection.)

box; I also recommend that you choose Daily or Weekly from the pop-up 
menu. (You can also elect to download critical updates in the background 
automatically while you continue working.) To check immediately, click 
the Check Now button.
 
✦ Installed Updates: Click this tab to display a list of the updates you’ve 
already applied to Mac OS X and Apple applications. You can open the

features.
 
The two tabs here are
 
✦ Speech Recognition: This pane has two tabs of its own: Settings and 
Commands. With Speakable Items toggled on, you can control Snow 
Leopard with spoken commands.
 
• Settings tab: If you have more than one microphone, you can select 
which one you want to use as well as set the input volume with the 
Calibrate button. You can change the Listening key (Esc by default) 
and specify whether your MacBook should listen only while the key 
is pressed or whether the Listening Key toggles listening on and off. 
You can also change the name of your computer (using the Keyword 
box) and whether that name is required before a command. From the 
Play This Sound pop-up menu, you can indicate what sound effect 
Mac OS X plays when it recognizes a speech command. (Optionally, 
Snow Leopard can confirm the command by speaking it if you enable 
the Speak Command Acknowledgement check box.)
 
• Commands tab: Here, you can select which types of commands are 
available as well as whether exact wording of command names is 
required. Click the self-named button to open the Speakable Items 
Folder from this pane. Read more about these settings in Book IX, 
Chapter 3.
 
✦ Text to Speech: Here’s a fun pane. Click a voice from the System Voice 
pop-up menu, and Mac OS X uses that voice to speak to you from dialogs 
and applications. You can set the Speaking Rate (from Slow to Fast) and 
play a sample by clicking the Play button. (Try Zarvox, Bubbles, and 
Pipe Organ.)

256
Tweaking the System
 
 The Announce When Alerts are Displayed feature actually speaks the 
text within alert dialogs; to configure spoken alerts, click the Set Alert 
Options button. You can optionally add a phrase before the text, which 
you can choose from the Phrase pop-up menu. To add a phrase to the 
list, like Don’t Panic!, choose Edit Phrase List from the list. Move the 
Delay slider to specify how much time your Mac waits before reading 
the dialog to you.
 
 You can also optionally announce when an application wants your 
attention, and Snow Leopard can speak the text that’s currently selected 
within an application when you press a key that you specify.
This pane also provides a couple of convenient shortcut buttons that take 
you to other “speech centers” within System Preferences — specifically, the 
Date & Time and Universal Access panes.
Startup Disk preferences
Figure 3-28 illustrates the Startup Disk settings.
 
Figure 3-28: 
The Startup 
Disk pane 
within 
System 
Preferences.
 
To select a startup disk, click the desired startup drive from the scrolling 
icon list.
Mac OS X displays the version numbers of each system and the physical 
drives where each system resides. Select the Network Startup icon if you 
want to boot from a System folder on your local network; typically, such a 
folder is created by your network administrator. If you’ve set up a Windows 
partition on your hard drive using Boot Camp, the folder appears with a 
Windows logo.
 
If you’re planning on rebooting with an external Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
or FireWire startup disk, that disk must be connected already, powered on, 
and recognized by the system before you display these settings.

Click Target Disk Mode to restart your MacBook as a FireWire external hard 
drive connected to another computer. (This comes in especially handy when 
you’re upgrading to a new Mac and you need to move files between the two 
computers. I’ve also used it when the video card in one of my Macs decided 
to stop working. This allowed me to make an updated backup copy of the 
ailing Mac’s hard drive before I sent it off for repair.) You can also restart 
your MacBook and hold down the T key to invoke Target Disk Mode.
After you click a disk to select it, click the Restart button. Mac OS X confirms 
your choice, and your MacBook reboots.
Time Machine preferences
The Preferences pane shown in Figure 3-29 controls the automatic backups 
performed by Snow Leopard’s Time Machine feature.
 
Figure 3-29: 
Configure 
your 
backups 
with these 
Time 
Machine

To enable Time Machine, click the On toggle switch and then select a disk 
that will hold your Time Machine backup data on the sheet that appears; 
click Use for Backup to confirm your choice. If you have an external Time 
Capsule wireless unit, click Set Up Time Capsule.
By default, Time Machine backs up all the hard drives on your system; 
however, you may not need to back up some hard drives or folders on your 
MacBook. To save time and hard drive space, Time Machine allows you to 
exclude specific drives and folders from the backup process. Click Options 
and then click the Add button (with the plus sign) to select the drives or 
folders you want to exclude, and they’ll appear in the Do Not Back Up list.
 
To remove an exclusion, select it in the list and click the Delete button (with 
the minus sign). Note the Total Included figure increases, and Time Machine 
adds the item you deleted from the list to the next backup.

258
Tweaking the System
By default, Snow Leopard warns you when deleting older backup files, but 
you can turn this off from the Options sheet as well.
 
You can elect to back up your MacBook immediately by clicking the Time 
Machine icon in the Finder menu bar and choosing Back Up Now.
Universal Access preferences
The final group, Universal Access, is shown in Figure 3-30. These settings 
modify the display and sound functions within Mac OS X to make them more 
friendly to physically challenged users. Note that if you select the VoiceOver 
On radio button, Mac OS X speaks the text for all text and buttons onscreen.

If you have an assistive device that’s recognized by Mac OS X, select 
the Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box to allow it to be used 
throughout the operating system. You can also elect to display the Universal 
Access status icon in the Finder menu bar.
The four tabs here are
 
✦ Seeing: These settings make it easier for those with limited vision to 
use Mac OS X. You can toggle VoiceOver on and off from here; I discuss 
more on this feature and these settings in Book IX, Chapter 3. To turn 
on the display Zoom feature, select the Zoom On radio button or press 
Ô+Option+8.

Tweaking the System
 
 To specify how much magnification is used, click the Options button. 
From the sheet that appears, you can set the minimum and maximum 
Zoom magnification increments. From the keyboard, use Ô+Option+= 
(equal sign) to zoom in and Ô+Option+– (minus sign) to zoom out. 
Optionally, you can display a preview rectangle of the area that’s 
included when you zoom. Mac OS X can smooth images to make them 
look better when zoomed; click the Options button in the Zoom section 
of the pane and select the Smooth Images check box.
 
 You can also determine how the screen moves in relation to the trackpad 
pointer from the Zoom Options sheet: By default, the zoomed screen 
moves with the pointer, but you can set it to move only when the 
pointer reaches the edge of the screen or maintain the pointer near the 
center of the zoomed image automatically. If your mouse has a scroll 
wheel or ball, you can specify a modifier key to activate the Zoom feature.
 
 If you prefer white text on a black background, select the White on Black 
radio button (or press the Ô+Option+Control+8 keyboard shortcut). 
Note that depending on your display settings, it might be easier on the 
eyes to use grayscale display mode by selecting the Use Grayscale check 
box. Drag the Enhance Contrast slider to increase the contrast between 
text and background.
 
✦ Hearing: If you need additional visual cues to supplement the spoken 
and audio alerts in Mac OS X, click this tab and select the Flash the 
Screen When an Alert Sound Occurs check box. Two-channel stereo 
audio can be reduced to single-channel mono audio with the Play Stereo 
Audio as Mono check box. To raise the overall sound volume in Mac OS 
X, you can click the Adjust Volume button to display the Sound System 
Preferences settings, where you can drag the Volume slider to the right.
 
✦ Keyboard: These settings help those who have trouble pressing keyboard 
shortcuts or those who often trigger keyboard repeats (repetition of 
the same character) accidentally. If you mark the Sticky Keys On radio 
button, you can use modifier keys individually that are grouped together 
automatically as a single keyboard shortcut — in other words, you can 
press the modifier keys in a key sequence one after another instead of 
all together. Sticky Keys can be toggled on and off from the keyboard by 
pressing the Shift key five times. (You can optionally specify that Mac 
OS X sound a beep tone when a modifier key is pressed and whether the 
modifier keys are displayed onscreen.)
 
 Turn Slow Keys on to add a pause (of the length that you specify) 
between when a key is pressed and when it’s actually acted upon within 
Mac OS X. You can optionally add a key-click sound each time you press 
a key. To turn keyboard repeat off entirely, click the Set Key Repeat 
button, which opens the Keyboard preference settings that I discuss 
earlier.

260
Tweaking the System
 
✦ Mouse & Trackpad: With Mouse Keys active, you can use the numeric 
keypad to move the mouse pointer across your screen. Mouse Keys can 
be toggled on and off by pressing the Option key five times. Drag the 
Initial Delay and Maximum Speed sliders to specify how long you must 
hold down a keypad key before the pointer starts to move as well as 
how fast the pointer should move across the screen. You can also 
disable the trackpad on your MacBook when using Mouse Keys.
 
 If you prefer a larger pointer, the cursor can be resized to make it easier 
to spot onscreen. You can also click the Open Keyboard Preferences 
button to turn on Full Keyboard Access or to remap keyboard shortcuts 
for both the Finder and many applications.

Can Use My MacBook, Too?
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding how multiuser systems work

✓ Changing the appearance of the login screen
✓ Tightening security during login
✓ Starting applications automatically when you log in
W
hether you’re setting up Mac OS X for use in a public library or 
simply allowing your 12-year-old to use your MacBook in your 
home office, configuring Snow Leopard for multiple users is a simple task. 
However, you must also consider the possible downsides of a mismanaged 
multiuser system: files and folders being shared that you didn’t want in the 
public domain, users logging in as one another, and the very real possibility 
of accidental file deletion (and worse).
Therefore, in this chapter, I show you how to take those first steps before 
you open Pandora’s Box — setting login options, configuring the personal 
account that you created when you first installed the operating system, and 
protecting your stuff. (Network administrators call this security check-up 
locking things down. Better start using the terminology now, even before you 
buy your suspenders and pocket protector.)
How Multiuser Works on Mac OS X
When you create multiple users in Mac OS X, each person who uses your 
MacBook — hence the term user — has a separate account (much like an 
account that you might open at a bank). Mac OS X creates a Home folder 
for each user and saves that user’s preferences independently from those 
of other users. When you log in to Mac OS X, you provide a username and a 
password, which identifies you. The username/password combination tells 
Mac OS X which user has logged on — and, therefore, which preferences 
and Home folder to use.

262
How Multiuser Works on Mac OS X
Each account also carries a specific level, which determines how much 
control the user has over Mac OS X and the computer itself. Without an 
account with the proper access level, for example, a user might not be able 
to display many of the panes in System Preferences.
The three most common account levels are
 
✦ Root: Also called System Administrator, this über-account can change 
anything within Mac OS X — and that’s usually A Very Bad Thing, so it’s 
actually disabled as a default. (This alone should tell you that the Root 
account shouldn’t be toyed with.) For instance, the Root account can 
seriously screw up the UNIX subsystem within Mac OS X, or a Root user 
can delete files within the Mac OS X System Folder.
 
 Enable the System Administrator account and use it only if told to 
do so by an Apple technical support technician. (And don’t forget to 
disable it immediately afterward!)
 
✦ Administrator: (Or admin for short.) This is the account level that 
you’re assigned when you install Mac OS X. The administrator account 
should not be confused with the System Administrator account!
 
 It’s perfectly okay for you or anyone you assign to use an administrator 
account. An administrator can install applications anywhere on the 
system, create/edit/delete user accounts, and make changes to all the 
settings in System Preferences. However, an administrator can’t move 
or delete items from any other user’s Home folder within the Finder, and 
administrators are barred from modifying or deleting files in the Mac OS 
X System Folder.
 
 A typical multiuser Mac OS X computer has only one administrator — 
like a teacher in a classroom — but technically, you can create as many 
administrator accounts as you like. If you do need to give someone else 
this access level, assign it only to a competent, experienced user whom 
you trust.
 
✦ Standard: A standard user account is the default in Mac OS X. Standard 
users can install software and save documents only in their Home folders 
and the Shared folder (which resides in the Users folder), and they can 
change only certain settings in System Preferences. Thus, they can do 
little damage to the system as a whole. For example, each of the students 
in a classroom should be given a standard-level account for the Mac OS X 
system that they share.
 
 If Parental Controls are applied to a standard account, it becomes a 
managed account, allowing you to fine-tune what a standard account 
user can do. (I discuss Parental Controls at length in Book III, Chapter 5.)
Chapter 5 of this minibook covers the entire process of creating and editing 
a user account.

Configuring Your Login Screen
Configuring Your Login Screen
Take a look at the changes you can make to the login process. First, Mac OS X 
provides two methods of displaying the login screen, as well as one automatic 
method that doesn’t display the login screen at all:
 
✦ Logging in with a list: To log in, click your account username in the 
list, and the login screen displays the password prompt. Type your 
password — Mac OS X displays bullet characters to ensure security — 
and press Return (or click the Log In button).
 
✦ Logging in with username and password: Type your account username 
in the Name field and press Tab. Then type your password and press 
Return (or click the Log In button).
 
✦ Automatic Login: With Automatic Login set, Mac OS X automatically 
logs in the specified account when you reboot. In effect, you never 
see the login screen unless you click Log Out from the Apple menu. 
(Naturally, this is an attractive option to use if your computer is in a 
secure location — such as your office — and you’ll be the only one using 
your MacBook. However, if your laptop falls into The Wrong Hands, 
you’re inviting trouble . . . and identity theft.)
To specify which type of login screen you see — if you see one at all — head 
to System Preferences, click Accounts, and then click the Login Options 
button. (If the pane is locked, click the Lock icon and supply your admin 
password.)
The Guest account is a convenient method of 
granting someone temporary access to your 
MacBook — in fact, your guest doesn’t even 
need a password to log in! Your Guest account 
has all the attributes of a standard account, so 
the visitor has little chance of accidentally (or 
purposefully) damaging your system. However, 
after the guest user logs out, the Guest account 
is “flushed” and all the data and files that that 
person created using the account and stored 
in the guest’s Home directory are deleted 
automatically. (This allows the next guest to 
start with a clean slate.)
By default, the Guest account is disabled. To 
turn on this feature, open System Preferences, 
click Accounts, and then click the Guest 
Account entry in the list. (You may have to 
click the Lock icon in the lower-left corner of 
the Accounts pane and provide your admin 
password before you can continue.) Click the 
Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check 
box to enable it.
Oh, and don’t forget that you can enable 
specific Parental Controls for the Guest 
account, just as you can for any other account. 
That should come in handy if your daughter has 
a slumber party coming up this weekend . . . .
Working with the Guest account

264
Configuring Your Login Screen
 
✦ To set Automatic Login, display the Login Options settings and click the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu. Choose the account that automatically logs 
in from the list. When Mac OS X displays the user Name and Password 
sheet that you see in Figure 4-1, type the corresponding password and 
then click OK.
 
Figure 4-1: 
Configuring 
Automatic 
Login 
from the 
Accounts 
pane.
 
 
 Never set the Automatic Login feature to an admin-level account 
unless you’re sure to be the only one using your MacBook. If the 
computer is rebooted, you’re opening the door for anyone to simply 
sashay in and wreak havoc!
 
✦ To determine whether Mac OS X uses a list login screen, you must 
again visit the Login Options settings pane (see Figure 4-2). Select the 
List of Users radio button for a list login screen or select the Name and 
Password radio button for a simple login screen where you must type 
your username and password.
 
To change settings specific to your account — no matter what your access 
level — log in with your account, open System Preferences, and click 
Accounts. From here, you can change your account password and picture, 
the card marked as yours within the Address Book, and the Login Items 
launched automatically when you log in. (Peruse more information on the 
Address Book in Book I, Chapter 6.)
To log out of Mac OS X without restarting or shutting down the computer, 
choose the Apple menu and then choose Log Out or just press Ô+Shift+Q. 
You see the confirmation dialog, as shown in Figure 4-3. Although Mac OS X 
will display the login screen after two minutes, someone can still saunter up

and click the Cancel button, thereby gaining access to your stuff. Therefore, 
make it a practice to always click the Log Out button on this screen before 
your hand leaves the mouse, or bypass the confirmation dialog altogether by 
holding down the Option key as you click Log Out from the menu!

Will that be

Figure 4-3:

You can also enable Fast User Switching from the Login Options pane. This 
feature allows another user to sit down and log in while the previous user’s 
applications are still running in the background. When you enable switching, 
Snow Leopard displays the currently active user’s full name or account icon 
at the right side of the Finder menu bar. Click the name, and a menu appears; 
click Login Window, and another user can then log in as usual. (From the 
Login Options pane, you can also choose to display the current user by the 
account’s short name or the account icon.)
Even though you’re playing musical chairs, the Big X remembers what’s run-
ning and the state of your Desktop when you last left it. (When you decide to 
switch back, Snow Leopard prompts you for that account’s login password 
for security . . . just in case, you understand.)

266
Locking Things Down
Locking Things Down
If security is a potential problem and you still need to share a Mac between 
multiple users, lock things down. To protect Mac OS X from unauthorized 
use, take care of these potential security holes immediately:
 
✦ Disable the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down buttons. Any computer can 
be hacked when it’s restarted or turned on, so disable the Restart and 
Shut Down buttons on the login screen. (After a user has successfully 
logged in, Mac OS X can be shut down normally by using the menu item 
or the keyboard shortcuts that I cover earlier.) Open the Accounts pane 
in System Preferences, click the Login Options button, and deselect the 
Show the Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down Buttons check box. Press Ô+Q 
to quit and save your changes. (You can find more about restarting and 
shutting down in Book II, Chapter 2.)
 
✦ Disable list logins. With a list login, any potential hacker already knows 
half the information necessary to gain entry to your system — and often 
the password is easy to guess. Therefore, set Mac OS X to ask for the 
username and password on the Login screen, as I describe earlier. This 
way, someone has to guess both the username and the password, which 
is a much harder proposition.
 
✦ Disable Automatic Login. A true no-brainer. As I mention earlier in the 
chapter, Automatic Login is indeed very convenient. However, all someone 
has to do is reboot your MacBook, and the machine automatically logs 
in one lucky user! To disable Automatic Login, display the Accounts 
pane in System Preferences and click the Login Options button; then 
click the Automatic Login pop-up menu and click the Off entry.
 
✦ Disable the password hint. By default, Mac OS X obligingly displays 
the password hint for an account after three unsuccessful attempts 
at entering a password. Where security is an issue, this is like serving 
a hacker a piece of apple pie. Therefore, head to System Preferences, 
display the Accounts settings, click the Login Options button, and make 
sure that the Show Password Hints check box is empty.
 
✦ Select passwords intelligently. Although using your mother’s maiden 
name for a password might seem like a great idea, the best method of 
selecting a password is to use a completely random group of mixed 
letters and numbers. If you find a random password too hard to remember, 
at least add a number after your password, like dietcoke1 — and no, that 
isn’t one of my passwords. (Nice try.) My editor suggests a favorite 
location spelled backwards, with a number mixed in — easier to remember 
than a completely random sequence of characters!
 
 For even greater security, make at least one password character 
uppercase, and use a number at the beginning and ending of the 
password. Or, do the “c001” thing and replace characters with 
numbers, like the zero that you insert in dietc0ke.

Starting Applications Automatically after Login
Starting Applications Automatically after Login
Here’s one other advantage to logins: Each account can have its own 
selection of applications that run automatically when that user logs in. 
These applications are Login Items, and they appear as a list in the Accounts 
pane (shown in Figure 4-4). A caveat or two:
 
✦ The user setting his or her Login Items must be logged in. Only the 
user can modify his or her own Login Items.
 
✦ Users must have access to System Preferences. If the person is using a 
standard-level account, it must allow access to System Preferences.

with the plus sign to navigate to the desired application, select it, and then 
click Add. (Alternatively, you can just drag items from a Finder window and 
drop them directly into the list.) Note that items in the list are launched in 
order — if something needs to run before something else, you can drag the 
item entries into any sequence.
To launch the application in hidden mode — which might or might not 
display it in the Dock, depending on the application itself — click the list 
entry for the desired item and select its Hide check box.

n Chapter 4 of this minibook, I introduce you to the different Mac OS X 
multiuser account levels and the login process. In this chapter, if you’re 
ready to share your MacBook with others, you can discover how to add 
new accounts and edit existing accounts. Oh, and yes, I also show you how 
to frag — that’s multiplayer game-speak for delete — accounts that you no 
longer need. I also demonstrate how to add optional limitations to an indi-
vidual user account and how to avoid using a keychain (which is supposed 
to make it easier to store that pocketful of passwords that you’ve created 
on the Internet).
Yes, you read correctly. By all that’s good and righteous, Mac OS X actually 
has a feature that I don’t want you to use. Read on to find out more.
Adding, Editing, and Deleting Users
All multiuser account chores take place in a single System Preferences pane. 
(Cue James Bond theme song.) The Accounts pane is the star of this chap-
ter, so open System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
If you haven’t added any users to your system yet, the Users list should look 
like Figure 5-1. You should see your account, which you set up when you 
installed Mac OS X, set to administrator (admin) level.
 
You also have an entry for a Guest account, which anyone can use on an as-
needed basis. To enable the Guest account, click the Guest entry in the list 
and click the Allow Guests to Log In to This Computer check box to select it. 
Note that any files created inside the Guest Home folder or settings changed 
by the Guest user are automatically deleted when the Guest user logs out 
(or you restart or reboot your Mac).

Adding a new user account
To add a new user account, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Accounts pane in System Preferences, click the New User 
button — which carries a plus sign — to display an empty user record 
sheet that you see in Figure 5-2.

 If the New User button is disabled and you can’t click it, click the lock at 
the bottom left of the System Preferences pane and provide your pass-
word to unlock the Accounts pane.

2. Select the access level for this user from the New Account pop-up menu.
 
 By default, the user receives a standard level account. You can also 
choose an Administrator account, a sharing-only account (with access 
only to shared files), or a Managed standard account with Parental 
Controls already enabled.
 
3. In the Name text box, type the name that you want to display for this 
account (both in the Accounts list and on the Login screen) and then 
press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 Mac OS X automatically generates an Account (or short) name for use as 
your screen and Buddy name in iChat and various network applications. 
The short name is also the name of the folder that Mac OS X creates on 
the computer’s hard drive for this user. You can keep the default short 
name or type a new one, but it must not contain any spaces. Choose the 
short name carefully, for it can’t be changed within the Finder. For more 
on iChat, jump to Book VI, Chapter 3. (I’ll wait for you here.)
 
4. Press Tab again.
 
5. In the Password text box, type the password for the new account.
 
 Click the button with the key icon next to the Password field, and Snow 
Leopard is happy to display the Password Assistant, complete with a 
suggestion. Click the Suggestion pop-up menu to see additional sugges-
tions. You can choose the length of the password and select from sev-
eral types: letters and numbers, numbers only, memorable, completely 
random, or even government-quality. The Assistant automatically copies 
the current password you’re considering to the Password text box.
 
 As always, when you enter a password or its verification, Mac OS X dis-
plays bullet characters for security.
 
6. Press Tab, type the password in the Verify text box, and press Tab again.
 
7. (Optional) If you decide to use the password hint feature that I 
describe in Book II, Chapter 4, you can enter a short sentence or ques-
tion in the Password Hint text box.
 
 The hint is displayed after three unsuccessful attempts at entering the 
account password.
 
 I recommend that you do not use this option. Think about it: Any hack 
could type in anything three times to get your hint to pop up! If you do 
use this option, at least make sure that the hint is sufficiently vague!
 
 Press Tab to continue.
 
8. To automatically turn on the FileVault encryption feature for this new 
account, select the Turn On FileVault protection check box.
 
 For more information on FileVault, see the sidebar later in this chapter 
entitled “So you like your privacy . . .”

9. Click the Create Account button to finish and create the account.
 
 The new account shows up in the Accounts list and in the Login screen.
Editing an existing account
If you have administrator access, it’s a cinch to make changes to an existing 
account from the Accounts pane in System Preferences. (Often, this is to 
assign a personalized account picture, so I demonstrate that here.) Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the account that you want to change in the Accounts list.
 
 Don’t forget, if the accounts in the list are disabled and you can’t select 
one, you must unlock the Accounts pane. Click the lock at the bottom 
left of the System Preferences window and type your password.
 
2. Edit the settings that you need to change.
These days, everyone’s interested in secur-
ing his or her personal files from prying eyes. 
Granted, this isn’t a problem if you’re the only one 
using your MacBook. However, if you’re shar-
ing a computer in a multiuser environment — 
or there’s even a remote chance your laptop 
might be lost or stolen — you might want a little 
more protection than just user permissions for 
those all-important Fantasy Football formations 
that you’ll unleash next season.
Never fear, Snow Leopard offers a feature 
called FileVault, which provides Home folder 
encryption that prevents just about anyone 
except the NSA or FBI from gaining access to 
the files in your Home folder. (You’ll notice that 
things slow down just a bit when logging in and 
out or working with files that are several giga-
bytes in size, but for those of us who need the 
peace of mind, this minimal performance hit is 
worth it.) You can enable the FileVault feature 
from the Security pane in System Preferences. 
Two passwords control access to your Home 
folder when FileVault is active:
 ✓ The Master Password can unlock any 
Home folder for any user. Only someone 
with an admin account can set the Master 
Password. The Master Password must be 
set before you can turn on the FileVault 
feature for any account on your system.
 ✓ Your Login Password unlocks your Home 
folder.
Personally, I love this feature, and I use it on 
all my Macs running Snow Leopard. Yet, a risk 
is involved (insert ominous chord here). To wit: 
DO NOT forget your Login Password, and make 
doggone sure that your Admin user remembers 
that all-important Master Password! Mac OS 
X displays a dire warning for anyone who’s 
considering using FileVault: If you forget these 
passwords, you can’t retrieve any data from 
your Home folder. Period. As Jerry Reed says, 
“It’s a gone pecan.”
So you like your privacy . . .

3. Click the square Picture well to specify the thumbnail image that 
appears in the Login list next to the account name.
 
 Apple provides a number of good images in the preview collection — 
just click a thumbnail to select it.
 
4. To add your own picture, click Edit Picture. You can drag a new image 
from the Finder or iPhoto into the icon placeholder, or click Choose to 
select one from an Open File dialog; then click Set.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Take a Video Snapshot button to grab a 
picture from your MacBook’s iSight video camera. Most cool.
 
5. After you make the changes (and you select just the right image to cap-
ture the user’s personality — a more difficult task than you might think), 
press Ô+Q to save them and close the System Preferences window.
Deleting an existing account
To wipe an account from the face of the Earth, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the account that you want to delete in the Accounts list.
 
2. Click the Delete User button (which is smartly marked with a 
minus sign).
 
 Mac OS X displays the confirmation sheet that you see in Figure 5-3.
 
Figure 5-3:

 Note that the contents of the user’s Home folder can be saved in a disk 
image in the Deleted Users folder (just in case you need to retrieve 
something). Alternatively, you can choose to leave the deleted user’s 
home folder as is, without removing it.

 If you’re absolutely sure you won’t be dating that person again, click 
the Delete the Home Folder option (which doesn’t save anything in the 
Deleted Users folder). You regain all the hard drive space that was being 
occupied by the contents of the deleted user’s home folder.
 
3. Click OK to verify and delete the account. Click the Cancel button to 
abort and return to the Accounts list.

Administrators are special people. Just ask one; you’ll see. Anyway, when an 
administrator creates or edits the account for a standard-level user, Mac OS 
X offers a number of levels of specific rights — Parental Controls — that can 
be assigned on an individual account basis. When an account has Parental 
Controls assigned, it becomes a managed account.
Parental Controls are available only for standard-level users; administrators 
aren’t affected by them because an administrator-level account already has 
access to everything covered by Parental Controls.
When do you need Parental Controls? Here are three likely scenarios:
 
✦ You’re creating accounts for corporate or educational users, and you 
want to disable certain features of Mac OS X to prevent those folks from 
doing something dumb. Just tell ’em you’re streamlining the operating 
system. (Yeah, that’s it.) For example, you might not want that one par-
ticular kid making CD copies of The Illustrated Anarchist’s Cookbook in 
the classroom while you’re gone. Therefore, you disable the ability for 
that account to burn CDs or DVDs.
 
✦ In the same environment, you might want to give a specific standard-
level account the ability to administer printers. If Roger in Accounting 
is both helpful and knowledgeable — oh, and add trustworthy in there, 
too — you might want to give him this capability so that he can handle 
the print queues while you’re on vacation.
 
✦ You want one or more users to access one — and only one — application 
on the system, or perhaps just two or three applications. To illustrate: In 
my years as a hospital hardware technician, we had a number of comput-
ers that were used solely to display patient records. No Word, no e-mail, 
nothing but the one program that accessed the medical records data-
base. We called these machines dumb terminals although they were 
actually personal computers. (This trick also works well if you’re a 
parent and you want to give your kids access without endangering your 
valuable files. Just don’t call your computer a dumb terminal lest your 
kids take offense. That’s experience talking there.) If you want to allow 
access to a specified selection of applications, you can set them in that 
account’s Controls.

Setting Parental Controls
Time to review what each of the settings does. To display the controls for a 
standard account, click the account in the list and then click the Open Parental 
Controls button. Click the Enable Parental Controls button, and click the 
Lock icon in the lower-left corner to confirm your access (if necessary). Snow 
Leopard includes five different categories of controls, as shown in Figure 5-4:
 
Figure 5-4: 
You can 
restrict 
access 
to many 
functions 
within a 
Standard 
account.
 
 
✦ System: These settings (which I discuss in more detail in a second) 
affect what the user can do within Snow Leopard as well as what the 
Finder itself looks like to that user.
 
✦ Content: These settings control the Dictionary and Safari applications. 
If you prefer that profane terms be hidden within the Dictionary for this 
user, click the Hide Profanity in Dictionary check box to enable it. Snow 
Leopard also offers three levels of control for Web sites:
 
• Allow Unrestricted Access: Select this radio button to allow unfettered 
access for this user.
 
• Try to Limit Access: You can allow Safari to automatically block Web 
sites it deems adult. To specify particular sites that Snow Leopard 
should allow or deny, click the Customize button.
 
• Allow Access to Only These Websites: Choose this radio button to 
specify which Web sites the user can view. To add a Web site, click 
the Add button (which bears a plus sign) — Snow Leopard prompts 
you for a title and the Web site address.

276
Tightening Your Security Belt
 
✦ Mail & iChat: Click the Limit Mail and Limit iChat check boxes to specify 
the e-mail and instant messaging addresses that this user can communi-
cate with. (Note that this affects only Apple Mail and iChat, so other mail 
clients, Web-based mail, and instant messaging applications aren’t con-
trolled.) To add an address that the user can e-mail or chat with, click 
the Add button.
 
 Do you want a notification if the user is attempting to send an e-mail to 
someone not in the list? Click the Send Permission Requests To check 
box to select it and then type your e-mail address in the text box.
 
✦ Time Limits: Parents, click the Time Limits button, and you’ll shout 
with pure joy — check out the options on this pane in Figure 5-5! You 
can limit an account to a certain number of hours of usage per weekday 
(Weekday Time Limits), limit to a specified number of hours of usage 
per weekend day (Weekend Time Limits), and set a bedtime computer 
curfew time for both weekdays and weekend days. (Note that vacations 
and school holidays aren’t recognized within Time Limits, so you’ll have 
to manage them manually!)

Leopard 
keeps track 
of your kid’s 
computer 
usage 
so that 
you don’t 
have to.
 
 
✦ Logs: Snow Leopard keeps a number of different types of text log files 
(which track where the user goes on the Internet, which applications are 
launched by the account, and the contents of any iChat conversations 
where the user was a participant). From this central pane, you can 

Book III
Chapter 5
Setting Up 
Multiuser Accounts
277
Tightening Your Security Belt
monitor all the logs for a particular account. Note that these logs are 
enabled or disabled from other locations within Snow Leopard: For 
example, the log showing the Web sites visited and blocked is enabled 
from the Content pane that I describe a little earlier, whereas the appli-
cations log is enabled when on the System pane. iChat logging is turned 
on from the Preferences dialog within the iChat application.
 
You can always tell whether an account has been assigned Parental Controls 
because the account description changes from Standard to Managed in the 
Accounts list.
Of particular importance are the System controls. Click the System tab to 
modify these settings:
 
✦ Use Simple Finder: I discuss the Simple Finder in the following section 
because it’s a great idea for families and classrooms with smaller children.
 
✦ Only Allow Selected Applications: When this option is selected, you 
can select the specific applications that appear to the user. These 
restrictions are in effect whether the user has access to the Full Finder 
or just the Simple Finder.
 
 To allow access to all the applications of a specific type — iLife, iWork, 
Internet, Widgets, Other, and Utilities — click the check box next to the 
desired group heading to select it. To restrict access to all applications 
within a group, click the check box next to the heading to deselect it. 
You can also toggle the restriction on and off for specific applications 
in these groups; click the triangle icon next to each group heading to 
expand the list and then either mark or clear the check box next to the 
desired applications. (If you see a minus sign in the check box, some 
subordinate items are selected.) To locate a specific application, click in 
the Search box and type the application name.
 
 To add a new application to the Allow list, drag its icon from the Finder 
and drop it in the list within the Other group. After you add an applica-
tion, it appears in the Other group, and you can toggle access to it on 
and off like the applications in the named groups.
 
✦ Can Administer Printers: With this check box selected, the user can 
modify the printers and printer queues within the Print & Fax pane in 
System Preferences. If this option is disabled, the user can still print to 
the default printer and switch to other assigned printers but can’t add 
or delete printers or manage the Mac OS X print queue.
 
✦ Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Deselect this check box to prevent the user 
from recording CDs or DVDs via the built-in disc recording features in the 
Mac OS X Finder. (Note, however, that if you load a third-party recording 
program, such as Toast, the user can still record discs with it.)

278
Tightening Your Security Belt
 
✦ Can Change Password: Select this check box to allow the user to change 
the account password.
 
 If you’re creating a single standard-level account for an entire group of 
people to use — for example, if you want to leave your laptop in kiosk 
mode in one corner of the office or if everyone in a classroom will use 
the same account on the machine — I recommend disabling the ability 
to change the account password. (Oh, and please do me a favor . . . don’t 
create a system with just one admin-level account that everyone is sup-
posed to use! Instead, keep your one admin-level account close to your 
bosom and create a standard-level account for the Unwashed Horde.)
 
✦ Can Modify the Dock: Select this check box, and the user can remove 
applications, documents, and folders from the Dock in the Full Finder. 
(If you don’t want the contents of the Dock changing according to the 
whims of other users, it’s a good idea to deselect this check box.)
Assigning the Simple Finder
You can restrict your standard-level users even further by assigning them 
the Simple Finder set of limitations. The default Simple Finder, as shown in 
Figure 5-6, is a highly simplified version of the regular Mac OS X Finder. The 
simplified Dock contains only the Finder icon, the Trash, and the folders for 
the user’s approved applications, documents, and shared files.
 
Figure 5-6: 
Whoa! It’s 
the Simple 
Finder — 
less filling; 
still runs 
great!

Using Keychains — NOT
This is the network administrator’s idea of a foolproof interface for Mac OS 
X: A user can access only those system files and resources needed to do a 
job, with no room for tinkering or goofing off.
 
A Simple Finder user can still make the jump to the full version of the Finder 
by clicking Finder and choosing Run Full Finder. The user has to enter a cor-
rect admin-level username and password.
 
You can also change the Auto Login account from the Accounts pane. 
Click the Login Options button under the Accounts list and then click the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu to choose the account that automatically logs 
in when Mac OS X starts up. Enter the account password on the confirma-
tion sheet that appears and click OK. Although I’ve made it clear elsewhere 
that Automatic Login is not a good security feature in many cases (such as 
when you’re on the road with a laptop), it can be a good feature for those 
preparing a MacBook for public use. If you set the Automatic Login to your 
public standard-access account, Mac OS X automatically uses the right 
account if the MacBook is rebooted or restarted.
Don’t forget, you can always choose Log Out from the Apple menu to log in 
under your own account.
Using Keychains — NOT
Before I leave this chapter, I want to discuss a Mac OS X feature that’s been 
around since the days of Mac OS 8: the keychain. Your account keychain 
stores all the username/password combinations for Web sites, file servers, 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers, and the like, allowing you to simply 
waltz in and start using the service (whatever it is). Sounds handy, doesn’t 
it? And it can be, but you had better watch your step.
I’m perfectly honest here: I hate account keychains. With a passion, mind 
you. As a consultant, Webmaster, and the SYSOP (an ancient Bulletin 
Board Service acronym meaning System Operator) of an Internet-based 
online system, I know what a hassle it is for users to remember separate 
passwords, and I feel that pain. (I use separate passwords for everything.) 
However, three massively big problems are inherent with using keychains:
 
✦ Anyone can log on as you. If your keychain is unlocked, which happens 
automatically when you log in, all someone has to do is sit at your desk, 
visit a site or connect with a server, and bam! They’re on. As you. Think 
about that. And then think how many times you get up from your desk, 
just for a second, to grab another Diet Coke or a doughnut.
 
✦ You’ll forget your passwords. If the keychain file is corrupted — and it 
can happen — your passwords have gone to Detroit without you. Either 

280
Using Keychains — NOT
you’ve got them on paper hidden somewhere, they’re on your recent 
backup, or it’s time to change your online persona.
 
✦ Keychains need yet another stinkin’ password. Yep, that’s right — your 
keychain can be locked (either manually or, with the right settings, auto-
matically), and you have to remember yet another password/passphrase 
to unlock your keychain. “When, oh when will the madness end?”
 
From a security standpoint, keychains should be completely off-limits for 
anyone who’s interested in maintaining a well-locked-down machine. After all, 
most folks can completely take care of all their Internet and network connec-
tions with a handful of passwords, and that’s no big deal for anyone to remem-
ber. Unfortunately, Snow Leopard creates a keychain automatically for every 
user, so you have to monitor (and delete) your keychain data manually. (Sigh.)
However, if you’re the only person using your MacBook and it resides in 
your home — personally, I’d prefer a bank vault — and you absolutely 
must use keychains, you can display them all for the current account from 
the Keychain Access application (see Figure 5-7), conveniently located in 
Utilities within your Applications folder. Click the Category tab and then 
click an item in the keychain list to display or edit all its information.
 
Figure 5-7: 
Take my 
advice — 
stay away 
from the 
allure of the 
keychain.
 
 
Heck, just think about what I just wrote — anyone can display and edit server 
and site information just by launching this application! That includes your 
nephew Damien — you know, the one who considers himself the hacker 
extraordinaire. (While I’m at it, I should mention that it’s just as bad to set 
the Automatic Login feature — which I discuss earlier in this chapter — to

Using Keychains —NOT
an admin-level account. One reboot, and you’re rolling out the red carpet for 
the little rascal. For the inside information on Automatic Login, visit Chapter 4 
in this very minibook.)
To help lock things down — at least when it comes to your Internet 
communications — follow this path:
 
1. To display your Internet passwords, click the Passwords category 
(upper-left).
 
2. Click each Internet password to select it in the list and then click the 
lowercase i button at the bottom of the window to display the informa-
tion on that password.
 
3. Click the Access Control tab to display the settings that you see in 
Figure 5-8, one of which I strongly recommend.
 
 To minimize the damage that someone can do with this password, you 
can select the Confirm before Allowing Access radio button. And for 
yet another level of security, select the Ask for Keychain Password 
check box.
 
 Of course, you’re probably thinking, “Well, Mark, that pretty much 
eliminates the purpose of quick, convenient access without passwords, 
doesn’t it?” Yes, indeed it does, but at least your online identity is some-
what safeguarded.
 
 Click the plus sign button at the bottom of the Keychain Access window 
to add a new password. Type a name for the item, the username that 
you typically type to gain access, and the password for that server or 
site. Then click Add and cross your fingers.

282
Using Keychains — NOT
To display all the keychains you can access, choose Edit➪Keychain List. To 
create a brand-new keychain, choose File➪New Keychain. Mac OS X prompts 
you for the filename for your new keychain file. In the New Keychain dialog 
that appears, enter a catchy name in the Save As text box. By default, the 
keychain file is created in the Keychains folder — a good idea — but if you 
want to store it elsewhere, click the down-arrow button next to the Where 
list box and navigate to the desired folder. When you’re ready, click the 
Create button. Now you need to enter yet another password, type it again to 
verify it, and click OK.
To lock or unlock your login keychain, click the Lock icon at the top-left of 
the Keychain Access window. (Unlocking your keychain requires you to 
enter your login password. Go figure.)
You might be saying to yourself, “Geez, this guy is more than a little para-
noid.” And yes, dear reader, I suppose I am. But then again, who’s been 
uploading all those questionable images and MP3 files to the company 
server . . . using your account?

Chapter 6: Sharing Documents 
for Fun and Profit
In This Chapter
✓ Comparing network sharing with multiuser sharing
✓ Setting and changing permissions
✓ Sharing documents in Microsoft Office 2008 for the Mac
N
ow here’s a topic that MacBook power users can sink their teeth 
into — the idea that a document on a multiuser system can be every-
one’s property, allowing anyone in your family, workgroup, or highly com-
petitive mob to make whatever changes are necessary, whenever they like.
Of course, potential pitfalls lurk — even in the Apple world, there’s no such 
thing as an operating system that’s both powerful and perfectly simple. 
However, I think you’ll find that our dear friends from Cupertino have done 
just about as well as can be expected and that the settings that you use to 
share documents are fairly easy to understand and use.
Prepare to share!
Sharing over a Network versus 
Sharing on a Single Mac
First, allow me to clear up what I’ve found to be a common misconception 
by using another of Mark’s Maxims.
 
Sharing documents on a single computer is fundamentally different from 
the file sharing that you’ve used on a network.
True, multiple users can share a document over a network, which is a topic 
that I cover in Book VII. But although the results are the same, the way that 
you share that same document on a single machine betwixt multiple users is 
a completely different turn of the screw. In this section, I discuss the factoids 
behind the matter.

284
Sharing over a Network versus Sharing on a Single Mac
No network is required
Although reiterating that no network is required is seemingly the most obvi-
ous of statements, many otherwise knowledgeable Mac OS X power users 
seem to forget that sharing a document over a network requires an active 
network connection. (Note the word active there.) Unless you physically 
copy the document to your hard drive — which defeats the purpose of docu-
ment sharing — any loss of network connectivity or any problem with your 
network account will result in a brick wall and a brightly painted sign read-
ing, “No luck, Jack.” (Or perhaps it’s flashing neon.)
On the other hand, a document shared on a multiuser MacBook in the home 
or classroom is available whenever you need it. As long as the file is located 
in the Shared folder, the file privileges are set correctly, and you know 
the password (if one is required by the application, such as a password-
protected Word document), then — as they say on “Star Trek” — “You have 
the conn” whether your network connection is active or not.
Relying on a guaranteed lock
Sharing documents over a network can get a tad hairy when multiple users 
open and edit the document simultaneously. Many applications, such as 
Office 2008 for the Mac, have methods of locking the document (giving one 
person exclusive access) when someone opens it or saves it. However, you 
always face the possibility that what you’re seeing in a shared network docu-
ment isn’t exactly what’s in the document at that moment.
A multiuser system doesn’t need such exquisite complexity. You’re the one 
sitting at the keyboard, and you have control: This is what network adminis-
trators call a guaranteed lock on that document file. Refreshing, isn’t it?
But wait! Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes a feature called Fast User 
Switching — I discuss it in Book II, Chapter 2 — that allows other users to 
remain logged in behind the scenes while another user is at the keyboard. 
Therefore, if you enable Fast User Switching, two users could have the same 
document open at the same time. To prevent this, you can simply turn off 
Fast User Switching from the Accounts pane in System Preferences. (Click 
Accounts, click Login Options, and clear the Enable Fast User Switching 
check box.)
 
It’s also possible for someone to use Snow Leopard’s Remote Login feature 
to login to their account across the Internet. You can disable this feature by 
opening the System Preferences window, clicking the Share icon, and dese-
lecting the Remote Login check box.
Most places are off-limits
Network users are often confident that they can blithely copy and move a 
document from one place to another with the greatest of ease, and that’s

Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
true. Most shared network documents created by an application — such 
as a project outline created in Word, for example — carry their own shar-
ing information and document settings internally. Thus, you can move that 
same file to another folder on your hard drive, and the rest of the network 
team can still open it. (Um, if they have the network rights to access the new 
folder, of course.)
This isn’t the case when it comes to multiuser documents. As you can read in 
Chapters 4 and 5 of this minibook, Mac OS X places a rather tight fence around 
a standard-level user, allowing that person to access only the contents of cer-
tain folders. In this case, your document must be placed in the Shared folder 
for every standard-level user to be able to open it. (Alternatively, the docu-
ment can be stored on an external hard drive, allowing every user account on 
your system to access it.) If everyone using the document has administrator 
access, you can store the file in other spots on your system; as long as the per-
missions are set, you’re set. And speaking of permissions . . .
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
Files are shared in Mac OS X according to a set of rules called permissions, 
the ownership of the file (typically the person who saved the document the 
first time), and an access level specified as a group. The combination of privi-
leges, ownership, and group determines who can do what with the file.
When you (or the person with the administrator account on your MacBook) 
created your user account, you were automatically granted ownership of 
your Home folder and everything that it contains as well as any files or fold-
ers that you store in the Shared folder or another user’s Public folder.
Four possible actions are allowed through permissions:
 
✦ Read Only: This action allows the user to open and read the file, which 
includes copying it to another location.
 
✦ Read & Write: This permission grants full access to the file, including 
opening, reading, editing, saving, and deleting. Read & Write permission 
also allows the user to copy or move the file to another location.
 
✦ Write Only (Drop Box): A neat permission setting that appears only 
with a folder — it allows access to copy an item to the folder, but not to 
read any files it contains. (Hence the informal name Drop Box, and the + 
[plus sign] icon added to the folder’s icon to identify it.) For example, a 
drop box is made to order for teachers: Students can submit homework 
by dragging their work to the teacher’s drop box.
 
✦ No Access: This is just what it sounds like — the user can’t open the file, 
copy it, or move it.

286
Permissions: Law Enforcement for Your Files
 
No matter what permissions you’ve set, only the System Administrator (or 
root user) can copy items into another user’s Home folder using the Finder. 
Take my word for it on this one: Simply consider that this can’t be done, and 
stay as far away from the Root/System Administrator account as possible. 
(I repeat: Trust me on this.) Read all about the perils of enabling the System 
Administrator account in Chapter 4 of this minibook.
These permissions are set in the Info dialog for a file or folder (always accessi-
ble by pressing Ô+I). If you’re setting the permissions for a folder, you can also 
elect to apply those same settings to all the enclosed items within the folder.
To set permissions, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the item to select it, press Ô+I (or choose Finder➪File), and then 
choose the Get Info menu item.
 
 If you have a mouse or trackball with a right button, you can right-click 
the item and choose Get Info instead. Either way, Mac OS X displays the 
Info dialog.
 
2. Click the right-facing arrow next to the Sharing & Permissions head-
ing to expand it, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
 Because I selected a folder, the Apply Enclosed Items button appears at 
the bottom of the section.
 
3. To change your own permissions on the item, click the Privilege 
pop-up menu and choose a new Ownership permissions level.
 
 This is likely set to Read & Write, and it’s a good idea to leave it alone. If 
you’re the file’s owner, you’re likely not a security risk.
 
 Perhaps I should be a little less tactful here: Never choose an access 
level for yourself other than Read & Write without being absolutely sure 
of what you’re doing, because you can potentially prevent yourself from 
accessing or deleting the file in the future! For example, if you simply 
want to lock an item to prevent changes being made, don’t set your 
Ownership permission to Read Only. (Instead, select the Locked check 
box in the General section of the Info dialog instead . . . you can easily 
clear the Locked check box later to make changes to the item.)
 
4. To change permissions for someone else or a group, click the Privilege 
value for that user or group and then choose the appropriate value 
from the pop-up menu.
 
 Assigning permissions for an entire group is a good idea for limiting 
specific files and folders to only Administrator access. (Note, however, 
that Snow Leopard reserves the group name wheel for internal tasks, so 
never alter any permissions for the wheel group.)
 
5. If necessary, set the permission for the Everyone pop-up menu (other-
wise known as “I’m going to lump everyone else into this category”).
 
 If a user isn’t the owner of an item and doesn’t fit into any group that you’ve 
selected, this access permission setting for this file applies to that user.

Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
 
Figure 6-1:

dialog,

Sharing & 
Permissions.
 
 
 If you’re setting permissions for a folder, Snow Leopard can automati-
cally change the permissions for all the items contained in the folder to 
the same settings. Click the Action pop-up menu button at the bottom 
of the Info dialog (which bears a gear symbol) and choose Apply to 
Enclosed Items. Mac OS X displays a confirmation dialog.
 
 Generally, it’s a good idea not to override the permissions for all the items in 
a folder, so use the Apply to Enclosed Items function only when necessary.
 
6. After all the permissions are correct, click the Close button to save 
your changes and return to your friendly Finder.
If a specific user or group doesn’t appear already in the Privilege list, click the 
Add button (bearing the plus sign) and you can add a specific privilege level 
for that user or group. You can also delete a privilege level: Click the desired 
entry to select it and click the Delete button (which bears a minus sign).
Permission and Sharing Do’s and Don’ts
After you get the basics of sharing files and assigning permissions under 
your belt, you need to master when to change permissions and why you 
should (and shouldn’t) modify them. Follow these common-sense guidelines 
when saving documents, assigning permissions, and choosing access levels:
 
✦ Do use your Shared folder. The Shared folder is the center of proper doc-
ument sharing. I know there’s a strong urge to create a new document in 

288
Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
your Home folder, but you’re just making more work for yourself because 
you’ll end up copying that document from your Home folder to the Shared 
folder. Instead of an extra step, store a document that’s intended to be 
shared in the Shared folder — where it belongs in the first place.
 
✦ Don’t assign permissions just to protect a file from deletion. 
Remember, if all you need to do is prevent anyone (including yourself) 
from deleting an item, you don’t need to go to all the trouble of changing 
permissions. Instead, just display the Info dialog for the item and select 
the Locked check box to enable it, which prevents the item from being 
deleted from the Trash until the Lock status is disabled.
 
✦ Do review the contents of a folder before changing permissions for 
enclosed items. That confirmation dialog doesn’t appear just for kicks. 
For example, if you set a highly sensitive, private document with per-
missions of No Access for everyone but yourself and then you apply 
less-restrictive permissions globally to the folder that contains the docu-
ment, you’ve just removed the No Access permissions, and anyone can 
open your dirty laundry. (Ouch.) Therefore, make sure that you open 
the folder and double-check its contents first before applying global per-
missions to the items it contains.
 
✦ Don’t change permissions in the Applications or Utilities folders. If 
you have Administrator-level access, you can actually change the per-
missions for important applications such as Mail, Address Book, iTunes, 
and Safari, as well as their support files. This spells havoc for all users 
assigned to the standard-access level. Be polite and leave the permis-
sions for these files alone.
 
✦ Definitely don’t change System ownership. Mac OS X is stable and reli-
able. Part of that stability comes from the protected state of the System 
folder, as well as a number of other folders on your hard drive. If you 
displayed the Info dialog for the System folder, you’ll see that the Owner 
is set to system, and the Group is set to wheel (a term from the UNIX 
world that encompasses all administrator accounts). Now, promptly 
close that Info dialog, without making any changes!
 
✦ Never, never, NEVER change any permissions for any files owned by 
the System unless specifically told to do so by an Apple support tech-
nician. Do NOT monkey with System-owned items.
 
 This last one is quite striking for a reason, so please heed the warning.
Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
Many Mac OS X applications offer their own built-in document-sharing fea-
tures. For example, Microsoft Office 2008 for the Mac includes both file-level 
and document-sharing features. Because Office 2008 is currently the most 
popular productivity suite available for Mac OS X, I discuss these commands 
in this final section.

Book III
Chapter 6
Sharing Documents 
for Fun and Profit
289
Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
Document-sharing features
You’ll find a number of commands that help multiple users keep track of 
changes that have been made in a shared Office document. Probably the 
most familiar is the Word revision tracking features (heavily used during the 
development of this book), but there are others as well:
 
✦ Revision marks: If several users edit a document, how can you tell 
who did what? By using revision marks, which apply different colors to 
changes made by different editors, those additions and deletions can be 
accepted or rejected individually at a later date. If Johnson in Marketing 
adds incorrect material, you can easily remove just his changes. In a 
worst-case scenario, you can actually reject all changes and return the 
document to its pristine condition.
 
✦ Compare Documents: Using this feature allows you to compare a 
revised document with the original (if, of course, you still have the origi-
nal file handy). I use Compare Documents only if revision marks weren’t 
turned on before editing began.
 
✦ Comments: Editors can also converse within a document by using 
embedded Comments. These don’t change the contents of the Word file 
the way revision marks do, but store commentary and notes in a behind-
the-scenes kind of way. (Think of a Mac OS X Sticky that appears within 
a document.) Again, the author of each comment is listed, allowing for 
(sometimes heated) communication within the body of a document.
 
✦ Highlighting: You’ve heard the old joke about . . . Well, anyway, a tradi-
tional highlighter marker is pretty useless on a computer monitor (leav-
ing a nasty mess for the next user to clean), but Word allows multiple 
highlighting colors for identifying text. (And for the occasional practical 
joke — nothing like adding eight different highlighting colors to that 
important proposal. Just make sure that your résumé is up-to-date.)
File-level sharing features
Along with the document-level sharing commands, you’ll find that Office 
2008 applications also offer sharing features that control access to the docu-
ment file itself.
Password protection
You can add password protection to any Office 2008 document. Follow these 
steps with a document created within Word, Excel, or PowerPoint:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As.
 
2. In the Save As dialog that appears, click Options to display the Save 
Preferences pane.

290
Sharing Stuff in Office 2008
 
3. Click the Show All toolbar button.
 
4. Click Security to display the Preferences pane that you see in Figure 6-2.
 
Figure 6-2: 
Office 2008 
offers two 
types of 
document 
passwords.
 
 
5. To password-protect the document, enter a password in the Password 
to Open field.
 
 This password must be provided when opening the document.
 
 If you like, you can enter another password in the Password to Modify 
field. This second password would then also be required to modify the 
document.
 
 Both passwords are case sensitive.
 
6. Click OK to save the preference changes and return to your document.
Document protection
Think of the Protect Document dialog in Word, from which you can effec-
tively write-protect certain elements, as an extra level of security in a 
multiuser environment. In this Office application, you can protect revision 
marks, comments, and sections of a document containing forms. A password 
can be added if desired. To display the Protect Document dialog, click Tools 
in any of the Office 2008 applications and choose Protect Document from the 
pop-up menu that appears.

In This Chapter
✓ Keeping your MacBook off-limits to prying eyes and hands
✓ Using a tracking application to monitor your MacBook
T
hroughout this minibook, I show you how you can easily share informa-
tion and files with others — all the while keeping your private files away 
from prying eyes, safe in your Home folder.
But, good reader, it’s time to recognize the unfortunate fact that many Mac 
owners put themselves at risk of identity theft (or loss of their MacBook). 
Unless you exercise common sense while using your MacBook, you could be 
the victim, waving goodbye to your personal and financial information.
In this security-conscious chapter, I discuss how to keep your MacBook 
safe . . . and even how to locate and monitor it remotely in case it is lost 
or stolen!
MacBook Security 101
Of course, your MacBook is a high-dollar (and highly portable) electronic 
device, making it a prime target for theft. Don’t forget, however, that with a 
few simple steps, you can also secure the data on your MacBook — both the 
data displayed on your screen and the information stored in your laptop’s 
hard drive!
In this section, I mention my favorite common-sense MacBook security 
tips — and yes, I follow every single one of these recommendations with my 
own MacBook Pro. (Security is King when it comes to my computers!)
Mark your MacBook
Put your brand on your laptop! Whether you do this using an engraving 
tool on the bottom of the machine (my personal favorite) or a permanent 
metal tag, your MacBook deserves some sort of identifying information. 

292
MacBook Security 101
(Forget the old standby, a business card taped to the bottom of the case. 
Your MacBook needs a more permanent brand.) After all, most of the people 
in the world are honest, and you might not need that tracking software that 
I mention later in this chapter. You might leave your laptop somewhere by 
accident, and someone would like to return it to you. (Don’t forget to offer a 
reward!)
Some laptop owners will want to include their name, address, and other con-
tact information, whereas other Road Warriors might feel more comfortable 
with just their name and e-mail address. Whatever you choose, branding 
your laptop is as important as backing it up.
Use those doggone passwords
This is security at its most basic. Without a strong login password and 
screen saver password, your MacBook is essentially a sitting duck — and 
not just to those thieves who would steal your laptop but also to those 
casual sets of prying eyes that can read an inopportune e-mail or see too 
much of a private company spreadsheet.
With both a login password in place and FileVault security turned on (which 
I discuss a bit later in this chapter), you may still lose your MacBook to out-
right theft, but your personal information and your data will likely never be 
compromised!
Screen saver hot corners equal instant privacy
Tucked away in the Desktop & Screen Saver pane in System Preferences is 
the Hot Corners button, which lets you specify a corner of the screen that 
will immediately activate your screen saver. Using the Hot Corners feature 
means that just a quick swipe of the finger to the selected corner of your 
trackpad brings instant security from prying eyes, no matter what applica-
tion you’re using.
I’m reminded of a close friend who once dropped by his manager’s office 
and was asked to report on company sales performance. Through no fault 
of his own, my friend couldn’t help but notice the open memo displayed on 
the manager’s widescreen monitor, which listed co-workers who would be 
downsized within the month. A fast switch to a screen saver would have pre-
served the privacy of that memo. (Luckily, my friend wasn’t on the list.)
Buy a security cable, and use it
As a kid, did you lock your bike whenever you left it behind? I certainly 
didn’t — and luckily, my bike was never stolen, but I certainly gave thieves 

Book III
Chapter 7
Common-Sense 
Laptop Security
293
MacBook Security 101
every opportunity to try their luck. Funny thing is, as an adult I lock my 
bikes religiously! Chalk it up to an enhanced dose of common sense and an 
adult’s appreciation of the cost of a replacement.
Friends, the exact same common-sense rule applies to your MacBook: Buy 
a security cable and use it to keep your laptop safe from theft. Oh, and you 
don’t have to search for a bike rack to lock down your MacBook — I’ve used 
table legs, tree trunks, and wrought-iron fencing to secure my MacBook, 
depending on how long I’m away. (Of course, if someone’s around that you 
can trust to monitor your laptop, your cable can remain in your backpack. 
But as long as you’re prepared, you’ll never have to leave your MacBook 
unsecured!)
Avoid the Obvious Laptop Case
Sure, using a laptop case or bag sounds like common sense — but MacBooks 
are so doggone sexy that you’d be surprised how many people carry them 
around without any protection at all. These Mac owners hear phrases like 
“rugged aluminum unibody” and “Sudden Motion Sensor hard drive protec-
tion” and figure that their laptop can tackle a construction site, a college 
campus, or a hotel room with impunity.
Part of that is indeed true. Mac laptops are some of the toughest laptops 
ever made, but they’re not immune to bumps, scratches, and the (I hope) 
rare fall. But if you carry your MacBook from place to place without any 
protection, it’ll soon look like a boxer after a bad fight.
Many folks think that a traditional laptop bag draws too much attention — 
and to some extent, I agree. (That’s one reason no one totes an obvious 
15 x 7 bag with a hardware manufacturer’s logo emblazoned on the side 
these days.) If you’re a member of this group, consider a well-padded laptop 
sleeve that will allow you to carry your MacBook in your backpack or brief-
case; the laptop always goes in on top of those heavy books, of course. 
Remember, though, that the padding is the important thing. Without that 
extra cushion, you might as well just toss your unprotected laptop in with 
the rest of your books and must-have equipment.
Encryption is your friend
In Book III, Chapter 3, I discuss a number of System Preferences panes. The 
Security pane is particularly important to laptop users because it allows you 
to encrypt your Snow Leopard Home folder. Encryption prevents just about 
anyone from accessing (or even identifying) any of the files you’ve stored in 
your Home folder. The robust encryption provided by Snow Leopard will cer-
tainly stymie just about anyone but the NSA and FBI. (I won’t even go there.)

294
MacBook Security 101
In System Preferences, click Security, click the FileVault tab, and then click 
Set Master Password to create a backup password that will unlock your 
Home folder, just in case. (Your login account password is your primary 
password.) Select Turn On FileVault, and Snow Leopard takes care of auto-
matically encrypting and unencrypting files as necessary.
 
To take full advantage of an encrypted Home folder, you need the proper 
login mode (as I discuss in Book III, Chapter 4). Think about this possible 
security backdoor: From the Accounts pane, you’ve set your laptop to auto-
matically log you in every time you boot your MacBook. This is the very 
definition of Not Secure because your login account password automatically 
bypasses the FileVault encryption! Therefore, make sure that you actu-
ally have to log in to access your account. For the full scoop, see Book III, 
Chapter 5.
Unsecured Wireless is . . . unsecured
Okay, I like free Internet access as much as the next technology author — 
it’s cool, it’s convenient, and public access wireless networks keep popping 
up more and more all over the world. My favorite example? New Orleans 
has upgraded to citywide free wireless Internet access, which is perfect for 
checking your e-mail whilst you’re catching beads or listening to jazz. Many 
more cities are certain to follow in the near future.
However, just because something is free doesn’t mean that it’s safe. 
(Impromptu bungee jumpers, take note.) Unfortunately, the free public wire-
less access you’re likely to encounter is not secure: Anyone can join, and the 
information you send and receive can be intercepted by any hacker worthy 
of the name. A public network uses no WEP or WPA key, so no encryption 
is involved, and therefore no guarantee that your private e-mail, your com-
pany’s financial spreadsheets, and your Great American Novel aren’t being 
intercepted while you’re uploading and downloading them in the airport.
 
If you must use your laptop on an unsecured public network, make sure that 
the connection itself is secure instead. For example, don’t check your e-mail 
using a Web browser unless your ISP or e-mail service offers an encrypted 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connection. (Yep, I’m talking again about that 
little padlock that appears in Safari, which I discuss in Chapter 5 of Book VI. 
It’s not just for ordering things online!)
If you need to establish a secure connection with your home or office net-
work, use an SSL-enabled Virtual Private Network (VPN) client, which allows 
you to transfer files and remotely operate a host computer with bulletproof 
security.

Using a Security Application
Using a Security Application
The unthinkable happens: Your MacBook is stolen while you’re on vacation 
or on a business trip, and you know that the chances that it will be returned 
are next to nil. You’ve resigned yourself to replacing it (and all your data). 
But wait! What if I told you that you might just receive an e-mail message on 
your desktop computer that tells you the Internet (IP) address of the thief or 
perhaps even the address where he or she is staying?
If this scenario sounds a little like a James Bond movie, you’ll be surprised to 
learn that several tracker applications are available for Mac OS X that will run 
invisibly on your laptop. A tracker application can turn your MacBook into 
a transmitting beacon, broadcasting its current location and all the Internet 
information it can get to you — allowing you to alert police and apprehend 
the crook (who might be in the middle of creating an iPhoto library).
For example, MacTrak from GadgetTrak (www.gadgettrak.com) invisibly 
sends an e-mail to you each time your laptop is connected to the Internet. 
The e-mail outlines the network environment and physical location of your 
MacBook, using WiFi positioning. (Heck, your MacBook even takes surveil-
lance photos using its iSight camera and then uploads those images to your 
Flickr account!)
MacTrak costs about $30 per year, which is pocket change for a corporate 
Road Warrior or design professional who depends on both the laptop and 
the irreplaceable data it contains.

Chapter 1: The World 
According to Apple
In This Chapter
✓ Doing things the hub way
✓ Digitizing your life
✓ Making your digital devices work together
H
uzzah! After years of empty promises of professional-quality media 
features for home and school — most of them coming from those silly 
Windows people in Redmond — Apple has developed a recipe for digital 
success.
By using tightly integrated hardware and software (where everything works 
smoothly together), Apple gives you the ability to easily organize and 
produce your own multimedia with the iLife suite of digital tools, which 
includes iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, GarageBand, iWeb, and iTunes. That same 
software also provides fantastic editing capabilities. Finally (and this is very 
important) — to paraphrase Will Smith in the movie Men in Black, “Apple 
makes these programs look good.”
First, Sliced Bread . . . and Now, the Digital Hub
In today’s overloaded world of personal electronic devices, people can try 
to juggle as many as five or six electronic wonders. Each device typically 
comes with its own software, power adapter, and connectors to the outside 
world. Although managing one or two devices isn’t terribly difficult, as the 
number of devices increases, so do the headaches. When you have a half-
dozen cables, power adapters, and software to cart around, the digital life 
can become pretty bleak. (And quite heavy. You’ll need more than a back-
pack to lug all that gear around.)
To combat this confusion, Apple came up with the idea of a digital hub, 
whereby your MacBook acts as the center of an array of electronic devices. 
By using standardized cables, power requirements, built-in software, and 
even wireless connections via Bluetooth (the standard for short-range 
wireless communications between devices) and 802.11x wireless (for con-
nections to your Ethernet network and your Apple TV unit), the MacBook — 
along with its operating system, Mac OS X — goes a long way toward simpli-
fying your interaction with all the electronic gadgets that you use.

What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Given the hub terminology, think of the digital hub as a wagon wheel. (See 
Figure 1-1.) At the center of the wheel is your MacBook. At the end of each 
spoke is a digital device. Throughout the rest of Book IV, I give you the 
skinny on each device, but this chapter gives you the overview and tells you 
how they all work together.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Hey, look 
what’s in 
the center 
of your 
digital hub!
 
What Does Digital Mean, Anyway?
Computers are handy machines. They can process information very quickly 
and never get bored when asked to do the same task millions of times. The 
problem is that despite their propensity for reliability and speed, they aren’t 
so hot in the intuition department. You have to tell them how to do every-
thing (and most of them talk only to application developers and program-
mers). Computers know only one thing — numbers — although they do 
know numbers very, very well.
In fact, binary (the language of computers) has only two values — one and 
zero, which represent on and off, respectively. (Think of a light switch that 
toggles: The earliest computers were simply banks of switches that filled up 
an entire room.) To work with a computer in meaningful ways, you have to 
describe everything to a computer with numbers — or, if you prefer, digits.

What Can I Digitize?
By describing audio in numerical digits, you suddenly have something that 
a computer can work with. Toss a computer as many numbers as you want, 
and it can handle them. The scientists who figured this out knew that they 
had a good thing going, so they proceeded to convert anything that they 
could get their hands on into . . . well, digits. (Sorry about the atrocious 
pun.) Anyway, this resulted in some interesting technologies, most of which 
you’ll surely recognize:
 
✦ Audio CDs: The music is represented as numbers and is stored on a 
plastic disc.
 
✦ Digital video: Images and sound are stored together on your hard drive 
or a DVD as one really, really long string of numbers.
 
✦ Digital fingerprints: (No pun intended this time.) Your fingerprint is 
converted into numerical data, which a computer can use to compare 
against fingerprint data from other people.
 
✦ Automated telephone operators: When you call a phone operator these 
days, you often aren’t speaking to a real person. Rather, the computer 
on the other end of the line converts your voice into digits, which it 
uses to interpret your words. (At other times, I think I’m talking to a real 
person, but it’s hard to tell.)
What Can I Digitize?
As you’ve probably guessed by now, practically anything can be digitized. As 
long as you can represent something as numbers, you can digitize that data. 
Whether it’s photographs, video, or audio, your MacBook is adept at digitiz-
ing data and processing it.
Photographs
Perhaps the most popular of digital devices, the digital camera has trans-
formed photography forever. By using sophisticated electronics, digital cam-
eras convert the image that you see through the camera viewfinder into an 
image made purely of numbers.
After this numeric information is transferred to your MacBook, your com-
puter can cut, twist, fade, label, and paint your digital images. Because 
numbers are the only materials involved, you won’t need scissors, paint, or 
adhesive tape to edit images. (Advertising photographers can say good-bye 
to the old-fashioned airbrush.) Your laptop does it all by manipulating those 
numbers. It cuts down on the messy art supplies and gives you the com-
fort of being able to go back in time — something that anyone who’s not so 
handy with scissors can appreciate.

The Software That Drives the Hub
Music
As I mention earlier in this chapter, audio CDs are one application of music 
represented as digital data. The physical CD is just a piece of plastic with a 
metal coating, but you don’t even really need CDs any longer. Your MacBook 
can digitize audio for storage on your hard drive, too, which brings up 
another important point. Not only is digital information palatable to a com-
puter, it’s also very portable. You can store it on any number of storage 
devices, such as an iPod, a USB flash drive, or an external hard drive. (By the 
way, if you’re a musician, you can use GarageBand and external instruments 
that will turn your mobile Mac into a combination of synthesizer, amplifier, 
and backup band. Mozart would’ve loved this stuff.)
Video
When you photograph a scene multiple times per second and then replay 
the sequence, you get (tah-dah!) moving pictures. In the analog (as opposed 
to digital) world, this would be a strip of celluloid film or magnetic tape. In 
the digital world, such a sequence of photographs is called DV, or digital 
video. After you take your digital video, you can transfer that data to your 
MacBook to further manipulate it: You can edit it and add transitions, text, 
and other effects.
DVD
As is a CD-ROM or a hard drive, a DVD is simply a means of storing digital 
data. Although you can use it to save many different kinds of data, its most 
common use is for presenting video content. The MacBook digital hub can 
produce DVDs by using any digital information you give it.
The Software That Drives the Hub
At the heart of your digital hub is your MacBook. To use and manipulate all 
the data that arrives at your laptop, your computer needs software, which 
provides instructions on what to do with the information that you send. For-
tunately, Apple has fashioned some of the most attractive and easy-to-use soft-
ware ever written to help you manipulate and manage your digital lifestyle — 
and that outstanding software accompanies your new MacBook as part of 
your purchase! The list of software that belongs to the digital hub includes
 
✦ iPhoto: Use iPhoto to download, manipulate, and organize your favorite 
digital photographs. After everything is just so, iPhoto can print them, 
burn them to disc, or even help you design and order a hardbound 
album! (For way more on iPhoto, go to Book IV, Chapter 3.)
 
✦ iTunes: iTunes offers the ability to create and manage your music and 
movie collection, along with sundry other media such as podcasts, 

Book IV
Chapter 1
The World 
According to Apple
303
The Software That Drives the Hub
Internet radio, audiobooks, and music videos. You can also purchase 
and download audio tracks and video from Apple’s iTunes Store. iTunes 
can even burn CDs! (Head to Book IV, Chapter 2 for more.)
 
✦ iMovie: Every film director needs a movie-editing suite. iMovie gives 
you the chance to set up Hollywood in your neighborhood coffee shop 
with outstanding results. (Just keep that double mocha away from your 
laptop!) For more, see Book IV, Chapter 4.
 
✦ iDVD: As home video moves toward the digital realm, iDVD becomes 
an essential tool for authoring your own DVD media. Home movies will 
never be the same! iDVD is covered in Book IV, Chapter 5.
 
✦ GarageBand: Call it a “music-building” application! Even if you can’t play 
a note, GarageBand makes it easy to create your own original songs — 
and if you are a musician, you can turn your MacBook into a traveling 
production studio. The latest version can even help you learn how to 
play an instrument. (Turn to Book IV, Chapter 6 for more.)
 
✦ iWeb: Interested in producing a professional-quality Web site, but afraid 
that you’ll have to give up your personal life to build and maintain it? 
Never fear; with iWeb you can join the Web publishing crowd the easy 
Apple way. (I cover iWeb like a blanket in Book IV, Chapter 7.)
 
✦ iCal: To help keep your hectic digital lifestyle in order, iCal (which 
is included with Snow Leopard) offers complete calendar features. 
Besides tracking your dates and appointments on your MacBook, you 
can publish calendars on the Web or share them with different parts of 
the digital hub. (Or, if you have an iPod, you can even download your 
appointments and carry ’em with you.)
 
✦ iSync: With so many digital devices at your disposal, it gets hard to keep 
them all straight. iSync is software for automatically synchronizing con-
tact and calendar information between cell phones, your personal digital 
assistant (PDA), an iPod, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal. iSync is 
included with Snow Leopard.
iPhoto
What good is a camera without a photo album? iPhoto, Apple’s photogra-
phy software, serves as a digital photo album. Use it to help you arrange 
and manage your digital photos. Beyond its functions as a photo album, 
iPhoto also gives you the ability to touch up your images through cropping, 
retouching, scaling, rotating, and red-eye reduction (photographically speak-
ing, not morning-after speaking).
Besides offering editing features, iPhoto also works automatically with your 
digital camera. Simply plug in the camera to your MacBook’s Universal Serial 
Bus (USB) port, and iPhoto knows it’s there. Need to transfer photos from 
the camera to your photo album? iPhoto can do that, too.

304
The Software That Drives the Hub
When you complete a collection of photographs that you find interesting, 
use iPhoto to help you publish them on the Internet or even to create your 
very own coffee-table book, custom greeting cards, and full-color calendars. 
(The latest in high-tech: paper products.) And for those of you who still want 
that nifty wallet print to show off at work or a poster to hang on your wall, 
you can print them with your own printer or order them online through 
iPhoto. Orders made with iPhoto show up in your mailbox — the U.S. Postal 
Service physical one outside your domicile — a few days later.
iTunes
To help you wrangle your enormous digital music and movie collection, 
Apple offers iTunes (see Figure 1-2). For starters, iTunes is a sophisticated 
audio player for all your digital audio files. But iTunes is also handy for con-
verting audio tracks from audio CDs to a number of popular digital audio 
file formats, such as AAC, MP3, and AIFF. After you import or convert your 
music into computer files, iTunes helps you manage and maintain your 
music collection. You can even listen to streaming online “radio stations,” 
24 hours a day. The latest version of iTunes even allows you to rent or buy 
videos and movies, either on your MacBook or on your video-capable iPod.
Plus, Apple throws in the iTunes Store, where you can preview hundreds of 
thousands of songs and videos for up to 30 seconds each without spending 
a dime. (Podcast subscriptions are usually free, bucko.) If you latch onto 
something that you’d like to buy, you can use your credit card to purchase 
and download your media (either as individual tracks for 99 cents each, or 
as a complete album or movie for a package price). After the media that 
you’ve bought is comfortably nestled in iTunes, you can play it on your 
laptop, burn music to an audio CD, or download it to your iPod.
Why do I keep harping on the iPod? Well, as a proud owner of one, I’m glad 
you asked: Apple’s iPod is a versatile, lightweight audio and video player 
with hidden extras that James Bond would covet. It has enough capacity 
to store your entire collection of music and several movies, but it’s small 
enough to fit into your shirt pocket. With iTunes, you can instantly exchange 
media between your MacBook and your iPod. You can also use iTunes to 
create audio and MP3 CDs for playback elsewhere. And the iPod even works 
as honest-to-goodness, back-up storage . . . you see, it also functions as a 
standard external USB 2.0 hard drive. An iPod can display text files and play 
games; you can even carry your Address Book contacts and iCal appoint-
ments with you with aplomb. (For the lowdown on iPod, peruse Book IV, 
Chapter 2.)
iMovie
You needn’t restrict yourself to still images: Hook up your digital camcorder 
to your MacBook as well. Use iMovie, the easy-to-use video editing applica-
tion shown in Figure 1-3, to create and edit digital movies.

With stunning video-editing candy such as transitions, sound effects, and 
video effects, iMovie turns your home movies into professional productions 
that you’ll be proud to share with friends and family. Finally, you can have a 
home-movie night without putting everyone to sleep.
iDVD
Of course, after you create a video masterpiece, you probably want to save 
it on a DVD for preservation and future viewing. To help you in your endeav-
ors, use iDVD to create — or, as video professionals call it, author — DVD 
movies. With the preset templates, iDVD will have you cranking out stunning 
DVDs with interactive menus in no time, ready to use with any DVD player.
GarageBand
Imagine the freedom to create your own original music by simply dragging 
“digital instruments” onto a canvas . . . and then adding your own voice as 
the lead instrument! After the basic melody is in place, you’ll be able to edit 
whatever you like, or even choose different instruments with the click of a 
mouse. As recently as ten years ago, dear reader, that concept was indeed 
just a dream. Then, software-based synthesizers and mixing applications 
brought musicians into the digital age. (The problem was that normal human 
beings couldn’t afford the expensive software or the sample libraries of liter-
ally thousands of different instruments.) With the addition of GarageBand, 
however, the iLife suite provides everything that you need to start making 
your own music (inexpensively) and then create MP3 files or burn your own 
audio CDs. And believe me, if I can create a techno track that actually hit the 
speakers at a local dance club, you can, too!
iWeb
In the days of old — I’m talking five or six years ago here — putting a Web 
site online meant hours of drudgery, usually with a so-called “what you see 
is what you get” page creation application. Problem was, “what you saw” 
was very rarely easy to create, and if you were actually successful in get-
ting the results you wanted, you still had to get all that stuff to appear on 
a Web server somewhere so that visitors could actually see it. With iWeb, 
the creation of a Web site is intuitive, easy, and downright fun! Click and 
drag your way to the Web site you want, starting with a number of truly out-
standing predesigned templates. Add all sorts of cool pages, such as blogs 
and automated online photo albums. And the best part? Click a couple of 
buttons, and your new work of online art appears automatically on your 
MobileMe Web site, or as a group of files that’s ready for uploading to your 
Web server. Voilà!

Can I Use All This Stuff at One Time?
Can I Use All This Stuff at One Time?
What makes the digital hub idea even juicier is that it’s an interoperable 
model. Let’s pause to appreciate that. (What, you don’t speak engineer? No 
problem!) In plain English, the digital hub allows you to use digital media 
from one part of the hub with another part of the hub. Thus, the individual 
parts of the digital hub can work together to complement each other. To 
illustrate, consider some digital-sharing scenarios:
 
✦ You shoot a great photograph of your kids. It’s so great, in fact, that 
you’d like to use it as the title screen of your family’s home movie. With 
the digital hub, you can use that same photograph in iMovie to create 
your home flick. When you’re done with that, transfer the whole thing to a 
DVD by using iDVD, and your masterpiece is safe for decades of viewing. 
One image just worked its way through three parts of the digital hub.
 
✦ You just recorded a catchy song with GarageBand. You add the song 
to the soundtrack of the music video that you’re creating with iMovie. 
Then you create a fancy opening menu and burn the finished project to 
DVD with iDVD to show prospective agents. Again, one piece of media 
has traveled through three parts of the digital hub!
 
✦ Your band becomes popular and starts to play some impressive gigs. 
To document your band’s rise to stardom, your friend films a concert 
with a DV camcorder. You use iMovie to transfer the video to your 
MacBook and create clips of your favorite performances of the concert. 
The clips are transferred over to the primo Web site you’ve created with 
iWeb, and your band’s Internet image takes off! After that, it’s a simple 
matter to author to DVD with iDVD, extract the audio from the video for 
use as an MP3 with iTunes, and grab an image from the video for a band 
scrapbook that you’re creating with iPhoto. Now you’ve attained honest-
to-goodness DHH (shorthand for Digital Hub Heaven). You’ve traversed 
the entire hub, easily sharing the media along the way.
 
Lest I forget, I should mention the other advantage of the digital hub: The 
media that you swap between all your “iApplications” remains in digital 
form, which is A Good Thing! In the previous example of shooting a concert, 
for instance, that concert footage remained practically pristine while it was 
being transferred to DVD, converted to MP3, pasted into your iPhoto album, 
or uploaded to your iWeb site. (Because some audio and video formats are 
compressed to save space, such as MP3, a purist will argue that you lost a 
little something. It ain’t much.) Unlike with archaic analog VHS tape, you 
don’t have to worry about whether your source is second generation — and 
you can forget degradation and that silly tracking control.

ood news! It’s time to throw out your Dad’s Hi-Fi from the early ’70s 
(you know, the one with the 4-inch speakers that you’re embarrassed 
to show your friends). Every installation of Mac OS X comes with the finest 
stereophonic gadget in town: a great audio application called iTunes. With 
iTunes, you can listen to your favorite songs and podcasts, organize your 
music collection, watch a video or a full-length movie, listen to radio sta-
tions from around the world, buy music and video online, burn CDs and 
DVDs, and much more! iTunes has so many features that you’ll soon find 
yourself wondering why you even own a stereo at all. In no time, you’ll be 
pondering how much new speakers with a subwoofer will cost for your 
MacBook.
In this chapter, I show you how to play audio CDs, podcasts, videos, and 
Internet radio, but that’s just the beginning. You discover how to use 
iTunes’ Library to get one-click access to any song in your collection. I 
even show you how to tune into Internet radio (and share your favorite 
songs with others on your network), burn audio CDs (if you have the neces-
sary hardware), plug in your iPod, and buy the latest hits from the iTunes 
Store. Heck, iTunes can even suggest new music for your library based on 
what you’re listening to now. (And I demonstrate how to make your iTunes 
window look just as good as your music sounds, with visualizations.)
Just in case, though, keep your Dad’s Hi-Fi . . . it might fetch a hefty sum as 
an antique on eBay.

What Can I Play on iTunes?
What Can I Play on iTunes?
Simply put, iTunes is a media player; it plays audio and video files. These 
files can be in any of many different formats. Some of the more common 
audio formats that iTunes supports are
 
✦ MP3: The small size of MP3 files has made them popular for file trading 
on the Internet. You can reduce MP3 files to a ridiculously small size 
(at the expense of audio fidelity), but a typical CD-quality, three-minute 
pop song in MP3 format has a size of 3–5MB.
 
✦ AAC: AAC (short for Advanced Audio Coding) is an audio format that’s 
very similar to MP3; in fact, AAC files offer better recording quality at the 
same file sizes. However, this format originally supported a built-in copy 
protection scheme that prevented AAC music purchased from iTunes 
from being widely distributed on Macs. (Luckily, this copy protection is 
no longer applied to iTunes tracks, and you can still burn protected AAC 
tracks to an audio CD, just as you can MP3 tracks.) The tracks that you 
download from the iTunes Store are in AAC format.
 
 The iTunes Store’s iTunes Plus tracks are also in AAC format, but these 
tracks are not copy-protected, and they’re encoded at a higher-quality 
256 Kbps rate.
 
✦ Apple Lossless: Another format direct from Apple, Apple Lossless 
format provides the best compromise between file size and sound qual-
ity: These tracks are encoded without loss of quality. However, Apple 
Lossless tracks are somewhat larger than AAC, so it’s generally the 
favorite of the most discerning audiophile for his or her entire music 
library.
 
✦ AIFF: The standard Macintosh audio format produces sound of the 
absolute highest quality. This high quality, however, also means that the 
files are pretty doggone huge. A typical pop song in AIFF format has a 
size of 30–50MB.
 
✦ WAV: Not to be outdone, Microsoft created its own audio file format 
(WAV) that works much like AIFF. It can reproduce sound at higher 
quality than MP3, but the file sizes are very large, very similar in size to 
AIFF files.
 
✦ CD audio: iTunes can play audio CDs. Because you don’t usually store 
CD audio anywhere but on an audio CD, file size is no big whoop.
 
✦ Movies and video: You can buy and download full-length movies, TV 
shows, music videos, and movie trailers from the iTunes Store . . . and, 
with an Apple TV unit connected to your home theater system, you can 
watch those movies and videos from the comfort of your sofa on the 
other side of your house.
 
✦ Podcasts: These audio downloads are like radio programs for your 
iPod — but iTunes can play and organize them, too. Some podcasts also 
include video and photos to boot.

Playing an Audio CD
 
✦ Ringtones: iPhone owners, rejoice! iTunes automatically offers to create 
ringtones for your iPhone from the tracks you’ve bought on the iTunes 
Store. (You can also create ringtones with GarageBand, using songs 
you’ve added to your iTunes library.)
 
✦ Audiobooks: No longer do you need cassettes or audio CDs to enjoy 
your spoken books — iTunes can play them for you, or you can send 
them to your iPod for listening on the go.
 
✦ Streaming Internet radio: You can listen to a continuous broadcast of 
songs from one of tens of thousands of Internet radio stations, with 
quality levels ranging from what you’d expect from FM radio to the full 
quality of an audio CD. You can’t save the music in iTunes, but it’s still 
great fun. (In fact, I run my own station . . . more on MLC Radio later in 
the chapter.)
Playing an Audio CD
Playing an audio CD in iTunes is simple. Just insert the CD in your computer’s 
disc tray or disc slot, start iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock, and click the 
Play button. (Note that your Mac might be set to automatically launch iTunes 
when you insert an audio CD.) The iTunes interface resembles that of a tra-
ditional cassette or CD player. The main playback controls of the iTunes are 
Play, Previous Song, Next Song, and the volume slider, as shown in Figure 2-1.

312
Playing Digital Audio and Video
Click the Play button to begin listening to a song. While a song is playing, the 
Play button toggles to a Pause button. As you might imagine, clicking that 
button again pauses the music. If you don’t feel like messing around with the 
trackpad, you can always use the keyboard. The spacebar acts as the Play and 
Pause buttons. Press the spacebar to begin playback; press it again to stop.
Click the Next Song button to advance to the next song on the CD. The Previous 
Song button works like the Next Song button but with a slight twist: If a song 
is currently playing and you click the Previous Song button, iTunes first 
returns to the beginning of the current song (just like an audio CD player). 
To advance to the previous song, double-click the Previous Song button. To 
change the volume of your music, click and drag the volume slider.
As with other Macintosh applications, you can control much of iTunes with the 
keyboard. Table 2-1 lists some of the more common iTunes keyboard shortcuts.

Playing Digital Audio and Video
In addition to playing audio CDs, iTunes can play the digital audio files that 
you download from the Internet or obtain from other sources in the WAV, 
AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and MP3 file formats. Enjoying a digital audio file is 
just slightly more complicated than playing a CD. After downloading or saving 
your audio files to your Mac, open the Finder and navigate to wherever you 
stored the files. Then simply drag the music files (or an entire folder of music) 
from the Finder into the Music entry in the iTunes Source list. (The added files 
appear in the Music section of your iTunes Library. Think of the Library as a 
master list of your digital media. To view the Music Library, select the Music 
entry in the left-hand column of the iTunes player, as shown in Figure 2-2. Go 
figure.) Heck, you can also drag a song file from a Finder window and drop it 
on the iTunes icon in the Dock, which adds it to your Music Library as well.

Figure 2-2: 
The Music

keeps track 
of all your

If you drop the file on top of a playlist name in the Source list, iTunes adds it 
to that particular playlist as well as the main Library. (More about playlists in 
a bit.)
To play a song, just double-click it in the Music list. Alternatively, you can 
use the playback controls (Play, Previous Song, and Next Song) that I dis-
cuss earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1).
 
The Source list of iTunes can list up to five possible sources for music:
 
✦ Library: This section includes Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, 
Audiobooks, iPod Games, and Radio. (Think Internet radio, which I dis-
cuss further in the section “iTunes Radio.”)
 
✦ Devices: If an iPod is connected, it appears in the list. (And yes, Virginia, 
other models of MP3 players from other companies will also appear in 
the list if they support iTunes.) If you load an audio CD, it appears in the 
Devices heading . . . anything from the Bee Gees to Fall Out Boy.
 
✦ Store: I discuss this later, in the section “Buying Digital Media the 
Apple Way.”
 
✦ Shared: If another Mac or PC on your local network is running iTunes 
and is set to share part or all of its library, you can connect to the other 

314
Playing Digital Audio and Video
computer for your music. (Shared music on another Mac appears as a 
separate named folder in the Source list.)
 
✦ Playlists: Think of playlists as folders you use to organize your music. 
(More on playlists later in this chapter.)
 
If you’ve invested in an Apple TV, it will appear in the list as well, allowing 
iTunes to share media with your Apple TV, which in turn sends it to your ED- 
or HD-TV.
Notice also that the Library lists information for each song that you add to 
it, such as
 
✦ Song Name: The title of the song
 
✦ Time: The length of the song
 
✦ Artist: The artist who performs the song
 
✦ Album: The album on which the song appears
If some of the songs that you’re adding don’t display anything for the title, 
album, or artist information, don’t panic; most MP3 files have embedded 
data that iTunes can read. If a song doesn’t include any data, you can always 
add the information to these fields manually. I show you how later, in the 
section “Setting or changing the song information manually.”
 
Clicking any of the column headings in the Library causes iTunes to reorder 
the Library according to that category. For example, clicking the Song Name 
column heading alphabetizes your Library by song title. I click the Time 
heading often to sort my Library according to the length of the songs. Oh, 
and you can drag column titles to reorder them any way you like (as long as 
the Name column remains at the far left of the named columns).
 
iTunes can display your Music Library in three ways: By default, the applica-
tion uses the list view you see in Figure 2-1, where each song is one entry. 
Click the second View button (at the top of the iTunes window) to group 
tracks together by album artwork in grid view. Click the third View button, 
and you’re browsing by album cover in cover flow view, complete with reflec-
tive surface!
Browsing the Library
After you add a few dozen songs to iTunes, viewing the Library can become 
a task. Although a master list is nice for some purposes, it becomes as 
cumbersome as an elephant in a subway tunnel if the list is very long. To 
help out, iTunes can display your Library in another format, too: namely, 
browsing mode. To view the Library in browsing mode, click the View menu 
and click the Show Browser item, or press the Ô+B keyboard shortcut.

Book IV

Playing Digital Audio and Video
The Browse mode of iTunes displays your library in a compact fashion, orga-
nizing your tunes into four sections:
 
✦ Genre
 
✦ Artist
 
✦ Album
 
✦ Song Name
Selecting an artist from the Artist list causes iTunes to display that artist’s 
albums in the Album list. Select an album from the Album list, and iTunes 
displays that album’s songs in the bottom section of the Browse window. 
(Those Apple software designers . . . always thinking of you and me.)
Finding songs in your Music Library
After your collection of audio files grows large, you might have trouble locat-
ing that Swedish remix version of “I’m Your Boogie Man.” To help you out, 
iTunes has a built-in Search function. To find a song, type some text into the 
search field of the main iTunes window. While you type, iTunes tries to find 
a selection that matches your search text. The search is quite thorough, 
showing any matching text from the artist, album, song title, and genre fields 
in the results. For example, if you type Electronic into the field, iTunes might 
return results for the band named Electronic or other tunes that you classi-
fied as electronic in the Genre field. (The section “Know Your Songs,” later 
in this chapter, tells you how to classify your songs by genre, among other 
options.) Click the magnifying glass at the left side of the Search field to 
restrict the search even more: by Artists, Albums, Composers, and Songs.
Novice iTunes users, take note: iTunes 
watches your back when you trash tracks.
To illustrate: Suppose you delete a song from 
the Library that’s located only in the iTunes 
music folder (which you didn’t copy into iTunes 
from another location on your hard drive). 
That means you’re about to delete the song 
entirely, and there’ll be no copy remaining on 
your MacBook at all. Rest assured, though, 
that iTunes prompts you to make sure that 
you really want to move the file to the Trash. 
(I get fearful e-mail messages all the time from 
readers who are loath to delete anything from 
iTunes because they’re afraid they’ll trash their 
digital music files completely.)
Remember: If you delete a song from the Library 
that also exists elsewhere on your hard drive 
(outside the reach of the iTunes music folder), 
it isn’t deleted from your hard drive. In fact, if 
you mistakenly remove a song that you meant 
to keep, just drag it back into iTunes from the 
Finder, or even from the Trash. ’Nuff said.
Will I trash my Count Basie?

Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Removing old music from the Library
After you spend some time playing songs with iTunes, you might decide that 
you didn’t really want to add 40 different versions of “Louie Louie” to your 
Library. (Personally, I prefer either the original or the cast from the movie 
Animal House.) To remove a song from the Library, click the song to select it 
and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.
 
You can also remove a song from the Library by dragging it to the Trash in 
your Dock.
Watching video
Watching video in iTunes is similar to listening to your music. To view your 
video collection, click one of these entries in the Source list:
 
✦ Movies
 
✦ TV Shows
If you select Movies or TV Shows, iTunes displays your videos as thumbnails 
or in cover flow view. Music videos appear as a smart playlist.
From your collection, you can
 
✦ Double-click a video thumbnail or an entry in the list.
 
✦ Drag a QuickTime–compatible video clip from the Finder window to 
the iTunes window. (These typically include video files ending in .mov 
or .mp4.)
iTunes plays video in the box below the Source list, within the iTunes window, 
in a separate window, or in full-screen mode, depending on the settings 
you’ve chosen on the General pane in the iTunes Preferences window. In 
full-screen mode, move your pointer to display a control strip at the bottom 
of the screen, sporting the standard slider bar that you can drag to move 
through the video (as well as a volume control and Fast Forward/Reverse 
buttons). You can also pause the video by clicking the Pause button.
Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: 
Organizing with Playlists
As I mention earlier, the iTunes Music Library can quickly become a fear-
somely huge beastie. Each Library can contain thousands upon thousands 
of songs: If your Library grows anywhere near that large, finding all the 
songs in your lifelong collection of Paul Simon albums is not a fun task.

Keeping Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists
Furthermore, with the Library, you’re stuck playing songs in the order that 
iTunes lists them.
To help you organize your music into groups, use the iTunes playlist feature. 
A playlist is a collection of some of your favorite songs from the Library. You 
can create as many playlists as you want, and each playlist can contain any 
number of songs. Whereas the Library lists all available songs, a playlist dis-
plays only the songs that you add to it. Further, any changes that you make 
to a playlist affect only that playlist, leaving the Library intact.
To create a playlist, you can do any of the following:
 
✦ Choose File➪New Playlist.
 
✦ Press Ô+N.
 
✦ Choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. This creates a new playlist 
and automatically adds any tracks that are currently selected.
 
✦ Click a song to select it; then click the Genius button at the lower-
right corner of the window. (The Genius button bears a striking “atom” 
symbol.) iTunes builds a playlist of songs that are similar in some 
way (typically by matching the genre of the selection or the beats per 
minute, but also based on recommendations from other iTunes mem-
bers). Note that your MacBook needs an Internet connection to create a 
Genius playlist, and the larger your music library the longer it will take 
iTunes to build your playlist.
 
✦ Click the iTunes DJ entry in the Playlist section at the left side of the 
window. iTunes delivers a random selection of songs taken from your 
iTunes Music Library — perfect for your next spontaneous party! You 
can change the order of the songs in the iTunes DJ playlist (known as 
Party Shuffle in older versions of iTunes), add songs from your Library, 
or delete songs that don’t fit the scintillating ambience of your gather-
ing. Enjoy!
 
✦ Click the New Playlist button in the iTunes window (the plus sign 
button in the lower-left corner). You get a newly created empty playlist 
(the toe-tappin’ untitled playlist).
All playlists appear in the Source list. To help organize your playlists, it’s 
a good idea to . . . well, name them. (Aren’t you glad now that you have 
this book?) For example, suppose that you want to plan a party for your 
polka-loving friends. Instead of running to your computer after each song 
to change the music, you could create a polka-only playlist. Select and 
start the playlist at the beginning of the party, and you won’t have to worry 
about changing the music the whole night. (You can concentrate on the 
accordion.) To load a playlist, select it in the Source list; iTunes displays the 
songs for that playlist.

318
Know Your Songs
The same song can appear in any number of playlists because the songs in a 
playlist are simply pointers to songs in your Music Library — not the songs 
themselves. Add and remove them at will to or from any playlist, secure in 
the knowledge that the songs remain safe in the Library. Removing a playlist 
is simple: Select the playlist in the Source list and then press Delete.
 
Removing a playlist doesn’t actually delete any songs from your Library.
Know Your Songs
Besides organizing your music into Elvis and non-Elvis playlists, iTunes gives 
you the option to track your music at the song level. Each song that you add 
Click the File menu and you’ll see the New 
Smart Playlist menu command. The contents of 
a smart playlist are automatically created from 
a specific condition or set of conditions that 
you set via the Smart Playlist dialog: You can 
limit the track selection by mundane things, 
such as album, genre, or artist; or you can get 
funky and specify songs that were played last, 
or by the date you added tracks, or even by the 
sampling rate or total length of the song. For 
example, iTunes can create a playlist packed 
with songs that are shorter than three minutes, 
so you can fill your iPod Shuffle with more 
stuff! Ah, but wait, you’re not limited to a single 
criterion. If you want to add another criterion, 
click the plus sign at the right side of the dialog 
and you get another condition field to refine 
your selection even further.
You can choose the maximum songs to add to 
the smart playlist, or limit the size of the playlist 
by the minutes or hours of play or the number 
of megabytes or gigabytes the playlist will 
occupy. (Again, great for automatically gather-
ing as much from your KISS collection as will fit 
into a specific amount of space on a CD or your 
iPod.) Mark the Live Updating check box for the 
ultimate in convenience. iTunes automatically 
maintains the contents of the smart playlist to 
keep it current with your conditions at all times 
in the future. (If you remove tracks manually 
from a smart playlist, iTunes adds other tracks 
that match your conditions.)
Now think about what all these settings mean 
when combined . . . whoa. Here’s an example 
yanked directly from my own iTunes library. 
I created a smart playlist that selects only 
those songs in the Rock genre. It’s limited to 
25 songs, selected by least often played, and 
live updating is turned on. The playlist is named 
Tracks I’ve Gotta Hear because it finds the 25 
rock songs (from my collection of 1,654 songs) 
that I’ve heard least often! After I listen to a 
song from this smart playlist, iTunes automati-
cally “freshens” it with another song, allowing 
me to catch up on the tracks I’ve been ignoring. 
Completely, unbelievably sweet — and another 
reason that iTunes is the best music player on 
Planet Earth!
Some playlists are smarter than others

Know Your Songs
to the Music Library has a complete set of information associated with it. 
iTunes displays this information in the Info dialog, including
 
✦ Name: The name of the song
 
✦ Artist: The name of the artist who performed the song
 
✦ Composer: The name of the astute individual who actually wrote the 
song
 
✦ Album Artist: The name of the artist responsible for a compilation or 
tribute album
 
✦ Album: The album where the song appears
 
✦ Grouping: A group type that you assign
 
✦ Year: The year the artist recorded the song
 
✦ BPM: The beats per minute (which indicates the song’s tempo)
 
✦ Track Number: The position of the song on the original album
 
✦ Disc Number: The original disc number in a multi-CD set
 
✦ Comments: A text field that can contain any comments on the song
 
✦ Genre: The classification of the song (such as rock, jazz, or pop)
You can display this information by clicking a song name and pressing 
Ô+I — the fields appear on the Info tab.
Setting the song information automatically
Each song that you add to the iTunes Music Library might have song infor-
mation included with it. If you add music from a commercial audio CD, 
iTunes connects to a server on the Internet and attempts to find the infor-
mation for each song on the CD. If you download a song from the Internet, 
it often comes with some information embedded in the file already; the 
amount of included information depends on what the creator supplied. (And 
believe me, it’s often misspelled as well — think Leenard Skeenard.) If you 
don’t have an Internet connection, iTunes can’t access the information and 
displays generic titles instead.
Setting or changing the song information manually
If iTunes can’t find your CD in the online database or someone gives you an 
MP3 with incomplete or inaccurate information, you can change the informa-
tion yourself — believe me, you want at least the artist and song name! To 
view and change the information for a song, perform the following steps:

320
Know Your Songs
 
1. Select the song in either the Music Library list or a Playlist.
 
2. Press Ô+I or choose File➪Get Info.
 
3. Edit the song’s information on the Info tab, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3: 
View and

Keep in mind that the more work you put into setting the information of 
the songs in your Music Library, the easier it is to browse and use iTunes. 
Incomplete song information can make it more difficult to find your songs in 
a hurry. If you prefer, you don’t have to change all information about a song 
(it just makes life easier later if you do). Normally, you can get away with set-
ting only a song’s title, artist, and genre. The more information you put in, 
however, the faster you can locate songs and the easier they are to arrange. 
iTunes tries to help by automatically retrieving known song information, but 
sometimes you have to roll up your sleeves and do a little work. (Sorry, but 
the DataElves are out to lunch.)
“What about cover art, Mark?” Well, I’m overjoyed that you asked! iTunes 
can try to locate artwork automatically for the tracks you select. (Note that 
adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.) 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired songs from the track list.
 
2. Click Advanced➪Get Album Artwork.

Ripping Audio Files
 
You can set iTunes to automatically attempt the addition of album artwork 
every time you rip tracks from an audio CD, or when you add songs without 
artwork to your Music Library. Click iTunes and choose Preferences; then 
click the Store button and click the Automatically Download Missing Album 
Artwork check box to enable it.
 
Want to manually add album covers to your song info? Select one (or all) of 
the songs from a single album in the track list, display the Info dialog, and 
click the Artwork tab. Now launch Safari, visit Amazon.com, and do a search 
on the same album. Drag the cover image from the Web page right into the 
Info dialog, and drop it on top of the “sunken square” image well. When you 
click OK, the image appears in the Summary pane, and you can display it 
while your music is playing by pressing Ô+G, or by pressing the Show or 
Hide Song Artwork button at the lower left of the iTunes window! (Note that 
adding large images can significantly increase the size of the song file.)
 
By the way, if you buy tracks or an album from the iTunes Store, Apple 
always includes album covers automatically. Thanks, Steve!
Ripping Audio Files
You don’t have to rely on Internet downloads to get audio files: You can 
create your own MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, AIFF, and WAV files from your 
audio CDs with iTunes. The process of converting audio files to different 
formats is called ripping. (Audiophiles with technical teeth also call this pro-
cess digital extraction, but they’re usually ignored at parties by the popular 
crowd.) Depending on what hardware or software you use, each has its own 
unique format preferences. For example, most iPod owners prefer MP3 or 
AAC files, but your audio CDs aren’t in that format. Being able to convert 
files from one format to another is like having a personal translator in the 
digital world. You don’t need to worry if you have the wrong format: You can 
simply convert it to the format that you need.
The most common type of ripping is to convert CD audio to AAC or MP3 
format. To rip MP3s from an audio CD, follow these simple steps:
 
1. Launch iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock.
 
 Alternatively, you can locate it in your Applications folder.
 
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences.
 
3. In the Preferences window that appears, click the General toolbar 
button.
 
4. Click the Import Settings button.
 
5. Choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu.

Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
 
6. Choose High Quality (160 Kbps) from the Setting pop-up menu and 
then click OK.
 
 This bit rate setting provides the best compromise between quality (it 
gives you better than CD quality, which is 128 Kbps) and file size (tracks 
you rip will be significantly smaller than “audiophile” bit rates such as 
192 Kbps or higher).
 
7. Load an audio CD into your MacBook.
 
 The CD title shows up in the iTunes Source list (under the Devices head-
ing), which is on the left side of the iTunes window. The CD track listing 
appears on the right side of the window.
 
 If iTunes asks you whether you want to import the contents of the CD 
into your Music Library, you can click Yes and skip the rest of the steps; 
however, if you’ve disabled this prompt, just continue with the remain-
ing two steps.
 
8. Clear the check box of any song that you don’t want to import from 
the CD.
 
 All songs on the CD have a check box next to their title by default. 
Unmarked songs aren’t imported.
 
 Notice that the Browse button changes to Import CD.
 
9. After you select the songs that you want added to the Library, click 
the Import CD button.
Tweaking the Audio for Your Ears
Besides the standard volume controls that I mention earlier in this chapter, 
iTunes offers a full equalizer. An equalizer permits you to alter the volume of 
various frequencies in your music, allowing you to boost low sounds, lower 
high sounds, or anything in between. Now you can customize the way your 
music sounds and adjust it to your liking.
To open the Equalizer (as shown in Figure 2-4), do one of the following:

Equalizer

✦ Choose Window➪Equalizer.
 
✦ Press Ô+Option+2.
The Equalizer window has an impressive array of 11 sliders. Use the leftmost 
slider (Preamp) to set the overall level of the Equalizer. The remaining slid-
ers represent various frequencies that the human ear can perceive. Setting 
a slider to a position in the middle of its travel causes that frequency to 
play back with no change. Move the slider above the midpoint to boost that 
frequency; conversely, move the slider below the midpoint to reduce the 
volume of that frequency.
Continue adjusting the equalizer sliders until your music sounds the way 
you like it. When you close the Equalizer window, iTunes remembers your 
settings until you change them again. In case you prefer to leave frequen-
cies to the experts, the iTunes Equalizer has several predefined settings to 
match most musical styles. Click the pop-up menu at the top of the Equalizer 
window to select a genre.
After you adjust the sound to your satisfaction, close the Equalizer window 
to return to the iTunes interface and relax with those funky custom notes 
from James Brown.
A New Kind of Radio Station
Besides playing back your favorite audio files, iTunes can also tune in 
Internet radio stations from around the globe. You can listen to any of a 
large number of preset stations, seek out lesser-known stations not recog-
nized by iTunes, or even add your favorite stations to your playlists. This 
section shows you how to do it all.
When choosing an Internet radio station, keep 
your Internet connection speed in mind. If 
you’re using a broadband DSL or cable con-
nection — or if you’re listening at work over 
your company’s high-speed network — you 
can listen to stations broadcasting at 128 
Kbps (or even higher). The higher the bit rate, 
the better the music sounds. At 128 Kbps, for 
example, you’re listening to sound that’s as 
good as an audio CD.
However, if you’re listening over a dial-up 
modem connection, iTunes can’t keep up with 
audio streaming at higher bit rates, so you’re 
limited to stations broadcasting at 56 Kbps or 
lower.
What’s with the numbers next 
to the station names?

iTunes Radio
Although it’s not a radio tuner in the strictest sense, iTunes Radio can locate 
virtual radio stations all over the world that send audio over the Internet — 
a process usually dubbed streaming amongst the “in” Internet crowd. iTunes 
can track down hundreds of Internet radio stations in a variety of styles with 
only a few clicks.
To begin listening to Internet radio with iTunes, click the Radio icon located 
beneath the Library icon in the Source list. The result is a list of more than 
20 types of radio stations, organized by genre.
When you expand a Radio category by clicking its triangle, iTunes queries a 
tuning server and locates the name and address of dozens of radio stations 
for that category. Whether you like Elvis or not-Elvis (those passing fads, 
like new wave, classical, or alternative), something’s here for everyone. The 
Radio also offers news, sports, and talk radio.
After iTunes fetches the names and descriptions of radio stations, double-
click one that you want to hear. iTunes immediately jumps into action, loads 
the station, and begins to play it.
Tuning in your own stations
Although iTunes offers you a large list of popular radio stations on the Web, 
it’s by no means comprehensive. Eventually, you might run across a radio 
station that you’d like to hear, but it’s not listed in iTunes. Luckily, iTunes 
permits you to listen to other stations, too. To listen to a radio station that 
iTunes doesn’t list, you need the station’s Web address.
In iTunes, choose Advanced➪Open Audio Stream (or press Ô+U). In the 
Open Stream dialog that appears (as shown in Figure 2-5), enter the URL of 
your desired radio station and then click OK. Within seconds, iTunes tunes 
in your station.
This particular technology author has a prefer-
ence for a certain hot Net jam spot: MLC Radio, 
the Internet radio station I’ve been running 
for several years now. I call my station a ’70s 
Time Machine because it includes hundreds 
of classic hits from 1970–1979, inclusive. You 
hear everything from “Rock and Roll Hoochie 
Koo” by Rick Derringer to “Moonlight Feels 
Right” by Starbuck. (Hey, I’m summing up a 
decade here, so be prepared for both Rush 
and the Captain and Tennille, too.) The station 
broadcasts at 128 Kbps (audio CD quality), so 
you need a broadband connection to listen. 
For the radio’s Internet address or help con-
necting to MLC Radio, visit my Web site at 
www.mlcbooks.com — and then follow the 
steps in the next section to add MLC Radio to 
your playlists!

Radio stations in your playlists
If you find yourself visiting an online radio station more than once, you’ll be 
glad to know that iTunes supports radio stations in its playlists. To add a 
radio station to a playlist from the Radio list, do the following:
 
1. Open the category that contains the station you want to add to your 
playlist.
 
2. Locate the station that you want to add to your playlist and drag it 
from the Radio list to the desired playlist on the left.
 
 If you haven’t created any playlists yet, see the section “Keeping Slim 
Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists” earlier in this 
chapter to find out how.
Adding a radio station that doesn’t appear in the Radio list is a bit trickier 
but possible nonetheless. Even though iTunes allows you to load a radio 
station URL manually by using the Open Stream command in the Advanced 
menu, it doesn’t give you an easy way to add it to the playlist. Follow these 
steps to add a specific radio station to a playlist:
 
1. Add any radio station from the Radio list to your desired playlist.
 
 Any station in the list will do, as you’ll immediately change both the sta-
tion’s URL and name to create your new station entry in the Playlist.

If you’re lucky enough (like me) to own an iPod, you’ll be happy to know that 
iTunes has features for your personal audio and video jukebox as well. iPods, 
Apple’s multimedia players, comprise an entire family of portable devices 
(ranging from $79 to about $299) that can hold anywhere from about 300 
songs to literally thousands of songs, as well as podcasts, photos, and video. 
This great gadget and those like it have become known worldwide as the pre-
ferred portable digital media player.
You connect your iPod to any Macintosh or Windows PC with USB 2.0 ports 
with the included cable. After the iPod’s connected, it automatically synchro-
nizes to the playlists in iTunes. The iPod and the iTunes software communi-
cate with each other and figure out what items are in your iTunes Library (as 
compared with the iPod Library). If they discover songs, podcasts, and video 
in your iTunes Library that are missing from your iPod, the items automati-
cally transfer to the iPod. Conversely, if the iPod contains stuff that’s no longer 
in iTunes, the iPod automatically removes those files from its drive.
 
Go back and reread that last sentence above about the iPod automatically 
removing files from its drive. (I’ll wait here.) Apple added this feature in 
an effort to be attentive to copyright concerns. The reasoning is that if you 
connect your iPod to your friend’s computer, you can’t transfer songs from 
the iPod to that computer. Of course, you could always look at it from the 
marketing perspective as a feature that makes sure your MacBook and iPod 
are always in total sync. Whatever the case, pay close attention and read all 
warning dialogs when connecting to a computer other than your own, or you 
might wipe out your iPod’s library.
The best thing I can say about the iPod and iTunes combination is . . . well . . . 
that there isn’t anything else to say about them. The auto-sync feature is so 
easy to use, you forget about it almost immediately. You can, however, auto-
sync only selected playlists, or manually sync if you prefer.
 
This chapter — even as long as it is — just can’t explain all the ins and outs 
of the iTunes/iPod relationship! For a complete look at both iTunes and the 
iPod, I can heartily recommend a fellow For Dummies book, iPod & iTunes 
For Dummies, 7th Edition, by Tony Bove (Wiley Publishing).

1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences to open the Preferences dialog.
 
2. Click Sharing.
 
3. Select the Share My Library on My Local Network check box.
 
4. Specify whether you want to share your entire library or only selected

5. If you want to restrict access to just a few people, select the Require 
Password check box; then type a password in the text box.
 
6. Click OK.
Your shared folder appears within the Source list for all iTunes users who 
enabled the Look for Shared Libraries check box on the same pane of their 
iTunes Preferences dialog. Note that the music you share with others can’t 
be imported or copied, so everything stays legal.
 
Want to change that frumpy default name for your shared media library to 
something more exotic, like “Dan’s Techno Beat Palace”? No problem — dis-
play the Preferences dialog again, but this time click the General button and 
click in the Library Name text box. Edit your network entertainment persona 
to your heart’s content.
If you’re using an AirPort Express portable 
wireless Base Station, you can ship your songs 
right to your Base Station from within iTunes,

After your AirPort Express Base Station is 
plugged in and you connect your home stereo 
(or a boombox, or a pair of powered stereo 
speakers) to the stereo minijack on the Base 
Station, you see a Speakers pop-up list button

Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Burning Music to Shiny Plastic Circles
Besides being a great audio player, iTunes is adept at creating CDs, too. iTunes 
makes the process of recording songs to a CD as simple as a few clicks. 
Making the modern version of a compilation (or mix) tape is easier than get-
ting a kid to eat ice cream. iTunes lets you burn CDs in one of three formats:
 
✦ Audio CD: This is the typical kind of commercial music CD that you buy 
at a store. Most typical music audio CDs store 700MB of data, which 
translates into about 80 minutes of music.
 
✦ Data CD or DVD: A standard CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is recorded with the 
audio files. This disc can’t be played in any standard audio CD player 
(even if it supports MP3 CDs, which I discuss next). Therefore, you can 
listen to these songs only by using your MacBook and an audio player, 
such as iTunes on a PC running Windows.
 
✦ MP3 CD: As does the ordinary computer CD-ROM that I describe, an 
MP3 CD holds MP3 files in data format. However, the files are arranged 
in such a way that they can be recognized by audio CD players that sup-
port the MP3 CD format (especially boomboxes, DVD players, personal 
CD players, and car stereos). Because MP3 files are so much smaller 
than the digital audio tracks found on traditional audio CDs, you can fit 
as many as 160 typical 4-minute songs on one disc. These discs can also 
be played on your MacBook via iTunes.
 
Keep in mind that MP3 CDs aren’t the same as the standard audio CDs that 
you buy at the store, and you can’t play them in older audio CD players that 
don’t support the MP3 CD format. Rather, this is the kind of archival disc 
that you burn at home for your own collection.
To begin the process, build a playlist (or select an existing playlist that you 
want to record). If necessary, create a new Playlist and add to it whatever 
songs you would like to have on the CD. (See the earlier section, “Keeping 
Slim Whitman and Slim Shady Apart: Organizing with Playlists,” if you need a 
refresher.) With the songs in the correct order, select the playlist. Click the 
Burn Disc button at the bottom of the iTunes window to commence the disc 
burning process. Click the desired recording format (again, usually Audio 
CD) in the Burn Settings dialog that appears.
 
To save yourself from sonic shock, I always recommend that you enable the 
Sound Check check box before you burn. iTunes will adjust the volume on 
all the songs on your audio CD so that they’ll play at the same volume level.
Ready to go? Click OK, and iTunes lets you know when the recording is

Feasting on iTunes Visuals
Feasting on iTunes Visuals
By now, you know that iTunes is a feast for the ears, but did you know that 
it can provide you with eye candy as well? With just a click or two, you can 
view mind-bending graphics that stretch, move, and pulse with your music, 
as shown in Figure 2-6.
To begin viewing iTunes visuals, choose View➪Show Visualizer (or press 
Ô+T). Immediately, most of your iTunes interface disappears and begins 
displaying groovy lava lamp-style animations (like, sassy, man). To stop the 
visuals, choose View➪Hide Visualizer (or press Ô+T again). The usual sunny 
aluminum face of iTunes returns.
You can also change the viewing size of the iTunes visuals in the View menu. 
From the View menu item, choose Full Screen (or press Ô+F). To escape 
from the Full Screen mode, poke the trackpad or press Esc.
 
You can still control iTunes with the keyboard while the visuals are zooming 
around your screen. See Table 2-1 earlier in this chapter for a rundown on 
common keyboard shortcuts.
The iTunes Visualizer has many hidden features. While viewing the 
Visualizer, press ? to see a list of hidden Visualizer settings.
iTunes offers a built-in backup feature for your 
media library — I told you this was the best 
media player ever designed!
Choose File➪Library➪Back Up to Disc to 
start the process. You can choose to back up 
your entire iTunes library and all your playlists 
(which I recommend) or just the content you’ve 
purchased from the iTunes Store. Personally, 
if I lost everything in my collection except for 
what I’ve bought from the iTunes Store, I’d be 
just as crushed. Back it all up, and you won’t 
be sorry.
Click Back Up, and iTunes will prompt you for 
blank CDs or DVDs. If you need to restore from 
your completed backup, just launch iTunes and 
load the first backup disc into your drive.
How often is often enough when it comes 
to backing up your content? That depends 
completely on how often your media library 
changes. The idea is to back up often enough 
so that you always have a recent copy of your 
media files close by.

But wait, more Easter eggs are to be found! Again, while viewing the 
Visualizer, press one of following keys:
 
✦ M: Changes the Visualizer pattern
 
✦ P: Changes the Visualizer color scheme
Press either of these keys repeatedly to cycle through the various patterns 
and color schemes lurking deep within the Visualizer. (Personally, I’m a 
random Visualizer guy . . . there are so many patterns and schemes, I just let 
my MacBook do all the work.)
Additionally, you’ll find third-party Visualizer plug-ins available for down-
loading on Apple’s Web site and other Mac-related download sites — heck, 
some even display lyrics, karaoke-style! Choose a different Visualizer plug-in 
from the View➪Visualizer menu item. (Call me old-fashioned, but I like the 
default, iTunes Visualizer).
Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
Before we wave goodbye to the happy residents of iTunes iSland, I won’t 
forget to mention the hottest spot on the Internet for buying music and

Buying Digital Media the Apple Way
video: the iTunes Store, which you can reach from the cozy confines of 
iTunes. (That is, as long as you have an Internet connection. If you don’t, it’s 
time to turn the page to a different chapter.) If you’re not in iTunes, go to 
www.apple.com/itunes/store.
Click the iTunes Store item in the Source list, and after a few moments you’re 
presented with the latest offerings. Click a link in the store list to browse 
according to media type, or click the Power Search link to search by song 
title, artist, album, or composer. The Back/Forward buttons at the top of 
the iTunes Store window operate much the same as those in Safari, moving 
you backward or forward in sequence through pages you’ve already seen. 
Clicking the Home button (which, through no great coincidence, looks like a 
miniature house) takes you back to the Store’s main page.
To display the details on a specific album, track, video, podcast, or audio-
book (whew), just click it. If you’re interested in buying just certain tracks 
(for that perfect road warrior mix), you get to listen to 30 seconds of 
any track — for free, no less, and at full sound quality. To add an item to 
your iTunes Store shopping cart, click the Add Song/Movie/Album/Video/
Podcast/Audiobook button (sheesh!). When you’re ready to buy, click the 
Shopping Cart item in the Source list and then click the Buy Now button. 
(At the time of this writing, tracks are usually 99 cents a pop, and an entire 
album is typically $9.99 . . . what a bargain! 
The iTunes Store creates an account for you based on your e-mail address, 
and it keeps secure track of your credit card information for future pur-
chases. After you use the iTunes Store once, you never have to log in or 
retype your credit card information again (as long as you’re logged in using 
your account).
The tracks and files that you download are saved to a separate playlist 
called Purchased. After the download is finished, you can play them, move 
them to other playlists, burn them to CD or DVD, share ’em over your net-
work, or ship them to your iPod, just as you can any other item in your 
iTunes Library.
You can also put the Genius button to work for you, in league with the 
iTunes store. Click the Show Genius Sidebar button at the lower-right corner 
of the iTunes window — it looks like an arrow inside a square — and iTunes 
displays the Genius Sidebar, where iTunes recommends music that you can 
buy on the iTunes Store that’s similar to the albums in your Music Library. 
Click the button again to banish the sidebar.
Remember all those skeptics who claimed that buying digital audio and 
video could never work over the Internet because of piracy issues and high 
costs? Well, bunkie, hats off to Apple: Once again, our favorite technology 
leader has done something the right way!

Book IV: Going Mobile with iLife

Chapter 3: Focusing on iPhoto
In This Chapter
✓ Importing pictures from your hard drive or digital camera
✓ Organizing images with iPhoto
✓ Tweaking the appearance of photographs
✓ Sharing photos with your friends
F
or years, the Macintosh has been the choice of professional photogra-
phers for working with digital images — not surprising, considering the 
Mac’s graphical nature. Apple continues this tradition with iPhoto, a pho-
tography tool for the home user that can help you organize, edit, and even 
publish your photographs. (It sports more features than a handful of Swiss 
army knives.) After you shoot your photos with a digital camera (or even 
scan images from original film prints), you can import them into iPhoto, edit 
them, and publish them. You’re not limited to photos that you take yourself, 
either; you can edit, publish, and organize all kinds of digital image files. You 
can even create a photo album and use the iPhoto interface to order a hand-
some soft- or hard-bound copy shipped to you.
In this chapter, I walk you through an overview of what iPhoto can do. After 
that, I give you a brief tour of the controls within iPhoto so that you can see 
what features are available to you, including features for managing, printing, 
and publishing your photos.
Delving into iPhoto
In Figure 3-1, you can see most of the major controls offered in iPhoto ’09. 
(Other controls automatically appear when you enter different modes; I 
cover them in upcoming sections of this chapter.)

Although these controls and sections of the window are covered in more detail 
in the following sections, here’s a quick rundown of what you’re looking at:
 
✦ Source list: This list of image locations determines which photos iPhoto 
displays.
 
• You can choose to display either your entire image library or just the 
last “roll” of digital images that you downloaded from your camera.
 
• You can create new albums of your own that appear in the source 
list; albums make it much easier to organize your photos.
 
• Photos can be grouped by Event (when they were taken), Faces (who 
appears in the photos), and Places (where photos were taken).
 
• You can create books, calendars, cards, and slideshows.
 
✦ Viewer: This pane displays the images from the currently selected 
photo source.
 
 You can drag or click to select photos in the Viewer for further tricks, 
such as assigning keywords and image editing.

✦ Create button: Click this button to add a new blank album, smart album, 
MobileMe gallery, book, calendar, card, or slideshow to your source list.
 
✦ Get Info button: Click this button to display information on the cur-
rently selected photos.
 
✦ Enter Full Screen button: Click this button to switch to a full-screen 
display of your photos. In full-screen mode, the images in the selected 
album appear in a filmstrip across the top of the screen, and you can 
click one to view that image using your Mac’s entire screen real estate. 
You can also use the same controls that I discuss later in this chapter 
for editing and adjusting images; just move the cursor to the top edge of 
the full-screen display to show the menu or to the bottom edge to show 
the editing toolbar.
 
✦ Play Slideshow: Select an event, album, book or slideshow in the Source 
list (or multiple images you’ve selected in the Viewer) and click this 
button to start a full-screen slideshow using those images.
 
✦ Search box: Click the button next to the Search text box to locate 
photos by specific criteria, or just click in the box and start typing to 
search by description and title.
 
✦ Toolbar buttons: This group of buttons selects an operation you want 
to perform on the images you’ve selected in the Viewer. (Note that the 
toolbar buttons you see may depend on your screen resolution.)
 
✦ Thumbnail Resize slider: Drag this slider to the left to reduce the size of 
the thumbnails in the Viewer. This allows you to see more thumbnails at 
one time, which is a great boon for quick visual searches. Drag the slider 
to the right to expand the size of the thumbnails, which makes it easier 
to differentiate details between similar photos in the Viewer.
Working with Images in iPhoto
Even a superbly designed image display and editing application, such as 
iPhoto ’09, would look overwhelming if everything were jammed into one 
window. Thus, Apple’s developers provide different operation modes (such 
as editing and book creation) that you can use in the one iPhoto window. 
Each mode allows you to perform different tasks, and you can switch modes 
at just about any time by clicking the corresponding toolbar button.
In this section, I discuss three of these modes — import, organize, and edit — 
and what you can do when you’re in them. Then I conclude the chapter with 
sections on publishing and sharing your images.
Import Images 101
In import mode, you’re ready to download images directly from your digital 
camera — as long as your specific camera model is supported in iPhoto. You 

336
Working with Images in iPhoto
can find out which cameras are supported by visiting the Apple iPhoto sup-
port page at www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/cameras.html.
Follow these steps to import images:
 
1. Connect your digital camera to your MacBook.
 
 Plug one end of a USB cable into your camera and the other end into 
your MacBook’s USB port, and prepare your camera to download 
images.
 
2. Launch iPhoto.
 
 Your MacBook will probably launch iPhoto automatically when your 
camera is detected, but you can always launch iPhoto manually by click-
ing its icon in the Dock (or or double-clicking it in your Applications 
folder).
 
3. Type an event name for the imported photos, such as Birthday Party 
or Godzilla Ravages Tokyo.
 
4. Type a description for the Event.
 
5. To allow iPhoto to automatically separate images into separate events 
based on the date they were taken, click the Autosplit Events after 
Importing check box to select it.
 
6. Click the Import All button to import your photographs from the 
camera.
 
 The images are added to your Photo Library, where you can organize 
them as you wish.
 
 To select specific images to import, hold down the Ô key and click each 
desired photo; then click Import Selected instead of Import All.
If you have a folder of images that you’ve col-
lected already on your hard drive, a CD, a DVD, 
an external drive, or a USB Flash drive, adding 
them to your library is easy. Just drag the 
folder from a Finder window and drop it into the 
source list in the iPhoto window. iPhoto auto-
matically creates a new album using the folder 
name, and you can sit back while the images 
are imported into that new album. iPhoto rec-
ognizes images in several formats: JPEG, GIF, 
RAW, PNG, PICT, PSD, PDF, and TIFF.
If you have individual images, you can drag 
them as well. Select the images in a Finder 
window and drag them into the desired album 
in the source list. To add them to the album 
currently displayed in the Viewer, drag the 
selected photos and drop them in the Viewer 
instead.
If you’d rather import images by using a stan-
dard Mac Open dialog, choose File➪Import to 
Library. Simplicity strikes again!
Importing images from your hard drive

7. Specify whether the images you’re importing should be deleted from 
the camera afterward.
 
 If you don’t expect to download these images again to another com-
puter or another device, you can choose to delete the photos from your 
camera automatically. This saves you a step, frees space for new photos 
and helps eliminate the guilt that can crop up when you nix your pix. 
(Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)
“What’s that about an Event, Mark?” After you download the contents of 
your digital camera, those contents count as a virtual Event in iPhoto — 
based on either the date that you imported them or the date they were 
taken. For example, you can always display the last images you imported by 
clicking Last Import. If you want to see photos from your son’s graduation, 
they appear as a separate Event. (Both of these organizational tools will 
appear in the source list). Think about that . . . it’s pretty tough to arrange 
old-fashioned film prints by the moment in time that they document, but 
iPhoto makes it easy for you to see just which photos are part of the same 
group! I explain more about Events in the next section.
There are four methods of organizing photos: the album, which you may be 
familiar with from older versions of iPhoto, Events, Faces, and Places.
Organize mode: Organizing and sorting your images
In the days of film prints, you could always stuff another shoebox with your 
latest photos or buy another sticky album to expand your library. Your 
digital camera, though, stores images as files instead, and many folks don’t 
print their digital photographs. Instead, you can keep your entire collection 
of digital photographs and scanned images well ordered and easily retrieved 
by using iPhoto’s organize mode. Then you can display them as a slideshow, 
e-mail them, print them to your system printer, use them as Desktop back-
grounds, or burn them to an archive disc.
A new kind of photo album
The most familiar method of organizing images in iPhoto is the album. Each 
album can represent any division you like, be it a year, a vacation, your 
daughter, or your daughter’s ex-boyfriends. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new album.
 
 You can either choose File➪New Album or click the plus (+) button at 
the bottom of the source list. Click the Album button at the top of the 
sheet to display the settings you see in Figure 3-2.

338
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
Figure 3-2: 
Add a new 
album in 
iPhoto.
 
 
2. Type the name for your new photo album.
 
 If you want to create an empty album (without automatically includ-
ing any images that might be selected), make sure you click the Use 
Selected Items in New Album check box to deselect it.
 
3. Click OK.
iPhoto also offers a special type of album called a Smart Album, which you 
can create from the File menu. (For even faster action, hold down the Option 
key while you click the Add button.) A Smart Album contains only photos 
that match certain criteria that you choose, using the keywords and rating 
that you assign your images. Other criteria text in the photo filenames, dates 
the images were added to iPhoto, and any comments you might have added. 
Now here’s the really nifty angle: iPhoto automatically builds and maintains 
Smart Albums for you, adding new photos that match the criteria (and delet-
ing those that you remove from your Photo Library)! Smart Albums carry a 
gear icon in the source list.
You can display information about the currently selected item in the infor-
mation pane under the source list. Just click the Show Information button 

Book IV
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto
339
Working with Images in iPhoto
at the bottom of the iPhoto window, which sports the familiar “i-in-a-circle” 
logo. You can also type a short note or description in the Description box 
that appears in the Information pane. For more in-depth information, select 
the desired item and then press Ô+I.
 
You can also change information on an image by selecting it in the Viewer 
and clicking the Show Information button. Click any of the headings in the 
pane (Title, Date, Time, and so on) to display a text edit box, and you can 
simply click in either box to type a new name or alter the photo’s date 
stamp.
You can drag images from the Viewer into any album you choose. For exam-
ple, you can copy an image to another album by dragging it from the Viewer 
to the desired album in the Source list.
To remove a photo that has fallen out of favor, follow these steps:
 
1. In the source list, select the desired album.
 
2. In the Viewer, select the photo (click it) that you want to remove.
 
3. Press Delete.
 
When you remove a photo from an album, you don’t remove the photo 
from your collection (which is represented by the Photos entry under 
the Library heading in the source list). That’s because an album is just a 
group of links to the images in your collection. To completely remove 
the offending photo from iPhoto, click the Photos entry under the Library 
heading to display your entire collection of images and delete the picture 
there, too.
To remove an entire album from the source list, just click it in the source list 
to select it — in the Viewer, you can see the images that it contains — and 
then press Delete. (Alternatively, right-click or Control-click the offending 
album and choose Delete Album from the pop-up menu.)
To rename an album, click the entry under the Albums heading in the Source 
list to select it and then click again to display a text box. Type the new album 
name and press Return.
 
Change your mind? Daughter’s ex is back in the picture, so to speak? iPhoto 
comes complete with a handy-dandy Undo feature. Just press Ô+Z, and it’s 
as though your last action never happened. (A great trick for those moments 
when you realize you just deleted your only image of your first car from your 
Library.)

340
Working with Images in iPhoto
Arranging stuff by Events
As I mention earlier, Events are essentially a group of images that you shot 
or downloaded at the same time — iPhoto figures that those images belong 
together (which is usually a pretty safe assumption). Figure 3-3 illustrates 
some of the Events I’ve created in my iPhoto collection.
 
As can an album, an Event can be renamed — you just use a different proce-
dure. Click the Events entry under the Library heading in the Source list to 
display your Events in the Viewer; then click the existing Event name in the 
caption underneath the thumbnail. A text box appears in which you can type 
a new name; click Return to update the Event.
Try moving your cursor over an Event thumbnail in the Viewer and you’ll 
see that iPhoto displays the date range when the images were taken, as well 
as the total number of images in the Event. Ah, but things get really cool 
when you move your cursor back and forth over an Event with many images: 
The thumbnail animates and displays all the images in the Event, without 
your using old-fashioned scroll bars or silly arrows! (Why can’t I think of this 
stuff? This is the future, dear readers.)
 
Notice that “i-in-a-circle” that appears when you hover your cursor over an 
Event thumbnail? Click it to display the location where the shot was taken, 
using the Places feature I describe in a page or two.

341

To display the contents of an Event in the Viewer, just double-click the Event 
thumbnail. To return to the Events thumbnails, click the All Events button at 
the top of the Viewer.
 
Decided to merge those Prom Event pictures with your daughter’s 
Graduation Event? No problem! You could drag one Event thumbnail on 
top of another, but that’s the easy way. Alternatively, click the Events 
entry under the Library heading in the Source list to display your Events 
and then hold down Ô while you click the Events that you want to merge. 
Click the Merge button in the toolbar at the bottom of the window, or click 
Events➪Merge Events. (Forgot about that menu bar, didn’t you?) Click 
Merge in the confirmation dialog that appears. 
 
Whilst organizing, you can create a brand-new empty Event by clicking 
Events➪Create Event. Feel free to drag photos from albums, other Events, 
or your Photo library into your new Event.
Working with Faces and Places
iPhoto ’09 includes two new organizational tools called Faces and Places. 
These two categories now appear in the Library section of the Source list.
Putting names to faces:
First, let’s tackle Faces. This feature is a sophisticated recognition system 
that automatically recognizes human faces within the photos that you add 
to your Library. (I don’t know whether it works well with pets — but you can 
try, anyway.) Naturally, you have to identify faces first before iPhoto can rec-
ognize them, which it does through a process called tagging.
To tag a face, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Source list, click the Photos item to display your image library.
 
2. In the Viewer, click the photo with a person you want to tag.
 
 The photo is selected, as indicated by the yellow border.
 
3. Click the Name button in the iPhoto toolbar at the bottom of the 
window.
 
 iPhoto displays the tagging pane you see in Figure 3-4. Note that iPhoto 
has indicated each person’s face in the photo with a label.
 
4. If the face is unrecognized (labeled as unnamed), click the label to 
open a text box and type the person’s name.
 
 If iPhoto recognizes the face correctly and the name matches the 
person, click the check mark to confirm the tag. If the face is incorrectly 
identified, click the X and you can enter a new name.

342
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
Figure 3-4: 
Adding 
another 
mug to my 
collection of 
Faces.
 
 
 If the name appears on an Address Book contact card, you can click the 
matching entry that appears to confirm the identity. Wowzers!
 
 If iPhoto doesn’t recognize a face at all in the photo (which can happen 
if the person’s face is turned at an angle to the camera, or is in a darker 
area of the photo), click the Add Missing Face button, and iPhoto places 
a box in the center of the image. Drag the box over the person’s face. If 
necessary, you can resize the box using the four handles at the corner of 
the box. Now you can click the label and type the person’s name.
 
5. Press Return to save the face.
 
 Notice the expansion button that appears next to the person’s name? 
Click it, and iPhoto displays other photos that likely contain this per-
son’s face, allowing you to tag them there as well.
 
6. Click Done after you’ve identified all the faces in the photo.
After you’ve tagged an image, it appears in your Faces collection, which you 
can view by clicking the Faces entry in the Source list. You can click a por-
trait in your Faces collection to see all the images that contain that person. 
As you might expect, the more tags you add for a specific person, the better 
iPhoto gets at recognizing that person!

Book IV
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto
343
Working with Images in iPhoto
Putting photos in their place:
Places makes it easy to track the location where photos were taken, but 
it requires a digital camera that includes GPS tracking information in the 
image metadata. (This is a relatively new feature for digital cameras, so 
older models aren’t likely to support GPS tracking.) Places also requires an 
Internet connection, because it uses Google Maps.
Click the Places entry in the Source list to display a global map, with push-
pins indicating where your photos were taken. You can switch the Places 
map between terrain and satellite modes, or choose a hybrid display. If 
you’re familiar with Google Maps, these settings are old friends of yours.
Alternatively, click the List View button to display a character-based 
browser, where you can click on country, state, and city names.
No matter which view mode you choose, clicking a pushpin or location dis-
plays the images taken in that area.
Organizing with keywords
“Okay, Mark, albums, Events, Faces, and Places are great ideas, but there has 
to be a way to search my collection by category!” Never fear, good MacBook 
owner. You can also assign descriptive keywords to images to help you orga-
nize your collection and locate certain pictures fast. iPhoto comes with a 
number of standard keywords, and you can create your own as well.
To illustrate, suppose you’d like to identify your images according to special 
events in your family. Birthday photos should have their own keyword, and 
anniversaries deserve another. By assigning keywords, you can search for 
Elsie’s sixth birthday or your silver wedding anniversary (no matter what 
Event or album they’re in), and all related photos with those keywords appear 
like magic! (Well, almost like magic. You need to choose View➪Keywords, 
which toggles the Keyword display on and off in the Viewer.)
iPhoto includes a number of keywords that are already available:
 
✦ Favorite
 
✦ Family
 
✦ Kids
 
✦ Vacation
 
✦ Birthday
 
✦ Movie
 
✦ Checkmark

344
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
What’s the Checkmark all about, you ask? It’s a special case: Adding this 
keyword displays a tiny check mark icon in the bottom-right corner of the 
image. The checkmark keyword comes in handy for temporarily identifying 
specific images because you can search for just your checkmarked photos.
To assign keywords to images (or remove keywords that have already 
been assigned), select one or more photos in the Viewer. Choose Window➪
Show Keywords or press Ô+K to display the Keywords window, as shown in 
Figure 3-5.
 
Figure 3-5: 
Time to add 
keywords 
to these 
selected 
images.
 
Click the keyword buttons that you want to attach to the selected images 
to mark them. Or click the highlighted keyword buttons that you want to 
remove from the selected images to disable them.
Digging through your library with keywords
Behold the power of keywords! To sift through your entire collection of 
images by using keywords, click the magnifying glass button next to the 
Search box at the bottom of the iPhoto window and then choose Keyword 
from the pop-up menu. iPhoto displays a pop-up Keywords panel, and you 
can click one or more keyword buttons to display just the photos that carry 
those keywords.

Book IV
Chapter 3
Focusing on iPhoto
345
Working with Images in iPhoto
 
The images that remain in the Viewer after a search must have all the key-
words that you specified. If an image is identified, for example, by only three 
of four keywords you chose, it isn’t a match and it doesn’t appear in the 
Viewer. (You can create a Smart Album with specific keywords to get around 
this limitation.)
 
To search for a photo by words in its description, just click in the Search 
box and start typing. You can also click that same magnifying glass by the 
Search box to search through your images by date and rating as well. 
Speaking of ratings . . .
Playing favorites by assigning ratings
Be your own critic! iPhoto allows you to assign any photo a rating of any-
where from zero to five stars. I use this system to help me keep track of the 
images that I feel are the best in my library. Select one (or more) image and 
then assign a rating using one of the following methods:
 
✦ Choose Photos➪My Rating and then choose the desired rating from the 
pop-up submenu.
 
✦ Use the Ô+0 through Ô+5 shortcuts.
Sorting your images just so
The View menu provides an easy way to arrange your images in the Viewer 
by a number of different criteria. Choose View➪Sort Photos and then click 
the desired sort criteria from the pop-up submenu. You can arrange the dis-
play by date, keyword, title, or rating. If you select an album in the source 
list, you can also choose to arrange photos manually, which means that you 
I’ll bet you take photos of things other than just 
kids and vacations — and that’s why iPhoto 
allows you to create your own keywords. 
Display the iPhoto Keywords window by press-
ing Ô+K, click the Edit Keywords button, and 
then click Add (the button with the plus sign). 
iPhoto adds a new unnamed keyword to the list 
as an edit box, ready for you to type its name.
You can rename an existing keyword from this 
same window, too. Click a keyword to select it 
and then click Rename. Remember, however, 
that renaming a keyword affects all the images

be confusing when, for example, photos origi-
nally tagged as Family suddenly appear with 
the keyword Foodstuffs. To remove an exist-
ing keyword from the list, click the keyword to 
select it and then click the Delete button, which 
bears a minus sign.

can drag and drop thumbnails in the Viewer to place them in the precise 
order you want them.
 
Naturally, iPhoto allows you to print selected images, but you can also 
send photos directly to iWeb for use on your MobileMe Web site. Click 
Share➪Send to iWeb and then choose either Photo Page or Blog from the 
submenu. iPhoto automatically sends the selected images or album to iWeb 
and launches the application! You can also use iPhoto’s Web Gallery feature 
to get your photos on the Web. (More on the Web Gallery at the end of this 
chapter.)
Edit mode: Removing and fixing stuff the right way
Not every digital image is perfect — just look at my collection if you need 
proof. For those shots that need a pixel massage, iPhoto includes a number 
of editing tools that you can use to correct common problems.
The first step in any editing job is to select the image you want to fix in the 
Viewer. Then click the Edit button on the iPhoto toolbar to switch to the Edit 
mode controls, as shown in Figure 3-6. Now you’re ready to fix problems, 
using the tools that I discuss in the rest of this section. (If you’re editing a 
photo that’s part of an Event, album, Faces, or Places, note the spiffy scroll-
ing photo strip at the top, which allows you to switch to another image to 
edit from the same grouping.)
When you’re done with Edit mode, click the . . . (wait for it) . . . Done button!
Rotating tipped-over shots
If an image is in the wrong orientation and needs to be turned to display 
correctly, click the Rotate button to turn it once in a counterclockwise direc-
tion. Hold down the Option key while you click the Rotate button to rotate in 
a clockwise direction.
Crop ’til you drop
Does that photo have an intruder hovering around the edges of the subject? 
You can remove some of the border by cropping an image, just as folks once 
did with film prints and a pair of scissors. (We’ve come a long way.) With 
iPhoto, you can remove unwanted portions of an image; it’s a great way to 
get Uncle Milton’s stray head (complete with toupee) out of an otherwise 
perfect holiday snapshot.
Follow these steps to crop an image:
 
1. Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar.

2. Select the portion of the image that you want to keep.
 
 In the Viewer, click and drag the handles on the rectangle to outline the 
part of the image that you want. Remember, whatever’s outside this 
rectangle disappears after the crop is completed.
 
 When you drag a corner or edge of the outline, a semi-opaque grid 
(familiar to amateur and professional photographers as the nine squares 
from the Rule of Three) appears to help you visualize what you’re claim-
ing. (Check it out in Figure 3-7.)
 
3. (Optional) Choose a preset aspect ratio.
 
 If you want to force your cropped selection to a specific aspect ratio — 
such as 4 x 3 for an iDVD project — click the Constrain check box and 
select that ratio from the Constrain pop-up menu.
 
4. Click the Apply button.
 
 Oh, and don’t forget that you can use iPhoto’s Undo feature if you mess 
up and need to try again. Just press Ô+Z.
 
iPhoto features multiple Undo levels, so you can press Ô+Z several times to 
travel back through your last several changes.

Straightening what’s crooked
Was your camera slightly tilted when you took the perfect shot? Never fear! 
Click the Straighten button and then drag the slider to tilt the image in the 
desired direction. Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.
Enhancing images to add pizzazz
If a photo looks washed out, click the Enhance button to increase (or 
decrease) the color saturation and improve the contrast. Enhance is auto-
matic, so you don’t have to set anything. 
Removing rampant red-eye
Unfortunately, today’s digital cameras can still produce the same “zombies 
with red eyeballs” as traditional film cameras. Red-eye is caused by a cam-
era’s flash reflecting off the retinas of a subject’s eyes, and it can occur with 
both humans and animals. (I’m told pets get green-eye, but iPhoto can handle 
them, too!)
iPhoto can remove that red- and green-eye and turn frightening zombies 
back into your family and friends! Click the Red-Eye button and then select 
a demonized eyeball by clicking in the center of it. (If the new eyeball is too

small or too large, drag the Size slider to adjust the dimensions.) To com-
plete the process, click the X in the button that appears in the image.
Retouching like the stars
The iPhoto Retouch feature is perfect for removing minor flecks or lines 
in an image (especially those you’ve scanned from prints). Click Retouch 
and you’ll notice that the cursor turns into a crosshair; just drag the cursor 
across the imperfection. 
Switching to black-and-white or sepia
Ever wonder whether a particular photo in your library would look better as 
a black-and-white (or grayscale) print? Or perhaps an old-fashioned sepia tone 
in shades of copper and brown? Just click the Effects button to display the 
Effects window, which offers eight different effects you can apply to the photo.
Adjusting photo properties manually
Click Adjust to perform manual adjustments to brightness and contrast (the 
light levels in your image), as well as the sharpness, shadow, and highlight 
levels. To adjust a value, make sure that nothing’s selected in the image and 
then drag the corresponding slider until the image looks the way you want. 
Click the Close button to return to Edit mode.
 
While you’re editing, you can use the Next and Previous buttons at the 
lower-right corner of the iPhoto window to move to the next image in the 
current group (or back to the previous image).
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
Book mode unleashes what I think is probably the coolest feature of iPhoto: 
the chance to design and print a high-quality bound photo book! After you 
complete an album — all the images have been edited just the way you 
want, and the album contains all the photos you want to include in your 
book — iPhoto can send your images as data over the Internet to a company 
that prints and binds your finished book for you. (No, they don’t publish 
For Dummies titles, but then again, I don’t get high-resolution color plates in 
most of my books, either.)
At the time of this writing, you can order many different sizes and bindings, 
including an 8.5-by-11-inch soft-cover book with 20 double-sided pages for 
about $20 and a hardbound 8.5-by-11-inch keepsake album with 10 double-
sided pages for about $30 (shipping included for both). Extra pages can be 
added at $0.70 and $1.00 a pop, respectively.

350
Producing Your Own Coffee-Table Masterpiece
iPhoto ’09 can also produce and automatically order calendars and greeting 
cards, using a process similar to the one I describe in this section for pro-
ducing a book. Who needs that stationery store in the mall anymore?
 
If you’re going to create a photo book, make sure that the images have the 
highest quality and highest resolution. The higher the resolution, the better 
the photos look in the finished book. I personally always try to use images of 
over 1,000 pixels in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions.
To create a photo book, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired album in the source list to select it.
 
2. Click the Keepsakes toolbar button and click Book from the pop-up menu.
 
 Depending on your screen resolution, iPhoto may have room to display 
the Book button by itself — no big deal, because things work the same.
 
3. Select the size of the book and a theme.
 
 Your choices determine the number of pages and layout scheme, as well 
as the background graphics for each page.
 
4. Click Choose.
 
 You’ll see the controls shown in Figure 3-8.
 
 In Book mode, the Viewer changes in subtle ways. It displays the current 
page at the bottom of the display and adds a scrolling row of thumbnail 
images above it. This row of images represents the remaining images 
from the selected album that you can add to your book. You can drag 
any image thumbnail into one of the photo placeholders to add it to the 
page. You can also click the Page button at the left of the thumbnail 
strip — it looks like a page with a turned-down corner — to display 
thumbnails of each page in your book. (To return to the album image 
strip, click the Photos button under the Page button.)
 
5. Rearrange the page order to suit you by dragging the thumbnail of 
any page from one location to another in the strip.
 
6. In the Book toolbar below the page view, you can adjust a variety of 
settings for the final book, including the book’s theme, background, 
page numbers, and text fonts.
 
 At this point, you can also add captions and short descriptions to the 
pages of your photo album. Click any one of the text boxes in the page 
display and begin typing to add text to that page.

7. When you’re ready to publish your book, click the Buy Book button.
 
8. In a series of dialogs that appears, iPhoto guides you through the final 
steps to order a bound book.
 
 Note that you’re asked for credit card information, so have that plastic 
ready.
 
I wouldn’t attempt to order a book through a dial-up modem connection. 
The images are likely far too large to be sent successfully. If possible, use a 
broadband or network connection to the Internet while you’re ordering. If 
your only connection to the Internet is through a dial-up modem, I recom-
mend saving your book in PDF format and having it printed at a copy shop 
or printing service instead. (Choose File➪Print and then click the Save as 
PDF button.) Alternatively, pack your MacBook and head to the closest 
public library or wireless hotspot with Internet access to send the book files 
wirelessly!

You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
iPhoto ’09 includes a feature called MobileMe Gallery that does for images 
what podcasting does for audio: You can share your photos with friends, 
family, business clients, and anyone else with an Internet connection! (Your 
adoring public doesn’t even require a Mac; it can use That Other Kind of 
Computer.) iPhoto automatically uploads the selected images and leads you 
You can use iPhoto to create slideshows! Click 
the album or Event you want to display and 
click the Add button; then choose Slideshow 
from the toolbar and click Create. Notice that 
iPhoto adds a Slideshow item in the source list. 
The same scrolling thumbnail strip appears at 
the top of the Viewer — this time displaying 
the images in the album or Event. Click and 
drag the thumbnails so that they appear in the 
desired order.
To choose background music for your slide-
show, click the Music button in the Slideshow 
toolbar to display Apple’s theme music, as 
well as the tracks from your iTunes library. To 
choose a standard theme, click the Source 
pop-up menu and choose Theme Music; then 
select that perfect song and click Apply. To 
choose an iTunes song or playlist, click the 
Source pop-up menu and choose either the 
Music item (for your entire library) or a play-
list. You can also create a custom playlist by 
selecting the Custom Playlist for Slideshow 
check box. Then, drag the individual songs you 
want to the song list at the bottom of the sheet. 
(You can drag them to rearrange their order 
in the list as well.) Click Apply to accept your 
song list.
To configure your slideshow, click the Settings 
button in the Slideshow toolbar and click the 
All Slides tab. In the dialog that appears, you 
can specify the amount of time that each slide 
remains on the screen, as well as an optional 
title and rating displays. You can choose the 
transition that occurs between photos, too, 
or specify a random transition each time. 
MacBook owners appreciate the Aspect Ratio 
pop-up menu, which allows you to choose a 
16:9 widescreen display for your slideshow.
Click the This Slide tab to modify the settings for 
a specific slide (useful for keeping a slide on-
screen for a longer period of time or for setting 
a different transition than the default transition 
you choose from the Slideshow toolbar). I can 
recommend the Automatic Ken Burns effect — 
yep, the same one in iMovie — which lends 
an animated movement to the selected image. 
You can also set the selected photo to display 
in black and white, sepia, or antique coloring.
To display a preview of a single slide and its 
transitions, click the desired slide and then 
click Preview; this is a handy way of determin-
ing whether your delay and transition settings 
are really what you want for a particular slide. 
When you’re ready to play your slideshow, 
click the Play button, and iPhoto switches to 
full-screen mode. You can share your com-
pleted slideshow by clicking Share in the 
iPhoto menu, where you can send the slide-
show to iDVD (for later burning onto a DVD) or 
send it through e-mail.

You’ll Love MobileMe Gallery!
through the process of creating a new Web page to proudly display your 
photos. However, you must be a MobileMe subscriber to use the MobileMe 
Gallery feature. If you haven’t heard the news on Apple’s MobileMe service 
yet, see Chapter 4 of Book VI for the details.
To create a MobileMe Gallery, you designate one or more photos in the 
Viewer (or even select entire albums or Events in the Source list) and then 
click the Add button. Click the MobileMe toolbar button in the sheet that 
appears to display the Web Gallery settings.
Type a name for your new Web Gallery. You can elect to show the title of 
each photo, allow your visitors to download your images or upload their 
own, and even allow photos to be uploaded by other computer owners using 
an e-mail or a Web browser!
 
By default, any visitor to your MobileMe Web site can see your gallery. But 
what if you prefer a little security for those images? In that case, click the 
Album Viewable By pop-up menu, where you can limit your viewing audi-
ence (you can even require that your visitors enter a login name and pass-
word before they can receive your photos).
Click Publish, and you’ll see that iPhoto indicates that your images are being 
uploaded with a cool twirling progress icon to the right of the album in the 
source list. When the process is complete, iPhoto indicates that the photos 
appear in a MobileMe Gallery with a new heading in the Source list. You’re 
on the air!
Now for the other side of the coin: By selecting your MobileMe Gallery in the 
Source list and clicking Tell a Friend in the iPhoto toolbar, iPhoto automati-
cally prepares an e-mail message in Apple Mail that announces your new 
Gallery! Just add the recipient names and click Send. This spiffy message 
includes instructions for
 
✦ Folks using iPhoto ’09 on a Mac: As you can imagine, this is the easi-
est receive option to configure. After these folks are subscribed, they 
get an automatically updated album of the same name that appears in 
their source list, and they can use those images in their own iPhoto proj-
ects! From within iPhoto, your visitors can subscribe to your MobileMe 
Gallery by clicking File➪Subscribe to Photo Feed and entering the sub-
scription URL.
 
✦ Folks using Windows or an older version of iPhoto: These subscribers 
can use any Web browser with RSS support (such as the Safari browser 
that comes with Snow Leopard and is available from Apple for Windows 
XP or Vista) or any RSS reader. (In effect, your MobileMe Gallery 
becomes an RSS feed for those without iPhoto ’09.)

Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
 
By default, any changes you make to the contents of your MobileMe Gallery 
are updated automatically on your MobileMe account, and, in turn, are 
updated automatically to everyone who receives your images. You can 
turn this feature off, however, if you have a large number of images and you 
update often (which can result in your sister’s computer downloading a lot 
of data). To display the Check for New Photos setting for MobileMe Gallery, 
click iPhoto➪Preferences and click the Web button on the Preferences 
window toolbar. (You can also change the title for your Gallery and monitor 
your iDisk usage from this pane.)
Mailing Photos to Aunt Mildred
iPhoto can help you send your images through e-mail by automating the pro-
cess. The application can prepare your image and embed it automatically in 
a new message.
To send an image through e-mail, select it and then click the Email button 
in the toolbar. The dialog, as shown in Figure 3-9, appears, allowing you to 
choose the size of the images and whether you want to include their titles, 
descriptions, and Places location information as well.
 
Keep in mind that most ISP (Internet service provider) e-mail servers don’t 
accept an e-mail message that’s more than 3MB or 4MB, so watch that Size 
display. If you’re trying to send a number of images and the size goes over 
2MB, you might have to click the Size pop-up menu and choose a smaller 
size (reducing the image resolution) to get them all embedded in a single 
message.
Indeed it is! iPhoto ’09 introduces a direct con-
nection to both your Facebook social network-
ing account (at www.facebook.com) and 
your Flickr online gallery account (at www.
flickr.com), allowing you to simply select 
one or more photos and send them automatically 
to either service! These two buttons appear on 
the toolbar when you’re organizing your photos.
The first time you select photos in the Viewer 
(or an album or Event in the Source list) and 
click either button, iPhoto prompts you for per-
mission to set up your connection. (Of course, 
this will require you to enter your Facebook and 
Flickr account information — hence the confir-
mation request.) Click Set Up and provide the 
data that each site requires.
After you’ve set up your accounts, simply 
select your photos, albums, or Events and 
click the toolbar button for the desired service. 
Apple, you absolutely rock!

A
lfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, and Ridley Scott — 
those guys are amateurs! Welcome to the exciting world of moviemak-
ing on your MacBook, where you call the shots. With iMovie, you can try 
your hand at all aspects of the movie-creating process, including editing and 
special effects. Built with ease-of-use in mind, iMovie lets you perform full-
blown movie production on your Macintosh with a minimum of effort.
Don’t let iMovie’s fancy buttons and flashing lights fool you: This applica-
tion is a feature-packed tool for serious movie production. The iMovie 
controls work the same as many top-notch, movie-editing tools that profes-
sionals use. From basic editing to audio and video effects, iMovie has every-
thing that you need to get started creating high-quality movies.
The iMovie Window
If you’ve ever tried a professional-level video editing application, you prob-
ably felt as though you were suddenly dropped in the cockpit of a jumbo 
jet. In iMovie, though, all the controls you need are easy to use and logically 
placed.
 
Video editing takes up quite a bit of desktop space. In fact, you can’t run 
iMovie at resolutions of less than 1024 x 768, nor would you want to.
To launch iMovie, click the iMovie icon in the Dock. (It looks like a star from 
the Hollywood Walk of Fame.) You can also click the Application folder in 
any Finder window sidebar and then double-click the iMovie icon.

358
The iMovie Window
To follow the examples I show you here, follow these strenuous steps and 
create a new movie project:
 
1. Click the File menu and choose New Project (or press Ô+N).
 
 iMovie displays the sheet you see in Figure 4-1.
 
2. Type a name for your project.
 
3. Select the aspect ratio (or screen dimensions) for your movie.
 
 You can select a widescreen display (16:9), a standard display (4:3), or 
a display especially suited for an iPhone (3:2). If compatibility with the 
familiar SDTV format is important, I always recommend that you choose 
standard (4:3) ratio; choosing 16:9 for an SDTV set will result in those 
familiar black “letterbox” bars at the top and bottom of the screen. On 
the flip side, choosing 4:3 results in black bars on the left and right when 
shown on an HD set.
 
4. Click a thumbnail to select a theme to apply to your finished movie.
 
 If you choose a theme, iMovie automatically adds the transitions and 
titles that correspond to that theme. (Normally, this is what you want to 
do. However, if you want to add transitions and titles manually, click the 
Automatically Add Transitions and Titles check box to deselect it.)

 If you decide not to use a theme (by selecting the None thumbnail), iMovie 
can still add an automatic effect between clips. Click the Automatically Add

 You’re on your way! Check out Figure 4-2: This is the whole enchilada, in

The controls and displays that you’ll use most often follow:
 
✦ Monitor: Think of this as being just like your TV or computer monitor. 
Your video clips, still images, and finished movie play here. You’ll also 
crop and rotate your video within the monitor.
 
✦ Browser toolbar: This row of buttons allows you to switch between 
your media clips (video clips, photos, and audio) and the various tools 
that you use to make your film. The selected items fill the right side of 
the browser pane below the monitor.

✦ Event pane: All the video clips that you use to create your movie are 
stored in the Event pane. I show you what each of the panes in the 
iMovie workspace looks like when you tackle different tasks in this 
chapter.
 
✦ Project pane: iMovie displays the elements that you’ve added to your 
movie project in this pane.
 
✦ Playhead: The red vertical line that you see in the Event and Project 
panes is the playhead, which indicates the current editing point while 
you’re creating your movie. When you’re playing your movie, the play-
head moves to follow your progress through the movie.
 
✦ Editing toolbar: This strip of buttons allows you to control editing func-
tions such as cropping, audio and video adjustments, voiceovers, and 
selecting items.
 
✦ Camera Import window: Click this switch to import DV clips from your 
DV camcorder or iSight camera.
Those are the major highlights of the iMovie window. A director’s chair and 
megaphone are optional, of course, but they do add to the mood.
A Bird’s-Eye View of Moviemaking
I don’t want to box in your creative skills here — after all, you can attack 
the moviemaking process from a number of angles. (Pun unfortunately 
intended.) However, I’ve found that my movies turn out the best when I 
follow a linear process, so before I dive into specifics, allow me to provide 
you with an overview of moviemaking with iMovie.
Here’s my take on the process, reduced to seven steps:
 
1. Import your video clips either directly from your DV camcorder, 
iSight camera, or your hard drive.
 
2. Drag your new selection of clips from the Event pane to the Project 
pane and arrange them in the desired order.
 
3. Import or record audio clips (from iTunes, GarageBand, or external 
sources, such as audio CDs or audio files, that you’ve recorded your-
self) and add them to your movie.
 
4. Import your photos (directly from iPhoto or from your hard drive) and 
place them where needed in your movie.
 
5. Add professional niceties, such as voiceovers, transitions, effects, and 
text to the project.

Importing the Building Blocks
 
6. Preview your film and edit it further if necessary.
 
7. Share your finished film with others through the Web, e-mail, or a 
DVD that you create and burn with iDVD.
That’s the first step-by-step procedure in this chapter. I doubt that you’ll 
even need to refer back to it, however, because you’ll soon see just how easy 
it is to use iMovie.
 
As you might imagine, this chapter simply can’t hold a full description of 
every setting and every procedure within iMovie ’09 — but luckily, my good 
friend Dennis Cohen has done exactly that in his new book iMovie ’09 & 
iDVD ’09 For Dummies (Wiley Publishing). Dennis will take you from basics 
to all the in-depth features of these two iLife applications!
Importing the Building Blocks
Sure, you need video clips to create a movie of your own, but don’t panic if 
you have but a short supply. You can certainly turn to the other iLife appli-
cations for additional raw material. (See, I told you that integration thing 
would come in handy.)
Along with video clips you import from your DV camcorder, built-in iSight 
camera, and hard drive, you can also call on iPhoto for still images (think 
credits) and iTunes for background audio and effects. In this section, I show 
you how.
Pulling in video clips
Your MacBook is probably equipped already with the two extras that come 
in handy for video editing — namely, a large hard drive and a FireWire port. 
Because most mini-DV camcorders today use a FireWire connection to trans-
fer clips, you’re all set. (And even if your snazzy new DV camcorder uses a 
USB 2.0 connection, you’re still in the zone, although you will need to modify 
the steps I provide in this section for your particular device.) Oh, and since 
your MacBook has an iSight camera on board, you’re a self-contained movie 
studio!
Here’s the drill if your clips are on your FireWire-equipped mini-DV camcorder:
 
1. Plug the proper cable into your MacBook.
 
2. Set the DV camcorder to VTR (or VCR) mode.
 
 Some camcorders call this Play mode.

362
Importing the Building Blocks
 
3. Click the Camera Import button (labeled in Figure 4-2).
 
 iMovie opens a new window.
 
4. Click the Camera pop-up menu (at the bottom of the Import window) 
and select your DV camcorder or iSight camera.
 
 Playback controls appear under the Camera Import window, mirroring 
the controls on your DV camcorder. This allows you to control the unit 
from iMovie. Keen!
 
 To capture video from your iSight camera, click the Video Size pop-up 
menu to choose the dimensions of the clip; then click Capture. On the 
sheet that appears, choose the location where the video will be saved, 
and choose whether to add this video to an existing event or create a 
new event. Click Capture to start recording, and click Stop when your 
video is complete. (You can skip the rest of the steps in this section, 
which deal only with DV camcorders.)
 
5. Click the Import button.
 
6. Click the Save To pop-up menu and choose the drive that should store 
your clips.
 
 You can choose to add the new clips to an existing Event or create a new 
Event. Heck, if the event spanned more than one day, you can create a 
new Event for each day. (How do they think up these things?)
 
7. Click OK and admire your handiwork.
 
 iMovie begins transferring the footage to your MacBook and automati-
cally adds the imported clips to your Event Library.
 
If your clips are already on your hard drive, rest assured that iMovie can 
import them, including those in high-definition video (HDV) format. iMovie 
also recognizes a number of other video formats, as shown in Table 4-1.

To import a movie file, follow this bouncing ball:
 
1. Choose File➪Import and choose Movies from the submenu.
 
2. If you’re importing 1080i video clips, choose the quality setting.
 
 The Large setting will save you a significant amount of hard drive space, 
but the Full setting preserves the original resolution and detail. (If you’re 
not importing 1080i video, use the default Large setting and click OK. 
The Full setting demands all the CPU and RAM resources your MacBook 
can offer, so don’t expect to do much else while importing.)
 
3. Click the drive that should store your clips in the sidebar and then 
navigate to the desired location.
 
4. Specify whether you want to add the imported video to an existing 
Event or create a new Event.
 
 If you choose to add the video to an existing Event, click the pop-up 
menu and select an Event.
 
5. Specify whether you want to copy the video (leaving the original 
movie intact) or have the movie deleted after a successful import.
 
6. Click Import.
 
 Alternatively, you can also drag a video clip from a Finder window and 
drop it in the Project pane.
Making use of still images
Still images come in handy as impressive-looking titles or as ending credits 
to your movie. (Make sure you list a gaffer and a best boy to be truly profes-
sional.) However, you can use still images also to introduce scenes or to 
separate clips according to your whim. For example, I use stills when delin-
eating the days of a vacation within a movie or different Christmas celebra-
tions over time.
Here are two methods of adding stills to your movie:
 
✦ Adding images from iPhoto: Click the Photo Browser button in the 
Browser toolbar (or press Ô+2) and you’ll experience the thrill that is 
your iPhoto Library, right from iMovie (as shown in Figure 4-3). You can 
elect to display your entire iPhoto Library or more selective picks such 
as specific albums or Events. When you find the image you want to add, 
just drag it to the right spot in the Project pane.
 
✦ Importing images from your hard drive: If you’re a member of the 
International Drag-and-Drop Society, you can drag TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PICT, 
PNG, and PSD images directly from a Finder window and drop them into 
the Project pane as well.

Importing and adding audio from all sorts of places
You can pull in everything from Wagner to Weezer as both background 
music and sound effects for your movie. In this section, I focus on how to get 
those notes into iMovie and then how to add them to your movie by drag-
ging them to the Project pane.
You can add audio from a number of sources:
 
✦ Adding songs from iTunes: Click the Show Music and Sound Effects 
button in the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+1) to display the contents of 
your iTunes Library. Click the desired playlist in the scrolling list box, 
such as the Dinah Washington playlist I selected in Figure 4-4. (If you’ve 
exported any original music you’ve composed in GarageBand to your 
iTunes Library, you can use those songs in your own movie!) You can 
add a track to your movie by dragging the song entry from the Music 
and Sound Effects list to the desired spot in the Project pane.
 
✦ Adding sound effects: Yep, if you need the sound of a horse gallop-
ing for your Rocky Mountain vacation clips, click either iMovie Sound 
Effects or iLife Sound Effects in the scrolling list box. iMovie includes a

Importing the Building Blocks
number of top-shelf audio effects that you can use in the second audio 
track on the timeline viewer. This way, you can add sound effects even 
when you’ve already added a background song. Again, to add a sound 
effect, drag it to the perfect spot in the Project pane.
 
 If you have several gigabytes of music in your iTunes Library, it might 
be more of a challenge to locate “Me and Bobby McGee” by Janis Joplin, 
especially if she’s included in a compilation. Let your MacBook do the 
digging for you! Click in the Search box below the track list and begin 
typing a song name. iMovie narrows down the song titles displayed to 
those that match the characters you type. To reset the search box and 
display all your songs in the Library or selected playlist, click the X icon 
that appears to the right of the box.
 
✦ Ripping songs from an audio CD: Load an audio CD and then choose 
Audio CD from the scrolling list box. iMovie displays the tracks from the 
CD, and you can add them at the current playhead position the same 
way as iTunes songs.
 
✦ Recording directly from a microphone: Yep, if you’re thinking 
voiceover narration, you’ve hit the nail on the head. Check out the side-
bar, “Narration the easy way,” for the scoop.

You can fine-tune both the audio within a video clip or the audio clips that 
you add to your project. With the desired clip selected, click the Inspector 
button in the Editing toolbar (it bears a proud letter i) and click the Audio 
tab. The Audio Adjustments window that appears includes an array of audio 
controls that allow you to change the volume of the selected clip, or to give 
that audio priority over other audio playing simultaneously (such as a sound 
effect that needs to be clearly heard over background music and the video 
clip). If your clips dramatically vary in volume, click the Normalize Clip 
Volume button and then select each clip that you want to set to the same 
Ready to create that award-winning nature 
documentary? You can add voiceover narra-
tion to your iMovie project that would make 
Jacques Cousteau proud. In fact, you can 
record your voice while you watch your movie 
playing, allowing perfect synchronization with 
the action! To add narration, follow these steps:
 1. Click the Voiceover button in the Editing 
toolbar — it sports a microphone icon — 
to open the Voiceover window.
 2. Click the Record From pop-up menu and 
select the input device.
 
 MacBooks sport a decent internal micro-
phone, but you can always add a USB 
microphone to your system.
 3. Drag the input volume slider to a comfort-
able level.
 
 You can monitor the volume level of your 
voice with the left and right input meters — 
try to keep the meters at 50 percent or so 
for the proper volume level.
 4. To block out ambient noise levels , drag 
the Noise Reduction slider to the right if 
necessary.
 
 If you’d like iMovie to enhance your voice 
electronically for a more professional 
sound, click the Voice Enhancement check 
box to select it. If you need to hear the 
audio from your movie project while you 
speak, click the Play Project Audio While 
Recording check box to select it — note, 
however, that you’ll need to listen to the 
audio while using a set of headphones 
(plugged into your Mac’s headphone jack) 
to avoid feedback problems.
 5. Click in the desired spot within a clip 
in the Project pane where the narration 
should begin.
 6. Begin speaking when prompted by iMovie.
 7. Watch the video while you narrate so that 
you can coordinate your narration track 
with the action.
 8. Click anywhere in the iMovie window to 
stop recording (or wait until the clip ends).
 
 iMovie adds an icon to the Project pane 
underneath the video with the voiceover.

window.

volume; click Normalize Clip Volume again for each clip. You can also set 
an automatic or manual Fade-in/Fade-out for the audio. When you’re done 
tweaking, click Done. (Oh, and don’t forget that you can always return the 
clip to its original volume; just open this window again and click Revert to 
Original.)
Building the Cinematic Basics
Time to dive in and add the building blocks to create your movie. Along with 
video clips, audio tracks, and still images, you can add Hollywood-quality 
transitions, optical effects, and animated text titles. In this section, I demon-
strate how to elevate your collection of video clips into a real-life furshlug-
giner movie.
Adding clips to your movie
You can add clips to your movie by using the Project pane and the Event 
pane. The Dynamic Duo works like this:
 
✦ Project pane: This displays the media you’ve added to your project so 
far, allowing you to rearrange the clips, titles, transitions and still images 
in your movie.
 
✦ Event pane: This displays your video clips arranged by Event (the date 
they were shot or the date they were imported), acting as the source 
repository for all your clips. Movies pulled into iMovie, imported into 
iPhoto, or added manually from the Finder appear here.
To add a clip to your movie, follow these steps:
 
1. Move your cursor across clips in the Event pane to watch a preview of 
the video.
 
2. When you’ve decided what to add to your project, you can either add 
the entire clip or a selection.
 
• To select an entire clip, right-click the clip’s thumbnail and choose 
Select Entire Clip from the menu that appears.
 
• To select a portion of a clip, drag your cursor across the thumbnail. 
A yellow frame appears around your selection. To change the length 
of the selected video, drag the handles that appear on either side. If 
you make a mistake while selecting video, just click any empty space 
within the Event pane to remove the selection frame and try again.

368
Building the Cinematic Basics
 
3. Drag the selection from the Event pane to the spot where it belongs in 
the Project pane.
 
 Alternatively, you can press the E key or click the Add to Project button 
(the first button in the Editing toolbar).
Do this several times, and you have a movie, which you’ve created just as 
the editors of old used to by working with actual film clips. This is a good 
point to mention a moviemaking Mark’s Maxim:
 
Preview your work — and do it often.
iMovie offers two Play Full screen buttons: one under the Event Library 
and one under the Project Library. Select the project or Event you want to 
play and then click the corresponding button (or press Ô+G). You can also 
choose View➪Play Full Screen to watch the selection. Press the spacebar to 
pause, and press Esc to return to iMovie. You can also move your cursor 
to display a filmstrip that you can click to skip forward or backward in the 
project or Event.
To play a selection from the beginning, press \ (the slash that leans to the 
left). (If you’ve ever watched directors at work on today’s movie sets, you 
may have noticed that they’re constantly watching a monitor to see what 
things will look like for the audience. You have the same option in iMovie!)
 
While you’re watching video in the Event pane, you may decide that a 
certain clip has a favorite scene or that another clip has material you don’t 
want, such as Uncle Ed’s shadow puppets. (Shudder.) iMovie ’09 features 
Favorite and Rejected frames, allowing you to view and use your best camera 
work (and ignore the worst stuff). To mark video, select a range of frames or 
an entire clip and then click the Mark as Favorite button in the Editing tool-
bar. Click the Reject button to hide the selected video or frames from view. 
(You can always unmark a Favorite or Rejected scene using the Unmark 
button in the Editing toolbar.)
Removing clips from your movie
Don’t like a clip? Bah. To banish a clip from your movie, follow these steps
 
1. Click the offending clip in the Project pane to select it.
 
2. Press Delete.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click the clip (or a selection you’ve made by 
dragging) and choose either Delete Entire Clip or Delete Selection from 
the menu that appears.

Building the Cinematic Basics
If you remove the wrong clip, don’t panic. Instead, use iMovie’s Undo feature 
(press Ô+Z) to restore it.
Reordering clips in your movie
 
If Day One of your vacation appears after Day Two, you can easily reorder 
your clips and stills by dragging them to the proper space in the Project 
pane. When you take your finger off the trackpad, iMovie automatically 
moves the rest of your movie aside with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Editing clips in iMovie
If a clip has extra seconds of footage at the beginning or end, you don’t want 
that superfluous stuff in your masterpiece. Our favorite video editor gives 
you the following functions:
 
✦ Crop: Removes unwanted material from a video clip or still image, allow-
ing you to change the aspect ratio of the media
 
✦ Rotate: Rotates a clip or image on its center axis
 
✦ Trim: Trims frames from a video clip
Before you can edit, however, you have to select a section of a clip:
 
1. Click a clip or image in either the Project pane (where changes you 
make are specific to this project) or the Event pane (where edits you 
make are reflected in any project using that footage).
 
 iMovie displays the clip or image in the monitor.
 
2. To select the entire clip or image, simply click it.
 
3. Drag your cursor across the thumbnail to select the section of the 
media you want to edit. (Note that some editing functions, such as 
Crop and Rotate, will automatically apply to the entire clip.)
 
 The selected region is surrounded by a yellow frame. You’re ready to 
edit that selected part of the clip.
 
Note the handles that appear at the beginning or ending of the selection. 
You can make fine changes to the selected section by dragging them.
 
✦ To crop: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar to display the frame 
in the Monitor pane and then click Crop at the top of the Monitor pane. 
Drag the edges of the frame and the handles to select the section you 
want to keep. To preview your selection, click the Play button at the top 
of the monitor. When you’re ready, click Done, and everything but the 
selected region is removed.

370
Building the Cinematic Basics
 
✦ To rotate: Click the Crop button in the Edit toolbar and then click one of 
the two rotation buttons (which carry a curved arrow icon). Each click 
rotates the media 90 degrees in that direction. Click Done when the clip 
or image is properly oriented.
 
✦ To trim: Choose Edit➪Trim to Selection. iMovie removes the frames 
from around the selected video.
 
Edits that you make to one clip or still image can actually be copied to mul-
tiple items! Select the edited clip and click Edit➪Copy from the iMovie menu. 
Now you can select one or more clips and choose Edit➪Paste Adjustments 
to apply Video, Audio, or Crop edits. (To apply all three types of edits, just 
choose All.)
Transitions for the masses
Many iMovie owners approach transitions as visual bookends: They merely 
act as placeholders that appear between video clips. Nothing could be farther 
from the truth, because judicious use of transitions can make or break a 
scene. For example, which would you prefer after a wedding ceremony — an 
abrupt, jarring cut to the reception or a gradual fadeout to the reception?
 
Today’s audiences are sensitive to transitions between scenes. Try not to 
overuse the same transition. Also weigh the visual impact of a transition 
carefully.
iMovie includes a surprising array of transitions, including old favorites (such 
as Fade In and Dissolve) and some nifty stuff you might not be familiar with 
(such as Cube and Page Curl). To display your transition collection (Figure 
4-5), click the Show Transitions button on the Browser toolbar (or press Ô+4).
To see what a particular transition looks like, move your cursor over the 
thumbnail to display the transition in miniature.
Adding a transition couldn’t be easier: Drag the transition from the list in the 
Transitions Browser pane and drop it between clips or between a clip and a still 
image in the Project pane. In iMovie ’09, transitions are applied in real time.
Even Gone with the Wind had titles
The last stop on our iMovie Hollywood Features Tour is the Titles Browser, 
shown in Figure 4-6. You’ll find it by clicking the Title button on the Browser 
toolbar (which bears a big capital T), or by pressing Ô+3. You can add a title 
with a still image, but iMovie also includes everything you need to add basic 
animated text to your movie.

Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
Most of the controls you can adjust are the same for each animation style. 
You can change the font, the size of the text, and the color of the text.
To add a title manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an animation thumbnail from the Title Browser pane and drag 
it to the desired spot in the Project pane.
 
2. Click a background thumbnail to select a background for your title.
 
3. Click the Show Fonts button in the monitor window to make any 
changes to the fonts or text attributes.
 
4. Click in a text box to type your own line of text.
 
5. Click the Play button to preview your title.
 
 iMovie displays a preview of the effect in the monitor with the settings 
that you choose.
 
6. Click Done.
 
 The title appears in the Project pane.
Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
Your movie is complete, you’ve saved it to your hard drive, and now you’re 
wondering where to go from here. Click Share on the application menu bar, 
and you’ll see that iMovie can unleash your movie upon your unsuspecting 
family and friends (and even the entire world) in a number of ways:
 
✦ iTunes: Send your movie to your iTunes Library as a movie.
 
✦ Media Browser: Make your iMovie project available within other iLife 
’09 applications, in five different sizes suited to different display devices.
 
✦ YouTube: Yep, you read right, you can send your iMovie directly to the 
YouTube Web site! Can it get more convenient than that? (I think not.)
 
✦ MobileMe Gallery: Share your movie with the world at large by post-
ing it within a Gallery on your MobileMe Web site. (I provide more 
MobileMe details to chew on in Book VI, Chapter 4.)
 
✦ Export Movie: Create a copy of your movie on your hard drive in one of 
five different sizes.
 
✦ Export using QuickTime: Create a QuickTime movie with your project 
using the QuickTime encoding engine (allowing greater control over the 
export process and the attributes of the finished movie file).

Book IV
Chapter 4
Making Magic 
with iMovie
373
Sharing Your Finished Classic with Others
 
 If you use this option, any computer with an installed copy of QuickTime 
can display your movies, and you can use QuickTime movies in Keynote 
presentations as well.
 
✦ Export to Final Cut XML: If you’d like to transfer your iMovie ’09 project 
to Final Cut Pro, use this option to create a compatible XML file.
When you choose a sharing option, iMovie displays the video quality for the 
option and makes automatic changes to the movie attributes. (For example, 
choosing Tiny reduces the finished movie as far as possible in file size, and 
the audio is reduced to mono instead of stereo.)
 
Need to take a movie offline or stop sharing it? You can remove a project 
from iTunes, your iLife Media Browser, your MobileMe Web site, or the 
YouTube Web site from the Sharing menu as well. Just click the corre-
sponding Remove menu item. (Of course, you can share the project again 
at any time.)
 
If you’re worried about permanently reducing the quality of your project 
by sharing it in a smaller size, fear not! When you choose a sharing option 
to export your movie, your original project remains on your hard drive, 
unchanged, so you can share a better-quality version at any time in the 
future!
After you adjust any settings specific to the desired sharing option, click 
Publish (or Save) to start the ball rolling.

A
 number of years ago, I bore witness to yet another proud moment in 
Apple history: the arrival of a powerful DVD recorder in an affordable 
computer. The SuperDrive was revolutionary because suddenly folks could 
create and view their own professional-quality DVDs.
Today the tradition continues: Apple includes iDVD free with today’s 
MacBooks as part of iLife ’09. With iDVD, you can easily create beautiful pre-
sentations with animation and interactive menus that anyone can watch in 
a standard DVD player or computer DVD drive. And that, friends and neigh-
bors, is the quintessential definition of cool.
In this chapter, I show you the basics of creating your first home-cooked 
DVD movie — and you’ll even have fun doing it!
Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
Figure 5-1 shows iDVD in all its glory. You have to supply your own digital 
video clips, background audio, and digital photographs, of course.

Take a moment to appreciate iDVD — no secondary windows to fiddle with 
or silly palettes strung out everywhere. (Can you tell that I’ve had my fill of 
old-style DVD authoring applications?) Allow me to list the highlights of the 
iDVD window:
 
✦ Menu display: This section takes up the largest part of the iDVD 
window, with good reason. You create your project here. In this 
case, Menu refers to your DVD Menu, not the menu at the top of your 
MacBook’s display.
 
✦ Media pane: You add video, still images, and audio to your project from 
here, as well as tweak and fine-tune things. The Media pane actually 
comprises three separate panes. To choose a new pane, click one of 
these buttons at the bottom of the screen:

Introducing Your Mac to iDVD
 
• Themes: You apply themes (such as Travel Cards, Wedding White, 
and Baby Mobile) to your DVD Menu to give it a certain look and feel.
 
• Buttons: These options apply to the item currently selected, such as 
drop shadows on your text titles or the appearance of your Menu 
buttons.
 
• Media: From here, you can add media items, such as video clips and 
photos, to your Menu.
 
✦ Add button: From this pop-up menu (which sports a dapper plus sign), 
you can choose one of three types of buttons to add to a project. The 
choices are
 
• Add Submenu: Choose this item to add a new submenu button to 
your DVD Menu. The person using your DVD Menu can click a button 
to display a new submenu that can include additional movies or 
slideshows. (If that sounds like ancient Greek, hang on. All becomes 
clearer later in the chapter, in the section “Adding movies.”)
 
 A Menu can hold only a maximum of 12 buttons (depending on the 
theme you choose), so submenus let you pack more content on your 
DVD. (Older versions of the application allowed only six buttons, so 
don’t feel too cheated.) Anyway, each submenu you create can hold 
another 12 buttons.
 
• Add Movie: Yep, this is the most popular button in the whole 
shooting match. Click this menu item to add a new movie clip to 
your Menu.
 
• Add Slideshow: If you want to add a slideshow to your DVD — say, 
using photos from your hard drive or pictures from your iPhoto 
library — click this menu item.
 
✦ Inspector button: Click this button to display the Inspector window for 
the current Menu or a highlighted object. From this window, you can 
change the look of an individual submenu button or an entire Menu.
 
✦ DVD Map: Click the Map button to display the organizational chart for 
your DVD Menu. Each button and submenu that you add to your top-
level DVD Menu is displayed here, and you can jump directly to a par-
ticular item by double-clicking it. Use this road map to help design the 
layout of your DVD Menu system or to get to a particular item quickly. 
To return to the Menu display, click the Map button again.
 
✦ Motion: Click this button to start or stop the animation cycle used with 
the current iDVD theme. The animation repeats (just as it will on your 
finished DVD) until you click the Motion button again.

378
Starting a New DVD Project
 
 Need a visual indicator of the length of your Menu’s animation cycle? 
Click View➪Show Motion Playhead to display the animation playhead, 
which moves below the Menu display to indicate where you are in the 
animation cycle. As you can with other playheads in the iLife suite, you 
can click and drag the diamond-shaped playhead button to move any-
where in the animation cycle.
 
✦ Edit Drop Zones: This button allows you to edit the look and contents 
of a drop zone on your Menu. (Don’t worry, I explain more about drop 
zones in the sidebar titled, “Taking advantage of drop zones,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
✦ Preview: To see how your DVD Menu project looks when burned to a 
DVD, click Preview. You get a truly nifty on-screen remote control that 
you can use to navigate your DVD Menu, just as if you were watching 
your DVD on a standard DVD player. To exit Preview mode, click the 
Stop button on the remote control. 
 
✦ Burn: Oh, yeah, you know what this one is for — recording your com-
pleted DVD movie to a blank disc.
That’s the lot! Time to get down to the step-by-step business of making movies.

Starting a New DVD Project
Creating a new project
If you choose Create a New Project, iDVD prompts you to type a name for 
your new DVD project and to set a location where the project files should 
be saved. By default, the very reasonable choice is your Documents folder. 
You also get to choose whether your project will display in a Standard (full-
screen) aspect ratio of 4:3 or a Widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9. If you’ve 
been watching DVD movies for some time, you recognize these two terms.
 
You’ll probably crave Widescreen format if you have a widescreen TV — go 
figure — but both formats will display on both types of televisions, complete 
with those black bars we all know and love at the top and bottom (or left 
and right sides) of the screen.
Click Create, and the iDVD window appears in all its glory.
Opening an existing project
If you’ve used iDVD and had a DVD project open the last time you quit the 
application, iDVD automatically loads the DVD project you were working on. 
However, you can open any DVD you’ve created by clicking Open an Existing 
Project. (To choose a different existing project from the iDVD window, press 
Ô+O or choose File➪Open Recent.)
Automating the whole darn process
If you’re a fan of click-it-and-forget-it (or are in a hurry), you can throw cau-
tion to the wind and allow iDVD to create your latest epic for you! iDVD 
offers two automated methods of creating a DVD movie disc. 
Using OneStep DVD
With OneStep, iDVD does almost all of the work automatically, by using the 
media clips and photos that you specify. To allow iDVD to help you create 
a movie, click the OneStep DVD button on the top-level menu (refer back to 
Figure 5-2). If you’ve already opened a project, choose File➪OneStep DVD 
from the application’s menu bar (to import clips directly from your FireWire 
mini-DV camera) or OneStep DVD from Movie (to select a clip to import from 
your hard drive). OneStep DVD does not work with camcorders that use a 
USB connection to your MacBook. I tell you more about the OneStep DVD 
feature later, in the section “A Word about Automation.”
Using Magic iDVD
Magic iDVD is the newcomer on the block, and it falls neatly between total 
automation (with OneStep DVD) and total manual control. Click the Magic 
iDVD button on the top-level menu (as shown in Figure 5-2). If you’ve already 

380
Creating a DVD from Scratch
opened a project, you can choose File➪Magic iDVD from the menu bar to 
choose a theme, drop specific movies and specific photos into filmstrips, 
and choose an audio track.
In contrast to OneStep DVD, you get to preview the finished product. If it’s to 
your liking, you can choose to either burn the disc directly or create a full-
blown iDVD project with the results. Sweet.
You find out more about the new Magic iDVD feature later, in the section “A 
Word about Automation.”
Creating a DVD from Scratch
Doing things the old-fashioned, creative, and manual way (following the 
examples in this section) involves four basic steps:
 
1. Design the DVD Menu.
 
 Choose a theme and any necessary buttons or links.
 
2. Add media.
 
 You can drag movie files from iMovie, still images from iPhoto, and 
music from iTunes.
 
3. Tweak.
 
 Adjust and fine-tune your DVD Menu settings.
 
4. Finish things up.
 
 Preview and burn your DVD or save it to your hard drive.
Choosing just the right theme
The first step to take when manually designing a new DVD Menu system is 
to add a theme. In the iDVD world, a theme is a preset package that helps 
determine the appearance and visual appeal of your DVD Menu, including a

for text fonts and button styles.
iDVD helps those of us who are graphically challenged by including a wide 
range of professionally designed themes for all sorts of occasions, rang-
ing from old standbys such as weddings, birthdays, and vacations to more 
generic themes with the accent on action, friendship, and technology. To 
view the included themes, click the Themes button in the lower-right corner 
of the iDVD window (see Figure 5-3).

pane.
 
To choose a theme for your project — or to see what a theme looks like on 
your Menu — click any thumbnail and watch iDVD update the Menu display.
 
If you decide while creating your DVD Menu that you need a different theme, 
you can change themes at any time. iDVD won’t lose a single button or video 
clip that you add to your DVD Menu. You’ll be amazed at how the look and 
sound of your DVD Menu completely change with just the click of a theme 
thumbnail.
Adding movies
Drop zones and themes are cool, but most folks want to add video to their 
DVD. To accomplish this, iDVD uses buttons as links to your video clips. In 
fact, some iDVD Movie buttons display a preview of the video they’ll display! 
To play the video on a DVD player, you select the Movie button with the 
remote control, just as you do for a commercial DVD.
To add a Movie button, drag a QuickTime movie file from the Finder and 
drop it onto your DVD Menu display. (Only MPEG-4 QuickTime movies 
and DV streams are supported — MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 movie clips may be 

382
Creating a DVD from Scratch
rejected or converted, or even be added without audio.) Alternatively, click 
the Add button and choose Add Movie from the pop-up menu.
 
iDVD and iMovie are soul mates, so you can also display the iDVD Media 
pane and then click Movies from the pop-up menu. Now you can drag clips 
from your Movies folder.
No matter the source of the clip, when you drop it onto your DVD Menu, 
iDVD adds a Movie button, as you can see in Figure 5-4. Note that some but-
tons appear as text links rather than actual buttons. The appearance of a 
Movie button in your DVD Menu is determined by the theme you choose.
Most of Apple’s animated themes include spe-
cial bordered areas marked as drop zones. 
These locations have nothing to do with skydiv-
ing; rather, a drop zone is a placeholder in the 
Menu that can hold a single video clip or photo-
graph. When you drag a video clip or an image 
to a drop zone, that clip or picture is added to 
the animation in Apple’s theme! Think about 
that for a moment; I know I did. You can actu-
ally personalize a Hollywood-quality animated 
DVD Menu with your own photos and video!
Most of the themes included with iDVD include 
at least one drop zone, and some are practi-
cally jam-packed with drop zones. For example, 
the amazing Forever theme has a whopping six 
drop zones! If you think a Menu looks just fine 
without anything in a drop zone, however, you 
don’t have to put anything there. The words 
Drop Zone disappear when you preview or 
burn your DVD. (Empty frames do tend to look a 
bit silly in some themes, though.)
To add a video clip or image to a drop zone, 
simply drag the clip or photo from a Finder 
window and drop it on the desired drop zone. 
You can also drag clips or photos from other 
sources, including the Movies and Photos 
panes in iDVD’s Media pane, the iMovie 
window, or the iPhoto window. (Remember, 
Apple is anything but strict on these matters.) 
Remember, drop zones don’t act as links or 
buttons to other content; the stuff you add to a 
Menu’s drop zones appears only as part of the 
theme’s animation cycle. You can even drag 
an iPhoto event or album to a drop zone, and 
it will continuously cycle through the images. 
Wowzers!
To see all the drop zones at one time (without 
cycling through the animation), click the Edit 
Drop Zones button at the bottom center of the 
iDVD window; when you do, you see a thumb-
nail display of each zone. You can drag items 
to these thumbnails or jump right to one in the 
animation by clicking the thumbnail. To delete 
the contents of a drop zone, click the thumbnail 
in the editor and press the Delete key.
If you’re adding something to a dynamic drop 
zone (which disappears and reappears during 
the menu animation cycle), click the Motion 
button to activate the animation and then click 
it again to stop the animation cycle. Now click 
and drag the scrubber bar until the desired 
drop zone is in view. To delete the contents of 
a drop zone, Control-click (or right-click) the 
drop zone and choose Clear.

Figure 5-4: 
A new 
Movie 
button 
appears on 
your pristine 
DVD Menu.
 
 
A Movie button doesn’t have to stay where iDVD places it! By default, iDVD 
aligns buttons and text objects using an invisible grid, but if you don’t want 
such order imposed on your creativity, just drag the object to where you’d 
like it to be to turn on Free Positioning. (You can also right-click the object 
and select the Free Positioning item from the menu that appears.) iDVD even 
provides cool new automatic guides that help you align objects when you’re 
using Free Positioning! You’ll see them as yellow lines that appear when 
objects are aligned along a vertical or horizontal plane.
You can have up to 12 buttons on your iDVD Menu (the theme you choose 
determines the maximum number of buttons you can add). To add more 
content than 12 buttons allow, add a submenu by clicking the Add button 
and choosing Add Submenu from the pop-up menu. Now you can click the 
submenu button to jump to that screen and drag up to another 12 movie 
files into it.
 
Keep your target audience in mind while you create your DVD. Standard TV 
sets have a different aspect ratio (height to width) and resolution (number 
of scan lines on the screen) than a digital video clip, and a standard TV isn’t 
as precise in focusing that image on the tube. If you selected the Standard 

384
Creating a DVD from Scratch
aspect ratio when you created the project, you can make sure that your DVD 
content looks great on a standard TV screen by following these steps:
 
1. Click View on the old-fashioned iDVD menu (the one at the top of the 
screen).
 
2. Choose the Show TV Safe Area command.
 
 You can also press the convenient Ô+T shortcut. iDVD adds a smaller 
rectangle within the iDVD window to mark the screen dimensions of a 
standard TV.
If you take care that your Menu buttons and (most of) your background 
image fit within this smaller rectangle, you’re assured that folks with a stan-
dard television can enjoy your work. To turn off the TV Safe Area rectangle, 
press Ô+T again.
If your entire family is blessed with a fleet of HD TVs (or you chose the 
Widescreen aspect ratio for this project), leave the Show TV Safe Area 
option off. Today’s widescreen displays can handle just about any 
orientation.
For best playback results on a standard TV, 
make sure that your background image has 
the same dimensions as standard digital 
video — 640 x 480 pixels. If the dimensions of 
your image don’t match the dimensions of digi-
tal video, iDVD will stretch or shrink the image 
to fit, which might have undesirable effects. 
When your image is stretched and skewed to 
fit the DVD Menu, Aunt Harriet might end up 
looking like Shrek.
You can use QuickTime player or iPhoto to 
change the dimensions of your background 
image for import into iDVD. For example, you 
can use the iPhoto crop feature to alter the 
overall shape of the image and then resize it 
within iPhoto. Use the Size setting when you 
export the image from iPhoto and then save 
the file in the Pictures folder located in your 
Home folder so that you can find it easily later. 
(For more on working in iPhoto, see Book IV, 
Chapter 3.)
If you enjoy a cutting-edge widescreen (16:9) 
or HD (high-definition) TV display, you won’t 
have the standard TV dimension restriction 
of 640 x 480 pixels. And because iDVD sup-
ports HD video and 16:9 video with a number 
of widescreen themes, be prepared to kiss the 
phrases pan-and-scan and full-screen good-
bye and forget about the Show TV Safe Area 
feature. If your completed DVD projects are 
purely for your own enjoyment, that’s a great 
idea. However, don’t forget that if you distrib-
ute your discs to others with old-fashioned TVs 
dating back to the archaic ’80s and ’90s, they 
might not be pleased with what they see!

Creating a DVD from Scratch
Great, now my audience demands a slideshow
Many MacBook owners don’t realize that iDVD can use not only video clips 
but also digital photos as content. In fact, you can add a group of images to 
your DVD Menu by using Slideshow buttons, which allow the viewer to play 
back a series of digital photographs. iDVD handles everything for you, so 
there’s no tricky timing to figure out or weird scripts to write. Just click the 
Add button at the bottom of the iDVD window and choose Add Slideshow. 
iDVD places a Slideshow button on your DVD Menu.
After the Slideshow button is on tap, add the content — in this case, by 
choosing the images that iDVD adds to your DVD Menu. Follow these steps 
to select your slideshow images:
 
1. Double-click the Slideshow Menu button — the one you just added to 
the Menu — to open the Slideshow display (see Figure 5-5).
 
2. Click the Media button (bottom right of the screen).
 
3. Click the Photos tab (top right of the screen) to display your iPhoto 
library and photo albums.

4. Drag your favorite image thumbnails from the Photos list and drop 
them into the My Slideshow window.
 
 You can also drag images straight from a Finder window or the iPhoto 
window itself. (Those Apple folks are sooooo predictable.)
 
5. Drag around the photos in the My Slideshow window to set their order 
of appearance in your slideshow.
 
6. To add audio to these pictures, drag your favorite audio file from the 
Finder and drop it in the Audio well in the My Slideshow window.
 
 The Audio well is the box bearing the speaker icon, next to the volume 
control below the My Slideshow window.
 
 Alternatively, click the Audio tab to select an audio track from your 
iTunes library, iTunes playlists, or GarageBand creations.
 
7. Click the Return button to return to your DVD Menu.
 
If you’re using a Menu with animated buttons that display an image (rather 
than text buttons), you can choose which image you want to appear on the 
Slideshow button. Click the Slideshow button that you added and see the 
slider that appears above the Slideshow button. Drag this slider to scroll 
through the images you added. When you find the image that you want to 
use for the Slideshow button in the DVD Menu, click the Slideshow button 
again to save your changes.
Now for the music . . .
Most of the Apple-supplied themes already have their own background 
music, so you might not even need to add music to your DVD Menu. 
However, if you want to change the existing background music (or if your 
DVD Menu currently doesn’t have any music), adding your own audio to the 
current Menu is child’s play!
 
1. Click the Media button.
 
2. Click the Audio tab to reveal the musical Shangri-La, as shown in 
Figure 5-6.
 
3. Drag an audio file from the iTunes playlist or GarageBand folder dis-
play and drop it on the Menu background.
 
 iDVD accepts every sound format that you can use for importing and 
encoding in iTunes: AIFF, MP3, AAC, Apple Lossless, and WAV audio 
files.
 
4. Click the Motion button (labeled in Figure 5-1) to watch your DVD 
Menu animation cycle set to the new background audio.
 
5. Click the Motion button again to stop the animation and return to seri-
ous work.

You can easily make changes to the default settings provided with the 
theme you chose. iDVD offers all sorts of controls that allow you to change 
the appearance and behavior of buttons, text, and the presentation of your 
content. In this section, I show you how to cast out iDVD’s (perfectly good) 
defaults and then tweak things to perfection.
Using Uncle Morty for your DVD Menu background
Hey, Uncle Morty might not be a supermodel, but he has birthdays and anni-
versaries, and iDVD is more than happy to accommodate you in document-
ing those milestones! Follow these steps to change the background of your 
DVD Menu:
 
1. Click the Inspector button.
 
2. Get an image using one of the following methods:
 
• Drag an image from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
• Drag the image directly into the Menu display.

388

• To use an image from your iPhoto library, click the Media button and 
click the Photos tab, and then drag the desired image into the Menu 
display.
 
 iDVD updates the DVD Menu to reflect your new background choice.
Adding your own titles
The one tweak you’ll probably have to perform in every iDVD project is 
changing titles. Unfortunately, the default labels provided by iDVD are pretty 
lame, and they appear in two important places:
 
✦ Menu title: Your large main title usually appears at the top of the 
DVD Menu.
 
✦ Button captions: Each Submenu, Movie, and Slideshow button that you 
add to your Menu has its own title.
To change the text in your Menu title or the titles below your buttons, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the text by clicking it.
 
2. Click it again to edit it.
 
 A rectangle with a cursor appears to indicate that you can now edit 
the text.
 
3. Type the new text and press Return to save the change.
Changing buttons like a highly paid professional
Customizing Movie buttons? You can do it with aplomb! Follow these steps:
 
1. Click Buttons.
 
2. Click any Movie button from the DVD Menu to select it.
 
 A slider appears above the button, which you can drag to set the thumb-
nail picture for that button in your DVD Menu. (Naturally, this is only for 
animated buttons, not text buttons.)
 
 Enable the Movie check box to animate the button.
 
3. To create a Movie button with a still image, drag a picture from a 
Finder window or the Media pane and drop it on top of the button.
 
4. To adjust the properties for the button, click the Inspector button.
Table 5-1 describes the button properties — note that some properties 
won’t appear for text buttons.

Earlier in this chapter, you find out how to use a different image for your 
background, but what about using an animated background? You can use 
any QuickTime movie from your iMovie library (including those you’ve taken 
with your MacBook’s iSight camera) to animate your DVD Menu background! 
Didn’t I tell you that this iDVD thing was huge?
 
Keep in mind that your background movie should be a short clip; 20–30 sec-
onds is optimal. A clip with a fade-in at the beginning and a fade-out at the 
end is the best choice because iDVD loops your background clip continu-
ously, and your animated background flows seamlessly behind your Menu.
 
I’m not talking drop zones here. (See the sidebar “Taking advantage of drop 
zones,” earlier in this chapter, for an explanation of drop zones.) You can 
add a movie to a drop zone, of course, but by using a movie clip as a back-
ground, you’re replacing the entire animation sequence rather than just a 
single area of the background. Drop zones also don’t provide audio, whereas 
a clip background does include the clip audio.
Follow these steps to add a new animated background:
 
1. Click your old friend, the Inspector button.
 
 Make sure that no individual objects are highlighted so that the 
Inspector window displays the Menu properties instead.
 
2. Drag a movie from the Finder and drop it into the Background well.
 
 You can click the Movies tab in the Media pane to instantly display your 
iMovie collection.

sight. When you click Preview, the Media pane disappears, and your DVD 
Menu appears exactly as it will on the finished DVD.

Ah, but appearances aren’t everything: You can also use your DVD Menu! 
Click the buttons on the remote control to simulate the remote on your DVD 
player or think outside the box and click a Menu button directly with your 
mouse pointer. iDVD presents the video clip, runs the slideshow, or jumps to 
a submenu, just as it will with the completed disc.
This is a great time to test-drive a project before you burn it to disc. To 
make sure you don’t waste a blank DVD, make certain that everything you 
expect to happen actually happens. Nothing worse than discovering that

ily’s summer trip to the zoo (whoops). If you made a mistake or something 
needs tweaking, click the Preview button again, and you’re back to the iDVD 
window proper, where you can edit or fine-tune your project.
 
iDVD allows you to save your project as a standard Mac OS X disc image 
rather than as a simple project file (or a physical DVD) — you can use 
Apple’s Disk Utility to open and mount the disc image as if it were a burned 
disc. If you move the disc image to another Mac with a SuperDrive, you can 
use Disk Utility to burn it on that machine. To save an iDVD project as a disc 
image, choose File➪Save as Disc Image (or press Ô+Shift+R). To save your 
project as a standard VIDEO_TS folder (suitable for burning with another 
video-editing or DVD recording application), choose File➪Save as VIDEO_TS 
Folder.
 
Interested in tweaking settings across your entire project? Perhaps you’d 
like to reduce the time it takes to create and edit your DVD or switch

you’d like to view or change the overall settings for your entire DVD, click 
Project➪Project Info to display the Project Info dialog. Heck, you can even 
switch aspect ratios or change the project name. Thanks, Apple!
A Word about Automation
At the beginning of the chapter, I mention the easy way to produce an iDVD 
disc or project, using either OneStep DVD (for complete automation) or 
Magic iDVD (for partial automation). In this section, I provide you with the 
details.
One-click paradise with OneStep DVD
If you’re in a hurry to create a DVD from clips on your DV camcorder and 
you don’t mind losing your creative input, OneStep DVD is just the ticket. 
In short, iDVD allows you to plug in your FireWire-equipped mini-DV cam-
corder, answer a question or two, and then sit back while the application 
does all the work. iDVD imports the DV clips, creates a basic Menu design, 
and burns the disc automatically! (Again, note that OneStep DVD doesn’t 
support USB camcorders.)
Using OneStep DVD will appeal to any laptop owner with a SuperDrive. Why 
not produce a DVD right after a wedding or birthday that you can give as a 
gift? Photographers who cover those same special events might consider 
selling a DVD made with OneStep DVD. If you happen to capture something 
incredibly unique — such as a UFO landing or an honest politician — you 

392
A Word about Automation
can use OneStep DVD to create an instant backup of the clips on your DV 
camcorder. You could even keep your friends and family up-to-date with 
the progress of your vacation by sending them a daily DVD of your exploits! 
(You gotta admit, even Grandma would consider that eminently sassy!)
Follow these steps to start the OneStep DVD process:
 
1. Click the OneStep DVD button on the iDVD top-level menu (refer to 
Figure 5-2).
 
 Alternatively, choose File➪OneStep DVD. 
 
 iDVD displays the dialog shown in Figure 5-8.
 
Figure 5-8: 
Connect 
your DV 
camcorder, 
and 
OneStep 
DVD does 
the rest.
 
 
 If you want to use OneStep DVD with an existing movie on your 
MacBook’s hard drive, choose File➪OneStep DVD from Movie instead. 
iDVD prompts you for the video file to use.
 
2. Following the prompts, connect the FireWire cable from your DV 
camcorder; then turn on the camcorder and set it to VCR mode.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. Load a blank DVD.
Exercising control with Magic iDVD
Got a little extra time? For those who prefer to make just a few choices and 
let iDVD do the rest, the new Magic iDVD feature just plain rocks! However, 
you can’t import clips directly from your mini-DV camcorder as you can with 
OneStep DVD; instead, you select one of the following:
 
✦ An iDVD theme
 
✦ Video clips you’ve already created with iMovie or dragged from the 
Finder (perfect for use with a USB 2.0 DV camcorder)

and click Burn.
To return to the iDVD main window at any time, just click the Close button 
on the Magic iDVD window.
Recording a Finished Project to a Shiny Disc
When you’re ready to record your next Oscar-winning documentary on 
family behaviors during vacation, just follow these simple words:
 
1. Click the Burn button at the bottom of the iDVD window.
 
 I have to admit, the Burn button that appears has to be my favorite 
single control in all my 20+ years of computing! It looks powerful, it looks 
sexy . . . it wants to burn. (Sorry about that.)
 
2. After iDVD asks you to insert a blank DVD-R into the SuperDrive, load 
a single or dual-layer blank DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, or DVD+RW 
(depending on the media your Mac can handle).
 
 Your SuperDrive might be able to burn and read a DVD+R, DVD-RW, 
or DVD+RW, but what about your DVD player? Keep in mind that only 
DVD-Rs are likely to work in older DVD players. The latest generation 
of DVD players is likely DVD+R compatible as well, but I’ve seen only a 
handful of DVD players that can handle rewriteable media at the time of 
this writing. Therefore, remember the destination for the discs you burn 
and choose your media accordingly.
 
 After a short pause, iDVD begins burning the DVD. The application keeps 
you updated with a progress bar.
When the disc is finished, you’re ready to load it into your favorite local DVD 
player or back into your MacBook and enjoy your work using Apple’s DVD 
Player.
Either way, it’s all good!

W
hen I was a kid, I always thought that real rock stars trashed their 
instruments after a hard night’s worth of jamming — you know, like 
The Who, Led Zeppelin, KISS, and the Rolling Stones. Guitars got set on fire, 
or pounded into the stage, or thrown into the crowd like beads during a 
Mardi Gras parade.
I can make my own music now, but you’ll never see me trash my instrument! I 
compose music on my MacBook with GarageBand, Apple’s music-making 
component in the iLife application suite. You can solo on all sorts of 
instruments, and even add horns, drums, and a funky bass line for backup . . . 
all with absolutely no musical experience (and, in my case, very little talent, 
to boot)!
Oh, and did I mention that GarageBand ’09 also produces podcasts? That’s 
right, you can record your voice and easily create your own show, and then 
share it with others from your iWeb site! Heck, add photos and video if you 
like. You’ll be the talk of your family and friends and maybe even your Mac 
user group.
This chapter explains everything you need to know to create your first song 
(or your first podcast). I also show you how to import your hit record into 
iTunes so that you can listen to it on your iPod with a big, silly grin on your 
face (as I do) or add it to your next iMovie or iDVD project as a royalty-free 
soundtrack.

up to play one part of your song. For example, a track in a classical piece 
for string quartet would have four tracks — one each for violin, viola, 
cello, and bass. This list contains all the tracks in your song arranged so 

Book IV

Shaking Hands with Your Band
that you can easily see and modify them, like the rows in a spreadsheet. 
A track begins in the list, stretching out to the right all the way to the 
end of the song. As you can see in the upper left of Figure 6-1, I already 
have one track defined — a Grand Piano.
 
 If you’re creating a podcast, a Podcast artwork track can also appear. 
Video podcasts can include a movie track as well.
 
✦ Timeline: This scrolling area holds the loops (see the following bullet) 
that you add or record, allowing you to move and edit them easily. 
When a song plays, the Timeline scrolls to give you a visual look at your 
music. (Bear with me; you’ll understand that cryptic statement in a page 
or two.)
 
✦ Loop: This is a prerecorded clip of an instrument being played in a 
specific style and tempo. Loops are the building blocks of your song. 
You can drag loops from the Loop Browser to a track and literally build 
a bass line or a guitar solo. (It’s a little like adding video clips in iMovie 
to build a film.)
 
✦ Playhead: This vertical line is a moving indicator that shows you the 
current position in your song while it scrolls by in the Timeline. You can 
drag the playhead to a new location at any time. The playhead also acts 
like the insertion cursor in a word processing application: If you insert a 
section of a song or a loop from the Clipboard, it appears at the current 
location of the playhead. (More on copying and inserting loops later, so 
don’t panic.)
 
✦ Create a New Track button: Click this button to add a new track to 
your song.
 
✦ Track Info button: If you need to display the instrument used in a track, 
click the track to select it and then click this button. You can also control 
settings, such as Echo and Reverb, from the Edit pane of the Track Info 
display.
 
✦ View/Hide Loop Browser button: Click the button with the striking eye 
icon to display the Loop Browser at the bottom of the window; click 
it again to close it. You can see more of your tracks at a time without 
scrolling by closing the Loop Browser.
 
✦ View/Hide Media Browser button: Click this button (which bears icons 
of a filmstrip, slide, and musical note) to display the media browser 
at the right side of the window; click it again to close it. By closing the 
media browser, you’ll see more of your tracks. If you’re already familiar 
with iDVD, iWeb, or iMovie, you recognize this pane in the GarageBand 
window; it allows you to add media (in this case, digital song files, still 
images or video clips) to your GarageBand project for use in a podcast.
 
✦ Return to Beginning button: Clicking this button immediately moves 
the playhead back to the beginning of the Timeline.

✦ Move Back/Forward One Measure buttons: To move quickly through 
your song by jumping to the previous or next measure, click the 
corresponding button.
 
✦ Play button: Hey, old friend! At last, a control that you’ve probably used 
countless times before — and it works just like the same control on your 
audio CD player. Click Play, and GarageBand begins playing your entire 
song. Notice that the Play button turns blue. To stop the music, click 
Play again; the button loses that sexy blue sheen and the playhead stops 
immediately. (If playback is paused, it begins again at the playhead 
position when you click Play.)
 
✦ Time/Tempo display: This cool-looking LCD display shows you the 
current playhead position in seconds.
 
 You can click the icon at the left of the display to choose other modes, 
such as 
 
• Measures (to display the current measure and mark the beat) 
 
• Chord (to display note and chord names) 
 
• Project (to show or change the key, tempo, and signature for the 
song).
 
✦ Volume slider: Here’s another familiar face. Just drag the slider to raise 
or lower the volume.
Of course, more controls are scattered around the GarageBand window, but 
these are the main controls used to compose a song . . . which is the next 
stop!
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In this section, I cover the basics of composition in GarageBand, working 
from the very beginning. Follow along with this running example:
 
1. Close all existing GarageBand windows.
 
 GarageBand displays the top-level New Project dialog.
 
2. Click New Project on the list at the left.
 
3. Click the Piano icon and click Choose.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Project dialog, as shown in Figure 6-2.
 
 By choosing the Piano, my new GarageBand project will have one track 
already in place — a grand piano. If you choose Electric Guitar or Voice, 
you’ll have a project automatically created with an electric guitar track 
or male and female voice tracks. To create a completely empty project, 
choose Loops.

4. Type a name for your new song and then drag the Tempo slider to 
select the beats per minute (bpm).
 
 A GarageBand song can have only one tempo (or speed) throughout, 
expressed as beats per minute.
 
5. If you want to adjust the settings for your song, you can select the
 
• Time signature (the Time box)
 
• Key (the Key box)
 
 If you’re new to music theory (the rules and syntax by which music is 
created and written), just use the defaults. Most of the toe-tappin’ tunes 
that you and I are familiar with fit right in with these settings.
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
 You see the window shown in Figure 6-1. (The Blues Jazz Piano 01 
section in the middle of Figure 6-1 — which I show you how to add in the 
next section — is an example of a typical loop.)
Adding tracks
Although I’m not a musician, I am a music lover, and I know that many 
classical composers approached a new work in the same way you approach 
a new song in GarageBand: by envisioning the instruments that they wanted 
to hear. (I imagine Mozart and Beethoven would’ve been thrilled to use 
GarageBand, but I think they did a decent job with pen and paper, too.)

400
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
In fact, GarageBand ’09 introduces a Songwriting project (also available from 
the top-level New Project dialog). When you choose the Songwriting project, 
GarageBand presents you with a full set of four instrument tracks, plus a real 
instrument track for your voice. (More on software versus real instrument 
tracks in a page or two.) You’re instantly ready to start adding loops and 
recording your own voice!
 
If you’ve followed along to this point, you’ve noticed two problems with your 
GarageBand window:
 
✦ There’s no keyboard. You can record the contents of a software 
instrument track by “playing” the keyboard, clicking the keys with your 
trackpad. (As you might imagine, this isn’t the best solution.) If you’re 
a musician, the best method of recording your own notes is with a MIDI 
instrument, which I discuss later in the chapter. For now, you can display 
the keyboard window by pressing Ô+K. If the keyboard window is on the 
screen and you don’t need it, banish the window by clicking the Close 
button.
 
 Even if you’re not interested in the “point-and-click” keyboard, 
GarageBand offers a musical typing keyboard, where you press the keys 
on your keyboard to simulate the keys on a musical keyboard. (Hey, if 
you don’t have a MIDI instrument, at least it’s better than nothing.) To 
display the musical typing keyboard window, press Shift+Ô+K.
 
✦ The example song has only one track. If you want to write the next 
classical masterpiece for Grand Piano, that’s fine. Otherwise, on the 
GarageBand menu bar, choose Track➪Delete Track to start with a clean 
slate. (I know, I could have started with a Loops project, but this way 
you get to see how to delete a track.)
 
These are the five kinds of tracks you can use in GarageBand ’09:
 
✦ Software instrument tracks: These tracks aren’t audio recordings. 
Rather, they’re mathematically precise algorithms that your Mac renders 
(or builds) to fit your needs. If you have a MIDI instrument connected to 
your Mac, you can create your own software instrument tracks. (More 
on MIDI instruments later in this chapter.)
 
 In this chapter, I focus on software instrument tracks, which are the 
easiest for a nonmusician to use.
 
✦ Real instrument tracks: A real instrument track is an actual audio 
recording, such as your voice or a physical instrument without a MIDI 
connection. (Think microphone.)

Chapter 6

Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
 
✦ Electric Guitar tracks: GarageBand includes a real instrument track 
especially made for an electric guitar, which allows you to use one 
of five different amplifiers and a number of stompboxes (those effect 
pedals that guitarists are always poking with their foot to change the 
sound of their instruments).
 
✦ Podcast artwork track: You get only one of these; they hold photos that 
will appear on a video iPod (or a window on your iWeb site) when your 
podcast is playing.
 
✦ Movie tracks: The video sound track appears if you’re scoring (adding 
music) to an iMovie movie. Along with the video sound track, you get a 
cool companion video track that shows the clips in your movie. (More 
on this in the “Look, I’m John Williams!” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
Time to add a software instrument track of your very own. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create a New Track button (which carries a plus sign), 
labeled in Figure 6-1.
 
 GarageBand displays the New Track dialog.
 
2. Click the Software Instrument radio button and then click Create.
 
 See all those great instruments in the Track Info pane on the right?
 
3. Choose the general instrument category by clicking it.
 
 I chose Drum Kits.
 
4. From the right column, choose your specific style of weapon, such as 
Rock Kit for an arena sound.
 
 Figure 6-3 illustrates the new track that appears in your list when you 
follow these steps.
If you’re creating a podcast and you want to add a series of still images that will 
appear on a video iPod’s screen (or on your iWeb page), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the View Media Browser button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
 
2. Click the Photos button.
 
 GarageBand displays all the photos in your iPhoto library and Events.
 
3. Drag an image from your iPhoto library in the media browser to the 
Track list.
 
 The Podcast track appears at the top of the Track list, and you can add 
and move images in the list at any time, just like the loops that you add 
to your instrument tracks. (More on adding and rearranging the con-
tents of a track later in this section.)

Figure 6-3: 
The new

Choosing loops
When you have a new, empty track, you can add something that you can 
hear. You do that by adding loops to your track from the Loop Browser — 
Apple provides you with thousands of loops to choose from — and photos 
from your media browser. Click the Loop Browser button (which bears the 
all-seeing eye) to display your collection, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
If your browser looks different from what you see in Figure 6-4, that’s 
because of the view mode you’re using, just like the different view modes 
available for a Finder window. The three-icon button in the upper-left corner 
of the Loop Browser toggles the browser display between column, musical 
button, and podcast sounds view. Click the middle of the three buttons to 
switch to button mode.
Looking for just the right loop
The track in this running example uses a Rock drum kit, but we haven’t 
added a loop yet. (Refer to Figure 6-3.) Follow these steps to search through 
your loop library for just the right rhythm:
 
1. Click the button that corresponds to the instrument you’re using.
 
 In our example, this is the Kits button in the Loop Browser. Click it, and 
a list of different beats appears in the pane at the bottom of the Loop 
Browser window. (Check out Figure 6-4 for a sneak peek.)

2. Click one of the loops with a green musical-note icon.
 
 Go ahead; this is where things get fun! GarageBand begins playing the 
loop nonstop, allowing you to get a feel for how that particular loop 
sounds.
 
 Because I’m using only software instruments in this track (and throughout 
this chapter), you should choose only software instrument loops, which 
are identified by a green musical-note icon.
 
3. Click another entry in the list, and the application switches immediately 
to that loop.
 
 Now you’re beginning to understand why GarageBand is so cool for both 
musicians and the note-impaired. It’s like having your own band, with 
members who never get tired and play whatever you want while you’re 
composing. (Mozart would’ve loved this.)
 
 If you want to search for a particular instrument, click in the Search box 
(labeled in Figure 6-4) and type the text you want to match. GarageBand 
returns the search results in the list.
 
4. Scroll down the list and continue to sample the different loops until 
you find one that fits like a glove.
 
 For this reporter, it’s Southern Rock Drums 01.

404

5. Drag the entry to your Rock Kit track and drop it at the very 
beginning of the Timeline (as indicated by the playhead).
 
 Your window will look like Figure 6-5.
 
Figure 6-5: 
A track 
with a loop 
added.
 
 
If you want that same beat throughout the song, you don’t need to add any 
more loops to that track. (More on extending that beat in the next section.) 
However, if you want the drum’s beat to change later in the song, you add 
a second loop after the first one in the same track. For now, leave this track 
as is.
 
Whoops! Did you do something that you regret? Don’t forget that you 
can undo most actions in GarageBand by pressing the old standby Ô+Z 
immediately afterward.
Second verse, same as the first
When you compose, you can add tracks for each instrument that you want 
in your song:
 
✦ Each track can have more than one loop.
 
✦ Loops don’t have to start at the beginning; you can drop a loop 
anywhere in the Timeline.

You, too, can be a famous composer of 
soundtracks . . . well, perhaps not quite as 
famous as Mr. Williams, but even he had 
to start somewhere. To add a GarageBand 
score to an iMovie, click the Track menu and 
then click Show Movie Track to display the 
Movie track. Choose a movie to score from the 
familiar confines of the Media Browser, and 
drag it to the Movie Track.
At this point, you add and modify instrument 
tracks and loops just as you would any other 
GarageBand project. The existing sound for 
the iMovie project appears in the Movie Sound 
track. A Video Preview pane appears on top 
of the Track Info pane on the right side of the 
GarageBand window. When you click the Play 
button, the video is shown as well so that you 
can check your work and tweak settings (as 
described later in the chapter).
After you’ve finished composing, you can click 
Share on the menu bar and choose to export 
your work to iDVD, as a QuickTime movie 
directly to your hard drive, or to iTunes as a 
movie. Note that you can’t return to iMovie with 
your project, so scoring should be a final step 
in the production of your movie.
Look, I’m John Williams!

Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
 
You put loops on separate tracks so that they can play simultaneously on 
different instruments. If all your loops in a song are added on the same 
track, you hear only one loop at any one time, and all the loops use the same 
software instrument. By creating multiple tracks, you give yourself the elbow 
room to bring in the entire band at the same time. It’s uber-convenient to 
compose your song when you can see each instrument’s loops and where 
they fall in the song.
 
Click the Reset button in the Loop Browser to choose another instrument or 
genre category.
Resizing, repeating, and moving loops
If you haven’t already tried listening to your entire song, try it now. You 
can click Play at any time without wreaking havoc on your carefully created 
tracks. Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it?
But wait: I bet the song stopped after about five seconds, right? (You can 
watch the passing seconds using either the Time/Tempo display or the 
second rule that appears at the very top of the Timeline.) I’m sure that you 
want your song to last more than five seconds! After the playhead moves 
past the end of the last loop, your song is over. Click Play again to pause the 
playback; then click the Return to Beginning button (labeled in Figure 6-1) to 
move the playhead back to the beginning of the song.
The music stops so soon because your loops are only so long. Most are five 
seconds in length, and others are even shorter. To keep the groove going, 
you have to do one of three things:
 
✦ Resize the loop. Hover your cursor over either the left or right edge of 
most loops, and an interesting thing happens: Your cursor changes to a 
vertical line with an arrow pointing away from the loop. That’s your cue 
to click and drag — and as you drag, most loops expand to fill the space 
you’re making, repeating the beats in perfect time. By resizing a loop, 
you can literally drag the loop’s edge as long as you like.
 
✦ Repeat the loop. Depending on the loop that you chose, you might find 
that resizing it doesn’t repeat the measure. Instead, the new part of the 
loop is simply dead air. In fact, the length of many loops is limited to 
anywhere from one to five seconds. However, if you move your cursor 
over the side of a loop that you want to extend, it turns into a vertical 
line with a circular arrow, which tells you that you can click and repeat 
the loop. GarageBand actually adds multiple copies of the same loop 
automatically, for as far as you drag the loop. In Figure 6-7, I’ve repeated 
the bass loop that you see in Figure 6-6.
 
✦ Add a new loop. You can switch to a different loop to change the flow 
of the music. Naturally, the instrument stays the same, but there’s no 
reason you can’t use a horn-riff loop in your violin track (as long as it

sounds good played by a violin)! To GarageBand, a software instrument 
track is compatible with any software instrument loop that you add from 
the Loop Browser as long as that loop is marked with our old friend the 
green musical note.
 
You can also use the familiar cut (Ô+X), copy (Ô+C), and paste (Ô+V) 
editing keys to cut, copy, and paste loops from place to place — both on 
the Timeline and from track to track. And you can click a loop and drag it 
anywhere. After all, you’re working under Mac OS X.
 
Figure 6-7: 
By 
repeating 
the bass 
loop, you 
can keep 
the thump 
flowing.
 
 
Each track can be adjusted so that you can listen to the interplay between 
two or more tracks or hear how your song sounds without a specific track:
 
✦ Click the tiny speaker button under the track name in the list, and the 
button turns blue to indicate that the track is muted. To turn off the 
mute, click the speaker icon again.
 
✦ You can change the volume or balance of each individual track by using 
the mixer that appears next to the track name. This comes in handy if 
you want an instrument to sound louder or confine that instrument to 
the left or right speaker.

408
Composing and Podcasting Made Easy
A track doesn’t have to be filled for every second with one loop or another. 
Most of my songs have a number of repeating loops with empty space 
between them as different instruments perform solo.
Using the Arrange track
GarageBand includes another method you can use to monkey with your 
music: The Arrange track can be used to define specific sections of a song, 
allowing you to reorganize things by selecting, moving, and copying entire 
sections. For example, you’re probably familiar with the chorus (or refrain) 
of a song and how often it appears during the course of the tune. With the 
Arrange track, you can reposition the entire chorus within your song, carrying 
all the loops and settings within the chorus along with it! If you need another 
chorus, just copy that arrangement.
To use the Arrange track, display it by clicking Track➪Show Arrange Track. 
The Arrange track then appears as a thin strip at the top of the track list. 
Click the Add Region button in the Arrange track (which carries a plus sign) 
and you’ll see a new, untitled region appear (as shown in Figure 6-8). You 
can drag the right side of the Arrangement region to resize it, or drag it to 
move it anywhere in the song.

Who wants an arrangement full of regions named “untitled”? To rename an 
Arrangement region, click the word untitled to select it (the Arrange track 
turns blue), and then click the title again to display a text box. Type a new 
name for the region and press Return.
Now, here’s where Arrangement regions get cool:
 
✦ To move an entire Arrangement region, click the region’s title in the 
Arrange track and then drag it anywhere you like in the song.
 
✦ To copy an Arrangement region, hold down the Option key and drag the 
desired region’s title to the spot where you want the copy to appear.
 
✦ To delete an Arrangement region, select it and press Ô+Option+Delete.
 
✦ To replace the contents of an Arrangement region with those of another 
Arrangement region, hold down the Ô key and drag the desired region’s 
title on top of the offending region’s title.
 
✦ To switch two Arrangement regions in your song — swapping the 
contents completely — drag one of the Arrangement region titles on top 
of the other and lift your finger from the trackpad.
Tweaking the settings for a track
You don’t think that John Mayer or U2 just “play and walk away,” do you? 
No, they spend hours after the recording session is over, tweaking their 
music in the studio and on the mixing board until every note sounds just as 
it should. You can adjust the settings for a track, too. The tweaks that you 
can perform include adding effects (pull a Hendrix and add echo and reverb 
to your electric guitar track) and kicking in an equalizer (for fine-tuning the 
sound of your background horns).
To make adjustments to a track, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the desired track in the track list to select it.
 
2. Click the Track Info button (labeled in Figure 6-1).
 
3. Click the Edit tab to show the settings shown in Figure 6-9.
 
4. Click the button next to each effect you want to enable. (The button 
glows green when enabled.)
 
 Each of the effects has a modifier setting. For example, you can adjust 
the amount of echo to add by dragging its slider.

 GarageBand offers a Visual Equalizer window that you can use to create 
a custom equalizer setting for each track. You can display the Visual EQ 
window by clicking the animated button next to the Visual EQ control on 
the Edit pane. To change the Bass, Low Mid, High Mid, or Treble setting 
for a track, click and drag the equalizer waveform in the desired direction. 
And yep, you can do this while your song is playing, so you can use both 
your eyes and ears to define the perfect settings!
 
5. To save the instrument as a new custom instrument — so that you can 
choose it the next time you add a track — click the Save Instrument 
button.
 
6. Click the Track Info button again to return to GarageBand.
Time for a Mark’s Maxim:

Automatic Composition with Magic GarageBand
In a hurry? Too rushed to snag loops and tweak effects? Never fear, 
GarageBand ’09 can even compose a song automatically! The Magic 
GarageBand feature provides a wide range of nine different genres of music 
to choose from — everything from blues to reggae to funk and rock.
To create a song automatically, follow these steps:
As I mention elsewhere in this chapter, 
GarageBand is even more fun if you happen to 
play an instrument! (And yes, I’m envious, no 
matter how much I enjoy the techno and jazz 
music that I create. After all, take away my 
MacBook, and I’m back to playing the kazoo . . . 
at least until I absorb all the Learn to Play 
lessons for the guitar.)
Most musicians use MIDI instruments to play 
music on the computer. That pleasant-sounding 
acronym stands for Musical Instrument Digital 
Interface. A wide variety of MIDI instruments 
is available these days, from traditional MIDI 
keyboards to more exotic fun, such as MIDI 
saxophones. For example, Apple sells a 49-key 
MIDI keyboard from M-Audio for around $100; 
it uses a USB connection to your MacBook.
Most MIDI instruments on the market today 
use a USB connection. If you have an older 
instrument with traditional MIDI ports — 
they’re round, so you’ll never confuse them 
with USB connectors — you need a USB-
to-MIDI converter. You can find this type of 
converter on the Apple Web site for around 
$50. (If you’re recording your voice for a 
podcast, things are easier because you can 
use your MacBook’s built-in microphone; 
however, most podcasting professionals opt 
for an external microphone, which offers better 
fidelity and doesn’t force you to sit directly in 
front of your screen to record.)
After your instrument is connected, you can 
record tracks using any software instrument. 
Create a new software instrument track as I 
demonstrate in this chapter, select it, and then 
play a few notes. Suddenly you’re playing the 
instrument you chose! (If nothing happens, 
check the MIDI status light — which appears 
in the time display — to see whether it blinks 
with each note you play. If not, check the 
installation of your MIDI connection and make 
sure you’ve loaded any required drivers, as well 
as your MIDI settings within QuickTime and the 
input settings in the System Preferences Sound 
pane.)
Drag the playhead to a beat or two before 
the spot in the Timeline where you want your 
recording to start. This gives you time to match 
the beat. Then click the big red Record button 
and start jamming or speaking! When you’re 
finished, click the Play button to stop recording.
Join in and jam . . . or talk!

Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
 
5. When the song fits like a glove, click Create Project to open the song 
as a project in GarageBand.
Now you can edit and tweak the song to your heart’s delight as you can any 
other GarageBand project, adding other software or real instrument tracks 
as necessary.
Sharing Your Songs and Podcasts
After you finish your song, you can play it whenever you like through 
GarageBand. But then again, that isn’t really what you want, is it? You want 
to share your music with others with an audio CD or download it to your 
iPod so that you can enjoy it yourself while walking through the mall!
iTunes to the rescue! As with the other iLife applications that I cover in this 
book, GarageBand can share the music you make through the digital hub 
that is your Mac.
Creating MP3 and AAC files and ringtones
You can create an MP3 or AAC file (or even an iPhone ringtone) from your 
song or podcast project in just a few simple steps:
 
1. Open the song that you want to share.
 
2. Choose Share➪Send Song to iTunes.
 
 GarageBand displays the settings you see in Figure 6-11.
 
 To create a ringtone and send it to iTunes, choose Share➪Send 
Ringtones to iTunes.
 
3. Click in each of the four text boxes to type the playlist, artist name, 
composer name, and album name for the tracks you create.
 
 You can leave the defaults as they are, if you prefer. Each track that you 
export is named after the song’s name in GarageBand.
 
4. Click the Compress Using pop-up menu and choose the encoder 
GarageBand should use to compress your song file.
 
 The default is AAC, but you can also choose MP3 encoding for greater

Until the arrival of GarageBand ’09, you were 
limited to creating music — and if you were a 
nonmusician like yours truly, GarageBand had 
no practical use as a tool for teaching yourself 
how to actually play an instrument.
Ah, but Apple’s introduction of Learn to Play 
actually turns GarageBand into your private 
video tutor for basic piano and guitar! From 
the New Project dialog, click the Learn to 
Play heading to display your lessons. Right out 
of the box, you have an Introduction to both 
instruments, but you can download eight more 
free lessons for each instrument from the 
Lesson Store — and they cover more advanced 
topics such as fingering and chords. Tim, your 
on-screen instructor, can even record what 
you play.
If you find the free Learn to Play lessons 
valuable, you can move up to the Artist 
lessons, which are actually taught by famous 
musicians (including favorites of mine such as 
John Fogerty and Sting, who actually teaches 
you how to play “Roxanne”)! Each Artist lesson 
is $4.99 — well worth the price.
Hey, GarageBand, teach me how to play!

Web Site with iWeb
In This Chapter

✓ Planning your site
✓ Adding a new site and pages
✓ Editing pages
✓ Setting site and page attributes with the Inspector
✓ Publishing sites to the Internet
I
 keep telling everyone who’ll listen: The Web is simple. Or at least it 
should be.
Kids in preschool these days know how to use a browser. Millions of people 
contribute to FaceBook pages, help to create the dynamic reference wonder 
that is Wikipedia, and correspond effortlessly through Web-based e-mail. 
Yet there’s one untamed wilderness that many MacBook owners haven’t 
explored — or even set foot in! That’s the jungle of HTML, the language used 
to create Web pages. Today’s advanced HTML is complex, and it’s not par-
ticularly fun, either. Have you thrown up your hands and declared, “I guess 
I’ll never get my own Web site on the Internet?”
Forget your Web site envy, fellow Mac enthusiast! With iWeb, Apple has pro-
vided a guide through that untamed wilderness . . . and suddenly it’s as easy 
and fun to create a Web site as it is to make a movie or write a song with 
your MacBook. In this chapter, you discover how to design a site, import 
your own photos, and add all sorts of different pages.
Soon, you’ll proudly hold your head up high and declare to the world, “I am 
a Webmaster!”
Looking around the iWeb Window
All of iWeb’s major features and controls fit into a single window, naturally, 
just as it does in iPhoto and iMovie. (I agree with the Apple software designers: 
Multiple windows equals confusing.) Figure 7-1 illustrates the iWeb window, 
complete with a Web site in progress. The stuff to keep your eye on includes:

418
Looking around the iWeb Window
 
Figure 7-1: 
The iWeb 
window 
holds 
everything 
you need 
to put your 
mark on 
the Web.
 
 
✦ Toolbar: Located at the bottom of the window, the iWeb toolbar keeps 
all your major controls one or two clicks away.
 
 The iWeb toolbar contains different buttons, depending on the chore 
you’re handling at the moment. Figure 7-1 shows the set of toolbar but-
tons that you see when you’re editing a page.
 
✦ Layout: You need elbow room to build a Web page, so the Layout sec-
tion of the iWeb interface dominates the window. You create and edit 
your pages in the Layout display and then use it to preview and test-
drive your finished site.
 
✦ Site Organizer: The strip to the left of the layout display is the Site 
Organizer, which allows you to organize your Web sites, add new pages 
to a site, and select an existing page for editing.
Before we get down to business, it’s overview time. You essentially follow 
three phases to put your new site on the Web:
 
1. Decide which pages you need.
 
2. Create a new site and build those pages.
 
3. Publish your site to your MobileMe account (or to a Web server 
using FTP).
I go over each of these phases in order. (They taught me that in college . . . 
along with the history of the Aztecs and the wonders of FIFO accounting.)

Planning Your Pages
Planning Your Pages
Every properly designed Web site has a purpose: to inform, to entertain, or 
to provide downloads or contact information. The pages you add to your 
site should all reflect that common purpose.
iWeb can produce the following types of pages for your site:
 
✦ Welcome: This is the default first page that iWeb adds to a site you 
create. The Welcome page familiarizes your visitor with the idea behind 
your site, and perhaps offers a snippet of the latest developments on the 
site in a “What’s New” paragraph.
 
✦ About Me: This page provides a biography of you or another person, 
listing things like your age, favorite songs, and favorite foods. (After all, 
that’s important stuff.) Links are provided to your photo album pages 
and other Web sites you want to share.
 
✦ Photos: Oh, this is good stuff here — iWeb makes it easy to add one of 
those cool online photo galleries for your snapshots, complete with a 
Web slideshow! You can add Events and albums from iPhoto, too.
 
✦ My Albums: You can organize all your Photos and Movie pages on a single 
My Albums page. Visitors click a thumbnail to jump to the corresponding 
Photos page or Movies page — it’s a visual index done the right way.
 
✦ Movie: Got a QuickTime movie you’ve created with iMovie to share with 
others? This is the page that presents it to your adoring fans.
 
✦ Blog: Adding a Blog (or personal Web journal) page is a somewhat dif-
ferent beast: iWeb keeps track of each addition you make in an entry list 
so that you can quickly add or delete entries without requiring tons of 
scrolling, cutting, and pasting. A Blog page also includes an archive so 
that deleted entries aren’t lost forever.
 
✦ Podcast: Consider a podcast as an audio (or audio/visual) blog — it’s 
designed to be downloaded to a visitor’s iPod or computer for later 
enjoyment. As does the Blog page, a Podcast page has an entry list and 
an archive list attached to it.
 
✦ Blank: Yep, an old-fashioned blank page, ready for you to fill with what-
ever you like.
Before you even launch iWeb, jot down on a piece of paper (or put in a 
Sticky) these important points:
 
✦ What message do I want to communicate to visitors?
 
✦ What tone will I use — funny, informal, or businesslike?
 
✦ What stuff do I want to offer: photos, movies, or podcasts?

420
Adding a New Site
Now you have the starting point for your site and you know what you want 
to include . . . so let’s get down with the Web!
Adding a New Site
When you open iWeb for the first time, the application creates a new site for 
you, and you can rename and modify this default site to your heart’s content. 
In fact, for many of us, one site is all we ever create — but iWeb can easily 
handle multiple Web sites, keeping them separate in the Site Organizer.
If there’s at least one existing site in your Site Organizer, iWeb automatically 
displays the last site you were working on. Therefore, if you want to create 
an entirely new site, you have to perform a little manual labor. Here are a 
number of different ways to add a site:
 
✦ Choose File➪New Site.
 
✦ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Control-click (or right-click) in the Site Organizer and click New Site.
iWeb leaps into action and displays the template sheet you see in Figure 7-2. 
Scroll through the template themes in the list at the left of the sheet until 
you find one that matches the tone you decided on in the previous section. 
(Informal, formal, or silly, iWeb has templates that match every mood!) Click 
a template on the left, and the application automatically updates the page 
type thumbnails on the right.
 
Figure 7-2: 
Choosing a 
template for 
a new site.
 

Book IV
Chapter 7
Crafting a Web Site 
with iWeb
421
Editing a Page
When you choose a template, iWeb automatically provides your pages with 
a common background, color scheme, and fonts so that your finished Web 
site has a common theme throughout.
After you find the right look and feel, click the desired template in the scrolling 
list at the left, click the Welcome page thumbnail, and then click the Choose 
button. iWeb creates a new site heading in the Site Organizer, complete 
with the default Welcome page. Figure 7-1, shown previously, illustrates the 
Welcome page from a new site I created with the Main Event template.
Adding a New Page
Time to add the pages you plan for your site! For example, I’ve decided to 
add Photo and About Me pages to the new site I’ve created. In the following 
section, I discuss how to edit these pages to personalize them . . . but for 
now, I just want you to add the pages.
If you have multiple sites in your Site Organizer list, click the top-level head-
ing for the desired site to select it. You can add pages by
 
✦ Clicking the Add Page button on the toolbar at the bottom of the iWeb 
window
 
✦ Choosing File➪New Page
 
✦ Pressing Ô+N
 
✦ Control-clicking or right-clicking the site header in the Site Organizer 
and clicking New Page
 
Want to start with an existing page as a basis for a new page? Right-click that 
page entry in the Site Organizer and choose Duplicate. iWeb creates a new 
page with exactly the same contents and adds it to the site.
Pages are listed under the main site heading in outline format, making it easy 
to expand or collapse a site by clicking the familiar rotating triangle icon 
next to the site heading. (Apple calls these disclosure triangles. Wowzers!)
Deleting a page — or a whole site, for that matter — is easy in iWeb. Right-
click the offending page or site heading in the Site Organizer and choose 
Delete Page/Delete Site. Note that iWeb doesn’t prompt you for confirmation 
here, so these aren’t commands to toy with.
Editing a Page
If you have your site framework complete, you can actually put your site 
on the Internet as is! Of course, the photos would all be of good-looking 

422
Editing a Page
strangers, and most of the text would read like Pig Latin nonsense. (Come to 
think of it, I’ve been on some real sites that aren’t much better. Go figure.)
I think we both agree, however, that you want to personalize your pages with 
your own information. To begin editing a page, click it in the Site Organizer.
Modifying text
First, update the text with your own information by following these steps:
 
1. Click the text you want to replace.
 
 As do most desktop publishing applications, iWeb uses boxes to enclose 
text. When you click the text, the box appears, with handles that you 
can drag to resize the box.
 
2. Begin typing your text.
 
 iWeb replaces the existing template text with the text you type, using 
the text formatting taken from the template. Don’t forget that you can 
paste text from the Clipboard by pressing Ô+V. To match the text style 
of the template, though, press Option+Shift+Ô+V.
 
 Mistakes are passé in iWeb. To undo your last action, you can always 
press the familiar Ô+Z keyboard shortcut or choose Edit➪Undo.
 
3. Highlight and format your new text as necessary.
 
 To make changes easier, click the Inspector button in the iWeb toolbar. 
The window you see in Figure 7-3 appears, allowing you to change text 
color, alignment, and spacing with aplomb. (You find more about the 
Inspector later.) You can click the Colors or Fonts buttons on the iWeb 
toolbar to display a Color Picker or Font Panel for the selected text.
You would if you were building a Web site by 
hand, or if you were using an old-fashioned Web 
creation application not designed by our favor-
ite company! (Insert smug expression here.)
Let me explain . . . . Every Web site needs a 
series of links called a menu that allows you 
to jump from one page of the site to another. 
(For instance, you’re probably already familiar 
with the “tabbed” menu at the top of the Apple 
Web site that you use to flit from the Mac OS X 
section to the Support section to the Store sec-
tion and back again.) In days of old, a site menu 
was often a nightmare to maintain, especially if 
your site changed often.
iWeb creates and maintains a menu for each 
of your sites automatically and places it at the 
top of your pages for you! (You might have 
noticed that the Welcome menu item already 
appears in Figure 7-1.) When you add or delete 
pages, the application updates your menu in 
the background.
This is the way software is supposed to be 
designed. Don’t you agree?
Don’t I have to slave over a hot menu?

4. Click outside the text box after you’re satisfied with the text.
Because you’re likely modifying everything on the template pages from the 
title to the last box on the page, repeat Steps 1–4 for each section of text you 
want to change.
Replacing images
If your page includes photographs that you want to change, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the image you want to replace.
 
 As it does with a block of text, iWeb displays a box around the image, 
complete with resizing handles.
 
2. Drag an image to the image box from a Finder window.
 
 Alternatively, you can click the Show Media button in the toolbar, 
which displays the Media Browser you see in Figure 7-4. From this 
window, you can click the Photos tab to choose an image from your 
iPhoto library.
 
 You can hide the Media Browser to make more room for your page 
layout. Just click the Hide Media button in the toolbar.

3. Adjust your new image if necessary.
 
 Click the Adjust button, and iWeb displays a cool, semi-opaque dialog 
that allows you to tweak image settings, such as tint, brightness, and 
sharpness (see Figure 7-5). Click Enhance to allow iWeb to choose the 
settings it considers best for the image or click Reset Image to restore 
the photo to its original appearance. When you’re satisfied with the 
image, click the Close button on the dialog to return to the image box.

4. Click outside the image box (usually the page background) after 
you’re satisfied with the photo.
Again, lather/rinse/repeat for each image you want to change on your page.
Adding new elements
iWeb also makes it easy to add new items to a page. The list of extras includes
 
✦ Audio: You can add a song (complete with volume control, Play/Pause 
button, and progress slider) to your page! Either drag an audio file 
from a Finder window to your page, or click the Audio tab in the Media 
Browser to select a song from your iTunes or GarageBand collections. 
You can drag any image to the player that appears. (How about a photo 
of your daughter instead of album art?)
 
✦ Photos: To add a new image box to your page, drag a photo from a 
Finder window to the iWeb layout section. Or, click the Photos tab in the 
Media Browser to choose an image from your iPhoto library, or throw 
caution to the wind and drag an entire Event or an album to your new 
page! iWeb takes care of all the details.
 
✦ Movies: Yep, you guessed it: You can drag a movie clip from a Finder 
window to your page, or click the Movies tab in the Media Browser to 
choose a movie from iMovie or your Movies folder.
 
✦ Text: Choose Insert➪Text or click the Text button in the toolbar.
 
✦ Shapes: Click the Shape button in the toolbar to display the pop-up 
menu and then click the desired shape. (Don’t forget to resize it as you 
desire with the box handles.)
 
✦ Widgets: Click this tab in the Media Browser to insert a widget (a Web 
applet) to your page. For example, HTML Snippet allows you to type 
HTML code directly into place on the page, or paste HTML code that 
you’ve copied from another Web site. You can also insert interactive 
Google Adsense advertisements or a Google Map. To populate the page 
with a MobileMe Gallery, choose the MobileMe Gallery widget and select 
a Gallery you’ve created using the iPhoto MobileMe Gallery feature. (For 
the complete scoop on iPhoto, cruise over to Chapter 3 in this mini-
book.) Other widgets include a countdown timer and YouTube videos.
 
 You can move a widget anywhere on a page by dragging it, and it can be 
resized just as a text box can. 
 
✦ Links: If you’re editing text and you want to insert a Web link, choose 
Insert➪Hyperlink and choose from the menu that appears. You can 
choose to link to another Web page or insert a link that automatically 
sends an e-mail message to the mail address you provide. You can also 
offer a file for downloading.

426
Tweaking with the Inspector
 
 iWeb can automatically detect e-mail and Web addresses that you type 
in a text box, so you don’t have to use the Links menu. To enable this 
feature, choose iWeb➪Preferences and click the Automatically Detect 
Email and Web Addresses check box to select it.
 
✦ Button: Your Web page can include buttons that allow your visitors to 
e-mail you or display the number of hits (visits) your page has received. 
Choose Insert➪Button and click an option to add or remove a specific 
button. (If the menu option is selected, the button appears on your 
page.) Blog and Podcast pages can also offer RSS feeds (for automated 
retrieval of new entries within a Web browser), subscriptions to your 
podcasts, and slideshows.
 
With these tools, you can use the Blank page template to create your own 
new pages. Personally, I prefer to use the professionally designed templates 
offered by Apple as starting points, removing whatever I don’t need and 
adding new content.
Most Web designers would strongly recommend that you use a common 
theme for all the pages within a site (to lend continuity). Of course, you can 
also stick your tongue out at those very same Web designers and select a 
different theme for every page! To select a different theme for a page, open 
the page in iWeb and click the Theme button in the toolbar; then click the 
desired thumbnail from the pop-up menu. Nothing’s lost but the old look of 
the page, so feel free to experiment to your heart’s content.
Tweaking with the Inspector
Earlier, you used the Inspector to change text formatting attributes — 
but this star performer can do much more than just that! To modify page 
characteristics, click the page in the Site Organizer, display the Inspector, 
and click the Page Inspector button, which carries a document icon. These 
Ready to offer a slideshow on your Web site? 
Again, we’re talking automation here! Add a 
Photo page to your site and notice that the Start 
Slideshow button is already in place at the top of 
the page. All you need to do is add the photos to 
the page, using the Media Browser or dragging 
them from a Finder window. When your visitors 
click the Start Slideshow button, all the photos 
on the page are displayed in a pop-up window.
It’s important to note, however, that some 
Windows browsers don’t support this 
Slideshow feature. Other Mac and PC owners 
using Safari can enjoy the show, but don’t 
count on older versions of Internet Explorer (or 
Firefox) to be able to handle it.

settings allow you to change the name of a page; you can also elect to 
include or exclude this page from the site menu, or to drop the site menu 
from this page.
If your site contains a Blog or Podcast page, you can click the RSS button to 
provide an automated RSS (RDF Site Summary) feed to your visitors. (For more 
information on RSS and how it works in Safari, see Chapter 5 of Book VI.)
Publishing Your Web Site
After you finish with a new site — or you’re satisfied with the edits you make 
to existing pages — it’s time to get your masterpiece on the Web! Even the 
best Web site design is worth next to nil if it isn’t available on the Internet, 
and in this last section, I demonstrate how to publish your Web site to your 
MobileMe account or to a separate server maintained by a third party (per-
haps your ISP, your company, or Dave down the street).
As I mention in the “Don’t forget your site properties!” sidebar, you specify 
where your iWeb site will be published from the Site Publishing Settings 
screen. Click the site name in the Site Organizer to display the Publish To 
pop-up menu (Figure 7-6). iWeb offers the following publishing options:
 
✦ Publish to MobileMe: Your site is hosted by Apple as part of your 
MobileMe subscription. The application takes care of everything, 
uploading any changed pages or media.
 
✦ Publish to FTP Server: This publishing option provides you with a com-
pletely different collection of settings on the Site Publishing Settings 
screen. You’ll need to furnish iWeb with your Web server’s FTP settings 
(which should be furnished to you by the host) and your site’s address 
(or URL).
To make global changes to a site, click the site 
name in the Site Organizer. iWeb switches to 
the Site Publishing Settings screen (Figure 7-6), 
where you can change settings such as
 ✓ The name of the site
 ✓ Your contact e-mail
 ✓ Where the site is published (more on this in 
the next section)
 ✓ Password protection for MobileMe sites
You can also verify how much space is avail-
able on your iDisk, which is where iWeb stores 
your Web sites if you’re a MobileMe member. 
Heck, iWeb can even update your Facebook 
profile automatically when you publish your 
site! What will those Apple designers think of 
next?
Don’t forget your site properties!

428
Publishing Your Web Site
 
✦ Publish to a Local Folder: The final publishing option creates a folder 
on your hard drive that contains all the files to display your Web site. 
This is the option to choose if you’re not a MobileMe subscriber and you 
don’t use a third-party hosting service. You can add these files directly 
to your home or business Web server. Once again, you must supply the 
site URL as it will appear on the Internet after you copy or upload the 
site files to the server.
 
Figure 7-6: 
Setting the 
publishing 
method for 
an iWeb 
site.
 
After you’ve set the type of publishing the site will use, it’s time to take care 
of business! Click the site to select it in the Site Organizer and then click the 
Publish Site button on the toolbar. The application takes care of everything 
else, automatically uploading all pages and media (if you choose MobileMe 
or FTP publishing) or saving them on your hard drive (if you chose the Local 
Folder option).
 
In a hurry? You can elect to publish just the changes necessary to update 
your site: Instead of clicking the Publish Site button on the toolbar, click the 
File menu and choose Publish Site Changes.

Chapter 8: No, It’s Not 
Called iQuickTime
In This Chapter
✓ Viewing movies
✓ Listening to audio
✓ Converting media to different formats
✓ Keeping track of your favorite media
✓ Tweaking QuickTime preferences
QuickTime is a set of exciting technologies that gives you access to the 
greatest multimedia experience around. Despite its power, don’t be 
surprised if you don’t even realize that you’re using it sometimes. Built with 
the average Joe in mind, QuickTime Player takes multimedia to new heights 
without forcing its users to become rocket scientists in the process.
QuickTime Can Do That?
QuickTime was created by Apple to perform all sorts of multimedia func-
tions. Although normally associated with movie playback, QuickTime Player 
can do much more. Whether it’s playing movies, audio, animation, or music, 
QuickTime acts as the main engine that drives all your multimedia needs.
 
✦ Media player: QuickTime Player’s main claim to fame is playing all sorts 
of media — and I do mean all sorts. Table 8-1 lists the most popular of 
the media types that QuickTime can play.
 
 The real beauty of QuickTime Player is that it transparently handles 
playback of all these media formats and more. You don’t even really 
have to know what each of these formats is to play them. QuickTime 
Player takes care of that for you.
 
✦ Internet media tool: When it comes to using media from the Internet, 
QuickTime is in a league all its own. In addition to playing the usual 
movies and audio files found on the World Wide Web, QuickTime can 
play (or display) 3-D scenes and animations. As if that weren’t enough, 
QuickTime even lets you interact with some media. For example, with 
QuickTime, you can navigate within 3-D worlds or play Flash games.

*Movies in MOV and AVI formats use a wide range of compression schemes,

play some MOV or AVI movies that you download.
Playing Media with QuickTime
QuickTime makes a world of movies, audio, graphics, and music instantly 
available to you. Whether you want to view professional movie trailers or 
listen to a garage band’s new single, QuickTime faithfully reproduces nearly 
any media format that you feed it.
To launch QuickTime Player, double-click its icon in the Finder. You can 
also launch QuickTime Player from the Finder by double-clicking a media file 
that QuickTime can play. (See Table 8-1 earlier in this chapter for a listing of 
these file types.)
 
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that QuickTime and QuickTime Player 
are the same thing: QuickTime is a technology that hides in the background 
waiting for instructions to do something with media; QuickTime Player is 
an application that uses the QuickTime technologies. You’ll do recording, 
media conversions, playback, and editing with QuickTime Player. What you 
won’t see is the QuickTime technology in action behind the scenes in appli-
cations such as Safari and iTunes.
 
You can also launch QuickTime Player from its oh-so-convenient Dock icon. 
For more on the Dock, read Book III, Chapter 2.
Opening QuickTime movies
To begin viewing and hearing — aw, what the heck, how about absorbing — 
multimedia files, choose File➪Open File from the QuickTime Player application.

Playing Media with QuickTime
This isn’t the only way to open a file with QuickTime Player, though. Some of 
the other ways to open files with QuickTime Player are
 
✦ Drag a file to the QuickTime Player icon in the Dock.
 
✦ Right-click (or Control-click) a movie and choose Open With; then 
choose QuickTime Player from the pop-up menu.
 
✦ Double-click the media file in the Finder. If it has a QuickTime-style 
icon (a blue letter Q), it opens automatically in QuickTime Player.
Operating QuickTime Player
When you open a QuickTime file, QuickTime Player creates a new window to 
display it. All QuickTime Player windows share some common features:
 
✦ Close, Minimize, and Zoom controls: These three controls appear at the 
top-left corner of most windows in Mac OS X. You probably recognize 
them by their colors: red, yellow, and green, respectively.
 
✦ Resize handle: Drag the lower-right corner of QuickTime Player to resize 
its movie for playback. Hold Shift while dragging to break free from 
constrained resizing. If the document contains only sound media, the 
window grows or shrinks in a horizontal direction when you resize it.
 
 Any resizing that you perform makes no changes to the original file. 
QuickTime provides it for your convenience during playback.
Although some window features are common to all QuickTime Player win-
dows, many features depend on the type of media that you wish to play. 
Table 8-2 lists some of the window features that you might find and the 
media types associated with those features.

To make your life easier, QuickTime does a lot of work for you behind the 
scenes each time that it opens a media file. Although you might think that 
there are different combinations of controls in QuickTime Player, the reality 
is that the various media windows are more similar than they are different. 
Figure 8-1 shows the location of various QuickTime Player controls.

Playing media
Playback begins as you might suspect — by clicking the Play button. While a 
file is playing, the Play button toggles to a Pause button. Click that button to 
pause playback, which toggles the button back to Play.

Playing Media with QuickTime
Clicking the buttons with double arrows on them advances the playback 
head at high speed in the direction of the arrows. (Click once to advance 
at 2x speed; click again to increase the speed.). If the file has audio in it, 
you hear the playback at high speed, which sounds like an episode of those 
helium-inhaling Chipmunks. (Remember? Meee, I waaant a hooola hooop.) 
Despite its comical sound, it’s helpful for quickly scanning through a file.
 
You can also advance through the file by dragging the playback head in 
either direction. This action is permissible while the file is playing or when 
it’s stopped. When you drag the playback head, however, you miss out on 
the high-speed sound and video that you would get if you used the buttons.
To adjust the volume of a movie, simply move the volume slider left or right. 
To mute the volume, click the speaker icon to the left of the volume slider.
You can control playback by using the keyboard as well. Table 8-3 summa-
rizes the keyboard shortcuts for playback.

Sometimes you might want to play a piece of media more than once. In these

View➪Loop or press Ô+L. Press Ô+L again to turn off looping.
Movie info
To see more information about the files that you’re playing, ask the expert: 
QuickTime Player. To view basic information about a movie, choose Window➪
Show Movie Inspector or press Ô+I. The resulting window displays the fol-
lowing data:
 
✦ Source: Location of the file
 
✦ Format: Compressor and dimensions of the file

✦ FPS: Preferred rate of playback in frames per second (fps), shown only 
for video
 
✦ Playing FPS: Actual rate of playback in fps (available during playback 
only), shown only for video
 
✦ Data Size: Size of the file
 
✦ Data Rate: Preferred rate of playback (in bytes per second)
 
✦ Current Time: Position of the playback head (in units of time)
 
✦ Current Size: Actual movie dimensions (if you’ve resized the movie 
since opening the file)
These bits and pieces of information are read-only — you can’t change them 
from the Movie Inspector window.
 
If you’d like to share a multimedia file with others from your MobileMe 
home page on the Web, choose File➪Share. After you’ve typed a name and 
description for your new file, you can optionally click the Allow Movies 
to be Downloaded check box to let others download the movie from your 
MobileMe page. Click Publish, and QuickTime automatically takes care of the 
rest. Slick as a wet toad!
Most folks don’t think of QuickTime Player as 
a recording application. That’s because Apple 
provides applications (such as Photo Booth, 
iMovie, and GarageBand) that have long been 
the recording tools of choice in the Mac uni-
verse. However, you can indeed record audio, 
video, and your MacBook’s screen display with 
QuickTime Player, since your laptop is already 
equipped with the proper hardware (a micro-
phone or line-in device for audio, and an iSight 
camera or external video camera for video).
When you’re ready to record, click File and 
choose either New Movie Recording, New 
Audio Recording, or New Screen Recording. 
You can select your input sources, recording 
quality, and saved file location by clicking the 
button with the down arrow. When all the set-
tings are correct, the process itself is a one-
click operation: Click the Big Red Button to 
start and stop recording. QuickTime displays 
both the recording time and the approximate 
hard drive space used so far. ’Nuff said.

Chapter 9: Turning Your MacBook 
into a DVD Theater
In This Chapter
✓ Ensuring that you have what you need to watch DVDs on your laptop
✓ Using the DVD Player software
✓ Unearthing the mysteries of the hidden controls
A
ll the creative capabilities of the Mac OS X digital hub are a lot of fun, 
but at some point, you’ll want to take a break from work. In recent 
years, DVDs have exploded onto the home entertainment scene; because 
of its high fidelity, convenience, and seemingly limitless storage capacity, 
the DVD has taken consumers by storm. The idea of an honest-to-goodness 
theater in your home is now within the grasp of mere mortals (with, coinci-
dentally, merely average budgets). Mac OS X has everything that you’ll need 
to enjoy a night at the movies without ever leaving home. In fact, I highly 
recommend the 17-inch MacBook Pro for those widescreen classics.
The DVD Hardware
Before you watch one second of film, get your setup in order. Playing DVDs 
requires a bit of hardware; fortunately, all recent MacBook models (except the 
MacBook Air) come equipped with the stuff that’s necessary to watch DVDs.
To play DVD movies, you need either an internal DVD-compatible drive in 
your Macintosh or an external DVD drive with a FireWire or USB 2.0 con-
nection. DVD-ROM drives can only play discs, whereas others, such as the 
SuperDrive, can both play and record discs. Either type of drive works fine 
for watching movies on your MacBook.
 
You can watch any standard DVD that you purchase at your local video 
store as well as any DVD that you create with iDVD. (For more on iDVD, read 
Book IV, Chapter 5.)
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
To watch Frodo Baggins, Don Corleone, or James Bond, you need DVD 
player software. Mac OS X comes stocked with the perfect tool for the task: 
DVD Player.

436
The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
Apple’s DVD Player application is included with Mac OS X; you can find 
it within the confines of your Applications folder. But instead of rooting 
through the Finder, you can launch DVD Player an even easier way: Simply 
insert a DVD into the drive. As soon as you do, your MacBook recognizes the 
disc and launches DVD Player by default for you. (Time for another round of 
well-deserved gloating about your choice of personal computer.)
 
This automatic behavior (the DVD playing — not necessarily the gloat-
ing) can be curbed, however. You can control what action Snow Leopard 
takes (if any) when you load a DVD via the CDs & DVDs pane within System 
Preferences. For all the details, visit Book III, Chapter 3.
However you choose to start DVD Player, you’ll notice that it offers two 
windows:
 
✦ Controller: The small, silver-colored, remote control–looking interface 
that holds all the controls for the Player
 
✦ Viewer: The large window where you view your DVD movies
In the default Full-Screen mode, of course, you won’t see the Viewer window, 
and the video will take up the entire screen. The controller appears as a 
floating opaque strip of controls along the bottom of the screen. To display 
the controls, move your mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen. Move 
the cursor to the top of the screen and you can switch chapters and jump to 
bookmarks. (I talk about both later in the chapter.)
If you’re already using a traditional DVD player, you’ll be right at home with 
Apple’s DVD Player. Even if you’ve never used a traditional DVD player, 
you’ll find that it’s not much different from using a software-based audio 
player such as iTunes.
Using the controller
The controller is the command center of the DVD Player software. Arranged 
much the same as a VCR or tape deck’s controls, all the familiar controls are 
present. Check it out in Figure 9-1.

The DVD Player: It’s Truly Shiny
Table 9-1 details the fundamental commands present in the DVD Player 
Controller. Apple software usually has some goodies hidden beneath the 
surface, and DVD Player is no exception. The controls in DVD Player have a 
few functions that might not be obvious to the casual user. These are listed 
in the third column of Table 9-1.

points. That way, you can jump right to the 
scene, say, where the flying monkey guards 
march into the Wicked Witch’s castle in The 
Wizard of Oz. (Or skip that egg-hatching scene 
in Alien that always makes you nauseated.) 
You can navigate to chapters, play the movie 
from the beginning, or check out special bonus 
features (such as trailers and documentaries) 
from the DVD’s main menu. To switch to a dif-
ferent chapter in Full-Screen mode, move your 
mouse to the top of the screen.

Keeping your eyes on the Viewer
As soon as you begin playing with the DVD Player controls, you’ll notice 
activity in the Viewer window, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
Figure 9-2: 
The Viewer 
is the real 
star of Snow 
Leopard’s 
DVD Player.
 
You can think of the Viewer window as a television inside your Macintosh, if 
it helps, but DVD Player goes one step further. Unlike a television screen, the 
Viewer has some nice tricks up its sleeve: For example, you can resize the 
Viewer window by using one of the four sizes listed in the View menu (Half, 
Actual Size, Double Size, Fit to Screen, and Full-Screen sizes). This is useful 
for watching a movie in a small window on your Desktop while you work 
with other applications. You can toggle your Viewer size from the keyboard; 
for example, select Half Size with Ô+0 (zero), Actual Size with Ô+1 (one), 
and Double Size with Ô+2 (two).
If you’re only in it for the entertainment factor, you’ll probably want to resize 
the Viewer to fill the screen. I like to watch movies in Full-Screen mode, 
which you can toggle with the Ô+F keyboard shortcut. If you want to take 
full advantage of all your screen space yet leave the Viewer window on-
screen for occasional resizing, choose Fit to Screen mode with Ô+3 (three).
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
As anyone with a little DVD experience knows, DVDs can do a lot more than 
those archaic tapes that you used to feed your VCR. Apple has included 
several functions that allow you to explore the extra features and content 
provided with a DVD movie.

Controller extras
To use the additional controller features, double-click the small tab at the 
rightmost (or bottom) edge of the DVD Player Controller. After you do, a 
trick drawer slides out, displaying the extra controls. (See Figure 9-3.) You 
can also display or hide the drawer with the Controls➪Open/Close Control 
Drawer menu command or by pressing Ô+] (that’s the right bracket key).
 
Figure 9-3:

Are you interested in fine-tuning the audio from your DVD movies? If so, 
choose Window➪Audio Equalizer, and DVD Player displays a ten-band 
equalizer. (I often use this feature to add extra bass to a concert DVD.) Click 
the pop-up menu at the upper right of the Equalizer window, and you can 
choose a preset (such as Bass Boost or Vocal Boost), or even create your 
own custom audio presets.
Table 9-2 summarizes the functions that you can perform with these addi-
tional controls.

Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
 
Although you won’t find a Bookmark button on the controller, DVD Player 
can set them nonetheless. A bookmark is a spot, like a favorite scene, that 
you specify in a movie so that you can return to it at any time. To set a 
bookmark at the current spot in the movie, click the Controls menu and 
choose New Bookmark, or press Ô+= (the equal sign key). DVD Player even 
allows you to name the bookmark so that it’s easier to remember. To return 
to a bookmark, choose Go➪Bookmarks and click the desired bookmark. (If 
you’re enjoying your movie in Full-Screen mode, move your cursor to the top 
of the screen to use the Bookmarks strip.)
DVD Player preferences
The DVD Player application has a variety of settings that you can access and 
adjust via its Preferences window. To open the Preferences window, choose 
DVD Player➪Preferences. This brings up the Preferences dialog.
This window consists of six panes:
 
✦ Player: Settings that affect how DVD Player operates
 
✦ Disc Setup: Settings for Audio, Subtitles, Language, and the Web
 
✦ Full Screen: Settings that determine your full-screen viewing configuration
 
✦ Windows: Settings for displaying on-screen information during playback
 
✦ Previously Viewed: Settings that determine what happens when you 
load a DVD that you watched already
 
✦ High Definition: Settings that specify how high-definition video is dis-
played on your MacBook
The advantage of these Preference settings is that you can customize your 
copy of DVD Player to match your needs or desires. (Thanks yet again to the 
Cupertino Crowd!)
Player
The Player settings take care of much of the automation within DVD Player.
 
✦ When DVD Player Opens: These two check boxes affect what happens 
when you launch the DVD Player application. You can force DVD Player 
to play in Full-Screen mode and automatically begin playback every time 
you start the application.
 
✦ When DVD Player Is Inactive: If you’re multitasking while watching 
your movie in windowed mode, you can click another window to make 
it active. This check box determines whether DVD Player will automati-
cally pause while you’re working in that other application.
 
✦ When a Disc Is Inserted: Besides automatic playback on startup, you 
can also make DVD Player start playing a disc automatically when the 

Book IV
Chapter 9
Turning Your 
MacBook into 
a DVD Theater
441
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
application is running already. (To illustrate: If this check box is dese-
lected, loading a new disc won’t automatically start it playing if DVD 
Player is already running.)
 
✦ When Playing Using Battery: MacBook owners love this feature, since 
you can conserve power while using DVD Player by selecting this check 
box. The DVD Player will “spin down” the DVD whenever possible, which 
may cause a short delay when you fast forward or rewind.
 
✦ When Muted: Do you answer a lot of telephone calls while you sneak 
a quick DVD movie at work? If so, be sure to enable this option. If you 
have to press the Mute button on your keyboard while a movie is play-
ing, DVD Player automatically adds the subtitles/closed captions so that 
you can keep up with the dialog. Super sassy!
 
✦ During iChat with Audio: Another option for those who like to run mul-
tiple applications simultaneously. If you’re watching a DVD and start an 
audio or video chat in iChat AV, you can choose to either mute the DVD 
audio or pause the DVD playback until you click Play again.
 
✦ When Viewer Is Minimized: Watching a DVD at the office, eh? Enable 
this check box, and DVD Player automatically pauses the movie when 
you minimize the DVD Player window; otherwise, the movie continues 
playing in the tiny Dock icon. (Managers label this feature downright 
sneaky.)
Disc Setup
The second tab of the Player Preferences window consists of these controls:
 
✦ Language: Sprechen Sie Deutsch? DVDs are designed to be multilanguage-
aware. Feel like brushing up on your German, Spanish, or Chinese? You 
can control the language used for the audio, subtitling, and menus in 
this section.
 
✦ Internet: Some DVDs with DVD@ccess support can access information 
on the Internet. Mark this check box to allow that function.
 
✦ Audio: Click this pop-up menu to specify the default audio output 
signal that you’d like to use. You can also choose to disable the Dolby 
dynamic range compression feature, which might enhance the sound 
for two-speaker systems; however, you don’t want to damage the lower-
output speakers on a MacBook, so I recommend that laptop owners 
leave dynamic range compression enabled (unless you’re using external 
speakers).
 
Multiple languages and Web access are not mandatory features of a DVD, so 
don’t be surprised if you see variations of support when it comes to these 
settings.

442
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
Full Screen
These Preference settings control the default screen display settings within 
DVD Player.
 
✦ Controller: I generally like to hide the controller after a defined time of 
inactivity; select the Hide Controller If Inactive for xx Seconds check box 
if you agree. To set the delay period, click in the seconds box and type a 
new value.
 
✦ Displays: These options specify how DVD Player shares your Desktop 
with others: politely or downright rudely. You can choose to automati-
cally dim other monitors while a movie is playing (if you have more than 
one display connected to your Mac), and DVD Player can stay in Full-
Screen mode even if another application actually has the active window. 
Finally, you can choose to remove the menu bar altogether (often called 
kiosk mode), which helps cut down on interruptions and accidents if 
small hands are nearby — and you can optionally allow Snow Leopard’s 
screen saver to appear on the DVD Menu in kiosk mode.
Windows
This pane gives you the chance to configure the behavior of the controller 
and status information for the Viewer window.
 
✦ Options: Mark the Display Status Information check box, and DVD Player 
adds a small text box at the top-left corner of the Viewer window. In this 
text box, you see the name of the last task that you performed with DVD 
Player. For example, click the Stop button to see the word Stop dis-
played in the Viewer on top of the video beneath it. You can also set the 
controller to fade away instead of just disappear — it’s eye candy, but 
doggone it, it’s good eye candy!
 
✦ Closed Captioned: If you do decide to display the closed-caption text 
from a DVD movie, you can click the color buttons to specify the text 
color. You can also choose the font for your text.
Previously Viewed
This pane controls what happens when you load a disc that you’ve seen 
already . . . or perhaps your significant other watched it and didn’t tell you. 
(Insert growling noise here.)
 
✦ Start Playing Discs From: If you have to quit DVD Player for some 
reason, the application is smart enough to remember where you were, 
and you can choose to begin watching from the beginning, from the last 
position (where you were when you stopped the last time), or from a 

Book IV
Chapter 9
Turning Your 
MacBook into 
a DVD Theater
443
Taking Advantage of Additional DVD Features
default bookmark. Alternatively, just select Always Ask, and DVD Player 
will prompt you each time this situation crops up.
 
✦ Always Use Disc Settings For: Select these check boxes to specify 
whether DVD Player should use the same settings you used the last time 
you watched this disc.
High Definition
The final DVD Player Preferences pane specifies how both standard DV 
and high-definition video from a disc you’ve created in DVD Studio Pro are 
displayed within the Viewer window. (As I mentioned earlier, the Viewer 
window size can also be changed from the View menu, but the settings in 
this pane control what defaults DVD Player uses.)
 
✦ For Standard Definition: You can choose to display the actual video 
size by default, or to use the default size provided by the DVD.
 
✦ For High Definition: These options affect how a high-definition video 
signal is displayed. Your choices include the actual video size, a height 
of 720 pixels, and a height of 1,080 pixels.
Don’t forget to click OK to save any changes you make to your DVD Player 
preferences.
After you have your DVD Player customized to your liking, get out the pop-
corn, pull up your favorite recliner, and let the movies roll!

W
hat’s the difference between word processing and desktop publish-
ing? In a nutshell, it’s in how you design your document. Most folks 
use a word processor like an old-fashioned typewriter. Think Microsoft 
Word and a typical business letter. (Yawn.)
On the other hand, a desktop publishing application typically allows you far 
more creativity in choosing where you place your text, how you align graph-
ics, and how you edit formats. I think desktop publishing is more visual and 
intuitive, allowing your imagination a free hand at creating a document.
In this chapter, I show you how to set your inner designer free from the 
tedious constraints of word processing! Whether you need a simple letter, a 
stunning brochure, or a multipage newsletter, Pages ’09 can handle the job 
with ease — and you’ll be surprised at how simple it is to use.
Creating a New Pages Document
Every visual masterpiece starts somewhere, and with Pages, the first stop in 
creating your document is the Template Chooser window. To create a new 
Pages document from scratch, follow these steps:

448
Open an Existing Pages Document
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
 The iWork installation program offers to add a Pages icon to your Dock. 
If you’ll be using Pages often, it’s a good idea to use this option!
 
2. Double-click the Pages icon.
 
 Pages displays the Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1:

Chooser 
window.
 
 
3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left. 
The thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that match 
your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document by using the template you 
selected.
Open an Existing Pages Document
Of course, you can always open a Pages document from a Finder window — 
just double-click the document icon. However, you can also open a Pages 
document from within the program. Follow these steps:

Book V
Chapter 1
Desktop Publishing 
with Pages
449
Touring the Pages Window
 
1. Double-click the Pages icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
 The Open dialog operates much the same as a Finder window in icon, 
list, or column view mode.
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and 
then click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Pages 
document.
 
4. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Pages document that you’ve edited in the recent past, 
things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent, and you can open the 
document with a single click from the submenu that appears.
Saving Your Work
To save a Pages document after you finish it (or to take a break while design-
ing), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 Alternatively, click the button sporting the down arrow to expand the 
Save As sheet. This allows you to navigate to a different location, or to 
create a new folder to store this Pages project.
 
4. Click Save.
Touring the Pages Window
Before we dive into any real work, let me show you around the Pages 
window! You’ll find the following major components and controls, as shown 
in Figure 1-2:
 
✦ Pages list: This thumbnail list displays all the pages you’ve created 
within your document. (For a single-page document, of course, the 
Page list will contain only a single thumbnail.) You can switch instantly 
between different pages in your document by clicking the desired 
thumbnail in the list.

✦ Layout pane: This section takes up most of the Pages window — it’s 
where you design and edit each page in your document.
 
✦ Toolbar: Yep, Pages has its own toolbar. The toolbar keeps all the most 
common application controls within easy, one-click reach.
 
✦ Styles Drawer: This window extension allows you to quickly switch the 
appearance of selected paragraphs, characters, and lists. You can hide 
and display the Styles Drawer from the View menu or from the View 
drop-down menu on the toolbar.
 
✦ Format Bar: This button strip runs underneath the Pages toolbar, allow-
ing you to format selected text, paragraphs, and lists on the fly.

Using Text and Graphics Boxes
Entering and Editing Text
If you’ve used a modern word processing program on any computer — 
including “freebies” such as TextEdit on a Mac or WordPad on a PC — you’ll 
feel right at home typing within Pages. Just in case, however, let’s review the 
high points:
 
✦ The bar-shaped text cursor, which looks like a capital letter I, indicates 
where the text you enter will appear within a Pages document. 
 
✦ To enter text, simply begin typing. Your characters appear at the text 
cursor.
 
✦ To edit existing text in your Pages document, click the insertion cursor 
at any point in the text and drag the insertion cursor across the charac-
ters to highlight them. Type the replacement text, and Pages automati-
cally replaces the existing characters with the ones you type.
 
✦ To delete text, click and drag across the characters to highlight them; 
then press Delete.
Using Text and Graphics Boxes
Within Pages, text and graphics appear in boxes, which can be resized by 
clicking and dragging on one of the handles that appear around the edges of 
the box. (Hover your cursor over one of the square handles and you’ll see 
that it changes to a double-sided arrow, indicating that Pages is ready to 
resize the box.)
You can also move a box, including all the stuff it contains, to another loca-
tion within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and drag the box 
to the desired spot. Note that Pages displays blue alignment lines to help 
you align the box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions 
of the page, such as the vertical center of a poster or flyer). Figure 1-3 illus-
trates a box containing text that I’m moving; note the vertical alignment line 
that automatically appears.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you must first click the box to select 
it and then click again on the line of text or the graphic that you want to 
change.

The Three Amigos: Cut, Copy, and Paste
“Hang on, Mark, you’ve covered moving stuff, but what if you want to copy 
a block of text or a photo to a second location? Or how about cutting some-
thing from a document open in another application?” Good questions, dear 
reader! That’s when you can call on the power of the cut, copy, and paste 
features within Pages. The next few sections explain how you do these 
actions.
Cutting stuff
Cutting selected text or graphics removes it from your Pages document and 
places that material within your Clipboard. (Think of the Clipboard as a 
holding area for snippets of text and graphics that you want to manipulate.) 
To cut text or graphics, select some material and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Cut.
 
✦ Press Ô+X.
If you simply want to remove the selected material from your Pages docu-
ment (and you don’t plan to paste it somewhere else), just select the text 
and press the Delete key.

Formatting Text the Easy Way
Copying text and images
When you copy text or graphics, the original selection remains untouched, 
but a copy of the selection is placed in the Clipboard. Select some text or 
graphics and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
✦ Press Ô+C.
 
If you cut or copy a new selection into the Clipboard, it erases what was 
there. In other words, the Clipboard holds only the latest material you cut or 
copied.
Pasting from the Clipboard
Are you wondering what you can do with all that stuff that’s accumulating 
in your Clipboard? Pasting the contents of the Clipboard places the mate-
rial at the current location of the insertion cursor. You can repeat a paste 
operation as often as you like because the contents of the Clipboard aren’t 
cleared. However, remember that the Clipboard holds only the contents of 
your last copy or cut operation, so you must paste the contents before you 
cut or copy again to avoid losing what’s in the Clipboard.
To paste the Clipboard contents, click the insertion cursor at the location 
you want and do one of the following:
 
✦ Choose Edit➪Paste.
 
✦ Press Ô+V.
Formatting Text the Easy Way
If you feel that some (or all) of the text in your Pages document needs a face-
lift, you can format that text any way you like. Formatting lets you change 
the color, font family, character size, and attributes as necessary.
After the text is selected, you can apply basic formatting in two ways:
 
✦ Use the Format bar. The Format bar appears directly underneath the 
Pages toolbar, as shown in Figure 1-2. Click to select a font control to 
display a pop-up menu and then click your choice. For example, click 
the Font Family button and you can change the font family from Arial to 
a more daring font. You can also select characteristics such as the font’s 
background color (perfect for “highlighting” items) or choose italicizing 
or bolding. The Format Bar also provides buttons for text alignment 
(Align Left, Center, Align Right, and Justify).

454
Adding a Spiffy Table
 
✦ Use the Format menu. Most controls on the Format Bar are also avail-
able from the Format menu. Click Format and hover the mouse cursor 
over the Font menu item, and you can then apply bolding, italicizing, 
and underlining to the selected text. You can also make the text bigger 
or smaller. To change the alignment from the Format menu, click Format 
and hover the mouse cursor over the Text menu item.
Adding a Spiffy Table
In the world of word processing, a table is a grid that holds text or graphics 
for easy comparison. Many computer owners think of a spreadsheet pro-
gram like Numbers when they think of a table (probably because of the rows 
and columns layout used in a spreadsheet), but you can create a custom 
table layout within Pages with a few simple mouse clicks.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor at the location where you want the table to 
appear.
 
2. Click the Table button on the Pages toolbar.
 
 Pages inserts a simple table and displays the Table Inspector. (Both are 
visible in Figure 1-4.)
 
 
By default, Pages creates a table with three rows and three columns, 
with an extra row for headings at the top. You can change this layout 
from the Table Inspector — just click in the Body Rows or Body 
Columns box and type a number.
 
3. Click within a cell in the table to enter text. The table cell automati-
cally resizes and “wraps” the text you enter to fit. 
 
 You can paste material from the Clipboard into a table. See the earlier 
section “Pasting from the Clipboard” for details on pasting.
 
4. To change the borders on a cell, click the cell to select it and then 
click one of the Cell Border buttons to change the border.
 
 Select a range of multiple cells in a table by holding down Shift as 
you click. Hold down Ô and click to select multiple cells that aren’t 
contiguous.
 
5. To add a background color (or even fill cells with an image for a back-
ground), click the Cell Background pop-up menu and choose a type of 
background.

Adding Alluring Photos
You can choose from two methods of adding a picture within your Pages 
document: as a floating object, meaning that you can place the image in a 
particular spot and it doesn’t move, even if you make changes to the text; 
and as an inline object, which flows with the surrounding text as you make 
layout changes.
 
✦ Add a floating object. Drag an image file from a Finder window and 
place it at the spot you want within your document. Alternatively, you 
can click the Media button on the toolbar and click Photos, navigate to 
the location where the file is saved, and drag the image thumbnail to the 
spot you want in the document. Figure 1-5 illustrates the Media Browser 
in action.
 
 Note that a floating object (such as a shape or image) can be sent to the 
background, where text will not wrap around it. To bring a background 
object back as a regular floating object, click the object to select it and 
click Arrange➪Bring Background Objects to Front. (More about back-
ground objects later in this chapter.)

456
Adding Alluring Photos
 
Figure 1-5:

✦ Add an inline object. Hold down the Ô key as you drag an image file 
from a Finder window and place it where you want within your docu-
ment. You can also click the Media toolbar button and click Photos to 
display the Media Browser. Navigate to the location where the file is 
saved, hold down the Ô key, and drag the image thumbnail to the spot 
where you want it in the document.
If you add an image that appears too large or 
distorted within your Pages document, you 
can resize it at any time to correct the prob-
lem. To resize an image object, click the image 
to select it and then drag one of the selection 
handles that appear along the border of the 
image. (They look like tiny squares.) The side-
selection handles drag only that edge of the 
frame, whereas the corner-selection handles 
resize both adjoining edges of the selection 
frame.
When you hold down the Shift key as you drag, 
Pages preserves the aspect ratio of the image 
so that the vertical and horizontal proportions 
remain fixed.
You can also flip images. Click Arrange on the 
Pages menu bar to flip the image horizontally 
or vertically.

Are You Sure about That Spelling?
Adding a Background Shape
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want. 
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Pages toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.
 
3. Click the center of the shape and drag it to a new spot.
 
 Shapes can be resized or moved in the same manner as image boxes.
 
4. Before you can type over a shape, remember to select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send Object to Background. 
Are You Sure about That Spelling?
Pages can check spelling as you type (the default setting) or check it after 
you complete your document. If you find automatic spell-checking distract-
ing, you should definitely pick the latter method.
To check spelling as you type, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Edit and hover the cursor over the Spelling menu item.
 
2. Click Check Spelling As You Type in the submenu that appears.
 
 If a possible misspelling is found, Pages underlines the word with a red, 
dashed line. 
 
3. Right-click the word to choose a possible correct spelling from the list, 
or you can ignore the word if it’s spelled correctly.
 
To turn off automatic spell checking, click the Check Spelling As You Type 
menu item again to deselect it.
To check spelling manually, follow these steps:
 
1. Click within the document to place the text insertion cursor where the 
spell check should begin. 
 
2. Click Edit and hover the mouse cursor over the Spelling menu item; 
then choose Check Spelling from the submenu that appears. 
 
3. Right-click any possible misspellings and choose the correct spelling, 
or choose Ignore if the word is spelled correctly.

Printing Your Pages Documents
Printing Your Pages Documents
Ready to start the presses? You can print your Pages document on real 
paper, of course, but don’t forget that you can also save a tree by creating an 
electronic, PDF-format document instead of a printout. (For the lowdown on 
PDF printing, visit Chapter 4 in Book VIII.)
To print your Pages document on old-fashioned paper, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Pages, click File and choose Print.
 
 Pages displays the Print sheet you see in Figure 1-6. (Some settings may 
vary depending on your printer’s specific features.)
 
2. Click in the Copies field and enter the number of copies you need.
 
3. Select the pages to print.
 
• To print the entire document, select All.
 
• To print a range of selected pages, select the From radio button and 
enter the starting and ending pages.
 
4. Click the Print button to send the document to your printer.

Sharing That Poster with Others
Sharing That Poster with Others
Besides printing — which is, after all, so passé — you can choose to share 
your Pages document electronically in a number of ways:
 
✦ Sharing on iWork.com. Apple provides a Web site, iwork.com, where 
you can invite others to view and comment on your Pages document. 
Click the iWork.com button on the Pages toolbar to get started, and the 
site will walk you through the rest of the process.
 
 You’ll need an Internet connection to use iWork.com (naturally), as well 
as an Apple ID and a working Apple Mail account. If you didn’t create 
an Apple ID when buying your MacBook or installing Snow Leopard, 
you can save the day by clicking the Create New Account button on 
the iWork.com site. If you’re not using Apple Mail yet, peruse Book VI, 
Chapter 2 for all the details.
 
✦ Sharing through e-mail. Click Share➪Send via Mail, and you can choose 
to add your Pages document to a Mail message in three different for-
mats: as a native Pages document file, as a Word format document, or 
as a PDF file. After you’ve selected a format, Pages obligingly launches 
Apple Mail for you automatically and creates a new message, ready for 
you to address and send!
 
✦ Sharing through iWeb. Again, click the Share menu, but this time 
choose Send to iWeb. Pages automatically opens the iWeb site you last 
edited and provides your Pages document as a native Pages document 
file or as a PDF file. (If your visitors may be using PCs or Linux, choose 
the PDF option.)
 
✦ Exporting. Don’t forget that Pages can export your work in one of four 
different formats: a PDF document; a Word format document; an RTF 
(Rich Text Format) file; or even plain text. Click Share➪Export, pick your 
format, click Next, and then select the location where Pages should save 
the file. Click Export and sit back while your favorite desktop publishing 
application does all the work.
 
 To keep your document as close to how it appears in Pages as possible, 
I recommend either PDF or Word. Your document will retain far more of 
your original formatting than an RTF or plain-text document would.

Chapter 2: Creating Spreadsheets 
with Numbers
In This Chapter
✓ Opening, saving, and creating spreadsheets
✓ Selecting cells
✓ Entering and editing cell data
✓ Formatting cells
✓ Adding and removing rows and columns
✓ Creating simple calculations
✓ Adding charts to your spreadsheets
✓ Printing a Numbers spreadsheet
A
re you downright afraid of spreadsheets? Does the idea of building a 
budget with charts and all sorts of fancy graphics send you running 
for the safety of the hall closet? Well, good MacBook owner, Apple has once 
again taken something that everyone else considers super-complex and 
turned it into something that normal human beings can use! (Much as Apple 
did with video editing, songwriting, and Web site creation — heck, is there 
any type of software that Apple designers can’t make intuitive and easy 
to use?)
In this chapter, I get to demonstrate how Numbers can help you organize 
data, analyze important financial decisions, and yes, even maintain a house-
hold budget! You’ll soon see why the Numbers spreadsheet program is 
specifically designed with the home Mac owner in mind.
Before We Launch Numbers . . .
Just in case you’re not familiar with applications like Numbers and 
Microsoft Excel — and the documents they create — let me provide you 
with a little background information.
A spreadsheet organizes and calculates numbers by using a grid system of 
rows and columns. The intersection of each row and column is a cell, and 
cells can hold either text or numeric values (along with calculations that are 
usually linked to the contents of other, surrounding cells).

462
Creating a New Numbers Document
Spreadsheets are wonderful tools for making decisions and comparisons 
because they let you “plug in” different numbers — such as interest rates or 
your monthly insurance premium — and instantly see the results. Some of 
my favorite spreadsheets that I use regularly include
 
✦ Car and mortgage loan comparisons
 
✦ A college planner
 
✦ My household budget (not that we pay any attention to it)
Creating a New Numbers Document
As does Pages, the desktop publishing application that’s included in iWork 
’09, Numbers ships with a selection of templates that you can modify quickly 
to create a new spreadsheet. (For example, after a few modifications, you 
can easily use the Budget, Loan Comparison, and Mortgage templates to 
create your own spreadsheets!)
To create a spreadsheet project file, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Applications folder and double-click the iWork ’09 folder 
to display its contents.
 
2. Double-click the Numbers icon.
 
 Numbers displays the Template Chooser window you see in Figure 2-1.
 
 If Numbers will be a favorite application on your MacBook, I highly 
recommend that you allow the iWork ’09 installation program to add a 
Numbers icon to your Dock.
 
3. Click the type of document you want to create in the list to the left.
 
 The document thumbnails on the right are updated with templates that 
match your choice.
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document using the template you 
selected.
Opening an Existing Spreadsheet File
If a Numbers document appears in a Finder window, you can just double-
click the Document icon to open it; Numbers automatically loads and dis-
plays the spreadsheet.

However, it’s equally easy to open a Numbers document from within the pro-
gram. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the Numbers icon to run the program.
 
2. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
3. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog and 
then click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the desired 
Numbers document.
 
4. Double-click the spreadsheet to load it.
 
If you want to open a spreadsheet you’ve been working on over the last few 
days, click File➪Open Recent to display Numbers documents that you’ve 
worked with recently.
 
The Template Chooser window also sports both an Open Recent button and 
an Open Existing File button. Convenience is A Good Thing!

464
Save Those Spreadsheets!
Save Those Spreadsheets!
If you’re not a huge fan of retyping data, I always recommend that you save 
your spreadsheets often (just in case of a power failure or a co-worker’s mis-
take). Follow these steps to save your spreadsheet to your hard drive:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the Save As 
sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new spreadsheet.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the file.
 
 This allows you to select common locations, such as your desktop, 
Documents folder, or Home folder.
 
 If the location you want isn’t listed in the Where pop-up menu, you can 
also click the down-arrow button next to the Save As text box to display 
the full Save As dialog. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the 
left of the dialog and then click folders and subfolders until you reach 
the desired location. You can also create a new folder in the full Save 
As dialog.
 
4. Click Save.
After you’ve saved the file the first time, you can simply press Ô+S in the 
future and your changes are saved.
Exploring the Numbers Window
Apple has done a great job of minimizing the complexity of the Numbers 
window. Figure 2-2 illustrates these major points of interest:
 
✦ Sheets list: Because a Numbers project can contain multiple spread-
sheets, they’re displayed in the Sheets list at the left of the window. To 
switch between spreadsheets in a project, click the top-level headings 
(each of which has a spreadsheet icon).
 
✦ Sheet canvas: Numbers displays the rows and columns of your spread-
sheet in this section of the window; you enter and edit cell values within 
the sheet canvas.
 
✦ Toolbar: The Numbers toolbar keeps the most common commands 
you’ll use within easy reach.
 
✦ Formula Box: You’ll use the Formula Box to enter formulas into a cell, 
allowing Numbers to automatically perform calculations based on the 
contents of other cells.

✦ Format Bar: Located directly under the toolbar, the Format Bar dis-
plays editing controls for the object that’s currently selected. (If you 
enter an equal sign into the Formula Box, the Format Bar changes into 
the Formula Bar. No, I’m not making this up.) My goodness, this is 
starting to sound like that classic movie about the chocolate tycoon 
and those kids!

Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet
Before you can enter data into a cell, you need to know how to get to the 
cell where you want to enter that data. You can use the scroll bars to move 
around in your spreadsheet, but when you enter data into cells, moving your 
fingers from the keyboard is a hassle. For this reason, Numbers has vari-
ous movement shortcut keys that you can use to navigate, and I list them in 
Table 2-1. After you commit these keys to memory, your productivity shoots 
straight to the top.

✦ To select a range of multiple adjacent cells, click a cell at any corner of 
the range you want and then drag the mouse in the direction you want.
 
✦ To select a column of cells, click the alphabetic heading button at the 
top of the column.
 
✦ To select a row of cells, click the numeric heading button on the far left 
side of the row.
Entering and Editing Data in a Spreadsheet
After you navigate to the cell in which you want to enter data, you’re ready 
to type your data. Follow these steps to enter That Important Stuff:
 
1. Either click the cell or press the spacebar.
 
 A cursor appears, indicating that the cell is ready to hold any data you 
type.
 
2. Type in your data.
 
 Spreadsheets can use both numbers and text within a cell — either type 
of information is considered data in the Spreadsheet World.

Aligning Cell Text Just So
 
3. To edit data, click within the cell that contains the data to select it and 
then click the cell again to display the insertion cursor. Drag the inser-
tion cursor across the characters to highlight them and then type the 
replacement data.
 
4. To simply delete characters, highlight the characters and press Delete.
 
5. When you’re ready to move on, press Return (to save the data and 
move one cell down) or press Tab (to save the data and move one cell 
to the right).
Selecting the Right Number Format
After your data has been entered into a cell, row, or column, you still might 
need to format it before it appears correctly. Numbers gives you a healthy 
selection of formatting possibilities. Number formatting determines how a 
cell displays a number, such as a dollar amount, a percentage, or a date. 
 
Characters and formatting rules, such as decimal places, commas, and dollar 
and percentage notation, are included in number formatting. So, if your 
spreadsheet contains units of currency, such as dollars, format it as such. 
Then all you need to do is type the numbers, and the currency formatting is 
applied automatically. 
To specify a number format, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
2. Click the Inspector toolbar button.
 
3. Click the Cells Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 2-3.
 
4. Click the Cell Format pop-up menu and click the type of formatting 
you want to apply.
Aligning Cell Text Just So
You can also change the alignment of text in the selected cells. (The default 
alignment for text is flush left and for numeric data, flush right.) Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format.
 
 See “Navigate and Select Cells in a Spreadsheet,” earlier in this chapter, 
for tips on selecting stuff.

3. Click the Text Inspector button in the Inspector toolbar to display the 
settings you see in Figure 2-4.
 
4. Click the corresponding alignment button to choose the type of for-
matting you want to apply.
 
 You can choose left, right, center, justified, and text left and numbers 
right. Text can also be aligned at the top, center, or bottom of a cell.
 
I would be remiss if I didn’t point out that you can also select the cells you 
want to align and click the appropriate alignment button in the Format Bar. 
(Leave it to Apple to provide multiple ways of doing the same job!)
 
Do you need to set apart the contents of some cells? For example, you might 
need to create text headings for some columns and rows or to highlight 
the totals in a spreadsheet. To change the formatting of the data displayed 
within selected cells, select the cells, rows, or columns you want to format 
and then click the Font Family, Font Size, or Font Color buttons on the 
Format Bar.

Insert and Delete Rows and Columns
What’s that? You forgot to add a row and now you’re three pages into your 
data entry? No problem. You can easily add or delete rows and columns. 
Really — you can! First, select the row or column that you want to delete or 
that you want to insert a row or column next to, and do one of the following:
 
✦ For a row: Right-click and choose Add Row Above, Add Row Below, or 
Delete Row from the shortcut menu that appears.
 
✦ For a column: Right-click and choose Add Columns Before, Add 
Columns After, or Delete Column from the shortcut menu that appears.
Remember that you can also take care of this business from the Table menu. 
(Personally, I like to right-click.)

The Formula Is Your Friend
The Formula Is Your Friend
Sorry, but it’s time to talk about formulas. These equations calculate values 
based on the contents of cells you specify in your spreadsheet. For example, 
if you designate cell A1 (the cell in column A at row 1) to hold your yearly 
salary and cell B1 to hold the number 12, you can divide the contents of cell 
A1 by cell B1 (to calculate your monthly salary) by typing this formula into 
any other cell:
=A1/B1
By the way, formulas in Numbers always start with an equal sign (=).
“So what’s the big deal, Mark? Why not use a calculator?” Sure, but maybe 
you want to calculate your weekly salary. Rather than grab a pencil and 
paper, you can simply change the contents of cell B1 to 52, and — boom! — 
the spreadsheet is updated to display your weekly salary.
That’s a simple example, of course, but it demonstrates the basis of using 
formulas (and the reason that spreadsheets are often used to predict trends 
and forecast budgets). It’s the “what if?” tool of choice for everyone who 
works with numeric data.
To add a simple formula within your spreadsheet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell that will hold the result of your calculation.
 
2. Click inside the Formula Box and type = (the equal sign).
 
 The Formula Box appears to the right of the Sheets heading, directly 
under the Button bar. Note that the Format Bar changes to show a set of 
formula controls (a.k.a. the Formula Bar).
 
3. Click the Function Browser button, which bears the fx label. (It 
appears next to the red Cancel button on the Formula Bar.)
 
4. In the window that appears, as shown in Figure 2-6, click the desired 
formula and click Insert to add it to the Formula Box.
 
5. Click an argument button in the formula and click the cell that con-
tains the corresponding data.
 
 Numbers automatically adds the cell you indicated to the formula. 
Repeat this for each argument in the formula.
 
6. After you finish, click the Accept button to add the formula to the cell.
That’s it! Your formula is now ready to work behind the scenes, doing math 
for you so that the correct numbers appear in the cell you specified.

Adding Visual Punch with a Chart
Sometimes you just have to see something to believe it — hence the ability 
to use the data you add to a spreadsheet to generate a professional-looking 
chart! Follow these steps to create a chart:
 
1. Select the adjacent cells you want to chart by dragging the mouse.
 
 To choose individual cells that aren’t adjacent, you can hold down the 
Ô key as you click.
 
2. Click the Charts button on the Numbers toolbar. The Charts button 
bears the symbol of a bar graph.
 
 Numbers displays the thumbnail menu you see in Figure 2-7.

you can move the chart. You can drag using the handles that appear on 
the outside of the object box to resize your chart. Figure 2-8 illustrates 
the 3-D chart I generated with just a couple of mouse clicks.
 
 Click the Inspector toolbar button and you can switch to the Chart 
Inspector dialog, where you can change the colors and add (or remove) 
the chart title and legend.
 
4. To change the default title, click the title box once to select it; click it 
again to edit the text.
After you’ve added your chart to the sheet, you’ll note that it appears in the 
Sheets list, as also shown in Figure 2-8. To edit the chart at any time, just 
click on the corresponding entry in the Sheets list.

t seems like only yesterday that I was giving business presentations with 
a clunky overhead projector and black-and-white acetate transparencies. 
Fancy color gradients and animation were unheard of, and the only sound 
my presentations made was the droning of the projector’s fan. I might as 
well have been using tree bark and chalk.
Thank goodness those days are gone forever, because cutting-edge pre-
sentation software like Keynote makes slide creation easy and — believe 
it or not — fun! This is the application that Steve Jobs once used for his 
Macworld keynotes every year, and there’s so much visual candy available 
that you’ll never need to shout to wake your audience again. Naturally, 
Keynote is a perfect match for your MacBook, allowing you to create or 
edit a presentation while you’re on the road.
In this chapter, I demonstrate how simple it is to build a stunning Keynote 
presentation, and how to start and control your slide display from your 
keyboard (or even your iPhone or iPod touch). Heck, we’ll even print your 
slides and notes so that your audience can keep a copy of your brilliant 
work!

Creating a New Keynote Project
Creating a New Keynote Project
As do the other applications in the iWork ’09 suite, Keynote begins the docu-
ment creation process with a Template Chooser window. To create a new 
presentation project, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click your hard drive icon and click the Applications entry in 
the Finder window sidebar. Double-click the iWork folder to open it.
 
 If presentations are your bread and butter, allow the iWork installation 
program to add a Keynote icon to your Dock. Your clicking finger will 
thank you.
 
2. Double-click the Keynote icon.
 
 The Template Chooser window that you see in Figure 3-1 appears. (I 
have to say that these are probably the most stunning visual building 
blocks I’ve ever seen in a presentation application. You should have 
heard the “oohs” and “ahhs” from the Macworld faithful when Steve 
Jobs demonstrated Keynote for the first time on the big screen!)

Saving Your Presentation
 
 Although you don’t necessarily need to select an exact match for the 
screen resolution of your MacBook, it’s a good idea to select the closest 
value to the maximum resolution of your projector. (If someone else is 
providing the projector, the default value of 1024 x 768 is a good stan-
dard to use.)
 
4. Click the template that most closely matches your needs.
 
5. Click Choose to open a new document by using the template you 
selected.
Opening a Keynote Presentation
If an existing Keynote presentation file is visible in a Finder window, you can 
double-click the document icon to open the project. If Keynote is already 
running, however, follow these steps to load a project:
 
1. Press Ô+O to display the Open dialog.
 
2. Click the desired drive in the Devices list at the left of the dialog; then 
click folders and subfolders until you’ve located the Keynote project.
 
3. Double-click the filename to load it.
 
If you want to open a Keynote document that you’ve edited in the recent 
past, things get even easier! Just click File➪Open Recent and you can open 
the document with a single click from the submenu that appears. (Note that 
the Template Chooser window has both Open Recent and Open Existing File 
buttons as well.)
Saving Your Presentation
When you’re done working on a Keynote presentation (or if you’d simply like 
to safeguard your work in a world of power failures), follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ô+S.
 
 If you’re saving a document that hasn’t yet been saved, the familiar Save 
As sheet appears.
 
2. Type a filename for your new document.
 
3. Click the Where pop-up menu and choose a location to save the 
document.
 
 To select a location not on the Where pop-up menu, click the button 
with the down arrow symbol to expand the sheet. You can also create a 
new folder from the expanded sheet.
 
4. Click Save.

Putting Keynote to Work
Putting Keynote to Work
Ready for the 5-cent tour of the Keynote window? Launch the application 
and create or load a project, and you’ll see the tourist attractions shown in 
Figure 3-2:
 
✦ Slide list: Use this thumbnail list of all the slides in your project to help 
you navigate quickly. Click a thumbnail to switch instantly to that slide.
 
 The Slide list can also display your project in outline format, allowing 
you to check all your discussion points. (This is a great way to ferret out 
any “holes” in your presentation’s flow.) While in outline mode, you can 
still jump directly to any slide by clicking the slide’s title in the outline. 
To display the outline, click View➪Outline. You can switch back to the 
default Navigator Slide list by clicking View➪Navigator.
 
✦ Layout pane: Your slide appears in its entirety in this pane. You can add 
elements and edit the content of the slide from the Layout pane.

Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
 
✦ Toolbar: As does the toolbar in Pages and Numbers, Keynote’s toolbar 
makes it easy to find the most common controls you’ll use while design-
ing and editing your slides. Clicking an icon in the toolbar performs an 
action, just as selecting a menu item does.
 
✦ Notes pane: If you decide to add notes to one or more slides (either for 
your own use or to print as additional information for your audience), 
click View➪Show Presenter Notes to open the Notes pane. This text box 
appears under the Layout pane.
 
✦ Format Bar: Keynote displays this button strip underneath the Keynote 
toolbar, allowing you to format selected text, paragraphs and lists on 
the fly.
Adding Slides
Sure, Keynote creates a single Title slide when you first create a project, but 
not many presentations are complete with just a single slide! To add more 
slides to your project, use one of these methods:
 
✦ Click the New button on the Keynote toolbar.
 
✦ Choose New Slide from the Slide menu.
 
✦ Press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Right-click (or Control-click) in the Slides list and choose New Slide from 
the menu.
Keynote adds the new slide to your Slides list and automatically switches to 
the new slide in the Layout pane.
 
Need a slide that’s very similar to an existing slide you’ve already designed? 
Right-click the existing slide and choose Duplicate to create a new slide just 
like it. (Consider it cloning without the science.)
To move slides to different positions in the Slides list (and therefore a dif-
ferent order in your Keynote slideshow), drag each slide thumbnail to the 
desired spot in the list.
Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
You’ve probably noticed that all the text within your first Title slide appears 
within boxes. Keynote uses boxes to manipulate text and graphics. You can 
resize a box (and its contents) by clicking and dragging one of the handles 
that appear around the edges of the box. (Your mouse cursor will change 
into a double-sided arrow when you’re “in the zone.”) The side-selection 
handles drag only that edge of the frame, whereas the corner-selection han-
dles resize both adjoining edges of the selection frame.

480
Working with Text and Graphics Boxes
 
To keep the proportions of the box constrained, hold down Shift while drag-
ging the corner handles.
Boxes make it easy to move text and graphics together (as a single unit) to 
another location within the Layout pane. Click in the center of the box and 
drag the box to the desired spot; Keynote displays alignment lines to help 
you align the box with other elements around it (or with regular divisions of 
the slide, like horizontal center). As you can see in Figure 3-3, I’m moving a 
box on the slide to a new location, and Keynote has supplied alignment lines 
to help me place it correctly.
 
To select text or graphics within a box, you should double-click the box.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Alignment 
lines are 
provided by 
Keynote as 
you move 
boxes.
 
 
If you’re resizing a photo in a box, don’t forget to hold down the Shift key 
as you drag the frame. Doing so specifies that Keynote should preserve the 
aspect ratio of the image so that the vertical and horizontal proportions 
remain fixed. You can also flip images horizontally or vertically from the 
Arrange menu.

Formatting Slide Text for the Perfect Look
Adding and Editing Slide Text
As with Pages and Numbers — which also use boxes for text layout — 
Keynote allows you to add or edit text with ease. For example, double-click 
in a box with the text Double-click to edit, and the placeholder text 
disappears, leaving the field ready to accept new text. Any new text you type 
appears at the blinking cursor within the box. 
To edit existing text in your Keynote document, click using the bar-shaped 
cursor to select just the right spot in the text, and drag the insertion cursor 
across the characters to highlight them. Type the replacement text, and 
Keynote obligingly replaces the text that was there with the text you type.
If you want to delete existing text, click and drag across the characters to 
highlight them; then press Delete. You can also delete an entire box and 
all its contents: Right-click (or Control-click) the offending box and choose 
Delete from the menu that appears.
When the contents of a box are just right and you’re finished entering or 
editing text, click anywhere outside the box to hide it from view. You can 
always click the text again to display the box later.
Formatting Slide Text for the Perfect Look
Keynote doesn’t restrict you to the default fonts for the theme you chose. 
It’s easy to format the text in your slides — you can choose a different font 
family, font color, text alignment, and text attributes such as bolding and 
italicizing on the fly, whenever you like.
Select the desired text by double-clicking a box and then dragging the text 
cursor to highlight the characters. Now apply your formatting using one of 
these two methods:
 
✦ The Format Bar: The font controls on the Format Bar work just as the 
controls on the toolbar do: Either click a font control to display a pop-up 
menu or click a button to immediately perform an action. Clicking the 
Font Size pop-up menu, for example, displays a range of sizes for the 
selected text — with a single click on the B (bold) button, you’ll add the 
bold attribute to the highlighted characters.
 
✦ The Format menu: The controls on the Format menu generally mirror 
those on the Format Bar. To change the alignment from the Format 
menu, click Format and hover the mouse cursor over the Text menu 
item. To change text attributes, click Format and hover your mouse over 
the Font menu.

482
Using Presenter’s Notes in Your Project
Using Presenter’s Notes in Your Project
As I mention earlier, you can type text notes in the Notes pane — I use 
them for displaying alternate topic points while presenting my slide show. 
However, you can also print the notes for a project along with the slides, so 
presenter’s notes are also great for including reminders and To Do points for 
your audience in handouts.
To type your notes, just click within the Notes pane; if it’s hidden, click 
View➪Show Presenter Notes. When you’re done adding notes, click in the 
Slide list or the Layout pane to return to editing mode.
 
To display your notes while practicing, use Keynote’s Rehearsal feature. 
Click Play and choose Rehearse Slideshow, and you can scroll through the 
notes while the slideshow runs. (More on slideshows in a second.)
Every Good Presentation Needs Media
Adding audio, photos, and movies to a slide is drag-and-drop easy in 
Keynote! Simply drag an image, audio, or movie file from a Finder window 
and place it at the spot you want within your document.
You can also use the Media Browser — click the Media button on the toolbar 
and click the Audio, Photos, or Movies button to select the desired type. 
Keynote displays the contents of your various media collections — like your 
iPhoto and iTunes libraries — or you can also navigate to the file’s location 
on your hard drive, or type in a filename in the Search box at the bottom of 
the browser. When you’ve found the file you want to add, drag it to the spot 
you want in the document. Figure 3-4 illustrates the Media Browser in action.
Adding a Background Shape
Text often stands out on a slide when it sits on top of a background shape. 
To add a shape (such as a rectangle or circle) as a background for your text, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the insertion cursor in the location you want.
 
2. Click the Shapes button on the Keynote toolbar and choose a shape.
 
 The shape appears in your document.

4. When the shape is properly positioned and sized, select it and choose 
Arrange➪Send to Back.

Creating Your Keynote Slideshow
The heart of a Keynote presentation is the slideshow that you build from the 
slides you’ve created. A Keynote slideshow is typically presented full screen, 
with slides appearing in linear order as they are sorted in the Slides list.
In its simplest form, you can always run a slideshow from a Keynote proj-
ect by clicking the Play button in the toolbar, or by choosing Play➪Play 
Slideshow from the menu. You can advance to the next slide by clicking your 
mouse, or by pressing the right bracket key, which looks like this: ].
Of course, other controls are available besides just the ones that advance to 
the next slide! Table 3-1 illustrates the key shortcuts you’ll use most often 
during a slideshow.

Keynote offers a number of settings that you can tweak to fine-tune your 
slideshow. To display these settings, choose Keynote➪Preferences and click 
the Slideshow button in the Preferences window.
 
If you have an iPhone or iPod touch handy and you’ve installed the Apple 
Keynote Remote application on your device, display the Preferences window 
and click the Remote button to link your iPhone or iPod touch to your 
MacBook and Keynote. Now you can use your handheld device as a remote 
and use it during your slideshow!
Printing Your Slides and Notes
Okay, I’ll be honest: I don’t always print handouts for every presentation I 
give, just because some of the slideshows I run are short introductions to 
hands-on demonstrations. However, if you’re presenting a lengthy slideshow 
with plenty of information that you’d like your audience to remember, noth-
ing beats handouts that include scaled-down images of your slides (and, 
optionally, your presenter’s notes).

Printing Your Slides and Notes
You can also use Keynote to create an electronic PDF-format document 
instead of a printed handout, which your audience members can download 
from your Web site. (For the lowdown on PDF printing, visit Chapter 4 in 
Book VIII.)
To print a hardcopy of your slides and notes, follow these steps:
 
1. Within Keynote, click File and choose Print.
 
 Keynote displays the Print sheet you see in Figure 3-5. (Note that some 
printer-specific features may be different on your screen.)
 
2. Click the desired format.
 
• To print each slide on a separate page at full size, click Individual 
Slides.
 
• To print each slide on a separate page with the presenter’s notes for 
that slide, click Slides with Notes.
 
• To print the contents of your Slides list in Outline view, click Outline.
 
• To print a handout with multiple slides per page (and, optionally, 
with presenter’s notes), click Handout. Click the Slides per Page 
pop-up menu to specify the number of slides that Keynote should 
print on each page.

Chapter 1: Getting on the Internet
In This Chapter
✓ Selecting an Internet service provider (ISP)
✓ Understanding how your MacBook gets on the Internet
✓ Setting up your Internet connection
I
’ll be honest — the Internet is a terribly complex monster of a network. 
If you tried to fathom all the data that’s exchanged on the Internet and 
everything that takes place when you check your e-mail for Aunty Joan’s 
fruitcake recipe, your brain would probably melt like a chocolate bar in the 
Sahara Desert. A shoebox full of arcane things is tucked under the Internet: 
communications protocols, routing addresses, packets, servers, and other 
hoo-hah that are beyond the grasp of just about everyone on the planet.
Luckily for regular folks like you and me, Mac OS X Snow Leopard closes the 
trapdoor on all these details, keeping them hidden (as they should be). You 
don’t have to worry about them, and the obscure information that you need 
to establish an Internet connection is kept to a minimum. In fact, the happi-
est computer owners I’ve met think that the Internet is a little blinking light 
on their DSL or cable modem: If the light blinks in the proper manner, all is 
well. (I don’t argue with them.)
In this chapter, I provide help and advice to those who are searching for an 
on-ramp to the Information Superhighway — and I lead you through the pro-
cedure of adding an Internet connection under Mac OS X. (In other words, 
you’ll get your light blinking properly.)
 
If you entered your Internet configuration information while you were in the 
Setup Assistant during the installation of Mac OS X, you can skip this chapter! 
The information contained herein is only for those who add or change their 
Internet connectivity after installing Mac OS X.
Shopping for an ISP
Before you can connect to the Internet, you must sign up for Internet access. 
If you already have an ISP (acronym-speak for an Internet service provider) or 
your company provides Internet access, smile quietly to yourself and skip 
to the next section. Otherwise, hang around while I discuss what to look for 
in an ISP and how to locate one in your local area.

490
Shopping for an ISP
If you’re unfamiliar with the term, an ISP is simply the company you contract 
with so that you can connect to the Internet. You may be contracting with a 
cable company, such as Comcast, Bright House, or Mediacom, or you may 
be using a service such as AOL, Juno, or Earthlink. All these are ISPs. 
ISPs are as thick as Louisiana mosquitoes these days, and often they’re 
judged solely by the amount that they charge for basic access. Cost defi-
nitely is a factor, but it’s not the only thing that should determine your 
choice in a service provider. Consider these guidelines when choosing or 
switching ISPs:
 
✦ Local calling rates: If you live in a rural area and you’re using a dial-up 
modem, check to make sure that all prospective ISPs offer local calling 
rates. Believe me, no matter how much fun and how useful the Internet 
is, it’s not worth hours of long-distance charges. (Oh, and don’t forget 
to make sure that your ISP has local access numbers in the cities that 
you visit regularly.) Since the current MacBook line doesn’t include an 
internal analog modem, you can always add an external USB modem for 
dial-up Internet access and faxing.
 
✦ Broadband service: Virtually all ISPs now offer digital subscriber line 
(DSL) or cable modem access. Collectively, these connections are called 
broadband because they offer the fastest method of transferring infor-
mation to and from the Internet. If you have a home business, a large 
family, or students — or you telecommute to your office — using broad-
band can make your life much simpler.
 
✦ Quality technical support: A 24-hour/7-day telephone support line is a 
godsend for the Internet novice — don’t settle for voice support during 
business hours. Forget e-mail-based support, too; your e-mail applica-
tion will be dead and gone if your Internet connection gives you prob-
lems. (Sound of your palm whacking your forehead.)
 
✦ Static IP addresses: A static IP address — the unique number that identi-
fies your computer on the Internet — allows you to set up a professional 
Web server or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server. Most ISPs charge an 
additional amount for a static IP address, so it’s not really a good idea 
for a typical Mac owner at home. Suffice it to say, however, that a busi-
ness or commercial organization running a Web server or FTP server 
will benefit from a static IP address.
 
✦ E-mail accounts: Investigate how many individual accounts you receive 
with various ISPs. Also, find out whether you can maintain them yourself 
through a Web site. If so, that’s a good sign. Additionally, if the prospec-
tive ISP provides a Web site where you can read and send e-mail mes-
sages, you can stay on top of your e-mail even while you’re on the road 
or vacationing halfway across the globe.

✦ Web space: If you want your ISP to host your Web site, this is a no-
brainer: The more space you get, the better. A minimum of 1GB is 
acceptable, but most ISPs provide 3GB or more these days. Also, beware 
of ISPs that charge you for your Web site if it receives a large amount of 
traffic: It can be expensive to host a popular Web site if you join one of 
these ISPs.
 
✦ Domain name service: Finally, the better class of ISP also offers a 
domain name service, which allows you to register something like your
namehere.com. For the most professional appearance, you can usually 
pay a yearly fee, and the ISP takes care of all the details in setting up 
your own .com or .org domain name.
Locating an ISP is easy in the modern, Internet-savvy world. In the order that 
you should try them, here are the tricks that I recommend for finding your 
local ISPs:
 
✦ Check with your cable or telephone companies. If you’re already sub-
scribing to cable service in your area, you’re likely to be a candidate 
for cable Internet access. Also, many local phone companies offer DSL 
access, but that access area is often limited to certain locations. Call 
the customer service numbers for these companies and check out what 
they offer — and don’t forget that a broadband cable or DSL connection 
is always more expensive than an old-fashioned, dial-up connection. 
(“Maude, did you see the Internet bill this month?”)
 
✦ Get recommendations from friends and neighbors. Folks love to give 
free advice. Ask them how much they’re paying, how reliable the con-
nection has been, and how well they rate the ISP’s technical support.
 
✦ Check your phone directory. Check the phone book for Internet 
service.
 
✦ Investigate ISP Web sites. If you have Internet access at work, a friend’s 
house, or your local public library, you can surf to The List (www.the
list.com), where you can search for ISPs within your area code and 
location.
Investigating Various Types of Connections
Consider the types of connections that are available under Snow Leopard to 
link your MacBook to an ISP (see the previous section for more about ISPs). 
You can choose from four pathways to digital freedom:
 
✦ A dial-up connection: Old-fashioned, yes. Slow as an arthritic burro, 
indeed. However, an analog (or telephone modem) connection is still a 
very viable method for reaching the Internet for most computer owners. 

492
Investigating Various Types of Connections
It’s the cheapest method available, and all you need for this type of 
connection is a standard telephone jack and a modem. Apple used to 
include a modem with every computer, but no longer . . . these days, 
you’ll have to buy an external USB modem to make the dial-up connec-
tion. (Apple makes one, or any Mac OS X–compatible USB modem will 
work fine.)
 
✦ A broadband connection: Be it through DSL (which uses a typical 
telephone line) or cable (which uses your cable TV wiring), broadband 
Internet access is many times faster than a dial-up connection. Plus, 
both these technologies are always on, meaning that your computer is 
automatically connected to the Internet when you turn it on and that 
connection stays active. With DSL or cable, no squeaky whine accom-
panies your modem while it makes a connection each time you want to 
check your movie listings Web site. Both DSL and cable require a special 
piece of hardware (commonly called a modem, but it really isn’t); this 
box is usually thrown in as part of your ISP charge. (Note that many cel-
lular providers offer cellular modems for Internet connectivity. Some of 
these modems use a USB port whereas others use the ExpressCard slot 
on a MacBook Pro.) DSL or cable broadband connections usually require 
a professional installation, too.
 
✦ A satellite connection: If you’re really out there — miles and miles away 
from any cable or DSL phone service — you can still get high-speed 
Internet access. The price for a satellite connection is usually much 
steeper than a standard DSL or cable connection, but it’s available any-
where you can plant your antenna dish with a clear view of the sky. Plus, 
a satellite connection is actually faster than other types of broadband 
access. Older satellite technologies actually required you to also use a 
dial-up connection — and the antenna could only receive, not send — 
but most ISPs that can handle satellite connections now offer satellite 
systems that both send and receive through the dish.
 
✦ A network connection: The last type of connection concerns those 
Macs that are part of a local area network (LAN) either at the office or 
in your home. If your MacBook is connected to a LAN that already has 
Internet access, you don’t need an ISP at all, and no other hardware is 
required: Simply contact your network administrator, buy that impor-
tant person a steak dinner, and ask to be connected to the Internet. On 
the other hand, if your network currently has no Internet access, you’re 
back to Square One: You’ll need one of the previous three types of 
connections.
 
After you connect one of your computers on your network to the Internet, 
you can use an Internet sharing device to allow all the computers to share 
that Internet connection. Book VII, Chapter 4 goes into all the details on 
sharing an Internet connection on a network.

Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Okay, so you sign up for Internet access, and your ISP sends you a sheet 
of paper covered with indecipherable stuff that looks like Egyptian hiero-
glyphics. Don’t worry; those are the settings that you need to connect to 
your ISP. After you get them in Mac OS X, you should be surfing the Web 
like an old pro.
 
Before you jump into this configuration, make sure that you’ve config-
ured the Internet settings within System Preferences, as I discuss in Book 
III, Chapter 3. That way, you’ll already have entered your default e-mail 
and Web settings. You’ll also need to be logged in using an Administrator 
account.
Using an internal or external modem
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using your 
MacBook’s external USB modem:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock and choose Network.
 
2. Select External modem from the list at the left side of the pane.
 
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
 
• If your ISP tells you to use PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol): Click the 
Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Using PPP. If your ISP pro-
vided you with DNS Server or Search Domain addresses, type them 
now in the corresponding boxes.
 
• If you’re using AOL: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose 
AOL Dialup. If AOL provided you with DNS Server or Search Domain 
addresses, click in the corresponding box and type them now.
 
• If you’re using a manual connection: Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up 
menu and choose Manually. Then click in the IP Address, DNS 
Servers, and Search Domains fields and enter the respective settings 
provided by your ISP.
 
4. If you need to enter PPP settings, click the Advanced button.
 
5. In their respective fields, enter the account name, password, tele-
phone number, and (optionally) the service provider name and an 
alternative telephone number provided by your ISP.
 
 I always like Mac OS X to connect automatically when I’m using a 
modem. I hate excess mouse movements, which usually lead to a bad 
case of Rodent Elbow. To automate your dial-up connection (allow-
ing Snow Leopard to call your ISP whenever your system needs the 
Internet), click the Connect Automatically When Needed check box to 
enable it.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences and save your changes.

494
Setting Up Your Internet Connection
Using Ethernet hardware
Follow these steps to set up your Internet connection if you’re using a net-
work, cable modem, or DSL connection:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock and choose Network.
 
2. Select Ethernet from the list on the left of the pane to display the set-
tings that you see in Figure 1-1.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The 
Network 
settings for 
an Ethernet 
Internet 
connection.
 
 
3. Enter the settings for the type of connection that your ISP provides:
 
• If your ISP tells you to use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
(DHCP): Choose Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu, 
and your ISP can automatically set up virtually all the TCP/IP settings 
for you! (No wonder DHCP is so popular these days.)
 
• If you won’t be using DHCP: Choose Manually from the Configure IPv4 
pop-up menu. Then enter the settings provided by your ISP in the IP 
Address, Subnet Mask, Router, and DNS Servers fields.
 
4. If your ISP uses PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet), click 
the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Create PPPoE Service.
 
5. Type an identifying name for the PPPoE service.
 
6. Click Done.

O
kay, how many of you can function without e-mail? Raise your hands. 
Anyone? Anyone at all?
I suppose that I can function without my Internet e-mail, but why should I? 
Mac OS X includes a very capable and reliable e-mail client, Apple Mail 
(affectionately called Mail by everyone but Bill Gates).
In this chapter, I discuss the features of Apple Mail and show you how 
everything hums at a perfect C pitch. However, you have to sing out, 
“You’ve got mail!” yourself. Personally, I think that’s a plus, but I show you 
how you can add any sound you like.
Know Thy Mail Window
To begin our epic e-mail journey, click the Mail icon in the Dock. Figure 2-1 
illustrates the Mail window. Besides the familiar toolbar, which naturally 
carries buttons specific to Mail, you find the following:
 
✦ Title bar: This heading at the top of the Mail window displays informa-
tion about the current folder — typically, how many messages it con-
tains, but other data can be included as well.
 
✦ Message list: This resizable scrolling list box contains all the messages for 
the folder that you’ve chosen. To resize the list larger or smaller, drag the 
handle on the bar that runs across the window. You can also resize the 
columns in the list by dragging the edges of the column heading buttons.
 
 To specify which columns appear in the message list, choose View➪
Columns. From the submenu that appears, you can toggle the display 
of specific columns. You can also sort the messages in the message 
list from the View menu; by default, messages are sorted by the Date 
Received. (Alternatively, use Lazy Mark’s method: Just click the column 
that you want to sort by.)

Mailboxes
Message list
Preview box
 
✦ Mailboxes: The column at the left of the main Mail window is the 
Mailboxes list. You can click any of the folders to switch the display 
in the message list. The Mailbox list can be hidden or shown from the 
View menu by clicking the Show Mailboxes item, or you can press the 
Ô+Shift+M keyboard shortcut to hide or show it. To widen or narrow the 
Mailboxes list, click the divider at the right side of the list. Your mouse 
cursor turns to a line with double arrows — and drag it in the desired 
direction.
 
✦ Preview box: This resizable scrolling text box displays the contents of 
the selected message, including both text and any graphics or attach-
ments that Mail recognizes.
Mail uses the following folders (some of which appear only at certain times):
 
✦ Inbox: Mail you’ve received already.
 
✦ Outbox: Messages that Mail is waiting to send.
 
✦ Drafts: Draft messages waiting to be completed.
 
✦ Sent: Mail you’ve sent already.

Setting Up Your Account
 
✦ Trash: Deleted mail. As with the Trash in the Dock, you can open this 
folder and retrieve items that you realize you still need. Alternatively, 
you can empty the contents of the Trash at any time by pressing the 
Ô+K shortcut or by choosing Mailbox➪Erase Deleted Messages.
 
✦ Junk: Junk mail. You can review these messages or retrieve anything 
you want to keep by choosing Message➪Move To. After you’re sure 
nothing of value is left, you can delete the remaining messages straight 
to the Trash. (Junk mail filtering must be enabled from the Junk Mail set-
tings in Preferences before you see this box.)
 
✦ RSS: Messages from an RSS news feed that you’ve subscribed to. You 
find out more on RSS later in this chapter.
 
✦ Notes: This folder displays notes that you’ve made. I discuss how to 
create a new note later in this chapter.
 
✦ To Do: Ah, don’t forget those all-important reminders about washing the 
car, paying taxes, and picking up dog food on the way home. The To Do 
folder displays your To Do items, which I cover later in the chapter.
 
You can add new personal folders to the Mailbox list to further organize 
your messages. Choose Mailbox➪New Mailbox and then type the name for 
your new folder in the Name box. Click OK to create the new personal folder.
Messages can be dragged from the message list and dropped into the 
desired folder in the Mailbox list to transfer them. Alternatively, you can 
move ’em from the Message list by selecting the messages that you want to 
move, choosing Message➪Move To, and then clicking the desired destina-
tion folder.
Also note that Spotlight has staked its claim with the Search box at the 
upper right in the Mail toolbar.
Setting Up Your Account
By default, Mail includes one (or more) of these accounts when you first 
run it:
 
✦ The account that you entered when you first installed Mac OS X: Go to 
Book II, Chapter 1 to read about the first use assistant that I discuss at 
the beginning of this book. If you entered the information for an e-mail 
account, it’s available.
 
✦ Your MobileMe account: If you registered for a MobileMe service 
account, it’s included.
 
✦ Upgraded accounts: If you upgraded an existing Mac OS system, your 
existing Mail accounts are added to the Accounts list in Mail.

500
Setting Up Your Account
Speaking of the Accounts list, choose Mail➪Preferences and click the 
Accounts button to display the Accounts pane that you see in Figure 2-2. 
From here, you can add an account, edit an existing account, or remove an 
account from Mail. Although most folks still have only one e-mail account, 
you can use a passel of them. For example, you might use one account for 
your personal e-mail and one account for your business communications. To 
switch accounts, just click the account that you want to use from this list to 
make it the active account.
Adding an account
To add a new account within Mail, choose File➪Add Account to open an 
Accounts assistant that leads you through the process. ’Nuff said.
However, I’m a manual kind of guy — at least, that’s what I’m told — so I 
should describe the process. For our demonstration, I’ll add a typical ISP 
POP account from the Preferences dialog, which displays the same Accounts 
assistant.
What’s a smart mailbox?
Remember the smart folders you can create in 
the Finder? Well, Apple Mail provides some-
thing similar for your e-mail messages: the 
smart mailbox. The contents of a smart mailbox 
are actually links to messages and To Do items 
in your Mail folders; these links match the 
search criteria you specify, such as messages 
from a specific address or those that contain 
attachments. Other criteria include the date an 
item is received, the subject of a message, the 
mailbox a message is stored in, and so on. You 
can use smart mailboxes to organize your mes-
sages and To Do items in different ways and 
identify those messages that require special 
(or immediate!) attention.
To set up a smart mailbox, choose Mailbox➪
New Smart Mailbox, or click the Add button 
(which carries a plus sign) at the lower-left 
corner of the Mail window and choose New 
Smart Mailbox from the drop-down menu. Type 
a name to identify the mailbox and then click 
the Contains pop-up menu to choose either 
messages or To Do items. Click the Match 
pop-up menu to specify whether the search 
should match any one or all of your criteria. 
Now you can click the pop-up menus to specify 
what the search should find. To add a new cri-
terion line, click the button with the plus sign. 
(To delete a criterion line that Should Not Be, 
click the button with the minus sign next to the 
offending line.) Note that you can also include 
messages from Mail’s Trash and Sent fold-
ers. When you’re ready, click OK, and the new 
smart mailbox appears in the Mailboxes list. It 
has a cool folder icon with a gear symbol, much 
like the gear symbol sported by smart folders in 
a Finder window.
If you’ve set up your smart folder, it automati-
cally maintains itself when you receive, send, 
and delete messages and To Do items, always 
showing whatever matches your criteria. 
Here’s a mind-boggler: Imagine what Ben 
Franklin could’ve done if he’d been able to use 
smart folders!

list, where 
all is made 
clear (about 
your e-mail 
accounts).
 
Open the Preferences dialog by clicking Mail and choosing Preferences; then 
click the Accounts button on the Preferences toolbar. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add button at the bottom-left corner of the window, which 
carries a plus sign.
 
2. On the General Information pane, type your full name in the Full 
Name field — or, if this is to be an anonymous account, enter what-
ever you like as your identity — and then press Tab.
 
 
Messages that you send appear with this name in the From field in the 
recipient’s e-mail application.
 
3. Type the e-mail address assigned to you by your ISP.
 
4. In the Password field, type the password supplied by your ISP for 
login to your e-mail account.
 
5. Click Continue.
 
 
Here’s a great feature: If Mail recognizes the type of account you’re 
using, the assistant may offer to automatically complete all the required 
settings for you! (If the account is recognized, the Continue button 
switches to a Create button. Smile proudly and click Create, and you’re 
done.) If your account isn’t recognized by Mail, it’s no big deal — just 
continue with Step 6.

502
Setting Up Your Account
 
6. Click the Account Type pop-up menu and choose the protocol type to 
use for the account.
 
 You can select an Apple MobileMe account, a Post Office Protocol 
(POP) account, a Microsoft Exchange 2007 account, an Internet Message 
Access Protocol (IMAP) account, or a standard Microsoft Exchange 
IMAP account. If you’re adding an account from an Internet service 
provider (ISP), refer to the set-up information that you received to deter-
mine which is right. Most ISP accounts are POP accounts.
 
 
When you select an Account Type, the fields may change on the Accounts 
assistant, but they’ll still follow the same general order I give in this POP 
account demonstration. (In fact, there are fewer fields to fill out for IMAP 
accounts!) Keep the account information provided by your ISP handy 
because that data should include everything covered in the assistant.
 
7. In the Description field, name the account to identify it within Mail 
and then press Tab to move to the next field.
 
 For example, Work and Home ISP are good choices.
 
8. In the Incoming Mail Server text box, type the incoming mail server 
address supplied by your ISP.
 
 If your ISP requires a login for security, you need to enter your server 
username and password.
 
9. Click Continue.
 
10. On the Incoming Mail Security sheet, click the Authentication pop-up 
menu and choose the authentication scheme used by your incoming 
mail server.
 
 Unless you’re told differently by your ISP, the default choice — 
Password — is very likely correct already.
 
11. Click Continue.
 
12. On the Outgoing Mail Server sheet, type a description for the server 
and press Tab.
 
 I typically enter the ISP name.
 
13. In the Outgoing Mail Server text box, type the outgoing mail server 
address supplied by your ISP.
 
14. If your ISP requires your e-mail application to authenticate the connec-
tion, select the Use Authentication check box and type the username 
and password supplied by your ISP into the corresponding fields.
 
15. Click Continue on the Account Summary sheet.
 
16. Click Done on the Conclusion sheet.
 
 You’re done! The new account appears in the Accounts list.
You can specify advanced settings for an account. I cover those in the sec-
tion “Fine-Tuning Your Post Office,” later in this chapter.

Editing an existing account
Need to make changes to an existing account? Choose Mail➪Preferences and 
click the account that you want to change. Mail displays the same settings 
that I explain in the preceding section.
Deleting an account
If you change ISPs or you decide to drop an e-mail account, you can remove 
it from your Accounts list. Otherwise, Mail can annoy you with error mes-
sages when it can no longer connect to the server for that account. Display 
the Mail Preferences dialog, select the account that you want to delete, and 
then click the Remove button (which is graced by a minus sign).
Naturally, Mail requests confirmation before deleting the folders associated 
with that account. Click OK to verify the deletion or click the Cancel button 
to prevent accidental catastrophe.
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
The heart and soul of Mail — well, the heart, anyway — is receiving and 
reading stuff from your friends and family. (Later in this chapter, I show you 
how to avoid the stuff you get promising free prizes, low mortgage rates, 
and improved . . . um, performance. This is a family-oriented book, so that’s 
enough of that.)
After you set up an account (or select an account from the Accounts list), 
it’s time to check for mail. Use any of these methods to check for new mail:
 
✦ Click the Get Mail button on the toolbar.
 
✦ Right-click the Mail icon in the Dock and choose Get New Mail from 
the menu that appears.
 
✦ Choose Mailbox➪Get All New Mail or press Ô+Shift+N.
 
✦ Choose Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choose the specific account 
to check from the submenu.
 
 
This is a great way to check for new mail in another account without 
going through the trouble of making it active in the Preferences window.
Mail can also check for new messages automatically; you can find more on 
this topic in the “Checking Mail automatically” section, later in this chapter.
If you do have new mail in the active account, it appears in the Message list. 
As you can see in Figure 2-3, new unread messages appear marked with a 
snazzy blue dot in the first column. The number of unread messages is dis-
played next to the Inbox folder icon in the Mailboxes list.

504

Figure 2-3:

Mail also displays the number of new messages that you’ve received on its 
Dock icon. If you’ve hidden the Mail window or sent it to the Dock, you can 
perform a quick visual check for new mail just by glancing at the Dock.
Reading and deleting your messages
To read any message in the message list, you can either click the desired 
entry (which displays the contents of the message in the preview pane) or 
you can double-click the entry to open the message in a separate message 
window, complete with its own toolbar controls.
 
To quickly scan your mail, click the first message that you want to view in 
the list and then press the down-arrow key when you’re ready to move to 
the next message. Mail displays the content of each message in the preview 
pane. To display the previous message in the list, press the up-arrow key.
Mail also allows you to read your messages grouped within threads. A thread 
contains an original message and all related replies, which makes it easy 
to follow the flow of an e-mail discussion (without bouncing around within 
your Inbox, searching for the next message in the conversation). Choose 
View➪Organize by Thread, and the replies in the current folder are all 
grouped under the original messages and sorted by date. To expand a thread, 
click the original message to select it; then press the right-arrow key (or 
choose View➪Expand All Threads). To collapse a thread, select the original 
message and press the left-arrow key (or choose View➪Collapse All Threads).

Hey, why not let Mail read you your mail? (That is, if you can drive and listen 
to your MacBook speak at the same time!) Simply select one message or a 
group of messages and then choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking. Wowzers!
To delete a message from the message list, click the desired entry to select 
it and then click the Delete button on the toolbar (or press the Del key). To 
delete a message from within a message window, click the Delete button on 
the toolbar.
Replying to mail
What? Aunt Harriet sent you a message because she’s forgotten where she 
parked her car last night? If you happen to know where her priceless ’78 
Pinto is, you can reply to her and save her the trouble of retracing her steps.
 
If Aunt Harriet isn’t in your Address Book yet, this is a good time to add her. 
With the message entry selected in the list, choose Message➪Add Sender 
to Address Book or just press the convenient Ô+Shift+Y keyboard shortcut. 
The person’s name and e-mail address are added automatically to your 
Address Book. To add more information in the Address Book, however, you 
have to open that application separately. (Read through Book II, Chapter 6 
for the skinny on the Address Book.)
To reply to a message in Mail, follow these steps:
 
1. To respond to a message from the message list, click the desired 
message entry and then click the Reply button on the toolbar.
 
 To respond to a message that you’ve opened in a message window, click 
the Reply button on the toolbar for the message window.
 
 If a message was addressed not just to you but also to a number of differ-
ent people, you can send your reply to all of them. Instead of clicking the 
Reply button, click the Reply All button on the Mail window toolbar. (This 
is a great way to quickly facilitate a festive gathering, if you get my drift.)
 
 You can also add carbon copies of your message to other new recipi-
ents, expanding the party exponentially; more on carbon copies later, in 
the section “Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail.”
 
 Mail opens the Reply window that you see in Figure 2-4. Note that the 
address has been added automatically and that the default Subject is 
Re: <the original subject>. Mail automatically adds a separator 
line in the message body field that reads On <date>, at <time>, 
<addressee> wrote:, followed by the text of the original message; 
this is done so that the addressee can remember what the heck he or 
she wrote in the first place to get you so happy/sad/angry/indifferent. 
The original text is indented and prefaced by a vertical line to set it 
apart. If you like, you can click in the Subject line and change the default 
subject line; otherwise, the cursor is already sitting on the first line of 
the text box, so you can simply start typing your reply.

506
Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
 
 
To choose the text from the original message that you want to include in 
a reply, select the desired text in the original message before you click 
the Reply button.
 
2. After you complete typing your reply, you can select text in the mes-
sage body and apply different fonts or formats.
 
 To change your reply’s formatting, click the Fonts button on the mes-
sage window toolbar. From the window that appears, you can choose 
the font family, the type size, and formatting (such as italic or bold) for 
the selected text. Click the Close button on the Fonts window to con-
tinue. (If you like menus, you can also choose Format from the menu and 
make changes from there.)
 
 To apply color to the selected text, click the Colors button on the mes-
sage window toolbar and then click anywhere in the color wheel that 
appears to select that color. You can also vary the hue by moving the 
slider bar at the right of the Colors window. After you find the color 
that expresses your inner passion, click the Close button on the Colors 
window to continue.
 
 
To create a bulleted list in your reply, click Format➪Lists and choose 
either a bulleted or a numbered list. Mail thoughtfully prepares your 
first bullet item for you. Press Return to add another bullet item. Click 
outside the bullet formatting to complete the list.
 
 Care to chat directly with the recipients of your message? Just click 
the Chat button on the toolbar, and Mail automatically opens iChat and 
attempts to connect! (Note that this will work only with the recipients 
who have an instant messaging address in their Address Book card.) 
This Chat feature also appears on the New Message window toolbar, 
which I discuss in a page or two.
 
3. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar.
 
 Mail displays a familiar Open dialog. Navigate to the to-be-attached file, 
select it, and click the Open button to add it to the message. (More on 
attachments in the “Attachments on Parade” section, later in this chap-
ter.) If the recipient is running Windows, make sure the Send Windows-
Friendly Attachments check box is enabled — this results in a slightly

message to its rightful destination. By default, 
all you’ll see is the filtered heading, which 
includes only the From, Date, To, and Subject 
fields. This is great unless for some reason 
you need to display the entire message header 
in all its arcane madness. If you do, press 
Ô+Shift+H. You can toggle back to the filtered 
heading by pressing the same shortcut.

larger e-mail message size but helps ensure that PC e-mail programs, 
such as Outlook and Outlook Express, can correctly open your 
attachments.
 
 
Because most folks end up sending photos through e-mail, Apple 
includes a Photo Browser button on the toolbar. Click this button on the 
Reply or New Message window toolbars and you can choose a photo 
from your iPhoto library to insert directly into your message. Heck, 
you can even take a quick candid shot using Photo Booth and your 
MacBook’s built-in iSight camera.
 
4. When you’re ready to send your reply, you have two options. You can 
click the Send button to immediately add the message to your Outbox 
folder or you can click the Save as Draft button to store it in your 
Drafts folder for later editing.
 
 After a message is moved to the Outbox folder, it’s sent either immedi-
ately or at the next connection time that you specify in Mail Preferences 
(more on this in the section “Checking Mail automatically,” later in the 
chapter). However, saving the message to your Drafts folder doesn’t 
send it. Read the following section for the skinny on how to send a mes-
sage stored in your Drafts folder.

an incoming 
e-mail 
message.

Receiving and Reading E-Mail Wisdom
When you reply to a message, you can also forward your reply to another 
person (instead of the original sender). The new addressee receives a mes-
sage containing both the text of the original message that you received and 
your reply. To forward a message, click the Forward button on the Mail tool-
bar instead of Reply or Reply to All.
 
If you don’t want to include the text of the original message in a reply, 
choose Mail➪Preferences. Click the Composing button and disable the 
Quote the Text of the Original Message check box.
By default, Mail checks your spelling while you type and also underlines any 
words that it doesn’t recognize. (Very Microsoftian.) I personally like this 
feature, but if you find it irritating, you can turn it off or set Mail to check 
the spelling just once (when you click Send). Just choose Mail➪Preferences, 
click Composing, and click the Check Spelling as I Type pop-up menu to 
choose the desired option.
Hey, what does MIME mean?
First, a note of explanation about Internet e-mail. 
(Don’t worry about notes; you won’t be tested 
on this stuff.) Decades back, Internet e-mail 
messages were pure text, composed only of 
ASCII characters — that means no fancy fonts, 
colors, stationery, or text formatting. However, 
as more and more folks started using e-mail, the 
clarion call rang forth across the land for more 
attractive messages (as well as attachments, 
which I cover in the section “Attachments on 
Parade”). Therefore, the MIME encoding stan-
dard was developed. In case you’re interested, 
MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail 
Extensions — a rather cool (and surprisingly 
understandable) acronym.
Originally, virtually all e-mail programs rec-
ognized MIME, but then the Tower of Babel 
principle kicked in, and now there are actually 
multiple versions of MIME. Apple Mail uses the 
most common variant of MIME, so most folks 
who receive your e-mail can see them in all 
their glory (even under Windows).
However, if one of your addressees complains 
that he got a message containing unrecogniz-
able gobbledygook and a heading that mentions 
MIME, he’s using an e-mail client application 
that either doesn’t support MIME or supports a 
different version. (Of course, that person could 
have unknowingly turned off MIME support.) 
You have two possible solutions: You can ask 
the addressee to double-check whether MIME 
is enabled on his end in the e-mail application 
or you can disable MIME when sending a mes-
sage to that particular person. When you’re 
composing an original message or a reply, you 
can use pure text by choosing Format➪Make 
Plain Text. (Naturally, this prevents you from 
doing anything fancy, and files that you attach 
to a plain-text message might not be delivered 
correctly.)

Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
To compose and send a new message to someone, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the New Message button on the Mail toolbar or choose File➪New 
Message (or avail yourself of the handy Ô+N keyboard shortcut).
 
 Mail opens the New Message window that you see in Figure 2-5.
 
2. Enter the recipient’s (To) address by
 
• Typing it in directly
 
• Pasting it in after copying it to the Clipboard
 
• Dragging an e-mail address from your Address Book
 
 or
 
• (My favorite) Clicking the Address toolbar button, which shows 
you the scaled-down version of the Address Book (the Addresses 
window) that you see in Figure 2-6.
 
Figure 2-5:

be filled.
 

510
Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
 
Figure 2-6: 
Select 
an e-mail 
address 
from your 
Address 
Book.
 
 
 From the Addresses window, click the address that you want to use and 
then click the To button. To pick multiple recipients, hold down the Ô 
key while you click the multiple addresses. Click the Close button on the 
Addresses window to close it; then, press Tab.
 
 
If you have a huge number of entries in your Address Book, use the 
Search field on the Addresses window toolbar, which operates just like 
the Finder window Search box.
 
3. When Mail highlights the Cc field (the spot where you can send 
optional carbon copies of the message to additional recipients), you 
can type the addresses directly, use the contents of the Clipboard, or 
display the Addresses window.
 
 If you use the Addresses window, select the addresses that you want 
to use and click the Cc button. Then click the Close button on the 
Addresses window and press Tab.
 
 
Looking for the Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc) field? To display it, choose 
View➪Bcc Address Field. (A blind carbon copy is a message sent to mul-
tiple recipients, just like a regular carbon copy, but the recipients aren’t 
listed when the message is displayed — that way, the other recipients 
don’t know who else got a copy of the message.) You can also click the 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
511
Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
small Field Display pop-up menu at the left side of the Subject field to 
toggle the display of the Bcc Address Field. Oh, and there’s also a Bcc 
button on the Addresses window — go figure.
 
4. In the Subject field, enter the subject of the message and then 
press Tab.
 
 Your text cursor now rests in the first line of the message text box — 
type, my friend, type like the wind! It’s considered good form to keep 
this line short and relatively to the point.
 
5. Click the Show Stationery button on the toolbar to display the 
Stationery strip above the message text box (as shown in Figure 2-7), 
where you can choose one of many backgrounds that Apple supplies.
 
Figure 2-7: 
Adding

impact to 
my e-mail 
message

background.
 
 
 Stationery isn’t required, but it really packs a visual wallop! Double-click 
a thumbnail in the strip to add it to your message; to display a different 
category of stationery, such as a Greeting or Invitation, click the cat-
egory buttons on the left side of the Stationery strip.
 
 
This one will really knock your socks off: If you choose a Photo stationery 
background for your new message, you can even drag an image from the 
Photo Browser, the iPhoto window, or a Finder window to fill the “place-
holder” images on the background. (Which, when you think about it, kind 
of makes sense . . . after all, why send an e-mail from sunny Italy that has 
stock photos of a strange couple at the top? Add your own travel shots 
instead!) Figure 2-7 illustrates a Photo stationery background.

512
Raise the Little Flag: Sending E-Mail
 
 
Not all e-mail applications on other computers correctly display a mes-
sage with a stationery background. For the whole scoop, see the “Hey, 
what does MIME mean?” sidebar, earlier in this chapter. Also, remember 
that a message with a stationery background is going to be much larger 
than a simple text message, especially if it contains a number of photos. 
(And, as you guessed, that also means that it takes longer to send and 
receive, which is very important for those using a dial-up analog modem 
connection.) Many Internet service providers limit the size of messages 
and attachments, so adding a stationery background may render a mes-
sage undeliverable to some recipients. 
 
6. After you type your message, select any of the text that you’ve entered 
and use the toolbar features I describe in the section “Replying to 
mail,” earlier in this chapter, to apply different fonts or formatting.
 
 Click the Fonts button in the message window toolbar to open a window 
of formatting choices. (Click its Close button to continue.) If you like 
menus, you can also click Format and make changes from there.
 
7. Add color to any selected text, if you like.
 
 Just click the Colors button in the message window toolbar and make 
choices in the Snow Leopard Color Picker that appears; when the hue is 
perfect, click the Close button on the Color Picker to continue.
 
8. To add an attachment, click the Attach button on the toolbar, navigate 
to the to-be-attached file in the dialog that appears, select the file, and 
then click Open to add it to the message.
 
 Remember, if you’d like to include photos in your message, just click the 
Photo Browser toolbar button to select images from your iPhoto library, 
or take a photo with Photo Booth.
 
9. When your new message is ready to post, either click the Send button 
to immediately add the message to your Out folder or click the Save 
as Draft button to store it in your Drafts folder (without actually send-
ing it).
To send a message held in your Drafts folder, click the Drafts folder in the 
Drawer to display all draft messages. Double-click the message that you 
want to send, which displays the message window (you can make edits at 
this point, if you like) and then click the Send button on the message window 
toolbar.
 
If you don’t have access to an Internet connection at the moment, Mail 
allows you to work offline. This way, you can read your unread messages 
and compose new ones on the road to send later. After you regain your 
Internet connection, you might need to choose Mailbox➪Go Online (depend-
ing on the connection type).

What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
What? You Get Junk Mail, Too?
Spam — it’s the Crawling Crud of the Internet, and I hereby send out a 
lifetime of bad karma to those who spew it. However, chucking the First 
Amendment is not an option, so I guess we’ll always have junk mail. (Come 
to think of it, my paper mailbox is just as full of the stuff.)
Thankfully, Apple Mail has a net that you can cast to collect junk mail before 
you have to read it. The two methods of handling junk mail are
 
✦ Manually: You can mark any message in the message list as Junk Mail. 
Select the unwanted flotsam in the message list and then click the Junk 
button on the Mail window toolbar, which marks the message, as shown 
in Figure 2-8. (Ocean-front property in Kansas . . . yeah, right.) If a mes-
sage is mistakenly marked as junk but you actually want it, display the 
message in the preview box and then click the Not Junk button at the 
top of the preview box.
 
✦ Automatically: Apple Mail has a sophisticated Junk Mail filter that you 
actually train to better recognize what’s junk. (Keep reading to discover 
how.) After you train Mail to recognize spam with a high degree of accu-
racy, turn it to full Automatic mode, and it moves all those worthless 
messages to your Junk folder.
 
Figure 2-8: 
“Be gone, 
sludge 
demons of 
Junk Mail!”
 

514
Attachments on Parade
You customize and train the Junk Mail filter from the Preferences dialog 
(available from your trusty Mail menu); click Junk Mail to show the settings. 
I recommend that you first try Mail in Training mode, using the Mark as Junk 
Mail, But Leave It in My Inbox option. Junk Mail then takes its best shot at 
determining what’s junk. When you receive more mail and mark more mes-
sages as junk (or mark them as not junk), you’re actually teaching the Junk 
Mail feature how to winnow the wheat from the chaff. In Training mode, junk 
messages aren’t actually moved anywhere — they’re just marked with a par-
ticularly fitting, grungy brown color.
After you’re satisfied that the Junk Mail filter is catching just about every-
thing that it can, display the Mail preferences again and choose the Move It 
to the Junk Mailbox option. Mail creates a Junk folder and prompts you for 
permission to move all junk messages to this folder. After you review every-
thing in the Junk folder, you can delete what it contains and send it to the 
Trash folder. To save a message from junkdom, click the Not Junk button in 
the preview window and then drag the message from the Junk folder mes-
sage list to the desired folder in the Drawer.
Finally, you can create a complete set of custom rules for your Junk Mail fil-
tering by clicking Perform Custom Actions — the Advanced button displays 
your Junk Mail rule set and allows you to edit your rules. I explain rules in 
more depth at the end of this chapter.
If you don’t receive a lot of spam — or you want to be absolutely sure that 
nothing gets labeled as junk until you review it — click the Enable Junk Mail 
Filtering check box to disable it. (And good luck.)
 
By default, Mail exempts certain messages from Junk Mail status based on 
three criteria: if the sender is in your Address Book, if you’ve sent the sender 
a message in the past, or if the message is addressed to you with your full 
name. To tighten up your Junk Mail filtering to the max, you might want to 
disable these check boxes as well.
To reset the Junk Mail filter and erase any training that you’ve done, visit the 
Junk Mail settings in Preferences again and click Reset. Then click the Yes 
button to confirm your choice.
Attachments on Parade
Attachments are a fun way to transfer files through e-mail. However, it’s 
imperative that you remember these three very important caveats:
 
✦ Attachments can contain viruses. Even a message attachment that 
was actually sent by your best friend can contain a virus or malevolent 
macro — either because your friend unwittingly passed one along or 

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
515
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
because the virus actually took control of your friend’s e-mail applica-
tion and replicated itself automatically. (Ugh.)
 
✦ Corpulent attachments don’t make it. Most corporate and ISP mail serv-
ers have a 2–4MB limit for the total size of a message, and the attach-
ments (and any Photo stationery background you might have added) 
count toward that final message size. Therefore, I recommend sending a 
file as an attachment only if it’s less than 2MB (or perhaps 3MB) in size. 
If the recipient’s e-mail server sends you an automated message saying 
that the message was refused because it was too big, this is the problem.
 
✦ Not all e-mail applications and firewalls accept attachments. Not all 
e-mail programs support attachments in the same way, and others are 
simply set for pure text messages. Some corporate firewalls even reject 
messages with attachments. If the message recipient gets the message 
text but not the attachment, these are the likely reasons.
With all that said, it’s back to attachments as a beneficial feature. Follow 
these steps to save an attachment that you receive:
 
1. Click the message with an attachment in your message list.
 
 
Having trouble determining which messages have attachments? Choose 
View➪Columns and then click the Attachments item from the submenu 
that appears to toggle it on. Now messages with attachments appear 
with a tiny paper-clip icon in the entry.
 
 If Mail recognizes the attachment format, it displays or plays the attach-
ment in the body of the message; if not, the attachment is displayed as a 
file icon.
 
2. To open an attachment that’s displayed as a file icon, click the file 
icon and then choose Open Attachment from the pop-up menu that 
appears.
 
 If you know what application should be used to open the attachment, 
click the Open With button and choose the correct application from the 
submenu that appears.
 
3. To save an attachment, right-click the attachment (however it appears 
in the message) and then choose Save Attachment from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 In the Save dialog that appears, navigate to the location where you want 
to save the file and then click Save.
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
As is all other Apple software, Mail is easily customized to your liking. In this 
section, I discuss some of the preferences that you might want to change.

516
Fine-Tuning Your Post Office
Adding sound
To choose a sound that plays whenever you receive new mail, choose 
Mail➪Preferences and click the General button. Either click the New 
Messages Sound pop-up menu and choose one of the sounds that Apple 
provides or choose Add/Remove from the pop-up menu to choose a sound 
file from the Sounds folder (which, in turn, is located within your Library 
folder). Choose None from the pop-up menu to disable the new mail sound 
altogether.
Checking Mail automatically
By default, Mail automatically checks for new mail (and sends any mail in 
your Out folder) every five minutes. To change this delay period, display the 
General pane in the Preferences dialog, choose the Check for New Messages 
pop-up menu, and then choose one of the time periods. To disable automatic 
mail checking, choose Manually; you can click the Get Mail toolbar button to 
manually check your mail any time you like. (For example, those folks using 
dial-up analog modem connections may not fancy Mail taking control of the 
telephone line every 5 minutes.)
Automating junk mail and message deletion
If you like, Mail can be set to automatically delete sent mail and Junk mes-
sages (as well as permanently erase messages that you relegate to the 
Trash). To configure these settings, display the Accounts pane in the 
Preferences window, click the desired account, and then click the Mailboxes 
Behaviors tab.
To delete Sent messages automatically, click the Delete Sent Messages When 
pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. You can choose to 
delete mail after a day, a week, a month, or immediately upon quitting Mail. 
Alternatively, you can leave this field set to Never, and Mail never automati-
cally deletes any messages from the Sent folder.
To delete Junk messages automatically, click the Delete Junk Messages 
When pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action. (They’re the 
same as the options available for Sent mail.)
To delete messages from the Trash, click the Permanently Erase Deleted 
Messages When pop-up menu and choose the delay period or action — 
again, the choices are the same as those for Sent messages.
Adding signatures
To add a block of text or a graphic to the bottom of your messages as your 
personal signature, follow these steps:

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
517
Automating Your Mail with Rules
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and click the Signatures button.
 
2. From the Signatures pane that appears, click the Add Signature button 
(which carries a plus sign).
 
3. Click the signature name to open an edit box and then type an identi-
fying name.
 
 Press Return to save the new name.
 
4. Click inside the text entry box at the right to move the cursor.
 
5. Type the signature itself in the text entry box or copy the signature to 
the Clipboard and paste it into the text entry box.
 
 
Because downloading a graphic in a signature takes longer — and 
because some folks still use plain-text e-mail — avoid the temptation to 
include graphics in your signature.
 
6. If you have multiple signatures, click the Choose Signature pop-up 
menu to choose which one you want to use or to use them all ran-
domly or in sequence.
If you prefer the signature to appear above the quoted text in a reply, select 
the Place Signature above Quoted Text check box.
Changing the status of an account
Sometimes you can’t reach one of your accounts. For example, maybe you’re 
on the road with your laptop and you can’t access your office network. 
Apple Mail allows you to enable and disable specific accounts without the 
hassle of deleting an account and then having to add it again.
To disable or enable an account, open the Preferences dialog, click the 
Accounts button, click the desired account, click the Advanced tab, and then 
select (or deselect) the Enable This Account check box as necessary.
 
If you disable an account, you should also deselect the Include When 
Automatically Checking for New Mail check box to make sure that Mail 
doesn’t display an error message. You can always check any account for 
new mail by choosing Mailbox➪Get New Mail and then choosing the desired 
account name from the submenu.
Automating Your Mail with Rules
Before I leave the beautiful shores of Mail Island, I’d be remiss if I didn’t dis-
cuss one of its most powerful features: the ability to create rules, which are 
automated actions that Mail can take. With rules, you can specify criteria 
that can perform actions such as

518
Automating Your Mail with Rules
 
✦ Transferring messages from one folder to another
 
✦ Forwarding messages to another address
 
✦ Highlighting or deleting messages
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences and then click the Rules button on the 
toolbar.
 
 Mail displays the Rules pane.
 
2. To duplicate an existing rule, highlight it in the list and then click the 
Duplicate button. (For this demonstration, however, create a rule from 
scratch by clicking the Add Rule button.)
 
3. In the Description field, type a descriptive name for the new rule and 
then press Tab to move to the next field.
 
4. Click the If pop-up menu to specify whether the rule is triggered if any 
of the conditions are met or if all conditions must be met.
 
5. Because each rule requires at least one condition, click the target 
pop-up menus to set the target for the condition.
 
 These include whom the message is from or to, which account received 
the message, whether the message is marked as junk, and whether the 
message contains certain content. Select the target for the condition.
 
6. Click the Criteria pop-up menu to choose the rule’s criteria.
 
 
The contents of this pop-up menu change depending on the condi-
tion’s target. For example, if you choose From as the target, the criteria 
include Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, and so forth.
 
7. Click in the expression box and type the text to use for the condition.
 
 For example, a completed condition might read
Subject Contains Ocean-Front
 
 This particular condition is true if I get an e-mail message with a subject 
that contains the string Ocean-Front.
 
8. Add more conditions by clicking the plus sign button at the right of 
the first condition.
 
 
To remove any condition from this rule, click the minus sign button next 
to it. Remember, however, that every rule needs at least one condition.
 
9. To specify what action is taken after the condition (or conditions) is 
met, click the first Perform the Following Actions pop-up menu to see 
the action that this rule should perform. Then click the second pop-up 
menu and select the action for the rule.

Book VI
Chapter 2
Using Apple Mail
519
Automating Your Mail with Rules
 
 Choices include transferring a message from one folder to another, 
playing a sound, automatically forwarding the message, deleting it, and 
marking it as read.
 
 Each rule requires at least one action.
 
10. Depending on the action that you select, specify one or more criteria 
for the action.
 
 For instance, if I select Set Color as my action, I must then choose 
whether to color the text or the background as well as what color to use.
 
 
As with the plus button next to the conditions, you can also click the 
plus button next to the first action to perform more than one action. To 
remove an action, click the minus button next to it.
 
11. When the rule is complete, click OK to save it.
 
 Here’s an example of a complex rule:
 
 If the message was sent by someone in my Address Book and the Subject 
field contains the text FORWARD ME, forward the message to the e-mail 
address fuadramses@me.com.
This is a good example of an automated forwarding rule. With this rule in 
place and Mail running on Mac OS X, any of my friends, family, or co-workers 
can forward urgent e-mail to my MobileMe account while I’m on vacation. To 
trigger the rule, all the sender has to do is include the words FORWARD ME 
in the message subject. And if the sender isn’t in my Address Book, the rule 
doesn’t trigger, and I can read the message when I get home. Mondo sassy.
Each rule in the Rules dialog can be enabled or disabled by toggling the 
Active check box next to the rule. You can also edit a rule by selecting it in 
the Rules pane and then clicking the Edit button. To delete a rule completely 
from the list, select it and then click the Remove button; Mail prompts you 
for confirmation before the deed is done.
If you decide to create a custom Junk mail processing rule, the process is the 
same, but you get to it from a different place. Click the Junk Mail button on 
the Preferences dialog toolbar and click the Perform Custom Actions radio 
button to select it. You see that the Advanced button is now enabled — click 
it and you can set up the custom Junk mail rules that handle stuff from any 
conceivable junk mail source!

T
hroughout humankind’s history, our drive has been toward communica-
tion — from the earliest cave paintings, through written language, to 
the telegraph, telephone, and cell phone all-in-one PDA that the guy in the 
SUV in front of you is using . . . and he’s arguing with someone and he’s not 
paying attention and . . . (whump).
So much for the scholarly introduction — anyway, forget that silly cellular 
phone and your complicated calling plan! As long as you have Mac OS X and 
an Internet connection, you can instantly chat with your friends and family 
whether they’re across the aisle in another cube or halfway across the 
world. And, by golly, if your friends have an iSight camera, Web camera, or 
digital video (DV) camcorder connected to their computer, you’ll see each 
other in glorious, full-color video! This modern marvel is iChat, and it fulfills 
the decades-old promise of the video telephone quite well, thank you.
In this chapter, I show you how to gab with the following folks:
 
✦ Others who use iChat (either on your local network or on the Internet)
 
✦ Anyone who uses AIM — that’s short for America Online (AOL) Instant 
Messaging — MobileMe, Jabber, or Google Talk
 
✦ Folks who participate in AOL chat rooms

522
Configuring iChat
Configuring iChat
When you first run iChat (by clicking the iChat icon in the Dock), you’re 
prompted to create an iChat account. Type the first name (your name) that 
you want to use in the First Name field, press Tab, and then type the sur-
name that you want to use. (Yes, you can even use Bullwinkle Moose — just 
leave out the middle initial J.)
 
By default, iChat uses the MobileMe account that you set up when you 
run Mac OS X for the first time. In this case, your MobileMe account name 
and password are entered automatically for you, and you’re good to go. 
However, if you’re already using AIM, Jabber, or Google Talk and you want 
to use your existing account, click the Account Type pop-up menu and 
choose the correct type; then enter your existing account name and pass-
word instead.
iChat will also set up Bonjour messaging automatically. Think of Bonjour 
as plug-and-play for your local network. In iChat, Bonjour messaging dis-
plays a separate window in which you can see (and yak with) anyone on 
your local network without having to know his iChat name. That’s because 
Bonjour automatically announces all the iChat users who are available on 
your network. If you have others using iChat, Jabber, or AIM on your local 
network, go for this option; if you’re not connected to a local network, how-
ever, Bonjour messaging isn’t necessary. Also, if you’re on a public AirPort/
AirPort Extreme network or if you’re connecting to the Internet with a 
modem through dial-up, I recommend disabling Bonjour messaging. (For all 
that’s cool about AirPort and its faster sibling AirPort Extreme, see Book VI, 
Chapter 3.)
After you finish these configuration necessities, iChat displays the Buddy 
List window (or, if you’re using Bonjour messaging, the two windows) that 
you see in Figure 3-1. Remember that your Bonjour window displays only 
those iChat folks on your local network.
A few things to note here about the Buddy List window:
 
✦ If you don’t like your picture, don’t panic. By default, iChat uses your 
user account thumbnail image as your visual persona. However, you can 
add a picture to your iChat iDentity — sorry, I couldn’t resist that — by 
dragging an image to the well next to your name at the top of the Buddy 
List window. If necessary, iChat asks you to position and size the image 
so that it fits in the (admittedly limited) space. This picture is then sent 
along with your words when you chat. In the figures for this chapter, I 
borrow the smiling face of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Start Screen Sharing button
 
✦ Check out the buttons along the bottom of the Buddy List window. In 
order, these buttons are
 
• Add a New Buddy (which I cover in the following section)
 
• Start a Text Chat (plain, old-fashioned chatting via the keyboard)
 
• Start an Audio Chat (chatting with your voice, using microphones)
 
• Start a Video Chat (the ultimate chat, where the parties can both see 
and hear each other)
 
• Start Screen Sharing (where you can view — or even remotely 
control — a buddy’s computer)
 
 Using these buttons can handle about 90 percent of the commands that 
you need to give while using iChat, so use ’em! (Note that the Bonjour 
window doesn’t have an Add a New Buddy button because the Buddy 
list in the Bonjour window is populated automatically by other iChat 
folks on your local network.)

Changing Modes in iChat
 
✦ Hey, look, there’s an iChat menu bar icon! When you’re running iChat, 
you can choose to add a balloon menu bar icon in the upper-right corner 
of your screen. Click it to display the options that you see in Figure 3-2. 
You can change your online/offline status, immediately invite a Buddy 
for a chat, or display the Buddy list (which I discuss later in the section, 
“Will You Be My Buddy?”). The menu bar icon appears only if you enable 
the Show Status in Menu Bar check box. Click iChat in the menu and 
choose Preferences; then click the General button in the Preferences 
dialog’s toolbar.

Changing Modes in iChat
To launch iChat, you can click its icon from the Dock or launch it from its 
iChat application icon (which you find in your Applications folder). Or, you 
can click its menu bar icon, which is grayed out when you’re offline. If you’re 
not already familiar with the terms online and offline, here’s the scoop: When 
you’re online, folks can invite you to chat and communicate with you. When 
you’re offline, you’re disconnected: iChat isn’t active, you can’t be paged, 
and you can’t chat.

525
Will You Be My Buddy?
Even when you’re offline, you can choose Available from the friendly balloon 
Finder menu bar icon, which automatically switches iChat to online mode. 
Or you can click a Buddy name directly, which automatically switches iChat 
to online mode and opens the paging window for that Buddy. (Naturally, you 
have to have the proper network or Internet connection first.)
You can use another mode, Away, whenever iChat is running and you’re 
still online but not available. For example, if I’m away from my MacBook for 
a few minutes, I leave iChat running but I switch myself to Away mode. My 
Buddies get a message saying that I’m Away, so they won’t bother trying to 
contact me. When I return to my laptop, I simply swipe my finger across the 
trackpad, and iChat intelligently inquires as to whether I’d like to return to 
Available mode. You can also use the menu bar icon to switch from Away to 
Available (or my other favorite mode, Twiddling My Thumbs). Refer to Figure 
3-2 to see these choices.
 
iChat can even display the iTunes song you’re listening to at the moment. 
Pick Current iTunes Song from the menu and impress your friends with your 
digital audio techno-powers.
Speaking of modes, you, too, can create a custom mode — like Bored stiff! 
or Listening to the Pointy-Haired Boss — and use it instead of the somewhat 
mundane choices of Available and Away. To do this, display the Buddy List 
window, click the word Available beneath your name (refer to Figure 3-2), 
and a drop-down menu appears. Click Custom Available or Custom Away to 
create your new mode. An edit box appears, in which you can type the new 
mode; press Return to automatically add the newcomer to your mode list. 
You can also switch modes from this pop-up menu.
To choose an existing mode, click it; modes with a green bullet are online 
modes, and red bullet modes are offline modes. (Apple provides you with 
some starting choices, like Surfing the Web for Available and In a Meeting 
for Away.) Notice in Figure 3-2 that I created a custom mode called Getting 
Another Diet Coke . . . cAfFeInE fills my life.
Will You Be My Buddy?
I know that question sounds a little personal, but in iChat, a Buddy is anyone 
whom you want to chat with, whether the topic is work related or your per-
sonal life. iChat keeps track of your Buddies in the Buddy list. You can also 
add them to your Address Book or use the AIM entry in an Address Book 
contact to generate a new Buddy identity.

526
Will You Be My Buddy?
To add a new Buddy, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Buddies➪Add Buddy, or click the Add Buddy button at the 
bottom of the iChat window and click Add Buddy from the pop-up 
menu, or press Ô+Shift+A.
 
2. To create a Buddy entry from an Address Book contact who has an 
Instant Messaging username, click the down-arrow button next to the 
Last Name box to display the Address Book list. Click the entry to 
select it.
 
 As a shortcut, you can also click in the First Name box and then type the 
person’s first name, or click in the Account Name box and type the per-
son’s Instant Messaging account name.
 
3. To add a brand-new person who’s not already in your Address 
Book, type the person’s Instant Messaging account name and click 
the pop-up menu to select the proper account type (either MobileMe 
or AIM).
 
4. Click Add to save the Buddy information.
 
Even when you add a new Buddy and that name appears in the Buddy list, 
don’t be surprised if the name actually fades out after a few seconds — that 
indicates that the person is offline and unavailable. You can also tell when a 
person is available if her name appears with a green bullet in the Buddy list.
You can also specify a number of actions that iChat should take if a Buddy 
logs in or out of Instant Messaging, or if a Buddy changes his or her status 
to Available. To display these actions, click the desired Buddy’s entry in 
your Buddy list and then press Ô+Shift+I. Click the Actions button and then 
choose the event that should trigger the action from the Event pop-up menu. 
Select the desired check box to specify whether iChat should play the sound 
that you select, run an AppleScript, or animate the iChat icon by “bouncing” 
it in the Dock.
Click the Address Card button on the Info dialog to enter or edit the person’s
 
✦ Real name
 
✦ Nickname
 
✦ E-mail
 
✦ Buddy icon
iChat obligingly creates an entry in your Address Book for your new Buddy. 
(Apple, you truly rock.)

Chat! Chat, I Say!
Chat! Chat, I Say!
Turn your attention to getting the attention of others — through inviting 
others to chat. Good chatting etiquette implies inviting someone to a conver-
sation rather than barging in unannounced.
If you want to join an AIM chat already in progress, choose File➪Go to Chat 
Room (or press Ô+Control+G). Depending on the service being used, you 
might have to specify both the type of chat and the specific chat room name.
At this point, it’s time to draw your attention to the green phone and video 
icons next to each person in your Buddy list (as well as next to your own 
name at the top of the list). If the green phone icon appears next to both 
your name and your buddy’s name, you can enjoy a two-way audio (or 
voice) chat. If your buddy (or buddies) are lucky enough to have iSight or 
DV cameras linked over a fast enough broadband connection, you can jump 
into a real-time, two-way video chat room, complete with audio. (Naturally, 
your MacBook is already equipped with an iSight camera.) Time for a very 
important Mark’s Maxim that’s violated a surprising number of times:
 
Always wear a shirt while chatting with video, no matter your impressive 
physique. Always.
 
If you don’t see these icons, click the Video menu and make sure that the 
Microphone Enabled and Camera Enabled menu items are selected.
To invite someone, click the desired Buddy from the Buddy list, click 
Buddies, and then choose Invite to Chat. (Right-click — using two fingers on 
the trackpad — the Buddy in the list and click Invite to Chat.) You can also 
click directly on the phone or camera icon next to the person’s name in your 
Buddy list. iChat displays the Group Chat window that you see in Figure 3-3, 
which also doubles as an Invitation window.
 
You can invite additional Buddies to enter the chat by clicking the plus 
button at the bottom left of the Participants list and choosing another 
Buddy. If the Participants list isn’t visible, click the View menu and choose 
Show Chat Participants.
Type your invitation text into the entry box at the bottom of the window. If 
you want to use bold or italic text, highlight the text and press Ô+B for Bold 
(B) or Ô+I for Italic (I). You can also add a Smiley (often called an emoticon) 
to your invitation text: Click in the desired spot in the text, click the Smiley 
button to the right of the text entry field, and then choose the proper Smiley 
from the list. To send the invitation text, press Return.
The recipient of your chat invitation can decline or accept your chat invita-
tion. You’re notified (as delicately as possible) if the chat has been declined.

Chat! Chat, I Say!
 
Figure 3-3:

(Actually, 
this guy

money.)
 
To invite a Buddy to an audio chat, select that person in the Buddy list, click 
the Buddies menu, and then choose Invite to Audio Chat (or One-Way Audio 
Chat, if only one of you has a microphone). A video invitation works in a sim-
ilar fashion: Click Buddies and choose either Invite to Video Chat or Invite to 
One-Way Video Chat, depending on the hardware available. (Need I mention 
that you can just right-click [or Control-click] the person in your Buddy list 
and choose these commands from the shortcut menu that appears?)
If the chat is accepted, iChat displays a message saying that the Buddy 
whom you invited has joined the chat, and you now can begin the chat. 
You don’t have to alternate sending messages back and forth between 
participants — everyone in a chat can compose and send messages at the 
same time — but I personally like to alternate when I’m chatting one on one. 
By the way, you might notice that AIM users are represented by the AIM 
Running Dude icon (unless AOL changes it, or you assign an icon picture 
of your own, as I describe in the “Configuring iChat” section, earlier in the 
chapter).
If someone invites you to a chat, you get the opposite side of the coin: 
A prompt dialog appears, and you can choose to accept or decline the 
invitation. (If it’s a video chat, you even get a video preview of the 
person inviting you.)
 
You can resize the Chat window by using the handle at the bottom-right 
corner, just as you can most other application windows in Mac OS X.
You can also change fonts and colors while composing a line of text. Simply 
select the text and then choose Format➪Show Fonts or Format➪Show Colors 
(or press Ô+T or Ô+Shift+C) to display the Fonts and Colors windows, 
respectively. These windows can be resized and moved wherever you like.

To save the discussion in a chat, choose File➪Save a Copy As. In the dialog 
that appears, type a name for the chat file, select a location where you want 
to store the file, and then click Save. To automatically save transcripts of all 
your chats, choose iChat➪Preferences and click Messages; then select the 
Automatically Save Chat Transcripts To check box. By default, the tran-
scripts are saved in an iChat folder that’s created inside your Documents 
folder in your Home folder. You can, however, click the pop-up menu to 
choose another location if you like.
When the iChat window is active, a number of display choices can be made 
from the View menu. Click the Messages item in the View menu to display 
these options, including
 
✦ Show as Text: Each line that you write and receive in a chat can be dis-
played in balloons, just like your favorite comic — the default — or as 
simple text. You can also choose to display text lines in the more tradi-
tional boxes or as compact text (allowing more room for more charac-
ters in the iChat window).
 
✦ Show Names and Pictures: Each line can be displayed with the individu-
al’s picture, just the name, or both the name and picture.
If you’re tired of the default background for the chat window, click View and 
choose the Set Chat Background menu item to choose a graphic to use for 
the Chat window. To return to the original appearance, choose the Clear 
Background menu item.
 
Click the Buddy list, and the View menu offers a different set of controls: You 
can sort your Buddy list by first name, last name, or availability; you can 
also toggle the display of offline Buddies. These options are also available 
from the Buddy List window toolbar.
Sending SMS messages and e-mail within iChat
iChat doesn’t limit you to just a chat between 
computers! Choose File➪Send SMS and you 
can hold an SMS (Short Message Service) 
conversation with anyone using a digital mobile 
phone. iChat prompts you for the mobile-phone 
number, and the connection is made auto-
matically. The SMS chat window looks just like 
the standard iChat text chat window. (Need I 
warn you that the charge for text messaging 
can bankrupt an unsuspecting teenager in an 
hour?)
You can also choose to ship off an e-mail mes-
sage from within iChat. Click a person in the 
Buddy list and click the Buddies menu; then 
click Send Email to automatically launch Apple 
Mail.

Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
 
Curious about the capabilities of your Mac hardware in iChat? Choose 
Video➪Connection Doctor, where you can view statistics and information 
about your current chat, display the features of iChat that are supported by 
your Mac, and view any error messages that are generated by iChat during 
this session.
To close a chat, click the Close button on the Chat window.
Sharing Screens and iChat Theater
How often have you wanted to show someone a neat new application, or 
lead your Aunt Mildred through the paces of setting up an Apple TV connec-
tion on her system? That’s the idea behind the ultimate collaboration tool, 
sharing screens, where you can watch (or even remotely control) the display 
on another person’s Mac — across any broadband Internet or local network 
connection!
Screen sharing must be turned on for you to send or receive sharing invites. 
Choose Video➪Screen Sharing Enabled — a check mark appears next to the 
menu item when the feature is enabled.
If a buddy invites you to share a screen, you receive a prompt that lets you 
accept or decline. If you accept the sharing invitation, iChat automatically 
initiates an audio chat (so that you can gab away to each other while things 
are happening on-screen). Suddenly, you’re seeing the Desktop and applica-
tions that your buddy is running, and you can both control the cursor and 
left- or right-click the mouse.
Throughout the screen-sharing session, iChat maintains a semi-opaque panel 
on your screen that has three buttons:
 
✦ End the Shared Screen Session: Click this button to exit shared screen 
mode.
 
✦ Switch Desktops: Click this button to swap between your MacBook’s 
screen and the remote Mac’s screen. (Those Mac owners who have 
enabled Fast User Switching will recognize the cool screen swap 
animation.)
 
✦ Mute Audio: Click this button to mute the audio during the screen-
sharing session.
To invite a buddy to share your screen, choose Buddies➪Share My Screen.

Sending Files with iChat
 
Okay, if sharing a screen with someone you don’t absolutely know and trust 
doesn’t set off alarm bells in your cranium, it should. Remember, anyone 
with shared screen access can perform most of the same actions as you can, 
just as if that person were sitting in front of your MacBook. Granted, most of 
the truly devastating things would require you to type your admin password, 
but a malicious individual could still delete files or wreak havoc any number 
of ways on your system. Be careful with whom you share your screen!
But wait . . . What if you don’t want to control Aunt Mildred’s Mac? Perhaps 
you just want to share a document instead? For example, you could show off 
some photos or a movie you’ve just finished. That’s the idea behind iChat 
Theater, where you can share a document or video and hold a conversation 
while viewing the content! iChat Theater falls in between Screen Sharing and 
a simple file download, which I cover in the next section.
To select one or more items for your Theater show, choose File➪Share 
iPhoto with iChat Theater (to share images from your iPhoto library) or 
File➪Share a File with iChat Theater (to share movies and other documents). 
iChat displays a standard Open dialog, in which you can select one or more 
items. When you’re ready to begin your Theater presentation, click Share. If 
you’re using a video camera, your video appears as a thumbnail, while your 
content gets center stage.
 
iChat Theater works with anything that can be displayed in Quick Look or 
located with Spotlight, including slideshows from iPhoto, a Keynote presen-
tation, or a QuickTime movie.
Sending Files with iChat
To send a file to a Buddy, click the desired entry in the Buddy list and then 
choose Buddies➪Send File. Alternatively, you can use the Ô+Option+F key-
board shortcut; right-click and choose Send a File; drag the file from a Finder 
window to the person’s entry in the Buddy list; or even drag the file into 
the text typing window. (How’s that for convenience?) A dialog appears to 
indicate that the recipient is being offered a file transfer request. If the file 
request is accepted by your Buddy, the transfer begins and is saved where 
the recipient specifies on her system.
If a Buddy sends you a file, the Incoming File Request pane appears. You can 
then either click the Decline button (to decline the file transfer) or the Save 
File button (to save the incoming file to any spot on your system).
 
Always check any files that you receive from iChat with your antivirus scan-
ning software before you run them!

Eliminating the Riffraff
Eliminating the Riffraff
Here I need to explain something that I hope you won’t have to use — what 
I like to call the Turkey Filter. (iChat is a little more subtle — you just ignore 
people.)
To ignore someone in a chat group, click her name in the list and choose 
Buddies➪Ignore <person>. When someone is ignored in a chat group, you 
don’t see anything that she types or have to respond to any file transfer 
requests from that person.
If only it were that easy to ignore someone when he’s standing close to you.
Anyway, if the person becomes a royal pain, you can also choose to block 
that person entirely. That way, the offensive cur doesn’t even know that 
you’re online, and he can’t reach you at all. Click the person in the list and 
choose Buddies➪Block <person> — the deed is done.
Adding Visual Effects
Our esteemed Apple software developers decided to bring a little Hollywood 
special effects “flash” to iChat with video backdrops. You can also use many 
of the special effects filters provided by Photo Booth to keep your video 
chat room laughing!
To add a video backdrop to your video feed, choose Video➪Video Preview 
to display your stunning self in a live video feed; then choose Video➪Show 
Video Effects. Use the scroll buttons to move to the backdrop thumbnails 
toward the end of the Effects library. When you click one, iChat prompts 
you to leave the frame for a few seconds so that the plain background 
behind you can be correctly “masked” (just like those blockbuster special 
effects used in today’s films). When your background has been captured and 
masked, iChat prompts you to return to your spot, and you’ll see that your 
new static or animated backdrop is in place. Just plain cool!
 
The plainer the background behind you, the better iChat can process and 
mask your background. A plain wall painted a single color works best.
“But, Mark, I want my own movies and photos for backgrounds!” No 
problem — you’ll notice that iChat provides six user-defined backdrop slots 
for your own selections at the end of the Video Effects collection. (Click the 
right scroll arrow in the Video Effects window until you reach the last couple 
of pages.) To add your own visuals, you can:

✦ Drag a photo from iPhoto to an empty User Backdrop well in the Video

✦ Drag a video or photo from a Finder window to an empty User Backdrop 
well in the Video Effects window.
 
As long as an item can be displayed in Quick Look, it can be used as a video 
background. Think of the possibilities!
To try out a Photo Booth effect in iChat, choose Video➪Video Preview to 
display your live video feed; next, chooseVideo➪Show Video Effects (or 
press Ô+Shift+E). Figure 3-4 illustrates the Video Preview and Video Effects 
windows; click a video effect thumbnail to see how it looks on you in the 
Preview window! Effects range from simple Black & White to a Thermal 
Camera look, an Andy Warhol–style Pop Art display, and a number of really 
cool optical distortions (such as Twirl and Light Tunnel).

After you find just the right video effect, close the two windows and start

more conventional, display the Video Effects window again and click the

thumbnails).

Book VI: The Typical Internet Stuff

Chapter 4: Expanding Your 
Horizons with iDisk
In This Chapter
✓ Setting up iDisk
✓ Using files and folders on your iDisk
✓ Using public files
I
f you ask the average MacBook owner about what’s available on the 
Internet, you likely hear benefits, such as e-mail, Web surfing, RSS feeds, 
Google, and instant communication via iChat. What you may not hear is 
“Convenient, trouble-free storage for my files and folders.”
You might have tried to use one of the dozens of storage sites on the 
Internet that allows you to upload and download files from a personal file 
area via your Web browser. Unfortunately, these Web-based storage sites 
are slow in transferring files and lacking in convenience, and they typically 
offer only a small amount of space. As a result, most computer owners 
decide that the idea of online storage is neat . . . but impractical.
In this chapter, I show you what real online storage is all about. I’m talk-
ing about iDisk, which is the online storage feature that’s integrated into 
the Mac OS X Finder. No jury-rigged Web site is necessary (although you 
can use one if you’re not on a Mac running Snow Leopard). I admit that 
online storage doesn’t replace the hard drives on your MacBook, but with a 
MobileMe subscription, you can easily make use of online storage for back-
ups and sharing files with your friends . . . from anywhere on the planet, 
road warrior!
So how do you actually use iDisk? That’s the simple part! To use iDisk within 
Mac OS X, just do what comes naturally — it works the same as any other 
removable volume’s Finder window. You can copy and move files and fold-
ers to and from your iDisk, create new subfolders (except in the Backup, 
Library, and Software root folders, which are read-only), and delete what-
ever you don’t need.

536
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your MacBook
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your MacBook
To set up iDisk on your Mac OS X system, you need a MobileMe account. 
You did create one during the installation of the Big X, right? These trial 
accounts are active for 60 days. To subscribe, visit www.me.com and follow 
the prompts to join from there. (At the time of this writing, the subscription 
fee for an individual account is $99 per year from Apple (however, Amazon.
com sells MobileMe subscriptions for significantly less). You need a credit 
card to create a MobileMe account, but you can cancel your trial account at 
any time.)
Here’s a bit of good news: Other than the 60-day limit, there’s almost no dif-
ference between a MobileMe trial account and a full, $99 yearly subscription, 
so you can try out all the MobileMe features, exactly as though you were 
already paying for them. Sweet!
With an active MobileMe account, iDisk is available automatically. To see 
how much storage you’re using and to configure access to your Public 
folder, open System Preferences, click the MobileMe icon, and then click the 
iDisk button to display the settings that you see in Figure 4-1. (You can also 
click the Upgrade Storage button on this pane to subscribe to MobileMe, or 
if you’re already a MobileMe subscriber, add storage space.)

The iDisk Disk Space bar graph illustrates how much of your current iDisk 
territory you’re using.

Expanding Your 
Horizons with iDisk
537
Grabbing Internet Storage for Your MacBook
You can specify the access privilege level for other MobileMe users from 
this pane as well. Select the Read Only radio button to prevent any other 
MobileMe user from copying files to your Public folder, or select the Read & 
Write radio button to allow others to save files there.
No matter which privilege level you choose, you can also set a password 
that other MobileMe users must type before they’re allowed access to your 
Public folder. This is the very definition of A Truly Good Idea. (More on the 
Public folder in the next section.)
 
If you’ve already set a password, you can change it by clicking the Set 
Password button and typing the new word in the Password box. Retype the 
word in the Confirm box to verify it; then click OK to save the change and 
return to the MobileMe System Preferences pane.
Pinning down your iDisk
So where exactly are your files kept when 
you use your iDisk? In earlier versions of Mac 
OS X, your acre of storage farmland always 
sat exclusively on one of Apple’s iDisk file 
servers — perhaps in Cupertino, perhaps 
elsewhere. These server computers are 
especially designed to store terabytes (TB) of 
information (1TB equals 1,000GB), and they’re 
connected to the Internet via high-speed trunk 
lines. (And yes, they do have a firewall.) Your 
Internet copy of your iDisk is still stored on an 
Apple file server.
However, you can elect to keep a local copy 
of your iDisk storage area — usually called 
a mirror — on your MacBook’s hard drive. 
Before you scratch your head wondering why 
you’re duplicating your iDisk files on your com-
puter, here’s the reason: If you do decide to 
keep a local copy of your files, you can work on 
them even when you’re not connected to the 
Internet! Snow Leopard automatically synchro-
nizes any files that you’ve updated locally with 
your remote iDisk whenever you connect to the 
Internet. (If you use multiple Macs at different 
locations, think about being able to access the 
latest copies of your files from any of them, 
right from the Finder!)
This nifty mirror also greatly speeds up things 
when you’re browsing the contents of your 
iDisk or perhaps loading and saving an iDisk 
document; that’s because you’re working with 
your local copy, and Mac OS X updates any 
changes that you make to the corresponding 
remote file on the iDisk server. You can tell 
that things are updating when that funky little 
yin-yang, circular doodad — the thing next to 
your iDisk in the Finder window — is rotating 
in its animated fashion. (And yes, I have it on 
good authority: That’s what the Apple software 
developers call it, too.)
You’re not required to use a mirror, however. 
To disable the mirroring feature and return 
to the remote-only operation of old, click the 
iDisk Syncing Stop button on the iDisk pane in 
System Preferences to turn it off. Remember, 
though, that with the mirroring feature turned 
off, you must have an Internet connection to 
use iDisk, and things will move more slowly 
because you’re accessing everything across 
the Internet.

538
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
Understanding What’s on Your iDisk
In contrast to the physical hard drive in your MacBook, your iDisk never 
needs formatting or defragmenting, and you never have to check it for 
errors. However, the structure of an iDisk is fixed, so you can’t just go crazy 
creating your own folders. In fact, you can’t create new folders at the root — 
the top level — of your iDisk at all, but you can create new folders inside 
most of the root folders.
Now that you’re thoroughly rooterized, here are the folders that you find 
hanging out in your iDisk:
 
✦ Backup: This is a read-only folder that contains the backup files created 
with the MobileMe Backup application. You can, however, copy the files 
in this folder to a removable drive on your system for an additional level 
of safekeeping.
 
✦ Documents: This folder holds any application documents that you want 
to store — things like spreadsheets and letters. No one but you can 
access these items; you can, however, tag items in the Documents folder 
as shared, allowing individuals or groups to download them using an 
access code sent by MobileMe in an e-mail message. Sharing files is a 
great way to transfer files too big to send as e-mail attachments.
 
✦ Groups: This folder holds files that you want to share with others in any 
MobileMe Groups you might have joined.
 
✦ Library: Another read-only folder. This spot contains the configuration 
data and custom settings that you’ve created for other MobileMe 
features.
 
✦ Movies: QuickTime movies go here — again, you can add the movies 
stored here to your Web pages. (I cover QuickTime like a blanket in 
Book IV, Chapter 8.)
 
✦ Music: This is the repository for all your iTunes music and playlists, 
and the contents can be added to your Web pages. (iTunes is the star of 
Chapter 2 in Book IV.) Mine is stuffed full of Mozart, Scarlatti, and that 
Bach fellow.
 
✦ Pictures: This folder is the vault for your JPEG and GIF images, including 
those that you want to use with your Web pages.
 
✦ Public: This is the spot to place files that you specifically want to share 
with others, either directly through iDisk or with your Web pages. If 
you’ve allowed write access, others can copy files to your Public folder 
as well.
 
✦ Sites: The Web pages that you store here can be created with iWeb, 
which I cover in Book IV, Chapter 7. In fact, you can even use your own 
Web page design application and copy the completed site files here.

Horizons with iDisk

Opening and Using iDisk
 
✦ Software: Apple provides this read-only folder as a service to MobileMe 
members; it contains a selection of the latest freeware, shareware, and 
commercial demos for you to enjoy. To try something out, open the 
Software folder and copy whatever you like to your Mac OS X Desktop. 
Then you can install and run the application from the local copy of the 
files.
 
✦ Web: This folder holds your MobileMe Galleries created from within 
iPhoto, as well as other media used by iWeb.
Opening and Using iDisk
When you’re connected to the Internet, you can open your iDisk in one of 
the following ways:
 
✦ From the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk and then choose My iDisk 
from the submenu or use the Ô+Shift+I keyboard shortcut.
 
✦ Click the iDisk icon in the Finder Sidebar.
 
✦ Add an iDisk button to your Finder window toolbar by choosing 
View➪Customize Toolbar.
 
 After you add the button, you can click it to connect to your iDisk from 
anywhere in the Finder.
Your iDisk opens in a new Finder window. After you use one of these meth-
ods in a Mac OS X session, your iDisk icon appears on the Mac OS X Desktop; 
Figure 4-2 shows the iDisk contents in a Finder window. The iDisk volume 
icon remains until you shut down or restart your MacBook. (Alternatively, 
you can dismiss the iDisk volume icon from your Desktop using the same 
method by which you eject an external drive: Click the iDisk icon and press 
Ô+E or click the Eject button next to the iDisk icon in the Finder window 
Sidebar.)
 
Figure 4-2: 
The con-
tents of your 
iDisk — 
pretty iNeat, 
I’m thinking.
 

540
Opening and Using iDisk
 
If you’re using a remote PC with an Internet connection, you can log in to the 
MobileMe page at www.me.com and use your Web browser to access the 
contents of your iDisk. (Hey, sometimes this is the only choice you have.)
However, you don’t actually need to open your iDisk in a Finder window to 
use it, because you can also load and save files directly to your iDisk from 
within any application. Simply choose your iDisk as you would any of the 
hard drives on your system when using the application’s Open, Save, or Save 
As commands.
You can also open an iDisk Public folder — either yours or the Public folder 
inside another person’s iDisk — as if it were an Internet file server. As I 
explain earlier in the chapter, if that person has set a password, you need 
to enter that password to gain access to all of his or her iDisk folders. From 
the Finder menu, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s iDisk (or, to jump directly 
to their Public folder, choose Go➪iDisk➪Other User’s Public Folder). If 
you choose the former, Snow Leopard prompts you for the other person’s 
member name and password; if you pick the latter, you need only enter the 
other MobileMe member’s account name.
After you enter a valid iDisk member name (and password, if required), you 
see the MobileMe member’s Public folder.
 
You can also use the server address
http://idisk.me.com/username-Public?
to connect to an iDisk from computers running Windows and Linux. Check 
the Help for your operating system to determine how to connect to a 
WebDAV server (usually called a Web folder in the Windows world). When 
prompted for your access username and password, use your MobileMe 
account name and password. If you’re using Windows XP or Vista, Apple has 
provided an even easier way to manage your iDisk: Use MobileMe Control 
Panel for Windows, which you can download from www.me.com.

W
hen I was designing the Table of Contents for this book, I seriously 
considered leaving this chapter out. After all, more people use a 
Web browser now than any other software application. Who really needs a 
guide to mowing a lawn?
But then again, I suddenly thought of all the hidden features that folks 
don’t know about Apple’s Safari browser — for example, the tips and tricks 
that can help you organize your online visits. It’s a little like finding out 
more about the lawn mower itself: Even though you might not need tips 
on mowing, many people don’t know how to remove the spark plug in the 
winter or how to sharpen the blade so that you can handle taller grass. 
To put it another way, magic is nothing more than technology that someone 
understands.
In this chapter, I show you how to use those other controls and toolbar but-
tons in Safari — you know, the ones in addition to the Forward and Back 
buttons — and you discover how to keep track of where you’ve been and 
where you’d like to go. (Oh, and did I mention that you need an Internet 
connection?)
One note: Many authors have written entire books on Web browsing. As 
you might guess, this chapter is far narrower in scope than those books — 
I have more ground to cover before dinner — and it doesn’t include every 
one of Safari’s features. However, I think the coverage that you find here 
explains all that you’re likely to need for most surfing sessions.

Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Pretend You’ve Never Used This Thing
Figure 5-1 illustrates the Safari window. You can launch Safari directly from 
the Dock or you can click the Safari icon within your Applications folder.
Major sections of the Safari window include
 
✦ The toolbar: You’ll find the most often used commands on this toolbar — 
for tasks such as navigation, adding bookmarks, and searching Google. 
Plus, here you can type or paste the address for Web sites that you’d like 
to visit. The toolbar can be hidden to provide you with more real estate 
in your browser window for Web content. To toggle hidden mode, press 
Ô+| (the vertical bar right above the backslash) or choose View➪Hide/
Show Toolbar.
 
✦ The Bookmarks bar: Consider this a toolbar that allows you to jump 
directly to your favorite Web sites with a single click or two. I show you 
later, in the section “Adding and Using Bookmarks,” how to add and 
remove sites from your Bookmarks bar. For now, remember that you 
can toggle the display of the Bookmarks bar by choosing View➪Hide/
Show Bookmarks Bar or by pressing Ô+Shift+B.

Visiting Web Sites
 
✦ The Content window: Congratulations! At last, you’ve waded through 
all the pregame show and you’ve reached the area where Web pages are 
actually displayed. As can any other window, the Content window can 
be scrolled; when you minimize Safari to the Dock, you get a thumbnail 
(minimized) image of the Content window.
 
 
The Content window often contains underlined text and graphical icons 
that transport you to other pages when you click them. These under-
lined words and icons are links, and they make it easy to move from one 
area of a site to another or to a completely different site.
 
✦ The status bar: The status bar displays information about what the 
cursor is currently resting upon, such as the address for a link or the 
name of an image; it also updates you on what’s happening while a page 
is loading. To hide or display the status bar, press Ô+/ (forward slash) 
or choose View➪Hide/Show Status Bar.
Visiting Web Sites
Here’s the stuff that virtually everyone over the age of five knows how to 
do . . . but I get paid by the word, and some folks might not be aware of the 
myriad ways of visiting a site. You can load a Web page using any of the fol-
lowing methods:
 
✦ Type (or paste) a Web site address into the Address box on the toolbar 
and then press Return.
 
 If you’re typing in an address and Safari recognizes the site as one that 
you’ve visited in the past, it helps by completing the address for you. 
Press Return if you want to accept the suggested site. If this is a new 
site, just keep typing.
 
 The latest version of Safari includes a Smart Address field that displays 
a new pop-up menu of sites that match the text you’ve entered. Safari 
does this by using sites taken from your History file and your book-
marks. If the site you want to visit appears in the list, click it to jump 
there immediately.
 
✦ Click a Bookmarks entry within Safari.
 
✦ Click the Home button, which takes you to the home page that you 
specify.
 
 More on this in the section “Setting Up Your Home Page,” later in this 
chapter.
 
✦ Click the Show Top Sites button on the toolbar.
 
 Safari displays a wall of preview thumbnail pages from your most fre-
quently visited sites, and you can jump to a site just by clicking on 
the preview. Click the Edit button on the Top Sites screen to delete a 

544
Navigating the Web
preview thumbnail — click the X — or you can “anchor” a thumbnail to 
keep it on the screen permanently by clicking the pin icon next to the 
desired thumbnail. You can also choose the size of the preview thumb-
nails in Edit mode.
 
 
Because each thumbnail is updated with the most current content, the 
Top Sites wall makes a great time-saver — you can quickly make a visual 
check of all your favorite haunts from one screen!
 
✦ Click a page link in Apple Mail or another Internet-savvy application.
 
 Some Mac applications require you to hold down Ô while clicking to 
open a Web page.
 
✦ Click a page link within another Web page.
 
✦ Use the Google box in the toolbar.
 
 Click in the Google box, type the contents that you want to find, and 
then press Return. Safari presents you with the search results page on 
Google for the text that you entered. (In case you’ve been living under 
the Internet equivalent of a rock for the last couple of years, Google.com 
is the preeminent search site on the Web — people use Google to find 
everything from used auto parts to ex-spouses.)
 
✦ Click a Safari page icon in the Dock or a Finder window.
 
 For example, Mac OS X already has an icon in the Dock that takes you 
to the Mac OS X page on the Apple Web site. Drag a site from your 
Bookmarks bar and drop it on the right side of the Dock. Clicking the 
icon that you add launches Safari and automatically loads that site.
 
 
This trick works only on the side of the Dock to the right of the vertical 
line.
If you minimize Safari to the Dock, you’ll see a thumbnail of the page with the 
Safari logo superimposed on it. Click this thumbnail in the Dock to restore 
the page to its full glory.
Navigating the Web
A typical Web surfing session is a linear experience — you bop from one 
page to the next, absorbing the information that you want and discarding 
the rest. However, after you visit a few sites, you might find that you need 
to return to where you’ve been or head to the familiar ground of your home 
page. Safari offers these default navigational controls on the toolbar:
 
✦ Back: Click the Back button (the left-facing arrow) on the toolbar to 
return to the last page you visited. Additional clicks take you to previous 
pages, in reverse order. The Back button is disabled if you haven’t vis-
ited at least two sites.

Book VI
Chapter 5
Surfing with Safari
545
Navigating the Web
 
✦ Forward: If you’ve clicked the Back button at least once, clicking the 
Forward button (the right-facing arrow) takes you to the next page (or 
through the pages) where you originally were, in forward order. The 
Forward button is disabled if you haven’t used the Back button.
 
✦ Home: Click this button (look for the little house) to return to your 
home page.
 
 
Not all these buttons and controls must appear on your toolbar. To dis-
play or hide toolbar controls, choose View➪Customize Toolbar. The sheet 
that appears works just like the Customize Toolbar sheet within a Finder 
window: Drag the control you want from the sheet to your Safari toolbar 
or drag a control that you don’t want from the toolbar to the sheet.
 
✦ AutoFill: If you fill out a lot of forms online — when you’re shopping at 
Web sites, for example — you can click the AutoFill button (which looks 
like a little text box and a pen) to complete these forms for you. You can 
set what information is used for AutoFill by choosing Safari➪Preferences 
and clicking the AutoFill toolbar button.
 
 
To be honest, I’m not a big fan of releasing any of my personal informa-
tion to any Web site, so I don’t use AutoFill often. If you do decide to use 
this feature, make sure that the connection is secure (look for the pad-
lock icon in the upper-right corner of the Safari window) and read the 
site’s Privacy Agreement page first to see how your identity data will be 
treated.
 
✦ Zoom: Shrinks or expands the size of text on the page, offering smaller, 
space-saving characters (for the shrinking crowd) or larger, easier-to-
read text (for the expanding crowd). Hence the button, which is labeled 
with a small and large letter A.
 
✦ Stop/Reload: Click Reload at the right side of the Address box (look for 
the circular arrow) to refresh (reload) the contents of the current page. 
Although most pages remain static, some pages change their content at 
regular intervals or after you fill out a form or click a button. By click-
ing Reload, you can see what’s changed on these pages. (I use Reload 
every hour or so with CNN.com, for example.) While a page is loading, 
the Reload button turns into the Stop button — with a little X mark — 
and you can click it to stop the loading of the content from the current 
page. This is a real boon when a download takes foorrevverr, which can 
happen when you’re trying to visit a very popular or very slow Web site 
(especially if you’re using a dial-up modem connection to the Internet). 
Using Stop is also handy if a page has a number of very large graphics 
that are likely to take a long time to load.
 
✦ Open in Dashboard: Click this button to create a Dashboard widget 
using the contents of the currently displayed Web page. Safari prompts 
you to choose which clickable section of the page to be included within 
the widget’s borders (such as the local radar map on your favorite 
weather Web site). Click Add, and Dashboard loads automatically with 
your new widget. (More on widgets in Book III, Chapter 2.)

546
Navigating the Web
 
✦ Add Bookmark: Click this toolbar button (which carries a plus sign) to 
add a page to your Bookmarks bar or Bookmarks menu. (More on this in 
a tad.)
 
✦ Google Search: As I mention earlier, you can click in this box and type 
text that you want to find on the Web via the Google search engine; 
press Return to display the results. To repeat a recent search, click 
the down arrow in the Google Search box and select it from the pop-up 
menu.
 
✦ Print: Click this convenient button to print the contents of the Safari 
window. (Dig that crazy printer icon!)
 
✦ Report Bug: A rather strange creature, the Safari Bug button makes 
it easy to alert Apple when you encounter a page that doesn’t display 
properly in Safari. (Software developers call such glitches bugs — hence 
the name.) When you click the Bug button, you’ll see a sheet with the 
settings shown in Figure 5-2; take time to enter a short description of 
the problem that you’re having. (I also click More Options to enable the 
Send Screen Shot of Current Page and the Send Source of Current Page 
check boxes, giving the Apple folks more to work with while they’re 
debugging Safari.) Then click the Submit button to send the bug report 
to Apple.

Setting Up Your Home Page
Setting Up Your Home Page
Choosing a home page is one of the easiest methods of speeding up your 
Web surfing, especially if you’re using a dial-up modem connection. However, 
a large percentage of the Mac owners whom I’ve talked with have never set 
their own home page; instead, they simply use the default home page pro-
vided by their browser! With Safari running, take a moment to follow these 
steps to declare your own freedom to choose your own home page:
 
1. If you want to use a specific Web page as your new home page, dis-
play it in Safari.
 
 
I recommend selecting a page with few graphics or a fast-loading popu-
lar site.
 
2. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
3. Click the General button.
 
 You see the settings shown in Figure 5-3.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Adding 
your own 
home page 
is an easy 
change you 
can make.
 
 
4. Click the Set to Current Page button.

548
Adding and Using Bookmarks
 
5. Alternatively, click the New Windows Open With pop-up menu and 
choose Empty Page if you want Safari to open a new window with a 
blank page.
 
 This is the fastest choice of all for a home page.
 
 
Choose Top Sites from the New Windows Open With pop-up menu to 
display the Top Sites screen I described earlier each time you open a 
new window.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit the Preferences dialog.
 
Visit your home page at any time by pressing the Home button on the 
toolbar.
Adding and Using Bookmarks
No doubt about it: Bookmarks make the Web a friendly place. As you col-
lect bookmarks in Safari, you’re able to immediately jump from one site to 
another with a single click of the Bookmarks menu or the buttons on the 
Bookmarks bar.
Lean, fast, and mean — that’s RSS
Well, maybe not mean — after all, I don’t want 
you to be afraid of RSS (RDF Site Summary) 
pages! RSS Web sites display updated infor-
mation using a shortened list format, rather 
like a newspaper headline, without unneces-
sary graphics or silly advertisements. You can 
tell when a Web site has RSS pages available 
because Safari displays an RSS icon at the 
right side of the Address box on the toolbar. 
(When you click the RSS icon, the Web address 
switches to a feed:// prefix — another indi-
cation that you’re not in Kansas reading HTML 
pages anymore.)
To display more information about a news item 
on an RSS page, click the item headline. Safari 
opens the corresponding Web page — yep, 
once again you’re back in the world of HTML — 
and you can read the full story. To return to the 
RSS feed, click the Back button on the toolbar. 
Naturally, RSS feed pages can be bookmarked. 
In fact, Apple gives you a number of RSS sites 
that you can explore immediately.
To customize your RSS display, choose 
Safari➪Preferences and then click the RSS 
tab. By default, Safari checks for updated 
RSS headlines every 30 minutes, but you can 
change this to an hourly or daily check. (Of 
course, you can also check for updates manu-
ally by reloading the RSS page, just as you 
would any other Web page.) New articles 
can be assigned a highlighted color, and you 
can specify the amount of time an item should 
remain on the RSS page after it’s published.

Adding and Using Bookmarks
To add a bookmark, first navigate to the desired page and then do any of the 
following:
 
✦ Choose Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark.
 
✦ Press the Ô+D keyboard shortcut.
 
 Safari displays a sheet where you can enter the name for the book-
mark and also select where it appears (on the Bookmarks bar or the 
Bookmarks menu).
 
✦ Drag the icon next to the Web address from the Address field to the 
Bookmarks bar.
 
You can also drag a link on the current page to the Bookmarks bar, but note 
that doing this adds a bookmark only for the page corresponding to the 
link — not the current page.
To jump to a bookmark
 
✦ Choose it from the Bookmarks menu.
 
 If the bookmark is contained in a folder, which I discuss later in this sec-
tion, move your pointer over the folder name to show its contents and 
then click the bookmark.
 
✦ Click the bookmark on the Bookmarks bar.
 
 
If you’ve added a large number of items to the Bookmarks bar, click the 
More icon on the edge of the Bookmarks bar to display the rest of the 
buttons.
 
✦ Click the Show All Bookmarks button (which looks like a small, 
opened book) on the Bookmarks bar and then click the desired 
bookmark.
 
 The Bookmarks window that you see in Figure 5-4 appears — complete 
with swank Cover Flow display — where you can review each collection 
of bookmarks at leisure. As you might expect, Safari’s Cover Flow works 
just as the Cover Flow view does in a Finder window.
 
 The more bookmarks you add, the more unwieldy the Bookmarks menu 
and the Bookmarks window become. To keep things organized, choose 
Bookmarks➪Add Bookmark Folder and then type a name for the new 
folder. With folders, you can organize your bookmarks into collections, 
which appear in the column at the left of the Bookmarks window (or as 
separate submenus within the Bookmarks menu). You can drag book-
marks into the new folder to help reduce the clutter.
To delete a bookmark or a folder from the Bookmarks window, click it and 
then press Delete.

Downloading Files
 
Figure 5-4: 
The 
Bookmarks 
window

bookmarks 
within easy

Downloading Files
A huge chunk of the fun that you’ll find on the Web is the ability to download 
images and files. If you’ve visited a site that offers files for downloading, typi-
cally you just click the Download button or the download file link, and Safari 
takes care of the rest. You’ll see the Downloads status window, which keeps 
you updated as to the progress of the transfer. While the file is downloading, 
feel free to continue browsing or even download additional files; the status 
window helps you keep track of what’s going on and when everything will be 
finished transferring. To display the Download status window from the key-
board, press Ô+Option+L.
By default, Safari saves any downloaded files to the Downloads folder that 
appears in your Dock, which I like and use. To specify the location where 
downloaded files are stored — for example, if you’d like to save them 
directly to the desktop — follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences or press Ô+, (comma).
 
2. Click the General tab and then click the Save Downloaded Files To 
pop-up menu.
 
3. Choose Other.

551
Using Subscriptions and History
 
4. Navigate to the location where you want the files stored.
 
5. Click the Select button.
 
6. Click the Close button to exit Preferences.
To download a specific image that appears on a Web page, move your 
pointer over the image and right-click. Then choose Save Image As from the 
pop-up menu that appears. Safari prompts you for the location where you 
want to store the file.
You can choose to automatically open files that Safari considers safe — 
things like movies, text files, and PDF files that are very unlikely to store 
a virus or a damaging macro. By default, the Open “Safe” Files after 
Downloading check box is selected on the General pane. However, if you’re 
interested in preventing anything you download from running until you’ve 
manually checked it with your antivirus application, you can deselect the 
check box and breathe easy.
 
Luckily, Safari has matured to the point that it can seamlessly handle virtu-
ally any multimedia file type that it encounters. However, if you’ve down-
loaded a multimedia file and Safari doesn’t seem to be able to play or display 
it, try loading the file within QuickTime Player. As you can read in Book IV, 
Chapter 8, QuickTime Player is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia players, 
and it can recognize a huge number of audio, video, and image formats.
Using Subscriptions and History
To keep track of where you’ve been, you can display the History list by click-
ing the History menu. To return to a page in the list, just choose it from the 
History menu. Note that Safari also arranges older history items by the date 
you visited the site, so you can easily jump back a couple of days to that 
page you forgot to bookmark!
In fact, Safari also searches the History list automatically, when it fills in an 
address that you’re typing — that’s the feature I mention in the earlier sec-
tion “Visiting Web Sites.”
To view your Top Sites thumbnail screen, press Ô+Shift+1 or choose Show 
Top Sites from the History menu.
If you’re worried about security and would rather not keep track of where 
you’ve been online, I show you how to clear the contents of the History file 
in the “Handling ancient history” section, later in this chapter.

552
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Tabs Are Your Browsing Friends
Safari also offers tabbed browsing, which many folks use to display (and orga-
nize) multiple Web pages at one time. For example, if you’re doing a bit of 
comparison shopping for a new piece of hardware between different online 
stores, tabs are ideal.
When you hold down the Ô key and click a link or bookmark using tabs, a 
tab representing the new page appears at the top of the Safari window. Just 
click the tab to switch to that page. (If you don’t hold down Ô, things revert 
to business as usual, and Safari replaces the contents of the window with the 
new page.) If you hold down both Shift and Ô while you click, Safari opens 
a new tab and automatically switches to the new tab. Figure 5-5 illustrates a 
number of pages that I’ve opened in Safari using tabs.
You can also open a new tab by clicking the plus sign that appears at the 
upper-right corner of the Safari window.
To fine-tune your tabbed browsing experience, choose Safari➪Preferences 
to display the Preferences dialog; then click Tabs. From here, you can turn 
off the confirmation window that normally appears when you close Safari 
with multiple tabs or windows open. You can also specify whether a new tab 
or window automatically becomes the active window within Safari.

Saving Web Pages
 
Done with a page? You can remove a tabbed page by clicking the X button 
next to the tab’s title.
Saving Web Pages
If you’ve encountered a page that you’d like to load later, you can save it to 
disk in its entirety. (Just the text, mind you, not the images.) Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Display the desired page.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As or press Ô+S.
 
3. In the Save As text field, type a name for the saved page.
 
4. From the Where pop-up menu, navigate to the location where you 
want to store the file on your system.
 
 To expand the sheet to allow navigation to any location on your system, 
click the button with the downward arrow.
 
5. Click the Format pop-up menu to choose the format for the saved 
page.
 
 Usually, you’ll want to choose a Web Archive, which saves the entire 
page and can be displayed just as you see it. However, if you want to 
save just the HTML source code, choose Page Source.
 
6. Click Save to begin the download process.
 
 After the Save file has been created, double-click it to load it in Safari.
 
A quick word about printing a page within Safari: Some combinations of 
background and text colors might conspire together to render your printed 
copy practically worthless. In a case like that, use your printer’s grayscale 
setting (if it has one) or deselect the Print Backgrounds check box in the 
Print dialog. Alternatively, you can simply click and drag to select the text on 
the page, press Ô+C to copy it, and then paste the text into Word or Pages, 
where you can print the page on a less offensive background (while still 
keeping the text formatting largely untouched). You can also save the con-
tents of a page as plain text, as I just demonstrated.
 
If you’d rather mail the contents of a Web page to a friend — or just a link 
to the page, which is faster to send over a dial-up Internet connection — 
choose either File➪Mail Contents of This Page or File➪Mail Link to This

Protecting Your Privacy
Protecting Your Privacy
No chapter on Safari would be complete without a discussion of security, 
against both outside intrusion from the Internet and prying eyes around 
your MacBook. Hence this last section, which covers protecting your 
privacy.
 
Although diminutive, the padlock icon that appears at the top of the Safari 
window when you’re connected to a secure Web site means a great deal! A 
secure site encrypts the information that you send and receive, making it 
much harder for those of unscrupulous ideals to obtain things such as credit 
card numbers and personal information. You can click the padlock icon 
(next to the site name) to display the security certificate in use on that par-
ticular site.
Yes, there are such things as bad cookies
First, a definition of this ridiculous term: A cookie, a small file that a Web site 
automatically saves on your hard drive, contains information that the site 
will use on your future visits. For example, a site might save a cookie to pre-
serve your site preferences for the next time or — in the case of a site such 
as Amazon.com — to identify you automatically and help customize the 
offerings that you see.
In and of themselves, cookies aren’t bad things. Unlike a virus, a cookie file 
isn’t going to replicate itself or wreak havoc on your system, and only the 
original site can read the cookie that it creates. However, many folks don’t 
appreciate acting as a gracious host for a slew of little snippets of personal 
information. (Not to mention that some cookies have highly suggestive 
names, which could lead to all sorts of conclusions. End of story.)
You can choose to accept all cookies — the default — or you can opt to dis-
able cookies altogether. You can also set Safari to accept cookies only from 
the sites you choose to visit. To change your Cookie Acceptance Plan (or 
CAP, for those who absolutely crave acronyms), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Safari➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Security toolbar button.
 
 Safari displays the preference settings shown in Figure 5-6.
 
3. Choose how to accept cookies via these radio button choices:
 
 Never: Block cookies entirely.
 
 Always: Accept all cookies.
 
 Only from Sites You Navigate To: Personally, I use this option, which 
allows sites like Amazon.com to work correctly without allowing a 
barrage of illicit cookies.

4. To view the cookies currently on your system, click the Show Cookies 
button.
 
 
If a site’s cookies are blocked, you might have to take care of things 
manually, such as by providing a password on the site that used to be 
read automatically from the cookie.
 
5. Click the Close button to save your changes.
Cleaning your cache
Safari speeds up the loading of Web sites by storing often-used images and 
multimedia files in a temporary storage, or cache, folder. Naturally, the files 
in your cache folder can be displayed (hint), which could lead to assump-
tions (hint, hint) about the sites you’ve been visiting (hint, hint, hint). 
(Tactful, ain’t I?)
Luckily, Safari makes it easy to dump the contents of your cache file. Just 
choose Safari➪Empty Cache; then click Empty to confirm that you want to 
clean up your cache.
Handling ancient history
As you might imagine, your History file leaves a very clear set of footprints 
indicating where you’ve been on the Web. To delete the contents of the 
History menu, choose History➪Clear History (at the very bottom of the 
History menu).

556
Protecting Your Privacy
Safari also allows you to specify an amount of time to retain entries in your 
History file. Open the Safari Preferences dialog, click the General tab, and 
then click the Remove History Items pop-up menu to specify the desired 
amount of time. Items can be rolled off daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or 
yearly.
Avoiding those @*!^%$ pop-up ads
I hate pop-up ads, and I’m sure you do, too. To block most of those pop-up 
windows with advertisements for everything from low-rate mortgages to 
“sure-thing” Internet casinos, click the Safari menu and verify that Block 
Pop-Up Windows is selected. (If it’s not selected, click the menu item to 
toggle the menu item on.)
 
From time to time, you might run across a Web site that actually does some-
thing constructive with pop-up windows, such as present a download or 
login prompt. If you need to temporarily deactivate pop-up blocking, press 
Ô+Shift+K to toggle it off. Then press Ô+Shift+K again to turn pop-up block-
ing back on after you’ve finished with the site. 

Chapter 6: Staying Secure Online
In This Chapter
✓ Understanding the dangers of going online
✓ Using a firewall
✓ Avoiding trouble online
I
 know that you’ve heard horror stories about hacking: Big corporations 
and big government installations seem to be as open to hackers as a 
public library. Often, you read that even entire identities are being stolen 
online. When you consider that your MacBook can contain very sensitive 
and private information in your life — such as your Social Security number 
and financial information — it’s enough to make you nervous about turning 
on your computer long enough to check your eBay auctions.
But how much of that is Hollywood? How truly real is the danger, especially 
to a MacBook owner like yourself? And how can you protect yourself? The 
good news is that you can easily secure your data from all but the most 
determined hacker — in fact, depending on the hardware that you’re using 
to connect to the Internet, you might be well guarded right now without 
even knowing it.
In this chapter, I continue a quest that I’ve pursued for over a decade now — 
to make my readers feel comfortable and secure in the online world by 
explaining the truth about what can happen and telling you how you can 
protect your system from intrusions.
 
One quick note: This chapter is written with the home and small business 
MacBook owner in mind. Macs that access the Internet through a larger 
corporate network are very likely already protected by that knight in 
shining armor, the network system administrator. (Insert applause here.) Of 
course, if you’re using Mac OS X in your office, you’re still welcome to read 
and follow this material. Check with your system administrator, however, 
before you attempt to implement any of the recommendations that I make.
What Can Really Happen?
Before I begin, I want to offer you a moment of reassurance and a little of 
my personal background to explain that I’m well qualified to be your guide 
through this online minefield. (After all, you don’t want Jerry Lewis lecturing 
you on how to maintain your Internet security. He’s a funny guy, though, 
convenez-vous?)

558
What Can Really Happen?
 
✦ I’ve been running and managing all sorts of online systems since the 
days of the BBS (Bulletin Board System), the text-based dinosaurs that 
used to rule the online world in the early ’80s to early ’90s. (In fact, my 
first book was on this very subject — and it contained a chapter on 
viruses long before they were the darlings of the techno-media.)
 
✦ As a consultant, I run Web sites and squash virus attacks for a number 
of companies and organizations.
 
✦ I run a popular Internet radio station that serves up ’70s hits in 
CD-quality to anyone with a high-speed DSL or cable Internet connection 
and a copy of iTunes. (More on this broadcasting revolution in Book IV, 
Chapter 2.)
 
✦ I keep my own office network of six computers safe from attack while 
still providing readers all over the world with Web sites and the 
aforementioned radio station and BBS.
With that understood, here’s what can happen to you online without the 
right safeguards, on any computer:
 
✦ Hackers can access shared information on your network. If you’re 
running an unguarded network, others can gain access to your 
documents and applications or wreak havoc on your system.
 
✦ Your system could be infected with a virus or dangerous macro. 
Left to their own devices, these misbehaving programs and macro 
commands can delete files or turn your entire hard drive into an empty 
paperweight. (Although Mac viruses are very rare as I write this, I 
don’t think we’ll enjoy such luxury for long. Plus, if you dual-boot your 
MacBook into Windows XP or Windows Vista, you’ve suddenly entered 
a veritable minefield of PC viruses and spyware. More on this in a page 
or two.)
 
✦ Unsavory individuals could attempt to contact members of your 
family. This kind of attack may take place through iChat, e-mail, or Web 
discussion boards, putting your family’s safety at risk.
 
✦ Hackers can use your system to attack others. Your laptop can be 
tricked into helping hackers when they attempt to knock out Web 
servers and public access File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the 
Internet. Along the same lines, that innocent Web server you put online 
can be misused by spam-spewing, online “entrepreneurs.” (Cute name, 
right?)
 
✦ Criminals can attempt to con you out of your credit card or personal 
information. The Internet is a prime tool used by those trying to steal 
identities.

What Can Really Happen?
To be absolutely honest, some danger is indeed present every time you or 
any user of your MacBook connects to the Internet. However, here’s the 
good news. With the right safeguards, it’s literally impossible for most of 
those worst-case scenarios to happen on your MacBook, and what remains 
would be so difficult that even the most die-hard hacker would throw in the 
towel long before reaching your computer or network.
Using a Macintosh gives you an advantage: Hackers and virus developers 
(there’s a career for you) are traditionally interested only in “having fun” 
with PCs running Windows, so the likelihood that Snow Leopard could pick 
up a virus is far, far less than it would be if you were using Windows XP or 
Vista. As I mention earlier, if you boot into Windows using Snow Leopard’s 
dual-boot feature on your MacBook, you need to pay heed to Windows XP or 
Vista security.
 
Because this is a book that focuses on Mac OS X Snow Leopard, I don’t 
spend much time covering Windows. If you’d like a comprehensive guide to 
Windows XP, Windows Vista, and the PC world, however, I can heartily 
recommend the sister volume to this book, PCs All-in-One Desk Reference 
For Dummies, Fourth Edition, published by Wiley. Why the strong 
recommendation? Well, I wrote that book as well!
Evidently, Apple just doesn’t have the numbers to attract the attention of the 
Bad Guys yet . . . yet another reason to enjoy the exclusive nature of the Mac 
universe (and its UNIX foundation)! (Heck, I even know a couple of fellow 
Mac owners who feel they just don’t need antivirus protection — but believe 
me, this is not an area where you want to be lax and lazy, and you still need 
an antivirus application! More on antivirus software later in this chapter.)
If it smells phishy . . .
Ever heard of the word phishing? Con artists 
and hackers create Web sites that look just 
like major online stores — including big names 
such as eBay, PayPal, and Amazon. These 
turkeys then send out junk e-mail messages 
that tell you that you must log on to this Web site 
to refresh or correct your personal information. 
As you’ve no doubt already guessed, that 
information is siphoned off and sold to the highest 
bidder. Your credit card, your password, and 
your address. Luckily, if you follow the tips that I 
give later in this chapter in the section “A Dose 
of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online,” 
you’ll avoid these phishing expeditions!

560
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
I also want to point out that virtually everyone reading this book — as well 
as the guy writing it — really doesn’t have anything that’s worth a malicious 
hacking campaign. Things like Quicken data files, saved games of Sims 2, 
and genealogical data might be priceless to us, of course, but most dedicated 
hackers are after bigger game. Unfortunately, the coverage that the media 
and Hollywood give to corporate and government attacks can turn even 
Aunt Harriet more than a little paranoid. Therefore, time for another of 
Mark’s Maxims:
 
It’s not really necessary to consider the FBI or Interpol each time you poke 
your MacBook’s power button. A few simple precautions are all that’s 
required.
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
“Okay, Mark, now I know the real story on what can happen to my computer 
online. So what do I do to safeguard my MacBook?” You need but two 
essential tools to protect your hardware (besides a healthy amount of 
common sense, which I cover in the upcoming section “A Dose of Common 
Sense: Things Not to Do Online”): a firewall and an antivirus program.
The term hacker dates far back in the annals of 
the personal computer — in fact, it originally 
had nothing to do with networks, the Internet, 
or illegal activities at all . . . because In The 
Beginning, there was no public Internet!
“Explain yourself, Chambers!” All right. The 
original hackers were electronics buffs, ham 
radio operators, computer hobbyists, and 
engineers who built (or hacked) a working 
computer out of individual components with 
a soldering gun and a whole lotta guts. At the 
time, you didn’t simply order a computer from 
Dell or visit your local Maze o’ Wires store in 
the mall to select your favorite system.
No, I’m talking about the mid-’70s, in the 
halcyon time before IBM even introduced 
the IBM PC (and when the only folks using the 
Internet, which wasn’t called that back then, 
were military folks and researchers). Even the 
simplest computer — really nothing more than 
a glorified calculator by today’s standards — 
had to be lovingly assembled by hand. These 
early personal computers didn’t run software 
as we know it. Instead, you programmed them 
manually through a bank of switches on the 
front, and they responded with codes displayed 
on a bank of lights. (Think about that the next 
time you launch Microsoft Word 2008.)
Today, of course, the need to assemble a 
computer from individual transistors is 
nonexistent, and the word hacker has an 
entirely different connotation — but don’t be 
surprised if you meet an older member of your 
Macintosh user’s group who’s proud to be an 
old-fashioned hacker! (Look for the soldering 
gun, usually worn in a holster like a sidearm.)

Firewall basics
First, a definition: a firewall is a piece of hardware or software that essentially 
builds an impermeable barrier between the computers on your side of the 
wall (meaning your MacBook and any other computers on your network) 
and all external computers on the other side of the wall (meaning the rest of 
the Internet).
“But wait a second — if other computers can’t reach me and my MacBook 
can’t reach them, how can I use the Internet at all?” Ah, that’s the beauty 
of today’s firewalls. By using a series of techniques designed to thwart 
attacks from the outside, a firewall allows you to communicate safely, even 
monitoring what you send and what you receive for later examination. 
Figure 6-1 illustrates the basics of a firewall.

(can be

or both)
A firewall sounds grand and incredibly complex and highly technical — and 
sometimes it is — but it can also be quite simple. For example:
 
✦ You can spend anywhere from $50 to thousands of dollars installing 
sophisticated firewall hardware and/or software.
 
 or
 
✦ You can activate your firewall by disconnecting your dialup, digital 
subscriber line (DSL), or cable modem from the wall socket.
Believe it or not, both of those examples technically involve a firewall. In the 
first case, the firewall is a physical, tangible presence on the network; in 
the second case, the lack of a connection to the Internet actually acts as a 

562
“Shields Up, Chekov!”
firewall. (Think of it as the Air Firewall . . . no relation to the MacBook Air.) 
I’ve spoken to a number of readers who actually do this; however, if you’re 
running a Web site or downloading a file from your company’s FTP site, 
yanking the connection when you head to bed isn’t an option. Therefore, 
most of us will install a physical firewall through hardware or software.
Do I already have a firewall?
In some cases, you might already be using a hardware firewall and not even 
know it. For example, many Internet-sharing devices include a built-in NAT 
firewall. NAT stands for Network Address Translation, and it’s the most 
effective and popular hardware firewall standard in use by consumer 
devices. If you’re using an Internet sharing hub or router, check its manual 
to determine whether it offers NAT as a firewall feature — and if so, turn 
it on if NAT isn’t enabled by default. (See Book VII, Chapter 2 for more on 
Internet sharing, routers, and firewalls.)
For instance, Figure 6-2 illustrates the configuration screen for my Internet 
router. Note the options to disable port scanning and ping responses, which 
are two tricks that hackers often use to detect what’s often called a hot 
computer — meaning that the computer can be identified and is accessible 
to attack. (Wireless networks are notoriously hot — for more information on 
securing your wireless connections, visit Book VII, Chapter 4.)
Using the internal Mac OS X firewall
Mac OS X includes a powerful internal firewall, which Snow Leopard makes 
very simple to use! Most MacBook owners will be perfectly satisfied with 
this built-in firewall, which is configured through System Preferences — find 
more information on setting up your firewall in Book VI, Chapter 2.
Using a commercial software firewall
You’ll also find a number of popular alternatives to Snow Leopard’s built-in 
firewall on the market, many of which offer more control over individual 
applications and more configuration options than your Mac OS X firewall. 
For example, consider Intego’s NetBarrier X5 (www.intego.com), which 
comes with a number of preset configurations that allow you to choose a 
basic firewall for your network environment with a single click.
 
Whether you set up the internal firewall, a shareware firewall, or a 
commercial firewall, visit a favorite site of mine on the Web: www.grc.com, 
the home of Gibson Research Corporation. There you’ll find the free online 
utility ShieldsUP!!, which will automatically test just how tight your firewall 
is and how susceptible your Mac could be to hacker attacks. Visit this site 
often because this service is updated periodically to reflect new hacking 
techniques.

Antivirus basics
Next, consider your antivirus protection (both under Snow Leopard and 
Windows XP/Vista, if you’re running Boot Camp on your MacBook). Viruses 
are typically transmitted through applications — you run a program, and 
the virus is activated. (Although not the traditional definition of a virus, both 
scripts and macros can be used to take control of your system and cause 
trouble, as well.) Therefore, you need to closely monitor what I call The Big 
Three:
 
✦ Web downloads: Consider every file that you receive from the Internet 
as a possible viral threat.
 
✦ Removable media: Viruses can be stored on everything from CD-ROMs 
and DVD-ROMs to USB flash drives.
 
✦ E-mail file attachments: A “Trojan Horse” or “worm” application sent to 
you as an e-mail attachment is an easy doorway to your system.

564
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
Horrors! Mac OS X has no built-in antivirus support. (Then again, neither 
does Windows.) However, a good antivirus program will take care of any 
application that’s carrying a virus. Some even handle destructive macros 
within documents. Make sure that the antivirus program you choose offers 
real-time scanning, which operates when you download or open a file. 
Periodic scanning of your entire system is important, too, but only a real-time 
scanning application such as Norton AntiVirus can immediately ensure that 
the documents or the application you just received in your e-mail Inbox is 
actually free from viruses. (Oh, and don’t forget that many of the Software 
Updates released by Apple for Snow Leopard will plug security holes in our 
favorite operating system.)
 
Virus technology continues to evolve over time, just as more beneficial 
application development does. For example, recently a virus was discovered 
that’s actually contained in a JPEG image file! With a good antivirus 
application that offers regular updates, you’ll continue to keep your system 
safe from viral attack.
I heartily recommend both Norton AntiVirus from Symantec (available 
in versions for Snow Leopard and Windows) and Intego’s VirusBarrier 
X5 (available for Snow Leopard only). Both programs include automatic 
updates delivered while you’re online to make sure that you’re covered 
against the latest viruses.
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
One more powerful weapon that you can use to make sure that your 
MacBook stays safe from unlawful intrusion is this: Practicing common 
sense on the Internet is just as important as adding a firewall and an 
antivirus application to your laptop.
With this in mind, here’s a checklist of things that you should never do while 
you’re online:
 
✦ Never download a file from a site you don’t trust. And make sure that 
your antivirus software is configured to check downloaded files before 
you open them.
 
✦ Never open an e-mail attachment until it has been checked. Don’t give 
in to temptation, even if the person who sent the message is someone 
you trust. (Many of today’s macro viruses actually replicate themselves 
by sending copies to the addresses found through the victim’s e-mail 
program. Of course, this problem crops up regularly in the Windows 
world, but it’s been known to happen in the Macintosh community as 
well.)

Book VI
Chapter 6

Online
565
A Dose of Common Sense: Things Not to Do Online
 
✦ Never enter any personal information in an e-mail message unless 
you know the recipient. Sure, I send my mailing address to friends and 
family, but no one else. In fact, even e-mail can be intercepted by a 
determined hacker, so if you’re sending something truly important, 
use an encryption application, such as PGP Personal Desktop (www.
pgp.com).
 
✦ Never enter any personal information on a Web site provided as a 
link in an e-mail message. Don’t fall prey to phishing expeditions. Some 
of these e-mail-message/Web-site combinations look authentic enough 
to fool anyone! No reputable online company or store will demand or 
solicit your personal information through e-mail or through a linked 
Web site. In fact, feel free to contact the company through its real Web 
site and report the phishing attempt!
 
✦ Never include any personal information in an Internet newsgroup 
post. (In case you’re not familiar with the term, newsgroups are public 
Internet message bases, often called Usenet groups. Some ISPs offer a 
selection of newsgroups that you can access.) Newsgroup posts can be 
viewed by anyone, so there’s no such thing as privacy in a newsgroup. 
(For a glimpse of just how long one of these posts can linger in the great 
Internet continuum, visit www.google.com, click the Groups button, 
and search for your name. I can pull up newsgroup messages that I 
posted back in 1995!)
 
✦ Never buy from an online store that doesn’t offer a secure, encrypted 
connection when you’re prompted for your personal information and 
credit card number. If you’re using Apple’s Safari browser, the padlock 
icon appears next to the site name in the title bar. When the padlock 
icon appears in the title bar, the connection is encrypted and secure.
 
✦ Never divulge personal information to others over an iChat connection.
 
✦ Never use the same password for all your electronic business. Use 
different passwords that include both letters and numbers, change them 
often, and never divulge them to anyone else.
 
✦ Never give anyone else administrative access to your Web server.
 
✦ Never allow any type of remote access (such as sharing screens) to 
your MacBook or your network without testing that access first. It’s 
very important to restrict remote access to visitors whom you trust.
Find more details on securing your network from intrusion — including 
Internet hacker attacks — in Book VII. I cover System Preferences that can 
affect the security of your system in Book III.

Chapter 1: Setting Up 
a Small Network
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out what a network is and why you might want one
✓ Setting up the network hardware
✓ Configuring network system preferences
✓ Troubleshooting your network
I
n the not-so-distant past — I’m talking 15–20 years ago — networks were 
found only in huge companies that had the money and the workforce to 
pay for and maintain them. But now, as technology rolls on, a home or small 
office network is both very affordable and relatively easy to create. In this 
chapter, I introduce you to this helpful beastie: You discover what networks 
are, what you can do with them, and how to set up a small network of your 
own for your home or small business.
Networks can be used for many things. Computers exchange all types of 
data over a network: files that you want to send between computers or to 
networked printers, streaming audio or video broadcasts, data for 
multiplayer computer games, or even a private company Web site (typically 
called an intranet). Anything that you can imagine that would involve 
moving data between multiple computers can be done by using a network.
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
First, let me define network. In a nutshell, a network is a combination of 
hardware, cables, and software that allows computers and printers to talk 
to each other. (Heck, you don’t even need cables with a wireless network, 
as I show you in Chapter 3 of this minibook.) To have a network, you need 
the right hardware and software — and did I mention that all the hardware 
and software that you need probably came with your MacBook? (Except for 
those pesky cables, of course.) As you progress through this chapter, you’ll 
discover everything that’s required to set up your network so that you 
can pick up any additional parts you need. Any good-sized computer store 
(either the brick-and-mortar or online variety) has everything that you need 
to get up and running.

570
What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
Now, back to the requirements: You need the right hardware and software 
to make your network sing. This section covers each component with a 
description about the role that each part plays on the network and other 
good stuff you’ll want to know to get your network right the first time.
Something to network
Okay, this might be obvious, but I’m nothing if not thorough. The first thing 
that you need to build a network is . . . well, stuff! That’s right, you need to 
have devices that you want to network. Most times, these are computers 
(whether Macs or PCs running Windows/Linux/UNIX), printers, personal 
digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and other standalone, network-capable 
devices (such as file servers and shared tape back-up drives).
Network interface card (NIC)
A network interface card, or NIC, is a hardware device that your computer 
uses to talk to the rest of the network. The NIC connects to the network 
cabling, and it speaks the language of electronics, sending data around the 
network. Nowadays, most networks use the Ethernet networking protocol, 
and most NICs are Ethernet compatible. All MacBooks have some type of 
Ethernet NIC hardware built right onto the Mac’s main system board. (Note, 
however, that the MacBook Air offers only wireless hardware built in; you 
can add a wired Ethernet port to the MacBook Air using an external USB 
connector.)
Switch
So you have an assortment of devices in your home or small office that 
you’ve decided to network. How do you make them all interconnect? 
Although you could connect just two computers by using nothing more than 
a single crossover cable, you need fancier hardware to connect more than 
two computers: namely, a switch. The switch is used to connect everything, 
so it’s the focal point of the network. Without a switch, you don’t have a 
network.
A switch is really just a small box that has a bunch of Ethernet ports on it. 
A port is really just like an Ethernet NIC on your computer, but a switch has 
lots of them. Inside, all those Ethernet ports are arranged so that the talking 
(sending) wires from each port connect to the listening (receiving) wires on 
all other ports. Therefore, when one computer talks, all others listen.

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
Setting up a switch (and therefore giving birth to your network, which 
sounds more painful than it is) is usually no more difficult than connecting a 
power cable to the device and then plugging in your computers with their 
own Ethernet cables. You’ll see various lights on the box — usually a power 
light indicating that the switch is powered on and operational. You’ll also 
see lights that correspond to each port on the switch; these lights tell you 
what’s going on in the box. For instance, you normally see the following 
types of lights:
 
✦ Link light: Each port on a switch should have a link light. Link lights 
simply tell you which ports have something alive connected to a given 
port — that is, a device is connected and powered on.
Wired Ethernet standards allow for opera-
tion at different speeds. Because the Ethernet 
standard has improved over time, some 
older Ethernet devices support only the older 
(slower) speeds. Ethernet’s speed is rated by 
how much data it can transfer in a second — 
usually in millions of bits per second, or mega-
bits per second (Mbps). Originally, Ethernet 
was designed to run at 10 Mbps. Now there 
are different speeds of Ethernet: 10 Mbps, 100 
Mbps, 1000 Mbps, and even faster.
The 1000 Mbps Ethernet — also called Gigabit 
Ethernet or just Gigabit for short — is still a bit 
on the expensive side for small home or office 
networks. All consumer-level Gigabit Ethernet 
NICs also support running at 10 Mbps or 100 
Mbps, so you will hear them called 10/100/1000 
Ethernet NICs. All current MacBook models 
come with a 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC built 
in — except the MacBook Air, which has 
integrated wireless Ethernet hardware instead. 
(Apple offers a USB-to-Ethernet converter for 
those MacBook Air owners that need a wired 
connection, but the connection is significantly 
slower.)
Although Gigabit NICs are now priced under 
$50, most of the devices that can connect 
Gigabit NICs still cost significantly more than 
their 10/100 counterparts. That fact, coupled 
with the reality that most computer systems 
can’t really even handle or dish out that much 
data, makes Gigabit Ethernet a choice only for 
those wanting a high-end network with the 
best performance.
NICs and other Ethernet equipment that handle 
only 10 Mbps are rapidly becoming obsolete 
because virtually all the modern NICs and other 
Ethernet hardware support both 10 Mbps and 
100 Mbps. Most times, you’ll see this labeled as 
10/100 Ethernet. For your home networking, you 
probably want to invest in 10/100 Mbps.
Thirty-nine flavors of Ethernet . . . 
but no Rocky Road

What Do I Need to Set Up My Network?
 
✦ Speed light: Each port on the switch should have a speed light, which 
tells you the speed of the device at the other end. Some switches have 
different lights for different speeds, and some use a single light and 
make it different colors for different speeds.
 
✦ Activity light: When one computer speaks, they all hear it. Typically, 
an entire switch has only one activity light for the entire network, 
indicating that someone is speaking. With heavy traffic, the light can 
appear solid.
 
Bear with me whilst I spew techno-talk for a paragraph or two. When an 
Ethernet switch receives a frame — that’s the name for a standard unit, or 
packet, of network data — it reads the label on the frame to see the return 
address of the computer that sent the frame. In a short amount of time 
(after being turned on and watching the data move around), a switch figures 
out which computer is located on which port. Then, whenever data comes 
into the switch, it looks at the header (some information on the front of 
all frames, much like a mailing label on a package that you send) and sees 
which computer should receive the frame. The switch then sends the frame 
out the port for that computer only.
This is A Good Thing. Instead of forcing all computers on the network to 
listen while your MacBook speaks (as antique network hubs did) — known 
as half-duplex — a switch sends the data directly to the only computer that 
needs to hear it.
Cables
Cables are the ties that bind . . . literally. Cables are used to connect the 
Ethernet port on each computer to the switch, the central hardware of the 
network. With a little experience, you’ll be a cable-wielding superhero with 
hundreds of feet of cable draped across every piece of furniture in your 
place for your first LAN party. (A LAN party, by the way, is when way too 
many techies bring their computers into a very small space, connect them, 
and play games for 48 hours straight. Oh, and we eat a lot, too. Good stuff!)
Here’s the scoop on what kind of cables to use. Technically, you can run 100 
Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable (like a super-version of the wire that you use 
for your telephones).
 
Although you can do 10/100 Mbps Ethernet over Cat5 cable, any new cables 
that you buy should be Cat5E or Cat6 — which I talk about in the following 
section — because these types of cables are specifically meant for use with 
1000 Mbps (or Gigabit) Ethernet. I’m sure you noticed that the common 
denominator here is the Cat5 cable. That’s because fiber optic cable, 
although supporting speeds of 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, and even 10 Gbps, is much 
more expensive and more difficult to install.

Book VII
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small

573
Setting Up Your Network
Hey, did I mention that you can eschew cables entirely? For more information 
on the lean, mean world of wireless networking, see Chapter 3 of this 
minibook.
 
Be sure to buy straight-through Cat5E/Cat6 cables (also called patch cables) 
and not crossover cables, which are used only in certain circumstances. 
Crossover cables are mainly used to connect two computers directly (to 
form a tiny, two-computer network), connect a cable/DSL modem directly to 
a computer, or connect multiple switches.
 
Cat5 cable supports speeds of 100 Mbps. 1000 Mbps Ethernet, of course, is 
designed to run ten times faster than that; luckily enough, it was engineered 
to be compatible with 90 percent of Cat5 installations. Having said that, I 
must also point out that some Cat5 cables don’t stick to the stringent 
specifications that 1000 Mbps Ethernet requires. The newer version of Cat5 
cable is Category 5 Enhanced, or Cat5E for short. Cat5E is recommended for 
any new installation because it can easily handle 10/100 Mbps Ethernet and 
yet can handle 1000 Mbps Ethernet as well. Even if you’re using 10/100 Mbps 
Ethernet, you can upgrade someday to 1000 Mbps without having to worry 
about upgrading your cabling. You may also find Cat6 cabling in your 
network travels, which can also easily handle 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds.
Setting Up Your Network
After you collect the hardware components I list earlier in this chapter, 
you’re ready to connect things. Here’s a quick list of things to do to get your 
network fired up:
 
1. Find the best location for placing your switch.
 
 To keep costs down, try to place the switch in a location close to a 
power outlet that’s centrally located so that you can use the least 
amount of cable. If cost isn’t an issue, hide the unit in a closet and just 
run all the cables along the walls to the hub or switch. And if cost really 
isn’t an issue, get your house fully wired with Cat5E cable.
 
2. Plug the switch into the power socket.
 
 Some switches come on automatically when you plug them in and can 
never be turned off. Others have a power switch that you need to turn 
on the first time that you plug them in.
 
3. Verify that the switch is working by looking at the lights on the 
front. Check the manual that came with the switch to see what light 
configuration is normal for that particular unit.

574
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
 
 Until you have computers or printers attached to it, you might just have 
a status light that shows the switch is powered on. But if the lights on 
your unit don’t match up with what the manual says, you could have a 
bum unit that you need to return.
 
4. Verify that all your devices are near enough to the switch to be 
connected by your cables; then, turn them all on.
 
5. Get one of your Cat5E or Cat6 cables and connect one cable from the 
Ethernet jack on your MacBook (on the side) to an open port on the 
switch.
 
 You should see a link light or speed light come on that verifies that the 
two devices sense each other.
 
6. Repeat Step 5 until each device is attached to the switch.
Congratulations, you’re a network technician! (Don’t forget to call your 
friends and brag.) The first phase of the network, the physical connection, is 
complete; the next step is the configuration of Mac OS X.
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
Take a deep breath; there’s no need to panic — in fact, configuring your 
network software basically involves entering a lot of numbers and other stuff 
in dialogs. (In fact, most folks can just allow Snow Leopard to take care of 
network settings automatically.) But just so you understand what’s involved, 
this section explains what those numbers are, what they do, and why you 
ought to know it. Because this is a MacBook book, I stick with configuring 
Macs running the Big X.
TCP/IP
First things first: Protocol is just the techno-nerd word for a set of rules or 
a language. A protocol is a language that computers use to communicate. 
Without protocols, the computers on your network would never be able 
to speak to each other even though you have NICs, cables, and a hub or a 
switch. The Internet Protocol (IP) part of the TCP/IP suite is what you’re 
really interested in because it’s the most important part of your network 
configuration chore.
IP addresses
IP addresses are like street addresses for computers on a network. Each 
computer on the network has an IP address, and it needs to be unique 
because no other computer can share it. When a computer wants to 
communicate with another computer, it can simply send the data on the 
network in a nice package that has its address as well as the address of 
the computer that it’s trying to talk to. (Remember frames? If not, take a 
refresher in the earlier section “Switch.”)

Book VII
Chapter 1
Setting Up a Small 
Network
575
Understanding the Basics of Network Configuration
An IP address is just a number, but it’s written in a strange way. (Go figure.) 
All IP addresses are written as four sets of numerals between 0 and 255 with 
a dot (period) between each set. For instance, a common IP address that 
you might run into is 192.168.0.1. As everyone knows, engineers can’t sleep 
unless they have three or four ways to write the same thing, including IP 
addresses. The form shown above — which is by far the most common — is 
dotted notation. Each number, such as 192, is an octet.
 
Don’t worry too much about this stuff: You don’t have to remember terms 
like octet to create your own network. They could be helpful, however, if 
something goes wrong and you need to place a call to tech support. Plus, 
you can impress the computer salesperson (gleefully called a wonk by 
Mac power users) at your local Maze ’o Wires store with your mastery of 
techno-babble.
IP addresses at home versus on the Internet
One very important thing to keep in mind is that the Almighty IP Address 
Police — Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (www.iana.org) — has 
broken IP addresses into groups. The two main types of IP addresses are 
public and private:
 
✦ Public IP addresses can be used on the Internet and are unique 
throughout the whole world.
 
✦ Private IP addresses are used in homes or businesses and can’t be used 
to talk to the public Internet. Private IP addresses are used over and 
over by many people and most commonly take the form 192.168.x.x. 
(AirPort Extreme base stations use private IP addresses in the form 
10.0.x.x.)
You’ll almost always get a public IP address from your Internet service 
provider (ISP), whether you’re using a cable modem, digital subscriber line 
(DSL), or a regular dial-up modem. If you use a cable/DSL router or Snow 
Leopard’s built-in sharing software to share your Internet connection among 
multiple computers, you’ll be using private IP addresses on your network 
while using a single public IP address to talk to the Internet. (More on that in 
Chapter 4 of this minibook.)
“Great! I get an IP address, put it into my Network settings in System 
Preferences, and off I go. Right?” Well, you’re close, but here are a few other 
pieces of information that you might need before you can go surfing around 
the world:
 
✦ Default gateway: When you send information to other networks — 
whether in another building or around the world on the Internet — your 
computer needs to know the IP address of the gateway that will forward 
your data down the line. The default gateway is really just the IP address 
of a router, which is a device that connects multiple networks. A gateway 
gets its name because it really is your gateway to all other networks.

576
Configuring Network System Preferences
 
✦ Subnet mask: A subnet mask is a number that helps your computer 
know when it needs to send stuff through the router. It’s a group of four 
octets with dots, just like an IP address, but almost always uses 0 or 255 
for each of the four octets. Most often, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0. 
If the wrong number is entered for the subnet mask, it could keep you 
from talking to the Internet or even to computers on your own network.
Software applications
After you have the hardware in place and you’ve chosen and configured a 
protocol to allow the computers to all talk to each other, you need software 
to make use of your new network connections. Time for more good news: A 
lot of the software that you need to move data on your network is included 
already in Mac OS X! Here are brief descriptions of some of the network 
software and protocols already built into Mac OS X and what they’re used for:
 
✦ FTP: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, 
allows computers of any type — Mac, PC, Linux, UNIX, mainframe, or 
whatever — to transfer files back and forth.
 
✦ Telnet: Telnet is also part of the TCP/IP suite — you can use it to 
remotely connect to a computer and execute commands on the remote 
machine.
 
✦ Samba: Samba (or SMB) is an open source software suite that enables 
Mac OS X users to share files with people using Windows computers and 
allows the Mac users to connect to files that the Windows computers 
share.
 
✦ HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), also part of the TCP/IP suite, 
is used by Web browsers to provide access to all the various pages on 
the World Wide Web.
Configuring Network System Preferences
In this section, I show you how to configure your MacBook to communicate 
with other computers on a local network.
Leave it to Snow Leopard to provide you with assistance — in this case, 
when you first open the Network pane, you might be greeted with a dialog 
offering you assistance on setting up the stuff I cover in this section. (Whether 
you get this absolutely free offer of aid depends on whether you upgraded 
your MacBook from a previous version of Mac OS X or entered your network 
and Internet settings within the Snow Leopard Setup Assistant.) If you do 
decide to allow the Snow Leopard Internet/Network assistant to guide you 
through your network setup, I’ll meet back up with you at the next section.

Using DHCP for automatic IP address assignment
Now I’d like to introduce you to a very dear friend of mine — an abbreviation 
that you will soon grow to love, as does everyone else who’s set up a small 
Mac network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, or DHCP for short, is a 
protocol that enables a computer to automatically get all the information 
that I’ve talked about to this point. (Check in your Webster’s . . . this is the 
very definition of the word godsend.)
You’re saying, “Mark, there’s gotta be a catch, right?” Well, here’s the bad 
news: Before you can use DHCP, you have to add a DHCP server, which 
provides other computers on the network with their configuration settings. 
Here’s the good news: Most Internet connection-sharing hardware devices 
(and software-sharing implementations as well) provide a DHCP server as 
part of the price of admission. (Internet connection sharing allows all your 
networked computers to access the Internet through a single Internet 
connection. I cover it more in Chapter 4 of this minibook.) Most wired 
and wireless routers can provide DHCP services these days. Technology 
marches on.
If you plan to use Internet connection sharing or you know that you 
have a DHCP server on your network, you can set up your MacBook to 
automatically obtain the required IP address and information. Open System 
Preferences from the Dock or the Apple menu and choose Network. From 
the Network dialog that appears, click the Ethernet entry in the list on the 
left. Choose Using DHCP from the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu; then click 
the Apply Now button. Mac OS X contacts the DHCP server to obtain an IP 
address, a subnet mask, a gateway router IP address, and a Domain Name 
System (DNS) address. (DNS servers convert a human-friendly address, like 
www.yahoo.com, to a computer-friendly IP address, like 66.218.71.86.)
A few seconds after clicking the Apply Now button, you should see the 
information come up, as provided by the DHCP server. This lets you know 
that the process worked and configuration is complete. You might also 
notice that the DNS Servers information is empty. Fear not: Mac OS X is 
really using DNS information provided by the DHCP server. Press Ô+Q to 
quit System Preferences and save your settings.
 
If you ever make a network change that screws things up, such as entering the 
wrong subnet mask or an IP address that isn’t in the same range as others on 
your LAN, you can always click the Revert button to get back your old settings.
 
One DHCP server on a network is princely, but two or more DHCP servers 
on a single network will fight like alley cats and grind everything to a halt. 
Therefore, if you’re considering adding a DHCP server to an existing network, 
make doggone sure that you’re not treading on another server’s toes. (Ask 
that network administrator person.)

578
Configuring Network System Preferences
Manually choosing an IP address range
You say you don’t have a DHCP server, and you need to manually assign IP 
addresses? This configuration also means you need to manually configure 
the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties. 
Keep in mind that for now, you’re not concerned with the Internet — just 
computers on the local network.
A result of being on a local network — because it’s not connected to 
the Internet, it’s also called a private network — is that you must use IP 
addresses that are reserved for private network use. You can use a few 
different ranges of IP addresses, but I recommend that you choose an 
address range from the 192.168.x.x (or 10.0.x.x) networks. In the next 
section, I show you how.
Down to business: I recommend that you use IP addresses in the 192.168.x.x 
range (or the 10.0.x.x range if you’re using an AirPort Extreme base station). 
What does this mean, exactly? Well, here’s the scoop:
 
✦ Use IP addresses where the first two octets are 192 and 168 (192.168) 
or 10 and 0 for AirPort Extreme (10.0).
 
 Octet numbers are conjoined by periods.
 
✦ For the third octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
 
 It doesn’t matter which one you choose as long as you use this same 
third number on all computers on your network.
 
✦ For the fourth octet, select any number between 1 and 254.
 
 Make sure that every computer on your local network has a different 
fourth octet number. This is very important; otherwise, your network 
doesn’t work.
 
✦ Use 255.255.255.0 as your subnet mask.
For instance, suppose that you’re using three computers on your network. 
All the IP addresses that you use will start with 192.168. Next, suppose you 
choose 123 for the third octet. (Remember that you can choose any number 
between 1 and 254.) Finally, for the fourth octet, choose the numbers 100, 
105, and 110 for the three computers, respectively. (Again, you can choose 
any numbers between 1 and 254.) The resulting IP addresses used on the 
three computers are
192.168.123.100
192.168.123.105
192.168.123.110

Book VII
Chapter 1

Configuring Network System Preferences
 
By the way, I should mention that there are other range possibilities for 
reserved private networks — AirPort and AirPort Extreme hardware uses a 
10.x.x.x network range, for example — but the 192.168.x.x range is definitely 
the most popular and the most common default on Ethernet network hardware.
After you know the IP addresses and the subnet mask that you’re going to 
use, start setting up each computer. Being a nice guy, I walk you through 
the process of configuring Mac OS X with the 192.168.123.105 address as an 
example.
Be sure that you have all the physical portions of your network powered up 
and connected as I outline in the earlier section, “Setting Up Your Network.”
 
1. Select any of your Macs to start with and open System Preferences 
(either from the Apple menu or from the Dock).
 
2. From the System Preferences dialog, choose Network.
 
 The Network pane appears.
 
3. Click Ethernet in the list.
 
4. Click the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu and choose Manually.
 
 Figure 1-1 shows how things should look.

example) in the IP Address text box.

6. Enter the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask text box.
 
7. If you’re using a router or hardware Internet sharing device, enter the 
IP address used by the router in the Router text box.
 
8. Click the Apply button, and your new network settings take effect.
 
9. Press Ô+Q to quit System Preferences.
Repeat this same procedure with the other IP addresses for each of the 
other Macs that are connected to your network.
 
Most ISPs also supply DNS server addresses and search domains. If your ISP 
included DNS server addresses or search domains, don’t forget to type them 
into the corresponding boxes on the TCP/IP panel.
Verifying Connectivity
After you have your Macs connected and your TCP/IP configuration is done, 
check to make sure that everything is working. After you have at least two 
computers on your network, each with a TCP/IP address, you can use a 
simple little utility called ping to test the connection.
ping is a very simple, yet extremely helpful, utility that’s the first connectivity-
testing tool out of the box, even for network professionals. When you use 
the ping utility — referred to as pinging something — the application sends 
out a small packet of data to whatever destination you’re trying to reach. 
When the receiving computer hears the ping, it answers with a ping reply. If 
the original computer receives the ping reply, you know that the connection 
between the computers is good.
To ping a computer, you use a little application built in to Mac OS X called 
Network Utility, which allows you to work various network wonders (including 
checking connectivity, watching the route that your computer takes to get 
to another computer, and looking up information about Internet domain 
names). To use Network Utility to check network connectivity, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open a Finder window, click Applications, and click Utilities.
 
2. Double-click the Network Utility icon to launch the application.
 
3. Click the Ping tab (see Figure 1-2).
 
4. In the Enter the Network Address to Ping text field, enter the IP 
address of the computer that you want to ping.
 
5. To simply verify connectivity, select the Send Only x Pings radio 
button and enter a low number, such as 5, in the text field.
 
 Five or ten pings are plenty to see whether the connection is good.

6. Click the Ping button.
 
 Your Mac sends ping packets to the IP address that you entered.
 
Figure 1-2: 
Preparing to 
ping. (Can 
you say 
that with 
a straight 
face?)
 
 
If the pings are successful, text appears in the text box at the bottom of the 
Ping tab: one line for each ping reply received from the other computer. The 
end of each line reads time= with a number at the end. That number is the 
amount of time, in 1⁄1000 of a second (milliseconds [ms]), that it took for the 
ping packet to go from your computer to the other computer and back.
If your ping is unsuccessful, you see nothing, at least for a little bit. Each 
ping that you send takes two seconds before it’s considered missing in 
action. So, if you choose five pings, wait ten seconds before you see the 
results. After all the pings time out — a ping times out when it doesn’t get 
returned in the proper amount of time — you see a line of text appear that 
reads ping: sendto: No route to host or 100% packet loss. Both 
error messages mean the same thing: All the ping packets that you sent out 
are now in the packet graveyard, never to be seen again. As you’ve likely 
guessed already, this is not a good sign for your network connectivity. Look 
to the following section, “Troubleshooting Your New Network,” to find out 
where to begin troubleshooting this problem.
 
If you can ping all the other computers on your network from one of the 
computers, you don’t need to go to each computer and ping all the others. 
You can logically assume that all the computers can communicate. For 
instance, if you can ping computers B, C, and D from computer A, you don’t 
need to bother with ping tests from computer B, C, or D.

582
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After you have your computers configured and you’ve verified connectivity 
among them, start doing the fun stuff that a network allows you to do, such 
as sharing data, printing, and (most important) playing games with users on 
other computers.
Troubleshooting Your New Network
After a network is set up and operating, it rarely has problems — still, 
Murphy sometimes takes charge, and the darn thing just won’t work right. 
When you do have problems with the network, I recommend using a standard, 
consistent approach to finding and fixing the problem. This section breaks 
down troubleshooting into two areas:
 
✦ The hardware: The best place to start troubleshooting a network 
problem is with the actual equipment, such as the NICs, cables, and 
hubs/switches. (See earlier sections on each equipment type.)
 
✦ The software: The second place to check for problems is in the configu-
ration of the computers on the network, specifically the configuration on 
the computer(s) having the problem that you’re troubleshooting.
Physical problems with your network
Although many things on a network can go bad or cause problems, usually 
network problems are caused by faulty equipment or wiring. Sometimes 
it’s something as simple as a cable not being plugged in snugly. Looking at 
the physical cables, connections, and equipment is always the best place 
to start looking for problems. Here is a quick list of physical things to check 
while trying to fix network problems:
 
1. Make sure that both ends of the network cable are firmly connected.
 
 First check the end that plugs into the computer and then check the end 
that connects to the switch.
 
2. Turn on the problematic computer to be sure that it’s connected to a 
hub or switch.
 
 Check the port on the switch to see whether the link/speed light is lit. 
(Depending on the switch that you have, you might not have a link 
light. Many switches use a speed light to indicate a link. Check the 
manufacturer’s manual for your model.) If your computer is on and 
onnected but no link/speed light is lit, try replacing the network cable.
 
3. If you replace the network cable and there still isn’t light, try 
unplugging the cable from the switch and plug it into another port.
 
 Choose one of the other computers connected to the switch that works, 
unplug it, and plug the broken computer into that port for testing. 
Occasionally, a single port on a switch goes bad; if that happens, just 

Book VII

Troubleshooting Your New Network
mark it as bad and don’t use it anymore. But if all computers connected 
to the switch stop working, it’s probably the switch that’s gone south. 
If the switch is still under warranty, I recommend getting it fixed or 
replaced.
 
4. If you replace the cable, try a different port on the switch, and if other 
computers work fine on that switch, the NIC inside your computer has 
possibly gone bad.
 
 If you reach this determination, call your local service center to have 
it looked at and repaired. If you have an older model on which the NIC 
was added instead of built in, you can simply replace the NIC yourself — 
MacBook owners, unfortunately, don’t have this option.
 
The key when troubleshooting physical problems is the link/speed light on 
the switch. If the link/speed light still doesn’t work, the problem likely isn’t 
physical. Start troubleshooting the network configuration on the computer 
itself.
Network configuration problems
After checking the hardware, look for problems in the network settings. 
When using TCP/IP on your network, look for these specific things: the TCP/
IP configuration mode, IP address, subnet mask, and router IP address (if 
you’re using a router to connect to the Internet or other networks). To check 
these settings, open System Preferences and click the Network icon to bring 
up the Network pane. Click the Ethernet entry in the list and then follow 
these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the Configure IPv4 pop-up menu is set to the appropriate 
option.
 
• Using DHCP: Select the Using DHCP option only if you’re using a 
cable/DSL modem/router or other DHCP server. Otherwise, set this 
to Manually.
 
• Manually: If the configuration is set to Manually, check the IP 
Address, DNS Servers, Router, and Subnet Mask fields to make sure 
that they’re correct. If you’re not sure whether your Subnet Mask 
field entry is correct, you can usually make it the same as other 
computers on the same network with you. Most times, the subnet 
mask is 255.255.255.0.
 
2. To check your Internet connectivity to the rest of the Internet, try 
pinging www.apple.com.
 
 This checks the router and DNS settings.
 
3. If you’re set up for DHCP and your TCP/IP settings remain blank, 
make sure that your DHCP server — which could be your cable/DSL 
modem/router — is turned on and working properly.

✓ Sharing your files and printers with other Macs
✓ Sharing your files with Windows computers
✓ Accessing files on Windows computers
✓ Configuring the built-in firewall
✓ Remote-controlling your MacBook from afar
H
ere’s one of those incredibly complex concepts that you always find 
in these computer books: After you have your network all set up and 
ready to go, you can do all kinds of things with it. (Now wasn’t that utterly 
painless?) You can use your network to share files, share printers, remotely 
control your MacBook, share music across your network using iTunes, or 
even play multiuser games against friends. To keep your files safe from 
unwanted snoops, you can configure the Mac OS X built-in firewall. In this 
chapter, I cover the basics of file sharing, sharing printers, and using the 
firewall to protect yourself from intruders.
It’s All about (File) Sharing
One of the main reasons for building a network is sharing files between 
computers. You might even want to set up a server, which is a computer 
with shared files that are always available to anyone on the network. Think 
of a server as a common file storage area for the rest of the network. Really, 
any computer that shares files is technically a server because it’s serving, 
so to speak. But most people use the word server only to mean a computer 
that’s dedicated solely to serving files, printers, and so on for the rest of the 
network.
Creating an account
Sharing files on your MacBook with other Mac users is a piece of cake. 
Remember, however, that you need to create an account for anyone whom 
you want to have access to your files. The accounts that you create can 
access only three folders, as shown in Figure 2-1:

586
It’s All about (File) Sharing
 
Figure 2-1: 
The location 
of user 
folders and 
the Shared 
folder on 
your hard 
drive.
 
 
✦ The account’s Home folder: That specific account’s Home folder carries 
a short version of the username that’s in the Users folder on your hard 
drive. Figure 2-1 shows the Home folder, which is noted with an icon 
that looks like a house, for the mark account (where mark is the short 
account name for Mark Chambers). The Home folder icon always bears 
the short account name for the user who’s currently logged in.
 
✦ The account’s Public folder: Each user account you create also has a 
Public folder located within its Home folder. Any files you place in the 
Public folder can be accessed by any user on your Mac.
 
✦ The Shared folder: This folder is also in the Users folder on your hard 
drive. Anyone with an account on your Mac can access the Shared 
folder, so it’s a great place to keep common files that everyone wants to 
copy or use.
To create an account, you need to be logged in as an Admin user. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open System Preferences from the Apple menu (Ô) or the Dock.
 
2. Click the Accounts icon.
 
3. Click the New Account button, which carries a plus sign.
 
4. Fill in the appropriate information, including the name for the 
account and a password.
 
 Note that the name that appears as the short name determines the name 
of that user’s Home folder.
 
5. Click Create Account.
 
6. Press Ô+Q to exit System Preferences.

I cover creating accounts in greater detail in Book III, Chapter 5, but that’s 
the short version.
Enabling file sharing
When you enable file sharing, your files are exchanged over Transmission 
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
Follow these steps to turn on sharing:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Select the File Sharing check box to enable it.
Connecting to a shared resource
At the top of the Sharing pane, you can see that other Macintosh users can 
access your laptop at afp://<ip address>, where ip address is the IP 
address for your specific computer. When another Mac user wants to connect 
to your shared files, that person can do the following:
 
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder menu bar.
 
2. After the Connect to Server dialog opens, other Mac users can 
type afp://<ip address> (where ip address is the IP address of your 
MacBook) and then click the Connect button.
 
You can also browse for a shared resource in the Connect to Server dialog. 
Choose Go➪Connect to Server or press Ô+K. Click Browse to locate the 
shared computer. Note that you might be prompted to choose whether you 
want to connect as a Guest or a Registered User. To connect to the server as 
a Registered User, you must supply the right username and password. If you 
connect as Guest, you don’t have to supply a password, but you will have 
restricted access to only the Public folder for each account on the system 
that you connect to. If you need to connect as a Registered User, ask an 
Admin user who controls that Mac to supply you with the correct username 
and password.
Give the username and password that you created to the person using the 
other Mac, and he or she can now access files in that account’s Home folder 
as well as any other Public folders on your computer.
The sidebar that appears in Finder windows offers a Shared heading. Click 
the arrow next to Shared to display other shared resources on your network, 
just as if you had clicked Browse from the Connect to Server dialog. (I’m 
starting to think Snow Leopard might be a synonym for convenience.)

Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing a Connected Printer
Sharing your printer for others to use is one of the best reasons to have a 
network. Setting up your MacBook to share your printer is very easy under 
Mac OS X. Here’s a quick rundown of what you need to do:
 
1. Open System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon under the Internet & Network section to open 
the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Printer Sharing check box to enable it.
 
 By default, when you turn on Printer Sharing, Snow Leopard automatically 
shares all the current printers connected to your MacBook. To select 
which printers can be used for shared printing, click the Print & Fax icon 
in System Preferences. From this pane, you can enable and disable 
sharing on individual printers.
After Printer Sharing is enabled, follow these steps to connect to that printer 
from other computers on your network:
 
1. Click System Preferences in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Print & Fax icon.
 
3. Click the Add button (which carries a plus sign).
 
 You might be prompted to add a printer automatically when the Printer 
Setup Utility opens. Click the Add button to begin the addition. (For 
more on adding a printer with the Printer Setup Utility, see Book VIII, 
Chapter 4.)
 
4. From the Browser window that opens, click the Default button on the 
toolbar.
 
5. Click the shared printer you want to use and then click the Add 
button.
 
Already have the Printer Browser open? Then follow the easier path: Clicking 
the Default toolbar button displays all the available local shared printers. 
Click the desired printer and then click Add.
Sharing Files with Windows Computers
If you’ve deigned to allow PCs running Windows on your network (a generous 
gesture), you’ll probably want to also share files with those computers. 
Sharing files with a Windows PC — actually a Windows user — is very 
similar to sharing files with other Mac users.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
589
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
 
File sharing must be enabled, as I demonstrate earlier in this chapter. (When 
you share with other Macs, you’re also making those files available to PCs.)
To allow file sharing with Windows computers, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
 
4. Click the Options button.
 
5. Click the user account (or accounts) that will be accessible by 
Windows PCs.
 
 Snow Leopard will growl while you try to enable SMB sharing. That’s 
because you have to enable Windows access on the desired account 
before it can be used. Snow Leopard prompts you for your password, 
smugly informing you that the account password will be stored “in a less 
secure manner.” (Take that, Mr. Gates!) Generally, this isn’t a problem, 
but never enable an account for Windows access unless only trusted 
individuals will use it.
 
6. Click the Share files and folders using SMB check box to enable it.
 
7. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System 
Preferences window to save the changes.
Accessing File Shares on Windows Computers
If you allow a Windows PC to access your files, you’ll also probably want to 
putter around with files on a Windows PC. Easy!
Because File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a part 
of the TCP/IP suite, it works on virtually every 
type of computer (over both the Internet and 
your local area network). So, assuming that you 
have your computer connected to the Internet 
through a modem or a local area network (LAN) 
connection, everything that I discuss about 
FTP and how to use it applies to connecting to 
FTP servers on the Internet as well. When you 
connect to FTP servers on the Internet, you can 
use the Fully Qualified Domain Name (or FQDN 
for short), such as ftp.apple.com instead 
of an actual IP address. You can also use the 
FTP server in Mac OS X to make files available 
to friends on the Internet just as you would to 
make them available on a LAN.
Using FTP on the Internet

590
Using FTP to Access Files
Accessing files on Windows computers relies on the Samba component 
(a part of the UNIX foundation of Mac OS X). Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server from the Finder.
 
 The Connect to Server dialog opens.
 
2. In the Address box, enter smb://<ip address>, where ip address is the 
IP address of the Windows computer that you want to connect to.
 
3. Click the Connect button.
 
 Depending on the type of account you have on the Windows PC, Mac OS 
X might display an SMB (Server Message Block) authentication dialog in 
which you can enter your username and password. (Think security for 
the Windows crowd.)
 
4. Select the desired shared drive to mount from the pop-up menu.
 
5. Mount the shared drive according to the Windows version:
 
• If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows 95 or Windows 98 com-
puter: Simply click OK to mount the share.
 
• If you’re accessing a file shared on a Windows NT, 2000, XP, or Vista 
computer: Click the Authenticate button. Then enter your username 
and password, click OK, and then click OK again to mount the share.
After you mount the shared drive, you’ll see it appear on your Desktop, just 
as you see a Mac volume. You can use this drive just as you do any other 
drive on your system. To disconnect from the Windows share, you can
 
✦ Drag the icon to the Trash in the Dock (which changes to an Eject icon 
when you start dragging).
 
✦ Press Ô+E.
 
 or
 
✦ Right-click the icon (tap with two fingers on the trackpad) and then 
choose Eject from the menu that appears.
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite ( the hoary acronym FTP stands 
for File Transfer Protocol. FTP is one of the oldest methods for sharing files 
between computers; however, because it’s part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, 
it can be used on many different kinds of computers, including those running 
just about any type of strange and arcane operating system. You can still 
manage to exchange files regardless of whether you’re using Mac OS X, 
Windows, Linux, or UNIX. (Heck, even dinosaurs like DOS can join the party.)

Book VII
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
591
Using FTP to Access Files
FTP is a client/server application. In plain English, this means that two pieces 
make things tick: the server (which hosts the connection, rather like a file 
server) and the client (which connects to the server). Mac OS X, thanks to its 
UNIX foundation, has both an FTP server and client built in. To use FTP, you 
need a computer running the FTP server software to give others access to 
files; then the other computer, or client, can connect to the FTP server. 
After the connection is made, the client can either send files to the server 
(uploading) or get files from the server (downloading). In this section, I cover 
how to use FTP to give others access to your files as well as talk about the 
FTP applications that come with Mac OS X.
Using the Mac OS X built-in FTP to share files
One way to give others access to your files is to run an FTP server on your 
MacBook. Mac OS X comes with an FTP server built in, so you just have to 
activate it. You might wonder why you’d use FTP to share files when you 
can use Personal File Sharing or Windows File Sharing. The main advantage 
to FTP is compatibility: Not only can people on your LAN access files, but 
anyone on the Internet can also access your files, regardless of the type of 
machine they’re using.
Just as you do with the other file-sharing methods, you need to create a 
user account on your computer before someone can connect to and get files 
from your MacBook. After you have accounts created for the users, you can 
enable FTP sharing like this:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the File Sharing entry.
 
4. Click the Options button.
 
5. Click the Share Files and Folders Using FTP check box to enable it.
 
 Always helpful, Snow Leopard reminds you on the Advanced sheet 
that people can use ftp://<ip address>, where ip address is the IP 
address of your Mac.
 
6. Click Done to exit the Advanced dialog, and close the System 
Preferences window to save the changes.
 
If you’re using an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station or other cable/digital 
subscriber line (DSL) router to share your Internet connection, place the 
Mac that you want people on the Internet to access in a DMZ, or demilitarized 
zone. Check your cable/DSL router documentation for more information.

592
Using FTP to Access Files
Using FTP from Terminal to transfer files
You can use FTP to transfer files with an FTP server by using the command-line 
interface (CLI); to use the CLI, open a Terminal, or shell, session. To use 
a Terminal session, double-click the Terminal icon in the Utilities folder 
inside the Applications folder. When you open a Terminal session, you’re 
presented with a window that accepts text commands. You’ll see a prompt 
that consists of your computer’s name and the folder that you’re currently 
in, followed by your user ID. It’s at this prompt where you type various FTP 
commands.
After you’re in the Terminal session, you’ll use a series of commands to 
connect to another computer, move in and out of folders, and transfer files. 
Following is a list of the basic commands that you need to use FTP as well as 
a brief description of what each command does.
 
✦ ftp: This command starts the FTP command-line interface session. You 
can tell that you’re in the FTP client application when you see ftp> as 
your command prompt. This is where you type all other FTP commands 
to do things.
 
✦ open: This command is used to start your connection to another 
computer. Type this command followed by the IP address of the FTP 
server that you want to connect to.
 
✦ ls: Use this command to see a listing of all files and folders in the 
current folder on the FTP server.
 
✦ cd: This command allows you to change the folder that you’re in. Type 
cd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to move into a 
subfolder on the FTP server. Type cd .. (that’s c, d, space, and two 
periods) to go back out a folder level.
 
✦ lcd: This command acts exactly like cd except that it changes the folder 
that you’re currently in on your local system, not the FTP server. Use 
this command to put yourself in the folder on the local drive that you 
want to transfer files to and from.
 
✦ bin: Type this command to get in binary mode to transfer files that 
aren’t plain-text files. (Always use binary mode unless you’re specifically 
transferring plain-text files.)
 
✦ ascii: This command puts you in ASCII mode for transferring text files.
 
✦ get or mget: To retrieve a single file, use the get command followed 
by the filename of the file that you want to retrieve. If you want to get 
multiple files at one time, use the mget command followed by a filename, 
possibly containing * and/or ? as wildcards.
 
✦ put or mput: To send a single file, use the put command followed by 
the filename to send a file to the FTP server. To send multiple files, use 
the mput command followed by a filename, possibly containing * and/or 
? as wildcards.

Book VII
Chapter 2
Using Your Network
593
Using the Built-in Firewall
 
✦ quit: Use the quit command to end your FTP session.
To end a Terminal session and exit Terminal at any time, press Ô+Q. 
Terminal prompts you for confirmation if necessary.
 
Many FTP servers will let you send files only to certain folders. Most times 
this folder is named Upload, Uploads, or something similar.
Using these commands will enable you to exchange files with an FTP server. 
Here’s an example of how to use these commands within the Terminal 
window:
 
1. Type ftp to get into FTP mode.
 
2. Type open <ip address> (where ip address is the server’s network IP 
address) to open your connection to the FTP server.
 
3. At this point, you’re asked for a username and password.
 
 For many FTP servers, using the username anonymous and your e-mail 
address as the password is enough to get you logged in. Some sites even 
allow you to log in without any username or password at all. On secure 
sites, however, you must use an assigned username and password 
provided by the administrator of that particular server.
 
4. Type lcd <folder> (where folder is a specific folder name) to change 
into the folder on your local drive that you want files to come to or 
from.
 
5. Type the ls and cd commands to place yourself into the desired folder 
on the FTP server.
 
6. Type the ascii or bin command to set your file transfer mode to ASCII 
or binary, respectively.
 
 This is important because choosing the wrong type will likely cause the 
transfer to fail. Unless it’s a plain-text file, always use binary mode.
 
7. Type the get, mget, put, and mput commands to send or receive the 
desired files.
 
8. Type the quit command to close the connection and exit the FTP session.
Using the Built-in Firewall
A firewall watches all the network communications coming into your 
MacBook. It automatically plays the role of security guard, blocking or 
denying certain network traffic that you want to prevent from reaching 
your laptop. It acts as another layer of security to help keep you safe from 
unwanted attacks. That’s all well and good, but you must be careful to set up 
your firewall correctly before you turn it on: A configuration mistake could 
make your MacBook inaccessible from the network.

594
Using the Built-in Firewall
For instance, if you want to enable FTP access on your MacBook but you 
also want to keep all other traffic from coming into your system, you can tell 
the built-in firewall to allow only FTP traffic. The firewall on the MacBook 
will block or allow only TCP/IP traffic — not Bonjour — so Bonjour traffic 
(which is always from your local network and not the Internet, anyway) can 
always get in.
When enabled, the firewall blocks all traffic that comes into your MacBook. 
By default, however, the firewall is turned off. So, your first job is to enable 
the firewall, which you can do by following these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the Firewall tab.
 
4. Click the Start button to turn on your firewall.
 
5. Click the Advanced button to show the settings that you see in 
Figure 2-2.
 
Figure 2-2: 
You can 
help protect 
your 
MacBook by 
using Snow 
Leopard’s 
built-in 
firewall.
 
 
6. Click the Automatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming 
Connections radio button to select it.
This enables the firewall. And, by default, virtually all incoming TCP/IP traffic 
is blocked. You must enable each sharing method that you want to be able 
to use. When you enable different sharing methods from the Sharing pane in 
System Preferences (such as File Sharing or FTP Access), you’ll notice that 
those types of traffic now appear in the Firewall list. (In other words, when 
you turn on a sharing method, the firewall automatically allows traffic for 
that sharing method, which Snow Leopard calls a service. Most excellent.)

Book VII

595
Remote Control of Your MacBook
 
Click the up/down arrow icon to the right of any service to specify whether 
the firewall should allow or block connections.
Sometimes, you might want to allow other traffic through your firewall that 
isn’t on the firewall list of recognized services and applications. At that 
point, you can click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to specify the 
application that your firewall should allow. Snow Leopard presents you 
with the familiar Add dialog, and you can choose the application that needs 
access.
Remote Control of Your MacBook
Forgive me whilst I wax techno-nerd here: One of the coolest advantages 
to a network is the ability to take control of one computer from another 
computer. For example, sometimes you might need to access files on your 
Mac Pro desktop while you’re on a trip, but you don’t have File Sharing 
enabled. What can you do? You can remotely connect into your Mac Pro 
and then — just as if you were sitting in front of it — enable File Sharing 
(as I demonstrate earlier in the chapter). Perhaps you have a file on your 
computer with someone’s phone number that you suddenly need on the 
road. With remote control, it’s at your fingertips! (Sigh . . . ah, technology.)
Using Screen Sharing
Snow Leopard’s Screen Sharing feature, which is available from iChat, can be 
turned on for individual users from the Sharing pane in System Preferences. 
You can allow access for all user accounts on your MacBook or limit remote 
access to selected users. Screen Sharing is Apple’s implementation of Virtual 
Network Computing (VNC) technology.
To set up Screen Sharing, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Screen Sharing check box to select it.
 
4. To limit remote access for specific accounts, click the Only these users 
radio button, and click the Add button (which bears a plus sign) to 
select a user.
 
5. Close the System Preferences window to save the change.
After you’ve enabled screen sharing, you can use the Buddies➪Share My 
Screen menu item in iChat to share your screen with another person. To 
view another person’s screen, use the Buddies➪Share Remote Screen menu 
item. (For the details on iChat and Screen Sharing, see Book VI, Chapter 3.)

596
Remote Control of Your MacBook
Remotely control your MacBook (for free, no less!)
Virtual Network Computing (or VNC, available for many platforms at 
www.realvnc.com) is a very nice application that enables you to remotely 
control a computer from pretty much anywhere that has an Internet 
connection. VNC is easy to install and configure, and it runs on many 
different platforms, ranging from Windows XP and UNIX on desktop 
computers and servers to Palm OS and Windows CE on personal digital 
assistants (PDAs). Wrap your mind around this: You could be at a friend’s 
house on her wireless network and use your PDA to remotely control your 
MacBook at home over the Internet. Pure, undiluted sassy!
 
Some networks have proxies and firewalls that might interfere with VNC’s 
operation. You can remotely control a computer that’s behind a firewall or 
cable/DSL router, but the firewall/router needs to be configured properly. 
Because the process varies from one manufacturer to the next, check your 
cable/DSL router manual for instructions on how to do this.
How VNC works
In a nutshell, VNC takes the graphical interface on your monitor, turns it into 
data, and sends it to the computer that you’re using to remotely control it. 
The computer that you’re using sends keyboard presses, trackpad movements, 
and clicks to it, acting just the same way as it would if you were sitting right 
in front of it.
 
As I mention earlier, you can use Snow Leopard’s Screen Sharing feature 
in iChat to make a remote connection from another Mac to your MacBook. 
However, you’re not limited to using just another Mac using Snow Leopard 
and Screen Sharing in iChat — you can control your MacBook from a 
Windows PC, or from an older version of Mac OS X as well! If you’ve already 
enabled Screen Sharing (as I demonstrate earlier in this chapter), follow 
these steps to enable any VNC connection:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon to open the Sharing Preferences pane.
 
3. Click the Screen Sharing entry.
 
4. Click the Computer Settings button.
 
5. Click the VNC Viewers May Control Screen with Password check box 
to select it.
 
6. Click within the password text box and enter a password for VNC 
applications.
 
7. Click OK to exit the Computer Settings sheet, and close the System 
Preferences window to save the changes.

Remote Control of Your MacBook
Figure 2-3 shows a screenshot of a Mac running Mac OS X Tiger being 
remotely controlled from a computer running Windows 98. (Yes, I know, it’s 
a travesty, but then again, sometimes you’ve just gotta use what you’ve got.)
 
Figure 2-3: 
Yes, bucko, 
that’s

Mr. Paranoia speaks again: Make doggone sure that you set up the password 
access correctly for VNC or don’t run it! I can’t stress enough how much fun 
a hacker would have with free remote control over your Mac OS X Desktop.
Remote control of another computer 
from your MacBook
A few different VNC viewers exist for Mac OS X. A VNC viewer is just an 
application you use to remotely control another computer running VNC. 
You can download them at www.realvnc.com/download.html. If you 
find yourself on a computer without a VNC viewer — heaven forbid — VNC 
server actually runs over the Web as well! As long as the computer that 
you’re using has a Web browser that supports Java — which Safari does — 
you can still remotely control your computer.
When you connect to the computer running VNC using a Web browser, 
the Web server sends a default page that contains a Java applet. That Java 
applet asks you for the password to connect; upon entering the correct 
password, it brings up the remote control session right in the Web browser.

N
owadays, wireless connectivity is king. For example, wireless phones 
have gone from being a toy of the technological elite to a permanent 
fixture on the hip of the common man. The shorts that I’m wearing right 
now have a special pocket just for a cellphone to ride in; when I’m without 
my phone, it usually carries a 5th Avenue candy bar. (Perhaps that was too 
personal . . . sorry.)
Because people have become accustomed to keeping in touch from 
wherever they are, they also want to have access to their network, at least 
within their house or workplace, without the hassle of cables. (Which, by 
the way, are magnets for pets that enjoy a good chew toy.) This desire for 
convenience and the advances in wireless technology have combined to 
bring you the concept of the wireless network — as well as wireless coffee 
shops, wireless access providers, and even wireless gaming centers. (In fact, 
Apple’s iPhone is a wireless Internet marvel, with instant connectivity to any 
Bluetooth-enabled Mac and full-featured e-mail and browsing that’ll knock 
your socks off.)
Now you can be connected to your home local area network (LAN) and 
your shared Internet connection (which I cover in Book VII, Chapter 4) from 
your balcony, deck, lounge chair in the yard, or even your bedroom. In this 
chapter, I talk about how wireless networks work and then I give you a lot 
of information to help you get the right pieces to free yourself — securely, 
mind you — from the world of the wired.
Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Wireless networks aren’t all that different from their wired siblings. In this 
chapter, I discuss some of the features and limitations of wireless networking, 
but you must first be familiar with a foundation of information.

Speaking the Wireless Lingo
Because of the technology involved in wireless networks and how things 
are changing rapidly in this area, you’ll find yourself swimming in a sea of 
acronyms and other techno-babble. Although you don’t need to know every 
little detail to be able to set up your own wireless network, you should know 
some of these terms so that you can avoid getting stung by hackers or stuck 
with equipment that’s on the verge of obsolescence. 
Here’s a quick list of terms that you’ll see on your road to becoming a 
wireless network guru:
 
✦ WLAN: WLAN stands for Wireless LAN. If you read previous chapters in 
this minibook, you know that a LAN (local area network) is just a bunch 
of connected computers and other devices.
 
✦ IEEE: This stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, 
which is an organization that approves standards that allow computers, 
network equipment, and just about anything else electronic to play 
nicely together. Sometimes IEEE helps create these standards before 
approving them, and sometimes it just approves standards that others 
have produced.
 
✦ 802.11: This is the part of the IEEE standards that deals specifically with 
wireless networking. 
 
 Although wireless is usually generically referred to as wireless networks 
(or sometimes even Wi-Fi), it’s all really a wireless form of Ethernet.
 
✦ Wireless access point: A wireless access point, or WAP, is a device that 
allows wireless network devices to connect to a wired Ethernet network.
 
✦ Service Set Identifier: The Service Set Identifier, or SSID, is used to tell 
your computer the name of the wireless network that you want to use.
 
✦ Wired Equivalency Privacy: Wired Equivalency Privacy, or WEP, is 
an encryption that wireless networks can use to keep your wireless 
network more secure from snoopers and hackers.
 
✦ Wi-Fi Protected Access: Usually referred to as WPA, this is a security 
protocol that’s more robust and harder to crack than WEP. The latest 
version, WPA2, is a common security feature on today’s wireless hardware. 
 
✦ Ad Hoc mode: An Ad Hoc wireless network is one in which each wireless 
device talks directly with all other wireless devices. 
 
 Apple calls Ad Hoc mode a computer-to-computer network.
 
✦ Infrastructure mode: This is where all wireless devices talk to a WAP, 
and the WAP then talks to other wireless devices and the wired network.
As I cover the different parts of wireless networking and how to set it up, 
you’ll find yourself using these terms over and over. Before you know it, 
you’ll be spouting these wireless-related acronyms like a pro. (No, really. I’m 
not kidding.)

Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
One of the first things that you might notice when you start looking into 
wireless networking is the existence of different wireless standards. You 
should at least be aware that these different standards exist: That way, you 
can be sure to get wireless network components that will work together 
because some of the different wireless standards are not compatible. (Feel free 
to photocopy this list and stick it on your fridge door.)
Basic Wi-Fi: 802.11b
IEEE 802.11b has another name that you’ll likely see on product advertisements, 
literature, or boxes in stores: Wi-Fi, which stands for Wireless Fidelity. 
(Kinda like that cutting-edge Hi-Fi stereo from the ’60s and ’70s, where Hi-Fi 
stands for High Fidelity.) Most folks proclaim Wi-Fi as only 802.11b. Wi-Fi 
was the first version of wireless Ethernet. This version of wireless runs at 
speeds up to 11 million bits per second, or 11 Mbps. The reason I say that it 
runs at speeds up to 11 Mbps is because the actual speed at which the data 
is transferred depends on things like signal strength and quality. When the 
conditions are such that your signal strength or quality is decreased — 
such as an inconvenient concrete wall between you and your AirPort Base 
Station — you might find that your wireless connection changes down to 5.5 
Mbps, 2 Mbps, or even as slow as 1 Mbps.
802.11b has been largely supplanted in current wireless networking, and 
almost all the equipment you can buy today is either 802.11g or 802.11n 
(both of which I cover in a moment). However, if you’re working with older 
computers and existing 802.11b hardware, any networking equipment you 
buy should be backward compatible with 802.11b.
 
Apple’s AirPort network cards and standard-issue AirPort Base Station used 
802.11b. In fact, it’s time for Mac owners to swell with pride yet again: Apple 
was the first computer company to ship 802.11b hardware. (Back then, in 
1999, it was the original AirPort Base Station.) Now, of course, Apple has 
raised the bar with AirPort Extreme, which I discuss later in this chapter, 
and the AirPort Express mobile Base Station.
In theory, Wi-Fi network cards have the ability to communicate with other 
Wi-Fi devices and WAPs that are up to 1,000 feet away. Having said that, 
realize that 1,000 feet is a generous estimate when outdoors on a clear day 
with no wind blowing — you see what I’m getting at. (You’re more likely to 
see a wildebeest wearing a hula skirt in your living room than see that kind 
of distance indoors.) In reality, when you set up your wireless network, 
things such as walls — especially concrete walls, as in basements — and 
areas with lots of electrical wiring decrease the distance that you can cover. 
If you use a WAP, plan on no more than 150 feet between wireless computers 
and the WAP. However, your mileage might vary.

602
Figuring Out the Different Flavors of Wireless Ethernet
 
That 11 Mbps bandwidth is shared between all computers using it. Collisions 
can also occur if more than one computer tries to communicate at the same 
time. If you have a lot of people on your wireless network, the network will 
get noticeably slower because of increased collisions. Remember that the 
total bandwidth is shared among the computers on the wireless network. 
This applies not only to Wi-Fi but also to the 802.11a (which I cover in the 
nearby sidebar) and the 802.11g standards.
 
One last thing about 802.11b networking: Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz frequency 
range. It actually uses 11 different channels, but they’re all around the 2.4 
GHz range. If you’re using a 2.4 GHz cordless phone or even a microwave, 
using either device can definitely interfere with or even shut down your 
wireless network. Keep this in mind when you buy your next phone or 
wonder why your file transfers stop when you’re communing with Orville 
Redenbacher in the microwave.
Let’s get Extreme: 802.11g
Apple’s release of the first generation of AirPort Extreme provided both the 
speed of 802.11a and the compatibility with Wi-Fi. That’s because it used the 
802.11g standard, which operates at speeds up to 54 Mbps (as did 802.11a) 
but will also operate at the same frequency ranges and play nicely with 
existing 802.11b equipment. (Notice that we’re heading in the right direction 
again when it comes to naming conventions. Go figure.)
 
Apple was once again the first company to offer 802.11g hardware as 
standard equipment. Feel free to enjoy the Superiority Dance yet again.
Naturally, there’s a downside: 802.11g returned to that pesky 2.4 GHz range, 
so your cordless phone and microwave can also wreak the same havoc that 
they did with your original AirPort equipment.
Raising the bar to 802.11n
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the current wireless standard from IEEE: 
802.11n. Most third-party manufacturers (including Apple) now offer only 
802.11n wireless equipment. Apple’s 802.11n products include the current 
AirPort Extreme base station, the AirPort Extreme hardware in all of the 
MacBook line, and the spiffy Apple TV.
Why the hubbub? Oh, I forgot to mention that 802.11n can deliver throughput in 
excess of 100 Mbps! Don’t bet your house that you’ll get that kind of speed, 
though — as with the other members of the 802.11 family, that’s likely to be 
a theoretical maximum speed.
You can’t go wrong with the 802.11n standard — think superfast wireless 
connections in your household or office. Ahh, technology. . . .

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
The guy with the turquoise teeth
I should also mention Bluetooth — a strange name for a wireless standard, 
I admit, but it works like a charm. Bluetooth devices use 2.4 GHz as well, 
but they’re designed only for very short distances . . . up to only about 30 
feet. Bluetooth is the future for linking mobile devices (such as personal 
digital assistants and cell phones) and external peripherals (such as wireless 
keyboards and mice) to your MacBook. In fact, Bluetooth can turn your 
MacBook into a completely cordless machine — except for the power cord, 
of course. Snow Leopard provides built-in support for Bluetooth through the 
iSync application and the Bluetooth pane in System Preferences.
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
Are you worried about the security of your AirPort wireless network? You 
should be, bunkie. Imagine someone in the next apartment or house — or 
standing right in your street — intercepting and monitoring your data from 
your wireless network.
802.11a was a newer version of wireless 
Ethernet than 802.11b. 802.11b came out first, 
and 802.11a came out next. (I guess someone 
ran into a doorframe.) 802.11a doesn’t have 
a generally recognized handy nickname like 
Wi-Fi, so just call it 802.11a.
802.11a equipment isn’t compatible with Wi-Fi 
or older 802.11b AirPort Base Stations, so don’t 
make the mistake of buying both 802.11b and 
802.11a network equipment. Instead, I strongly 
recommend that you follow the AirPort Extreme 
course charted by Apple and use the 802.11g 
or 802.11n standards (which are backward 
compatible with Wi-Fi). Just in case, the 
current AirPort Extreme base station (which 
uses 802.11n) does support 802.11a — hats off 
again to the folks in Cupertino!
802.11a can run at speeds up to 54 Mbps — 
almost five times faster than Wi-Fi. This is 
because 802.11a uses the 5 GHz frequency 
range instead of the cluttered 2.4 GHz range 
that Wi-Fi uses. The powers that be set aside 
the 5 GHz range just for wireless networking, 
so cordless phones and microwaves (or any 
other wireless devices, for that matter) can’t 
interfere with the network. The downside to 
using the higher 5 GHz range, though, is that 
the distances that can be covered are even 
less than that of Wi-Fi — no more than about 
60 feet to maintain the highest speeds.
Because of the incompatibilities with 802.11b 
and the arrival of 802.11g and 802.11n, 802.11a 
equipment has all but disappeared, and you 
should steer clear of it with a wide berth. 
(In fact, good luck finding 802.11a hardware 
anywhere but eBay.)
802.11a networks

Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
But before you decide to toss the idea of a wireless network, keep this in 
mind: Even though it is technically possible that someone might camp out 
on your doorstep in order to gain access to your wireless network, for most 
home networks, this possibility isn’t very probable. Even if someone tries 
to gain access to your wireless network and perhaps even sniff your 
network — a techno-nerd term meaning to record all the data flying around 
a network — there isn’t a whole lot someone can do with that information.
 
If a friend invites you for an evening of war driving, think “recreational 
mobile hacking.” War driving is the act of driving through neighborhoods 
in a car equipped with a laptop computer and a wireless network card. The 
payoff? If the hacker is lucky enough to locate a house with an open wireless 
network, we’re talking free wireless Internet access . . . from the comfort of 
his car! (Not to mention any shared files or information that’s available 
on that network.) Again, keep security in mind when installing wireless 
hardware, and these bozos will get nothing from your network.
You might say, “But I use my credit card on the Internet to buy stuff.” Sure, 
this is a valid concern; however, if you purchase things on the Internet with 
your credit card, you should already be using a secure connection provided 
by the Web site for your personal information so that the data you’re send-
ing across your wireless network is already encrypted and relatively safe 
from thieves. (You can find more on this when I discuss Safari in detail in 
Book VI, Chapter 5.)
“I have shared my files on my computer. Can the Bad Guys access those 
shared files?” Another good question, but if you read Book VII, Chapter 2, 
you know that you have to create an account for those whom you want to 
access your files. Unless the would-be hacker is very good at guessing 
usernames and passwords, your files are pretty safe, too.
This is not to say that you bear absolutely no risk of being hacked. If a 
legitimate user on your wireless network connects to your computer and 
starts transferring a file, a would-be hacker could potentially record all the 
traffic and then reconstruct the file that was sent from the data that was 
recorded. In other words, a hacker could grab that user’s username and 
password. That’s where WPA comes in.
WPA and WPA2
Wi-Fi Protected Access, or WPA, is A Good Thing (even if it makes for a 
silly-sounding acronym). It’s currently the standard encryption protocol 
offered for home wireless networking — WPA2 standard is the latest version, 
and is even better at defending your wireless network. As you might expect, 
all of Apple’s current AirPort wireless hardware uses WPA2 security, as does 
most of the wireless hardware you’ll find on the shelf at your local Hardware 
Heaven electronics store. (It’s still a good idea to check the specifications on 
the box, though, to make sure that WPA2 is supported.)

Book VII
Chapter 3
Going Wireless
605
Keeping Your Wireless Network Secure
WPA2 works well as a deterrent to keep the wrong people out of your stuff. 
Although WPA2 isn’t going to ward off the spies at the National Security 
Agency, it’s good enough to protect home and small-business networks.
WEP
WEP is an old friend of mine. Short for Wired Equivalency Privacy, it’s 
another ridiculous acronym for another wireless security system. WEP 
was one of the first widely supported wireless encryption schemes, but in 
today’s world, WEP is now outdated and pretty easy for a hacker to outwit. I 
strongly recommend that your network use WPA2 whenever possible.
Apple’s implementation of WEP comes in two varieties: 40 bit and 128 bit. 
The more bits used in the encryption, the more secure (and the better) it is.
To use WEP, you need to select a WEP key, which is really just a code word:
 
✦ The longer the key, the better. 
 
✦ When making a key, use something like ab8sher7234ksief87 (something 
that’s random with letters and numbers) as opposed to something, like 
mykey, that’s easily guessed. 
If you’re using an Ad Hoc wireless network, all the computers need to have 
their wireless network card configured with the same WEP key in order to 
communicate. If you’re using a WAP to connect to the rest of the network, 
you need to use the same key on your computers that you’ve configured on 
your WAP.
 
One thing to note about WEP is that it’s been broken, meaning that someone 
has figured out how to undo the encryption that WEP provides. For businesses, 
especially those with sensitive data, WEP isn’t a good security solution.
The LEAP security standard
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is an encryption 
protocol developed by Cisco Systems for superior security in the business 
world. To use LEAP, you need to have a server that’s set up to enable users 
to log in to gain permission to the wireless network. After you initially log in 
(authenticate) to your network, LEAP changes encryption keys on the fly at 
a time interval that you determine. You could set it so that every 15 minutes 
your encryption key is changed: Even if someone is in that hypothetical tent 
on your front lawn, he could never record enough packets to figure out your 
key because it changes so often.
 
Setting up a server so that you can use LEAP isn’t something for the novice 
to attempt. I would encourage you to read up on LEAP only if you’re very 
serious about airtight security on your WLAN. The Cisco Web site (www.
cisco.com) is a good place to read about LEAP.

606
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
 
All current AirPort Extreme wireless network cards and Base Stations are 
compatible with the Cisco LEAP for higher security.
Setting Up Your Wireless Network
On to the good stuff. This section describes how to set up an Ad Hoc or 
infrastructure-based WLAN (wireless LAN).
 
All of today’s MacBooks come with an AirPort Extreme (802.11n) card built 
in, so you don’t have to add or install any wireless hardware to create or use 
a wireless network!
Setting up an Ad Hoc wireless network
Using an Ad Hoc network — also called a computer-to-computer network — is 
a fairly easy thing to accomplish in Mac OS X. Plus, you’re not limited to just 
Macs: With an Ad Hoc network, you can also swap niceties with PCs and 
PDAs that have 802.11b/g/n network interface cards (NICs) installed. This Ad 
Hoc network is great for setting up an impromptu network in a classroom, 
exchanging recipes and pictures at a family reunion in a park, or blowing 
your friend up while gaming across the aisle of a Greyhound bus at 70 mph.
To set up an Ad Hoc network, you first have to create the computer-to-
computer network on one of your Macs. This takes advantage of the AirPort 
Software Base Station that’s built into Snow Leopard. 
To create a computer-to-computer network, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
 
 If you haven’t set Snow Leopard to display your AirPort status in the 
Finder menu bar, follow these steps:
 
a. Open the Network pane in System Preferences and choose the AirPort 
entry in the list at the left of the pane. 
 
b. Enable the Show AirPort Status in Menu Bar check box.
 
c. Close the System Preferences window to save your changes.
 
2. Click Create Network to display the dialog that you see in Figure 3-1.
 
3. Enter a name for your network.
 
4. Mark the Require Password check box to turn on WEP encryption.
 
5. Enter a password for your network and then enter it again to 
confirm it.

Figure 3-1:

Excellent.
 
 
 Although you can leave encryption disabled, I highly recommend that 
you turn it on and choose a password for that extra bit of security. (Just 
call me Security Man.) Note that the password must be an exact length 
(which is determined by whether you choose a 40-bit [5-character] key 
or a 128-bit [13-character] key).
Because of Apple’s implementation of wireless 
standards within the AirPort Extreme product 
line, keep in mind some things when trying to mix 
Apple wireless equipment with other vendors’ 
802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n equipment. As 
you discover elsewhere in this chapter, using 
AirPort wireless networks can require a WPA 
password that corresponds to the 802.11b/g/n 
WPA key for encryption. However, the 
password that you enter for AirPort networks 
isn’t exactly the same as the WEP key for 
that same network. If you’re using an AirPort 
network card and are trying to connect to a 
non-Apple WAP, you need to follow a specific 
procedure. You can find this procedure by 
going to http://search.info.apple.
com and searching on the words 802.11 
Compatibility.
You want my opinion? Because of the issues 
of using non-AirPort 802.11b/g/n hardware 
with The Real Thing (AirPort/AirPort Extreme 
stuff), I recommend that you stick with Apple 
equipment if possible.

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
 
 In general, channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ones that don’t overlap 
other channels — and are therefore the best choices to use. If you’re 
close to other WAPs, AirPort Base Stations, or other Ad Hoc networks, 
try to find a channel that’s not being used, or performance can be 
degraded. (If you have only one access point, it doesn’t matter which 
channel you select — just allow Snow Leopard to automatically select a 
channel, which is typically Channel 11.)
 
6. Click OK.
Creating a computer-to-computer network gives the illusion of having an 
AirPort Base Station. So for people to join your network, they would follow 
the same steps as those they would use to join any other AirPort network, as 
I cover in the next section.
Setting up wireless networks with 
an AirPort Base Station
After one computer is running a computer-to-computer network or you’ve 
set up and configured an AirPort/AirPort Extreme Base Station, you’re ready 
to invite other computers with wireless hardware to the party.
Joining in an existing AirPort network
After you have a network set up on one of your wireless-enabled computers, 
you just need to have the other wireless-enabled computers join that network. 
You can use the same process, as I describe here, to join any wireless 
network:
 
1. Click the AirPort status icon on the menu bar.
 
 A list of existing network connections appears in the AirPort menu.
 
2. Select an existing network connection that you’d like to join.
 
 If you want to join a network whose name doesn’t appear in the list — 
also called a closed network, follow these steps:
 
a. Select Join Other Network from the AirPort status menu.
 
b. Enter the name of the network that you want to join and the password 
(if any is required). 
 
 A closed network is another added measure of security — one that’s 
good enough for most people because it’s very unlikely that a hacker is 
going to try to hack a hidden network.

Setting Up Your Wireless Network
Disconnecting from an AirPort network
To disconnect from an AirPort/AirPort Extreme network, you can turn off 
your AirPort card altogether, which I cover in the next section. (Simplicity, 
they say, is an art.) Another way is to simply connect to another AirPort 
network — but this option is really only useful if you actually want to 
connect to another network.
Turning your AirPort hardware on or off
Being able to turn your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware on and off 
actually has its uses:
 
✦ You might want to use your MacBook in a place where your wireless 
card shouldn’t be used, like 
 
• An airplane (when they tell you to turn off all cell phones) 
 
• A hospital area that doesn’t allow cell phones or other wireless 
devices
 
✦ Turning off your AirPort/AirPort Extreme hardware conserves your 
MacBook’s battery life. 
To turn your AirPort equipment on or off via the AirPort status icon on the 
menu bar, give it a click and choose Turn AirPort On/Off from the resulting 
menu.

Chapter 4: Sharing That Precious 
Internet Thing
In This Chapter
✓ Finding out how Internet sharing works
✓ Choosing between hardware and software Internet sharing
✓ Connecting your Macs to a cable/DSL router
✓ Adding wireless support to a shared Internet connection
A
lthough I discuss lots of fun stuff that you can do with your network in 
previous chapters, this has to be my favorite: sharing a single Internet 
connection between all the computers on your network. If you have more 
than one computer, I’m sure that you’ve had to deal with the dilemma that 
pops up whenever more than one person wants or needs to access the 
Internet at the same time.
Luckily, because small home and office local area networks (LANs) use our 
old friend TCP/IP for network communications, connecting an entire network 
to the Internet isn’t as troublesome a task as you might think. In this 
chapter, I talk about different hardware and software options for sharing 
your MacBook’s Internet connection as well as how to include your wireless 
devices.
Sharing the Internet
Sharing a single Internet connection among all your computers can be a 
boon simply because of the reduced chances of random acts of violence. 
(Internet deprivation can be an ugly thing, you know.) Although I won’t 
claim that Internet sharing will save lives, it can indeed save you from 
headaches and arguments when more than one person wants to use the 
Internet at one time.
 
Throughout this chapter, I talk a lot about cable modems and Asynchronous 
Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) modems. Both of these are high-speed 
Internet connections — and both are relatively inexpensive — that are 
offered by your local cable company and your local phone company, 
respectively. The phone company offers different kinds of digital subscriber 

612
Using Network Address Translation
line (DSL) connections, the most common of which is ADSL. However, 
because different kinds of DSL connections exist, in this chapter I refer to 
them all generically as DSL.
To share your Internet connection, you need a few things, so here’s a brief 
checklist:
 
✦ An Internet connection: Typically, this is a cable or DSL modem 
connection, but older versions of the AirPort Base Station can use a 
dial-up Internet connection that’s accessed via a standard v.90/v.92 
analog telephone modem. (Note that recent models of the AirPort 
Extreme Base Station do not have the capability to use analog dial-up 
connections.)
 
✦ A LAN: You need a standard LAN (which is connected with cables) or 
a wireless LAN. (Heck, you can even have a hybrid that has both wired 
and wireless access.) See Book VII, Chapter 1 for more information 
about setting up a LAN; see Book VII, Chapter 3 for more on setting up a 
Wireless LAN (WLAN).
 
✦ An Internet-sharing device: I use the word device because the method 
that you use to share your Internet connection could be through software 
that you run on one of your computers or hardware that is stand-alone, 
depending on how you connect to the Internet and what best fits your 
needs.
When you have these three things ready to go, you can share your Internet 
connection. However, you need to know some background information to 
help you choose the right components and get everything up and running.
Using Network Address Translation
You must determine one thing before you start your Internet sharing quest: 
the set of network Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that you’ll use. If you 
used Book VII, Chapter 1 to set up and configure your LAN, you might recall 
that I suggest a specific range of IP addresses to use on your LAN. In case 
you missed out on Chapter 1 of this minibook, I briefly cover this important 
topic here so that you can share your Internet connection smoothly. 
(Forgive me if I wax technical, but ’tis only for the moment.)

Book VII
Chapter 4
Sharing That 
Precious Internet 
Thing
613
Using Network Address Translation
When talking about IP addresses, the ruling body that tracks IP addresses 
and where they’re used has broken all IP addresses into two parts:
 
✦ Public IP addresses: Public IP addresses are used to communicate on 
the Internet, and only one device in the entire world can use a given 
public IP address at any given time.
 
✦ Private IP addresses: Private addresses, on the other hand, are supposed 
to be used only on networks (such as your home LAN) and do not 
connect directly to the Internet. Lots of people can use the same private 
address because their networks never go public; that is, they never 
directly access the Internet, so their IP addresses never conflict.
Typically, you’ll use private addresses in the form of 192.168.x.x on your 
LAN; however, AirPort Extreme routers use private addresses in the form of 
10.0.x.x by default. See Book VII, Chapter 1 for an overview of IP addresses 
and how they work.
You might be wondering to yourself thusly: “If I use private IP addresses 
on my LAN at home or in the office and I have to use a public IP address to 
communicate on the Internet, how can my private IP addresses on my LAN 
communicate with public IP addresses on the Internet?” That is an excellent 
question, and the answer is Network Address Translation (or NAT, for short).
NAT acts as a gatekeeper between your private IP addresses on your LAN 
and the public IP addresses on the Internet. When you connect to the 
Internet, your Internet service provider (ISP) gives you one — and usually 
only one — public IP address that can be used on the Internet. Instead of one 
of your computers using that public IP address and depriving all the other 
computers on the LAN, the hardware or software that you use to share the 
Internet will take control of that public IP address. Then, when any computer 
on your LAN tries to communicate on the Internet, your NAT software/
hardware intercepts your communications and readdresses the traffic so 
that it appears to be coming from your allotted public IP address. (Think of a 
funnel that collects water from several different sources and then directs all 
the water into a single stream.)
When the Web site, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, or whatever strange 
Internet intelligence you’re using on the Internet replies, it replies to your 
NAT device. The NAT device remembers which private IP address it should 
go to on the LAN and sends the information to that computer. See NAT at 
work in Figure 4-1.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
After you have an Internet connection and your LAN is set up, you need 
something to make this NAT thing work. You have two different options to 
take care of NAT for your shared Internet connection: hardware or software. 
(Go figure.) Each has pros and cons, so take a look at each option individually.
 
If you read Chapter 3 of this minibook, you know that Snow Leopard has 
AirPort software built in. So, since you have AirPort Extreme wireless 
hardware built-in on your MacBook and you’re using Snow Leopard, you 
can have your MacBook act like an AirPort Extreme Base Station for all the 
wireless computers on your network, which in turn can use a software NAT.
Using hardware for sharing an Internet connection
Probably the most popular way to share an Internet connection is to buy a 
hardware device that connects to your Internet connection, which then 
connects to your LAN. These devices are referred to as cable/DSL routers. 
The main downside to a hardware Internet connection-sharing device is that 
it costs more than a software solution.

Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
Cable/DSL routers are nice because they’re easy to set up and configure. 
Too, you can leave them on, which means constant Internet access for those 
on your LAN. You don’t have to worry about turning on another computer 
to connect to the Internet as you do with a software solution. Sounds like a 
good spot for a Mark’s Maxim: 
 
Hardware routers are the best choice for sharing your Internet connec-
tion, so if you can afford one, you should get one!
Apple’s AirPort Extreme Base Station is not only a Wireless Access Point 
(WAP) for your network, as I discuss in Chapter 3 of this minibook, but also 
acts as an Internet connection-sharing device. (AirPort Express can’t share 
an Internet connection.) Some older flavors of AirPort Base Station even 
have a built-in v.90 modem for sharing a single 56 Kbps connection using a 
dialup account! A base station typically has several Ethernet connections for 
sharing a high-speed Internet connection, including a dedicated port to 
connect to a cable/DSL router and two or four ports to connect to other 
computers on the LAN.
If you think that a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station could 
be the karma pathway for you to achieve your goal of sharing your Internet 
connection, here are some things to consider when deciding which device to 
buy for your LAN:
 
✦ Do you need a switch? Most cable/DSL routers have a small 3-, 4-, or 
5-port switch built in. See Chapter 1 of this minibook to discover more 
about switches. This multiport capability is nice because the same 
cable/DSL router that shares your Internet connection is also the 
centerpiece of your LAN where all your connections meet, thus saving 
you from having to buy a switch on top of the cost of the cable/DSL 
router.
 
 Some cable/DSL routers, however, have only a single Ethernet connection 
to connect to your LAN. So keep in mind that if you choose a device with 
a single LAN connection, you must supply your own switch that would 
then connect the cable/DSL router to the rest of your LAN.
 
✦ Got modem? If your only Internet connection is through a dial-up 
modem account, look for a built-in analog telephone modem on your 
cable/DSL router. You must have this feature if you want to use a 
hardware device to share your Internet connection. (Again, older versions 
of the AirPort Base Station are great for this because the modem is 
built in, but you’ll have to do some shopping on eBay.) Even if you have 
cable/DSL service, some ISPs also include a dial-up account with your 
broadband access. With such a bountiful selection of connections, you 
can plug in your cable or DSL service to the cable/DSL router as well as 
use the dial-up account as a back-up in case your main service has 
problems.

616
Ways to Share Your Internet Connection
 
✦ Want a printer with that? Some cable/DSL routers also have a port for 
connecting a printer — a great feature to have because it allows you to 
leave the printer connected and turned on so that anyone on the network 
can print to it anytime. (This is much better than connecting the printer 
to a computer and sharing it because then the computer doing the 
sharing must always be on in order to make the printer available.) Mac 
OS X can send a print job to a printer by using Bonjour or TCP/IP, so 
just make sure that your printer is compatible with TCP/IP printing, also 
called LPR (Line Printer Remote).
Using software for sharing an Internet connection
As I mention earlier, your MacBook can act like an AirPort/AirPort Extreme 
Base Station, providing both wireless Ethernet connectivity for other 
computers on the LAN and a shared Internet connection.
Snow Leopard also has built-in software that allows a single computer on 
your network to share its Internet connection with others on the LAN. To 
share your Internet connection, follow these quick steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Sharing icon.
 
3. Click the Internet Sharing entry in the list on the left side of the pane.
 
 This brings up the settings, as shown in Figure 4-2.
 
4. Click the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu and choose 
Ethernet.
 
5. Select the Ethernet check box (in the To Computers Using list) to 
enable it.
 
 When you do, you’re issued a warning that enabling this could affect 
your ISP or violate your agreement with your ISP. In my experiences, this 
step has never caused any networking problems. However, if you have 
any doubts, contact your ISP and verify this.
 
6. Click OK in the warning dialog to continue.
 
 You go back to the Sharing dialog, where you’ll notice that the Internet 
Sharing check box is conveniently ready for you to select it — feel free 
to click it now.
If you’re using a dial-up modem to access the Internet, you need to also 
make sure that the computer that has the modem also has an Ethernet or 
wireless LAN connection. Unfortunately, MacBook models don’t have a 
built-in modem, but if you buy an external USB modem from Apple (or a 
third-party vendor), you can still use this feature.

Connecting Everything for Wired Sharing
 
Figure 4-2:

If you’re using a cable or DSL modem for your Internet connection, the Mac 
that you want to run the sharing software on should have two Ethernet 
connections: one to connect to the cable/DSL modem and one to connect to 
the rest of the LAN.
The main disadvantage to using a software solution for Internet connection 
sharing is that the computer that connects to the Internet must be turned 
on and ready to go all the time so that others on the network can get to the 
Internet. And although the sharing software operates in the background on 
the machine it’s running on, it still chews up some of the Mac’s processing 
power and memory, so it could slow down other applications that you’re 
running on that computer.
Connecting Everything for Wired Sharing
After you decide whether to use a software or hardware solution, it’s time 
to get your hands dirty: All the pieces of the puzzle must be set up and 
connected. In this section, I tell you how to connect things for either the 
software or hardware method of sharing the Internet connection.
Using the software method
When you use the software method to share your Internet connection, one 
of the computers on your network has both the connection to the Internet 
and a connection to the LAN. Figure 4-3 shows a typical setup for software 
Internet sharing, whether you’re using a dial-up modem account or a cable/
DSL modem for your Internet connection.

Keep in mind, though, that when using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet 
connection, the computer running the sharing software must have two 
Ethernet connections.
Using the hardware method
Not only does using a dedicated piece of hardware free one of the Macs on 
your network from the onerous job of hosting the shared connection, but it 
also keeps you from having to have more than one Ethernet connection on a 
single computer if you’re using a cable/DSL modem for your Internet access. 
Figure 4-4 shows how you would connect your devices for hardware Internet

Connecting Everything for Wired Sharing
sharing by using either a cable/DSL router with a built-in Ethernet switch or 
a cable/DSL router with a stand-alone Ethernet switch, as you would need to 
use AirPort or AirPort Extreme.
If you choose to buy a cable/DSL router that has a built-in Ethernet switch, 
you can simply connect all your computers on the LAN to the built-in switch. 
However, if you buy a cable/DSL router that has only a single LAN connection, 
as with older versions of the AirPort Base Station, you must connect that 
single LAN connection to an external hub or switch in order to get all the 
computers on the same network.

Adding Wireless Support
 
We’re talking wired Ethernet here — of course, wireless connections don’t 
require a port on your router or base station. (More on this in the next section.)
 
Regardless of whether you use the hardware or software method to share 
your Internet connection, all the computers on your LAN — except the 
one that’s doing the sharing, if you’re using software sharing — should be 
configured to obtain its IP address automatically through our old friend, 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). (See Chapter 1 of this 
minibook for details on how to do this in Snow Leopard.) Although it’s not a 
requirement that you set up your other devices with DHCP, it’s recommended 
unless you understand the IP addressing scheme required by your cable/
DSL router and you’re willing to set up the addresses manually. You need to 
follow the instructions that come with the cable/DSL router or software that 
you purchase for detailed information on how to configure that.
Adding Wireless Support
You might have noticed that I mention wireless here and there in this 
chapter. This section covers in a bit more detail how you can add wireless 
capabilities to your shared Internet party. To discover more about how 
wireless networks work and how to set up one, see Book VII, Chapter 3.
Basically, you can encounter a couple of situations when trying to add 
wireless capabilities into the mix. Either you already have an Internet 
connection-sharing mechanism in place (either hardware or software), or 
you don’t yet have your Internet connection shared.
If you already have a cable/DSL router or 
are using software Internet sharing
If you already have a cable/DSL router or if you’re using software Internet 
sharing, like that built into Snow Leopard, you can simply buy a WAP (short 
for Wireless Access Point) and connect it to your LAN. Adding a WAP enables 
anyone using wireless Ethernet access to your network and thus to your 
shared Internet connection.
There are many WAPs that you can buy to add wireless to your network. 
AirPort Extreme is a good example; however, because AirPort Extreme also 
can do Internet sharing, make sure that you don’t enable Internet sharing 
through software on your MacBook! (In this case, you don’t want or need 
this feature because it can conflict with your cable/DSL router operation.)

Book VII
Chapter 4
Sharing That

621
Adding Wireless Support
If you do not have a cable/DSL router or 
an AirPort Extreme Base Station
If you don’t have a cable/DSL router or an AirPort Extreme Base Station for 
Internet sharing, you have a few options. Each option has an upside and a 
downside.
One option is to get an AirPort Extreme Base Station, which provides both 
wireless access for AirPort-enabled wireless computers and Internet sharing 
for the entire network. Because today’s AirPort Extreme Base Stations also 
feature three built-in Ethernet ports for wired connections, you won’t need 
an additional switch to connect up to three Macs using Ethernet cables.
The other option is to buy a combination cable/DSL router, which has a 
built-in WAP. Most cable/DSL routers — including the ones that have 
wireless built in — also have multiple Ethernet ports on them, so connecting 
computers by using wired Ethernet can be done without buying an external 
switch.
The final option is that you can use the AirPort software built into Snow 
Leopard to turn your MacBook into an Airport/AirPort Extreme Base Station, 
as I discuss earlier. This is a great, low-cost way to add wireless and Internet 
sharing to your network, but remember that the software will still eat up 
processor time and memory. For more on wireless networking, read Chapter 
3 of this minibook.

ardware. We love it. To a MacBook power user, new hardware holds 
all the promise of Christmas morning, whether your new toys are 
used for business or for pleasure. We pore over magazines and visit our 
favorite Mac Web sites like clockwork to check on new technology.
These hardware devices don’t come cheap, however, forcing you to make 
the painful decision regarding which new hardware you really need in 
order to accomplish what you want and which hardware is a luxury. Also, 
if you’re a new MacBook owner, you might not know what’s available. For 
example, I constantly get e-mail from readers, asking, “What can I connect 
to my new computer?” I guess I could reply, “Why, the kitchen sink!” To that 
end, I decided to add this chapter to the book to let you know how you can 
expand the hardware for your mobile Mac OS X Snow Leopard powerhouse.
Each section in this chapter provides a description of what a particular 
device does, an idea of how much it costs, and a set of general guidelines 
that you can use when shopping. Although this isn’t in-depth coverage — 
after all, the book is supposed to be about your laptop — it will serve to 
get you started if you’ve just become a MacBook owner. If you’re especially 
interested in a specific piece of hardware, I recommend other books that 
you can read for the exhaustive details.
Ready? To quote a great line from the first Batman film: “Alfred, let’s go 
shopping!”

Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, 
DV Camcorders, and Scanners
The first category of hardware toys revolves around images — hardware for 
creating original images, capturing images in real time, and reading images 
from hard copy.
Digital cameras
A digital camera shares most of the characteristics of a traditional film 
camera. It looks the same, and you use the same techniques while shooting 
photographs. The difference is in the end result. With a digital camera, 
instead of a roll of film that has to be developed, you have an image in JPEG, 
RAW, or TIFF format that’s stored on a memory card. The contents of the 
memory card can be downloaded to your MacBook from within iPhoto 
(which I discuss with great pleasure in Book IV, Chapter 3) and then the real 
fun begins. Here are some things that you can do with a digital photograph:
 
✦ Edit it with an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop Elements
 
✦ Print it with an inkjet, dye-sublimation, thermal-transfer or color laser 
printer
 
✦ Record it to a CD or DVD
 
✦ Add it to a Web page
 
✦ Print several of them in a coffee-table book (using iPhoto)
 
✦ Mail it to friends and family
What they cost
Consumer-level digital cameras typically sell for anywhere from under $100 
(for a 7-megapixel [MP] model) to $300 (for a 10 to 12-MP point-and-shoot 
camera). Megapixel is a general reference to the resolution (the size of the 
image, measured in individual dots called pixels) and detail delivered by the 
camera. Such digital cameras can produce photographs that are well suited 
for just about any casual shutterbug. Professional digital cameras, which 
capture far more detail and offer designs that more closely resemble the 
best SLR film camera, can set you back $600 or more. Because of their 
cost and complexity, I wouldn’t recommend them to someone who’s just 
discovered digital photography.
What to look for
Here are some general guidelines that I recommend when selecting a digital 
camera:

Book VIII
Chapter 1
Hardware That Will 
Make You Giddy
627
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
 
✦ At least a 7MP camera: As a general rule, the higher the megapixel 
value, the better the camera.
 
✦ At least a 1GB internal memory card: The memory card stores the 
images that you capture.
 
✦ A Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.0 connection to your MacBook: I cover 
USB in all its glory in Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
✦ An optical zoom feature: Optical zoom allows you to draw closer to 
subjects that are farther away.
 
 Note that I recommended optical zoom there and not digital zoom. 
Essentially, digital zoom is a silly feature that simply resizes a portion 
of your image, providing a blocky close-up. In fact, an image editor like 
Photoshop Elements can produce exactly the same result as a camera 
with digital zoom . . . and it looks almost as bad. Only an optical zoom 
results in a sharper magnification of the subject.
 
✦ A self-timer: With a self-timer, your camera can snap a photo 
automatically, allowing you to finally be seen in your own pictures!
 
✦ A manual flash setting: Although automatic flash is a good thing most 
of the time, a manual setting allows you to disable your camera’s flash 
for artistic shots (or just to prevent the glare on subjects with polished 
surfaces).
DV camcorders
Like digital cameras, digital video (DV) camcorders are the counterpart to 
the familiar video camcorder. A DV camcorder looks and operates like an 
analog VHS camcorder, but you can connect it to your laptop via a FireWire 
(for miniDV-tape camcorders) or USB cable (for mass-storage camcorders) 
and download your video clips directly into iMovie. Today’s crop of DV 
camcorders can also record in High Definition (HD for short) for your 
widescreen TV or monitor. (Chapter 4 of Book IV explains all about iMovie, 
and both FireWire and USB are tackled in Chapter 3 of this minibook.)
Besides the higher quality of digital video, it has a number of other real 
advantages over analog video:
 
✦ Digital video can be edited with applications such as iMovie or Final Cut 
Express.
 
✦ Digital video can be recorded to a CD or DVD.
 
✦ Digital video can be posted for downloading on a Web page.
What they cost
A typical DV camcorder starts at about $200, including camcorders that 
record directly to a blank DVD and record in HD.

628
Parading Pixels: Digital Cameras, DV Camcorders, and Scanners
What to look for
I recommend the following when shopping for a DV camcorder:
 
✦ The highest optical zoom in your price range: Again, as with a digital 
camera, it’s important to be able to capture subjects and action when 
you can’t get any closer — think the lion exhibit at the zoo.
 
✦ Image stabilization: This helps steady the picture when you’re holding 
the camcorder without a tripod.
 
✦ Onboard effects: These effects generally include some snazzy things like 
black-and-white footage, fades, and wipes.
 
✦ AV connectors: Use these to display your video by connecting the 
camcorder directly to your TV.
 
✦ Digital still mode: This enables you to take still photographs if your 
digital camera isn’t handy; however, the image quality isn’t as good as a 
bona fide digital camera.

new iMovie ’09 and iDVD ’09 For Dummies by Dennis R. Cohen and Michael E. 
Cohen (Wiley).
Scanners
Figure 1-1 illustrates a typical flatbed scanner, which is the tool of choice for 
those Macintosh owners who want to digitize images and text from printed 
materials. Although you can also connect a sheet-fed scanner, flatbed 
models are much more versatile and produce better-quality scans.
 
Figure 1-1:

scanner, 
King of 
Digitizing.
 
Images produced by a scanner can be edited, mailed, displayed on the Web, 
or added to your own documents, just as the images from a digital camera 
can be.

Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
What they cost
A good-quality scanner should cost anywhere from $50–$300, with the best 
models — featuring the fastest scanning speeds, best color depth, and 
highest resolutions, or those meant for scanning film negatives — going for 
around $500.
What to look for
Try to get the following features in a scanner:
 
✦ The highest color depth that you can afford: Get a minimum of 48-bit.
 
✦ The highest resolution that you can afford: Get a minimum of 2400 dots 
per inch (dpi) (optical).
 
✦ Single-pass scanning: This feature results in a faster scan with less 
chance of error.
 
✦ Transparency adapter for scanning film negatives: If you’re a traditional 
film photographer, you’ll find that a transparency adapter turns a 
standard flatbed scanner into an acceptable negative scanner.
 
✦ One-touch buttons for e-mailing your scanned images or uploading 
them to the Web: These are controls of convenience — pressing one of 
these buttons automatically scans the item and prepares the image to 
be e-mailed or uploaded to a Web site.
 
✦ USB 2.0 or FireWire connection: I cover the advantages of both in 
Chapter 3 of this minibook.
 
Another shameless (but good-natured) plug: My bestselling book Scanners 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley) offers comprehensive coverage of all 
types of scanners, as well as chapters devoted to advanced features, image 
editing, and step-by-step projects.
Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, 
Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
Although your MacBook is already equipped with a keyboard and a trackpad, 
you can supplement them with enhanced hardware that will add functionality 
and precision to your work. (Or you can buy a joystick and spend your days 
wreaking havoc on your enemies.)

Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
Keyboards
If you want to add an external keyboard to your system, you can take 
advantage of the convenience of a USB keyboard like the one in Figure 1-2.
 
Figure 1-2: 
An 
ergonomic 
upgrade — 
the after-
market USB 
keyboard.
 
What they cost
Aftermarket (nonstandard-issue) keyboards generally cost anywhere from 
$30–$100.
What to look for
Look for the following keyboard features when shopping for a keyboard:
 
✦ Programmable buttons: Configure these to launch applications or run 
macros.
 
✦ Additional USB ports: Use these to turn your keyboard into a USB hub.
 
✦ Numeric keypad: A true numeric keypad cluster makes entering 
numbers far faster and more accurate.
 
✦ One-touch buttons to launch your browser or e-mail application: Press 
one of these buttons to launch your Web browser or Mail.
 
✦ Ergonomic wrist pad: Use these to help prevent wrist strain and 
repetitive joint injuries.
Trackballs
Some folks prefer using a trackball, like the one shown in Figure 1-3, over 
a trackpad any day . . . even the Mighty Mouse that Apple sells separately. 
Graphic artists find that trackballs are more precise and offer better control,

What they cost
Trackballs range in price from $20–$90. Most are optical (see the following 
section), so they need little cleaning, and they’ll last for many years of 
precise pointing at things.
What to look for
Look for the following features when shopping for a trackball:
 
✦ More programmable buttons: Opt for at least two buttons!
 
✦ Optical tracking: An optical trackball — one that doesn’t use rollers, 
instead using a photosensitive sensor to record the movement of the 
ball — is more precise and easier to keep clean.
 
✦ A scroll wheel: Use this gizmo to scroll documents up and down.
 
✦ Ergonomic design: Look for a wrist pad or slanted buttons.

Joysticks
Game players, unite! For arcade and sports games, using a joystick results 
in increased maneuverability, more realistic action, higher scores, less wear 
and tear on your keyboard . . . and just plain more fun. Joysticks range from 
the traditional USB aircraft controller, as shown in Figure 1-4, to USB con-
trollers and gamepads that rival anything offered on today’s console game 
machines.

Joysticks vary in price from $30–$120. At the low end, you’ll usually find the 
gamepad-type controllers, whereas aircraft controllers carry the highest 
price tag.
What to look for
Get the following features in a joystick:
 
✦ Yet even more programmable buttons.
 
✦ Pitch and yaw controls. These are for the flight simulator crowd.
 
✦ Force feedback. A force feedback joystick or gamepad rumbles and 
moves in tandem with the action in the game, providing an extra feeling 
of realism.

Incredible Input: Keyboards, Trackballs, Joysticks, and Drawing Tablets
Drawing tablets
A drawing tablet like the one you see in Figure 1-5 might be pricey, but if 
you’re a graphic artist or a designer, using a tablet will revolutionize the way 
that you work with your MacBook. Rather than using your finger on your 
trackpad to sketch, you can draw on the tablet freehand, just as you would 
draw on paper or canvas. Tablets can recognize different levels of pressure, 
allowing applications, such as Photoshop and Painter, to re-create all sorts 
of photo-realistic brush effects.

What they cost
Depending on the size of the tablet and the pressure levels that you need, 
you’ll pay anywhere from just under $100 to a whopping $500 (or even 
higher).
What to look for
I recommend the following tablet features:
 
✦ Programmable buttons: See a trend here?
 
✦ Accessory mouse: Some high-end tablets include a mouse that you can 
use along with the tablet.
 
✦ A cordless stylus: Make sure that it doesn’t require batteries.

Sublime Storage: DVD/Blu-Ray Recorders
 
✦ The highest number of pressure levels possible: The more levels that 
the tablet offers, the more subtle and precise your control is over 
painting effects.
Sublime Storage: DVD/Blu-Ray Recorders
Ready to talk storage? Consider a rewriteable DVD-RW drive which can store 
4.7GB on a single disc, or dual-layer drives, which can store 8.5GB! (And 
don’t even get me started on the latest generation of optical technology — 
the Blu-ray recorders — they can store 50GB on a single disc!)
 
At the time of this writing, adding an external Blu-ray recorder to your 
MacBook doesn’t always mean that you can watch Blu-ray movies, because 
the digital copyright protection on Blu-ray discs can block playback on many 
computer graphics cards. Check with the manufacturer of your external 
drive to see whether it can be used to watch Blu-ray movie discs on your 
MacBook. Of course, you can always use your Blu-ray drive for recording 
data discs and backups.
 
If you’d like to trade data with another Mac or a PC via floppy disks, you can 
get an external USB floppy drive for under $50; however, I personally eschew 
floppy disks, which are very unreliable and carry a mere 1.44MB of data. Pick 
up a USB Flash drive instead.
All recent MacBook models (except the MacBook Air) include a rewriteable 
DVD-RW SuperDrive — but if your computer is older and didn’t come 
equipped with a recorder (or you want the latest Blu-ray storage capacity), 
you can always add an external model.
What they cost
A USB DVD-RW drive averages about $100.
What to look for
Get the following features in an external DVD recorder:
 
✦ An internal buffer of at least 8MB: The larger the buffer, the less 
chance that you’ll encounter recording errors and the faster your drive 
will burn.
 
✦ At least 16X DVD recording speed: A no-brainer here. The faster the 
recording speed, the less time you’ll wait for the finished disc.
 
✦ AC power through the USB 2.0 or FireWire cable: This eliminates the 
need for a separate AC power supply.

Awesome Audio: Subwoofer Systems 
and MP3 Hardware
Although all MacBooks ship with speakers, I’ll be honest — the “stock” 
speakers don’t measure up to the standards of a true audiophile. For those 
who really enjoy their music and their game audio, this last section covers 
the world of Macintosh aftermarket sonic enjoyment.
Subwoofer speaker systems
The ever-popular USB port again comes to your rescue. This time, it enables 
you to connect a more powerful speaker system with a subwoofer. In case 
you’ve never heard a subwoofer — think chest-rattling thump, thump, 
thump — you should know that they provide the basement-level bass that 
can add power and punch to both your music and your games. Being hit by 
an asteroid is a rather flat, tinny experience with a pair of battery-powered 
speakers that you salvaged from your Walkman years ago. With a new set of 
speakers and a subwoofer, you’ll swear that Han Solo is sitting in the cockpit 
chair next to you!
With the growing importance of the computer as a replacement for your 
home entertainment center, investing in a more powerful set of speakers 
will help you enjoy all those audio CDs and MP3s that you’ve added to your 
iTunes Playlists. (Read all about iTunes in Book IV, Chapter 2.)
What they cost
Most USB-powered speakers with a subwoofer are priced below $100, but 
true audiophiles looking for surround sound can spring for a better $300 
system that includes five satellite speakers and a subwoofer.
What to look for
Get these features in a subwoofer:
 
✦ At least 30 watts of power: The higher the wattage rating, the more 
powerful the speakers (and the louder your music can be).
 
✦ Additional headphone jacks and stereo mini-plug input jacks: Use 
these for connecting your iPod or MP3 player directly to your speaker 
system. (Read all about iPods in the next section.)

✦ Magnetic shielding: This helps prevent your speakers from distorting 
your monitor display.
MP3 players (well, actually, just the iPod)
I’ve lusted after Apple’s iPod MP3 player ever since it arrived on campus. 
Depending on which model you get, this incredible device can hold up to 
120GB of digital audio — that’s over 30,000 songs — as well as digital 
photographs and full-length movies! Plus, the iPod also acts as your personal 
data butler by carrying your files; it’s an honest-to-goodness, external USB 
2.0 hard drive. In fact, if you pick up an iPod Shuffle, it acts as a USB Flash 
drive. You can download your contacts and appointments from Mac OS X 
and view them wherever you go. Just think: Carry your files to and from 
your office and carry DEVO and the Dead Kennedys and watch a movie you 
downloaded as well! Oh, and did I mention that you can play games and use 
all sorts of applications with the iPod Touch model?
All this fits into a beautiful, stylish package about the size of a pack of 
cigarettes, with up to a 36-hour lithium rechargeable battery, high-quality 
earbud headphones, and automatic synchronization with your iTunes music 
library. (The iPod Shuffle is the smallest member of the iPod family — it’s 
less than 2 inches tall.) Life just doesn’t get any better for a technoid like me. 
If you think that your MacBook is a well-designed piece of equipment, you’ll 
understand why this little box is so alluring. (And why I have one now.)
Sure, other MP3 players are out there, but many of them have the same 
problems, as follows:
 
✦ They use digital memory cards, which offer far less capacity than the 
iPod.
 
✦ They use standard batteries, or you have to furnish rechargeable 
batteries (which don’t last 36 hours).
 
✦ They don’t operate as an external hard drive, photo slideshow repository, 
movie theater, or contacts/appointment database.
I say forget ’em. The iPod is worth every cent that you’ll pay.
The 4GB iPod Shuffle is less than $80 at the time of this writing, while the 
8GB iPod nano runs $149 and the 120GB iPod video model costs $249.

M
ost MacBook owners will make two upgrades — adding more 
memory (RAM) and additional hard drive space — during the lifetime 
of their computers. These two improvements have the greatest effect on the 
overall performance of Mac OS X. By adding RAM and additional hard drive 
space, not only do you make more elbow room for your applications and 
documents, but everything runs faster: Think of the Six Million Dollar Man, 
only a heck of a lot cheaper to operate (and no strange noises accompanying 
your every move).
In this chapter, I steer you around the hidden potholes along the way for 
those who aren’t well versed in selecting memory modules or weighing the 
advantages of different types of hard drives. However, if you buy the wrong 
piece of hardware, remember that using a hammer to make it fit is not a 
workable option.
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
Of all the possible upgrades that you can make to your MacBook, adding 
more random access memory (RAM) is the single most cost-effective 
method of improving the performance of Mac OS X. (In fact, your machine 
will likely run faster with more memory than a reasonably faster processor!) 
Here is exactly what Mac OS X uses available RAM for:
 
✦ Applications: Naturally, Mac OS X needs system RAM to run the 
applications that you launch. The more memory in your machine, the 
larger the applications that you can open and the faster they’ll run.

638
Adding Memory: Reasons for More RAM
 
✦ Overhead: This includes the operating system itself, as well as various 
and sundry buffers and memory areas devoted for temporary work. As 
you would guess, the more memory here, the merrier.
 
✦ Virtual memory: Aha! Now here’s something that I mention lightly and 
politely in Book II but hasn’t really amounted to a hill of beans until this 
moment. (Can you tell I’m a big fan of Bing Crosby?) Virtual memory 
allows Mac OS X to use empty hard drive space as temporary system 
memory, as shown in Figure 2-1. Data is written to your hard drive 
instead of being stored in RAM, and then it’s erased when it’s no longer 
needed. This is a neat trick that’s also used by Windows and Linux. 
Virtual memory works automatically within Mac OS X.

At first, virtual memory sounds like absolute bliss, and it does indeed allow 
your MacBook to do things that would otherwise be impossible, such as 
running an application that requires 4GB of RAM in just 2GB of actual 
physical RAM. However, here come the caveats:
 
✦ Virtual memory is as slow as molasses in December. Even today’s fastest 
hard drive is many, many times slower than real silicon, so any use of 
virtual memory instead RAM slows down Mac OS X significantly.
 
✦ Virtual memory abuses your hard drive. If you’ve ever run Photoshop 
on a Windows PC with 128MB of RAM, you’re having flashbacks right 
now. Whenever your MacBook is using virtual memory, your hard drive 
remains almost constantly active. (Hardware types, like myself, call this 
phenomenon thrashing because we know what’s happening inside that 
poor hard drive.) Over time, running any computer with insufficient 
RAM and behemoth applications will result in a significant increase in 
hard drive wear and tear.
 
✦ Virtual memory costs you processing power. With sufficient RAM, Mac 
OS X gleefully runs as efficiently as it can. When virtual memory kicks in, 
however, your MacBook has to spend part of its quality time shuttling 
data to and from the hard drive, which robs your computer of processing 
power.

Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
The moral of the story is very simple, so it’s time for another of Mark’s 
Maxims:
 
The less Mac OS X needs to use virtual memory, the better.
To put it another way, physical memory (meaning memory modules) is 
always a better choice than virtual memory. This is why power users and 
techno-types crave as much system memory as possible.
 
A little over five years ago, 256MB of RAM was a quite comfortable figure for 
most folks, but almost all of today’s MacBooks can accept at least a whopping 
4GB (that’s short for gigabyte, or 1,024 megabytes) of system RAM. (The 
exception to this rule is the MacBook Air, which comes with 2GB of RAM and 
can’t be expanded.)
If you’ll be keeping your current MacBook for a few years more, install as 
much memory as you can afford — you’ll thank me every time Mac OS X 
Snow Leopard boots.
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
Before you click some online computer store’s Buy button, you need to 
determine two things that will help you determine which memory module to 
buy: how much RAM you already have and how much more your system can 
handle.
Finding out the current memory in your MacBook
Memory modules are made in standard sizes, so you need to determine 
how much memory you already have and which of your memory slots are 
filled. To do this, open the Apple System Profiler by clicking the Apple menu, 
choosing About This Mac, and then clicking the More Info button.
After you launch this application, it takes a few seconds to scan your laptop 
and display all sorts of identifying information about the hardware and 
software that you’re using. Check out the Memory item in the Hardware 
section. Here you can see exactly how many memory modules you have, 
what type they are, and how much memory each provides. For example, in 
Figure 2-2, this machine has two memory slots — labeled Bank0/DIMM0 and 
Bank1/DIMM1. Both those slots are filled to the brim with a 1GB module 
each, giving me a total physical memory of 2048MB, or 2GB. Jot down the 
name and contents of each slot on a piece of paper — or, if you’re a real 
Mac OS X power user, add a Sticky to your Desktop with this information. 
(Stickies are covered in Book III, Chapter 2.)

640
Shopping for a RAM Upgrade
 
Figure 2-2: 
Look under 
the hood 
with Apple’s 
System 
Profiler.
 
However, on some machines, only one memory module can be upgraded 
by a mere mortal. For example, on many older Mac laptops, DIMM0 is an 
internal module and can be upgraded only by an Apple technician. (Insert 
sound of harps playing here.)
Unfortunately, this arrangement differs on just about every model of 
Macintosh ever made — some have more memory slots, and others allow 
you to upgrade all the system memory instead of just one module. The only 
way to determine which modules are accessible on your MacBook is to 
identify the exact model of your laptop.
Determining the exact model of your laptop
Most folks know the type and model of their computers, but there’s a catch 
here, too: Sometimes the memory that you need varies by the processor in 
your MacBook. Your eye should be on the actual processor speed and bus 
speed — the transfer speed that data reaches whilst speeding across your 
motherboard — because they’re the identifying factors here.
Again, your salvation turns out to be Apple System Profiler. Just click the 
Hardware section to display both the machine speed (or processor speed) 
and the bus speed. (For example, my machine has a 1.83 GHz Intel Core Duo 
CPU running at 667 MHz bus speed.) Grab that same piece of paper (or open 
that same Sticky) and add these two figures to your list.

The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Now you’re armed with the information that you need to go online and buy 
the right memory — or, if you’d rather work directly with a human being, 
you can visit your local Apple dealer, present that most august personage 
with the list, and have the memory upgrade ordered for you.
 
Buying memory online is much cheaper. I recommend the following online 
stores:
 
✦ MacMall: www.macmall.com
 
✦ MacWarehouse: www.cdw.com
 
✦ MacConnection: www.macconnection.com
The Tao of Hard Drive Territory
Next, turn your attention to the other popular MacBook upgrade — adding 
extra hard drive space. With today’s cutting-edge, 3-D games using a gigabyte 
of space each and Photoshop CS4 expanding to a minimum of 2GB, IDC 
(short for Insidious Data Creep) is a growing problem. (Bad pun most 
certainly intended.)
You can save space by deleting those files and folders you don’t need, but 
what fun is that? To reduce your MacBook’s waistline before you consider 
adding more room, I recommend using Spring Cleaning from Smith Micro 
Software, which you can find at mysmithmicro.com. It’s a great tool for 
locating duplicates, removing empty folders, and uninstalling old programs 
that you no longer use.
To determine how much free space remains on a hard drive, click the drive’s 
icon on your Desktop and press Ô+I to display its information, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. (I’m a major-league Mozart fan-boy, hence the name of my hard 
drive.)
As a general rule, the following factors indicate that you’re ready to upgrade 
your hard drive territory:
 
✦ You have less than 10GB of space on your current hard drive.
 
✦ You’ve cleaned all unnecessary files, and your MacBook is still lagging 
behind in storage.
 
✦ You need to share a large amount of data between computers that aren’t 
on the same network. (Read on to discover why.)

642
Internal versus External Storage
 
Figure 2-3: 
Checking 
your drive’s 
free space.
 
Internal versus External Storage
Most people who upgrade their existing hard drive do so because they 
need extra space; however, you might also need to add a hard drive to your 
system that can go mobile whenever necessary. Unlike an internal drive — 
which resides hidden inside your MacBook’s case — an external drive is a 
lean, mean, self-contained traveling storage machine that’s perfect for road 
warriors.
External drives
 
External removable cartridge drives, such as a REV drive from Iomega 
(www.iomega.com), are perfect for folks who have to send cartridges to 
other locations. Unfortunately, however, the capacities of these drives are 
rapidly falling behind conventional, nonremovable external hard drives. 
Also, all MacBooks now have an internal DVD-R drive (except for the 
MacBook Air), which make it easy to send up to 9GB of data through the 
mail. Therefore, if you’re considering an external unit, go with the most 
popular pick — a high-capacity nonremovable hard drive, which offers the 
most storage for your dollar.
Most external drives are shock-mounted (meaning that they can take more 
abuse than an internal hard drive), and they carry their own power supply. 
In fact, some external drives actually don’t need a separate power supply 
because they draw their power through your MacBook’s Universal Serial 
Bus (USB) or FireWire port. (The next chapter in this minibook tells all 
about USB and FireWire.) You can also use a superfast external SATA drive 
with a MacBook Pro if you invest in a SATA card adapter for your laptop’s 
ExpressCard/34 slot.

643
Internal versus External Storage
External drives also have a number of other advantages:
 
✦ No installation hassle: You can easily install a USB or FireWire drive 
in seconds. Simply plug in the drive to the proper connector on your 
MacBook, connect the power supply (if necessary), and turn it on. (No 
software installation necessary. As the folks in Cupertino are fond of 
saying, “Look, Ma — no drivers!”)
 
✦ No extra space needed: Naturally, MacBooks simply don’t have the 
internal space for another drive. Therefore, if you want to keep your 
existing internal drive as-is while you’re adding more storage, an 
external drive is your only choice.
 
✦ File sharing with ease: With an external drive, you can easily share your 
data between multiple Macs, even if they’re not connected over a network.
 
✦ Safe from prying eyes: Unlike an internal drive, external drives can 
be secured in a different spot, away from your MacBook. Take your 
sensitive information home with you or lock it in a safe.
After you plug in an external drive, Mac OS X displays it just like any other 
hard drive volume. Figure 2-4 illustrates my 60GB FireWire drive in action.

644
Determining How Much Space You Need
Internal drives
Your other alternative is to upgrade your internal drive, which can be a 
hassle. As does a memory upgrade, adding or swapping an internal drive 
involves opening your MacBook’s case. In fact, it’s a somewhat more 
complex procedure than adding memory.
 
I usually recommend that folks add a second drive rather than swap out 
their existing drive. You’ll avoid the hassle of backing up and restoring your 
system on a new drive or (even worse) reinstalling Mac OS X and then 
reinstalling all the applications that you use. (Swapping a hard drive should 
be the definition of the word hassle.) Instead, add a second drive and leave 
your current hard drive as is (or if you’re already using an external drive as 
a Time Machine backup, add a second external drive).
However, here are a number of very important reasons why many MacBook 
owners choose updating internal drives, even with the hassle of swapping:
 
✦ They’re cheaper. You’ll spend significantly less on an internal drive 
because it doesn’t need the case and additional electronics required by 
an external drive.
 
✦ They’re faster. Even a FireWire or USB 2.0 drive isn’t as fast as an 
internal drive.
 
✦ They take up less space in your work area. An internal drive eliminates 
the space taken by an external drive, which can range anywhere from 
the size of a paperback to the size of a hardback book.
After you establish that you are in fact ready for more space — and you’ve 
decided whether you want to add an internal drive, an external drive, or (if 
you enjoy punishment) upgrade your existing internal drive — you’re ready 
to consider how big of a drive you need.
Determining How Much Space You Need
Your next step is to decide just how much hard drive space is enough. I 
suppose that if your last name is Gates and you had something to do with 
that Windows thing, you can probably pick just about any drive on the 
market. However, I have a family, a mortgage, a car payment, and lust in 
my heart for the latest computer games; therefore, I must be a little more 
selective.
I have two hard-and-fast rules that I follow when I’m determining the 
capacity of a new drive:

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Add RAM, Hard 
Drive Space, and 
Stir
645
Shopping for a Hard Drive
 
1. If you’re buying a replacement for your existing drive, shop for a drive 
with at least twice the capacity of the existing drive (if possible).
 
2. If you’re buying an external drive, shop for a drive with at least the same 
capacity as your existing internal drive (if possible).
Those rules seem to work pretty doggone well in most circumstances, with 
these two exceptions: gamers and digital video gurus. These folks need to 
shoehorn as much space as they possibly can into their systems. If you’re 
a hardcore gamer or if you work primarily with digital video, you need a 
wheelbarrow’s worth of hard drive capacity. Trust me: Buy the biggest hard 
drive that you can afford.
Shopping for a Hard Drive
Ready to brave the local Wireless Shed superstore (or perhaps its Web site)? 
Here’s a list of guidelines to keep handy while you’re shopping for a new 
internal or external hard drive:
 
✦ Faster is indeed better. You’ll pay more for a 10,000 revolutions per 
minute (rpm) drive than a slower 5,400 or 7,200 rpm drive, but the extra 
cash is worth it. Faster drives can transfer more data to your MacBook’s 
processor in less time, especially if you’re replacing your MacBook’s 
internal Serial ATA drive.
 
 Faster drives are especially important for storing digital video.
 
✦ Serial ATA and EIDE drives are different. If you’re replacing your 
internal drive, you have to get the same type of drive that you already 
have: EIDE or Serial ATA. (EIDE is a common parallel ATA standard hard 
drive used in PCs and older Macs.) Again, System Profiler can tell you 
which type of drive your MacBook is currently using.
 
✦ Avoid used or refurbished drives. Hard drives are one of the few 
components in your computer that still have a large number of moving 
parts. Therefore, buying a used drive isn’t a good idea unless it’s priced 
very low.
 
 Because the prices on new hard drives are constantly dropping, make 
sure that you check on the price for a new, faster drive of the same 
capacity before you buy that bargain used drive.
 
✦ Pick FireWire over USB. Compared with a FireWire connection, a USB 
2.0 external hard drive is less efficient and slightly slower. Because most 
MacBooks with USB ports also have FireWire ports, make very sure 
that you buy a FireWire drive! (If your Mac has USB 2.0 ports, which will 
show up in System Profiler as well, you can buy a USB 2.0 drive without 
being embarrassed. Or invest in a drive that has both FireWire and USB 
2.0 connectors!)

646
Installing Your New Stuff
 
✦ Watch the size of the drive when buying internal drives. Your 
MacBook’s internal drive must fit in a small form factor, so don’t invest 
in a standard half-height 3.5-inch unit!
 
 Do what I do, and call your local Apple certified technician and verify 
that you’re evaluating the right drive before you spend a dime.
Installing Your New Stuff
After you get your memory modules or hard drive, pick one of two methods 
of installing them: easy or hard. Guess which method will cost you money?
The easy way
Your Apple dealer can perform either type of hardware installation for you. 
You can rest easy knowing that the job will be done right, but money will 
definitely change hands.
 
Personally, I always recommend that owners of MacBook and MacBook Pro 
laptops allow their dealers to install hard drives because these laptops are 
much more complex than a desktop, and they’re much easier to damage.
The hard way
If you’re familiar with the inside of your MacBook, you can install your own 
upgrade and save that cash. A memory upgrade is one of the simpler chores 
to perform, but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels comfortable taking the 
cover off and jumping inside a computer; hard drives are a tad more complex.
 
If you have a knowledgeable friend or family member who can help you 
install your hardware, buy him the proverbial NSD (short for Nice Steak 
Dinner) and enlist him in your cause. Even if you still do the work yourself, 
it’s always better to have a second pair of experienced eyes watching, 
especially if you’re a little nervous.
Because the installation procedures for both memory modules and hard 
drives are different for every model of MacBook, I can’t provide you with 
any step-by-step procedures in this chapter. Many online stores include 
installation instructions with their hardware. Other sources for installation 
instructions include the Apple Web site (www.apple.com) and your Apple 
dealer. You can use Safari’s Google search feature to scan the Internet for 
installation information for your particular model. However, here are 
guidelines to follow during the installation:

Book VIII
Chapter 2
Add RAM, Hard 
Drive Space, and 
Stir
647
Installing Your New Stuff
 
✦ Watch out for static electricity. When opening your MacBook and 
handling hardware, make certain that you’ve touched a metal surface 
beforehand to discharge any static electricity on your body. (You can 
also buy a static wrist strap that you can wear while working within the 
bowels of your Mac.)
 
✦ Check the notches on memory modules. Most types of memory modules 
have notches cut into the connector. These notches make sure that you 
can install the module only one way, so make certain that they align 
properly with the slot.
 
✦ Make sure you’re using the right memory slot. As I mention earlier in 
this chapter, MacBooks have multiple memory slots, so check the label 
on the circuit board to make sure that you’re adding the memory to the 
correct slot. (Naturally, this won’t be a problem if you’re installing a 
module into an unoccupied slot.)
 
✦ Take good care of older hardware. If you replace an existing memory 
module or hard drive with a new one, put the old hardware in the 
leftover anti-static bag from your new hardware and immediately start 
thinking of how you’ll word your eBay auction . . . Used 1GB Memory 
Module for MacBook, for example.
 
To determine whether a memory upgrade was successful, you can again 
turn to the Apple System Profiler. Open the Profiler again and compare the 
memory overview specifications with the original list that you made earlier. 
If the total amount of memory has increased and the memory module is 
recognized, you’ve done your job well. If not, switch off the MacBook and 
check the module to make sure it’s completely seated in the slot.

A
pple’s list of successes continues to grow over the years — hardware,

In this chapter, I discuss the importance of FireWire to the digital hub that I 
discuss in Book III, and I compare it with both version 1.1 and version 2.0 of 
Intel’s Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection technology. I also talk trouble-
shooting and expansion using a hub.
Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
So what’s so special about FireWire, anyway? Why does Apple stuff at 
least one FireWire port in almost all of its current Macintosh models? (The 
MacBook Air is an exception.) Heck, even the iPod (Apple’s MP3 player, 
which you can read more about in Book III, Chapter 2) originally used only a 
FireWire connection. (Its official name is IEEE 1394, but even the Cupertino 
crew doesn’t call it that — at least not very often.)
First things first. As countless racing fans will tell you, it’s all about the 
speed, my friend. The original FireWire 400 port delivers 400 Mbps (megabits 
per second), which is fast enough for all sorts of peripherals to communicate 
with your MacBook. The following list includes a number of hardware toys 
that are well known for transferring prodigious file sizes:

Appreciating the Advantage of a FireWire Connection
 
✦ Digital video (DV) camcorders
 
✦ High-resolution digital cameras
 
✦ Scanners and some printers
 
✦ External hard drives and CD/DVD recorders
 
✦ Networking between computers
For example, consider the sheer size of a typical digital video clip captured 
by one of today’s mini-DV camcorders. DV buffs commonly transfer several 
hundred megabytes of footage to their computers at one time. Check out the 
relative speeds of the different types of ports in Table 3-1, and you’ll see a 
big attraction of FireWire and USB 2.0 connections.

Ouch! Not too hard to figure that one out. Here are three other important 
benefits to FireWire:
 
✦ Control over connection: This is a ten-cent term that engineers use, 
meaning that you can control whatever gadget you’ve connected using 
FireWire from your laptop. This is pretty neat when you think about it; 
for example, you can control your mini-DV camcorder from the comfort 
of your computer keyboard, just as though you were pressing the 
buttons on the camcorder.
 
✦ Hot-swapped: You don’t have to reboot your MacBook Pro or restart 
Mac OS X every time that you plug (or unplug) a FireWire device. 
Instead, the FireWire peripheral is automatically recognized (as long as 
the operating system has the correct driver) and ready to transfer.
 
✦ Power through the port: FireWire can provide power to a device 
through the same wire — typically, enough power is available for an 
external drive or recorder — so you don’t need an external AC power 
cord for some FireWire devices. (Apologies to owners of DV camcorders, 
but those things eat power like a pig eats slop.)

Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
However, FireWire isn’t finished evolving yet — the cleverly named IEEE 
1394 B (called FireWire 800 by anyone with any sense, including the folks 
at Apple) delivers a whopping 800 Mbps. That, dear reader, oughta be fast 
enough for both you and your loved ones. These ports appear on most of the 
top-of-the-line Apple desktop and laptop models at the time of this writing.
Oh, and as you would expect from Apple, the new ports will be backward-
compatible with older FireWire hardware. However, the ports aren’t 
physically exactly the same, so you’ll need a plastic port converter to 
connect FireWire 400 devices to a FireWire 800 port. (Such important little 
conversion fixtures are commonly called dongles. No, I’m not making that up. 
Ask your favorite techno-wizard.)
Understanding USB and the Tale of Two Point Oh
The other resident port on today’s MacBooks is the ubiquitous USB, which is 
short for Universal Serial Bus. (By the way, ubiquitous means ever-present or 
universal, which I quickly looked up by using my Dictionary widget — read 
all about widgets in Book III, Chapter 2.) USB has taken the world by storm. 
It’s used for everything from mice to keyboards, speakers, digital cameras, 
and even external drives and DVD recorders. (A friend of mine never misses 
the chance to point out that USB — which was originally developed by 
Intel, the makers of the Core 2 processor — was given its first widespread 
implementation on the original iMac. You’re welcome, Intel.)
Unfortunately, those last two are somewhat problematical: Technically, you 
can add a USB 1.1 external hard drive, but don’t expect response times 
anywhere near what you’d enjoy with an internal hard drive (think more 
along the lines of a floppy drive). Ditto for a CD recorder — 2X is about the 
limit for the recording speed with a USB 1.1 connection. (Don’t even think 
about recording DVDs over a USB 1.1 connection.) Now, compare this 
performance with that of similar equipment using a FireWire connection, 
which provides nearly the speed of an internal hard drive and CD and DVD 
recording at the fastest pace possible.
As is the case with FireWire, USB connections are hot-swappable and may 
provide power over the connection. (Some USB ports don’t supply all the 
power that devices need — more on this later in this chapter.) A USB port 
offers a more limited version of Control over Connection as well, making it a 
good choice for virtually all digital cameras.
Not to be outdone, a USB 2.0 specification arrived several years ago that 
delivers performance comparable to the original FireWire standard: 
USB 2.0 can transfer 480 Mbps, although far less efficiently than FireWire, so 
the FireWire connection is still faster overall. These ports are backward 
compatible — meaning they work with the original USB 1.1 ports as well. 
(Don’t call Apple a snob . . . at the time of this writing, all the MacBook 
models in Apple’s current stable have USB 2.0 ports.)

652
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Hey, You Need a Hub!
Suppose that you’ve embraced FireWire and USB and you now have two USB 
2.0 drives hanging off the rear end of your laptop — and suddenly you buy 
an iPod. (Or you get another USB device that’s as much fun as an iPod, if 
that’s actually possible.) Now you’re faced with too many devices for too 
few ports. You could eject a drive and unhook it each time that you want to 
connect your iPod, but there must be a more elegant way to connect. Help!
Enter the hub. Both the FireWire and USB specifications allow you to 
connect a device called a hub, which is really nothing more than a glorified 
splitter adapter that provides you with additional ports. With a FireWire or 
USB hub at work, you do lose a port; however, most hubs multiply that port 
into four or eight ports. Again, all this is transparent, and you don’t need to 
hide anything up your sleeve. Adding a hub is just as plug-and-play easy as 
adding a regular FireWire/USB device.
I should also mention that FireWire supports daisy-chaining — a word 
that stretches all the way back to the days of the Atari and Commodore 
computers, when devices had extra ports in the back so that additional stuff 
could be plugged in. However, not every FireWire drive has a daisy-chain 
port (also called a passthru port). With daisy-chaining, you can theoretically 
add 63 FireWire devices (or 127 USB devices) to your MacBook — talk about 
impressing them at your next Mac user group meeting!
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
Man, I hate it when FireWire and USB devices act like boat anchors. FireWire 
and USB peripherals are so doggone simple that when something goes 
wrong, it really aggravates you. Fortunately, I’ve been down those roads 
many a time before, so in this section, I unleash my experience. (That 
sounds a little frightening, but it’s a good thing. Really.)
Common FireWire and USB headaches
Because FireWire and USB are so alike in so many ways, I can handle 
possible troubleshooting solutions for both types of hardware at one time:
 
✦ Problem: Every time I turn off or unplug my external peripheral, Mac 
OS X gets irritated and displays a nasty message saying that I haven’t 
properly disconnected the device.

Book VIII
Chapter 3
Port-o-Rama: Using 
USB and FireWire
653
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
 
 Solution: This happens because you haven’t ejected the peripheral. I 
know that sounds a little strange for a device like an external hard drive 
or a digital camera, but it’s essentially the same reasoning as ejecting 
a CD or DVD from your Desktop. When you click your USB or FireWire 
device and hold the mouse button down, you see that the Trash icon 
turns into an Eject icon; drag the device icon to the Eject icon and drop 
it, and the external device disappears from your Desktop. (You can 
also click the device icon to select it and press Ô+E. And don’t forget 
the right-click menu . . . right-click the device and choose Eject.) At that 
point, you’re safe to turn it off or unplug the FireWire/USB cable.
 
 If Snow Leopard recognizes the device as an external drive, which is 
usually the case with a digital camera, external hard drive, or external 
CD/DVD recorder, you can simply click the Eject button next to the 
device icon in the Finder window’s sidebar.
 
✦ Problem: The device doesn’t show a power light.
 
 Solution: Check to make sure that the power cable is connected — 
unless, of course, you have a device that’s powered through the 
connection itself. This can sometimes pose its own share of problems, 
however, when using USB devices. Not all USB ports provide power 
to devices because some are designed only for connecting mice, 
keyboards, and joysticks.
 
 To check whether an unpowered USB port is your problem, either 
connect the device to a USB port on your MacBook or connect it to a 
hub or another computer. If the device works when it’s connected to 
another port, you’ve found the culprit.
 
✦ Problem: The device shows a power light but just doesn’t work.
 
 Solution: This can be because of problems with your cable or your hub. 
To check, borrow a friend’s cables and test to see whether the device 
works. If you’re testing the hub, try connecting the device directly to 
your MacBook using the same cable to see whether it works without 
the hub.
 
 If you’re attempting to connect a FireWire device through another 
FireWire device, try connecting that first device directly to see whether 
it works. If so, the middleman device either needs to be switched on to 
pass the data through or it doesn’t support daisy-chaining at all — in 
which case, you may be able to place the “problem” device at the end of 
the chain. Of course, you can always connect both devices directly to 
your laptop as well.

654
Uh, It’s Just Sitting There
 
✦ Problem: Mac OS X reports that I have a missing driver.
 
 Solution: Check the manufacturer’s Web site and download a new copy 
of the USB or FireWire drivers for your device because they’ve been 
corrupted, overwritten, or erased entirely. Because Mac OS X loads the 
driver for a USB or FireWire device when it’s connected, sometimes just 
unplugging and reconnecting a peripheral will do the trick.
Check those drivers
Speaking of drivers . . . old and worn-out drivers are a sore spot with me. 
Drivers are simply programs that tell Mac OS X how to communicate with 
your external device. Each new version of Mac OS X contains updated 
drivers, but make certain that you check for new updates on a regular basis. 
That means using both the Software Update feature in Mac OS X (which I 
cover in Book II, Chapter 7) and going to the Web sites provided by your USB 
and FireWire hardware manufacturers.

Chapter 4: I’m Okay, 
You’re a Printer
In This Chapter
✓ Adding a local printer
✓ Adding a non-USB printer
✓ Managing print jobs
✓ Sending and receiving faxes
✓ Setting up a shared printer
O
f all the improvements made in Mac OS X over Mac OS 9, one of the 
most important is the simplified printing process — no Chooser, no 
strange printer ports . . . just a heap of Universal Serial Bus (USB) and network 
and Bluetooth printing goodness. As I discuss in Book II, Chapter 3, if your 
USB printer is recognized by Snow Leopard, you can print within seconds of 
plugging it in, with no muss or fuss. A USB printer is connected physically 
to your MacBook, but you can also send print jobs over the network to a 
network printer or even to a wireless printer. (Unfortunately, if that network 
printer is in another room, you do have to get out of your comfortable chair 
to retrieve your printed document . . . not even Snow Leopard is that powerful.)
But what if you want to send documents to a printer over TCP/IP 
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)? To take care of tasks 
like that, you need to dig a little further — and I do so in this chapter. You 
also discover here how to use the features of the System Preferences Print 
& Fax pane and how to juggle print jobs like a circus performer.
Meet the Printer Browser
The Printer Browser runs automatically whenever it’s needed by Snow 
Leopard, but you can always summon it at any time by clicking the plus sign 
(or Add) button on the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences.
 
If your USB printer is already natively supported (has a preloaded driver in 
Snow Leopard), you might not need to go through the trouble of clicking the 
Add button on the Print & Fax pane. Mac OS X can add a new USB printer 
automatically, so don’t be surprised if your MacBook swoops in and does 
it for you as soon as you plug in a new printer. Also, the manufacturer’s 
installation program for your printer might add the printer for you in a 
behind-the-scenes way, even if Mac OS X lies dormant.

656
Meet the Printer Browser
Although the Printer Browser doesn’t look like much (as shown in 
Figure 4-1), power lurks underneath.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The rather 
plain-
looking 
Printer 
Browser 
is actually 
a rugged 
adventurer.
 
Along the top of the Printer Browser, you’ll find four toolbar icons that will 
display the different types of printer categories possible in Snow Leopard. 
From the Browser, you can add these printers to your system. The four 
buttons are
 
✦ Default: Click this button to add or display the entry for the default 
printer, which always appears in bold type.
 
 To choose a printer you’ve already added as your default printer, click 
the Default Printer pop-up menu in the Print & Fax pane and choose 
that printer. You can also choose the Last Printer Used option, which 
automatically makes the default printer the last printer you used.
 
✦ Fax: If you have an external USB fax device, click this button to add 
a fax connection as a printer selection. If you don’t want to use Snow 
Leopard’s built-in faxing system, you can print directly to a third-party 
fax program, such as FAXstf Pro (www.smithmicro.com), which then 
dials, connects, and sends the document to a fax machine.
 
✦ IP: Click this button to add a remote printer to your Mac through an 
Internet connection or a local network connection. Sending a job to an 
Internet Protocol (IP) printer actually shoots the document across a 
network or Internet connection by using a target IP address or domain 
name. Generally, it’s best to have a static (unchanging) IP address for a 
network printer; if the IP address changes often, for example, you have 
to reconfigure your connection to your IP printer each time it changes.

Adding a Funky Printer
 
✦ Windows: Click this button to add a shared printer that’s connected to 
a PC on your local network. “Hey, I get to use the enemy’s printers, too?” 
That’s right, as long as a Windows user on your network has shared his 
printer (via the ubiquitous Windows File and Printer Sharing feature). 
Sweet.
 
Oh, and there’s one additional important control on the toolbar that isn’t 
actually a button: You can click in the Search field and type text to locate a 
particular printer in any of these dialog lists. (Personally, I don’t have that 
many printers on my network, but in a larger company, this field can save 
you the trouble of scrolling through several pages of shared printers.)
Adding a Funky Printer
“And what,” you might ask, “is a funky printer?” Well, you have a number 
of possibilities, but they all add up to a non-USB connection. (Remember, I 
said that USB connections to a printer are generally automatic, or at least 
handled by the printer’s installation software.) Some of the non-USB 
connections I mention in the previous section include Windows shared 
printers and IP printers.
No matter which type of funky printer you add, it needs a driver installed 
in the Printers folder, which resides inside your MacBook’s Library folder. 
(A driver is a software program provided by the printer manufacturer that 
tells Mac OS X how to communicate with your printer.) Also, if the printer 
is PostScript compatible, it needs a Postscript Printer Description (PPD) 
file installed in your PPD folder, which also appears in the Printers folder. 
Luckily, Snow Leopard comes complete with a long list of drivers and PPD 
files already installed and available — bravo, Apple dudes and dudettes!
Speaking of third-party Mac OS X printer 
drivers, the most popular example of same 
is the Adobe Acrobat printer driver, which is 
installed by Adobe Acrobat and used to create 
electronic PDF documents. Although you 
certainly can install Adobe Acrobat under 
Snow Leopard, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention 
that you don’t have to! That’s because the 
operating system provides built-in support for 
printing documents in Adobe’s PDF format 
(which can then be viewed and printed on any 
other computer with Acrobat Reader or added 
to your Web site for downloading). Acrobat has 
more features, naturally, but — wait for it — 
don’t pay for Acrobat unless you need it!
In fact, you don’t even have to install a PDF 
print driver or display the Printer Browser! To 
print a document as a file in PDF format, click 
the PDF drop-down button in the application’s 
Print dialog, click Save as PDF from the menu, 
navigate to the desired folder and enter a 
filename, and then click Save.

658
Adding a Funky Printer
To add a funky printer, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the manufacturer’s installation application, which should copy 
the driver and PPD files for you.
 
 If you have to do things the hard way, manually copy the driver file into 
the Library/Printers folder and then copy the PPD file (if required) into 
the Library/Printers/PPD folder.
 
2. If you’re adding a physical printer — instead of an application printer 
driver — verify that the printer is turned on and accessible.
 
 If you’re printing to a shared printer connected to another Mac or PC, 
that computer has to be on. Luckily, most network printers (and their 
computer hosts) remain on all the time.
 
3. Display the Print & Fax pane within System Preferences and click the 
Add button (with the plus sign) on the Printing pane.
 
 You see the familiar Printer Browser. Shared printers using Bonjour 
network technology should show up on the default list, so you can click 
the printer to select it.
 
4. To add an IP printer, click the IP Printer button on the browser 
toolbar.
 
 Click the Protocol pop-up menu to choose the IP printing protocol 
(typically either IPP or the manufacturer-specific socket protocol). If you 
have a choice, it’s always a good idea to use the manufacturer-specific 
socket.
 
 Click in the Address box and type the printer’s IP address or Domain 
Name System (DNS) name, which should be provided by your network 
administrator or the person running the print server. You can use the 
default queue on the server by leaving the Queue box blank — which I 
recommend — or select the Queue text box and type a valid queue name 
for the server.
 
 If you don’t know a valid queue name, you’re up a creek — hence, my 
recommendation to use the default queue.
 
 If you like, you can type a name and location for the remote printer; 
this is purely for identification purposes. Finally, click the Print Using 
pop-up menu, choose the brand and model of the remote printer, and 
then click Add.
 
5. To add a Windows printer, click the Windows button on the Printer 
Browser toolbar.
 
 Click the correct Windows workgroup that includes the printer(s) that 
you want to use in the left column. After a scan of the specified workgroup, 

Book VIII

Managing Your Printing Jobs
Printer Browser displays the list of printers that it can access. (Don’t 
forget to thank His Billness later.)
 
6. After everything is tuned correctly, click the Print Using pop-up menu 
and choose the brand and model of the remote printer.
 
7. Click Add to complete the process and admire your new printer on 
the Print & Fax panel in System Preferences.
 
Heck, Snow Leopard even allows you to order supplies for many printers 
from the comfort of System Preferences! Sure, you’ll pay a premium price, 
but think of the techno-nerd bragging rights you’ll enjoy at your next Mac 
user group meeting! Click a printer in the Print & Fax pane and click the 
Options & Supplies button; then click the Supply Levels tab. When you click 
the Supplies button, System Preferences automatically launches Safari with 
the proper Web page from the Apple Store.
Managing Your Printing Jobs
You can also exercise some control over the documents — or, in technoid, 
print jobs — that you send to your printer. To display the jobs that are 
active (in line and preparing to print), open the Print & Fax pane in System 
Preferences and click the Open Print Queue button. (Alternatively, click the 
printer’s icon in the Dock to display the same window.)
The actions that you can perform from the Print Queue window (as shown in 
Figure 4-2) are

660
Managing Your Printing Jobs
 
✦ Delete: When you click a print job in the list and then click the Delete 
icon, the print job is removed from the queue. You might need to delete 
a print job if you discover a mistake in the document while printing.
 
 If the job is currently printing, several additional pages might be printed 
before the job is finally cancelled. In other words, information already 
sent to the printer might have to be printed before the cancel request 
can be processed.
 
✦ Hold: Click the Hold toolbar icon to pause printing of the current print 
job. The status of the print job changes to Hold.
 
✦ Resume: Click a print job in Hold status in the list and then click the 
Resume icon to resume printing.
Good question, and here’s the answer: Snow 
Leopard handles faxing so seamlessly that you 
don’t need a chapter’s worth of instruction! As 
long as your MacBook has an external analog 
(dial-up) fax modem connected to a phone line, 
you’re a lean faxing machine.
To fax any open document within an active 
application, just choose File➪Print or press 
Ô+P. Click the PDF button at the bottom of 
the Print dialog and click Fax PDF. Either type 
a telephone number directly in the To field, or 
click the suave-looking button with the profile 
next to the field and choose a contact with a 
telephone number from your Address Book. 
(Make sure that you type your fax number into 
the My Fax Number field, just to stay legal.) 
Next, type a dialing prefix if one is necessary 
to reach an outside line. If you’re going to use 
your laptop as a fax machine often, I definitely 
recommend selecting the Show Fax Status 
in Menu Bar check box. That way, you can 
monitor what’s happening as your Mac sends 
and receives throughout the day.
If you need a spiffy-looking cover page, 
select the Use Cover Page check box. Click 
in the Message box directly below it and type 
whatever you like. You can optionally type 
a subject as well. When all is ready, throw 
caution utterly to the wind and click the Fax 
button. The Printer Browser treats a fax just as 
it does any other printed document, so you can 
cancel it or monitor its progress, as I discuss 
in the section, “Managing Your Printing Jobs.”
Your MacBook can also receive faxes. To 
enable this feature, open System Preferences 
and click the Print & Fax icon. Click the entry 
for your fax in the list, click the Receive 
Options button, and then select the Receive 
Faxes on This Computer check box. Set the 
number of rings Snow Leopard should wait 
before answering the call. You can save your 
incoming faxes as files within a folder you 
specify or e-mail the contents automatically 
to any e-mail address you like. (Perfect for 
vacations!) If you like, you can even take the 
mundane route and print them on your system 
printer.

✦ Job Info: Click this button to display basic information about the 
selected print job, such as number of pages and page size.
 
✦ Pause Printer: Click this icon to stop all printing to this printer. Note, 
however, that unlike using the Delete command, Pause Printer doesn’t 
remove any print jobs from the list. When jobs are stopped, the Pause 
Printer icon morphs into Resume Printer — click it to restart all jobs in 
the queue list.
 
 This is a good feature to use when your printer is about to run out of 
paper.
 
✦ Supply Levels: If your printer supports remote supply monitoring, you 
can click this icon to display the current levels of ink and paper in your 
printer. (Thus saving your feet from the wear and tear of walking.)
 
✦ Printer Setup: Click this icon and Snow Leopard displays the model-
specific configuration settings and features (if any) that are available 
for the selected printer. Of course, these settings vary for every printer 
produced by the hand of Man — they’re actually determined by the 
manufacturer’s printer driver — but they usually include actions (such 
as cleaning and alignment) and settings (such as print quality).
Sharing a Printer across That There Network
Before we leave the Island of Big X Printing, I’d like to show you how to 
share a printer with others on your local network, using Snow Leopard’s 
super-easy Bonjour network sharing feature. (Earlier in this chapter, I show 
you how to connect to other shared printers around you. Here, you’re going 
to share a printer that’s connected directly to your MacBook, like a portable 
photo printer.)
 
If you decide to share your printers, don’t be surprised if Mac OS X seems 
to slow down slightly from time to time. This is because of the processing 
time necessary for your MacBook to store queued documents from other 
computers. The hard drive activity on your laptop is likely to significantly 
increase as well.
Once again, turn to System Preferences! Click the Sharing icon; then click 
the Printer Sharing check box to select it. (When it comes to printing, Snow 
Leopard gives you more than one way to skin a . . . well, you get the idea, 
even without the bad pun.) To share a printer, click the check box next to 
the desired printer (as shown in Figure 4-3) and click the Add button to 
select which users will have access to the shared printer. (By default, a 
shared printer can be accessed by everyone.) Voilà! You’re the guru!

Sharing a Printer across That There Network

“Hey, what about my firewall?” Perhaps you would worry if you were using 
that Other Operating System — which shall remain nameless here — but 
you’re using Snow Leopard, and everything is set automatically for you the 
moment you click the Printer Sharing check box! Snow Leopard automatically 
opens the correct port in your firewall to allow printer sharing. (And yes, if 
you decide not to share your printers and you deselect the Printer Sharing 
check box later, Snow Leopard cleans up after you. It closes the port in your 
firewall for you.) Super-flippin’ sweet.
The printers that you specify are available to other computers within the 
same IP subnet. In other words, someone in your local network can use your 
printers, but no one outside your network has access.
 
If you haven’t already assigned a printer a descriptive name, click the 
desired printer from the list in the Print & Fax pane and then click the 
Options & Supplies button. Click the General button on the sheet that 
appears and enter a descriptive name in the Name text field. You can also 
identify that printer’s location in the Location text field. For example, in an 
office environment, I like to add the room number to a shared printer name 
(as well as the Location field).

n Chapter 1 of this minibook, I present you with an overview of the most 
popular hardware that you can add to your MacBook — and where 
there’s hardware, software can’t be far behind. (Somebody famous said 
that — I think it was either Bill Gates or Dennis Miller. I consider both of 
them famous comedians.)
Anyway, Mac OS X comes with a full suite of software tools right out of the 
box. You get Internet connectivity, disk repair, a digital audio and video 
player, basic image editing and cataloging, digital video editing, and — 
depending on the price that you paid or the MacBook model that you 
bought — even games and a complete set of productivity applications. 
However, if you’re willing to pay for additional features and a manual (at 
least what passes for a manual in the manufacturer’s opinion), you can 
make all these tasks easier and accomplish them in even shorter time.
Read on for an overview of the most popular third-party software applications 
for Mac OS X: what everyone’s using, how much they cost, and why they’re 
(usually) better. Before you drop a wad of cash on a fancy new application, 
though, remember yet another of Mark’s Maxims:
 
If a program you already have does everything you really need — and 
you like the way it works — you don’t have to upgrade. Honest and truly.

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
Yes, I know I’ve been poking fun at His Gatesness for much of this book — you 
have to admit, he makes a pretty good target — but he did pull PC owners out 
of the character-based world of DOS, and I’ll be the first to say that he does 
get things right quite often. (Witness my bestselling book PCs All-in-One Desk 
Reference For Dummies [Wiley], recently revised for a fourth edition!)
For example, I’ve always been more impressed with Microsoft Office than 
I’ve been with Microsoft Windows. (At least Windows XP Professional and 
Windows Vista are steps in the right direction, but they still have a long way 
to go to match Mac OS X.) Office has long been the productivity suite of 
choice in the Windows world, and it’s also been a popular favorite in years 
past on the Macintosh side.
A lot of hard work was put into the latest version of Microsoft Office, and it 
shows. Office 2008 was designed specifically for Mac OS X, using the rules 
that Apple recommends for the Aqua user interface. As you can see in 
Figure 5-1, it looks much like a native Mac OS X application (such as Pages 
from iWork, which is Apple’s competing office productivity suite).
 
Figure 5-1: 
Man, that is 
one good-
looking 
Office. 
Thanks, 
Microsoft 
(and I mean 
that).
 
However, as with Mac OS X itself, Office 2008 isn’t just an attractive exterior. 
Consider some of the advantages of Office 2008:

Applications That 
You’ve (Probably)

The Trundling Microsoft Mammoth
 
✦ Perfect document compatibility with the Windows version of Office: 
You can both read and write documents with transparent ease, no 
matter which platform gets the file. Documents can be shared among 
platforms on the same network.
 
✦ Mirrored commands: Office 2007 and Mac Office 2008 have similar menu 
items, dialogs, and settings, thus making Mac OS X instantly familiar to 
anyone who’s used Office on a Windows PC.
 
✦ Support for native Aqua features: This includes transparent graphics 
within your documents, input and confirmation sheets, and palettes for 
formatting.
 
✦ Tons of templates, samples, and support files: Microsoft doesn’t scrimp 
on ready-to-use documents and templates, as well as additional fonts, 
clip art, and Web samples.
 
✦ Entourage: Entourage is the Macintosh counterpart to Windows Outlook. 
It combines most of the same features that you’ll find in the Apple Mail, 
iCal, and Address Book applications. (Read about Apple Mail in Book 
VI, Chapter 2; read about the Address Book in Book II, Chapter 6.) Use 
Entourage to participate in Internet newsgroups; it also includes a 
Mailing List Manager to help you keep track of the deluge of list messages 
that you receive every day.
Besides Entourage, Office 2008 on the Mac includes four other applications:
 
✦ Word: The word processing application that rules the planet
 
✦ Excel: The leading spreadsheet application
If you’re already using iWork ’09, you might 
have noticed that the Office applications Excel, 
Word, and PowerPoint provide roughly the 
same features. Therefore, you might wonder 
whether you should scrap iWork.
Remember my maxim — if the iWork suite 
that you’re familiar with is doing the job, I 
recommend that you keep it. After all, iWork is a 
powerful productivity suite on its own, capable 
of producing results that are easily as good as 
or better than Office 2008. Also, Apple provides 
conversion filters that allow you to open and 
save Office documents so that you’re not 
isolated from the Office crowd.
On the other side of the coin, I do recommend 
that you buy Office if
 ✓ You prefer the Office 2008 menu design and 
features.
 ✓ You’d like to keep most of the same 
commands replicated in the same places 
as the Windows version of Office.
 ✓ You want to seamlessly share documents 
with co-workers who use Windows Office 
on your network or through e-mail.
What about iWork?

Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro
 
✦ Messenger: Microsoft’s answer to iChat, an instant messaging program 
compatible with the Windows version of Messenger
 
✦ PowerPoint: A favorite presentation development application
The Mac Office 2008 Home and Student suite costs about $125 at the time 
of this writing. You might save a few dollars if you buy it online from a Web 
store such as MacMall (www.macmall.com).
Your Mac OS X Toolbox: TechTool Pro
My favorite native Mac OS X disk repair application is TechTool Pro from 
Micromat (www.micromat.com).
 
More than just about any other type of application, it’s important for a disk 
maintenance program to be built “from the ground up” for Mac OS X. Never 
attempt to repair a Mac OS X disk using an older repair utility not designed 
for Snow Leopard.
With TechTool Pro 5 (as shown in Figure 5-2), you can thoroughly check 
a hard drive for both physical errors (such as faulty electronics or a bad 
sector on the disk surface) and logical errors (incorrect folder data and 
glitches in the file structure). The Disk Utility that’s included with Mac OS X 
does a fine job of checking the latter, but it doesn’t perform the physical 
testing — and TechTool Pro does both.
 
I should note, however, that TechTool Pro doesn’t take care of viruses. Pick 
up a copy of VirusBarrier X5 (www.intego.com) to protect yourself against 
viral attack.
TechTool Pro also takes care of disk optimization, which is a feature that’s 
been conspicuously absent from Mac OS X since the beginning. As I explain 
in Book II, Chapter 7, defragmenting your disk will result in better perfor-
mance and a faster system overall.
TechTool Pro 5, which will set you back about $80, comes on a self-booting 
DVD-ROM, so you can easily fix your startup volume by booting your system 
from the installation disc.

Image Editing for the Masses
The only one true King of the Retouching Hill in Mac OS X, Adobe Photoshop 
(www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) has been the digital-image 
editing favorite of Mac owners for many years now. As does Office 2008, the 
latest version of Photoshop (CS4) also takes full advantage of the Aqua 
standard.
You can find more three-pound Photoshop books on the shelf than politicians 
in trouble, so it’s no surprise that I can’t provide you with a sweeping list 
of its features in this section. However, here’s a summary of what you can 
expect from Adobe’s crown jewel:
 
✦ Superior editing: The most sophisticated image editing possible for a 
digital photograph. If you can accomplish an image-editing task in 
software, it’s very likely that Photoshop can do it. You can even combine 
and splice parts of different images to produce a new work of art or 
perhaps distort and liquefy an image to produce a new look.

668
The Morass of Digital Video
 
✦ Image retouching tools: These help you rescue images with problems, 
such as overexposure and color imbalance. (You can also use tools such 
as the Healing brush to erase imperfections in the photograph’s subject.)
 
✦ Plug-ins: Photoshop has been a standard for plug-in functionality since 
it first appeared. If you need features that aren’t in the application out of 
the box, you can add them through third-party plug-ins.
 
✦ Web posting: Prepare images for use on the Web.
 
✦ Painting tools: Use these gems to simulate different types of inks, 
paints, and brushes on different types of media.
 
Although Photoshop is a hefty $699 for the full package, Adobe has also 
created a kid brother, Photoshop Elements, which sells for a mere $90. 
Designed for the novice or intermediate-level photographer, Elements 
has most of the functionality of the full package that you’re likely to 
need. Elements also provides a number of very helpful assistants to help 
automate the most common image-editing tasks, as well as one of the most 
comprehensive Help systems I’ve ever used.
The Morass of Digital Video
Two types of applications make up the DV market: digital video editing (in 
which you create a movie) and DVD mastering (in which you take that movie 
and create a DVD movie). You can find a number of great applications on 
the market in both these categories, all at different price points and different 
levels of complexity. They include
 
✦ iMovie: I cover this easy-to-use video editing iApp in Book IV, Chapter 4. 
A good choice for any novice, it’s usually bundled for free with today’s 
new Mac models, and you get it as part of the iLife suite.
 
✦ iDVD: This is the DVD mastering counterpart to iMovie. Although it’s a 
snap to use, it doesn’t offer a lot of advanced features. (Book IV, 
Chapter 5 explains iDVD in detail.) Again, you receive it free with your Mac.
 
✦ DVD Studio Pro: Apple’s entry into the ranks of DVD mastering can 
produce a commercial-quality DVD movie disc, but don’t expect any 
hand holding or assistants with this application. This is a serious tool 
for professionals, and as part of Apple’s Final Cut Studio 2, it’ll set you 
back $1,300. With DVD Studio Pro 4 (www.apple.com/finalcut
studio/dvdstudiopro), you can add interactive, animated menus, 
subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and Web interactivity to your DVD 
projects.

Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
 
✦ Final Cut Pro 6: As another part of that uber $1,300 Final Cut Studio 2 
package, you’d assume Final Cut Pro (www.apple.com/finalcut
studio/finalcutpro) to be the best DV editing package on the 
market for Mac OS X . . . and you wouldn’t get any argument from me. 
It offers real-time playback with RT Extreme HD — no waiting for 
rendering — and high-definition support over a FireWire connection. 
Sassy.
Yes, It’s Really Called “Toast”
Time to turn your attention to a subject near and dear to my heart: recording 
data CDs, audio CDs, and DVDs on the Macintosh. Of course, Mac OS X 
can burn basic data CDs that you can share with your Windows and UNIX 
friends without any add-on software. If you have a MacBook equipped with 
a SuperDrive or an external DVD recorder, you can create standard, cross-
platform data DVDs, too. But what if you need an exotic format, such as CD 
Extra, that allows data and digital audio tracks to co-exist peacefully on one 
disc? Or perhaps you need a self-booting disc, or you just got a Blu-ray 
external recorder?
There’s one clear choice: When you’re ready to seriously burn, you’re ready 
for Roxio Toast Titanium (www.roxio.com), the CD and DVD recording 
choice for millions of Mac owners. (No snickering about the name, please.) 
Figure 5-3 illustrates this powerhouse of an application, which is an elegant 
design that’s both simple to use and perfectly Aqua. Files, folders, and digital 
audio tracks that you want to record are simply dropped into the application 
window.
As for exotic formats, here’s a list of what types of discs you can record with 
Toast:
 
✦ Standard data CDs and DVDs
 
✦ Standard audio CDs
 
✦ Video CDs
 
✦ MP3 discs (which store MP3 audio tracks)
 
✦ Discs recorded from an image file
 
✦ Mac volumes
 
✦ Hybrid PC/Mac discs
 
✦ ISO 9660 discs

670
If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
 
✦ Multisession discs
 
✦ CD Extra discs
Toast works with both internal and external CD, DVD, and Blu-ray recorders, 
taking advantage of the latest features on today’s drives. You can also copy 
existing discs, using one or multiple drives.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Toast is the 
classic Mac 
CD and DVD 
recording 
application.
 
Toast is quite affordable at $80. You can buy it directly from the Roxio online 
store at www.roxio.com.
If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
Here’s where Mac power users usually start grinning from ear to ear like 
Santa’s elves on the day after Christmas, because — get this — many of 
the great Unwashed Windows Horde still actually think that you can’t run 
Windows on a Macintosh! Can you believe that? Obviously, they haven’t 
heard of Boot Camp, which is built into Snow Leopard . . . but what if you 
don’t want to reboot to switch operating systems? What if you need to share 
data between both Mac and PC applications running simultaneously? Well, 
that’s where Parallels Desktop from Parallels (www.parallels.com) comes 
in, which without a doubt is one of the coolest applications ever written for 
the Mac.

If You Positively Have to Run Windows . . .
No, my friend, your eyes aren’t deceiving you — you’re indeed looking at 
Windows 2000 running on my MacBook in Figure 5-4. Parallels Desktop 
(which requires Mac OS X) provides a near-perfect PC environment for any 
version of Windows from 95 all the way up to Vista; literally, Windows has no 
idea that it’s not running on a typical piece of PC iron.
 
Figure 5-4: 
Take that, 
Bill! I get 
to play in 
your pool, 
without 
rebooting!
 
Parallels Desktop simulates everything necessary for you to get the full 
functionality out of Windows. For example, this jewel automatically (and 
transparently) handles your Windows Internet connection, network tasks, 
and CD and DVD access. You can run full-screen or run Windows in a 
window. (Pun joyfully intended.)
As if that weren’t enough, you can also run multiple operating systems. 
So if you need Linux or Windows 2000 along with your Vista system, no 
problem — all it takes is the install disc for those operating systems and the 
hard drive space to hold ’em. Outstanding!
Naturally, performance is an issue — and, to be honest, Parallels Desktop 
isn’t for the PC gamer, even with the newest MacBooks and their super-
duper GeForce video cards. Because today’s PC games push an actual PC to 
the limit, they just run too sluggishly on a MacBook emulating a PC — they 

672
All Hail FileMaker Pro
do run, just slowly. (Also, virtually all of today’s blockbuster PC games are 
also being ported to Mac OS X, so why not just run the Mac version?)
However, when it comes to just about any other type of application, Parallels 
Desktop running on a late-model Intel-based Mac can deliver performance 
equal to a typical Pentium 4 PC. The more memory that your MacBook has, 
the more you can give your virtual PC, so it also pays to have 2GB or more 
of RAM. I use this application with niche Windows programs that have never 
appeared on the Mac. (Again, you don’t need to use Desktop to run the 
Windows version of Photoshop CS4 because Photoshop CS4 is also available 
for the Mac.)
If you’re tired of the undeserved taunts from your clueless Windows 
friends — you know, the ones who say that you can’t run both Mac and 
Windows programs at the same time — head to your browser and order a 
copy of Parallels Desktop. The program is a very affordable $80 — but don’t 
forget: You have to supply your own copy of Windows. For a free taste of 
virtual computing, try VirtualBox at www.virtualbox.org.
All Hail FileMaker Pro
If databases are the name of your game, you’ve already been using FileMaker 
Pro for years (on both Mac and Windows, more than likely). For the uninitiated, 
FileMaker Pro (www.filemakerpro.com) is the premier database creation, 
editing, and maintenance application for Mac OS X. It comes with dozens of 
ready-made database templates for business, home, and education use, or 
you can construct your own database in surprisingly short order.
Right out of the box, FileMaker Pro can create
 
✦ Business databases and forms for inventory, personnel, purchase 
orders, and product catalogs
 
✦ Home databases for budgeting, recipes, music CDs, DVD movies, family 
medical records, and event planning
 
✦ Education databases for student records, expense reports, field trip 
planning, book and multimedia libraries, and class scheduling
FileMaker Pro 10 can add images and multimedia to your database, and you 
can quickly and easily publish your databases on your Web site by using one 
of the built-in theme designs. (In fact, visitors to your Web site can update 
your database online, if you like.) FileMaker Pro can also allow multiple 
users to share data across your network, no matter whether they’re running 
the Mac or Windows version. The latest version even runs scripts automatically 
based on user input.
At $299, FileMaker Pro 10 is one of the least expensive — and most 
powerful — applications that you can buy for the Big X.

The next stop on this Cavalcade of Software is an assortment of the absolute 
best you’ve-got-to-get-this utility applications. Sooner or later, you’re likely 
going to buy (or register) these utilities because you’ll use them every day.
StuffIt
In the Windows world, the Zip archive is the king of archiving formats. An 
archive contains one or more compressed files that you can uncompress 
whenever you need them. Folks store files in archives to save space on their 
hard drives; archiving is also a neat way to package an entire folder’s worth 
of files in a single convenient file, which you can attach to an e-mail message 
or send via File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Mac OS X includes built-in support 
for zip files.
On Planet Macintosh, many folks prefer the StuffIt archiving format. 
Manage your archives with StuffIt Deluxe 2009, from Smith Micro Software 
(mysmithmicro.com). StuffIt Deluxe 2009 can both archive and unarchive 
.sit files (the common name for StuffIt archives) as well as Zip archives 
from your Windows friends. You can also encrypt the contents of a StuffIt 
archive for those “sensitive” transfers. The application runs $80 at the Smith 
Micro Software online Web store.
QuicKeys X3
QuicKeys X3, from Startly Technologies (www.startly.com), is another 
example of someone’s thinking properly. This time, the idea is to automate 
repetitive tasks by allowing Mac OS X to memorize what you do. Think 
of QuicKeys X3 as a system-wide, macro playback application. Unlike 
AppleScript, however, QuicKeys X3 works within any application and 
can play back mouse movement and clicks/double-clicks. (And unlike 
Automator, you can perform any action that you could normally perform 
within an application by typing.)
I’ve used QuicKeys X3 for a number of different tasks, including
 
✦ Typing a commonly used block of text (such as my address) into 
applications that don’t support macros
 
✦ Launching applications at specific times and dates
 
✦ Operating menus within programs to automate complex tasks
 
✦ Launching Classic or choosing a specific startup disk with a single key 
sequence
QuicKeys X3 sells for $80 on the Startly Technologies Web site.

Utilities That Rock
BBEdit
Although we all know and love Mac OS X as a graphical operating system, 
folks still need a powerful text editor, such as the one shown in Figure 5-5, 
for creating and modifying text files. For example, software developers and 
Webmasters still use text editors daily to write applications or apply a quick 
fix to the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) that makes up a Web page. (I 
use a text editor to make minor changes to my Web site, MLC Books Online, 
without firing up a horrendous Web design application. Talk about overkill!)
 
Figure 5-5: 
For editing 
text, you’ll 
find no

than BBEdit.
 
Bare Bones Software pulls no punches in describing BBEdit — its advertising 
still proclaims, “It doesn’t suck.” Gotta give Bare Bones credit; this incredibly 
popular editor includes features such as
 
✦ Support for DOS/Windows, Mac, and UNIX text files: Yes, differences 
do exist between the platforms, even with a so-called pure text file.
 
✦ Works with text files over 2GB in size: Try that with TextEdit. Hmm . . . 
on second thought, please don’t.
 
✦ HTML tools for Web design: These tools include syntax checking and 
browser preview.
 
✦ grep pattern-based, multifile search and replace: In nonprogrammer/
non-UNIX English, that means a very sophisticated search-and-replace 
function that can span more than one text file.

✦ Syntax coloring: Use this to help you quickly locate commands and

✦ Built-in FTP transfer commands: No need to launch a separate FTP 
application: You can send your files right from within BBEdit.
You can even expand the functionality of BBEdit with plug-ins, many of 
which are free extensions written by programmers and developers specifically 
for languages such as C/C++, Java/JavaScript, Perl, and Pascal.
BBEdit 9 is available from the Bare Bones Software site for $125.
REALbasic
The final application that I want to mention really isn’t a utility as such; 
however, you can use it to write your own software, so I guess that it should 
qualify. As an ex-COBOL programmer, reluctant Visual Basic shareware 
developer, and recalcitrant dBASE coder, I can tell you that REALbasic (from 
REAL Software) is definitely the easiest visual drag-and-drop programming 
environment that I’ve ever used on a personal computer. If you want to 
develop your own productivity applications, Mac OS X utilities, or — dare I 
say it? your own game! — award-winning REALbasic 2009 is the way to go.
Development in REALbasic is as simple as designing the application window 
by first simply adding controls, text, and multimedia wherever you like. 
Then just fill in the blanks, such as by setting variables and specifying what 
happens when the controls are triggered, which you do by using a new 
implementation of the tried-and-true BASIC language. Of course, some 
programming knowledge is required, but far less than you’d need with Visual 
Basic. And the results look as good as anything you can accomplish in those 
so-called real programming languages.
Check out these features:
 
✦ Cross-platform support so that you can write your program once and 
compile it for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Code it once; then 
release three versions with no extra work. This is a very Superb Thing.
 
✦ Support for all sorts of multimedia, including QuickTime.
 
✦ Ability to animate and rotate text and objects, or tap the 3-D power of 
QuickDraw3D and OpenGL graphics.
 
✦ Capability to allow printing, network, and Internet communications 
within your application.
 
✦ Automation of Microsoft Office applications and connection of your 
REALbasic application to business databases (such as FileMaker Pro).
 
✦ Completely royalty-free applications, so you can give them away or 
release them as shareware.

676
At Least One Game
REALbasic has been such a popular development tool on the Macintosh 
for so many years that dozens of user-supported Web sites and mailing 
lists have sprung up, offering all sorts of REALbasic plug-ins, tutorials, and 
sample code for you to use in your own projects.
REALbasic 2009 comes in two versions: the Personal Edition ($99) and the 
Professional Edition ($500). You can order either version from the REAL 
Software site at www.realsoftware.com.
At Least One Game
To be completely accurate, Mac OS X already comes with at least one 
game — a very good version of chess, which I cover in the next section — 
but the Macintosh has never been considered a true gaming platform by 
most computer owners. Until recently, many popular Windows games were 
never ported (or converted) for the Mac, and only the most expensive Mac 
models had the one important component that determines the quality of 
today’s games: a first-rate, 3-D video card.
However, within the last two years or so, all that has changed dramatically. All 
of today’s MacBook models feature muscle-car-quality video cards that use 
the NVIDIA GeForce chipsets; they can handle the most complex 3-D graphics 
with ease. Match that with the renewed popularity of the Macintosh as a 
home computer and the performance of the current crop of Intel-based 
processors, and — wham! Suddenly you’ve got the best game developers 
in the business — id Software (www.idsoftware.com) and Blizzard 
(www.blizzard.com), to name two — releasing Macintosh versions of their 
newest games concurrently with the Windows version.
For the gamer in you, allow me to take you on a tour of the best of the new 
generation of entertainment.
Mac OS X Chess
No mercenaries, no rail guns, and no cities to raze — but chess is still the 
world’s most popular game, and Mac OS X even includes a little 3-D as well. 
Figure 5-6 illustrates the Chess application at play; you’ll find it in your 
Applications folder.
The game features speech recognition, move hints, take back (or undo) for 
your last move, and a 2-D or 3-D board. You can also list your games in text 
form and print them or save games in progress. Maybe it’s not a complete 
set of bells and whistles as commercial chess games offer, but the price is 
right, and the play can be quite challenging when you set it at the higher 
skill levels.

World of Warcraft
I end this chapter with Blizzard’s best: the online megahit that is World of 
Warcraft. This MMORPG (short for massive multiplayer online role-playing 
game) is yet another wrinkle in the popular Warcraft game series. World of 
Warcraft puts the character you create in the boots of human princes, Orc 
battle generals, undead champions, trolls, gnomes, and elfin lords — in 
fact, you can create multiple characters and play them as you choose. My 
recommendation: Stick with the Undead, my friend.
Combat, however, is only half the job. By finishing quests and killing various 
nasties, you earn experience, upgrade your armor and weapons, and build 
reputation with various groups throughout the land. You can take to the air, 
buy goods from mercenaries, and even discover a trade like leatherworking 
or enchanting. Spells abound, and you can join a guild and chat with the new 
friends you make online . . . I’ve played for over two years now, and I’m still 
excited by this incredible game.
Control is by both keyboard and mouse; the game is easy to understand, 
but you’ll always find someone to kick your posterior in battlegrounds or 
dungeons over the Internet.

T
ime to talk cordless. Your MacBook is already pretty doggone all-
inclusive because what most computers string together with cords has 
been integrated into the laptop’s case, including the monitor and speakers. 
Depending on the connection options that you choose when you buy your 
laptop (or what you added since), the only cord that you absolutely need 
might be your AC power cord.
For most of us, this introduces an entirely new realm of possibilities . . . 
and that results in more questions. Exactly how do other wireless devices 
communicate with your MacBook? Can you really share the data on your 
laptop with your cell phone? Can you sit in the comfort of your overstuffed 
recliner and watch a DVD from 15 feet away?
In this chapter, I describe to you what’s cooking in the world of wireless 
devices. I don’t delve into wireless Ethernet networking between your 
MacBook and other computers; that’s covered in depth in the confines 
of Book VII, Chapter 3. I also don’t discuss the Apple Remote in this chapter; 
that’s covered in Book II, Chapter 5. However, I do cover the wireless 
Bluetooth connections that you can make with devices other than computers.
Bluetooth: What a Silly Name 
for Such Cool Technology
Originally, wireless computer connections were limited to IR (infrared) and 
802.11b (the original Wi-Fi specification for wireless Ethernet networks). 
This was fine; after all, what were you gonna connect to your Mac besides 
other computers? Ah, but progress marches on.

680
Bluetooth: What a Silly Name for Such Cool Technology
A little Danish history
Enter the explosion in popularity of modern cell phones and personal 
digital assistants (PDAs). In 1998, a consortium of big-name cell phone, PDA, 
and computer laptop manufacturers decided that their products needed 
a method of communicating with each other. This new wireless standard 
needed to be inexpensive and consume as little battery power as possible, 
so designers decided to keep the operational distance limited to a maximum 
of about 30 feet. Plus, the idea was to keep this new wireless system as 
hassle free as possible: Everyone agreed that when you’re using one device, 
you should simply be able to walk within range of another device for the two 
to link up immediately and automatically. Thus, Bluetooth was born!
Bluetooth has been incorporated into a range of peripherals and devices, 
including
 
✦ Cell phones
 
✦ Laptops
 
✦ Wireless computer peripherals, such as keyboards and mice
 
✦ Printers
 
✦ Headphones
 
If the name Bluetooth sounds faintly like Viking-speak to you, it should. 
For some absolutely ridiculous reason, the companies that developed the 
Bluetooth standard decided to name their creation after the tenth-century 
Danish king Harald Blatand, nicknamed Bluetooth, who succeeded in joining 
Denmark and Norway in a political alliance. Hence the rather Viking and 
runic-looking Bluetooth symbol. (Geez, these folks need to take a day off. 
Read comic books or play with a Slinky. Something.)
Is your MacBook Bluetooth-ready?
Danish royalty aside, you still need to know whether your MacBook is ready 
for a Bluetooth connection. At the time of this writing, all Apple laptops 
come with internal Bluetooth hardware. If you’re using an older Mac laptop 
without Bluetooth built in, though, you’re currently out of the Bluetooth loop.
However, you don’t need to pitch your faithful laptop if it doesn’t yet talk 
to the pirate (or if your internal Bluetooth hardware fails)! You can add 
Bluetooth capability to your computer with a simple USB Bluetooth adapter. 
The USB Bluetooth adapter from Belkin (www.belkin.com) sells online for 
about $30. It includes automatic data encryption, which is necessary only if 
there’s a hacker within about 30 to 60 feet of your computer (although in my 
book, more security is always better). The adaptor can link with up to seven 
other Bluetooth devices simultaneously. (Come to think of it, there were a 
lot of people within 30 feet of my MacBook Pro during my last LAN party 
bash. I guess this stuff really is important!)

Bluetooth: What a Silly Name for Such Cool Technology
Snow Leopard and Bluetooth, together forever
You’d expect a modern, high-tech operating system like Mac OS X to come 
with Bluetooth drivers. You’d be right, but Apple goes a step further: Snow 
Leopard comes with a Bluetooth pane in System Preferences and a utility 
application to help you get your laptop connected with the Bluetooth 
devices that are likely hanging out in your coat pockets.
Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock. From the Bluetooth pane, 
you can
 
✦ Set up new Bluetooth devices. Click the Set Up New Device button to 
run the Bluetooth Setup Assistant, which configures Bluetooth devices 
for use with Snow Leopard.
 
 Follow the device-specific, on-screen instructions to set up a number 
of common Bluetooth toys (including keyboards, mice, cell phones, 
and printers), or you can work with other types of devices by choosing 
Other. Setup Assistant searches for your Bluetooth device and makes 
sure that it’s ready to party with your MacBook.
 
 Make sure that your Bluetooth device is in range and discoverable 
(available for connections with other Bluetooth devices) before you run 
the Bluetooth Setup Assistant. Check your user manual to determine 
how to set your Bluetooth device as discoverable, and make sure that 
you’re about 20 feet (or fewer) away from your MacBook.
 
✦ Configure Bluetooth connections. Click the Advanced button to create, 
remove, enable, or disable your Bluetooth connections, using them as 
virtual serial ports (for the simple transfer of data) or virtual modems 
(for bidirectional transfers, such as using an Internet connection 
through a Bluetooth cell phone).
 
 These openings to the outside world are presented as individual 
connections in the Serial Port list, and you can toggle them on and 
off individually. You can also specify whether a Bluetooth port is 
encrypted. Figure 6-1 shows an active Bluetooth virtual modem that’s 
set up to allow my MacBook Pro to sync up with my Palm Pilot, using 
the Bluetooth-PDA-Sync service.
 
I recommend that you enable the Show Bluetooth Status in the Menu Bar 
check box. The Bluetooth menu lets you conserve power by turning off your 
Bluetooth hardware until you need it. You can also conveniently toggle your 
laptop’s discovery status as well as set up a device or send and browse files. 
(You can even see what devices are connected to your MacBook with the 
click of a menu icon. ’Nuff said.)
 
If you know you won’t be using Bluetooth devices while you’re on the road, 
disabling a Bluetooth service on a laptop can help conserve battery power.

or disable

Advanced 
sheet.
 
The other Bluetooth resource that you can use is the stand-alone application 
Bluetooth File Exchange. (Yes, you can call it BFE if you like. I do whenever 
possible.) You have to launch BFE the old-fashioned way; it’s located in 
your Utilities folder, inside your Applications folder. As with a traditional 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) application, double-clicking the Bluetooth File 
Exchange icon presents you with a file selection dialog in which you choose 
the file(s) you want to send to the connected Bluetooth device! You can also 
elect to browse the files on a networked Bluetooth device so that you can 
see what the owner of that device is offering.
You can also set up your defaults for file exchanges from the Sharing pane 
in System Preferences. While you’re in the Bluetooth pane, click the File 
Sharing Setup button, and System Preferences whisks you directly to the 
Sharing pane. Select the Bluetooth Sharing check box to display the settings 
shown in Figure 6-2. Here, you can control what Snow Leopard does when 
you receive files or Personal Information Manager (PIM) data with BFE. For 
instance, with these settings, Snow Leopard can
 
✦ Prompt you for permission to receive each file or PIM item
 
✦ Accept all files and PIM items without restriction or prompting
 
✦ Save all incoming files and items to the folder that you specify
 
✦ Offer only the files and items in the folder that you specify when other 
Bluetooth items browse your MacBook
 
Personally, I’m all for the defaults in Snow Leopard for file exchanges:
 
✦ I Want to Know When Someone’s Sending Me Something
 
✦ I Want Anything I Receive to Be Saved in My Downloads Folder

Adding Wireless Keyboards and 
Mice to Your MacBook
The current crop of Mac laptops arrive at your doorstep in a fully wireless 
configuration: Apple throws in an internal Bluetooth adapter and an internal 
AirPort Extreme wireless card. Everything’s already included for you. 
Therefore, you can indeed work keyboard and mouse magic from across the 
room from your laptop, using a wireless keyboard and mouse that you can 
buy separately. (Or perhaps you just want a full-size keyboard and external 
mouse to use when you’re working from your home or office.)
A number of wireless Bluetooth keyboard/mouse packages are on the 
market, and any one of ’em should work fine with your MacBook. In fact, 
you can buy Apple’s wireless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse separately, 
for a total of about $150. Other offerings from Logitech and our old buddy 
Microsoft run about the same amount.
When shopping for a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse desktop, keep these facts 
in mind:
 
✦ Some keyboards are created more than equal. Many of today’s third-
party keyboards are encrusted with extra function buttons that do 
everything from opening your e-mail application to searching your 
kitchen cabinets for another can of spray cheese.

684
Getting Everything in iSync
 
 I like these programmable function keys — they can bring up your 
favorite applications with a single keystroke while you’re relaxing 20 feet 
away — so I recommend that you look for the keyboard that offers the 
most programmable keys in your price range.
 
✦ Rodents crave energy. Does the wireless mouse come with its own 
recharging stand? If so, that’s a big plus. Depending on how much you 
use your laptop, a mouse that runs on standard batteries can go through 
a set in as little as a month’s time! (Not surprisingly, many computer 
owners use rechargeable batteries in their wireless mice.) In fact, some 
wireless mice include an on/off switch to help conserve battery power.
 
✦ Wireless doesn’t always mean Bluetooth. Just because a keyboard or 
mouse is wireless doesn’t automatically make it a Bluetooth device. 
Plenty of wireless RF (radio frequency) devices are out there, too. 
These toys need their own transmitters, which are usually USB-based as 
well, so things can get confusing. Therefore, read the box or technical 
specifications carefully to make sure you’re buying Bluetooth.
 
✦ Bluetooth stuff isn’t self-cleaning. Sure, your new wireless keyboard 
and mouse can hang out with you on the sofa, but that doesn’t mean 
they’re happy sharing your nacho puffs and grape soda. Look for an 
optical mouse that doesn’t use a ball, and check whether a prospective 
keyboard can be easily cleaned and maintained before you buy it.
Most Bluetooth devices are installed and controlled through the Bluetooth 
pane in System Preferences. However, wireless keyboards and mice are a 
special case because they’re installed via the Bluetooth controls in both the 
Keyboard and Mouse panes. (Geez, those Apple designers give you a dozen 
roads to the same spot on the map, don’t they?)
Getting Everything in iSync
No jokes about boy bands, please. iSync is the data transfer and 
synchronizing utility application that ships with Snow Leopard, and it 
works fine with both wired and wireless Bluetooth connections. The difference 
between Bluetooth File Exchange and iSync is a matter of intelligence:
 
✦ BFE merely transfers files and dumps them in the folders you specify.
 
✦ iSync copies and updates your Address Book, Safari, and iCal information 
between devices. iSync compares the information on both your laptop 
and your devices and makes sure they end up the same.
 
 iSync also allows you to synchronize data between multiple computers 
using your MobileMe membership so that the contacts, bookmarks, 
and calendar data on your MacBook match the data on your Mac Pro. 
You can control what gets sent from the MobileMe pane in System 
Preferences.

The Magic of Wireless Printing
 
Just because your phone or PDA supports Bluetooth doesn’t mean that iSync 
is guaranteed to work. I know a few Mac owners who are still seething over 
incompatible devices. For a complete list of the Bluetooth phones, PDAs, 
and other devices that work with iSync, visit www.apple.com/isync/
devices.html.
After your supported Bluetooth device is linked to your MacBook, follow 
these steps to add the new device to iSync and synchronize your data:
 
1. Click the Finder icon on the Dock.
 
2. Click Applications in the Finder window Sidebar and double-click 
iSync.
 
3. Press Ô+N.
 
 iSync displays the Add Device dialog.
 
4. Click Scan to display any Bluetooth devices in range.
 
5. Double-click the device that you want to use.
 
 The window expands to allow you to specify what data is to be 
synchronized. (Other settings might appear as well, depending on the 
device.)
 
6. Select the check boxes for each data type that you want to exchange.
 
7. Click Sync Devices.
 
Never disconnect a device while a synchronization is in progress. You risk 
corrupting the data being transferred and locking up your MacBook. Wait 
until iSync indicates that the synchronization is finished; the application 
displays a message when the process is complete.
 
Deleting a calendar event or a contact on either your laptop or the Bluetooth 
device deletes that same data from the other machine! For example, if you 
decide that you no longer need your personal contacts on your Mac at work 
and you delete ’em, they’ll be deleted from your PDA when you synchronize. 
When I say that iSync creates a mirror image on both sides of the connection, 
I’m not lying: Additions appear and deletions disappear.
The Magic of Wireless Printing
To your Mac laptop, a wireless Bluetooth printer is just another Bluetooth 
connection — but to you, it’s the very definition of convenience, especially if 
desk space is limited next to your Mac. Just set that paper-producing puppy 
up anywhere in the 30 40 foot range, plug it in, set up the printer in Snow 
Leopard, and let ’er rip.

686
The Magic of Wireless Printing
 
Not all printer manufacturers produce Bluetooth models that communicate 
properly with your MacBook. Make sure that the Bluetooth printer you buy 
supports HCRP. (Another jawbreaker acronym. This time it stands for 
Hardcopy Cable Replacement Protocol.)
You have two options when installing a Bluetooth printer:
 
✦ Whenever possible, use the printer manufacturer’s software. A printer 
might require a driver that a typical Bluetooth device doesn’t need.
 
✦ You can usually successfully set up a printer via the Bluetooth Setup 
Assistant, which you can run from the Bluetooth pane of System 
Preferences (as I discuss earlier in the chapter):
 
a. Make sure your printer is set as discoverable.
 
 Check your printer manual to determine how to switch your printer 
to discoverable mode. This mode allows other Bluetooth devices 
within range (including your laptop) to recognize and make a 
connection to your printer.
 
b. Click the Set Up New Device button.
 
c. Choose to install a printer.
 
d. Follow the onscreen instructions.
Luckily, after you successfully set up a Bluetooth printer, you can just press 
Ô+P to open the Print dialog box and choose that printer from the Printer 
pop-up menu. No big whoop . . . and that’s the way it should be.

Chapter 1: Using UNIX 
on Your MacBook
In This Chapter
✓ Why use UNIX?
✓ Doing things with the keyboard
✓ Introducing UNIX commands
✓ Creating text files
✓ Exploring deep inside Mac OS X
A
s I mention in the first chapter of the Book II, UNIX lurks deep beneath 
the shiny Aqua exterior of Mac OS X. UNIX is a tried-and-true operating 
system that’s been around for decades, since the days when mainframe 
computers were king. If you don’t believe that it’s a powerful (and popular) 
operating system, consider that more than half of all Web servers on the 
Internet use some variety of UNIX as their operating system of choice.
Besides being battle-tested and having a long history, UNIX offers some 
fantastic features. Unlike the graphical world of Mac OS X, the keyboard 
plays an integral role while you’re using a UNIX-based operating system. 
Because UNIX is text based, you’ll find that it has evolved with a large set 
of useful keyboard-driven commands that can perform powerful feats not 
easily equaled by a mouse user. This chapter examines the role of the 
keyboard in UNIX operating systems and describes how to execute standard 
file system commands. You also discover how to use Apple’s additional set 
of commands and install your own commands (and simple programs) from 
the Internet.
Why Use the Keyboard?
To begin benefiting from the UNIX underpinnings of Mac OS X, get used to 
doing things with the keyboard. Although mouse skills can be applied to 
UNIX, you’ll generally find performing UNIX functions faster and easier with 
the keyboard.

690
Why Use the Keyboard?
UNIX keyboarding is fast
Why on Earth would any red-blooded MacBook owner want to leave the 
comfort of the trackpad to use a keyboard? After all, the graphical user 
interface is what made the Macintosh great in the first place. With the 
Finder, you can navigate and manage the various files on your hard drive 
with a few clicks. This sounds simple enough, but for some tasks, using the 
keyboard can be just as fast, if not faster.
Suppose, for example, that you need to copy a file from somewhere on your 
hard drive to somewhere else on that same drive. To do so with the Finder, 
you must first open a Finder window (by clicking the Finder icon in the 
Dock or by double-clicking a drive icon on your Desktop). Then, by using a 
succession of trackpad clicks, you navigate to where the file that you wish to 
copy resides. Next, you might open another Finder window and navigate to the 
folder where you wish to copy the file. (Note that opening the second Finder 
window requires pressing Ô+N or choosing File➪New Finder Window; 
clicking the Finder icon in the Dock doesn’t open a second Finder window.) 
Finally, you duplicate the original file and drag that copy to its intended 
destination.
Comparatively, by using the keyboard and the power of UNIX, you can 
accomplish the same task with a one-line command. For some tasks, your 
trackpad (or a USB mouse) is definitely the way to go, but you can perform 
some other tasks just as quickly, if not faster, with the keyboard. For 
the skinny on one-line commands, skip down to the upcoming section 
“Uncovering the Terminal.”
The UNIX keyboard is a powerful beast
So maybe you’re not an expert typist, and using the trackpad still sounds 
inviting. For many scenarios, you’d be correct in assuming that a “pointing 
thing” can handle the job just as quickly and easily as a bunch of commands 
that you have to memorize. Using the keyboard, however, offers some other 
distinct advantages over the trackpad. To allow you to control your computer 
from the keyboard, all UNIX operating systems offer the command line tool. 
With this tool, you can enter commands one line at a time: hence, its name. 
Mac OS X ships with the command line application, Terminal. You can find 
it here:
/Applications/Utilities/Terminal
One shining feature of the command line is its efficiency. To wit: When you 
use a trackball or mouse, one click is equal to one command. When you use 
the command line, on the other hand, you aren’t limited to entering one 
command at a time; rather, you can combine commands into a kind of 
super-command (minus the silly cape, but with bulging muscles intact), with 
each command performing some action of the combined whole. By using the 
command line, you can string together a whole bunch of commands to do a 
very complex task.

Book IX
Chapter 1
Using UNIX on Your 
MacBook
691
Why Use the Keyboard?
For example, consider how many times you’d have to click in the Finder to 
do the following:
 
1. Find all files that begin with the letters MyDocument.
 
2. From this list of files, add a number to the beginning of the filename, 
indicating its size in kilobytes.
 
3. Save the names of all altered files to a text file.
By using the command line, you could accomplish all these tasks by typing 
only one super-command: that is, a collection of three simple commands 
combined to form one instruction. The built-in Terminal program that ships 
with Mac OS X Snow Leopard gives you everything that you need to start 
using the command line. I show you how in the section “Uncovering the 
Terminal,” later in this chapter.
 
Delving further into super-commands isn’t for the faint-hearted; things get 
pretty ugly pretty quickly, and this chapter can only show you the very 
beginning of the UNIX Yellow Brick Road. Therefore, if your thirst for UNIX 
dominance so compels you, I invite you to do a little independent study 
to bone up on the operating system. Pick up a copy of the great book of 
lore entitled UNIX For Dummies, 5th Edition, written by John R. Levine and 
Margaret Levine Young (Wiley).
Go where no trackpad has gone before
The Finder is generally a helpful thing, but it makes many assumptions about 
how you work. One of these assumptions is that you don’t have any need to 
handle some of the files on your hard drive. As I mention in Book III, Chapter 
6, Mac OS X ships with its system files marked Off Limits, and I generally 
agree with that policy (which keeps anyone from screwing up the delicate 
innards of Mac OS X). To secure your system files, Apple purposely hides 
some files from view.
But what road do you take if you actually need to view or modify those 
system files? Yep, you guessed it: The command line comes to the rescue! 
You can use the command line to peer inside every nook and cranny of your 
MacBook’s vast directory structure on your hard drive. It also has the power 
to edit files that aren’t normally accessible to you. With the command line, 
you can pretend to be other users — even users with more permissions. 
By temporarily acting as another more powerful user, you can perform 
actions with the command line that would be impossible in the Finder. (Just 
remember to make sure that you know exactly what you’re doing, or you’re 
working with an Apple technical support person — a wrong move, and it’ll 
be time for an Ominous Chord.)

692
Why Use the Keyboard?
Automate to elevate
If all these benefits are beginning to excite you, hold on to your socks! Not 
only can you perform complex commands with the command line, you can 
go even one step further: automation. If you find yourself using the same set 
of commands more than once, you’re a likely candidate for using automation 
to save time. Instead of typing the list of commands each time, you can 
save them to a text file and execute the entire file with only one command. 
Now that’s power, right up there with the dynamic duo of AppleScript and 
Automator!
Of course, you probably don’t like doing housekeeping tasks while you’re 
busy on other things, so schedule that list of commands to run in the middle 
of the night while you’re fast asleep. UNIX lets you do that, too, using the 
launchd command.
 
Note that automation of UNIX commands is totally separate from automation 
of Mac OS X applications with AppleScript and Automator, which I cover in 
Book IX, Chapter 2.
Remote control
“So, Mark, the command line is the cat’s meow for efficiently accessing and 
working with files on my MacBook, and I can use it to automate many opera-
tions. Anything else?” I’m glad you asked! By using the command line, you 
can also send commands to another computer anywhere in the world (as 
long as you know the right login and password). After you log into another 
computer, you can use the same commands for the remote computer.
UNIX was created with multiple users in mind. Because computers used to 
be expensive (and honking huge machines to boot), UNIX was designed so 
that multiple users could remotely use the same machine simultaneously. In 
fact, if Mac OS X is your first encounter with UNIX, you might be surprised to 
know that many UNIX beginners of the past weren’t even in the same room, 
building, state, or even country as the computer that they were using.
Not only can you work with a computer that’s in a different physical location, 
but it’s also very fast to do so. Instead of the bandwidth hog that is the 
Internet, the command line is lean and mean. This permits you to use a 
remote computer nearly as fast as if it were sitting on the desk in front of 
you. (This is a great advantage for road warriors who need to tweak a Web 
or an e-mail server from a continent away.)

Uncovering the Terminal
Uncovering the Terminal
The best way to find out how to use command line is to jump right in. 
Mac OS X comes stocked with an application named Terminal. The Terminal 
application is where you enter commands in the command line. It’s located 
in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder on your hard drive — 
choose Applications➪Utilities.
Double-click the icon, as shown in Figure 1-1, to launch Terminal.
 
Figure 1-1: 
Find the 
Terminal 
application 
in your 
Utilities 
folder.
 
 
By the way, feel free to make Terminal more accessible by dragging its icon 
to the Dock or the toolbar. That way, you won’t have to dive this deep into 
the Applications folder in the future.
What’s a prompt?
Upon launch of the Terminal application, you’ll immediately notice some 
text in the window that appears on-screen:
Last login: Sun Jun 23 17:51:14 on console
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
As you might guess, this text details the last time that you logged into the 
Terminal. The last line, however, is the more important one. It’s called the 
prompt.

694
Uncovering the Terminal
The prompt serves some important functions. First, it lists the current 
directory, which is listed as ~. A tilde character (~) denotes a user’s 
Home directory. By default, you’re always in your Home folder each time 
you begin a new session on the Terminal. After the current directory, the 
Terminal displays the name of the current user, which is markchambers in 
this example.
The final character of the prompt is a $. Consider this your cue because 
immediately after this character is where you enter any command that you 
wish to execute. Go ahead; don’t be shy. Try out your first command by 
typing uptime in the Terminal application. (It’s a good idea to type UNIX 
commands in lowercase.) Your text appears at the location of the cursor, 
denoted by a small square. If you make a mistake while entering the command, 
press the Delete key to back up and then type the characters again. (If the 
typing error is stuck deep in a longer command, press the left- or right-arrow 
key to move the cursor immediately after the incorrect character and press 
Delete to back up; then type the correct characters.) After you type the 
command, press Return to execute it.
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ uptime
6:24PM  up  2:42, 4 users, load averages: 2.44, 2.38, 1.90
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
If all goes well, you should see a listing of how long your Mac has been 
running since the last reboot or login. In the example listing, the computer 
has been running for 2 hours and 42 minutes (2:42 in line 2). Simple, eh? 
Immediately following the listing of the uptime command, the Terminal 
displays another prompt for you to enter more commands. I examine many 
more commands later in this chapter.
 
Prefer a different appearance for the Terminal window? Click the Terminal 
menu and choose Preferences; then click the Settings toolbar button to 
choose the color combinations for the Terminal window background and text.
A few commands to get started
Using the command line is simply a matter of entering simple instructions — 
or commands — into the Terminal application and pressing Return to 
execute them. It’s easy to use the command line to navigate through the 
various folders on your hard drive. You’ll become accustomed to using two 
vital commands: ls and cd. The ls command is shorthand for list, and it 
does just that: It lists the contents of the current directory. Enter ls at your 
prompt, and you should see a listing of your Home folder.
The complementary cd command (lowercase) — which incidentally stands for 
change directory — opens any folder that you specify. It works much the same 
as double-clicking a folder in the Finder: The difference is that following the cd 

Book IX
Chapter 1
Using UNIX on Your 
MacBook
695
Uncovering the Terminal
command, you don’t immediately see all the folder’s content. However, the cd 
command requires a parameter (extra options or information that appear after 
the command) so that your Mac knows which folder to open.
For example, to open the Documents folder that resides in your Home 
directory, type cd Documents and press Return. When you do, you might 
be surprised to see another prompt displayed immediately. So where are all 
the files in the Documents folder? You must enter another command to see 
what items are in the folder that you just opened. Type ls again to see the 
contents of the Documents folder.
 
If you try to open a folder that has a space in its name, make sure to enclose 
the folder’s name in quotation marks, like this:
cd “My Picture Folder”
Read more about using quotation marks in your commands in the upcoming 
section “Command-line gotchas.”
To return to your Home folder in this example, enter a modified version of 
the cd command:
cd ..
This causes your MacBook to move back up the folder hierarchy one 
folder, in this case to your Home directory. By using these three simple 
commands — ls, cd foldername, and cd .. — you can traverse your 
entire hard drive.
 
After you successfully enter a command, you can recall it by pressing the 
up-arrow key. Press the up-arrow key again to see the command prior to 
that, and so forth. This is an extremely useful trick for retyping extra long file 
paths.
Using the skills you already have
Just because the Terminal is text based doesn’t mean that it doesn’t act like 
a good Macintosh citizen. All the usual Mac features that you know and 
love are there for you to use. Copy and Paste functions work as you might 
expect — but only at the prompt position.
Drag-and-drop is also at your disposal. After you play around with the 
Terminal for a while, you’ll find yourself bored to tears typing the long 
paths that represent the files on your hard drive. To automatically enter the 
path of a file or folder to a command, simply drag it to the active Terminal 
window, as shown in Figure 1-2. The file’s full path instantly appears at the

UNIX Commands 101
To use the command line effectively, familiarize yourself with the commands 
that are available to you. After all, how can you use a tool without knowing 
what it can do? Despite having to memorize a few commands, UNIX usually 
makes it easy on you by abbreviating commands, by following a standard 
grammar (so to speak), and by providing you with extensive documentation 
for each command.
Anatomy of a UNIX command
UNIX commands can perform many amazing feats. Despite their vast 
abilities, all commands follow a similar structure:
command <optional flag(s)> <optional operand(s)>
The simplest form of a UNIX command is the command itself. (For a basic 
discussion on UNIX commands such as ls, see the earlier section, “A few 
commands to get started.”) You can expand your use of the ls command by 
appending various flags, which are settings that enable or disable optional 
features for the command. Most flags are preceded by a dash (-) and always 
follow the command. For instance, you can display the contents of a 
directory as a column of names (complete with file details) by tacking on a 
-l flag to the ls command.

UNIX Commands 101
ls –l
Besides flags, UNIX commands sometimes also have operands. An operand 
is something that is acted upon. For example, instead of just entering the ls 
command, which lists the current directory, you can add an operand to list a 
specific directory:
ls ~/Documents/myProject/
 
The tilde (~) denotes the user’s Home directory.
Sometimes a command can take multiple operands, as is the case when 
you copy a file. The two operands represent the source file and the 
destination of the file that you want to copy, separated by a space. The 
following example copies a text file from the Documents folder to the 
Desktop folder by using the cp command (short for copy).
cp ~/Documents/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
You can also combine flags and operands in the same command. This 
example displays the contents of a specific folder in list format:
ls –l ~/Documents/myProject/
Command-line gotchas
In earlier sections, I describe a few simple command-line functions. All these 
commands have something in common: You might not have noticed, but 
every example thus far involved folder names and filenames that contained 
only alphanumeric characters. Remember what happens if you have a folder 
name that has a space in it? Try the following example, but don’t worry 
when it doesn’t work.
 
The cd command stands for change directory.
cd /Desktop Folder
The result is an error message:
-bash: cd: /Desktop: No such file or directory
The problem is that a space character isn’t allowed in a path. To get around 
this problem, simply enclose the path in double quotation marks, like this:
cd “/Desktop Folder”
 
Mac OS X lets you use either double or single quotation marks to enclose 
a path with spaces in it. Standard UNIX operating systems, however, use 
double quotation marks for this purpose.

698
UNIX Commands 101
In a similar vein, you can get the space character to be accepted by a 
command by adding an escape character. To escape a character, add a 
backslash (\) immediately prior to the character in question. To illustrate, 
try the last command with an escape character instead. Note that this time, 
no quotation marks are necessary.
cd /Desktop\ Folder
 
You can use either quotation marks or escape characters because they’re 
interchangeable.
Help is on the way!
By now, you might be wondering how a computer techno-wizard is supposed 
to keep all these commands straight. Fortunately, you can find generous 
documentation for nearly every command available to you. To access this 
built-in help, use the man command. Using the man command (shorthand for 
manual) will display a help file for any command that it knows about. For 
example, to read the available help information for the ls command, simply 
type man ls at the prompt. Figure 1-3 illustrates the result.
 
Figure 1-3: 
Use the 
man 
command to 
display help 
information.
 
Autocompletion
To speed things along, the bash shell can automagically complete your 
input for you while you type. Although the Terminal permits you to enter 
commands via the keyboard, it is the shell that interprets those commands. 
Many kinds of shells are available to UNIX users. The shell that Snow 
Leopard uses by default is bash — another common shell is tcsh. Use the 
autocompletion features of bash to autocomplete both commands and 
filenames. To demonstrate, begin by typing the following:

Book IX
Chapter 1
Using UNIX on Your 
MacBook
699
Working with Files
cd ~/De
Then press the Tab key. The result is that the shell predicts that you will 
want to type
cd ~/Desktop/
Of course, if you have another folder that begins with the letters De in the 
same folder, you might need to type a few additional characters. This gives 
the autocompletion feature more information to help it decide which 
characters you want to type. In other words, if you don’t type enough 
characters, autocompletion ends up like a detective without enough clues to 
figure things out.
Working with Files
If you’ve used a computer for any time at all, you’re no doubt familiar with 
the idea of files. Even before the first floppy drive appeared in personal 
computers, operating systems have stored data in files . . . they date back to 
the days when a mainframe computer occupied an entire floor of an office 
building. Mac OS X is no exception, and it’s important to understand how 
Mac OS X arranges them into folders and how you go about accessing 
them via the command line. This section describes the basic file and folder 
information that you need to know to tame the beast that is UNIX.
Paths
Before you dive into UNIX commands, you should first know a few facts . . . 
nasty things, facts, but you can’t earn your pair of techno-wizard suspenders 
without ’em. For starters, as a Mac user, you might not be familiar with how 
paths work in UNIX. A path is simply a textual representation of a folder or 
file. The simplest path is your Home directory, which is denoted by a tilde 
character (~) — the tilde character acts as the equivalent of /Users/<your 
short account name> (in my case, /Users/markchambers). Any folder 
within the Home directory is represented by the folder’s name preceded by 
a forward slash (/). For example, a document entitled myDoc that resides in 
the current user’s Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myDoc
Similarly, a folder named myFolder that resides in the current user’s 
Documents folder would have a path like this:
~/Documents/myFolder/
 
As you’ve probably surmised, a folder and a directory are two different 
names for the same thing. Folder is the name with which most Mac users are 
familiar, and directory is a term that UNIX power users prefer. I use the terms 
interchangeably throughout the remainder of the chapter.

700
Working with Files
Because Mac OS X is a multiuser environment — and your applications and 
files may be located in many different folders across your hard drive — you 
will want to work with folders or files somewhere other than in your Home 
folder. Starting from your Home folder, enter the following command:
cd ..
This moves you to the folder right above your Home folder, which happens 
to be the Users folder. Using another quick ls command will show you all 
users who are permitted to use the machine. (By the way, Shared isn’t a 
user — it’s a folder with privileges set so that any user can access its 
contents.)
Enter cd .. once again, and you find yourself at the root of your main hard 
drive. The root directory is what you see in the Finder when you double-click 
your hard drive icon on the Desktop. A user’s Home directory is represented 
by a tilde character (~), and the root of the hard drive is denoted by a forward 
slash (/), as displayed by the prompt:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$
It’s easy to return to your Home directory by following this sequence:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd Users
WHITEDRAGON:/Users markchambers$ cd markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
Here’s a faster way. Instead of moving through each successive folder until 
you reach your intended destination, you can specify the path by using just 
one cd command:
WHITEDRAGON:/ markchambers$ cd /Users/markchambers
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$
 
Of course, the Home directory is a special folder in that you can also 
navigate there by simply entering cd ~, but the main point here is that 
you can navigate directly to specific folders by using that folder’s path in 
conjunction with the cd command.
Furthermore, when you navigate your hard drive by using paths, you can 
jump directly to your desired destination from any place. When you enter 
cd .., it is in relation to your current position, whereas entering
cd /Users/markchambers
will always take you to the same directory, regardless of your starting point.

Working with Files
Copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files
After you’re comfortable with moving around the hierarchy of your hard 
drive, it’s a cinch to copy, move, and rename files and folders.
To copy files from the command line, use the cp command. Because using 
the cp command will copy a file from one place to another, it requires two 
operands: first the source and then the destination. For instance, to copy a 
file from your Home folder to your Documents folder, use the cp command 
like this:
cp ~/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyDocument
 
Keep in mind that when you copy files, you must have proper permissions 
to do so! Here’s what happens when I try to copy a file from my Desktop to 
another user’s Desktop (strangely named fuadramses):
WHITEDRAGON:~ markchambers$ cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/
fuadramses/Desktop/MyDocument
Denied! Thwarted! Refused!
cp: /Users/fuadramses /Desktop/MyDocument: Permission denied
If you can’t copy to the destination that you desire, you need to precede the 
cp command with sudo. Using the sudo command allows you to perform 
functions as another user. The idea here is that the other user whom you’re 
“emulating” has the necessary privileges to execute the desired copy 
operation. When you execute the command, the command line asks you for 
a password. If you don’t know what the password is, you probably shouldn’t 
be using sudo. Your computer’s administrator should have given you an 
appropriate password to use. After you enter the correct password, the 
command executes as desired.
 
In case you’re curious, sudo stands for set user and do. It sets the user to the 
one that you specify and performs the command that follows the username.
sudo cp ~/Desktop/MyDocument /Users/fuadramses/Desktop/
MyDocument
Password:
A close cousin to the cp (copy) command is the mv (move) command. As 
you can probably guess, the mv command moves a folder or file from one 
location to another. (I told you that all this character-based stuff would start 
to make sense, didn’t I?) To demonstrate, this command moves MyDocument 
from the Desktop folder to the current user’s Home folder:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/MyDocument

702
Working with Files
Ah, but here’s the hidden surprise: The mv command also functions as 
a rename command. For instance, to rename a file MyDocument on the 
Desktop to MyNewDocument, do this:
mv ~/Desktop/MyDocument ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
In this case, you can see that the mv command is really copying the original 
file to the destination and then deleting the original. Because both folders in 
this example reside in the same folder (~/Desktop/), it appears as though 
the mv command has renamed the file.
Again, like the cp command, the mv command requires that you have proper 
permissions for the action that you want to perform. Use the sudo com-
mand to perform any commands that your current user (as displayed in 
the prompt) isn’t allowed to execute. On UNIX systems, not all users are 
necessarily equal. Some users can perform functions that others can’t. This 
is handy for keeping your child’s mitts off important files on your laptop. It 
also creates a hurdle should you choose to work on files while using your 
child’s restricted user account. The sudo command lets you temporarily 
become another user — presumably one that has permission to perform 
some function that the current user can’t.
What would file manipulation be without the ability to delete files? Never 
fear; UNIX can delete anything that you throw at it. Use the rm (short for 
remove) or rmdir (short for remove directory) command to delete a folder 
or file. For example, to delete MyNewDocument from the Desktop folder, 
execute the rm command like this:
rm ~/Desktop/MyNewDocument
 
Once again, deleting files and folders requires that you have permission 
to do so. In other words, any time that you manipulate files with the 
command line, you’re required to have the proper permission. If your 
current user lacks these permissions, using sudo helps. You should also 
check to make sure that your target is correctly spelled and that no pesky 
spaces that could wreak carnage are lurking in the command.
Opening documents and launching applications
Launching applications and opening documents is child’s play for a UNIX 
pro like you. The open command does it all. For example, to bring the Finder 
to the foreground without touching the mouse, use
open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
To open a document from the command line, follow a similar scheme. 
For example, to view an image named myImage.tif that’s stored in your 
Documents folder using the default application (typically Preview), try this:
open ~/Documents/myImage.tif

Useful Commands
Manipulating files and viewing folder content is fun, but the command line is 
capable of so much more! Now I focus your attention on some of the other 
useful tasks that you can perform with the command line.
 
Mac OS X comes stocked with a full set of useful commands. You can 
discover what commands are installed by viewing the files in /usr/bin. 
Type cd /usr/bin to navigate there.
Calendar
One of my favorite command-line functions is the cal command, which 
displays a calendar in text form. Simply entering cal at the prompt displays a 
calendar for the current month, as shown in Figure 1-4.
 
Figure 1-4: 
Type cal 
to view a 
calendar for 
the current 
month.
 
Append a number to the cal command to display a 12-month calendar for 
that year. The number that follows the cal command is the year for which 
you’d like to see a calendar. For example, to view a calendar for 1970, type 
cal 1970. The result appears in Figure 1-5.
Append a month number and a year number to display the calendar for that 
month. For example, to view a calendar for April 2010, type cal 04 2010.
 
Use the –m flag to specify the current year, as in cal –m 08 for August of 
this year.
Another useful command that’s related to the cal command is date. Type 
date at the command line to display the day, date, time, and year based on 
your computer’s settings.

Processes
Have you ever been curious as to why your hard drive seems to spin and 
grind on occasion while your system is seemingly inactive? Mac OS X 
sometimes has a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. To discover just 
what your computer is busy doing at any time, use the top command to 
display all the actions that your computer is currently performing, as shown 
in Figure 1-6. These activities are called processes; some are created when 
you launch applications, and others are simply tasks that Mac OS X has to 
take care of to keep things running smoothly.
Besides listing the names of the various processes currently in use, top tells 
you how much of your CPU is being devoted to each process. This lets you 
know what process is currently hogging all your computing power.
Sometimes a process stalls, effectively freezing that action. By using the top 
command to find the Process ID (PID) of the offending process, you can halt 
the process. Simply use the kill command followed by the PID of the 
process that you want to stop. (The man help page for the kill command 
gives more options that may help terminate stubborn processes with 
prejudice.)

Figure 1-6:

Do not go killing processes with a cavalier attitude! Although Mac OS X is 
extremely stable, removing the wrong process — such as init or mach_
init — is rather like removing a leg from one of those deep-sea drilling 
platforms: the very definition of Not Good. You could lock up your system 
and lose whatever you’re doing in other applications. If you simply want 
to shut down a misbehaving program, go graphical again (at least for a 
moment) and use the Force Quit menu command from the Finder menu.
Like top, another handy command for examining process info is ps 
(short for process). Most often, you’ll want to append a few flags to the ps 
command to get the information that you desire. For example, try the 
following command:
ps –aux
The man page for ps explains what each flag means. (Read more about using 
the man command in the earlier section “Help is on the way!”)
UNIX Cadillac Commands
Besides working with files and processes, the command line has all kinds 
of sophisticated commands. For example, with the command line, you have 
instant access to a variety of tools for finding files or even stringing together 
commands.

706
UNIX Cadillac Commands
Finding files
The command line gives you a number of ways to search for files on your 
hard drive. The two most commonly used commands are find and locate.
To use find, specify a starting point for the search followed by the name of 
the file or folder that you want to find. For example, to find the Fonts folder 
that belongs to your user, enter the command like this:
find ~/ -name “Fonts”
You should see at least one result of the find command.
/Users/markchambers//Library/Fonts
One great feature of the find command is that you can look for a file or 
folder in more than one location. Suppose you want to find a file named 
MyDocument that you know resides either in your Documents folder or on 
your Desktop. For this kind of search, use the find command like this:
find ~/Documents ~/Desktop -name “MyDocument”
In this example, you are telling the find command which folders it should 
search when looking for the file named MyDocument.
Using pipes
Nearly all UNIX commands can take on greater abilities by using a construct 
called the pipe. A pipe (|) is represented by that funny little vertical line that 
shows up when you press Shift+\. The pipe routes data from one command 
to another one that follows — for example, many UNIX commands produce 
large amounts of information that can’t all fit on one page. (You might have 
noticed this behavior if you’ve used the locate command.) Joining two 
commands or functions together with the pipe command is piping. To tame 
the screens full of text, pipe the find function to the less command. The 
less command provides data one page at a time.
find ~/ -name “Fonts” | less
When the results fill up one page, the data stops and waits for you to press 
any key (except the Q key) to continue. When you reach the end of the 
results, press Q to quit and return to a command-line prompt.

UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
As a MacBook user, you might be surprised to know that many applications 
on your hard drive don’t reside in one of the typical Applications folders of 
Mac OS X. These applications, in fact, don’t have any graphical user interface 
like what you’re accustomed to. They’re accessible only from the command 
line. The remainder of this chapter covers some of these applications.
Text editors
UNIX has many text-editing applications for use at the command line. Some 
of the more popular ones include pico, vi, and emacs. Each of these text 
editors has its pros and cons — and say thanks to the thorough folks at 
Apple, because all three are included with Snow Leopard! For my examples 
here, however, I use pico because it’s simple to use and sufficient for our 
needs.
Creating a new document
To create a text file by using pico, simply type pico at the command line. 
The result looks like Figure 1-7.
 
Figure 1-7: 
The pico 
program 
is a full-
strength text 
editor, right 
from the 
command 
line.
 
 
This is the rough-and-tumble world of UNIX, which preceded the Macintosh 
by many years. Perhaps this will also help you to appreciate why the 
Macintosh was so revolutionary when it was introduced. (You can just hear 
the designers crowing, “We’ll call this a menu! Yeah, that’s the ticket!” The 
only graphics that you’d see on your monitor were the comics and sticky 
notes that you stuck to the bottom.)

708
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
At the bottom of the screen is a menu of common commands. Above the 
menu is a large, empty space where you can enter text, much the same as in 
the word processors that you already know and love. (For those of us that 
remember the halcyon character-based days of DOS, think older versions of 
Word and WordPerfect . . . or, if you’re a real computing dinosaur as I am, 
consider the original WordStar.) Type some text in that area. Anything will 
do . . . a letter to a friend, a grocery list, or your school homework.
When you’re finished entering your desired text, save the document with 
the WriteOut command in the pico menu. Directly next to each command 
in the pico menu is a keyboard sequence used to perform that command. 
(Refer to the bottom of Figure 1-7.) The # character is shorthand for the 
Control key on your keyboard. Thus, to save a file, press Control+O. This 
flies in the face of standard Mac keyboard conventions, where the letter O is 
traditionally used to mean Open.
After pressing the Control+O sequence, pico prompts you for a filename. 
Like most UNIX files, you’re permitted to enter a simple filename here or a 
full path to a file. For this example, save the file to your Documents folder, 
naming it MyPicoDocument.
After you’ve completed and saved the document, pressing Control+X will 
transport you away from Planet Pico and back to the command line.
Networking with the Terminal
Because UNIX isn’t a new phenomenon, it has many useful networking 
abilities built into it. In fact, UNIX was instrumental in creating much of what 
we now take for granted: e-mail, the Internet, and the World Wide Web. Thus, 
you’ll be happy to know that you can communicate over networks with the 
Terminal in practically any manner that you can dream of . . . and then some!
WWW and FTP
If you’ve used the Internet for any time, you’re probably familiar with the 
various means to transport data over a network. From FTP (short for File 
Transfer Protocol) and Telnet to e-mail and the Web, UNIX can handle it all. In 
fact, UNIX has a command for each of these functions (and many more that 
have passed into historical obscurity). Rather than use each individual 
command to send and retrieve data with the Terminal, Apple has conveniently 
provided a command that can handle them all: curl. The curl command is 
competent at all the standard network protocols. To see it in action, pass a 
Web address (or URL, to The Enlightened) to the curl command:
curl http://www.mlcbooks.com

Book IX
Chapter 1
Using UNIX on Your 
MacBook
709
UNIX Programs That Come in Handy
The result is that you see the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) page 
that’s located at www.mlcbooks.com. Because this isn’t particularly useful 
for most people (it’s not very easy to read), you need to add the letter o as a 
flag. This specifies where you would like to save this file upon download. To 
save the HTML page to your Home directory, add the -o flag and a path to 
the destination file.
 
Don’t forget to precede all flags with a hyphen. For this example, it would be -o.
curl -o ~/mlcbooks.html http://www.mlcbooks.com
If you now perform an ls command, you see that curl has, in fact, 
downloaded the HTML found at www.mlcbooks.com and saved it to a file 
named mlcbooks.html in your Home directory.
The beauty of curl is that it does much more than just retrieve Web pages: 
It’s equally comfortable with FTP transfers. FTP is used to download (or 
receive) files from a server as well as upload (or send) them. Like the previous 
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) examples, you only have to provide 
an FTP address in Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format, and curl will 
take care of the rest. Of course, most people want to save any files that they 
download via FTP — not view them in the Terminal as I did the HTML file. 
Therefore, as in the previous example, you should add the -o flag and a path 
to the destination of your download. This time, I download a README file 
about curl directly from the makers of curl.
curl -o ~/Desktop/README.curl ftp://ftp.sunet.se/pub/www/
utilities/curl/README.curl
If you’re familiar with FTP, you might wonder whether curl can upload, too. 
Yes, indeed! Instead of using the -o flag, you need to use two flags: -T and -u. 
The -T flag denotes which file you want to upload. The -u flag denotes 
the username and password. Then, specify the FTP destination address of 
where you want to upload it. Because this example deals with an upload, the 
remainder of this example is for an imaginary FTP server. In real life, you’d 
use the appropriate FTP address, username, and password for an FTP server 
where you are allowed to upload.
curl -T /Desktop/README.curl -u username:passwd ftp://ftp.
yoursitehere.com
/myfiles/README.curl
This example uploads the README.curl file from the Desktop folder that I 
downloaded earlier to an imaginary FTP server.

How do you spell success? C-u-r-l!
Sure, HTTP and FTP are handy, but did you know that there are many 
other protocols for network communications? One of the niftier ones is the 
Dictionary protocol. With it, you can look up words from any server that 
understands the protocol. Suppose, for example, that you want to know the 
meaning of the term DVD. Enter the following command to find out:
curl dict://dict.org/d:DVD
With curl, Dictionary, and your Dictionary Dashboard widget on the same 
MacBook, you might never use a “real” paper dictionary again!

sing a Macintosh is supposed to make your life easier — and in many 
ways, it does. But there’s a limit to how much your MacBook can do 
by itself, right? After all, you still have to move your finger on the trackpad, 
press keys on the keyboard, and read information on the screen to get 
things done . . . or do you? Why not let your computer do the dull chores — 
such as renaming a thousand digital photographs from your family vacation 
and organizing them into folders based on the subject of each photo — for 
you? Although most people are familiar with controlling their MacBooks 
with the trackpad and keyboard, few realize that they can operate their 
machines without touching a key or a button, or even glancing at the screen.
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
If one word could describe what AppleScript is all about, it’d be automation. 
AppleScript is a technology for automating practically any action that you 
perform with your MacBook, including both common tasks in the Finder and 
those that you perform in other applications.
Automate common tasks in the Finder
If you’ve ever found yourself repeating some task more than once, you’re an 
ideal candidate for becoming an AppleScript techno-wizard. AppleScript is 
particularly good at taking the boredom and tedium out of using your laptop 
by performing all sorts of tasks automatically. To illustrate, consider a few 
jobs that would take a fair amount of time to do by hand but are a snap with 
AppleScript:

712
What’s So Great about AppleScript?
 
✦ While writing your next best-selling Great American Novel — or For 
Dummies book on Mac OS X — you make a mistake and misnumber the 
chapters. All the chapters have a filename bearing the chapter number, 
but they’re all off by one. Sure, you could rename each file by hand, 
but your book is a large tome and renumbering 42 chapters manually 
doesn’t sound like much fun. (Take my word for it. Please.) It’ll require 
several minutes and lots of tedious attention on your part, not to 
mention introduce the likelihood of human error. But wait, there’s 
another way! When using a simple AppleScript of only a few lines of 
code, you can rename the chapters in seconds whilst you go grab 
another Diet Coke.
 
✦ You’re a neat individual and think that your MacBook should reflect 
your penchant for order — in fact, you like your Desktop icons to be 
placed just so. Being left-handed, you prefer the icons over on the left 
side of the Desktop, like some of those inferior operating systems. In this 
situation, an AppleScript can help you do things that aren’t humanly 
possible; not only can you rapidly rearrange the icons on your Desktop, 
but you can do so with pixel-point accuracy. Without AppleScript, it’d be 
nearly impossible to precisely align dozens of icons. And if you could, it 
would take a long time and probably cause you to go blind.
 
✦ After a font-download binge, you find yourself with hundreds of fonts. 
You really want to organize them into separate folders based on the 
date that you downloaded them. AppleScript comes to the rescue again! 
With a brief script, you could knock out this challenge without ever 
looking at a single date. Add a couple more lines of code to the script, 
and AppleScript will take care of creating the folders, too. Right, you 
know the word: sassy.
Automate tasks in other applications
By using AppleScript, you can also often automate your work from beginning 
to end, despite the fact that you need multiple applications to do so. Look 
at a few scenarios, and you’ll begin to appreciate why AppleScript is such a 
powerful technology:
 
✦ You’ve just completed creating the ultimate library of bagpipe songs in 
iTunes — no, really! — and you want to share the list with your friends 
at the next Bagpipers Anonymous meeting. You could easily send 
everyone in the group an iTunes Playlist, but not everyone in the club 
has a Macintosh, let alone a computer. This is going to require creating 
a hard copy for those members without a computer. Because your bag-
pipe song list contains thousands of songs, you don’t want to retype the 
name of each song. AppleScript can save the day by extracting the song 
titles for you and compiling them into a list just in time for your meeting.
 
✦ AppleScript can take care of your computer-owning bagpipe friends, too. 
With a few extra steps, you can e-mail all of them the list as well.

Running a Script
 
✦ Being so doggone fond of bagpipes, you want to send your bagpiping 
friends a special note during the holidays. To help manage your holiday 
greeting cards, you can create a record in FileMaker Pro or some other 
database listing the name and address of each person who should 
receive a card. If you’ve entered their street addresses in the Contacts 
section of your e-mail application, AppleScript can aid in transferring 
the addresses from your e-mail application to the database. Never again 
will your bagpiping friends miss a holiday greeting . . . and the world is a 
much better place.
As you can imagine, there are literally thousands of ways that you can use 
AppleScript to automate your workflow. (Whoops, I just used a BST, or 
Business Software Term. A workflow is a single document or project that one 
or more people work on using multiple applications. In other words, your 
document can be automatically manipulated in multiple applications using 
the same script.) 
Running a Script
The easiest way to get started with AppleScript is to use some scripts that 
others have written already. Scripts are small files that contain a list of 
commands; this list of commands tells your Mac what function to perform 
and when to perform it. Fortunately, Apple is kind enough to provide you 
with several completed scripts with your installation of Snow Leopard. You 
can find a large cache of scripts in the scripts folder, found in the Library 
folder, under Scripts.
Many scripts (but not all) end with the extension .scpt. Before you get 
started running scripts, however, you should know a few things.
Identifying scripts in the field
Each script that you encounter will be in one of these three formats:
 
✦ Script application: Some AppleScripts act much like an application. To 
use one, simply double-click it in the Finder, and off it goes to perform 
whatever tasks it was meant to do. Depending on an internal setting of 
the script, it might quit when it’s finished doing its thing. Most often, the 
script completes its mission and quits. Scripts are typically identified by 
the icon that you see in Figure 2-1.
 
✦ Compiled script: You might also encounter AppleScripts that won’t 
run without the aid of another application. Apple calls these compiled 
scripts. Although they can’t execute on their own, they do have the 
abilities of a script built in. They just require a host application to 
use them.

714

of typical 
script icons

the camera.
 
 
✦ Text file: In addition to compiled scripts and those that act like 
applications, a third category of AppleScript that you might encounter 
is a script stored in a text file. Scripts that are stored in a text file also 
need a host application before they’ll do anything. The main difference 
between a text file script and a compiled script is that you can read a 
text file script with any application that can open a text file.
The AppleScript Editor application
Two of the three possible script types (compiled scripts and text files) 
require some sort of host application before they’ll perform any action. 
Luckily, Snow Leopard provides you with just such a host: the AppleScript 
Editor application, which comes with Mac OS X and can execute any 
AppleScript with ease. With the AppleScript Editor, you can also do much 
more, including
 
✦ View or modify an AppleScript
 
✦ Create a new AppleScript
 
✦ Check an AppleScript for errors
 
✦ Save scripts in one of the three possible formats
To launch the AppleScript Editor application, navigate to the Utilities folder 
(open your Applications folder and then open the Utilities folder) and 
double-click the AppleScript Editor icon. The AppleScript Editor application 
displays an empty, script-editing window, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Executing a script
After you have the AppleScript Editor application running, you can run any 
AppleScript that you can find. To get you started, Apple has conveniently 
provided a handful of useful scripts. Navigate to the Scripts folder, which is 
located in the Library folder.

Book IX
Chapter 2

Running a Script
 
The scripts are divided into folders based on functionality, such as fonts, 
mail, and navigation. For example, open the Font Book folder, where you’ll 
find a script named Delete Empty Collections.scpt.

Double-click the script to open it. Because it’s a compiled script and not 
an application script, the AppleScript Editor automatically loads the script 
and comes to the foreground (see Figure 2-3). This particular script opens 
the Font Book application and checks for empty font collections. If any are 
found, the script displays a prompt asking for confirmation and then deletes 
the empty collection if you click the OK button. To see the script in action, 
click the Run button or press Ô+R.

Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
Using someone else’s scripts is fun and all, but the real joy of AppleScript 
comes when you create your own. Not only can you customize a script to 
your own needs and desires, but saving all those keystrokes can really 
produce a feeling of euphoria. (Okay, perhaps just Snow Leopard power 
users will actually experience a heightened sense of existence . . . you’ll be 
there soon.)
Create a script without touching a key
You needn’t wear a pocket protector or tape the bridge of your glasses to 
become proficient with AppleScript. In fact, the AppleScript Editor can get 
you up and running with AppleScript in no time at all. The secret weapon of 
the AppleScript author is the Record function of the AppleScript Editor. 
You click the Record button, perform one or more actions in a recordable 
application, and then return to the AppleScript Editor, where you click the 
Stop button. The AppleScript Editor stores each of your actions and 
compiles the whole list into an AppleScript.
 
In theory, this is how it should all work, but in reality, finding recordable 
Macintosh applications isn’t always so easy. The Finder is, perhaps, the 
most recordable application on the MacBook. Although some other 
applications support recording, so few do that the Finder could be the only 
recordable application most Mac users ever see.
To try it yourself, take the following steps to automate actions in the Finder:
 
1. Bring AppleScript Editor to the foreground.
 
 If AppleScript Editor isn’t currently running, double-click its icon in a 
Finder window. If it is running, click its icon in the Dock.
 
2. Create a new script by pressing Ô+N.
 
3. Click the Record button.
 
 The Record button is one of four buttons positioned near the top left of 
a new script window. Refer to Figure 2-3.
 
4. Switch to the Finder and perform the actions that you want to automate.
 
 When the Finder is active, you can select some icons on the Desktop and 
move them around, resize any open Finder windows, or navigate to your 
home directory. Any action that you perform in the Finder should be 
acceptable fodder for the AppleScript Editor. When you perform tasks in 
the Finder, the AppleScript Editor automatically generates a script that 
replicates your actions.

Book IX
Chapter 2
AppleScript Just 
Plain Rocks
717
Writing Your Own Simple Scripts
 
5. Return to the AppleScript Editor and click the Stop button.
 
 To reactivate the AppleScript Editor, click its icon in the Dock. Click the 
Stop button to cease the recording of your script.
When you’re finished, you should be looking at a complete AppleScript. To 
test your work, return to the Finder and return any icons or windows that 
you might have moved or repositioned to their original locations. (You don’t 
want to run a script that doesn’t appear to have any effect.) Then return to 
the AppleScript Editor and click the Run button to watch your automated 
Finder tasks being performed.
Building your own scripts
An AppleScript novice can perform all kinds of amazing feats with the 
recording features of the AppleScript Editor. Because AppleScript uses a 
kind of pseudo-English language, it’s usually pretty easy to figure out what’s 
going on behind the scenes. Consider the following script for an example:
tell app “Finder”
   activate
   set windowList to every window -- save list of open 
windows
   repeat with theWindow in windowList
      tell theWindow
         if collapsed is true then
         -- do nothing, because the window is collapsed
         else
            set collapsed to true
         end if
      end tell
   end repeat
end tell
(By the way, in the preceding code, I bolded and italicized the commands 
you’ll be working with, but they don’t have to be bolded for the script to 
work.) Anyway, the first thing that you might notice about this script is the 
first line: the tell command, which indicates that this script relates to the 
Finder. This script activates the Finder, creates a list of open windows, and 
then examines the state of each window: Is it collapsed or not collapsed? (In 
Snow Leopard, a collapsed, or minimized, window appears in the Dock.)
One of two possible results occurs:
 
✦ If the window is already minimized and in the Dock, nothing happens 
and the script continues through the list of windows.
 
✦ If the window isn’t minimized, the script collapses it.

718
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
This continues until the script has examined all open windows. The end 
result? All open windows end up minimized in the Dock.
Another thing to note about this script is that it has two comments in it 
(save list and do nothing). Comments can help you remember what 
you were thinking months later when you open the script again. Although 
comments help us humans know what’s happening, they don’t really have 
any other function. An AppleScript comment begins with two dashes (--).
Here’s a big-time Mark’s Maxim that every script author should remember:
 
Comments are your friend!
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
Creating AppleScripts can soon become very involved, bordering on 
programming. Don’t let that term programming scare you away, though. 
You needn’t be a software developer to take advantage of AppleScripts. 
Apple provides a lot of help to get you started along the AppleScript trail.
Grab the Dictionary
Perhaps the greatest resource for AppleScript novices and experts alike 
is the AppleScript Dictionary. Although many applications are scriptable, 
not all are. To be scriptable, an application must contain an AppleScript 
Dictionary. An AppleScript Dictionary details the various commands and 
objects of an application that you can access via AppleScript.
The AppleScript Editor application allows you to peer inside an application 
and view its AppleScript Dictionary. To open an application’s Dictionary, 
choose File➪Open Dictionary. Mac OS X searches through your installed 
applications and presents you with the Open Dictionary dialog, as shown in 
Figure 2-4, which lists all applications that have a dictionary and are 
therefore scriptable.
 
If you don’t see your favorite application in the list, alas, it’s probably 
not scriptable. To make certain, click the Browse button and select the 
application in question.
After you select an application and click Choose, the AppleScript Editor 
displays that application’s AppleScript Dictionary. An application’s dictionary 
lists all the features of that application that are scriptable.
Scriptable features are divided into categories, called Suites, which you can 
see on the left side of the AppleScript Dictionary. Every Mac application is 
supposed to support the Standard Suite, which lists common terms that 
most applications should support.

By surveying the various Suites of an application, you begin to see what 
tasks you can automate. The Finder, with its huge AppleScript Dictionary, 
is perhaps the most scriptable of all applications (followed closely by 
mammoths like FileMaker Pro).

720
One Step Beyond: AppleScript Programming
Anatomy of a simple script
Although a full discussion of AppleScript programming is beyond the scope 
of this book — after all, we have other things to talk about, too — that 
doesn’t mean that you can’t produce some quick and useful scripts. Most 
AppleScripts begin with a command that addresses the application that you 
want to automate. Enter this command into a new AppleScript document, 
which you create by pressing Ô+N.
tell application “Finder”
This is like saying, “Hey, Finder, listen up! I’m going to send commands 
your way!” The double quotation marks surround the application name that 
you’re addressing in the command.
Similarly, after you finish instructing the Finder what tasks you want 
performed, you must also tell it to stop listening. As such, typical scripts 
end with
end tell
With the shell of a script in place, all you have to do is add commands 
between the tell and end tell commands of the script. If you want your 
script to force an application to the foreground, an activate command is 
usually the first line within the shell of your script.
tell application “Finder”
  activate
end tell
Believe it or not, this is technically a complete and valid script! It doesn’t 
do much, though, so add some more functionality to make it accomplish 
something worthwhile. For example, suppose you want to perform some 
housekeeping chores each time you log in to your MacBook. Some desirable 
tasks might include
 
✦ Emptying the Trash
 
✦ Having your laptop say “Hello!” to you
(Okay, I’ll grant that hearing your MacBook say “Hello!” isn’t a housekeeping 
chore, but it makes the whole script that much more fun — and really 
impresses your visitors, too. No one ever said programming had to be 
boring!)
To add these functions, you can do so by using a language you already know: 
English. As I mention earlier, Apple tries (and sometimes succeeds) to make 
AppleScript as English-like as possible. That way, you don’t have to know 
some silly computer language; just use your native tongue. For example, to 
empty the Trash, tell the Finder to do so.

empty trash
The trickiest line of code might be the speech, and that’s only because you 
need to remember to add quotation marks. AppleScript thinks that anything 
without quotation marks is an AppleScript command.
say “Hello!”
The result is a super-simple script that anyone can read but that performs 
two powerful functions. The completed script looks like this:
tell app “Finder”
  activate
  empty trash
  say “Hello!”
end tell
After you complete the script, choose File➪Save to save your script. Because 
you want the script to execute and then quit, use the File Format field to 
save it as an Application. Also, make sure that the Stay Open check box and 
the Startup Screen check box are deselected. And don’t forget to name your 
script in the Save As text field.
 
To have the script automatically run each time you log in to your MacBook, 
save the script anywhere you wish. (Assign its location in the Where field 
of the Save window.) Open System Preferences by clicking its icon in the Dock; 
then click the Accounts icon. Make sure that your account is selected and 
then click Login Items. Click the Add button (which proudly bears a plus sign) 
and navigate to your script in the Open dialog that appears. After you click the 
Add button of the Open dialog, you see the script in the Login Items window.
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
Okay, perhaps I’ve watched too much “Iron Chef” over the years. Anyway, 
Snow Leopard features Automator (as shown in Figure 2-6) — he’s your own 
personal robotic AppleScript assistant. In fact, Automator can help you 
create custom applications that can handle your repetitive tasks. Again, 
you’re creating workflows here, which are sequential (and repeatable) 
operations that are performed on the same files or data, and your Automator 
application can automatically launch whatever applications are necessary to 
get the job done.
Here’s a great example: You work with a service bureau that sends you a CD 
every week with new product shots for your company’s Marketing department. 
Unfortunately, these images are flat-out huge — taken with a 12-megapixel 
camera — and they’re always in the wrong orientation. Before you move 
them to the Marketing folder on your server, you have to laboriously resize 
each image and rotate it, and then save the smaller version.

722
I Summon Automator — the Silicon Programmer!
 
Figure 2-6: 
Automator 
is a dream 
come true 
for those 
who hate 
repetitive 
tasks.
 
With Automator’s help, you can build a custom application that automatically 
reads each image in the folder, resizes it, rotates it, and even generates a 
thumbnail image or prints the image, and then moves the massaged images 
to the proper folder. You’d normally have to manually launch Preview to 
perform the image operations and then use a Finder window to move the 
new files to the right location. But now, with Automator, double-clicking 
your custom application icon does the trick.
You’ll find Automator in your Applications folder. Currently, Automator can 
handle specific tasks within about 60 applications (including the Finder), but 
both Apple and third-party developers are busy adding new Automator task 
support to all sorts of new and existing applications.
To create a simple application using Automator, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Custom and click Choose.
 
2. Click the desired application in the Library list.
 
 Automator displays the actions available within that application.
 
3. Drag the desired action from the Library pane to the workflow pane.
 
4. Modify any specific settings provided for the action you chose.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1–3 to complete the workflow.
 
6. Click Run (upper right) to test your script.

Help Is at Your Fingertips
If you want to explore AppleScript further, you have many resources on 
hand. Sometimes the easiest way to use AppleScript is to copy existing 
scripts and modify them as necessary; other times, it’s a good idea to read 
the documentation included in Apple’s Help system. Whichever approach 
you use, with a little practice and guidance, you’ll soon be doing stupendous 
tasks with your MacBook.

724
Help Is at Your Fingertips
Built-in AppleScript Help
The most readily available AppleScript reference is built into Mac OS X. From 
within Automator, choose Help➪Automator Help to launch the Automator 
Help Guide, or choose Help➪AppleScript Help from the AppleScript Editor. 
The latter is a great place to begin your AppleScript exploration. It includes 
detailed documentation about the AppleScript language and loads of demon-
stration scripts for you to try (or alter) yourself.
AppleScript on the Web
In addition to the built-in AppleScript help in the Finder, the Internet has 
much to offer in the way of AppleScript training and examples. As are so 
many other excellent Web resources, AppleScripts are free!
Not all AppleScripts are created equal: When downloading scripts from 
the Internet, make sure that they’re compatible with Snow Leopard 
(Mac OS X v. 10.6).
Apple Computer
The first place on the Web that you should visit for AppleScript help is the 
Source of All That Is Good, also called the Mother Ship: Apple Computer. 
Although the built-in OS X help offers a lot, the Apple Web site offers even 
more scripts, tutorials, and general AppleScript goodness. You can even find 
a list of all known scriptable applications, which can save you from searching 
for them with Script Editor. Furthermore, the site maintains an extensive list 
of links to other useful AppleScript sites.

Automator World
Automator World devotes its site to all Macintosh scripting. Because 
AppleScript is such a huge part of scripting the Mac OS, you can be certain 
that there’s something here for you. Besides offering up-to-date news

with Your MacBook
In This Chapter

✓ Speaking to your MacBook
✓ Having your laptop speak back
✓ Using VoiceOver to provide feedback in Snow Leopard
I
f you’re a hunt-and-peck typist — leaving you certain that there must 
be some better way to get information into your computer — you’ll be 
happy to know that Apple has you in mind. Since the very first Mac rolled 
off the assembly line, Apple has had a keen interest in alternative modes of 
interaction between human and machine. Mac OS X continues in this tradition 
of alternative computer controls, offering two options for controlling Mac 
OS X without the keyboard: handwriting and speech.
 
✦ Handwriting: By using a pen and computer tablet, you can enter text 
into your MacBook by simply writing as you would on a sheet of paper.
 
✦ Speech: Talk to your MacBook to make it listen and obey your commands. 
It even talks back!
This chapter guides you through the various options that you have for 
controlling your laptop without using the keyboard. First, I cover the 
Mac OS X Ink feature, which you use to write on a tablet to enter data into 
your computer. (Although it sounds a bit ironic, think of Ink as your “digital 
paper” for the new millennium.) Whatever you write on the tablet appears 
on the screen as text.
I also give you a look at the more space-age speech capabilities available 
to you in Mac OS X. With your voice, you can command a Macintosh to 
perform all sorts of interesting feats. And just so you don’t get lonely, the 
MacBook even talks back to you. (Now you can control your computer just 
as Spock from “Star Trek” could!) And Snow Leopard’s VoiceOver feature 
makes it easy for your MacBook to read aloud all sorts of text, including 
Web pages, Mail messages, and word processing documents.
So scoot away from your computer, lean that chair back, and let your laptop 
take care of the rest.

726
Using Ink with a Tablet
Using Ink with a Tablet
Typing on a keyboard can be a tedious and error-prone experience for even 
the best typists. To help out, Apple added some useful handwriting features 
to Mac OS X. Based in part on some of Apple’s handheld software for the 
Newton (one of the first personal digital assistants [PDAs] and a product 
released before its time), the handwriting recognition in Mac OS X gives 
you the ability to write text on a compatible tablet for use in your favorite 
applications.
The basic process of working with handwriting on Mac OS X goes like this:
 
1. Attach a tablet to your MacBook.
 
 Most tablets use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, so connecting 
one to your computer is as simple as plugging in the cable from your 
tablet to a USB port on your MacBook.
 
2. Write on the tablet with the stylus that accompanies it.
 
 A stylus is the name given the fake “pen” that accompanies most tablets. 
A stylus doesn’t have any ink in it: It’s just a pen-shaped tool with a 
plastic tip meant for writing on a tablet.
 
3. Your MacBook interprets your handwriting.
 
 After your laptop recognizes the handwriting, it sends that text to the 
foremost application at the cursor location where you would normally 
type with the keyboard. You’re spared the whole training bit, too.
You aren’t restricted to writing just text on the tablet, naturally. You can use 
it to control the interface of your MacBook as you would a mouse. A tablet 
also works great for graphics applications, such as Corel Painter and Adobe 
Photoshop. Many artists are frustrated when drawing with a mouse; when 
you use a tablet, though, you can feel right at home with the natural pen or 
brush movements that you’ve always used, and you can vary the pressure 
on the pad to control the density and spread of a stroke.
Although Snow Leopard takes care of handwriting recognition, it does offer 
you a few settings in the Ink pane within System Preferences. To view the 
System Preferences, click the System Preferences icon in the Dock. From 
there, click the Ink icon to adjust settings for your tablet.
 
If you don’t have a tablet connected to your MacBook, you can’t view the 
System Preferences pane for Ink. Mac OS X is smart enough to show you 
only the settings for your current hardware setup.

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Remember that classic scene from the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage 
Home in which Scotty picks up the mouse on a Macintosh and tries to talk 
directly to the computer? Since the very early days of the Mac OS, Apple has 
included some form of speech recognition in its computers. Snow Leopard 
continues to improve on speech recognition by offering a host of tools that 
let you get more work done in a shorter amount of time. (We’re not to that 
point yet, Scotty, but we’re working on it.)
The Speech Recognition features of Mac OS X let you speak a word, phrase, 
or sentence. After you’ve spoken, your MacBook goes to work translating 
what you said — and if it understands the phrase, it then performs an action 
associated with that phrase. The great part about this system is that you 
can say any phrase in continuous speech and have your MacBook perform 
any sort of action that you can imagine. In fact, you aren’t limited to just 
one action: You can perform dozens of actions upon speaking a particular 
phrase.
Before you get started using Speech Recognition, you need a microphone to 
get sound into your MacBook. All current MacBook models have a built-in 
microphone.
 
If you’re looking for the best quality audio input for use with iChat or 
GarageBand, check out a microphone with a USB connection. You’ll get far 
better sound quality than a microphone that connects to your analog jack.
The Speech Recognition tab
To get started with Speech Recognition in Mac OS X, open the System 
Preferences window by clicking its icon in the Dock and then clicking the 
Speech icon. This brings up the Speech pane, as shown in Figure 3-1.
You’ll find that two tabs comprise the speech settings of Mac OS X:
 
✦ Speech Recognition
 
✦ Text to Speech
In this section, I’m concerned only with the Speech Recognition tab. Later, in 
the “Your Mac Talks Back!” section, I explore the Text to Speech tab.

728
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
 
Figure 3-1: 
Hail and

pane (and

The Speech Recognition pane contains two tabs:
 
✦ Settings: The Settings pane provides a number of settings that control 
how your MacBook listens to Its Master’s Voice. (Meaning you, friend 
reader.) From here, you can set the sound input, adjust the key on the 
keyboard that toggles speech recognition on and off, change microphone 
settings, and name your computer with a keyword. (You do want to call 
your computer by name as any techno-wizard does, don’t you?)
 
✦ Commands: When Speech Recognition is active, your MacBook can 
understand any number of commands. From the Commands tab, you tell 
the laptop what type of command it should expect you to give. You can 
also specify whether you’ll be giving the commands word for word or 
your MacBook should be prepared to interpret paraphrasing. A number 
of specific applications and menus can be configured with speakable 
items, such as contact names within Snow Leopard’s Address Book.
Crowning the Speech Recognition pane are the Speakable Items On and Off 
radio buttons. You’ve probably already guessed how to use ’em to switch 
Speech Recognition features on and off.
 
When you select the On radio button, the small circular Speech Recognition 
Feedback window appears on your screen, floating above all other windows. 
Know this face well because the Feedback window (also shown in Figure 3-1) 
is your friend and partner. If you use Speech Recognition often, it’ll become 
a constant companion on your Desktop. (More on it in the next section.)

Computer, Can You Hear Me?
The Settings pane
At the bottom of the Settings pane is the Upon Recognition section. When 
your MacBook comprehends one of your stentorian commands, you can set 
it to respond by playing a sound, speaking a confirmation, or both. This is 
helpful when you’re not sure whether your MacBook understands you. One 
hundred percent recognition isn’t a reality on any computer at this point, so 
sometimes it helps to have any feedback you can get. Otherwise, you might 
feel silly shouting at your machine while it sits there doing nothing. (Or 
perhaps not, if you’re into really inexpensive anger management.)
You can choose between two styles of listening with the Listening Method 
options:
 
✦ Listen Only While Key Is Pressed: Speech Recognition works only while 
the designated key is held down.
 
✦ Listen Continuously with Keyword: When you speak the keyword, 
listening turns on and remains on.
 
To change what key must be toggled or held down, click the Change Key 
button.
Why change the keyword? Instead of saying, “Computer, empty the Trash!” 
you might prefer, “Elrond, empty the Trash!” This adds a little bit of 
personality to the interaction and also gives your computer a slightly longer 
time to react to your command. (As a general rule, the longer the spoken 
phrase, the more likely your MacBook will understand it.) If you select the 
Listen Continuously with Keyword feature, you can change your computer’s 
name via the Keyword text box.
Finally, you can select the microphone that you want to use from the 
Microphone pop-up menu on the Settings pane — a great feature if you have 
more than one microphone connected to your MacBook. Click the Calibrate 
key to adjust the sound volume for better recognition.
The Commands pane
When Speech Recognition is active, your Mac listens for whatever phrases 
appear in your Speakable Items folder (a directory on your hard drive that 
holds a number of scripts). The Commands pane (shown in Figure 3-2) 
allows you to view the contents of this folder. When you speak a phrase 
that matches one of these filenames, your Mac automatically executes that 
script. The script can perform any number of actions, which is what makes 
Speech Recognition so powerful. Apple includes a large number of scripts 
with Mac OS X, but you’re free to create your own, too.

730
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
 
Figure 3-2: 
The 
Commands 
pane 
allows you 
to specify 
which 
commands 
your Mac 
should hear.
 
 
To make something speakable, select the item and then speak the command 
“Make this speakable.” The new speakable command is based upon the 
item’s name.
To view the contents of the Speakable Items folder, click the Open 
Speakable Items Folder button on the Commands pane. The Finder comes 
to the foreground and navigates to the folder that holds the scripts. This is 
handy because each item in the Speakable Items folder is speakable.
 
To the right of the Open Speakable Items Folder button is another button: 
Helpful Tips. Click it to get some pointers on how to get the best performance 
from your microphone.
As I mention in the preceding section, the Speech Recognition features 
of Mac OS X aren’t restricted to items in the Speakable Items folder. Any 
application that supports Speech Recognition is also fair game for your 
verbal manipulation. To control commands within other applications, use 
the Commands pane (refer to Figure 3-2). Here you can select the following 
check boxes:
 
✦ Address Book
 
✦ Global Speakable Items
 
✦ Application Specific Items
 
✦ Application Switching
 
✦ Front Window (requires that you activate assistive devices in the 
Universal Access pane within System Preferences)
 
✦ Menu Bar (requires that you activate assistive devices in the Universal 
Access pane within System Preferences)

Book IX
Chapter 3
Writing and

Your MacBook
731
Computer, Can You Hear Me?
Mark any one of these options to allow your MacBook to listen to those 
kinds of commands.
The Feedback window
After you activate Speech Recognition, you instantly see the Feedback 
window. You can click and drag the edge of the window to position it 
anywhere on your Desktop.
The Feedback window includes controls and displays of its own:
 
✦ Microphone Level Meter: The Feedback window displays indicators to 
let you know how loud the input to your microphone is.
 
✦ Visual Indicator: The Feedback window displays visual feedback to 
let you know what mode it is in: idle, listening, or hearing a command. 
When the microphone isn’t grayed out but there are no arrows on either 
side of the microphone, you’re in listening mode. When the microphone 
is flanked by animated arrows, your computer is hearing a command 
spoken. When Speech Recognition is idle, no arrows are present and the 
microphone is grayed out.
 
✦ Quick-Access Menu: You can quickly access the Speech preferences 
for the System or view the Speech Commands window. Just click the 
downward-pointing arrow at the bottom of the Feedback window, and a 
menu appears, giving you one-click access to both.
As soon as you disable speech recognition in the System Preferences, the 
Feedback window disappears.
The Speech Command window
Because Speech Recognition might be listening for different sets of commands 
from the Finder or many other applications, Mac OS X provides you with a 
single listing of all commands that you might speak at any given time: the 
Speech Commands window. To open the Speech Commands window, click 
the triangle at the bottom of the Feedback window and choose Open Speech 
Commands Window from the menu that appears.
The Speech Commands window is a simple one, but it serves an important 
purpose: to let you know what commands Mac OS X understands. The 
Speech Commands pane, as shown in Figure 3-3, organizes commands 
into categories that match the settings in the Speech pane of the System 
Preferences.
If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac 
OS X adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window. 
Speak any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For 
example, Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as 
Mail To and Video Chat With.

If you launch another application that supports Speech Recognition, Mac 
OS X adds that application’s commands to the Speech Commands window. 
Speak any of these commands to make your Mac execute that function. For 
example, Mac OS X ships with speech commands for Address Book, such as 
Mail To and Video Chat With.
 
Apple might be a big, serious, computer company — yeah, right — but it 
isn’t without a humorous side! With Speech Recognition enabled, say the 
phrase, “Tell me a joke.” Your MacBook replies with a random joke. Say it 
again, and your MacBook tells you another joke. (Brace yourself, these jokes 
were likely written by preschoolers . . . they’re really, really bad.) Oh, and 
if you get a “Knock, Knock” joke, remember that you have to actually say, 
“Who’s there?”
Your Mac Talks Back!
Mac OS X is great at listening to your speech, but the fun doesn’t stop 
there . . . your MacBook can talk to you, too! By using one of the many 
available voices — including the default Snow Leopard voice, Alex — you 
can make your computer talk or even sing. (Not as well as Sinatra, but better 
than Bob Dylan.) And although Speech Recognition lets you speak to your 
laptop, the VoiceOver feature gives your MacBook the ability to speak text. 
This is an especially useful feature because it lets you listen to your e-mails, 
Web pages, or even your homework — sometimes the eyes need a break. 
The text-to-speech capability gives you the opportunity to lean back in your 
chair or even get up and walk around while still using your computer.
Text-to-speech settings appear in three places within System Preferences: 
our old friend, the Speech pane; the Date & Time pane; and the VoiceOver 
settings within the Universal Access pane.

Your Mac Talks Back!
The Text to Speech panel
The text-to-speech engine that comes with Snow Leopard has a collection of 
many different voices from which to choose; some voices are male, some are 
female, and some aren’t human at all. To select your MacBook’s voice in 
Mac OS X, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the System Preferences icon in the Dock.
 
2. Click the Speech icon.
 
3. Click the Text to Speech tab, as shown in Figure 3-4.
 
Figure 3-4: 
You can 
select your 
Mac’s 
voice from 
the Text 
to Speech 
pane.
 
 
4. Click the System Voice pop-up menu to choose a voice for your 
MacBook.
 
 To hear the voice, click Play; Snow Leopard speaks a sentence as a 
demonstration. To the left of the Play button is a slider for adjusting the 
speed of the speech. Move the slider to the right to increase the speed 
at which your MacBook speaks and to the left to slow it down.
 
Naturally, Alex receives the most attention these days, because he’s the 
default voice for Snow Leopard . . . and Alex definitely provides the most 
natural-sounding tone and best pacing of the bunch. However, I also think 
that the old-school voices, like Bruce and Vicki, are still quite intelligible. 
(I’m a Vicki kinda guy myself.)
Talking alerts
After you select a voice, you have a variety of ways to make your laptop 
speak automatically to you, based on some simple rules. For example, 
every Mac owner has run into an Alert dialog. (Alert dialogs are typically 

734
Your Mac Talks Back!
accompanied by a select group of words — better left unspoken — from the 
human behind the keyboard.) An Alert dialog usually displays some kind of 
icon from the following list:
 
✦ Stop sign: Indicates that something particularly important requires your 
attention — usually an error or a dire warning.
 
✦ Yield sign: Signals that you should proceed cautiously; not as severe as 
the Stop sign, but important nonetheless.
 
✦ Notification: Looks like the profile of a person speaking; displays an 
informative message, but not a warning. You could use this feature, for 
example, to have a calendar application alert you when you have a 
meeting or a deadline.
From the Text to Speech pane, you can choose to have your MacBook speak 
a specific phrase or the contents of the Alert dialog by selecting one of the 
check boxes at the middle of the pane. If you select the Announce When 
Alerts Are Displayed check box, click the Set Alert Options button to set 
alert-specific options:
 
✦ Voice: Choose the voice that should speak alerts. (By default, it’s the 
voice you chose earlier.)
 
✦ Phrase: Click this pop-up menu to choose a “prefix” phrase that’s 
spoken before the actual alert text. By default, Snow Leopard speaks the 
name of the application that displayed the alert, but you can also choose 
a phrase from the list or choose to mix up the phrases for a little variety. 
To add or remove phrases, click the Edit Phrases item.
 
✦ Delay: Drag this slider to control the increment of time that Snow 
Leopard allows to pass before it speaks.
To hear what your spoken alert settings sound like in use, click the Play 
button.
 
If you click the Play button on the Set Alert Options sheet and don’t hear 
anything right away, remember that it doesn’t begin speaking until the time 
has elapsed that you set with the Delay slider. To hear the spoken alerts 
speak as soon as you click the Play button, move the slider to 0 (zero).
Other spoken items
In addition to spoken alerts, you can allow your Mac to speak when other 
actions occur. Again, these settings are found on the Text to Speech pane. 
Your MacBook can speak in the following circumstances:
 
✦ Announce when an application requires your attention: In case you 
have your Dock hidden from view, it’s not always clear when an 
application needs your attention. In these instances, Mac OS X grabs 
your attention via speech.

Book IX
Chapter 3
Writing and 
Conversing with 
Your MacBook
735
Your Mac Talks Back!
 
✦ Read a selection of text when you press a particular key: If you have a 
child who’s learning to read, the MacBook can help him or her by reading 
a selection of text. Kids can figure out how to drag and select text often 
more quickly than they can read that text.
 
✦ Announce the time: Are you like me, constantly getting lost in time 
while immersed in your work? (Not to mention your favorite game.) I’ve 
set my MacBook Pro to announce the hour, which always keeps my time 
sense firmly planted.
The Date & Time pane
There you are, deep in concentration as you finish up the final chapter of 
your Great American Novel, when you glance at the clock in the Finder menu 
bar and realize that you were supposed to pick up your kids at soccer practice 
a full hour ago!
You can avoid this shameful lapse of parental responsibility by turning on 
Snow Leopard’s automatic spoken time feature, which is controlled from the 
Date & Time pane within System Preferences (and is much more effective 
than a mechanical cuckoo clock). But why go to all the trouble of clicking 
Show All when you can just click the Open Date & Time Preferences button 
on the Text to Speech pane? Snow Leopard immediately switches to display 
the Date & Time pane. You can even click the Clock on the Finder menu bar 
and click Open Date & Time. (Again, it’s all about the convenience when it 
comes to the geniuses at Apple.)
From the Date & Time pane, click the Clock tab and select the Announce 
the Time check box to enable your MacBook to speak the time; then use the 
Period pop-up menu to choose spoken time at the quarter, half, or full hour. 
You can also customize the voice for spoken time as well.
After you’re done, zip back to the Speech pane by clicking the Back button at 
the top-left corner of the System Preferences window.
Configuring VoiceOver within 
the Universal Access pane
With Snow Leopard’s VoiceOver utility, your MacBook can provide you with 
all sorts of verbal feedback, creating a spoken English interface with Snow 
Leopard — a valuable addition to the operating system for the physically 
impaired. The feedback includes
 
✦ Announcing when certain keys are pressed: Snow Leopard can tell you 
when a modifier key (such as Control, Option, or Ô) is pressed or when 
the Caps Lock key is pressed.
 
✦ Announcing cursor movements: You hear an audible alert when your 
mouse cursor switches between windows or when you’ve clicked a menu.

736
Your Mac Talks Back!
 
✦ Announcing the position of the VoiceOver cursor: VoiceOver can 
audibly identify all operating system controls (such as buttons, sliders, 
and list boxes) by using a special on-screen cursor.
 
✦ Reading documents, Web pages, and Mail messages: VoiceOver can 
read aloud the contents of all sorts of documents and application 
windows.
 
✦ Speaking the characters you type: You can set VoiceOver to speak 
every character or each word you type.
Here is how to enable VoiceOver (or to launch the VoiceOver utility, as 
shown in Figure 3-5):
 
Figure 3-5: 
You can 
customize 
the 
VoiceOver 
audible 
feedback 
with the 
VoiceOver 
Utility.
 
 
1. Click the Open Universal Access Preferences button on the Text to 
Speech pane.
 
2. Select the On radio button (or press Ô+F5) to enable VoiceOver. (If 
you’re using a current MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, or a 
newer Mac desktop keyboard, press Ô+Fn+F5 instead.)
 
 To customize how VoiceOver operates, click the Open VoiceOver Utility 
button.
Speaking text through applications
Although VoiceOver provides a comprehensive text-to-speech interface 
for Mac OS X, it might be more than you need. If you simply want to hear 
text spoken within your applications, a number of alternative methods are 
included in Snow Leopard that don’t require VoiceOver.
One of the simplest ways to hear spoken text in Mac OS X is by using the 
TextEdit application. TextEdit is a simple text processor that accompanies 
every copy of Mac OS X. Besides its handy word processing features, 

Book IX
Chapter 3
Writing and 
Conversing with 
Your MacBook
737
Your Mac Talks Back!
TextEdit can also speak text. This is good for reviewing a document after 
you’ve written it by listening to it. To hear spoken text with TextEdit, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Launch TextEdit from the Applications folder.
 
 To open the Applications folder, choose Go➪Applications from the 
Finder. In the window that appears, double-click the TextEdit application.
 
 This launches the TextEdit application and opens a new document.
 
2. Enter some text.
 
 Either type some text on the keyboard or paste some into the document 
from the Clipboard. Here’s an example:
Billy Gates has lots of cash
Lots of cash
Lots of cash
Billy Gates has lots of cash
I’d like $10 please!
 
3. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Start Speaking.
 
 Your MacBook begins speaking the text from the document. The speech 
engine has some intelligence, so you can enter dollar amounts (such as 
$25,423.12) or Roman numerals (such as Chapter XIV), and the speech 
engine reads them back in plain English. The result of these two strings 
would be “twenty-five thousand, four-hundred twenty-three dollars, and 
twelve cents” and “chapter fourteen.”
 
4. Choose Edit➪Speech➪Stop Speaking.
 
 Your MacBook stops speaking. It also stops speaking when it reaches 
the end of the text.
Speaking text through services
You can also speak text within most applications by using the Services 
menu, located under the application’s named menu. To speak text from an 
application, first select that text. Then, choose Application➪Services➪
Speech➪Start Speaking to speak text from many applications (where 
Application is the name of the currently running application). If you don’t 
want to use VoiceOver, this works great for doing things like
 
✦ Speaking a Web page aloud
 
✦ Reading your e-mail
 
✦ Listening to a speech you’ve written in Pages
As you might expect, choosing Application➪Services➪Speech➪Stop 
Speaking ceases the banter emanating from your MacBook’s speaker.

738
Your Mac Talks Back!
 
Alas, not all applications are created equal. Some applications can’t access 
the Services offered in the Services menu. If you don’t see Speech in the list 
of services, you’re out of luck.
