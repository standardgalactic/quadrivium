The underlined headings correspond to the two Somatic Nervous system videos. 
 
1. Introduction and structure 
 
The efferent portion of the peripheral nervous system consists of the somatic 
nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system 
controls the function of glands, smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and the neurons of the 
GI tract. It is composed of two neurons in series that can either excite or inhibit the 
target organ. In contrast, the somatic nervous system contains single neurons that 
excite skeletal muscles. The movements controlled by the somatic nervous system can 
be voluntary or involuntary (reflexes).  
 
Motor Unit 
 
The axons of motor neurons are myelinated and have large diameters for fast 
conduction of action potentials. As the axon approaches a skeletal muscle fiber (muscle 
cell) it usually branches to form synapses with anywhere from three to one thousand 
muscle fibers. However, each muscle fiber is usually innervated by only a single neuron. 
A motor unit consists of a neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates. A single 
neuron innervates fibers from only one muscle and the innervated muscle fibers are 
usually spread throughout the muscle. 
 
The portion of the skeletal muscle 
fiber plasma membrane that synapses 
with the motor neuron axon is called the 
motor end plate. Once an action potential 
arrives at the axon terminal, the 
depolarization of the membrane opens 
voltage-gated calcium channels (Fig. 1). 
An increase in intracellular calcium at the 
terminal causes release of acetylcholine 
vesicles into the neuromuscular 
junction. The acetylcholine binds nicotinic 
channels at the motor end plate which 
causes them to open and allow sodium to 
enter (Fig.1). The sodium entry triggers 
voltage-gated sodium channels near the 
motor end plate, initiating an action 
potential which is propagated in all 
directions along the plasma membrane of 
the muscle fiber.

Spinal Cord 
Anatomy 
The cell bodies of 
the neurons that 
innervate skeletal muscle 
of the body are found in 
the ventral horn of the 
spinal cord (Fig. 2, blue). 
The neurons that 
innervate the skeletal 
muscle of the head are in 
the brainstem. In the 
body, sensory signals 
come into the spinal cord 
from the dorsal root 
ganglia, which contain 
the cell bodies of sensory 
neurons (Fig. 2, red). 
These neurons can 
excite motor neurons in the spinal cord. Motor neuron axons travel through tissues as 
nerves and synapse on skeletal muscle cells. Excitation of motor neurons causes 
acetylcholine to be released at the neuromuscular 
junction causing contraction of the muscle. The muscle 
relaxes when the motor neuron is no longer excited. 
 
2. Control of Movement 
The spinal cord is not just a conduit connecting 
the peripheral nervous system and the brain. Instead, 
movements such as walking as well as reflexes are 
organized by the spinal cord. In situations when control 
by upper motor neurons in the brain is necessary, 
they act on the lower motor neurons of the spinal cord 
to influence reflexes and voluntary movements.  
Two types of lower motor neurons. The 
portion of a skeletal muscle that controls posture and 
movement, the extrafusal muscle fibers, are innervated 
by alpha motor neurons. A specialized type of skeletal 
muscle fiber, the intrafusal muscle cell, resides in the 
muscle spindle in the interior of the muscle (Fig. 3). 
The intrafusal muscle fibers are innervated by gamma 
motor neurons. During muscle contraction, alpha and 
gamma motor neurons are coactivated. Stretching of 
the intrafusal fibers in the muscle spindle is sensed by 
stretch receptors and sent via afferent sensory neurons

to the spinal cord. This allows for 
monitoring of the length of the 
muscle which helps control 
muscle tone. 
 
Two types of muscle 
sensory receptors.  In order for 
the body to be able to control 
muscle contraction properly, there 
must be feedback about the 
contractile status of individual 
muscles. The muscle spindle is an 
important muscle sensory receptor 
that provides information about 
muscle length and the rate of 
change of muscle length. In 
addition, Golgi tendon organs 
are encapsulated sensory 
receptors situated in tendons near 
the junction with the muscle (Fig. 
3). They detect changes in muscle 
tension instead of changes in muscle 
length. Both types of sensory receptors 
send information to the spinal cord and the 
brain that is usually subconscious. 
 
Muscle Stretch Reflex. If a muscle 
spindle within a muscle is quickly 
stretched, the muscle stretch reflex causes 
contraction of the muscle as well as nearby 
muscles. This is what occurs when the 
patellar tendon is struck during a physical 
exam (Fig. 4). The afferent sensory neuron 
relays the stretch signal from the muscle 
spindle to its cell body in the dorsal root of 
the spinal cord. The sensory neuron 
synapses with the motor neuron in the 
spinal cord that controls that muscle. In 
addition, the sensory neuron activates an 
inhibitory neuron which inhibits the motor 
neuron (reducing its likelihood of firing an 
action potential) leading to the muscle on 
the opposite side of the limb, causing it to 
relax (Fig. 4). The muscle spindle reflex is 
important in allowing maintenance of the 
length of a certain muscle.

Golgi Tendon Reflex. If the Golgi tendon organs of a muscle are stretched and 
stimulated, muscle contraction is inhibited through inhibition of the motor neuron leading 
to that muscle. This is because the afferent neuron activates an inhibitory neuron which 
is synapsing with the motor neuron (Fig. 5). In addition, the opposing muscle is 
stimulated to contract through the interaction of an excitatory interneuron with the 
afferent neuron (Fig. 5). The Golgi tendon reflex acts to protect muscles and tendons 
from damage due to excessive tension. In addition, they may play a role in equalizing 
the load across different parts of a muscle. 
 
Withdrawal Reflexes. A withdrawal reflex occurs when a part of the body such 
as a portion of a limb is subjected to a painful stimulus. The flexor reflex causes 
contraction of one muscle and relaxation of the opposing muscle to move that portion of 
the body away from the insult. A short time after the flexor reflex initiates, the crossed 
extensor reflex initiates on the opposite side of the body. This reflex allows for the 
opposite side of the body to support the body’s weight or to push the body out of the 
way of the painful stimulus. 
 
Locomotion. Walking and running require the legs to alternate between forward 
flexion (the swing phase) and backward extension (the stance phase). The repetition 
of this pattern is synchronized with the other leg so that the two legs remain in opposite 
phases. In most animals, if the spinal cord is separated from the brain the four legs can 
still make coordinated walking motions. This is accomplished through central pattern 
generators which are oscillatory neural circuits of lower motor neurons in the spinal 
cord.  Even though these circuits control the basic movements of walking, they are 
greatly influenced by the brain. For instance, running occurs when the brain causes the 
central pattern generators to shorten the stance phase. In addition, posture and goal-
directed locomotion require input from the brain. However, the central pattern 
generators allow relatively simple modifications by the brain to control a very 
complicated process such as locomotion.
