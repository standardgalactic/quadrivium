Preface
The spread of mobile telephone service has changed the telephone age from 
for the family to for a private use. In addition, the mobile terminals are not 
used as a telephone but as the Smart Phone and all the electrical products in 
near future. The use of electromagnetic wave is mandatory for the mobile com­
munication systems because we do not like to be tied by a wire for the com­
munication. An important component for the radio communication system is 
an antenna for both radiation and reception of the electromagnetic wave. The 
antenna determines the sensitivity of the receiver and the radiation efficiency 
of the transmitter. Its performance cannot be calculated numerically; anten­
nas include the surroundings and free space radiation condition. The recent 
remarkable progress in the computing of resources may help the design stage 
of the antennas. However, it is necessary for the antenna development that the 
antenna characteristics are confirmed by the measurement. In addition to the 
computer-aided design, a cut and try technique is widely used in the design of 
base station antennas and the infrastructure of mobile communication systems. 
Expert engineers often utilize the cut and try technique to complete the an­
tenna development in the shortest period; this procedure requires the antenna 
measurement.
The purpose of this book is to present the measurement method from the 
antenna side for a mobile communication system. Prior to the antenna mea­
surement method, the propagation characteristics of radio waves in the service 
area should be measured in the design of the mobile communication system. 
A great deal of data of propagation characteristics is obtained by the measure­
ment. However, the propagation measurements are also important in confirm­
ing the designed performance in actual environment. The conventional voice 
communication requires a narrow frequency bandwidth for its data transmis-

12

sion; however, high-speed data transmission for the seamless connection with 
present cable network requires wide frequency bandwidth. 
The first edition of this book was published in 2000. Recently, mobile 
phones that were originally introduced for the purpose of talking with another 
person wirelessly have been used to view and store data (i.e., Smart Phones). 
Major changes in mobile antenna measurements have appeared in radiation 
efficiency measurement, mobile phone usage position, and multiple-input and 
multiple-output (MIMO) antennas. These cutting edge techniques and other 
revised materials are included in this edition.
Chapter 1 presents the definitions of basic terminology for both narrow­
band and wideband propagation measurements, and also presents typical mea­
surement systems and the parameters of measurement.
The most popular item of the mobile communication terminal is a por­
table or mobile phone. Chapter 2 deals with the necessary measurement proce­
dures for the mobile phone and mobile terminal antennas. Following the defini­
tions of measurement parameters, the practical measurement procedures carried 
out in indoor facilities are described. In addition to these measurements, an 
electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) or electromagnetic emission (EMI) test is 
a mandatory requirement before releasing the antenna as a commercial product. 
A typical measurement method used for this purpose is also presented. Chapter 
2 also describes the mobile terminal antenna tests used for product evaluation. 
When a handset terminal is being used or is in the “use position,”  the 
antenna characteristics are seriously changed by the terminal’s position due to 
the hand and head of carrier. A stable measurement facility imitating human 
body is necessary for the design of the handset antenna to include the effect of 
hand and head. For this purpose, a special type of mannequin called a phantom 
is used in the measurement. Chapter 3 presents the different kinds of phan­
toms and the techniques that are used to evaluate the influence of the human 
body on the antenna characteristics. Measurement examples are shown using 
the phantom in place of an actual human operator, and data comparing mea­
surements using the phantom and an operator is presented. In addition to the 
measurement of antenna characteristics, Chapter 3 presents the examples of the 
regulation standard of specific absorption ratio (SAR) as a safety standard for 
the electromagnetic wave irradiation to human body. The detail definition of 
SAR and how to measure it using a phantom are also presented together.
In building up the mobile communication network, a base station is the 
most important infrastructure. The cellular system requires a high-performance 
base station antenna to increase the capacity of subscribers. Chapter 4 presents 
the propagation estimation method for the base station siting for the cellular 
system, the method of the base station antenna design, and the measurement 
method for base station antenna. The high-power input to the base station an­
tenna is frequently met with the problem of passive intermodulation (PIM). In 

 
Preface 
13
Chapter 4, the theory of PIM and the measurement system are described. The 
product is tested prior to shipping; these tests include electrical, mechanical, and 
reliability performance, which are described in detail with practical examples. 
In the development stage of the mobile terminals, the specifications in­
clude the test under multipath fading environment. This test can be easily con­
firmed by the propagation measurement in a real outdoor environment. How­
ever, the outdoor propagation measurement is not always stable in time and is 
required to get the license by the regulation. There are two methods used to 
reproduce fading phenomenon for the mobile terminal measurement. One is 
a fading simulator to generate fading waves as an output of RF signal, and the 
other is the reproduction of artificial fading waves as a summation of spatially 
distributed standing waves, called as a field simulator. The MIMO system is used 
for the latest mobile phones and WiFi terminals to increase data transmission 
speed. The MIMO system needs more than two antennas in a device, which re­
quires another evaluation method for mobile antennas. Chapter 5 describes the 
principle and the constitution of fading simulator, field simulator  and MIMO 
antenna theory and cutting edge measurement methods.
This book is devoted to the theory and technique for the antenna measure­
ments used in mobile communication systems and includes detailed examples 
for important topics. This book can not only be used only for the development 
stage of the antenna, but also for the maintenance of base station antennas. The 
author hopes this book will be of help to the design and development of mobile 
communication systems.

Propagation Measurements
This chapter discusses common evaluation procedures for propagation mea­
surements of mobile terminals and the base stations. Propagation measure­
ments of mobile terminals involve tests in a real environment while testing base 
stations at the observation site generates field profiles. The former are carried 
out as final tests on newly developed mobile phones, following checks in an 
indoor measurement environment. The latter tests the performance of a newly 
built base station antenna for basic propagation characteristics during the con­
struction of new mobile communication systems. Although the purpose of the 
two measurements is different, identical procedures are used.
1.1  Overview of Propagation Measurement
Propagation measurements can be divided into narrowband and wideband. 
Narrowband measurements use the envelope of a continuous electromag­
netic signal with no modulation. From the recorded level of the electric field 
strength, the propagation loss curves for macroscopic observations of the site 
may be evaluated; the fading characteristics for microscopic observations are 
also simultaneously evaluated.
The propagation loss or attenuation between the transmission and recep­
tion sites depends on the characteristics of the environment. For the design of 
a wireless system, the transmission power and antenna gain must take into ac­
count of this attenuation. If the system has a transmission power of Pt, a trans­
mission antenna gain Gt, and a reception antenna gain Gt, then the received 
power Pr can be obtained by including the propagation loss L as:

(1.2)
and is called the free space propagation loss factor. Equation (1.1) is known as 
the Friis’s transmission equation. In real environments, very often several propa­
gation paths exist aside from the direct one. Interference between the signals 
along the various paths causes severe field variations and multipath fading. The 
measured data includes this fading and often proves to be significantly larger 
than the free-space propagation loss. A propagation loss measurement of the 
site includes both of these factors.
Propagation loss is measured within a range from a few hundred meters 
to tens of thousand of kilometers. However, the received signal level frequently 
drops due to the sum of several signals with different phases. In order for a 
wireless communication system to overcome this fading phenomenon, higher 
power margins are required to guarantee the system quality. Commonly, in 
terrestrial mobile communication systems, a fading margin of more than 20 
dB is used. Knowledge of the fading characteristics of a site allows a suitable 
fading margin to be selected for the system design. The first part of this chapter 
describes narrowband propagation measurements.
Another important class of propagation measurement is the so-called 
wideband measurement. Recent mobile communication systems use ever in­
creasing higher-speed data transmission rates. The delay profile of the site limits 
the maximum data transmission rate of the system. When the delay profile 
is known in advance, a circuit called an equalizer can be used to cancel the 
unwanted signal delay. In addition, a rake receiver can be used to add several 
delayed signals with the direct propagation path signal to increase the effective 
received signal level. Thus, this requires a delay profile measurement to be per­
formed for wideband communication systems.
Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of this chapter also includes definitions of basic ter­
minology for narrowband propagation measurements, such as propagation loss, 
cross polarization, and diversity. Section 1.4 describes wideband measurements. 
Lastly, Section 1.5 presents typical measurement systems for both narrowband 
and wideband propagation measurements, and also describes the parameters 
measured.

 
Propagation Measurements 
17
1.2  Field Profile Measurement
Measurement parameters of interest in a narrowband system are the propaga­
tion loss and the fading characteristics. In order to find the electric field strength 
over an area of more than a few kilometers from the base station, a propagation 
loss measurement is made. On the other hand, if the area of measurement has 
a radius from only a few meters to a few 10s of meters centered on the base 
station, then only the fading characteristics are determined. For the latter mea­
surement, the average received electric field strength can be regarded as almost 
constant.
Outdoor propagation environments are roughly classified into suburban 
areas and city areas from the viewpoint of the fading characteristics. Normally, 
there are few tall buildings in a suburban environment, and the propagation 
path consists of a strong direct path signal from the base station plus an array of 
scattered waves at the observation point. In this case, the fading characteristics 
are categorized as Rician fading. In a city environment, however, the scatter­
ing and reflections of the signal from the base station from multiple locations 
eliminates the direct signal. For this situation, almost the same level of mul­
tipath signals from many directions are received at the receiving point. The 
fading characteristics in this situation are classified as Rayleigh fading, and this 
is discussed in more detail in Section 1.2.3. In order to test mobile communica­
tions equipment, a typical propagation environment should be chosen for the 
measurement site. To find a typical measurement environment, it is necessary 
to select the propagation site before field testing.
1.2.1  Site Selection
The environment characteristics close to the observation point can seriously 
affect the measurements. Sites discussed here are classified in terms of fading 
characteristics, field strength, and cross-polarization ratio. The simplest way to 
classify a measurement site is to determine whether or not the transmitting 
station is directly observable from the observation point. If the transmitting 
station can be directly observed, it is called a line-of-sight (LOS) measurement 
site; if the transmitting station cannot be directly observed, it is called a non-
line-of-sight (NLOS) site. This method of categorization is based on the geo­
metrical theory of optics. The dominant fading characteristics for LOS and 
NLOS sites are called the Rician and Rayleigh distributions, respectively. Fad­
ing characteristics will be discussed in detail in Section 1.2.3, however, it can be 
stated in general that Rayleigh fading can be observed inside a city while Rician 
fading tends to be found in the suburbs [1–3].
When the measurement site is categorized in terms of the field strength, 
there are three types of site classification. The average field strength level defined 

18 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
later is roughly divided into strong, medium, and weak regimes. The electric 
field strength discussed here is at the reception antenna output. The electric 
field strength level classification greatly depends on the operating frequency and 
system design. The strong field region has as a mean field strength level of more 
than 40 dBµV. The medium field range is then 20 to 40 dBµV, and the weak 
field range is less than 20 dBµV for current mobile communication systems op­
erating in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF) band (300 MHz–3 GHz). The base 
noise level is classified as being around 0 dBµV.
1.2.2  Attenuation Coefficient Measurement
When the electric field is measured against the range, r, from the transmitting 
antenna, it is found that the amplitude decreases as 1/r for the condition where 
there are no reflected or diffracted waves present. For practical measurement of 
the electric field, where the relative power of the field is measured in units of 
dB, the measured data decreases as 1/r2. Figure 1.1 shows an example of the 
measured electric field in the UHF band within a range from a few meters to 
a few kilometers. The measured electric field does not follow a 1/r2 decay law 
but in general a 1/rn (n > 2) decay law. This approximation is quite rough, and 
the measured data can be quite scattered. This macroscopic data treatment is 
commonly used for the design of a base station coverage area. The attenuation 
coefficient is a basic evaluation factor for propagation characteristic measure­
ment. The received signal levels expressed in dBµV are plotted as a function

of distance from the transmitting station. The measured data are varied over a 
wide range so the propagation decay profile is found approximately.
Another propagation measurement can be carried out near the transmit­
ting base station for the purpose of indoor propagation measurements or micro/
pico cellular system design. Figure 1.2 plots the results of an example of a short-
range measurement of the received electric field in the vicinity of the transmit­
ting station. As shown in Figure 1.2, severe fading can be observed. To find the 
average signal level at the measurement site, a short-term median is used. The 
definition of the short term varies, depending on the measurement rage. When 
the total measurement length is a few hundred meters, the median value of the 
collected data in a few meters is used as the short term median. However, for 
measurements of more than tens of kilometers, the short term is defined as a 
few kilometers. The short term is classed as being roughly 1/100 of the total 
measurement length. 
A communications receiver converts the free-space radio frequency (RF) 
signal to intermediate frequencies (IF) using an envelope detector. When seek­
ing the average received signal level from the measured data (normally recorded 
in units of dB), it is important to take into consideration the characteristics 
of the detector. The measured data must first be transformed into linear units 
before the mean value of the data is sought. A square law detector is used to 
pick up the electric field, but has input-output characteristics that do not always 
exactly follow the square curve law. If calibration of the detector is carried out 
for every measurement, the measurement process can be time-consuming and

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
cumbersome.  In order to exclude such a procedure, a median is used as an 
average value. The median for received data consisting of a total number of N 
data points may be estimated using the following procedure. The data is sorted 
by amplitude with the (N/2)th amplitude chosen as the median. The median 
value eliminates the deep fading in the measurement and gives an average value 
for the measurement site. In addition, the cell edge is defined by the level of 
the median of the down link (transmitter to receiver) at the mobile terminal in 
practical cellular systems. The critical value is set at between 10 and 20 dBµV, 
depending on the system design.
1.2.3  Fading Structure
Electromagnetic waves radiated from a transmitting station reach the observa­
tion point through multiple reflections and diffractions; these cause multipath 
fading. The fading structure is modeled here from a statistical point of view. 
The signals arriving at the observation point are concentrated in a horizontal 
plane when the transmitting station is located far from the point of observa­
tion. Figure 1.3 shows the case where the observation point is moving along the 
x-axis with a velocity of v meters per second (m/s). For this situation, N waves 
arrive from the φi direction, each with an amplitude Ai and phase ζi. The time-
varying electric field Er(t) at the observation point is expressed in terms of the 
angular frequency, ωc as:

When the amplitudes of the individual waves, Ai, are almost the same and 
the phase ζi changes randomly, the coefficients of cos ωct and sin ωct are given

1.2.4  Cumulative Probability
Section 1.2.3 defined the fading structure of a mobile propagation environ­
ment using the probability density function. From a practical point of view, 
it is useful to express the received field strength as a probability function. The 
probability is useful to judge whether the received signal strength is less than 
a critical level or not. The probability density function, p(R), of the Rayleigh 
distribution can be rewritten as follows by using the mean value of the square 
amplitude v = 2σ2:

In mobile propagation measurements, the median of the square of the

where ν/2 is the total received power of the weak diffracted waves, and γ is the 
ratio between the power level of the strong direct wave and ν/2. The Rician 
distribution is also shown in Figure 1.4, where its fading depth is decreased by 
a factor γ.
1.2.5  Cross Polarization
The electromagnetic wave radiated from the base station propagates in free 
space and consists of electric and magnetic field components that are orthogo­
nal to each other. The propagation characteristics are mainly described by the 
electric field component. The polarization describes the direction of the electric 
field component.
In the early days, mobile communication systems used vertical polariza­
tion in the VHF (30 MHz–300 MHz) band because the horizontal polarization 
component becomes very weak at a height of 1 to 2m above the mobile station 
ground level. Although recent terrestrial mobile communication systems in the 
UHF band (300 MHz–3 GHz) transmit vertically polarized waves from the 
base station, many obstacles in the propagation path reflect or diffract the trans­
mitted waves and excite a proportion of the horizontally polarized component. 
It is therefore important to measure the cross-polarization ratio (XPR) at a mo­
bile terminal in advance of the propagation measurement. The XPR is defined

where Pv and Ph are the short-range medians for the vertically and horizontally 
polarized components, respectively, at the measured site. In the ideal case, the 
radiation pattern of the measuring antenna should be identical in both planes 
of measurement (vertical and horizontal). However, in real XPR measurements, 
it is often convenient to use a standard half-wave dipole antenna as the measur­
ing antenna. Figure 1.5 shows typical XPR measurement results around a tall 
building in the city and in the corridor between offices on the seventh floor of 
the building.  The XPR is high in the line-of-sight region and is degraded in the 
shadow of the building. The XPR was found to be around 9 dB in a suburban 
area and from 3 to 6 dB in the city. The XPR decreased to 0 dB at sites sur­
rounded by tall buildings [4].
1.2.6  Delay Profile and Delay Spread
In wireless high-speed digital transmission, the desired symbol data can be cor­
rupted by interference effects caused by the interaction of the directly transmit­
ted signal with a reflected path signal. When the data speed is increased, the 
previously transmitted symbol data can arrive at the receiving point simultane­
ously with currently transmitted symbol data. The use of diversity reception, 
adaptive antenna pattern shaping, or implementation of a signal processing 
system may eliminate these undesired signals. To select an appropriate method 
for designing a communication system, the characteristics of the delayed signal 
must be measured in advance at several sites. 
For the delayed signal measurement, the base station transmits a pulse 
signal and the mobile terminal receives the echo. Figure 1.6(a) shows an ex­
ample of an actual delayed signal profile received at a fixed observation point; 
the actual received signal shown in Figure 1.6(a) is modeled by an ideal received 
signal shown in Figure 1.6(b). The distribution function of the received signal 
strength, as a function of time t, is denoted by the function f(t). Thus, the re­
ceived power Pm, (which includes the delayed pulse) is given by:

can be calculated using the direct line-of-sight distance from the transmitter to 
the receiver. However, a definition also including the noise level L0 is useful for 
practical evaluation purposes. A second evaluation factor TD is defined as the 
mean of the delay time as:

1.3  Diversity Measurement
Multipath fading at the mobile receiver varies with the sum of the electric field 
components incident on the receiving antenna from various directions and can

delay profile.

 
Propagation Measurements 
27
range from about 20 dB to 40 dB. One technique to help reduce the influence 
of deep fading is diversity reception.  This technique uses several simultaneously 
received independent signals and synthesizes these signals to compensate for 
the fading. The diversity scheme often employs multiple-input multiple-output 
(MIMO) antennas, rather than just input antennas. In Section 1.4.1.2, diver­
sity schemes are discussed, as well as suitable measurement techniques.
1.3.1  Diversity Scheme
Diversity reception is used for mobile terminals and base stations to help com­
pensate for very weak signal reception caused by multipath fading. The same 
increase in communication performance is also expected for the base station.
However, it serves an additional purpose. The down-link signal from the base 
station to the mobile terminal is stronger than the up-link from the mobile 
terminal to the base station. The base station transmits tens of watts, while the 
mobile terminal radiated power can be less than 1W in current cellular systems. 
The main purpose of using diversity reception at the base station is therefore 
to compensate for the difference in signal levels between the uplink and the 
downlink.
Diversity schemes may be categorized into three major types: antenna 
(or space), frequency, and time, as shown in Figure 1.7 [5]. The latter two 
methods depend on the type of communication system, while the antenna di­
versity method is independent of the system. The focus of this section is on the 
Figure 1.7  Various diversity reception schemes (a) space diversity, (b) polarization diversity,

antenna diversity. Antenna diversity techniques use several methods to help 
reduce fading. One method is to use several independent signals from different 
antennas spaced apart. Another method is termed polarization diversity, and 
takes advantage of the normal and cross-polarization components of the re­
ceived signal. Yet another technique called antenna pattern diversity (also called 
angular diversity) utilizes the signals from antennas with nonoverlapping an­
tenna radiation patterns. Antenna pattern diversity has been used for overseas 
wireless communications in the high frequency (HF) band (3 MHz–30 MHz) 
to eliminate the fading caused by time variations from signals reflected from 
the ionosphere.
Space diversity systems are widely used at the cellular base station antenna. 
However, the antenna gain of the base station is approximately 10 dBi or more, 
and this requires antennas to be spaced by more than 10 to 20 wavelengths 
apart in order to decrease the mutual interference between the two antennas. 
Recently, the drastic increase in the number of subscribers has forced wire­
less service providers to install an even larger number of base station antennas. 
Polarization diversity schemes using an inclined polarization scheme of ±45 
degrees have been adopted in Europe and America to obtain a stable mobile 
uplink communications. In Japan, a polarization scheme utilizing the horizon­
tal and vertical polarization components has been used because the handheld 
mobile phone terminal is often used at a tilted angle [6].
In addition to diversity antennas, the so-called sector antenna, a type of 
directional antenna with a sector-shaped radiation pattern in a horizontal plane, 
is widely used for base stations. This antenna divides the coverage area into 
three or more sectors. In high-speed digital data transmission, the sector an­
tenna helps to eliminate the delayed signal due to multiple reflections, and may 
be used for applications like wireless LANs or mobile communication systems.
1.3.2  Correlation Histogram and Coefficient
The performance of diversity antennas is evaluated by measuring the amplitude 
and phase components of the radiation pattern, or by testing the antenna in a 
practical environment. These radiation patterns will hereafter be referred to as 
complex radiation patterns. In both cases, the evaluation factor is the correlation 
coefficient between different diversity branches of the antenna. Generally, the 
term diversity branch denotes the multiple-output from the antenna after the 
modulated signal is detected. However, in this section, it refers to the different 
antenna output ports. When there are two output branches for a particular 
diversity antenna, the correlation coefficient of the detected signal envelope of 
and  is defined as:

where <x> denotes the mean value of the measured parameter x, and (y)* de­
notes the complex conjugate of the difference of the measured parameter (y). In 
propagation measurements, the correlation coefficient is calculated every 100 
or 200 samples, and a correlation histogram of the form shown in Figure 1.8 
is built up. In practical diversity measurements, more than tens of thousands 
of data samples are collected in one measurement. Thus, for a single measure­
ment, hundreds of correlation coefficients must be calculated. Due to the large 
number of data samples required to be collected, it is best if the correlation coef­
ficient is calculated in the region where the average received electric field level 
is almost constant, thus reducing the total number of calculations. The correla­
tion coefficient is used for the macroscopic evaluation of diversity antennas.
1.3.3  Diversity Gain
The effectiveness of diversity reception is evaluated by the correlation coeffi­
cient presented in Section 1.3.2. Another evaluation factor is the diversity gain. 
Using diversity reception in a multipath propagation environment reduces the 
fading depth of the received signal. In a propagation environment exhibiting 
Rayleigh distribution fading, the probability P of the received signal-to-noise

where selection diversity is assumed after detection of the received signals and 
the correlation coefficient between branches is zero. In selection diversity, se­
lecting the branch with highest power combines the data sequences represent­
ing the envelope power received by each branch. Figure 1.9 shows an example 
of the cumulative probability distribution. In this figure, the diversity gain is 
defined by the difference of the reception level at P(γ) = 1% between the curve 
n = 1 and N.
1.4  Definition of the Diversity Gain
Diversity gain indicates the degree by which diversity reception reduces the 
fading depth. In order to evaluate the selection process statistically from the 
measured propagation data, the envelope of the received signal for each di­
versity branch is combined by selecting the branch with the highest level of

1.5  Propagation Measurement System
This section describes the propagation measurement system used to evaluate 
the propagation loss factor at a site, and also the diversity performance of the 
system. For the evaluation of both factors the measurement system is essentially 
the same except for the multiple receiving antennas required for the diversity 
measurement. The system performance is, however, heavily dependent upon 
the linearity and response time of the detector and these topics will also be dealt 
with later in this section. In the final parts of this section, a low-cost multichan­
nel measuring technique that utilizes antenna switching will be presented.
1.5.1  Measurement Systems
Measurement systems may be classified into four types. The most basic system 
measures the propagation loss factor for both short and long ranges to find the 
site attenuation coefficient. A second type of measurement system is used to 
investigate the fading structure and diversity performance of the antenna used 
in narrowband mobile communication systems. A third type of measurement 
system finds the delay spread to evaluate of the wide band characteristics of the 
system. Lastly, for maintenance and field checking of cellular systems currently 
in service, fully automated field measurement systems are required. This section 
describes appropriate measurement systems for each purpose.
1.5.1.1  Long Range and Short Range Propagation Loss Measurement
Figure 1.10 illustrates a standard measurement system. This system consists of a 
signal generator connected to a low-gain antenna and a receiver with a standard 
antenna. In this case, the standard antenna is a half wavelength dipole antenna 
with a known radiation pattern and antenna gain. The level of the envelope 
signal at the receiver output after detection is sampled using an analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC). For long range measurements, the sampling rate of the ADC 
is chosen to sample the data at less than a quarter wavelength spacing. This is 
because the period of the standing wave created between the transmitting and re­
ceiving antenna has a period of one half wavelength, as is shown in Figure 1.11.
Thus, the sampling frequency fs is determined by the relation fs = 4υ/λ 
Hz, where the receiving system is moving at a rate of v m/s, and λ is the operat­
ing wavelength of the signal generator. In order to record the fading structure in 
detail without using any interpolation techniques, the sampling spacing should 
be less than λ/20 for short range measurements [7]. Finely spaced sampling 

32 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
is required to obtain fading depth below -30 dB in the measured Rayleigh 
distribution data.
1.5.1.2  Diversity Performance Measurement
The only difference between the measurement system used in Section 1.5.1.1 
and that used for diversity performance evaluation is the multichannel receiver 
and multichannel ADC shown in Figure 1.12. For a two-branch diversity sys­
tem, two identical receiving subsystems are required for the simultaneous mea­
surement of the received signals from the two antennas. A portable spectrum 
analyzer can be used as a receiver for the measurement system; a commercially 
available wideband receiver can also be used for the same purpose. The two in­
dependent receiver subsystems should also be calibrated using a known power 
level standard as an input to each channel. There can often be a discrepancy of 
1 to 2 dB between the two receivers; this discrepancy must be calibrated. When 
a mobile terminal moves at a speed of 80 km/h, the required sampling rate is 
0.68 ms in order to satisfy the λ/20 sampling interval at 1GHz. A multichannel 
analog-to-digital (ADC) usually has a sampling rate of less than a few µs and 
therefore does not affect the overall sampling rate of the system.

To simplify the measurement system, one receiver can be used with mul­
tiple antennas. In order to perform the measurement, the technique of switch­
ing between different antennas at a specified switching rate is used. The specific 
switching rate requirements for such a system will be discussed in Section 1.5.3.
1.5.1.3  Delay Profile Measurement
The delay profile measurement system is shown in Figure 1.13. In order to 
perform this type of measurement, a precise timing signal is essential for both 
the transmitter and the receiver. If the receiving points are located close to the 
transmitter, a common signal generator source can be used to supply the timing 
signal to both the transmitter and the receiver, using coaxial cable. For mobile 
terminal measurements, however, the use of cables is not feasible. A rubidium 
oscillator in a standard signal generator synchronizes the oscillators used in the 
transmitter and the receiver.
When performing a delay profile measurement indoors, the transmitting 
and receiving antennas can both be connected to a vector network analyzer in 
order to obtain the received signal time domain characteristics. After perform­
ing the measurement over a wide frequency range, the transmission coefficient 
(S21) frequency data is transformed from the frequency domain into the time 
domain using Fourier transformations. The definition of the S parameters mea­
sured by the network analyzer will be described in Chapter 2. This is the sim­
plest method for obtaining the time domain delay profile. However, it should 
be noted that the measurement resolution is dependent upon the frequency 
bandwidth of the antennas used.
1.5.1.4  Base Station Maintenance and Testing
A propagation measurement is also required when checking the performance 
of the base station antenna and the corresponding coverage area. This measure­
ment is made using a receiver placed on a vehicle to reduce the time required 
to perform a measurement over a wide coverage area [8]. Figure 1.14 shows 
a typical on-board receiver configuration used to measure the received signal

strength. The system consists of the following subsystems: a location detector, 
a data processor, and an electric field strength measuring device. The location 
detection subsystem is used to estimate the precise position of the vehicle and 
consists of a directional sensor, a distance sensor, route history data, and a road­
map stored in a CD-ROM to help generate the measurement route history. 
Multiple measuring receivers are also placed onboard to allow the simultaneous 
measurement of multiple radio channels.
1.5.2  Calibration
For precise propagation measurements, the calibration procedure is very im­
portant. For this type of measurement, two types of calibration procedure are

generally used. The first involves the linearity compensation of the receiver in 
such systems as those described in Sections 1.5.1.1, 1.5.1.2, and 1.5.1.3. The 
second type of calibration procedure is that of time standard calibration, and 
is generally used in the measurement system described in Section 1.5.1.3. The 
calibration of the system is carried out by connecting the signal generator out­
put directly to the antenna input port of the receiver. Figure 1.15 shows a cali­
bration chart of the detector system output power versus the detected signal 
level. This chart may be used to help compensate for the effects of the detector 
nonlinearity in the measured received signal data. This detector system calibra­
tion is best carried out in advance of the actual measurement.
In order to synchronize the phase of the signal between the transmission 
and reception systems, the two rubidium oscillators are synchronized before 
the actual measurement. However, this synchronization may last for a period of 
only a few days, and for a precise measurement, the synchronization procedure 
must be repeated every two to three hours.

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
1.5.3  Antenna Switching Measurement System 
The conventional propagation measurement system uses a diversity antenna in 
conjunction with the corresponding number of calibrated receivers to detect 
several input signals simultaneously. As was mentioned previously, the received 
signal envelope is recorded on a laptop computer at regular sampling intervals 
in time. For indoor propagation measurements, several receivers are required to 
obtain the characteristics of the different diversity branches. Each time a mea­
surement is made, it is necessary to calibrate the system. A simple calibration-
free measurement procedure using a single receiver with an antenna switching 
unit will be presented in this section. This system will be described in detail 
because it forms the basis for all propagation measurement systems.
Figure 1.16 shows the block diagram of the measurement system. An 
antenna switch consisting of three GaAs chips with dummy loads selects the 
received signals alternatively from two antennas. When one antenna is selected, 
the remaining antenna is terminated by a 50 ohm dummy load. This provides 
an isolation of 60 dB and an insertion loss of 1.3 dB below 1 GHz. This type of 
switch is inexpensive compared with a pin diode switch and is ideal for low cost 
measurement systems. The received signal is amplified by 15.1 dB and is then 
converted to an intermediate frequency (IF) signal (at10.7 MHz) by a receiver 
IC chip (IC-R9000). The IF signal is then detected by a standard envelope 
detector of a type used in FM IF transceivers and mobile phones. In order to 
obtain a rapid system response, it is necessary to use a wide bandwidth filter. 
The bandwidths selected for this particular system were 230 kHz for the first 
filter and 30 kHz for the second. The detected envelope signal level is recorded 
in a digital data format using a two-channel A/D converter. The measurement 
system is compact and can be placed on a portable trolley for convenience.
To characterize diversity antennas, several antenna signals are received si­
multaneously. When the sampling interval is small enough to neglect the time

deviation between samples, they may be sampled simultaneously. The maximum 
sampling rate gives an estimate of the short range measurement parameters. 
An interval of λ/40 is sufficiently short so that the received signal enve­
lope can be considered constant between measurements. This result is given by 
switching two output ports of a space diversity antenna consisting of two quar­
ter wavelength monopoles with a 3/4 wavelength spacing [7]. The correspond­
ing switching rate of 66 Hz is short enough to apply to a stationary environ­
ment because the velocity of people moving in the building is less than 1 m/s. 
For this particular diversity antenna system, with a sampling interval of λ/40 
and the antenna switching rate indicated above, it means that the sampling rate 
for a single antenna is λ/20. This is the reason for choosing the envelope signal 
level, as described in Section 1.5.1.1, for short range measurement without the 
use of interpolation.
1.5.4  Tips in Propagation Measurement
A problem in propagation measurement is how to remove the electrical effect of 
supporting structure of handset antennas and feeding cables. The tested hand­
sets are usually held by low dielectric constant materials, such as polyethylene 
foam, wood, and corrugated fiberboard. In the measurements, we need receiv­
ers and data recording devices, which are made by a metal frame. To minimize 
the pattern distortions by electrical obstacles, the equipment should be placed 
away from tested devices. In the experience in early days’ propagation measure­
ments at 900 MHz band, tested devices were at least 1m away from the con­
ducting materials. It is 3λ in free space.

A theoretical background is given by the concept of antenna clearance [9]. 
An antenna needs some space to be operated in a stable state. It is called antenna 
clearance and is calculated by placing an electrical obstacle in the vicinity of 
tested antenna. A simple obstacle is a λ/2 conducting wire to disturb antenna 
input characteristics and radiation patterns. The input impedance is changed 
seriously by this wire when the wire distance is less than λ, while the radiation 
patterns’ deviation is not converged for this spacing. For example, an H-plane 
radiation pattern of λ/2 dipole antenna is seriously affected by the presence of 
λ/2 conducting wire arrayed in parallel. A ripple of H-plane radiation pattern is 
±2.4 dB for the distance d = λ between dipole and wire, and is ±0.8 dB for d = 
3λ. The pattern deviation less than ±1 dB is guaranteed for the tested devices at 
least 3λ away from the electrical obstacles.

Antenna Measurements for Radio 
Handsets and Mobile Terminals
In the design and development of new antennas for radio handsets and mo­
bile terminals, a prime consideration is the impedance matching requirements 
of the antenna input port. Once the antenna input port impedance has been 
suitably matched, the next parameter to be measured is the antenna radiation 
pattern. The performance of the newly design antenna may be measured in an 
indoor location before final testing in a real propagation environment. Sections 
2.1 and 2.2 deal with parameter definitions for impedance and radiation pat­
tern measurements. In order to produce miniature communications products, 
electrically small antennas are often used. However, electrically small antennas 
do not always have a low radiation efficiency, but they usually have low total 
antenna efficiency because they are often hard to match due to high reactance. 
A typical example of this type of antenna is a pager antenna. The frequency 
bandwidth characteristics of the antenna may be obtained by measuring the 
antenna impedance over a range of frequencies. To obtain the antenna radiation 
efficiency, another measurement approach is required and is discussed in  Sec­
tion 2.3. Some mobile communication systems require the incorporation of di­
versity function antennas. As described in Chapter 1, the diversity performance 
of the antenna is usually obtained by propagation measurements. However, the 
diversity characteristics may also be derived from the complex radiation pattern 
of the antenna through a mathematical model that describes the arrival of elec­
tromagnetic waves from various regions of the space surrounding the antenna. 
Section 2.4 describes this method.
In addition to the above measurements, an electromagnetic compatibil­
ity (EMC) or electromagnetic emission (EMI) test is a mandatory requirement 
before releasing the antenna as a commercial product. This is done in order to

ensure that the antenna meets national wireless regulatory standards. A typical 
measurement method used for this purpose is described in the latter parts of the 
chapter. In Section 2.5, mobile terminal antenna tests used for product evalu­
ation are presented. This chapter deals with the necessary measurement proce­
dures for handset and mobile terminal antennas. The measurement procedures 
required for the evaluation of the base station antenna performance are left to 
be discussed in Chapter 4.
2.1  Antenna Input Port Impedance Measurements
Most RF output ports are designed to have an impedance of 50Ω; thus the 
antenna input impedance is required to be matched to this value. The imped­
ance matching of the antenna is described by the Voltage Standing Wave Ratio 
(VSWR) or the return loss. However, before giving details of its measurement 
procedure, the definitions of some basic terminology are required.
2.1.1  Reflection Coefficient
A definition for the reflection coefficient may be derived from the model shown 
in Figure 2.1, which illustrates an impedance mismatch situation between a 
transmission line of impedance Zo and a terminating load of impedance Zi (the 
antenna). The reflection coefficient Γ for the terminating impedance is defined 
according to the equation:

(2.1)
In actual measurements, the reflected power at the antenna input port is 
used as a measure of the impedance mismatch factor. This reflected power is 
defined by (2.2). This factor is often described as the return loss in the antenna 
community. However, it is a mistake, as the return loss is defined as being 
positive.

(2.2)
As shown in Figure 2.1, the impedance mismatch between the transmis­
sion line and the antenna sets up a standing wave along the transmission line. 
The ratio between the maximum voltage, Vmax, and the minimum voltage, 
Vmin, then defines the VSWR, denoted by ρ, as follows:

Thus, the degree of impedance mismatch between the transmission line 
and the antenna may be defined by the VSWR.Examples of typical VSWR 
value for standard communication system antennas are

 for high power 
broadcasting station transmit antennas, 
1.5

 for cellular base station anten­
nas and

ρ ≤ or

2.1.2  The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio, S-Parameters, and the Smith Chart
The classical approach chosen for measuring the VSWR utilizes coaxial wave­
guides. The standing wave excited inside the coaxial waveguide is measured 
directly by a probe inserted through a slit made in the outer conducting wall 
of a waveguide. A standard measurement procedure utilizing this method is 
described in this section. Initially, the physical location of the first node of the 
standing wave for the coaxial cable under short circuit conditions is marked. As 
can be seen in Figure 2.2, when the device under test (DUT), in this case an 
antenna, is connected to the end of the coaxial waveguide, the node position 
is found to shift towards the DUT terminal point, in this case to a distance ld 
from the DUT terminal.
The impedance of any device may be illustrated in a 2D complex plane 
representation, which is referred to as the Smith chart (see Figure 2.3) [1]. This 
chart represents a mapping of constant-resistance and constant-reactance com­
ponents of the DUT onto the complex reflection coefficient plane, using the 
following equation:

A circle of radius ρ is drawn on the Smith chart to represent the VSWR

This fundamental measurement method is also used for impedance mis­
match measurements in high power transmission lines. The most commonly 
used device for measuring the impedance of radio frequency devices is a net­
work analyzer. The input impedance of an individual dipole, as well as the mu­
tual impedance of a dipole pair, may be measured using a network analyzer (see 
Figure 2.4). In an actual measurement, a balun is required to connect the dipole 
to the network analyzer. Baluns described in the preceding section are removed 
from this figure for the simplicity. a1, a2 and b1, b2 denote the amplitude of 
the incident and reflected waves from dipole antennas #1 and #2, respectively.

It is the S-parameters shown in the scattering matrix which are directly

lyzer has two measurement ports. The complex signal levels extracted via the

impedances are given by the measured value obtained directly from the network 
analyzer.
Other important points concerning the correct usage of the network ana­
lyzer are: sufficient time to allow the instrument to warm up before performing 
the measurement; correct instrument calibration; and a proper reference plane 
for the connectors. For stable network analyzer operations, the instrument must

be allowed to warm up for a period of 30 to 60 minutes. The calibration pro­
cedure to obtain correctly referenced amplitude and phase values of the signals 
under analysis must be carried out after the instrument’s warming up period is 
complete using a calibration kit supplied by the instrument manufacturer. To 
obtain measurements of as high a precision as possible, the minimum frequency 
bandwidth used during measurements must be covered by the calibration pro­
cess. Lastly, in order to derive the correct impedance value, the position of the 
reference plane of the measurements must also be taken into account. As can 
be seen from Figure 2.6, the reference plane for the measurements is normally 
located on the surface of the dielectric material on the inside of the connector. 
2.1.3  The S-Parameter Method
An S-parameter method was proposed to measure the input impedance of bal­
anced antennas viewed as two-port network system [2]. This method is extend­
ed to measure asymmetrical antenna structures, such as monopoles and small 
antennas on handset terminals [3]. An input port of these antennas is viewed as 
a two-port [shown in Figure 2.7(a)], assuming a virtual short-port at the center 
of antenna input port. A symmetric current condition of I1=-I2 provides each 
reflection coefficient S1 and S2:

This method can be extended to measure the radiation pattern of asym­
metrical antenna structure by removing the effect of current flowing on the out­
er surface of coaxial cable. After measuring two radiation patterns, E1 excited 
by a port 1 and E2 by a port 2, the radiation pattern of symmetric condition is 
given as E1 + αE2. This synthesized pattern eliminates the effect of feeding cable 
as shown in Figure 2.8. In this example, a normal mode helical antenna on a 
small casing was measured at 315 MHz [4]. The principal pattern is well agreed 
with measurement by S-parameter method in Figure 2.8(a), while it is seriously 
distorted by the measurement of antenna connected directly to coaxial cable in 
Figure 2.8(b). Error in cross-pol pattern is also reduced in Figure 2.8(a), thus 
the S-parameter method is effective for radiation pattern measurement.
2.1.4  Balanced and Unbalanced Feeder Systems
Feed transmission line feeds for antennas may be classified into two kinds; bal­
anced or unbalanced. The Lecher line (shown in Figure 2.9) is an antenna feed­
er composed of a pair of parallel conducting wires that supplies out-of-phase 
currents and voltages. However, in modern mobile communication systems, it 
is more common to use a coaxial feed. The coaxial cable is classified as an un­
balanced line because the voltage on the outer conductor of the cable is always 
zero.
Another name for this type of transmission cable is a shielded cable. It 
is referred to as a shielded cable because the outer conductor is connected to 
electrical earth and effectively shields the cable from the effects of external radio 
frequency (RF) noise. These two different types of transmission lines, balanced 
and unbalanced, cannot be connected together directly, but must be connected 
via a voltage transformer (as shown in Figure 2.10). The voltage transformer 
consists of a pair of inductors and a pair of capacitors connected in the form 
of a bridge circuit, and is effective in the very high frequency (VHF) frequency 
region. A transformer called a balun is required for the UHF frequency band.
In antenna measurements, a half-wavelength dipole is often taken as a 
standard antenna. The antenna consists of two electrical poles excited by a bal­
anced transmission line. For measurement purposes, the coaxial cable is an ap­
propriate transmission line because the intrinsic shielding ability of the cable 
ensures that there is no RF interference from surrounding equipment. If, how­
ever, a dipole antenna is fed by a coaxial cable, undesired currents will flow 
on the outer conductor of the cable. This leakage current can be suppressed by 
using a bazooka balunas, as shown in Figure 2.11. This type of balun consists of 
a double coaxial cable. Because the balun has an electrical length of λ/4, the im­
pedance at the opening of the cable becomes infinite, effectively preventing the 
flow of leakage current from the dipole. In addition to the balun, in the UHF 
band a ferrite ring is usually used to suppress unwanted leakage current and this 

48 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
is often used in mobile handset receiving antennas. To suppress the leakage cur­
rent effectively, the coaxial cable may be wrapped around a ferrite bead, but this 
process incurs additional losses in the antenna. In this case, the leakage current 
is dissipated as thermal losses.

In handset antenna designs, the chassis of the handset is modeled as a 
conducting box, as shown in Figure 2.12. A monopole antenna creates a leakage 
current on the chassis because the box acts as the complementary virtual pole 
of the monopole.

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
The antenna leakage current flows on the outside of the handset chassis 
and has a great influence on the resulting antenna radiation pattern. As mobile 
phone handsets also employ several built-in antennas for different frequency 
bands, current leakage to the handset chassis also causes similar problems to the 
antenna radiation characteristics. Thus, in order to suppress this leakage cur­
rent, a balun is necessary for performing proper antenna impedance and pattern 
measurements. Several basic types of balun are discussed in [3].
Dipole antennas fed by a balanced line are sometimes used in mobile 
communication systems. When it is necessary to measure the input impedance 
characteristics of the balanced line feeding the antenna, a method referred to 
as the Image Method is used; this method utilizes a network analyzer. Figure 
2.13 shows a typical measurement set-up for a Yagi-array antenna. The antenna 
structure is divided into two halves about the central symmetrical axis. One 
half of the antenna is mounted on a large electrical ground plane that includes 
the antenna feed point. This method is used to measure the input impedance 
of the antenna. Physically, the measured antenna is only one half of the actual 
antenna structure and thus the true input impedance of the antenna is twice the 
measured impedance value.

2.1.5  Effect of Finite Size Ground Plane
Compact planar antennas used in mobile communications applications are 
generally mounted on an electrical ground plane and fed via a coaxial cable. 
The impedance characteristics of the antenna are heavily dependent upon the 
area of the conducting ground plane. If the ground plane is not of sufficient 
area, the measured impedance characteristics of the antenna become a function 
of the area and are proved to be different from those predicted for an infinite 
ground plane.
In practical applications it is impossible to mount the planar antenna on 
an infinite ground plane, However, in order to obtain good impedance char­
acteristics, a circular ground plane with a radius of at least 1.5λ can be used. 
This value is chosen because it offers an impedance value that within 5% of the 
infinite plane value. This is shown in the simulation example given in Figure 
2.14. The calculations have been performed using the finite difference time 
domain (FDTD) method [4], and give the same results as the method of mo­
ment (MOM) [5]. The numerical simulation shows that the input impedance 
is very unstable for ground plane of lengths of less than 1.3λ. If the ground 
plane is too small, then the current spreads to the edges of the plane and flows 
along the rear surface and eventually to the outer conductor of the feeder. A 
leakage current flowing on the outside of the conducting coaxial feed causes 
this instability. If the ground plane is of sufficient size, this current decreases to 
zero before reaching the edges of the plane and thus gives a more stable imped­
ance characteristic.
Another possible shape of finite ground plane is square; Figure 2.14(b) 
shows the input impedance of a monopole antenna mounted on a square-
shaped ground plane as a function of the side length. The input impedance 
convergence is better for a square-shaped ground plane than a circular one. The 
reason is that the current return path for the case of the circular ground plane 
is of the same length, while a square ground plane allows for many different 
currents. However, the square ground plant has a disadvantage: it creates a large 
cross polarization component in the horizontal planebecause of thedifferent 
length current paths. Figure 2.15 shows the radiation patterns in the horizon­
tal plane for circular and square-shaped ground planes. The cross-polarization 
level is lower with the circular ground plane, and this is an advantage to use this 
shape.
2.2  Radiation Pattern Measurement
Another important antenna design parameter is the far-field radiation pattern. 
The radiation field for an antenna consists of a near-field region close to the 

52 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
antenna and a radiative field region (far-field) far away from the antenna. In the 
case of the radiative field region, the electric field strength is in general inversely 
proportional to the distance from the antenna. To understand the antenna ra­
diation field, the near- and far-field distances must be clearly defined. This sec­
tion presents the parameters that define the far-field distance from the antenna 
as well as describing a measurement system for the far-field radiation pattern. In 
Section 4.3.2, a near-field measurement system is also described.

For the phase error to be less than π/8, the distance R from the antenna 
must be such that:

(2.15)
The above equation is often used to define the far field measurement 
distance for the antenna. This phase error, however, limits the dynamic range of 
the radiation pattern. If the distance R satisfies the condition of (2.15), a mea­
sured pattern of less than –23 dB of the peak radiation level contains measure­
ment error [7], or null positions of the pattern are difficult to find accurately. 
Thus, for this particular case, the dynamic range for a phase error of π/8 
is 23 dB. It is therefore meaningless to discuss radiation field levels below this 
23 dB level for a phase error definition of π/8. If, however, the defined phase 
error level is halved to π/16, then the far field distance, as defined by (2.15), 
is doubled, and the dynamic range of the antenna will also be increased to 25 
dB. Thus, when defining the far field distance of the antenna, the relationship 
between the phase error and the dynamic range must be kept in mind. 
2.2.2  Measurement System Setup [8]
In far-field measurements, the distance between the transmitter and the re­
ceiver should be sufficiently large enough to satisfy the far field condition stated 
above. For large base station antennas with high gain in mobile communication 
systems, the antenna radiation field is measured in an outdoor environment. 
The measurement environment should be in a location where there is very little 
RF noise present. The criteria for site selection, as well as details concerning 
the measurement apparatus required, will be described in Chapter 4. For the

measurement of low and medium gain antennas used on mobile terminals, an 
indoor measurement environment may be used. Details concerning the cham­
ber geometry and the measurement equipment requirements for these types of 
antennas will be presented in this section.
The most common type of radio frequency anechoic chamber has a square 
cross-section with electromagnetic wave absorber placed on the inner walls of 
the chamber, as shown in Figure 2.17(a). The transmit antenna and the antenna 
under test (AUT) are placed near the side walls of the chamber to satisfy a re­
flection wave level of less than –30 dB. This region is referred to as the quiet 
zone of the chamber, and is defined as a sphere of a given radius centered on the 
AUT as shown in Figure 2.17(b).
In the UHF band, the type of wave absorber used consists of urethane 
foam in which carbon particles are embedded. For normally incident waves, the 
level of signal reflection is reduced to less than –20 dB. For the case of obliquely 
incident waves, the absorber performance is degraded.
To suppress the signal reflection for obliquely incident waves, the RF ab­
sorber is shaped in the form of a pyramid. The obliquely incident wave under­
goes multiple reflections as it bounces between opposing faces of the pyramidal 
blocks. With each reflection, the wave signal strength is gradually reduced, and 
so the shape of the absorber helps to reduce the level of signal reflected back 
towards the antenna.
An example of another type of chamber geometry is shown in Figure 
2.17(c). This is referred to as a tapered chamber, and this type of chamber geom­
etry helps to reduce the overall volume occupied by the chamber. The transmit 
antenna is installed at the top of the chamber taper and radiates a quasiplane 
wave towards the antenna that is under test. The reason why a quasiplane wave 
is radiated from the transmit antenna has to do with the close proximity of 
the RF absorber to the antenna. This type of testing chamber can be used for 
measurements below 1 GHz and is generally of low-cost. An example of the 
measurement setup is shown in Figure 2.18. The radiating antenna is placed at 
the center of the quiet zone, and the antenna under test is mounted on a rotat­
ing table on the opposite side of the chamber. The AUT can either be rotated 
continuously or, incrementally a step motor by 360 degrees to measure the an­
tenna pattern in a specific pattern. A signal generator is used to excite the source 
antenna, while the AUT is connected to a receiver. Good system measurement 
requires a dynamic range of more than 40 dB, and this can be achieved using 
a phase lock loop (PLL) receiver. At high frequencies (>1 GHz), a harmonic 
mixer is often placed near the test antenna to overcome transmission losses 
through the coaxial cable by down converting the received signal.
The types of source antenna that are generally used in this particular 
measurement system include: a dipole antenna, a Yagi array, a pyramidal horn, 
a double ridged horn, and a log-periodic antenna. The frequency bandwidth

characteristics and cross-polarization level of the source antenna should be 
taken into account when determining the specifications for the measurement 
system. For example, frequency ranges for standard antennas can be taken to be 
the following: a dipole (<1 GHz); a double-ridged horn or log periodic (1~20 
GHz); or a pyramidal horn (>10 GHz). These are all examples of antennas with 
linearly polarized radiation patterns. If a circularly polarized radiation field is 
required, then a helical or loop antenna may be employed.
For measurements with low gain antennas where the distance between the 
antennas is relatively short, a network analyzer may be used. The two antennas 
are connected to the two ports of the network analyzer and a S21 measurement 
is performed. This is a comparatively low-cost system, but the dynamic range 
is not very large.
2.2.3  Far-Field Measurement
2.2.3.1  Amplitude Pattern Measurement
For the case of field pattern measurements on linearly polarized antennas, the 
transmitting and receiving antennas are first aligned so that the polarization 
vectors are in the same plane. After this is done, the measurement is performed 
as described in Section 2.2.2. On the other hand, for circularly polarized an­
tennas, two measurement procedures are required. Before proceeding to a de­
scription of circular polarization measurement, it is first necessary to define the 
cross-polarization ratio (XPR) and the axial ratio (AR).
A circularly polarized radiation field is expressed by:

personal computer (PC) can be used to control the data acquisition system and the rotation 
angle of the DUT automatically.

A standard antenna used in circular polarization measurements can be a

larization case, the axial ratio is defined as the ratio between the maximum and 
minimum amplitudes as:

Another common measurement performed for circular polarized anten­
nas is the so-called “spin linear technique,” wherein a linearly polarized stan­
dard antenna is rotated much faster than the azimuth rotation of the DUT. A 
radiation pattern measured using this method is shown in Figure 2.20. The 
peak-to-peak level of the ripple in the pattern gives the axial ratio of the DUT.
2.2.3.2  Gain Measurement 
Antenna gain is classified into directive gain and absolute gain. The definition 
of directive gain does not include input impedance mismatch losses or losses 
within the antenna (e.g., ohmic losses). It defines only the directivity of the 
AUT (i.e., the spatial distribution of radiated power from the antenna). The 
absolute gain includes all sources of loss for the antenna and is the term most 
often used when specifying the transmission power and link budget margin in 
real operating environments. The absolute antenna gain, Gs, is measured by 
comparing the received electric field strength between the standard gain an­
tenna and the DUT. An example of the absolute gain of a standard antenna is 
Gs = 2.15 dBi for a half wavelength dipole antenna. An antenna with this value 
of gain can be used to measure a DUT with an expected gain, Gd, of less than 
15 dBi. A standard high gain pyramidal horn antenna, however, can be used

to measure antennas with an expected gain in the range 15 dBi to 35 dBi. This 
criterion is not determined theoretically, but is derived empirically by evaluat­
ing the measured data from relative gain measurementwith various types of an­
tenna. Figure 2.21(a) shows a typical measurement setup. For low gain antennas 
with gains of less than 10 dBi, the gain measurement can be performed inside 
an anechoic chamber.
The received electric field strength E is measured in units of dΒµV, using 
a standard antenna with an antenna gain Gs measured in advance. Using the 
same experimental setup, the test antenna replaces the standard antenna and 
once again the electric field strength is measured.

A more precise gain measurement may be carried out using a calibrated 
attenuator; the measurement setup is shown in Figure 2.21(b). The attenuator 
is inserted between the standard antenna and the receiver and is adjusted until 
the received signal levels from both the standard antenna and the DUT become 
equal. If the attenuation level is La, the antenna gain may be obtained from:

system for the measurement. Measurement of the θ angle is performed in the 
elevation plane (0 ≤ θ ≤ π) and of the φ angle in the azimuth plane (0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π).
When measurement of the antenna radiation pattern for both the prin­
cipal and cross-polarization components is performed over the whole of space, 
the directivity gain, as defined by (2.23), is obtained because the power density

The pattern integration method requires the receiving probe to be moved 
in a spherical or hemispherical pattern. For the measurement system shown 
in Figure 2.23(a), the DUT is stationary while the receive antenna is moved 
through a semicircle on the holding frame. The plane of the measurement is 
gradually shifted through 180° until a full hemisphere is covered. On the other 
hand, in Figure 2.23(b) the receive antenna is moved through a quarter circle 
while the DUT is rotated through 360° in order to cover a full hemisphere. In 
Figure 2.23(b), the semicircular frame on which the receive antenna is mounted

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
is placed on a ground plane in order to use the image of the DUT radiation 
pattern. Otherwise, a microwave absorber must cover the floor on which the 
DUT is mounted to suppress multipath reflections [Figure 2.23(b)]. It should 
be noted, however, that if the image method of measurement is to be adopted 
(as described in Section 2.1.3), the DUT must be physically symmetrical about 
a given plane.
For the measurement system shown in Figure 2.23(b), the test antenna 
must be scanned twice in each plane to measure the normal and cross-polariza­
tions of the DUT pattern by rotating the receive antenna by 90 degrees. This 
process then gives data for a semicircle in one plane of measurement. The same 
measurement is then performed after resetting the DUT to cover the spherical 
surface. This method of scanning creates a spatial map of the radiation field of

2.3  Radiation Efficiency Measurement
The demand for miniaturized portable handset designs in mobile communica­
tion systems has placed severe restrictions on the size of antennas. It is well-
known that electrically small antennas suffer from deterioration in the antenna 
performance, including reduced frequency bandwidth, radiation efficiency, and 
antenna gain. The term electrically small for an antenna that fits inside a sphere 
with a radius λ/2π.This scale was introduced by Wheeler as the radiation power 
factor concept [9] and by Chu to derive the minimum Q by expanding the field 
around an infinitesimal current element [10]. The radiation efficiency of such 
antennas rapidly decreases with a reduction in the antenna size. For portable 
pagers operating in the VHF band, this is often a serious problem. The radia­
tion efficiency of an antenna is thus an important parameter to be considered 
in the design and measurement of new antennas for mobile communications. 
In Section 2.3, the radiation efficiency is defined and several measurement tech­
niques appropriate to small antennas are described.
2.3.1  Definition of Radiation Efficiency
Losses in antennas, Rl, include ohmic loss in the conductor, and dielectric loss 
in the dielectric material of the antenna, if present. When the radiated power 
from the antenna is given as radiation resistance Rr, the radiation efficiency is 
defined as:

(2.26)
2.3.2  The Wheeler Cap Method
The antenna input impedance value includes both radiation resistance and 
ohmic loss. If only the ohmic losses are accounted for in the measurement, the 

64 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
radiation efficiency can be calculated according to (2.23). Wheeler proposed a 
method to measure the ohmic losses of small antennas by covering the antenna 
with a small conducting cap, as shown in Figure 2.24 [11, 12]. In this mea­
surement, the antenna should be mounted above a ground plane. The original 
method suggested the use of a cap with a radius, a, where a must satisfy the con­
dition koa < 1 and ko = 2π/λ is the wave number in free-space. This criterion is 
based on the radiation characteristics of an infinitely small current element such 
that the reactive power (that is not related to the radiation) is the dominant 
component in the vicinity of the antenna. However, experimental data from 
several sources indicates that it is not necessary for the spherical cap to adhere 
closely to this criterion [13]. It is only necessary for the cap length to be less 
than a half wavelength so as to prevent any resonances in the cap. An alternative 
cap shape to the hemispherical cap is a box type [14].
Current flow on the antenna is not affected by the cap, which only affects 
the ohmic and dielectric losses in the antenna. The measured resistance of the 
antenna covered by the cap is equivalent to the ohmic losses in the antenna, 
while the real part of the measured input impedance of the antenna without the 
cap includes the radiation and ohmic losses. Thus, using these two measured 
values, it is possible to find the radiation efficiency of the antenna using (2.23). 
A theoretical evaluation of the Wheeler cap method shows that this method 
highly accurate for antennas with the radiation efficiencies of less than 90%. 
Any resonances between the antenna and the cap can cause increased 
measurement error. The measurement accuracy can thus be a function of the 
frequency and any resonances present in the measurement will appear as a 
small dip or spike in the measurement curve. The frequency characteristic of 
Figure 2.24  Wheeler cap method.

the measurement can therefore give an indication of possible resonances in the 
experimental setup.
To remove a cavity resonance in the Wheeler cap method the cavity is 
replaced by a rectangular waveguide terminated in movable short circuiting 
plungers to change the resonance condition [16]. An antenna under test is in­
serted into this cavity; its equivalent transmission model is given in Figure 2.25. 
The reflection coefficient of movable plunger does not have an ideal value of 
unity, but is determined by a small normalized resistance of rc. The value of 
rc is determined by measuring the locus of antenna impedance on the Smith 
chart [17]. Deep nulls of measured efficiency are caused by the condition of

where Pr and Pl are the radiated power and power loss within the antenna, re­

can be measured by a power meter connected to the transmitter power output 
port. The radiation power, Pr, may be obtained by measuring the far-field pat­
tern of the test antenna using a receive antenna of known gain Gr. This mea­
surement procedure is the same as that described in Section 2.2.2.

where θI = (i–1)∆θ and φi  = (j–1)∆φ are defined by the number of partitions in 
each coordinate as ∆θ = π/Nθ and ∆φ = 2π/Nφ. The radiated power measured 
in (2.29) is called the total radiation power (TRP). When the input power Pi 
to AUT is known in advance or measured, the radiation efficiency is given by 
η = Pr/Pi.
This pattern integration method is provided by great circle method and 
conical cut method, as shown in Figure 2.26. The AUT is rotated along two 
axes in the former method. The weight of the AUT and the effect of support­
ing post should be considered; the latter one needs a high precision scanning 
along an arc-shaped supporting structure. In these measurements, the number 
of partitions in each coordinate should be smaller than the variation of received 
field strength in each measurement point. CTIA Certification recommends the 
partition angle of ∆θ = ∆φ = 15° for the TRP measurement [18]. For TRP

measurement with built-in antenna on laptop PC, the measurement error is 
suppressed less than 0.1 dB by taking the partition angle less than 15 degrees 
∆θ = ∆φ ≤ 15° [19].
2.3.4  Relative Gain Measurement (Random Field Measurement)
The random field measurement (RFM) method is an experimental method 
for measuring the antenna gain that does not require the use of a large-scale 
anechoic chamber [20]. The measurement procedure is the same as that for the 
attenuation coefficient measurement described in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2. A 
short measurement range is adopted for this method and a measurement site, 
such as the area around a tall building, may be selected (this was described in 
Chapter 1, Section 1.2.5). The receiver is located far from the building at a

distance of a few hundred meters or more, and makes use of multiple scattered 
signal paths from the transmitter to the receiver (mobile terminal). The mobile 
terminal is first moved along a predefined route using a standard antenna of 
gain Gs; a standard antenna, such as a dipole antenna, is suitable for this type of 
measurement. The received signal strength (Ps) is recorded and used as a refer­
ence signal for the next measurement involving replacement of the standard 
antenna by the DUT. The DUT on the mobile terminal is then moved along 
the same predefined route as before, and the received signal strength (PDUT) is 
once again recorded. The relative gain can thus be calculated by taking the ratio 
of PDUT to Ps. This measurement procedure is the same as that for short-range 
propagation measurements where the median of the signal is adopted as the 
standard antenna received power level.

If the measurement is performed with an operator holding the handheld

antennas like those used in mobile phones.
2.4  Diversity Characteristics Measurement Using Radiation 
Pattern
To reduce fading effect in the real propagation environment, diversity recep­
tion (described in Chapter 1, Section 1.3) is used for mobile terminals. The 
diversity performance is obtained by means of the propagation measurement as 
described in Chapter 1, Section 1.5.1, but it can also be evaluated by measuring 
the phase and amplitude pattern (complex radiation pattern) of the antenna. 
This section presents the definition of diversity measurement using complex 
pattern and its measurement procedure.
2.4.1  Definition of Correlation Coefficient Using Complex Pattern
Diversity performance may be characterized by the correlation coefficient

These equations assume that N waves are incidents upon the antenna 
with an amplitude Ei and a phase φI, where G1i and G2i are the antenna gain 
figures in the direction of the i-th incident wave, and ko is the wave number in 
free-space. The vectors r and d are, respectively, the unit direction vector for 
the incident wave Ei and the location vector of antenna number 2 relative to 
antenna number 1, which is located at the origin of the coordinate system.
For the case where the phase of the incoming wave is changing randomly 
with time and the incoming waves all have the same amplitude, the mean values 
of e1 and e2 become zero, as <e1> = <e2> = 0. Hence the numerator in (1.16) is

Using (2.38) and (2.39), the correlation coefficient for a two-branch di­
versity antenna can be evaluated by measuring the amplitude and phase of the 
radiation pattern for each antenna individually over the whole of space.

For the poor accuracy antenna, an expression for the uncertainty of cor­
relation is discussed in [23]. 
The correlation coefficient for each equation is evaluated using a two-
element dipole array as shown in Figure 2.28. Here, ρ2D and ρ3D are calculated 
using the complex radiation pattern of horizontal plane and of whole space for 
uniform incoming wave distribution. because ρ2D, ρ3D, and ρS include the ef­
fect of mutual coupling, the correlation without mutual coupling is also shown 
as ρB. The correlation coefficients of ρ2D, ρ3D, and ρS are less than ρB due to 
the radiation pattern distortion by the mutual coupling. These three types of 
correlations have similar characteristics in narrow interelement spacing, and we 
may use ρ3D or ρB to evaluate the performance of AUT under the assumption 
of uniform incoming wave. It is necessary to use ρ3D when the incoming wave 
has a special angular distribution. 
2.4.3  Diversity Measurement Procedure
As was shown in Section 2.4.2, in order to evaluate the correlation coefficient of 
a diversity antenna, the complex radiation pattern is first required. The complex 
radiation pattern may be measured, or calculated numerically using computer 
Figure 2.28  Complex correlation coefficient.

72 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
simulation techniques. In order to evaluate the correlation coefficient, however, 
it is necessary to estimate the distribution function of the incoming waves. 
Measurement of the incoming wave distribution is not easy to perform because 
the measurement requires the use of a very high gain antenna, such as a para­
bolic reflector antenna [24].
In mobile communication applications, an assumption is normally made 
about the incoming wave distribution. As shown in Section 2.4.1, for the case 
when the transmitter is far from the receiving position, it is possible to assume 
that the distribution of incoming waves is uniform in the horizontal plane and 
has a Gaussian distribution in the vertical plane. The distribution function is 
then given as:

where θm is the mean elevation angle of the m-th incoming wave from the hori­
zontal direction, and σm is the standard deviation of  m-th wave distribution 
in the elevation plane. Typical examples of these values are θm = 0 and σm = 40 
degrees for the case of measured data in an urban area [25]. 
By neglecting the distribution function in the elevation plane, the sim­
plest approximation for (2.41) may be given by the following delta function:

If this particular assumption can be adopted, then the radiation pattern 
from the antenna need only be measured in one plane to evaluate the correla­
tion coefficient.
2.5  EMC Measurement
When evaluating handheld communication terminals, it is important to mea­
sure both the main radiated power and the spurious radiated power from the 
terminal. The conventional measurement method is to separately evaluate the 
radiation characteristics of the antenna and the standalone terminal with no 
antenna connected. However, for a realistic evaluation of the communications 
terminal, it is necessary to know the combined frequency characteristics of the 
terminal when joined to the antenna.
The first part of this section describes EMC measurement methods for 
measuring the radiation characteristics of the terminal and antenna together. 

 
Antenna Measurements for Radio Handsets and Mobile Terminals 
73
These include using an open site direct wave method for evaluation, as well as 
the previously mentioned random field measurement method used for evaluat­
ing the terminal performance in a real environment. For these types of measure­
ment, both a large measurement area and a long measurement time are needed. 
To reduce both the space and time required when performing the measure­
ments, several measurement systems that are suitable for use in confined spaces 
are proposed. Sections 2.5.2 and 2.5.3 are devoted to a description of EMC 
evaluation procedures using compact anechoic boxes/chambers.
2.5.1  Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Measurement 
All electronic equipment radiates unwanted electromagnetic waves. These can 
potentially cause interference to other devices. Each country has a standard 
for the acceptable level of electromagnetic interference that a device may emit. 
These national standards are based on the International Special Committee on 
Radio Interference (CISPR) published regulatory standards [26]. In this book, 
we will discuss the frequency range of the EMI measurements from 30 MHz 
to 1 GHz. A standard open site measuring facility used for conducting such 
measurements is shown in Figure 2.29(a); a large chamber is shown in Figure 
2.29(b). In this system, the direct wave from the device under test (DUT), as 
well as the wave reflected via the conducting ground plane, are measured to­
gether by the receive antenna. In indoor testing facilities, a conducting ground 
plane is also used to ensure a good reflection from the ground. Depending 
on the type of DUT under test, the distance D from the DUT to the receive 
antenna may be 3m, 10m, or 30m. For the case of the open site test facility, it 
is important to ensure that there are no other spurious reflections from scat­
tering objects inside the measurement area which is of length 2D and width 
3D. The performance of the site is evaluated by the site attenuation factor. 
The definition of this factor is similar that for propagation loss described in 
Chapter 1, Section 1.1.
We assume that the received signal is the receiving voltage Vd when the 
transmitting cable is directly connected to the receiving cable with the DUT 
and receive antenna removed. The height of the transmit antenna is fixed at H 
and the receive antenna height, h, is changed until the maximum receiving volt­
age Vr is found. The site attenuation factor is then defined as:
	
(
)
d
r

SA
V

α
α

(2.43)
where αt and αr are the feed losses at the transmit and receive antennas. All 
measurements are in units of dB. An acceptable error for the site attenuation is 
±4 dB compared with the expected theoretical value. This error value indicates 

74 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
the difference between an ideal site and a real test site. The measurement error 
for the test site described in [27] is less than 0.3 dB.
To simplify the measurement procedure, the DUT is mounted on a rotat­
ing table, thus enabling the field radiated by the DUT to be measured over a 
full 360 degree circle. To ensure good constructive wave interference between 
the direct and reflected waves from the DUT, the receive antenna height (h) 
is adjusted until the maximum receiving voltage Vm is found. For a distance 
within the range D = 3m to 6m, h is in the range 1m to 4m; for a distance D = 
30m, h is found to be between 2m and 6m. The angular position of the DUT 
relative to the receive antenna is also adjusted until a maximum Vm is found.

wave Factory Co., Ltd.).

For this situation, the incoming electric field level E is calculated using the 
antenna factor (AF):

(2.44)
The antenna factor of a half wavelength dipole antenna is equivalent to 
the effective length λ/π of the antenna. However, it must be remembered that it 
is important to include cable and feed connector losses in the measurement. In 
actual measurement systems, the antenna factor is evaluated by comparing the 
antenna under measurement with a calibrated standard antenna. The AF is then 
given in terms of the calibrated antenna factor AFo and the received voltage Vo 
for the standard antenna as

(2.45)
In this case, the antenna factor is only defined as a constant value for the 
horizontal polarization component. This is because the radiation pattern of the 
vertical dipole changes with the elevation angle, and the AF becomes a function 
of height. To exclude the antenna factor from the site attenuation, the normal­
ized site attenuation (NSA) is defined below:

(2.46)
where AFt and AFr are the antenna factors of the transmit and receive antennas, 
respectively, and ∆NSA is a correction factor for mutual coupling between the 
two antennas and the effect of the earth’s surface [28, 29]. 
Depending on the frequency range of the EMI measurement, the type of 
antenna used differs [30]. For example, in the 30 MHz to 1000 MHz range, a 
half wavelength dipole antenna or a log-periodic dipole array may be used; for 
the 30 MHz to 300 MHz range, a biconical antenna and for 1 GHz. For the 
frequency range above 1 GHz, the standard antenna is selected by the request of 
radiation pattern or directivity; a typical one is a horn antenna. These are typi­
cal examples and radiation patterns, or directivity, of these standard antennas 
also matter for EMI measurement.
2.5.2  Reverberating Enclosure Measurement [31]
The open site measurement method described in Section 2.5.1 is time-consum­
ing because the device under test (DUT) must be rotated in order to scan the 
full 2D or 3D radiation patterns. Additionally, the height of the receive antenna 
must be adjusted until the maximum signal level is found. An alternative mea-

76 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
surement system for EMI measurements is proposed which uses a reverberating 
chamber (see Figure 2.30). The measurement system consists of two flat vanes 
installed on adjacent walls of the chamber with the transmit and receive anten­
nas mounted on the remaining two walls of the chamber. The vanes are rotated 
at speeds of 90 rpm (revolutions per minute) and 120 rpm, respectively. The 
differing speeds of rotation generate a random field inside the chamber. The 
chamber size for this particular experimental setup is 2m × 2m × 2m with the 
DUT mounted on a fixed pedestal in the center of the chamber. The frequency 
range for this size of chamber is above 1 GHz.
The transmit and receive antennas are broadband log-periodic antennas 
for the frequency range of 1 GHz to 10 GHz. An example of the site attenua­
tion as a function of frequency is shown in Figure 2.31, the mean value being 
calculated in units of dB. The rate of collection of data points is 10 per minute. 
The measurement method generally has an acceptable error of around a few dB. 
The advantage of the reverberating system is the short time required to perform 
the measurement. The disadvantage, however, is an increase in the measure­
ment error to a few dB.
2.5.3  Random Field Measurement
Random field measurement has already been presented in Section 2.3.4 as an 
outdoor measurement method for antenna gain. It is now being presented as an 
indoor EMI measurement method. The radiation pattern of a mobile handheld 
terminal can be seriously distorted from the ideal one by the presence of the 
chasis and the operator’s hand, head, and body. To counteract these effects, the 
radiated power from the terminal should be randomly scattered by obstacles;

this would be experienced when operated in a real environment. In an outdoor 
environment, this test method requires only a suitable transmitter and receiver 
system and an appropriate site for testing. However, the uncertainty of weather 
conditions from day to day and the need to obtain a testing license for the use 
of a high-powered transmitter outdoors makes outdoor testing of the mobile 
terminal troublesome. To overcome these obstacles, a random field measure­
ment system has been developed for indoor usage. The indoor testing method is 
also good as a first test of the DUT before moving on to the final outdoor test.
The measurement system is placed inside a shielded room and consists 
of a series of scatters which surround the antenna under test, and the receiving 
antenna which is mounted on a rotating pedestal (see Figure 2.32) [32]. The 
electromagnetic wave scatter obstacles are made from an aluminum covered 
cardboard strip bent into a parabolic-like cross section. The strip length is a 
quarter wavelength at measurement frequency. The receiving antenna is rotated 
simultaneously in two directions—in the horizontal plane by the inverted L-
shaped rotor arm mounted on the pedestal and in the vertical plane by a smaller 
rotor arm mounted perpendicularly to the first rotor arm. The measurement 
procedure is the same as the one described in Section 2.3.4. In the first step, a 
standard half wavelength dipole antenna of known gain characteristic is con­
nected to the transmitter and mounted on the fixed pedestal (shown on the 
right hand side of Figure 2.32). Using this setup, the median value of the re­
ceived level Ms is measured by rotating the receiving antenna (shown on the 
left hand side of Figure 2.32). Next, the same measurement is performed on the 
mobile terminal and the medium value Mt is obtained. The radiated power Pt 
from the terminal under test can thus be obtained using the relation:

where Po is the transmitter output power. If the measurement is performed with 
the operator holding the test terminal, the measured radiation power includes 
the power loss in the body tissue.
In situations where test space is even more severely restricted, a measure­
ment system using a compact shield box may be used [33]. Figure 2.33 shows 
the measurement setup. In this measurement system, a random electromagnetic 
field distribution is generated inside the box by means of the reflections off 
the inner box walls. The handheld terminal is mounted on a rotating pedestal 
offset from the rotation axis in order to reduce the effects of the terminal an­
tenna directivity on the measurement. The size of the shield box is only 50 cm 
× 50 cm × 100 cm, roughly 1/30 the size of chambers used in other methods.

Its operating frequency is above 1 GHz. The upper limit of the operating fre­
quency depends on the frequency band of the receiving antenna. The receiving 
antenna is a standard half wavelength dipole antenna mounted with the ele­
ment tilted at a 45 degree angle to the vertical. The DUT is also mounted at a 
45 degree angle on the rotating pedestal.
The tilt angle is used to suppress the direct path signal from the transmit­
ter to the receiver. The measurement error for this method can be less than 1 dB 
and a measurement time of only a few minutes which allows data acquisition of 
thousands of data points at each frequency.
2.6  Product Testing
Antenna performance measurement procedures are described in this final sec­
tion of the chapter. In the final development stages of a mobile terminal, several 
tests are carried out to check the terminal performance under practical operat­
ing conditions. This section details examples of testing procedures for the fi­
nal development and mass production stages of mobile handset terminals. The 
testing procedures may be categorized into electrical tests and mechanical tests. 
Mechanical testing of the handset is not directly relevant to electrical engineers, 
but it is an important factor in the design of the handset. In this discussion, 
only digital system mobile terminal handsets are considered. At this stage of the 
handset development, the prototype handset has already been fabricated and 
tested, and the final assembly of the antenna device is the main consideration. 
Important evaluation tests required for the development of the prototype hand­
set antenna have been dealt with in the preceding sections. Similar evaluation 
test procedures for base station antennas are presented in Chapter 4.
2.6.1  Electrical Testing at the Development Stage
2.6.1.1  The Equivalent Radiated Power (ERP) Measurement (Transmission Test)
The radiated power level and the radiation pattern from the radio frequency 
(RF) transmitter of the mobile handset are measured in an RF anechoic cham­
ber. The radiation pattern for the handset is measured both with the antenna 
extended from the handset casing and also when the antenna is retracted within 
the casing. The frequency measurement is made at the center of the operating 
frequency bandwidth of the device and at the upper and lower frequency limits. 
The acceptable voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) level for the system deter­
mines the upper and lower frequency limits. To ensure that the test data is as 
realistic as possible, a prototype handset is used for the test measurement. The 
prototype handset is set to radiate a RF burst signal continuously during the 
test. The radiation pattern from the device is then measured in the usual man-

80 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
ner. The pattern is also measured for the handset with a phantom instead of a 
human operator. Categorization of phantoms is covered in Chapter 3.
2.6.1.2  The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) Measurement (Reception 
Test)
The prototype handset undergoing testing is placed inside an anechoic cham­
ber together with a base station emulator attached to a transmit antenna of 
known gain. For digital cellular communications systems, the handset acts as 
a terminal to report the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) level of the 
communications uplink in an ideal operating environment. The RSSI pattern 
for the system can then be measured as a function of the elevation and azimuth 
angles. The pattern averaging procedure that allows the handset antenna gain to 
be evaluated is described in Chapter 3.
2.6.1.3  Ratio Testing of the Communication Data Link
The prototype handset is tested in a situation in which it is immersed in a weak 
base station transmit signal field, in an outdoor environment. The number of 
successful connections to the base station is then logged against the actual num­
ber of calls made. This ratio then gives a rough figure for the percentage of suc­
cessful connections that can be expected for the system under a specific set of 
operating conditions. This is one of the final tests made in the development of 
mobile communications terminals. If the ratio is below the target ratio expected 
for the system, it may be possible to trace the problem to a number of areas in 
the mobile terminal design (e.g., faulty antenna design, bad control software 
design, or too large an internal noise source from a specific component used in 
the internal circuit design).
2.6.2  Electrical Tests in the Mass Production Process
Testing of the mobile handset during the mass production process is as equally 
important as the many tests performed during the development stages of the 
product. It is also a key factor in monitoring the quality control level of the 
final product. At this stage, the transmission power level can only be checked 
in a very simple fashion. This criterion is set to satisfy the relevant regulations.
2.6.3  Mechanical Testing in the Development Phase
The purpose of mechanical testing of the mobile terminal antenna is to allow 
the manufacturer to ensure product durability.Again, the criterion for passing 
the tests is whether or not the transmission power increases above a level speci­
fied by the manufacturer.These are the only mechanical tests required for the 
antenna in the final development phase and they are illustrated in Figure 2.34.

2.6.3.1  The Extraction Test 
For the extraction test, the whip antenna is pulled in and out of the casing tens 
of thousands of times. After this test is completed, the electrical characteristics 
of the antenna are remeasured to verify whether or not the antenna is operating 
within the range of acceptance.
2.6.3.2  The Bending Test 
For this test the whip antenna is bent until the tip touches the chassis of the 
handset. The whip antenna should have sufficient flexibility that it does not 
break during this test and should also spring back to its original shape.
2.6.3.3  Load Test for the Retracted Antenna
With the antenna retracted into the handset casing, a force is applied to the tip 
perpendicular to the antenna. After the test has been performed, the antenna 
performance is rechecked.

2.6.3.4  The Fall Test
As a final test, the handset terminal is dropped from a height of around 1.5m 
and checked to see whether or not it has been broken. This height is roughly 
the same height at which the operator uses the handset. This test completes the 
mechanical tests required for a whip antenna used on mobile phone terminals.

Handset Antennas and Influences due to 
the Human Body
In real-world operating conditions, the characteristics of a handset antenna can 
be influenced by many components used in the handset. Also, due to the fact 
that recent handsets are becoming more compact, it has now become necessary 
to take into account the influence of the handset chassis. Built-in antennas are 
one of the most common types of antenna used in handset terminals. However, 
such antennas are strongly influenced by the handset terminal chassis and also 
by the user’s hand and head when operating the terminal. These influences 
must be taken into account during the design stage of the handset antenna.
This chapter is devoted to the discussion of the techniques used to evalu­
ate such influences. It is possible to use a special type of mannequin, called a 
phantom, to evaluate the influence of the human body on the antenna charac­
teristics. Measurements using a phantom are described and measured data are 
compared with those using human operators.
3.1  The Effects of Chassis on the Handset Antenna
The purpose of these antenna measurements is to extract data that will help 
counteract the effects of the chassis and the human body on the antenna oper­
ating characteristics during the design stage. Even if the antenna characteristics 
are proven to be fully satisfactory when the antenna is attached to the terminal 
chassis, if an actual operator uses the handset the antenna, characteristics can 
still be greatly altered by an actual operator. It is, therefore, vital for the final 
antenna design that the influences of the human body on the antenna charac­
teristics are fully investigated.

86 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
A dielectric material, which is electrically equivalent to human body tis­
sue, is used to design a mannequin called a phantom for these evaluation tests. 
Alternatively, an actual person can be used for the measurements. This chapter 
first explains the effect of the chassis on the antenna performance. Details of 
different types of phantom are described in Section 3.2.
3.1.1  Relationship Between Antenna Type and the Chassis Size
A monopole antenna is a typical example of handset antenna to discuss the chas­
sis size. Various shaped built-in monopole antennas are used in mobile handset 
and their operating principles are explained by the simple monopole antenna. 
For simplicity, this section discusses the input impedance and radiation pattern 
of the monopole antenna. If a quarter wavelength monopole antenna is placed 
on an infinite ground plane, then the total antenna length can be regarded as 
half wavelength due to the image current induced on the ground plane. How­
ever, because an infinite ground plane does not exist in reality, the antenna must 
be installed on a finite ground plane. As explained in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.4, 
the input impedance and radiation pattern of the antenna are influenced by the 
size of the ground plane. Because the handset chassis acts as the ground plane 
for most monopole antennas on mobile terminals, the antenna characteristics 
can be strongly affected by the casing size.
As shown in Figure 3.1, the chassis may be approximated by a metal board 
of height H and width W. The monopole antenna may be approximated by a 
wire model of length h, as shown in Figure 3.1. The method of moments may 
be used to calculate the radiation pattern from this model in the z-x plane [1]. 
Current flowing on the outside of the casing causes undesirable pattern lobes 
from the handset. If the casing height L is larger than the length of the mono­

pole antenna h, then a large side lobe will appear in the z-x plane cut of the 
radiation pattern, as shown in Figure 3.2(a).

Handset terminals for digital TV reception often use monopole antennas of 
approximately half wavelength in length. This is done in order to increase the an­
tenna gain. The actual length of the monopole antenna is 3/8λ or 5/8λ, so as to take 
into account the impedance matching considerations at the antenna feed point. 
For sleeve antennas (unlike monopole antennas), a ground plane is not required 
to achieve resonance. However, side lobes would appear on the radiation pattern 
when the length of the casing becomes greater than the antenna length, as shown in 
Figure 3.2(b). This is also due to the current flow on the chassis surface. 
By making a notch on the casing, it is possible to partially suppress the cur­
rent flow on the casing [2]. In order to further suppress the undesirable radiation 
lobes, the chassis may be completely separated into two parts with two separate 
parts connected by a conducting wire, as shown in Figure 3.3. The resulting radia­
tion pattern for this shape of handset is shown in Figure 3.4. Although the side 
lobes cannot be completely removed using this technique, handset type shown in 
Figure 3.3(b) does give a better side lobe suppression than handset type shown in 
Figure 3.3(a). If the handset is divided into two isolated sections (with no conduct­
ing wire), then the side lobes in the radiation pattern completely vanish. If a chassis 
length L is larger than the quarter wavelength, then a large side lobe will appear. 
When discussing antenna length, it is important to remember that the length refers 
to the electrical length of the antenna. The use of a helical structure, or inductive 
loading, can shorten the physical length of an antenna for mobile terminal applica­
tions. Its resonance properties are then equivalent to those of a monopole antenna 
or a sleeve antenna, where their electrical lengths are defined as λ/4 or λ/2, respec­
tively. When using physically shortened antennas, the chassis electrical length must 
be less than the quarter length.

3.1.2  Relationship Between Average Antenna Gain and Chassis Size
As shown in Section 3.1.1, the radiation pattern of a handset antenna depends 
greatly on the relative length of the antenna with respect to that of the chassis. 
Therefore, it is necessary to make some quantitative estimation of how much 
radiation pattern distortion will occur if the casing size is changed. The chassis 
width does not change the radiation pattern if the width is less than the cas­
ing length, whereas a wide casing increases the frequency bandwidth just like a 
thick wire antenna. Accordingly, chassis size in this section refers to the length 
only.
An additional consideration is the slant angle of the handset relative to the 
operator’s head during actual use. This section shows the influence of the slant 
angle on the antenna gain and also discusses the influence of the head and the 
hand on the antenna performance.
Because electromagnetic waves are scattered by many obstacles when trav­
elling from the base station to the reception point, in modern mobile com­
munication systems it can be assumed that the waves will approach the handset 
from all directions. As was shown in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.1, the waves arriv­
ing at the receiving point can be considered to be concentrated in a horizontal 
plane. The received electric field strength Er is calculated by multiplying the 
radiation pattern in the horizontal plane of the terminal by the uniformly ar­
riving electric field distribution from the base station. This is then defined as 
an average received electric field strength. This average received electric field is 
referred to as the mean effective antenna gain (MEG) when considered from 
Figure 3.4  Chassis size and radiation pattern of sleeve antenna.

where the θ′ is the angle from the z′ axis and α are the inclination angle of the 
handset from the x axis, as defined in Figure 3.5. The vertical polarization electric 
field strength is divided by the horizontal polarization electric field strength (XPR); 
XPR becomes the cross polarization ratio. The angle θ′ is given in terms of the Eθ 
and Eφ electric field components, but can be neglected for most handset terminals. 
In the handset coordinate system shown in Figure 3.5(a), φ and θ′ satisfy the fol­
lowing equation:

Figure 3.6 shows an example of the average received electric field strength 
has a function of the angle of inclination, using the handset radiation pattern 
shown in Figure 3.2(a). The data set S, M and L represent small, medium, and 
large casing sizes, respectively.
Although the difference between the chassis sizes is hardly noticeable when 
the inclination angle is less than 10°, the antenna gain of even the smallest chassis 
is large when an inclination angle is greater than 10°. It can be concluded from 
these results that it is desirable to increase the effective gain of the antenna so that 
side lobes do not appear in the radiation pattern.
3.1.3  Current Flow Measurement on the Handset Chassis
Once the antenna is installed into the handset chassis, simulation or measure­
ment is required to find the current flow on the chassis surface. Because it is 
difficult to include all the electronic components that make up the handset in 
the simulation model, it is better to measure the current flow on the chassis. It 
can, however, be estimated indirectly from the measured radiation pattern of 
the antenna with the chassis. For example, unwanted sidelobes appear when an­
other strong current is flowing on the chassis in addition to the antenna current.
For radiation pattern measurement, the influence of the feed cables 
should be minimized. The current flowing on the cable is suppressed to a low 
level by covering it with ferrite beads or by using a balun. Alternatively, the feed 
cable may be removed using a built-in miniature transmitter in the terminal.

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
For the measurement method using optical fiber, the metal cable connected to 
the antenna is replaced by optical fiber and the cable effects can be greatly re­
duced. With a miniaturized optical/electrical (O/E) converter connected to the 
antenna, accurate measurement results can be obtained [3]. The S-parameter 
method (as shown in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.3) can also eliminate cable effects 
with off-line processing.
To measure the current distribution directly, a small loop antenna can be 
used as a magnetic flux detector to locate which part of the casing the current is 
concentrated on. The magnetic flux density Bz can be considered to be almost 
uniform inside the loop if the loop diameter is very small. The coordinate sys­
tem of the loop is shown in Figure 3.7.

across the gap in the loop is given by:

where Φ denotes the magnetic flux inside the loop, N is the number of loop 
turns and a the loop radius. A small loop antenna is suitable to be used as a 
probe for magnetic field detection because the induced voltage is proportional 
to the magnetic flux through the loop. The relationship between the magnetic 
field and the current flowing on the handset chassis can be found using Am­
pere’s law as shown in Figure 3.7.
The current flowing on the chassis can be measured by scanning a small 
loop in the vicinity of the chassis as shown in Figure 3.8.

3.2 
The Phantom—An Electrical Equivalent Model of the Human Body
Although the influence of the handset chassis on the antenna operating charac­
teristics is a major problem, the primary problem to overcome is the influence 
of the human body on the antenna. Because a handset in used is in close prox­
imity to the head and body, it is strongly affected by these parts of the human 
body. Thus, for practical handset antenna designs it is required to take into ac­
count the influences of the human body. It is therefore necessary to account for 
such influences on the antenna as much as possible. Moreover, even under the 
influence of the human body, the antenna should still operate within specified 
limits dictated by the system designer. The design of a handset antenna should 
also be such that the human body (specifically, the head) is irradiated as little 
as possible. A medical technique that utilizes microwave radiation, called dia­
thermy, is often used in the treatment of several different kinds of disease. This 
type of medical treatment was uncovered not long after the discovery of elec­
tromagnetic waves. However, because there was no theoretical basis to analyze 
such effect in the early 1910’s, only the negative influences of electromagnetic 
waves on the human body were more commonly known.
When it was realized that electromagnetic waves can heat up human body 
tissues by a few degrees, a safety standard was introduced to indicate an ac­
ceptable level of exposure of the human body to electromagnetic waves. The 
original safety standard defined the safe level of irradiation of the surface of 
the human body as 10 mW/cm2 [4]; this was later lowered to 1 mW/cm2 [5]. 
One application of such heating effect is in the treatment of cancer. It is known 
that cancer cells have a lower resistance to heat than normal body cells, thus ir­
radiating both the cancer and normal cells with electromagnetic radiation can 
destroy the cancer cells without harming the normal cells. This type of medical

treatment is referred to as hypothermia therapy. However, the purpose of this 
chapter is not to discuss the influence of electromagnetic waves on the human 
body, but to evaluate whether or not the level of electromagnetic radiation radi­
ated by the portable handset terminal satisfies the national safety standard.
With the cooperation of a volunteer, it is possible to measure the influence 
of electromagnetic radiation from the handset on the human body. One prob­
lem in performing such an experiment is that the volunteer must maintain the 
same posture, as if the handset would be in actual use for long period of time. 
Another problem is that the volunteer may be over exposed to electromagnetic 
radiation. There can also be considerable difference between individuals, thus 
making it difficult to achieve data repeatability.
The gain of a handset antenna was evaluated using the random field mea­
surement method for 30 different test subjects and has been reported as having 
a mean value of 12 dB with no user influence and 6 dB when being used by an 
operator [6]. In order to obtain test data repeatability, the influence of the hu­
man body on the antenna may be evaluated using a special kind of mannequin 
called a phantom. In addition, the composition of the dielectric materials that 
make up the phantom (or the human body) may be entered into a computer in 
order to simulate the experimental test setup. The specifications of phantoms 
for numerical simulation and experimental usage are described in detail in the 
following sections.
3.2.1  Phantoms Used in Numerical Simulations
For mobile telephone development, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of 
the human head on the handset radiation characteristics. A European work 
group called Cooperation in the field of Scientific and Technical Research 244 
(COST244) has proposed two simplified models of the head for numerical 
evaluation purposes [7]. One model is a cube with a side length of 20 cm, 
and the other is a sphere of radius of 10 cm. Both the cube and the sphere 
are modeled on the basis that they are composed of a homogeneous dielectric 
material. An example of typically assumed material constants is given in Table 
3.1. In order to model the skin, an outer shell of dielectric material of thick­
ness 5 mm, with a dielectric constant of 3 (εr = 3), is added. A similar phantom 
described by the COST244 work group was also adopted in the United States

by the IEEE Standards Coordinating Committees (SCC 34), which describes 
safety standards for irradiation by electromagnetic radiation. There is, however, 
a slight difference in the assumed material constants, as shown in Table 3.1. 
Such a simple form of a phantom is useful as a standard to check the validity 
of computation codes and measurement setups. Because the composition of a 
human body is extremely complex, a phantom model that imitates the structure 
of the body (e.g., the head) is generally used in initial stages of computation.
3.2.2  Calculation Methods for Phantom and Handset Antenna Models
The Method of Moments and the Finite Difference and Time Domain (FDTD) 
method are typical numerical methods for the evaluation of such problems. An­
alytical results are available for models such as the layered spherical phantom, 
because Green’s function can be derived for such case [7, 8]. Green’s function is 
used for an electromagnetic field excited by a unit source vector under the given 
boundary conditions of the problem. It is analogous to the transfer function in 
system analysis. Once Green’s function is derived, the electromagnetic fields are 
calculated for an arbitrary distributed source using that function. Green’s func­
tion used in electromagnetic problems is analogous to the transfer function in 
system analysis.
An example of a sphere utilizing the layered structure model is shown in 
[9]. Figure 3.9 shows the model to be analyzed, and the corresponding param­
eters are given in Table 3.2. Using the layered-sphere model, it is thus possible 
to compute the absorption of the electromagnetic wave in a thin layer such as 
the skin. Table 3.2 shows the assumed material characteristics of the various 
layers in the human head model. 
Using the FDTD method, it is possible to divide an object into very small 
volumes, or cells. Once the real object is divided into cells, the characteristics

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
of the model may be calculated numerically, thereby giving a close approxima­
tion to the actual characteristics. For precise modeling, large computational 
resources are required to create the necessary small sized cells, which then allow 
for the modeling of the handset structure and the operator’s hand. Figure 3.10 
shows an example of a phantom head model for numerical simulation purposes; 
the phantom used in numerical simulations is based on the anatomy chart of 
an actual human body [10]. A phantom with millimeter resolution accuracy 
can be made automatically from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 
a human body [11,–13]. The phantom used for numerical simulations must 
be specifically tailored to the purpose of the calculations. Once a phantom for 
the simulation is prepared, it is helpful to cross-reference the phantom cross-
sectional composition with the data recorded on the websites for the Visible 
Human Project [14] and the United States Federal Communications Com­
mission (FCC). Both websites contain data on the electrical characteristics of 
human body tissues versus frequency [15].
3.2.3  Phantoms for Use in Experimental Measurements
To evaluate the characteristics of a mobile handset operating near the human 
body, as well as to confirm the validity of simulation models, experimental 
measurements using a physical model of a phantom are also required. Because 
cost and/or complexity preclude the construction of a phantom that is an ex­
act replica of the human body, a phantom composed of two different kinds 
of homogeneous dielectric material is normally used. A plastic skin of several 
millimeters thick, called the shell, is used to maintain the physical form of the 
phantom by enclosing a liquid.
There are two main classifications of phantoms for experimental use: (1) 
a dry phantom that is made of a hard ceramic material, and (2) a wet phantom 
that consists of a water solution or a jelly-like substance that has been molded 
into the desired shape. One problem is that the dry phantom tends to be very

heavy, although the hard material acts as a realistic imitation of the head, hand, 
and torso (the upper half of the body). The wet phantom, however, offers the 
advantage that additives can be used to change the material characteristics of 
the phantom. In addition, when performing electromagnetic wave irradiation 
experiments, an optional cut can be made through the body of the phantom to 
observe an arbitrary cut plane in the measurements; this is advantageous.
On the other hand, a major disadvantage of wet phantoms when com­
pared with dry phantoms is that, due to the type of material used in wet phan­
toms, it is difficult to preserve them for more than a month. 
3.2.3.1  The Dry Phantom
The human body consists of both low water content structures (such as the skin, 
fat, and bone), and high water content structures (such as the brain, muscles, 
and internal organs). However, the electrical characteristics of the tissues vary 
greatly at frequencies of 10 MHz and less [16]. For the mobile communications 
operating frequency band of 800 MHz to 2 GHz, the dielectric-loss tangent is 
found to range from 0.1 to 3.0, and the dielectric constant from 20 to 70 [17]. 
For materials used in the construction of phantoms, it is not easy to obtain 
a material with a loss tangent (tan δ) between 1 and 10. Ceramic materials, 
however, can be used to give a dielectric constant (εr) between 10 and several 
10,000s in the microwave frequency band. A phantom with a loss tangent simi­
lar to that of the human body can be made by adding conducting powder to the 
ceramic [18]. The composition of the plastic shell used to form the phantom 
shape is barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), stannum (Sn), and carbon 
powder, which then mimics the electrical characteristics of a living body. The 
electrical characteristics of the plastic and oxide powder are εr = 3.1, tan = 0.1 
at 1MHz and εr = 20, tanδ = 0.02 at 1MHz, respectively. The dry phantom 
shown in Figure 3.11 is proven to be particularly useful when the influence of 
the hand on the radiation characteristics of the handset have to be considered.

3.2.3.2  The Wet Phantom
For the examination of electromagnetic irradiation effects on the human body, 
it is important to measure the temperature rise distribution inside the phantom; 
a dry phantom must therefore be cut into sections during the production pro­
cess. The wet phantom is convenient because an optional cut along one side is 
possible for making such measurements, as shown in Figure 3.12. For perform­
ing hyperthermia therapy experiments, it is also possible to place the radiation 
applicator inside of the wet phantom at a location of the users’ choice. In the 
construction of wet phantoms, a salt solution and agar have been the choice for 
phantoms used in the microwave frequency band [19]. The loss tangent may 
be controlled by use of the electrolyte sodium chloride (NaCl), although the 
control of the dielectric constant was proven to be difficult. Because the mate­
rial from which a wet phantom is made is equivalent to biological material, it 
can also decompose over time; this is considered disadvantageous. For experi­

mental use, it is ideal to have wet phantoms that can be preserved for long pe­
riods of time while having suitable material characteristics. Such a phantom has 
been reported in [20]. If the food preservative Dehydroacetic Acid Sodium Salt 
(DASS) is added to the phantom material, preservation period of one month 
or more may be possible at normal temperature. The phantom should also be 
covered by a thin film for further protection. 
The electrical characteristics of muscle tissues may also be imitated in 
the frequency range from 200 MHz to 2.5 GHz. The types of material used in 
a wet phantom are shown in Table 3.3. In the 900 MHz frequency band, the 
dielectric constant may be controlled (35–65) using polyethylene powder, and 
the conductivity by introducing small quantities of NaCl (0.3–2.5). Figure 3.13 
gives an example of the actual material composition data for a wet phantom.
3.2.3.3  Whole Body Phantoms
In the 900 MHz operating band and higher, the hand and the head are the 
dominant influences on mobile telephone radiation characteristics. For low-fre­
quency bands, such as the 150 MHz band, which is used for multiple channel 
access (MCA) services, a whole body phantom is required. This is because the 
wavelength of the radiation is considerably longer than that at the microwave 
frequencies, and resonance effects are observed across the entire length of the 
human body. VHF band pagers are also used in close proximity to the human 
body; therefore, it is also necessary to evaluate the influence of the human body 
on the operating characteristics of a pager. 
A dry whole body phantom may be made with ceramics only, whereas a wet 
whole body phantom is made by filling a plastic mannequin with a salt solution 
and using a double cylinder made of vinyl chloride containing material that is 
electrically equivalent to that of human muscle tissue. An example of such a whole 
body phantom is shown in Figure 3.14 [17]. There is also a homogeneous phantom

3.3  Antenna Measurements with Human Test Subjects and 
Phantoms
This section presents measurement examples for evaluating the characteristics 
of a mobile handset antenna in close proximity to human test subjects. Actual 
measured data of the antenna input and radiation characteristics are presented 
using a standard dipole antenna. The measurement results are also compared 
with those obtained using a dry phantom shaped like the upper half of the hu­
man body.
The close proximity of the human body to a handset antenna can change 
the input impedance characteristics and can also distort the radiation pattern 
of the antenna. The influences of the hand and the head on the antenna can be 
measured by fixing the antenna and handset to the hand of the dry phantom 
and introducing a coaxial feeder cable between the antenna feed point and the 
measurement equipment. As mentioned in Chapter 2, while performing the 
measurements, the position of the antenna (and cable) relative to the phan­
tom should not be changed. A material, such as styrene foam, with a dielectric 
constant close to 1 (almost equivalent to air) is used to hold the antenna under 
test in position. Figure 3.15 shows the antenna measurement setup using a dry 
phantom.
For the antenna input impedance measurement, if the distance L between 
the feed point and the phantom surface is greater than a wavelength (L > λ), the 
measured results are unaffected by the presence of the phantom. Because the 
phantom acts as an obstacle that disturbs the radiation field from the antenna, 
the radiation pattern toward the phantom side will be changed.
Measurement examples are presented in Section 3.3. By measuring the 
radiation efficiency of the antenna while it is in close proximity to the phan­
tom, the extent to which power is absorbed by phantom can be evaluated. As 
described in Chapter 2, for radiation efficiency measurement, by necessity, the

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
measurement system becomes very large and the measurement procedure is 
time-consuming.
For a relative measurement, the random field method is a well-known 
technique. This method was also explained in Chapter 2. Normally, for the 
random field measurement, a human test subject is used to hold the terminal 
while the measurement is performed. However, the measurement error can be 
reduced by the use of a phantom. The mean effective gain (MEG) of the radia­
tion pattern is measured inside of a RF anechoic chamber and is used to evalu­
ate the relative efficiency. In a real-world operating environment for a mobile 
communication systems, an approximate antenna gain is calculated using the 
MEG in the horizontal plane, as defined in (3.1). This is due to the fact that 
the signal arriving at the mobile terminal is coming from a point far away, and 
the RF waves are thus concentrated in the horizontal plane. The relative gain of 
the antenna Gt is evaluated by taking the difference between the mean received 
field strength Es, measured with a standard half wavelength dipole antenna of 
gain Gs, and the measured value of the received field strength Et taken with the 
antenna under test.

3.3.1  Measurements of Antenna Characteristics in the Presence of Human 
Body
The voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) and radiation characteristics of a di­
pole antenna with 28 human test subjects were measured in an anechoic cham­
ber to find their average characteristics [22]. The measurement setup is shown 
in Figure 3.16. A male human test subject sat on a horizontal-plane azimuth 
positioner and a λ/2-dipole antenna was attached to his ear with a formed poly­
styrene spacer. The subject’s upper body dimensions are given as shown in Fig­
ure 3.17, and the average and variation of dimensions of the subject’s upper 
body dimensions are listed in Table 3.4. The spacer is held by the subject’s own

hand not to disturb the antenna operation. Figure 3.18 shows the subject’s hand 
dimensions. The average and variation of hand dimensions are listed in Table 
3.5.
The VSWR of the antenna in the presence of human body is shown in 
Figure 3.19 for 28 test subjects. We can see that the antenna resonant frequency 
shifted to the low-frequency-side by 4% in the 900 MHz band, and by 6% in 
the 1900 MHz band. The frequency shift due to the human body is increased 
in the high frequency band. The radiation patterns from the antenna in the 
horizontal plane are shown in Figures 3.20 and 3.21. Measurements were made 
at a frequency of 940 MHz and 1900 MHz. The pattern of a vertically-oriented 
antenna is omnidirectional in the horizontal plane when the antenna is in free

space. We can see from Figure 3.20(a) and 3.21(a) that the radiation pattern 
of a vertically-oriented antenna on the phantom side (180 ≤ θ ≤ 360º) is sup­
pressed by 10 dB at 940 MHz and 15 dB at 1900 MHz, respectively. The radia­
tion toward the body becomes smaller in the higher frequency band because the 
electrical size of body at 1900 MHz is two times larger than that at 940 MHz. 
The null direction of the antenna in free-space is tilted by about 30° at 
900 MHz, shown in Figure 3.20(b), and is not easy to identify at 1900 MHz 
due to severe pattern distortion, shown in Figure 3.21(b). This is caused by the 
larger electrical size in the higher frequency band and the presence of a creeping 
wave. The creeping wave is excited at around θ = 90º, and propagates along the 
phantom surface and then radiates in the backward direction. Two main paths 
of the creeping wave are along the upper and the bottom surfaces. The path 
length difference for the two waves is changed by the shape of head, and hence 
is the null direction. 
3.3.2  Measurement Examples Using a Sphere-Shaped Wet Phantom
Examples of measurements using a spherical wet phantom of 10 cm radius and 
with a dielectric constant of εr = 52 + j19 are shown in this section. The param­
eters to be fixed during the measurement procedure are: (1) the direction of the 
antenna towards the phantom, and (2) the distance between the phantom and 
the antenna.
For the measurements, a standard dipole antenna was used and two spe­
cific measurements were made: (1) the position of the maximum radiation from 
the antenna towards the phantom and (2) the position of the null in the ra­
diation pattern, as shown in Figure 3.22. The measurements were made at a 
frequency of 2.5 GHz. The radiation patterns from the antenna in the E- and 
H-planes are shown in Figure 3.23(a) and (b), respectively. The pattern for the 
E-plane of Figure 3.23(b) is also shown in Figure 3.24, because this antenna 
position is axial symmetrical about the antenna. The H-plane pattern is omni­
directional for all the parameters. 
It is clearly seen that the radiation pattern on the phantom side (180 ≤ θ 
≤ 360º) is suppressed in Figure 3.23. The radiation strength towards the phan­
tom becomes smaller because the input impedance characteristic of the antenna

The radiation pattern on the phantom side is caused by a creeping wave. 
The creeping wave is excited at around θ = 90º, and propagates along the phan­
tom surface and then radiates backwards. 
The return loss characteristic of the antenna is also shown in Figure 3.25, 
for varying distance between the antenna and the phantom, and also for both 
antenna orientations towards the phantom. The antenna resonant frequency 
decreases, and the matching condition at the feed point deteriorates when the 
antenna is in close proximity to the phantom, except for the curve for d =1 cm 
in Figure 3.22(a). The resonant frequency for d = 0 in Figure 3.22(a) (i.e., with 
the antenna feed point attached to the phantom) shifted to the high frequency 
side. In this case, part of the antenna current flows to the phantom and results 
in a different tendency with respect to the other parameters.

antenna toward the phantom and (b) the null in the radiation pattern.

If the antenna distance from the phantom is greater than 1 wavelength 
for the orientation shown in Figure 3.22(a), then the return loss characteristic 
is the same as when there is no phantom present. For an antenna orientation as 
shown in Figure 3.22(b), the influence of the phantom may be neglected if the 
antenna is at a distance greater than a quarter wavelength.

3.3.3  Measurement Examples Using an Upper Body Model Dry Phantom
This section presents a measurement example using a dry phantom shaped 
like the upper half of the human body. Figure 3.26 shows the experimental 
setup used to examine the horizontal and vertical antenna orientations. An 
electromagnetic-equivalent phantom, an ultra-light carbon phantom (ULCP), 
is shown in Figure3.27. The ULCP consists of a head and upper body without 
hands and arms. The shell of the ULCP is made of a low-dielectric resin. An 
electromagnetic wave-absorbing sheet is placed on the inside of the shell; the 
ULCP itself is empty [23]. Although the weight of the head and upper body of 
the specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) phantoms is greater than 20 
kg, that of the ULCP is 3.6 kg [24]. Therefore, the ULCP can be easily installed 
on a simple 3D rotary positioner with azimuth and roll axes when using the 
great circle cut measurement system.
As with the previous experiment, the radiation pattern from vertically- 
and horizontally-oriented dipole antennas are measured at 940 MHz and 1900 
MHz, respectively. The radiation patterns from the antenna in the presence of 
typical human body are also presented. This measurement has almost the same 
average radiation pattern as the one seen in Section 3.2.1. As shown in Figures 
3.28(a) and (b), the radiation patterns using the phantom well agreed with the 
patterns in the presence of human body. The pattern suppression toward the 
phantom is agreed for the vertically-oriented antenna, and the number of nulls 
is the same for both orientations at each frequency.

The presence of the user hand also changes the radiation performance of mobile 
terminals, and the hand has greater influence on antenna radiation performance 
than the head [25]. Therefore, a hand phantom needs to be included in the 
evaluation of the RF performance of a mobile terminal. In this section, the RF

performance of a dipole antenna and a mobile terminal with a ULCP hand are 
presented in comparison with several human test subjects.
The VSWR and radiation performance of a dipole antenna with the ULCP 
hand and three human test subjects were measured in an anechoic chamber. 
The measurement system is shown in Figure 3.29. In order to measure perfor­
mance influenced by only the hand of the human test subjects, each subject was 
placed in a cylindrical box made with an electromagnetic wave absorbing sheet. 
The box and ULCP or one of the human test subjects sat on a horizontal-plane 
azimuth positioner, and a λ/2-dipole antenna was attached to a resin pole on 
the box. Polystyrene foam was attached to the λ/2-dipole antenna as a spacer. To 
ensure clear evaluations, the human test subject stuck his fingers outside of the 
box and, keeping his fingers together, and positioned his hand to align with the 
position of the knuckle of the middle finger to that of the center of the antenna. 
The VSWR performance of the antenna with the hands in the 800 MHz 
and 2 GHz bands are shown in Figure 3.30(a) and (b), respectively. Compared 
to the VSWR performance without test subjects, the matching frequencies in

ULCP are virtually equivalent to those with human test subjects in these fre­
quency bands.
Measured radiation patterns in the horizontal plane are shown in Figures 
3.31 and 3.32. Each pattern is normalized by the peak of the radiation pattern 
without a test subject. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ULCP achieves 
almost the same radiation pattern as the human test subjects. All the radiation 
patterns are reduced in magnitude regardless of the direction because of the 
VSWR losses induced by the hand. The VSWR losses at 840 MHz are more 
than those at 1970 MHz because the electrical distance between the antenna 
and hand at 840 MHz is shorter. The radiated power at 1970 MHz is reduced 
in the direction shaded by the hand because of less diffraction in the higher 
frequency band.
3.4  SAR Measurement Using a Phantom
This section presents examples of the regulation standard of the specific absorp­
tion ratio (SAR) as a safety standard for electromagnetic wave irradiation of the 
human body. The detailed definition of the SAR and its measurement method 
(using a phantom) are also presented together with an example of electric field 
distribution measurement inside a spherical wet phantom.

The SAR (in W/kg) is used as a safety standard for the irradiation level of elec­
tromagnetic waves on living bodies. The SAR is a measure of the heat energy 
absorbed in unit time by a living body. There are three definitions of the SAR: 
(i) the absorption ratio by short pulse waves, (ii) the whole body average SAR,

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
The localized SAR is used mainly as the standard of irradiation level for 
portable terminals. On the other hand, an incident power level at the body sur­
face is often used for the safety standard in addition to the SAR. The standard 
example is 1 mW/cm2. The safety standards for SAR used in Japan, the United 
States and Europe are shown in Table 3.6.
3.4.2  Definition of the SAR and the Measurement Method
To evaluate the influence of electromagnetic (EM) wave irradiation on the liv­
ing body, the SAR is defined as an amount of EM energy absorption in a unit 
mass as follows:

=
	
(3.5)
where the conductivity, the effective electric field amplitude, and the material 
density are denoted by is σ (S/m), E (V/m), and ρ (kg/m3), respectively. There­
fore, the SAR at the measurement point is obtained from the internal electric 
field distribution. The phantom should be allowed to warm up for a period of 
more than 30 minutes in the measurement environment, as shown in the Fig­
ure 3.33, so that the temperature distribution inside the phantom may become

uniform. After that, the phantom is irradiated by the antenna installed in the 
neighborhood of the phantom for 10∼100 seconds. A standard dipole antenna 
is widely used in this type of measurement. The irradiation time used is the 
time required to increase the temperature of the phantom by more than 1°C. 
After irradiation, pictures are taken on observation plane of the phantom with 
thermography; this is done to give a two-dimensional distribution of tempera­
ture rise [28]. Figure 3.34 shows the measurement example using a spherical 
phantom with the electrical parameters specified COST244. In this case, the 
measurement frequency was 900 MHz. This type of measurement is called a 
split phantom method, because the observation plane of the phantom is cut in 
advance so that the temperature inside of the phantom can be measured very 
quickly after irradiation.
3.4.3  The SAR Measurement Method
Because the SAR is based on a temperature rise in unit time, the heat diffusion 
from the sample during the measurement time can be neglected. At any time, 
the SAR is defined by the specific heat capacity c(J/kgK) and the temperature 
rise ∆T(C°) at the observation point of the sample during the measurement 
time ∆t.

For the SAR measurement using this definition, the electromagnetic 
waves are generated with the antenna installed either inside or the outside the 
liquid phantom, and the temperature rise inside the liquid can be measured 
directly with a thermometer [29].

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
An internationally standardized method for measuring spatial-average 
SAR is available in [30, 31]. In these standard SAR methods, an electric field 
probe (E-probe) scans in a liquid phantom. The internal SAR can be measured 
accurately because the interior of the phantom can be scanned in three dimen­
sions using an E-probe as shown in Figure 3.35. A tested mobile handset is con­
trolled by a signal from base station simulator during the SAR measurement.
The measurement of the peak spatial-average SAR is time-consuming be­
cause the E-probe scans the phantom in three dimensions. To reduce the mea­
surement time, a method that requires only a coarse area scan and the extrapo­
lation of all volumetric data has been proposed [32]. A solid phantom with 
electrical parameters identical to those of the human body has been considered 
as an alternative to a liquid phantom [33]. A lightweight phantom comprised 
of a wave absorber is considered as an alternative to a liquid or solid phantom 
[23], and a simplified method based on the use of this lightweight phantom for 
SAR measurement has also been proposed [34].
In this simplified method, the antenna under test (AUT) is scanned above 
the phantom to obtain the electric field distribution, as shown in Figure 3.36. 
To be practically feasible, the AUT is located on a table and an E-probe is em­
bedded into a wave absorber. The wave absorber is very lightweight, and the 
E-probe is scanned with the wave absorber in two dimensions to obtain the 
2D electric field distributions [35]. The internal electric field is estimated with 
the measured 2D field and the exponential approximation. The spatial SAR

Base Station Antenna Siting and 
Measurement
This chapter starts by presenting the design procedure used for siting base sta­
tion antennas in cellular systems. The site location is based on statistical data 
of the propagation characteristics, which are summarized as a set of compact 
equations derived from these data. This is called the Okumura-Hata estimation 
method. This chapter describes this estimation method in detail, together with 
another method that is appropriate for the design of small cells. Following site 
location, the base station antenna is then designed to satisfy the specifications. 
The design procedure for a cellular system is Section 4.2.
At the development stage, the designed base station antenna characteris­
tics are evaluated by making use of prototype models. The measurement meth­
od, particularly for cellular base station antennas, is the third topic described in 
the chapter. A unique measurement for base station antennas is the high power 
test. This chapter describes the special features associated with the high power 
treatment of the antenna and its measurement method in detail. The last topic 
in the chapter is the evaluation of the performance of base station antennas. 
Tests needed before product shipping include electrical, mechanical and reli­
ability performance checks. These tests are described in detail together with 
practical examples.
4.1  Base Station Antenna Siting
The location of the base station is the most important issue for cellular system 
design. The coverage area of a cellular base station ranges from a radius of 0.5–
20 km, and is determined by the number of expected users inside the coverage 

126 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
area and the geographical features in the location. The Okumura-Hata method 
is widely used to estimate the propagation loss from a base station with a cell 
radius between 1 km and 20 km. The Okumura-Hata estimation method de­
scribed in this section has been used recently in microcellular systems with a cell 
radius below 0.5 km; these systems are employed to increase the user capacity of 
a single base station. The propagation loss estimation method is also presented 
for a cell of a similar small size. The selection of base station location is based 
on these propagation loss estimations.
4.1.1  Design of Macro Cell Siting Using the Okumura-Hata Curve
In mobile communication systems, the propagation characteristics are predict­
ed by an estimation method based on large quantities of data obtained from 
propagation loss experiments, as described in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2. Geo­
graphical features inside a range of several tens of kilometers are roughly divided 
into three different areas described below, and the propagation loss is estimated 
for each type. This technique is well known as Okumura’s curve. The variation of 
the propagation loss evaluated from measurement data at 150 MHz, 450 MHz, 
900 MHz, and 1500 MHz defines the original Okumura curve. This section 
explains how this method can be used to estimate the propagation loss, as de­
scribed in Chapter 1, Section 1.1 [1]. 
Geographical features may be divided roughly into irregular and semiflat 
areas. Irregular features are classified as hills, isolated mountains, and other in­
clined geographical features. Land mobile communication services are however 
mainly used in locations with semiflat geographical features. Within semiflat 
geographical features, an undulating plain is defined as having heights less than 
20 m. Local geographical features and buildings are described by a compensa­
tion value based on a location where the undulations are small. Such semiflat 
geographical features are classified as being in the city, in the suburbs, and in 
open areas. An interpretation for a city area, where the buildings have more 
than two stories, is that the proportion of buildings is equivalent to 23% of 
the area [2]. Figure 4.1 shows an example of Okumura’s curve in the 900 MHz 
band for a city area. Distances below 10 km from the base station are shown to 
have a log scale pathloss, while greater distances have a linear scale loss; this is a 
unique feature of Okumura’s curve. 
It is convenient to calculate data using a closed form equation, although 
propagation loss can be read directly from the Okumura curve. The approxi­
mate equation of the Okumura curve, as derived by Hata, is shown below [3].
The propagation loss LP in a city area is expressed by an equation at a 
frequency f MHz (150 ∼ 1500 MHz), for a mobile station antenna of height 
hm m (1∼10m), with a distance between base station and mobile station of r 
m(1∼20 km) as follow:

As shown in Figure 4.2, the antenna effective height is approximated by 
the height of the average surface of the earth at a point where the mobile termi­
nal is used at between 3 km and 15 km from the base station antenna.
Next, the propagation loss is considered in areas that may be classified 
as suburban or pastoral; these include areas such as those along a road where 
trees and houses disturb the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Under these

tion method. 
It is possible to calculate the output power and antenna gain of the base 
station from the propagation loss estimated by the Okumura-Hata method. If

The system margin is between 10 and 20 dB, and is caused by the unex­

noise level at the location of the base station determines the cell edge of a cellu­
lar system. The noise level in the frequency range of 800–2000 MHz is between 
0–10 dBµV, which may be converted into the unit of dBm by the conversion

An antenna gain of 10 dB is necessary for this estimation if the output 
power of the base station is 20W, which is equivalent to 43 dBm. Based on 
this procedure and other factors, such as the coverage area of the base station 
and the gain of the base station antenna, the transmitter output can then be 
determined.
After the above statistical approach, Ikegami introduced a propagation 
model consisting of free space propagation loss and reflected/detracted loss by 
buildings [4]. Walfisch derived the propagation loss, assuming an urban envi­
ronment as semiinfinite multiscreen [5]. In this model, the diffracted wave at 
the screen top is a dominant factor at received signal at mobile terminals. These 
two models are integrated as the COST-231 Walfisch-Ikegami model, which is 
widely used in recent design of cellular system [6, 7].
4.1.2  Break Point of a Microcell
Okumura’s curve is derived for early land mobile communication systems for 
which the coverage area of the base stations is assumed to be from 0 km to 10 
km in radius. Therefore, it is difficult to apply to a case where the coverage area 
is below 1 km from a base station, such as a microcellular system. This small 
cell sized is used to increase the capacity and high-speed data transmission ca­
pability. Generally, the propagation loss of micro cells is based on line of sight 
propagation (defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1), and a break point is defined 
at the position where the slope of propagation curve changes rapidly [8, 9].
The break point can be explained by the two-wave model, by considering 
the direct path and the ground reflected path. The earth is approximated as a 
flat surface, as shown in Figure 4.4, where the propagation distance is denoted 
by d1 for the direct path between transmission and reception point, and d2 for 
the ground reflected path. When the heights of the transmitting point hb and 
the receiving point hm are very small, as compared to the distance d between the 
transmitting and receiving points, the path difference between these two paths 
is given by the following:

The propagation loss increases rapidly when the path difference given by 
(4.9) is more than a half-wavelength, because a reflection wave from the ground 
cancels a direct wave, due to the 180° phase difference. The point where the 
path difference satisfies the above condition is called a break point, and the cor­
responding distance, b, is defined as:

(4.10)
However, because fading causes large local fluctuations in the measured 
electric field, the position of the break point cannot be clearly determined from 
measurement of the propagation loss. Assume that a break point exists in an 
area between 100m and 500m from a base station; an example measurement 
result is shown in Figure 4.5. From measurements at frequencies 457.3 MHz, 
2.2 GHz, and 4.7 GHz along a checker-shaped road in the city, the break point 
position bm is given as [10]:

Quoted propagation loss estimations are based on measured data at 457.3 
MHz, 2.2 GHz, and 4.7 GHz in Yokohama, where main roads are checker-
shaped. The scaling factor of 1.9 is derived by the measurements. This reference 
has been selected because the frequency range is broad and the closed form 
formula approximates the propagation loss before and after the break point. 
The propagation loss in the line-of-sight region is inversely proportional to 
the distance r (free space loss), and attenuates according to 1/r 4 after the break 
point. If the same expression as the Okumura curve is taken as the propagation

From the measurement carried out in Sapporo city, it is reported that the 
above estimation agrees well when values of s = 0.001, and ho = 1m are used 
for daytime and ho = 0.5m for nighttime [11]. This formula can estimate the 
propagation loss without dividing the path by the break point.
4.1.3  Propagation Loss Outside the Line-of-Sight
In a propagation model for a microcellular system, there may be a sharp turn in 
a road at a corner; this occurrence usually results in a non-line-of-sight scenario. 
Beyond the corner, the waves encounter multiple reflections and diffractions 
the corner, as shown in Figure 4.7. The effects of the diffracted waves are usu­
ally small and can be neglected. The propagation loss may be divided into the 
loss at the corner and that beyond the corner. In general, the loss at the corner 
varies from 10–30 dB, depending on the propagation conditions, the distances 
between the transmitting and receiving points, and the corner. The loss may be 
expressed in terms of the distance d2 from the corner to the receiving point, as:

A further method for estimating the propagation loss uses the total dis­
tance r = d1 +d2 without considering the differences for the regions inside or 
outside the line-of-sight. In this case, the propagation loss is the same as free 
space loss for distances up to 30m away from the transmitting point, and is pro­
portional to 1/r5 for distances of over 30m away. In this case, the corresponding 
expression does not depend on the location of the break point.

4.1.4  Propagation Loss Estimation by the Ray Tracing Method
A large number of propagation experiments are required to derive the approxi­
mate equation for the estimation of propagation loss. Recently, the propagation 
loss (particularly within microcells) has been estimated by numerical simula­
tions using the ray-tracing method. The ray-tracing method approximates elec­
tromagnetic waves by optical rays and is applicable for simulation of reflection, 
diffraction, and scattering by buildings and other obstacles. However, it is dif­
ficult to model all of the real influences precisely. For example, it is impossible 
to include all the influences of trees lining a street, a building’s windows, the 
window frames, or the moving people inside buildings in the calculation mod­

el. However, accurate modeling is indispensable when considering the precise 
changes in electric field level at the receiving point. 
On the other hand, a relatively simple calculation model can give a me­
dian level of electric field strength at the receiving point and the average propa­
gation loss [12]. For example, when most of the buildings in a large city are 
higher than the height of a base station antenna, the propagation loss along a 
street can be approximated by a U-shaped waveguide, for which all the surfaces 
are concrete walls, as shown in Figure 4.8. The electric field strength at the re­
ceiving point in the U-shaped guide is calculated as the sum of the direct waves 
from the transmitting point and the reflected waves from the walls. A calcu­
lated result obtained using such an approximate model is shown in Figure 4.9. 
Once the height of the base station and the radiation pattern of the base station 
antenna are known a priori, propagation characteristics can be calculated. It is 
therefore an effective technique for estimating the propagation phenomena in 
microcellular systems.
4.2 
Design of Cellular Base Station Antennas
This section presents the base station antenna structures, including the feeding 
network, and a synthesis method for pattern shaping to give the desired charac­
teristics. As uplink diversity scheme is mandatory for base station systems, the 
design procedures for space and polarization diversity are also described in this 
section.
4.2.1  Antenna Array Structure and Feeding Circuit
The horizontal radiation pattern is often omnidirectional, but a sector-shaped 
pattern is sometimes used to increase the system capacity. Such a sector system

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
covers the whole of the horizontal plane by dividing it into several sectors. The 
sector pattern is given by the antenna elements supplemented by reflector or 
parasitic elements in front of the antenna, as shown in Figure 4.10. A narrow 
sector pattern with a 60° half-power beam width requires a two-element array 
in the horizontal direction, excited in phase.
The antenna radiation pattern in the vertical plane consists of a shaped 
beam to control the coverage area of the base station and constitutes an array 
antenna in the vertical direction. A simple pattern used for cellular systems is a 
pencil beam to increase the directive gain in the horizontal direction. This pat­
tern is given by an array in which the phases and amplitudes of all the elements 
are the same.
A cooperate-feed network, as shown in Figure 4.11(a), provides the in-
phase excitation. This feed network is useful for high gain antennas of more 
than 15 dBi, although an antenna gain of about 10 dBi may be obtained with a 
colinear array [shown in Figure 4.11 (b)]. Such colinear arrays consist of several 
half-wavelength coaxial cables connecting the inner conductor of the lower ele­
ment to the upper outer conductor in order to change the phase alternatively 
at the edge. Although this antenna structure is very simple, the beam tilt angle 
and the input impedance matching are not controlled independently. In gen­
eral, the beam tilt angle is fixed first and impedance matching is obtained by an 
external matching network.

Typical antenna elements for cellular systems are the printed dipole, the 
microstrip, and the printed slot, as shown in Figure 4.12. The antenna element 
is selected according to the design of base station and its cost. The feeding net­
work is usually made with microstrip line.
4.2.2  Beam Tilting and Propagation Characteristics
To increase the subscriber capacity in current cellular systems, a smaller coverage 
area is required for each base station. In the frequency division multiple access 
(FDMA) system, the same frequency can be used in nearby cells. A restriction 
in the coverage area is also seen in the code division multiple access (CDMA) 
system, because the increase in the number of users in the same cell raises the 
base noise level. Therefore, a similar cell form is required for both FDMA and 
CDMA systems. To restrict the cell size, the beam tilting technique shown in 
Figure 4.13 is effective. In the FDMA system, the null position of the antenna 
pattern is directed towards another cell in order to minimize the interference 
between cells using the same frequency band.
Using tilted beams, the propagation loss becomes larger than that without 
tilting, as shown in Figure 4.14, which also shows the effectiveness of using 
tilted beam antennas. 
For a system in which the antenna height of the base station is h(m) and 
the cell radius is a(m), the tilt angle θt may be determined as:

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
A design example of the vertical plane pattern for a base station antenna 
is shown in Figure 4.15. Denoting θ = 0° as the horizon, the lower region 0 < 
θ < 90° is a pattern corresponding to cosec2θ and the upper region, –90° < θ 
< 0°, is designed as a Taylor distribution specifying the side lobe level [13]. In 
particular, the level in the direction of another cell using the same frequency is 
often specified as very low. This design is based on antenna pattern synthesis, 
and the excitation condition of each antenna element is evaluated by fixing the 
element spacing as described in the following procedure.
As a design example, the least squares method for pattern synthesis is 
presented. If the desired radiation pattern is gd(θ), as shown in Figure 4.16, the 
pattern given by the actual feeding network of g(θ) may be expressed by the 
amplitude Ii and phase φi as:

4.2.3  Sector Antennas
The sector zone allocation requires a fan-shaped pattern in the horizontal plane. 
However, an ideal fan-shape cannot be obtained from a real antenna, and the 
span of a sector is specified by the half-power beamwidth. This real sector pat­
tern may be approximated by denoting the half power beam width as φb [14] 
and the front-to-back ratio as FB, where:

Current cellular systems use three-sector zones, where the half-power 
beamwidth is 90° or 120°. The beamwidth depends on the system design. Al­
though a narrow beam increases the user number, it sometimes causes blind 
regions at the cell edge. Therefore, the base station location is important. Six 
sectors are also used because such an arrangement doubles the capacity of the 
three-sector system [15].
4.2.4  Diversity Antennas
Up-link diversity reception is mandatory for base station antennas in order to 
combat multipath fading. The diversity reception (described in Chapter 1, Sec­
tion 1.3.1) is also used to compensate for power imbalance between up-link 
and down-link, because the up-link signal is weaker than that of the down-link. 
For a system with space diversity, the same antenna is installed with a spacing of 
more than 10 wavelengths (λ). The correlation coefficient for this space diver­
sity, as shown in Figure 4.17, is calculated by assuming that the uplink signals 
originate from inside the angle ψm with uniform distribution. The correlation 
coefficient of ρe is evaluated from the definition of (2.37) as:

10λ, because ψm > 1.5° is obtained from propagation measurements in the cit­
ies [16].
Mobile telephone services started as vehicular mounted mobile terminals. 
Recent developments in electronics technology have resulted in very small and 
lightweight portable handsets. As a result, everyone now uses a handset placed 
near the ear at a tilted angle. As derived from statistical data [17], the tilt angle 
is about 60°, and this decreases the vertical radiation component by 6 dB, and 
the horizontal component by 5 dB more than the vertical component. This 
operating condition results in an increase in the horizontal electric field com­
ponent in the up-link, and polarization diversity is therefore desired for base 
station designs.
Vaughan measured a polarization diversity scheme in the 400 MHz band 
using a tilted dipole as a mobile terminal [18], and showed the correlation coef­
ficient between horizontal and vertical components to be almost zero in both 
the city and the suburbs. Propagation experiments by Turkmani at 1.8 GHz 
resulted in a diversity gain of 1 to 2 dB for vertically-oriented dipole antennas at 
the mobile terminal and 3 to 5.2 dB for 45° tilted antennas [19]. The measured 
correlation coefficient quoted by Lotse at 1.8 GHz was less than 0.2 [20], and 
the diversity gain depended the average received signal level. The polarization 
diversity gain measurement for the case with a human operator using a handset 
was 7 dB greater than the space diversity in the line of sight region, and 1 dB 
greater non-line-of-sight region [21]. The polarization diversity system using 
vertical and horizontal components has the merit of minimizing the antenna 
installation space, and has been adopted for Japanese cellular systems. An ex­
ample of this diversity antenna is shown in Figure 4.19.
Another polarization diversity system uses slant polarization of ±45°. The 
correlation coefficient is about 0.5 and smaller than the diversity in the above, 
but the received signal levels for both diversity ports are equal, which gives the 
Figure 4.17  Coordinate system for space diversity antenna.

same diversity gain as with vertical and horizontal diversity systems. This slant 
diversity system is widely used in cellular systems.
4.3  Base Station Antenna Measurements
Base station antenna measurements are classified into low-power tests and high-
power tests. In the low-power tests, the antenna radiation pattern and the input 
impedance characteristics are measured. A similar procedure as that used for 
handset terminal antenna can also be used to measure the input impedance of 
the base station antenna, and this is presented in Chapter 2. For base station 
antenna pattern measurement, it is necessary for perform measurements in an 
open site or near-field measurement is needed when the antenna has a high 
gain. The beamwidth and the position of the null point should be verified for 
the designed coverage area of the cell, then, this section presents the measure­
ment method for high gain antennas. In any case, the passive inter modulation 
(PIM) causes serious problems, especially when the base station antenna is op­

measurement method. Finally, the section also presents the inspection process 
of the base station antenna as a product. 
4.3.1  Antenna Pattern Measurements in Open Sites
The distance R between the transmit and receive antennas should satisfy the 
condition R ≥ 2D2/λ, defined by (2.15),to measure the far-field radiation, as 
presented in Chapter 2, where the maximum dimension of the antenna is de­
noted as D. For a cell radius under 3 km, the vertical radiation pattern of the 
base station antenna can be controlled by electronically adjusting the phase of 
the array elements. Because the dimension in the vertical direction becomes 
more than 10λ for the pipe-shaped form, and the measurement distance R re­
quires more than 200λ as a far field condition, in the 900 MHz band, a distance 
of more than 67m is necessary, which is difficult to obtain in an indoor facility. 
Measurement in an open site is therefore necessary, and the transmit antenna 
must be installed on a steel tower or a building, as shown in the Figure 4.20, 
in order to satisfy the above far field condition. For radiation pattern measure­

ment, it is necessary to prevent interference from the radio link that is actually 
in-use and to suppress reflections from surrounding buildings. In order to avoid 
receiving waves reflected from the ground, the antenna aperture size d should 
satisfy the following equation, where hr is the height of the receive antenna (the 
antenna used for the measurements) and R is the distance between the transmit 
and the receive antennas:

antenna. If the aperture size of the transmit antenna is much greater than the 
wavelength, and the antenna aperture is assumed to have a uniform current 
distribution, the half-power beamwidth 2θh of the transmitting antenna may 
be approximated by the equation shown below. This equation was derived so 
that the edge of the half-power beam points to the tower base of the receiving 
antenna:

When the required distance is not available for the measurements, a dif­
fraction fence may be installed on the central ground between the transmit 
and the receive antennas to avoid the influence of the waves reflected from the 
ground. The diffraction fence should be mounted so as to not interrupt the 
main beam between the transmit and receive antennas, and it should be a saw-
shape fence in order to give a knife’s edge diffraction.

A measurement method that uses the reflection from the ground actively 
is shown in Figure 4.21. The antenna under test is installed on the tower, and 
the height of the receive antenna near the ground is adjusted so that the maxi­
mum electric field strength is received. In this method, it is assumed that the re­
flection coefficient at the ground has a value close to –1 when both the transmit 
and the receive antennas are located just above the ground. Measurement can be 
made in similar conditions by adjusting the height for an arbitrary frequency. 
Based on the condition that the phase difference in the image antenna becomes 
(λ/2), the height hr of the antenna under test may be determined as:

For the slant range measurement, the antenna under test is installed on 
the top of the high steel tower, as shown in Figure 4.22; the measurement 
antenna on the ground is pointed towards it with a large elevation angle. The 
reflection waves from the ground are radiated from the direction of the side 
lobes. This is an effective method to determine the direct path component in 
the measurement. However, the waves reflected from the surrounding buildings 
need to be avoided.
4.3.2  Near-Field Antenna Pattern Measurement
The problems associated with open site measurements include noise from the 
surroundings of the site, the influence of weather, and the requirement for a 
license to transmit electromagnetic waves at high power levels. A technique for

A different approach that reduces the computation time is given by wave 
vector expansion and the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The electric field radi­

4.3.2.2  Near-Field Measurement
In an example of large aperture size, such as a parabolic reflector antenna, the 
electromagnetic fields are defined differently, by distance in the vicinity, in the 
near field region, and in the far field region, respectively, as shown in Figure 
4.24. Accordingly, the equivalent theory for the electromagnetic field gives the 
radiation field by using the field in the antenna vicinity. For field measurements 
in the vicinity of the antenna, the mutual coupling between the measurement 
probe and the antenna being tested becomes very high and disturbs the elec­
tromagnetic field radiated from the antenna. Therefore, measurements in the 
vicinity of the antenna are very difficult to obtain. Although it is possible to 
exclude this mutual coupling by probe correction techniques, measurements in 
this region are not generally performed because of the instability of the mea­
sured field. 
Next to the region in the vicinity of the antenna is the near field. A suit­
able probe for near-field measurement consists of an open-ended rectangular 
waveguide, which does not have an isotropic radiation pattern. The nonideal 

 
Base Station Antenna Siting and Measurement 
151
performance can be rectified easily by probe correction [22], and the far-field 
can then be evaluated from the electromagnetic field in the near-field region. 
Although near-field measurements require a space enclosing the antenna, a 
closed edge plane is not always necessary when the measured field strength is 
small enough to neglect. The probe’s scanning surface for near-field measure­
ments can be planar, cylindrical, or spherical, as shown in Figure 4.25. Planar 
surface scanning covers only half of the space during the measurements, and is 
appropriate for high-gain antenna measurements, such as parabolic antennas. 
Base station antennas used in cellular systems and marine radar antennas have 
fan-shaped patterns with a narrow beam in one plane and a wide beam in the 
other; cylindrical scanning is appropriate for near-field measurements on these 
kinds of antennas. Spherical scanning is appropriate for low-gain antennas, be­
cause the probe is scanned in all directions.
The scanning area (A × B) and the sampling interval (∆x, ∆y) are dis­
cussed in the planar scanning method and are shown in Figure 4.26. The size 
of the scanning area is determined by the requirement to obtain more than a 
35 dB dynamic range in the scanning area, without the need to interpolate 
the measured data. In this case, the dynamic range is defined by the difference 
between the maximum electric field strength and the edge field strength. The 
maximum data point spacing should be such that ∆x = λo/2 and ∆y = λo/2 for 
planar scanning, using the sampling theorem [22]. 
4.3.2.3  Far-Field Evaluation in Near-Field Measurements
If the x and y components of the measured electric field are Ex(x,y) and Ey(x,y), 
respectively, the far-field radiation patterns are given by (4.33) and (4.34), and 
the coordinate transformation from (x, y, z) to (r, θ, φ) as:

4.3.3  High-Power and Passive Intermodulation Tests
4.3.3.1  Definition of Passive Intermodulation
Passive intermodulation (PIM) is a technique wherein a given frequency prod­
uct is generated by combining several different frequencies that are inputs to 
a circuit with nonlinear input-output characteristics. This nonlinear phenom­
enon is observed at the junction between a connector and a transmission line, 
where there is a contact between different metals. The base station antenna is 
used for both transmission and reception, and its transmit power level is several 
watts per channel. The up-link received electric field strength is between 10 and 
60 dBµV, which represents a difference from the transmit power of around 100 
dB. The received field strength is equivalent to –103 to –53 dB min the 50Ω 
transmission line system. This power imbalance becomes more than 140 dB 
with multichannel input to base station antennas, and causes the PIM in the 
passive device. 
Most current cellular systems are duplex, with the transmit and receive 
frequency bands allocated at a certain interval. A further receive antenna is 
necessary for the base station, in addition to the antennas for transmission and 
reception, because of the up-link diversity system. A duplex cellular system 
uses the frequency bands for transmission and reception simultaneously. When 
the PIM occurs at the antenna for both transmission and reception, it appears 
on the receive frequency band and the receive channel cannot be used due to 
interference at the base station.
Although the antenna is a passive device, very weak electric discharge 
phenomena occur at the junctions of the antenna parts during high-power op­
eration. Such discharges often appear at the surface of the junctions that are 
made of different metals. This phenomenon causes the antenna to have a non­
linear input-output response that may be regarded as a two-port circuit with

The order of PIM is 2

p ± , the input frequencies of the receiver, and these 
frequencies cause the most serious problems to down-link frequency.
Figure 4.27 shows the allocation of uplink and downlink frequency bands 
for cellular systems with upper and lower limit edge frequencies of f1 and f2, 
respectively. The frequency interval should be allocated so that it is not affected 
by the third and fifth order PIM, as shown in Figure 4.27. However, the PIM 
should consider real frequency allocations. PIM signals are expressed as an ab­
solute value in dBm and a relative value in dBc, normalized by the input signal. 
For example, for a PIM level of –100 dBm, the relative PIM value is –143 dBc, 
normalized by two input signals of 43 dBm.
4.3.3.2  PIM Measurement Setup
Figure 4.28 shows the block diagram of the PIM measurement setup. The mea­
surement system consists of three units connected to the three ports of the du­
plexer, which operates as a transmission port, a reception port, and a common 
port for both transmission and reception. After amplification to the required 
power level, the two continuous signals P1 and P2, at different frequencies, are 
input to the transmit port of the duplexer through the power combiner. The 
device under test (DUT) is connected to the common port for both transmis­
sion and reception. 
When the DUT is used as a connector and a transmission cable, the pow­
er is dissipated into a dummy load. When the DUT is an antenna, the antenna 
under test is set up inside of an anechoic chamber. With this measurement 
setup, the PIM signal detected at the reception port is measured by a spectrum 
analyzer. If the PIM signal level is less than the noise level of the spectrum 
analyzer, a low noise amplifier (LNA) is inserted to adjust the receiving level. 
By inserting a band-pass filter prior to the LNA, the direct coupling from trans­
Figure 4.27  Frequency allocation for higher order PIM.

156 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
mitting port to receiving port is eliminated. The band-pass filter suppresses the 
undesired PIM occurring in the LNA and the spectrum analyzer.
When the DUT is both a connector and a transmission cable, a terminat­
ing load is used, as shown in Figure 4.29. When a resistor is used as a dummy 
load, this also tends to have a PIM within it. Therefore, a long coaxial cable, 
similar to a semirigid cable, is often used instead of a resistor. The coaxial cable 
between 50 and 100m long is usually long enough to be used as a dummy load. 
This long cable then dissipates most of the power. After confirming that there is 
no PIM excitation at the interconnection between the duplexer and DUT, the 
PIM may be measured using the above setup.
During PIM measurements on antennas, metallic objects should not be 
located near the antenna under test in order to avoid the occurrence of PIM by 
induced current excitation. The PIM for antennas should preferably be mea­
sured inside an anechoic chamber, although measurements can also be made in 
open sites. In open site measurements, the main beam of the antenna is directed 
towards the sky. PIM phenomena may occur at several points, but the PIM 
signals may be difficult to observe, due to phase cancellation by each other. To 
avoid this phase cancellation, the PIM should be measured at several different 
frequencies.

4.3.3.3  PIM Tests for Products
PIM measurement procedures for commercial-basedstation antennas are de­
scribed in the following. Using the measurement setup described in Section 
4.3.3.2, a plastic hammer is used to knock each part of the antenna under test. 
Three kinds of measured PIM phenomena may be observed: high-level PIM 
occurring continuously, high-level PIM that occurs only during knocking, or 
variable-level PIM that occurs as a step function due to knocking. It should be 
noted that the measured PIM disappears after knocking. Using this knocking 
test, the problematic parts of the antenna where the PIM occured can be found. 
It should be noted with caution, however, that the PIM phenomena sometimes 
reappear after a period of time.
4.4  Product Inspection
This section presents production inspection tests that should be undertaken 
before base station antennas are shipped. Similar tests are presented in Chapter 
2, Section 2.6 for mobile handset terminals. It is necessary for the products 
to satisfy these specifications. In addition to the electrical performance, the 
input characteristics and the radiation pattern, mechanical, and reliability tests 
(for example, vibration and moisture-proof tests) are also required because the 
products are going to be used in a real-world environment. The antennas dis­
cussed in this section are for outdoor base stations, as well as for small indoor 
base stations. Outdoor antennas are usually used for cellular coverage; indoor 
antennas are usually used for in-building mobile communication systems or for 
microcellular systems. The tests presented here are not carried out on all base 
station antennas, and in most cases, the operator and the manufacturer decide 
the product inspection procedures to be adopted, depending on the environ­
ment in which the antennas are intended to be used.
This section presents example specification data; however, these examples 
are mainly based on Japanese standards. The environment in Japan is very harsh 
for base station antennas because there are earthquakes, typhoons, and heavy 
snow in metropolitan areas. Inspection tests should therefore be chosen appro­
priately to match the environment in each country.
4.4.1  Radiation Pattern 
4.4.1.1  Directivity Gain
The absolute gain (dBi) or the relative gain (dBd) of an antenna in the direc­
tion of maximum radiation is measured as the antenna gain. The measurement 
procedure for antenna gain is described in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.3.2.

158 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
4.4.1.2  Radiation Pattern
The specifications for the radiation pattern for base station antennas, defined 
on the horizontal and vertical planes or on the E-plane and H-plane, are: cross-
polarization ratio (XPR), as defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.2.5, and half-power 
beamwidth. The XPR is required to be more than 20 or 25 dB on the specified 
radiation plane. The beamwidth is defined by the deviation because of the fre­
quency dependence and varying quality of the product. For example, the edge 
level of half-power beamwidth for 60° is 3±1 dB, or 3±0.5 dB at φ = ±30°. The 
difference from the definition written in most books is due to the inclusion of 
the above deviation [24]. Additionally, the polarization in the measurement is 
based on the slant polarization diversity antenna being measured by means of a 
±45° tilted antenna to coincide with the polarization for both transmission and 
reception. For a space diversity antenna system using only the vertical polariza­
tion, the antenna pattern characteristics are tested only for vertical polarization. 
4.4.1.3  Beam Tilt Angle
To adjust the coverage area of the base station, the antenna main beam is tilted 
an angle θt below the horizon. This angle is then defined as the tilt angle.
4.4.1.4  Front-to-Back Ratio
In sector zone cellular systems, the front-to-back (FB) ratio is defined as the 
ratio between the forward main beam level and the backward level. The defini­
tion of FB ratio is the forward radiation level at φ = 0° divided by the backward 
level at φ = 180°. Another definition is obtained by taking the backward radia­
tion as the maximum radiation level in the region of 120° ≤ φ ≤ 240° or 90° ≤ 
φ ≤ 270°, where φ = 0°corresponds to the forward direction. In the ±45° tilted 
polarization antenna, the backward polarization is orthogonal to the front one. 
It should be carefully checked in the FB ratio measurement.
4.4.2  Antenna Input-Port Characteristics
4.4.2.1  Voltage Standing Wave Ratio
The voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) (defined in Chapter 2, Section 2.1.1) 
at the input port of base station antennas is required to be less than 2.0 in the 
specified frequency band.
4.4.2.2  Power-Resistance Capacity
For the power-resistance test, the input characteristics of the antenna should 
not vary for a specified input power. An example of input power might be 30W 
per input port. The power-resistance test is carried out at the center frequency 
of the specified frequency band. The procedures used in the power test should 

 
Base Station Antenna Siting and Measurement 
159
not cause any heating problems, and the VSWR at the input port should not 
vary at high-power input.
4.4.2.3  Insulation Resistance
Typically, an insulation resistance of more than 100MΩ is required at the an­
tenna input port, with the resistance measured by connecting the probes of an 
insulation resistance tester between the center conductor and the outer con­
ductor at the input connector [25]. The maximum voltage of the tester in this 
example is 500V.
4.4.2.4  High Voltage-Resistance Performance
After applying 1000V AC for 60 seconds between the center conductor and 
the outer conductor at the antenna input port, it should be verified that the 
antenna characteristics, such as VSWR, have not changed. The test procedure 
is the same as for the power-resistance test.
The tests for both the insulation resistance and power resistance are not 
applied to the antenna with a direct short-circuit, as it would be the case for a 
log-periodic antenna.
4.4.2.5  Conductivity Performance
As a conductivity performance test, the AC resistance between the inner and 
outer conductors at the antenna input port should be less than 100mΩ.
4.4.2.6  Other Performance Tests
In the case of multiport base station antennas (such as polarization diversity 
antennas and multiband antennas), the mutual coupling between the antenna 
ports is defined as the isolation characteristics (described in Chapter 2, Section 
2.1.2). The isolation should be more than 25 dB in the range of specified fre­
quency band at the two input/output ports of a polarization diversity antenna.
4.4.3  Feed Circuit
Recently developed base station antennas adjust their coverage areas by chang­
ing their tilt angle in the vertical plane, and both mechanical and electrical 
methods can be used for beam tilting. In the electrical method, the base station 
antenna consists of several subarray units, and the phase of each is electronically 
changed for beam tilting. Therefore, the antenna system has two components: 
the antenna itself and a feed circuit for phase adjustment. Three types of phase 
adjusting system may be used for the feed circuit: remote control, manual con­
trol, and fixed advance. Digital remote control is mostly based on specifications 
by Antenna Interface Specification Group (AISG) [26].
The performances of all the above control schemes are similar and one or 
another will be selected, depending on the cost of the base station(s). The phase 

160 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
control unit is located separately from the antenna unit, as shown in Figure 
4.30. This feed circuit is tested independently of the antenna unit. The mea­
surements made are the same as for antenna measurements, and include VSWR, 
power-resistance capability, insulation resistance, high voltage-resistance perfor­
mance, conductivity performance, and mutual coupling between input ports. 
These tests are not conducted on antennas operated at a fixed beam tilt angle, 
and those in which phase differences are provided to each antenna element. 
4.4.4  Appearance and Weight 
The dimensions and total weight of each antenna part should be within specifi­
cation. The nameplate, logo, and color should also be confirmed.
4.4.4.1  Antenna Construction
The antenna construction, as shown in the specifications given by the cellular 
company, must be verified.
4.4.4.2   Assembly Instructions
The assembly instructions are required to be sufficiently comprehensive in or­
der to ensure that mistakes will not be made during installation.
4.4.4.3  Range of Mechanical Adjustment
If the beam tilt adjustment is performed mechanically, the range of adjustment 
available must be verified. In addition, the adjustment range of the movable 
polarization plane should also be checked (if applicable).

4.4.4.4  Wind Pressure Resistance
Depending on the wind pressure on the antenna, it should be confirmed that 
the radome and the other antenna parts have sufficient mechanical strength to 
withstand a wind velocity, v, of up to 60m/s. This check is usually carried out 
by numerical calculation. If the wind pressure is q(kgf/m2) and the wind pres­
sure coefficient is C, the wind pressure loading P (kgf/m2) is:

and h is the antenna height. The wind pressure coefficient C for antenna pil­
lars with square and circular cross sections has values of 2 and 0.8, respectively. 
Therefore, a circular column is preferable from the viewpoint of wind pressure. 
In a typical example, the wind pressure loading may be larger than 350 kgf/m2.
In addition, the allowed rolling vibration range is within ±2 degrees for 
a wind velocity of 60m/s. Furthermore, no noise should be generated by the 
wind.
4.4.4.5  Other Tests
If a phase control unit is added to the antenna system, its tolerance should also 
be checked.
4.4.5  Reliability Examination
The reliability of antennas is examined according to the standard regulations 
of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The typical tests in­
volved are described below.
4.4.5.1  Thermal Test (Heat Cycle Test)
The antenna characteristics are examined in a heat cycle test under conditions 
in which the humidity is more than 90% and the temperature range is from 
–30°C to +60° C.  The actual heat cycle is as follows: after the temperature has 
been raised from a room temperature of +20°C, the antenna is held at the high­
est temperature of +60°C for several hours. The temperature is then dropped 
to the lowest level of –30° C and is held at this level for several more hours. It 
is then raised again to the highest temperature. This procedure represents one 
cycle of the thermal test. During a complete test program, the input VSWR is 
checked after tens of test cycles.

162 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
For small indoor base station antennas that can be tested inside a compact 
box, the variations of temperature with time during a heat cycle test are as de­
scribed below [27]. The temperature is raised from the room level of +20°C to 
+50°C in one and a half hours, and this high temperature level is held for three 
hours. The temperature is then dropped from +50°C to –20°C in three hours, 
and the temperature held at –20°C for three hours. Finally, the temperature is 
raised again to +20°C in one and a half hours. This variation corresponds to 
one heat cycle. 
When automatic temperature control is not available, the following is 
used as one heat cycle: the temperature is held at +50°C for four hours after 
raising it from room level, then a temperature of –20°C is maintained for four 
hours. Finally, the antenna under test is left at room temperature for a further 
two hours. The antenna characteristics, such as the input VSWR, are evaluated 
several times during the heat cycle.
4.4.5.2  Heat (Cold) Resistance Performance
Vehicular-mounted antennas are tested for a few hours in a heat-resistance test 
at 90°C and a cold-resistance test at –40°C. As a heat shock test, the heat/
cold-resistance test covers a period of three hours and is repeated several times. 
However, this test is not often performed.
4.4.5.3  Waterproofing and Moisture-Proof Performance
The waterproofing test is carried out on the product before it is shipped. The 
moisture-proof test is applicable to both the parts and the materials of the an­
tennas. An example of a waterproofing test is as follows: in the same installation 
as intended for real-world use, water is sprinkled all over the antenna using a 
nozzle mounted above the antenna being tested at a height of 300–500 mm. 
As an example of the sprinkling rate, the quantity of water may be 10 ±0.5l per 
minute, with a pressure of between 50–150 kPa for more than one hour. On 
completion of this waterproofing test, whether or not the insulation resistance 
at the antenna input port has changed is confirmed.
A sealed type antenna used for small base stations may be immersed into 
a water tank at a depth of more than 400 mm for 24 hours, and the penetration 
of water is then confirmed by breaking up the antenna. The moisture-proof 
performance of small base station antennas can be tested using a box at constant 
temperature and humidity. As an example of a typical test cycle, the antenna 
is left inside the box at a temperature of 40°C and a humidity of 80% for 96 
hours. It is then placed in an area at room temperature and humidity for an 
hour. After this cycle, the antenna input VSWR characteristics should not have 
changed.

It should be noted that these waterproof and moisture-proof tests are ap­
plied only to a sample of the products [28]. The tests carried out before ship­
ping include VSWR measurement and appearance checking.
4.4.5.4  Vibration Test
For antennas used in areas subject to vibration, such as on highways, a vibration 
test is required. Before the vibration test, the mechanical resonance frequency 
is measured by vibrating the antenna at variable frequency in both the vertical 
and horizontal directions, with an accelerometer attached to each part of the 
antenna. The antenna is then vibrated at the measured resonant frequency in 
the x, y, and z directions. In a typical test example, a force of 5G is applied for 
an hour in the z direction and for half an hour in the x and y directions. After 
the vibration test, whether or not the VSWR has changed must be confirmed.

Indoor Measurement Simulators
In mobile communication systems, modulated electromagnetic waves arrive at 
a reception point as a summation of several waves that propagated along differ­
ent paths. The characteristics of these waves are distributed randomly, and this 
causes spatially distributed standing waves. Under these conditions, when the 
receiver position moves, the received electric field strength varies greatly. This 
phenomenon is called interference fading or multipath fading, and is the most 
serious problem in mobile communication systems. Mobile terminals are tested 
at the development stage to ascertain whether or not they can satisfy the speci­
fications when fading is present. The tests involve propagation measurements 
in a real outdoor environment. The random field measurement described in 
Chapter 2 is a well-known method for testing the performance of mobile termi­
nals in a multipath propagation environment. However, the outdoor propaga­
tion measurement is not always stable in time; it is also necessary to obtain a li­
cense in order to satisfy the regulations. These considerations indicate the need 
for an indoor facility to reproduce the real multipath propagation environment. 
There are two methods that can be used to reproduce fading phenomena. 
One is to generate fading waves as a radio frequency (RF) output signal from 
a radio unit following the antenna port; such an arrangement then constitutes 
a fading simulator. The other is to reproduce fading waves as a summation of 
spatially distributed standing waves in an artificial multipath propagation envi­
ronment, typically in an indoor facility. This is another type of field simulator 
in which radio equipment products can be tested.
This chapter describes the principles and operation of fading field simu­
lators, which are indispensable for the development of mobile terminals. In 
addition to antenna performance evaluation, channel capacity is also an impor­
tant factor for mobile terminals for high-speed data transmission. The channel 
capacity is enhanced by multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This 

166 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
chapter also describes a theory of MIMO channel capacity estimation and an 
indoor MIMO emulator for the handset antenna testing.
5.1  Fading Simulator
The received voltage at the input port of the radio unit can be regarded as a 
function of time for moving terminals. This is because the RF signal trans­
mitted from the base station arrives at the reception point as a summation of 
multipath waves, which results in standing waves. The received voltage often 
falls to a level close to the noise level, which then constitutes a fading phenom­
enon. In the development of communication systems and radio equipment, the 
performance should be confirmed under real fading conditions. However, real 
propagation measurements have the problems described above, and, therefore, 
the use of fading simulators is mandatory for tests on radio equipment for mo­
bile communication systems. The required performance of a fading simulator 
must include the reproduction of Doppler fading due to the velocity of mobile 
terminals, more than one correlated reception signal with fading, and wideband 
characteristics to cover the allocated frequency bands. This section presents the 
theory and circuit structure of such a fading simulator.
5.1.1  Theory of Fading Simulators
We first discuss the theory behind the fading simulator [1, 2]. In mobile cellular 
communication systems, a mobile terminal, moving in a multipath fading envi­
ronment, receives an electric field with a varying amplitude following Rayleigh 
distribution and with randomly distributed phases [3]. As shown in Chapter 1, 
Section 1.2.3, by assuming that a large number of waves, with almost the same 
amplitude, arriving at a reception point, the fading signal may be expressed, as:

The above equations indicate that fading signals can be obtained by mod­
ulating the in-phase component cos

with two independent baseband noise signals x(t), y(t) respectively, as shown 
in Figure 5.1. In this case, the modulation is double side-banded with carrier 
suppression. The power spectra for the two base band noise signals used for the

modulation are given as functions of the velocity of the mobile terminal v(m/s) 
and the maximum Doppler frequency fD = v/λ (Hz) as:

Although a cycle of the output signal of the fading simulator is the same 
as that of the M-sequence code, an effective length of more than 1600 wave­
lengths is sufficient for the measurement facility. The M-sequence (maximum 
length code) is used to obtain random sequences. The M-sequence generator 
can be easily constructed from a shift register and an exclusive OR (XOR) oper­
ator, an arrangement that is often employed in digital communication systems 
to synchronize input and output signals.

One technique that reduces fading effects in mobile communication sys­
tems is diversity reception with more than one input branch with small cor­

As a result, two correlated fading signals are generated by modulating the 
in-phase and orthogonal components with four independent base band noise 
signals, after linear transformation of (5.6). The correlation coefficient is arbi­
trarily defined by f1 and f2.
5.1.2  Delay Spread Simulation
In mobile communication systems, the propagation path from a transmitting 
source to a reception point has a different length for each frequency, and causes 
delay spread distribution, especially in high-speed digital data transmissions. To 
examine mobile terminals under this delay spread condition, a fading simulator 
is required to have frequency selective fading characteristics. The amplitude of 
each delayed signal is adjusted by an arbitrary scaling coefficient, and all the 
delayed signals are combined in the last stage by a power combiner [4].
For frequency selective fading in a real propagation environment, the de­
lay time, the amplitude, and the phase of the delayed wave all behave as func­
tions of time. Measured delay times for current digital cellular systems vary 
from a few hundreds of nanoseconds (ns) to tens of microseconds (µs). To 
obtain real frequency selective fading, the transverse filter implemented by a 
large scale integration (LSI) circuit in Figure 5.2 must process the signal in the 
time domain. This signal processing fills the base-band frequency with digital 
data, which gives detailed parameter settings for delay spread simulation. The 
synthesized digital signal is input to a band pass filter after D/A conversion, and 
is modulated by Gaussian noise to generate fading waves [5]. This type of field 
simulator is used to evaluate the equalizer used to suppress the delayed waves 
in mobile terminals.
5.1.3  Measurement Using a Fading Simulator
A bit error rate (BER) is used to evaluate the diversity performance of handset 
terminals in digital cellular systems in a multipath propagation environment. 
The BER is calculated by the number of error codes for a given number of the 
correct codes input to the equipment. Figure 5.3 shows a system block diagram 
for evaluating the diversity performance [6]. By setting the measurement fre­
quency as the center frequency of the RF signal generator, the median value of 
the detected signal level, observed by the power meter, is adjusted to a specified 
value by an attenuator. After this setting has been made, the output port is 

170 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
switched to the equipment under test and the BER is measured. The maximum 
BER is specified as a standard for handset terminals. In diversity performance 
evaluation, the levels of two output ports are adjusted using the same procedure 
as described above, and the BER is measured by connecting the two output 
ports to the test equipment.
5.2  Field Simulators
The recent remarkable increase in the number of subscribers in mobile commu­
nications requires miniaturized and high-performance handset terminals. Using

the fading simulator described in the preceding section, the characteristics of 
handset terminals may be evaluated by inputting a fading wave to the antenna 
input port with the handset antenna removed. The test is effective for evaluat­
ing the radio unit of a handset terminal without the antenna. However, it is 
also necessary to confirm the characteristics of the product with the antenna 
included. The product test performed inside an anechoic chamber, as described 
in Chapter 2, is not sufficient for mobile terminals intended for use in urban 
multipath propagation environments. Although the random field measurement 
can effectively confirm the characteristics of the handset, the stable measure­
ment environment present in an indoor facility is required for the develop­
ment of handset terminals. This section presents the theory and structure of a 
field simulator for the evaluation of handset terminals in an artificial multipath 
propagation environment. The fading simulator reproduces fading signals as 
RF signals fed through a coaxial cable, while the field simulator generates fading 
waves as a summation of spatially distributed electromagnetic waves.
By installing multiple radiating sources and scattering obstacles inside of 
a large anechoic chamber, artificial fading can be generated. However, such a 
large facility is not appropriate in the design process for handsets, and a more 
compact field simulator that can be set up in a laboratory is required. 
As described in Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2, we can obtain the same correla­
tion coefficient between two antennas by measuring the S-parameter and 3D 
pattern. Multipath fading in outdoor environment is assumed to be caused by 
randomly distributed incoming waves from all the directions, hence the genera­
tion of a random field is necessary for the handset testing. This technique is also 
used in the antenna radiation efficiency measurement (described in Chapter 
2, Section  2.3), and the electromagnetic computability (EMC) measurement 
(described in Chapter 2, Section 2.5). This technique eliminates the effect of 
different radiation patterns in handset antennas. A reverberation chamber based 
on the same principle (described in Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2) is one of the 
measurement facilities to generate random field by rotating vanes inside a shield 
room [7]. Another approach is called as field simulator, and which does not 
require the use of mechanical moving structures.
Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 describes the theory and structure of a field simu­
lator for handset evaluation in artificial multipath propagation environments. 
Additionally, measurements of diversity antennas built in to a handset terminal 
are included in Section 5.2.3. 
5.2.1  Theory of Field Simulators
Simple fading may be measured by moving a device under test (DUT) along a 
standing wave that is generated by a feed probe and reflectors, as shown in Fig­
ure 5.4. The feed probe is constructed from a monopole antenna installed on 

172 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
a large ground plane, and is placed a quarter wavelength (λ/4) away from one 
reflector in order to excite the standing wave effectively.  The distance between 
the two reflectors is set to mλ/2, where m is a natural number [8]. 
The number of incoming waves to a mobile terminal in a cellular system 
is seven or eight [9], and this is quite different from the standing wave case 
described above, which consisted of only two waves.  Several transmit antennas 
installed inside the anechoic chamber can reproduce the same multipath fading 
environment, and the characteristics of the DUT mounted on a rotator inside 
chamber can be measured under fading conditions. A disadvantage of this sys­
tem is its necessity for a large space.
An actual solution is to reproduce multipath fading by generating seven 
or eight waves in a limited space; the fading waves at an observation point can 
be written as a function of time. To generate interference fading using a limited 
number of sources, the reflected waves from the conducting reflector must be 
appropriate for the field simulator. A compact field simulator consists of the 
transmitting antennas installed on the walls inside of a shielded room. 
The basic parameters for field simulators are the number of sources and 
the dimensions of the box. The required performance involves the generation 
of arbitrary probability distributions from Rayleigh to Rician, and the arbitrary 
correlation coefficient between two observation points. Frequency shifting due 
to the Doppler effect of the moving terminal is not considered for simplicity of 
the simulator structure.
The field simulator, surrounded by conducting walls, is regarded as an 
oversized rectangular waveguide terminated by shorting boards at the both 
ends, as shown in Figure 5.5. Assuming that a standard dipole antenna is in­
stalled inside of a waveguide as a source that excites the electric fields, the field 
distribution inside of the simulator is solved by expanding modes existing in the 
Figure 5.4  Fading measurement using standing waves.

waveguide [10]. With the field distribution regarded as a function of time, the 
phase of each source is randomly changed electronically by a digital phase shift­
er. An eight-bit digital phase shifter is used in order to satisfy the requirement 
that the minimum number of bits should be more than five [11]. The ran­
dom phase variation means that the radiated field from the sources is scanned 
electronically. 
The minimum number of sources is an important parameter for the field 
simulator. Although a single source allows a standing wave to be generated 
inside of a simulator using the reflection waves from the walls, fields varying as 
functions of time require more than one source. The random phase variation 
of two sources produces Rayleigh or Rician fading at the observation point, 
depending on the cumulative probability distribution inside the simulator. As 
shown in Figure 5.6, the calculated probability distributions become nearly 
equal to Rayleigh and Rician curves, which indicate that two sources are ad­
equate for the point of field distribution.
However, the correlation coefficient between the two observation points 
is not small enough for diversity measurement. The correlation coefficient of 
the two-source case is 0.8 when the distance between the observation points 
is 3.5λ. The correlation coefficient for two vertically orientated antennas at a 
mobile terminal in a cellular system is given by (5.11), with the assumption of 
uniform distribution of incoming waves in the horizontal plane [12]:

where d is the distance between two observation points, and J0(x) is the zero or­
der Bessel function. A small correlation coefficient can be obtained using three 
sources. Figure 5.7(a) shows the corresponding calculated histogram of correla­

(5.9), and its histogram is quite similar to the distribution measured using the 
RFM method, as shown in Figure 5.7(b) [13]. The value ρe = 0.1 is calculated 
from the average of this histogram.
Although the size of simulator may be regarded as one of the parameters, 
the number of sources is the dominant factor that characterizes its performance. 
The size of the simulator is determined by the size of the device under test.

5.2.2  Hardware Components for Field Simulators
This section presents examples of hardware components in field simulators. 
The overall arrangement of the field simulator is shown in Figure 5.8; the hand­
set under evaluation is mounted on the board hung from the ceiling. The field 
simulator consists of a cube of 8m3 for measurements with a frequency limit of 
800 MHz. This size will adequately accommodate a human test subject, who 
will manipulate the handset inside the simulator, as shown in Figure 5.9. All of 
the outer walls surrounding the measurement field are consisted of metal, and

Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
three standard dipole antennas are arranged, offset from the source. A block 
diagram of the field simulator is shown in Figure 5.10. The transmit signal 
is distributed from the source to the three antennas with an arbitrary phase 
relationship controlled by a personal computer (PC), and produces a fading 
environment by disturbing the electric field inside the measurement area. 
Fading generators are used to randomly change the phase and produce 
multipass fading, such as Rayleigh and Rician fading independently. Two fad­
ing generators are used to examine the hand effect on the handset terminal by 
receiving the electric fields with a directional antenna turned towards two dif­
ferent base stations. In general, the arrangement uses the base station signal for 
the RF input. However, in this case, a base station simulator is used instead of 
the actual base station. The fading generator consists of an 8-bit digital phase 
shifter to change the antenna phase as a function of time. This simulator can 
also be used to examine the handset for cellular systems with two RF signals 
that have different frequencies. The two RF signals are combined and are input

to the antennas inside the simulator. The variable attenuator inserted in front 
of the fading generator adjusts the level of the transmit RF signals and allows 
the simulation of arbitrary weak- and medium-strength electric fields that cor­
respond to outdoor conditions.
Although an actual base station is used in this example, a base station sim­
ulator is substituted for the open-air antenna part. In this case, the field simula­
tor is considered as only an attenuator in the propagation path and, therefore, 
the system is free from rules and regulations. 
The received electric field strength at the handset under test is picked up 
by a reception dipole antenna installed inside the simulator, as shown in Figure 
5.10. The reporting signals from the handset are: received signal strength indi­
cator (RSSI) level and the number of successful connections.
5.2.3  Measurement Using a Field Simulator
Figure 5.11 shows the cumulative probability distributions measured both in­
side the field simulator and outdoor in the weak electric field strength areas. 
Two examples of outdoor test areas are the suburbs and the countryside, where 
the measured electric field strengths are in the range from 5 dBµ to 15 dBµ. 
The suburban area shown in Figure 5.11 is located at the cell edge in a medi­
um-sized city, and the countryside is located at the cell edge by a lake. Both

measured probability distributions inside the simulator became nearly equal to 
those for outdoor conditions that show the effectiveness of the field simulator 
from the viewpoint of fading distribution. 
The measured number of successful connections in both the field sim­
ulator and the outdoor area are summarized as a percentage success rate in 
Table 5.1. Three handsets used in the cellular system have been evaluated in 
these measurements. The total number of connections was 50 in the outdoor 
measurements and 100 in the field simulator; the number of measurements in 
the outdoor area was limited by the measurement time required. The handset 
antenna was used in the extended position, and the number of successful con­
nections was measured in the paging mode. The difference between the success 
rates for measurements in the outdoor area and in the simulator were less than 
5%, which clearly shows that measurements using the simulator can replace 
outdoor measurement in such a connection test. The measured success rates 
indicate the difference in sensitivity among various handsets.
Next, we present a diversity performance measurement for handsets with 
a whip antenna and a built-in antenna, both using the field simulator. A hand­
set and its antennas are shown in Figure 5.12. The whip antenna is a half-
wavelength sleeve antenna, and the built-in one is a planar inverted-F antenna 
(PIFA) with a notch for impedance matching. This combination of whip anten­
na and PIFA was widely used for reception diversity in handset terminals [14]. 
The diversity performance is evaluated by measuring the cumulative 
probability distribution inside the field simulator; the definition of diversity 
gain is given in Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3. The diversity performance of digital 
cellular terminals is evaluated by amount of improvement in the bit error ratio 
(BER), as described in Section 5.1.2. This measurement is applicable also to 
the field simulator by reporting the BER  from the handset. In this section, an 
example of diversity gain measurement is presented.
Figure 5.13 shows the cumulative probability distribution normalized by 
the median value of the built-in antenna. The fading structure for each antenna 
is very close to Rayleigh distribution, and the diversity gain is about 7 dB with a 
cumulative probability of 1%.  The diversity gain is based on selection diversity. 
In selection diversity, the antenna with the highest power is selected to combine 
the data sequences. The correlation coefficient in this example, calculated using

(5.16), is 0.44. With this antenna arrangement, the diversity gain may be in­
creased by changing the position of the built-in antenna. When the built-in an­
tenna is at the center of the casing, the measured diversity gain is 11 dB and the 
correlation coefficient is –0.35. This antenna location is not realistic because 
the built-in antenna is covered by the hand when in use. However, the diversity 
antenna may be evaluated quantitatively from field simulator measurements.
As the number of mobile terminals (such as Smart Phones) increases as a 
proportion of total digital radio data transmission systems, they are required to 
be evaluated as products before shipping with their antennas. A field simulator 
with a delay spread function meets this requirement. Next we discuss how to 
measure the delay spread.
It is necessary to reproduce the propagation characteristics with delayed 
waves, but the interval of delayed waves in the field simulator is not equal to 
that for actual measured data due to limitations in the size of the simulator. A 
field simulator with a maximum size of 1 to 2m gives delayed waves of the order 
of 10 ns. On the other hand, outdoor delayed waves are of the order of 10 µs, 
which indicates a major difference with those of the simulator. In theoretical 
calculations (assuming a field simulator with perfect conducting walls), electro­
magnetic waves inside are never attenuated and do not result in a delay profile 
whose amplitude decreases with time. In a real field simulator, however, a small 
degree of attenuation is observed at the walls. This is due to the use of imperfect 
conducting material and small gaps at the connection points of the simulator. 
The above attenuation cannot be controlled, and is therefore not appropriate 
when measurements are made to obtain the delay profile.
Figure 5.14 shows the delay profile inside of a simulator that was obtained 
using the ray tracing method, where the simulator parameters are shown in 
Figure 5.8. In this example, the wave absorber covers all of the walls inside the 
simulator, which gives 25 dB absorption for a normal incident plane wave. This 
profile applies to a case with a direct wave, as well as a delayed wave caused by 
reflections from the sidewalls, and is close to the double spike model [15]. Un­
fortunately, the time interval of the delayed waves is determined by the size of 
the simulator and cannot be controlled at will.
As a further example, suppose that the simulator with sidewalls covered 
by an absorber (shown in Figure 5.15) has a delayed profile for which the am­
plitude decreases with time. This decreasing profile is close to the exponential 
function and its component in the horizontal axis is of the order of ns. This 
profile can be regarded as a single spike because the actual delay time is of the 
order of µs. Therefore, this field simulator configuration enables an arbitrary 
delay profile to be obtained by inputting RF signals with time delays into the 
source antennas.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are a key technology for 
the enhancement of communication capacity [16] and have been applied for 
WiMAX, LTE, and wireless LAN (IEEE 802.11n). For wireless LAN, the 
application of MIMO-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-
OFDM) was studied [17, 18] and femtocell MIMO networks have received 
considerable attention for facilitating very high-speed data transmission in in­
door environments [19, 20].

Two major parameters in MIMO systems, such as signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) and correlation, are evaluation factors that will enhance channel capac­
ity. In addition to these parameters, mutual coupling and radiation efficiency 
are measured for handset antennas to evaluate MIMO performance. This sec­
tion presents the theory and technique of MIMO measurement and special 
facilities for indoor MIMO antenna measurement.

where ρ is the averaged SNR at each receiving antenna, Nt and Nr denote the 
number of the transmitting and receiving antennas, and I is an identity matrix. 
Hn is a normalized channel matrix and {•}H represents a complex conjugate 
transpose. The approximation in (5.12) is satisfied when Nr is greater than Nt, 
the channel is not ill-conditioned, and ρ is large. This approximation indicates 
that channel capacity contains elements depending on SNR (CSNR) and correla­
tion (CCOR).
Figure 5.16 shows the channel capacity as a function of SNR for four con­
figurations of antenna elements, where 1,000 patterns of channel matrices are 
examined in each SNR, and the average is used to evaluate the channel capac­
ity. This result indicates that the channel capacity is proportional to the SNR 
when the antena configuration is fixed. To separately evaluate the contribution 
of correlation to channel capacity in (5.12), Figure 5.17 shows CCOR, focusing 
on 2 × 2 MIMO systems. The channel capacity is evaluated by det(HnHnH), 
and is determined by the spatial correlation coefficient γs, which is defined by,

where Rr,ii is the components of Rr = HHH. CCOR values are scattered below 
the upper bound in Figure 5.17, since power distribution to the first and sec­
ond eigenvalues is not optimized. The obtained upper bound curve indicates 
that low correlation provides high channel capacity, with the increasing ratio 

184 
Measurement of Mobile Antenna Systems 
reaching saturation at γs < 0.5. Notably, the upper bound is given by the ideal 
propagation channel. 
Channel capacity in MIMO systems is increased by high SNR and low 
spatial correlation in the propagation channel. To satisfy this requirement, high 
gains with low correlated radiation patterns are required in base station (BS) 
antenna designs. High SNR is achieved by increasing antenna gain and is not 
easy for handset antennas because their available space is limited. Most built-
in antennas are installed at the bottom of the handset to reduce the specific 
absorption ratio (SAR) when phones are held in the “talking” position (if the 
antenna is on top of the handset, close to the subject’s face). For handset anten­
nas, we focus on radiation efficiency and correlation, instead of SNR. 
A reduction in the correlation by minimizing the mutual coupling is ad­
vantageous for small built-in antennas; however, a drawback is small radiation 
efficiency. To determine the relationship between correlation and efficiency,

Mutual coupling also causes a distortion in the radiation pattern, which is 
defined by the ratio between the maximum and minimum gains in the E-plane 
as ∆g = Gmax/Gmin.
The evaluation factors for array spacing d are shown in Figure 5.18. The 
correlation of γd is decreased by minimizing the mutual coupling, which is also 
explained by the observed pattern distortion at values greater than 3 dB in the 
xy-plane. It should be noted that the efficiency, ηr, is decreased as the antenna 
spacing is reduced. 
The reduction of efficiency reduces the channel capacity. In the case of 
2 × 2 MIMO systems, the channel capacity is approximated by the first term 
of (5.11) in a high SNR regime. Thus, the channel capacity, including the ef­
ficiency, is approximated as,

The channel capacity normalized by ηr = 1 (as shown in Figure 5.19) 
is reduced by small efficiency. In small-spacing arrays, the radiation efficiency 
should be carefully considered in the design of handset antennas [23]. In Figure 
5.17, the saturation in capacity increases for ηr < 0.5. The discussion about ef­
ficiency revealed that high radiation efficiency is a key parameter for handset 
antenna design [24].

depicts the block diagrams. On the transmitting side, baseband signals and 
intermediate frequency (IF) signals with the frequency of 10.7 MHz are gener­
ated on the PC. Signals consist of header and data; the header is composed of 
maximum-length sequences (M-sequences). After digital-to-analog (D/A) con­
version and two-staged frequency up-conversion in the transmitter, RF signals 
are simultaneously transmitted from the plural transmit antennas. Hence, the 
mutual couplings between antennas are considered.
On the receiving side, IF signals with the frequency of 8 MHz are obtained 
after a two-staged frequency down-conversion in the receiver and sampling by 
AD converters. They are then brought back to the PC. Timing-synchronization, 
channel estimation, and demodulation are performed with off-line processing. 
The specification of the measurement system is summarized in Table 5.2.
Subsequently, the channel estimation scheme on the receiving side is de­
scribed in Section 5.3.3. In this measurement system, the transmitting frame 
format is constituted by header part using M-sequences and data parts. M-
sequences with 2m-1 bit/period are generated by m stage linear shift register.
Channel responses are estimated by using complex sliding correlation. In 
this scheme, the correlation coefficient (cori) between received and reference 
signals (M-sequences identical to header part) is derived by sliding the refer­
ence signal by one sample. Here, the reference signal is denoted as r, and the 
received signal is extracted to be the same length as reference signals from the 
i-th sample; the sample is denoted by yi, the correlation coefficient between 
those is given by,

In this process, the autocorrelation characteristic is changed rapidly when 
the position of the reference symbol accords with header symbol. Therefore, the 
head of the frame is detected and the channel response is then estimated. Here, 
the peak correlation coefficient and received signal vectors when the peak value 
is achieved are denoted by cor and yp. The transmitted and received signals are 
expressed by the following equation as,

where H is channel response in single-input single-output (SISO). When the 
equation is solved for H by ignoring the noise and multiplying r to both sides

Next, an estimation method of the MIMO channel using 4 × 4 MIMO 
is explained as an example (as shown in Figure 5.21). The header symbol trans­
mitted from each antenna is different and they are not temporally-overlapped. 
On the receiving side are four reference signals that are identical to the header 
transmitted from each transmitting antenna. For example, when complex slid­
ing correlation is applied to y1 using reference signal #1, h11 can be estimated. 
In a similar way, when it is applied to y2, y3, and y4, h21, h31 and h41 can be

estimated. The combinations of received and reference signals required to esti­
mate each channel response are summarized in Figure 5.22.
5.3.3  MIMO Spatial Fading Emulator
A spatial fading emulator based on Clarke’s model [3] and dedicated to the 
performance evaluation of the handset antennas under multipath propagation 
environments was proposed to reproduce artificial fading in an anechoic cham­
ber. It consists of N scatters located on the circumference of the emulator’s ring 
at equal intervals; the amplitude and phase of each wave radiated from scatters 
are controlled by phase shifters and attenuators to emulate a multipath propa­
gation environment, such as a Rayleigh or Rician fading channel in the vicinity 
of its center [30].

Figure 5.23 shows an example of this emulator. N half-wavelength dipole 
antennas used as scatters are fixed on the top of resin pillars that are located on 
the circumference with a radius of r in the same interval. An operator holding 
a handset in a talk or viewer position is located at the center of N-scatters. A 
transmitted wave from a signal generator is separated into N subchannels by a 
power divider, and then radiated from scatters through phase-shifters and atten­
uators. The amplitude and phase of signals radiated from scatters are controlled 
using attenuators and phase-shifters operated by D/A converter to emulate fad­
ing channels. The transmitted signal from the ith scatter is given as:

where ϕ0 is the angle between the first and ith scatter, ϕi is the virtual moving

of each scatter, and the maximum Doppler frequency fD = v/λ is given by the 
mobile speed of operator v and the wavelength of carrier frequency λ. The coor­
dinate system is shown in Figure 5.24. The received signal at the ring center is 
given by (5.23), assuming an omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizon­
tal plane for the handset antenna as [31].

This emulator provides Rayleigh fading based on Clarke’s model and spa­
tial correlation characteristics within a branch separation of 1.7λ for 15 scatters 
with ring radius of r = 10.7λ for the vertical polarization [31].
The single-input single-output (SISO) received signal in (5.23) is extend­
ed to MIMO transmission signals by applying several signals into this emulator. 
The spatial correlation between transmitted signals is controlled by the initial 
phase αi, and a channel response hnm is given for the N handset antennas and 
M base station antennas.

Conversion of dBµV to dBm
The received electric field strength at the antenna input port is measured as a 
voltage Vµ in units of dBµV. The way in which it may be converted to units of 
received power Pr in dBm is described below. 
When the impedances of both the antenna and the receiver input ports 
are matched to Zo, the impedance of the transmission line connecting the an­
tenna and the receiver, Pr, is expressed by V (V) as:

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
The fast Fourier transform (FFT) was originally proposed by Cooley and Tukey 
[1] in 1965 as a fast computation method for Discrete Fourier Transforms 
(DFTs). DFTs find numerous applications in digital signal processing, and 
FFTs enable their implementation. The problem with DFTs is the requirement 
for a large number of computations (e.g., a DFT requires N 2 multiplications to 
transform N discrete values). Thus, a considerable number of computations is 
involved for large values of N, typically in excess of 1,000. The FFT enables the 
number of computations to be drastically reduced. The following is an outline 
of the FFT.
Let {

Therefore, X(k) can be updated by using the above equations recursively.
The figures given below show examples of four-point DFT and FFT pro­
cedures; please note that all the vectors in (a) (for the DFT) are for multiplica­
tions. The computing procedure for the FFT becomes simpler than that for the 
DFT. In fact, the FFT requires only (N/2)log2N multiplications, as opposed to 
N2 for the DFT. This constitutes a considerable saving in computation (e.g., 
the number of multiplications is reduced to less than 1% if N ≥ 512).
