Preface
In the twenty-first century, the topic of waste heat recovery from industrial processes
is taking on an ever-increasing significance. There are essentially two reasons for
this. The first is that there is an obligation to minimise greenhouse gas emissions
and to aim for carbon-neutral operation. The second reason is economic. Waste heat
can represent a huge financial penalty to an industrial process, but implementing
waste heat recovery systems to re-use the energy can substantially reduce thermal
inputs, and hence reduce costs.
This book begins with a study of the classical thermodynamic cycles: Rankine,
organic Rankine, Kalina, and Brayton, on which modern systems for power
generation are based. Accordingly, power plants developed from the Rankine and
the Brayton cycles are used extensively in electricity generation today. However,
these cycles may not be appropriate for future power generation because the
moderate temperatures often associated with waste heat recovery make the organic
Rankine cycle and Kalina cycle unsuitable for consideration in these circumstances.
The second chapter comprises an extensive examination of the many techniques
available for the capture and re-use of waste heat rather than its employment in
power cycles for energy conversion. The topics covered include air preheaters,
regenerators, waste heat boilers, various heat exchanger designs, heat pumps, direct
electrical conversion, and thermal energy storage. The chapter ends with methods
of design development for the aforementioned topics.
The remaining chapters of the book examine the wide-ranging applications
for waste energy utilisation at low temperature, medium temperature, and high
temperature across specific industrial sectors. Some of these applications employ
heat pipes, devices which are highly suitable in many cases for reliable and
economic heat recovery due to their passive nature of operation. The final chapter
closes with high-temperature applications in automotive engineering and aviation.

Thermodynamic Cycles
1.1
Introduction to Thermodynamic Cycles
The concept of a thermodynamic cycle is based on depicting thermodynamic
processes which involve the transfer heat and work. This is achieved by altering
temperature, pressure, as well as other state variables; the cycle ultimately return-
ing to its initial state. The fundamental basis of these cycles is the first law of
thermodynamics which states that ‘energy cannot be created nor destroyed but only
converted from one form to another’.
As shown in Figure 1.1, thermodynamic cycles are split into two primary
classes – refrigeration cycles (also known as heat pump cycles) and power cycles
such as the combustion engine cycle.
Cycles which transfer heat from low temperature to high temperature are classi-
fied as heat pump cycles, whereas cycles that convert heat input into mechanical
work are designated as power cycles. And so, not inappropriately, thermodynamic
power cycles provide the foundation for the operation of a heat engine. Power cycles
are then further divided into groups depending on the type of heat engine. For cycles
modelling internal combustion engines the groups are the Otto, Diesel, and Brayton
cycles and for external combustion engines, they are the Rankine, Organic Rankine,
and Kalina cycles.
1.2
Rankine Cycle
1.2.1
Introduction
The Rankine cycle is a closed thermodynamic cycle that converts thermal energy
into mechanical energy and is based on the fundamentals of the Carnot cycle pro-
posed by the French physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Rankine
cycle was proposed by the Scottish physicist William John Macquorn Rankine in
1865, and contrary to Carnot cycle – which is only a theoretical cycle – the Rankine
cycle has many applications, several of which will be discussed further within this
section.
The main application of the Rankine cycle is to convert thermal energy into
electrical energy and this thermodynamic cycle is based on the rotation of a turbine

fixed to a shaft and on to which an electrical generator is also located. In this
way the mechanical energy of the turbine is converted into electrical energy, a
more versatile and widely used form of energy. Rankine cycles and their different
configurations are extensively used in thermal power plants such as nuclear, gas,
oil, coal, geothermal, biomass, and concentrated solar power plants [1].
This section aims to present and explore in depth the Rankine thermodynamic
cycle and following a general description of the cycle and a reminder of the Carnot
cycle, different configurations will be presented and illustrated by means of diagrams
and schematics. The driver for these various enhanced configurations always being
to improve either the energetic or the exergetic efficiency of the cycle (or both). In
this respect energy is a quantitative parameter and exergy a qualitative parameter,
and we need to measure both of these in order to determine the total useful work
we can extract from a thermodynamic system. The equations used to model such
systems will be highlighted and explained as these formulas help us to understand
the different parameters that influence the overall performance of a system. Real-life
examples will also be used to clarify these explanations, and relevantly, a section of
this document also explores the link between Rankine cycles and thermal power
plants.
1.2.2
Thermodynamic Diagrams
In order to clearly understand the following sections of this document, it is important
to be familiar with the basics of thermodynamics – the first and second laws as well as
thermodynamic diagrams. Indeed, these diagrams are key aids in helping to develop
a deeper understanding about how thermodynamic cycles function. The three main

1.2 Rankine Cycle
3
physical parameters used to describe a thermodynamic system are the temperature
(∘C or K), the pressure (bar or Pa), and volume (m3) and these give rise to three sig-
nificant diagrams which can then be created to visualise the state of a fluid under
specific conditions: the P–V diagram, the T–V diagram, and the P–T diagram. P–V
diagrams plot pressure with respect to specific volume, T–V diagrams plot tempera-
ture with respect to specific volume, and P–T diagrams plot pressure with respect to
temperature. Now as most thermodynamic cycles operate by making use of a phase
change of the working fluid, such diagrams are also useful in that they graphically
display values (of pressure, volume, and temperature) at which these phase changes
occur, i.e. for a given material, the points when changes of state from say a solid to
a liquid (the point of melting), or from a liquid to a gas (the point of vapourisation)
occur – or their reverse processes – freezing and condensing. In fact, we can display
the three parameters of pressure, volume, and temperature as a ‘surface’, Figure 1.2.
Firstly, you will note that we say ‘surface’ not ‘solid’, and that’s because at any
particular temperature and pressure the condition of a material would only lie on
the surface and not above nor below it. For example, take a point for say water in
Figure 1.2, diagram (i), on the vapour section of the diagram. We might try to imagine
a point above this – i.e. one with an increased pressure – but water vapour cannot
exist at this higher pressure at that temperature and volume. Nor will it exist at a
lower pressure. It can only exist at the values of pressure, temperature, and volume
that are shown on the given surface [2].
So, what are the three single-phase regions we can see on the diagrams? They are
the gas/vapour region, the liquid region, and the solid region, and between these we
have the transition or two-state phase change regions where the solids are melting
or freezing, and the liquids are evaporating or condensing.
Now when considering a vapour and a gas, because the two terms are often
confused – and to some extent are synonymous in that they both refer to a physical
state that is not solid or liquid – we perhaps explain the need to differentiate
them. Technically, below the critical temperature, a vapour and its liquid are in

‘equilibrium’ and a vapour can condense back to a liquid with a small change
of pressure or temperature. Whereas a gas cannot condense to a liquid without
changes in both pressure and temperature, and above the critical temperature line
the liquid state does not exist at all! But what do we mean by being ‘in equilibrium’?
Well, evaporation from the surface of a liquid or fluid takes place when the liquid
molecules have enough momentum to overcome the cohesive forces within the fluid
and escape into the space above it. To all intents and purposes, it becomes a gas, but
because both the liquid and gas are present together it is more accurately known
(in this state) as a vapour. If we now add heat to the liquid the momentum of the
molecules increases, and more liquid evaporates. Similarly, a reduction in pressure
above the liquid also reduces the momentum necessary for molecules to escape and
so again evaporation is increased. But if the container which holds the liquid is sealed
so that the evaporated vapour cannot escape, then the amount of liquid that can
evaporate is finite. That is at any fixed value of temperature and pressure the amount
of vapour will rise to a steady fixed amount and then no more can be added and the
vapour is said to be ‘fully saturated’. If any more molecules reach sufficient momen-
tum to escape the surface then their number is exactly matched by those condensing
back into the liquid, so an equilibrium or balance occurs between the two processes
to limit the amount of vapour – or more correctly – the vapour pressure. Raise the
temperature and the amount of vapour that can be maintained increases, and the
‘fully saturated’ line – the dome or bell-shaped line (in the earlier diagrams) illus-
trates the limit of this. So, to the right-hand side of the curve is where all the liquid
will have evaporated and the liquid state cannot exist, whilst the left-hand side shows
where all the solid has melted to liquid and the solid state can now longer exist. But
under the curve is the region where both liquid and vapour exist together. Until that
is, we reach the peak or ‘critical point’ or critical state where the distinction between
the liquid and the gas no longer exists. Here the molecules are evaporating so rapidly
that the density of the liquid and the vapour are equal and produce a ‘supercritical
fluid’; the point being that condensation of the gas will never occur above the critical
point no matter how much pressure we apply.
But what else does the P–V–T diagram show us? For example, if we look at the
liquid and solid regions, we will notice just how steep these surfaces are, and that’s
because, compared to gases, liquids and certainly solids are much harder to com-
press. So, at a particular temperature, if we increase the pressure it does not really
change the volume or, conversely, the pressure will rise dramatically for a small
change in volume. We can also note the transition phase between a solid and a
vapour where ‘sublimation’ can occur. Dry ice is an example of such a material and
is used where it is necessary to keep items cold but where any packaging will not
get wet with liquid as the ‘dry’ ice warms up. We can also notice the triple state line
where all three phases can coexist.
However, as useful as the P–V–T surface plot is to indicate the various states and
transition phases of a substance they are a bit difficult to read-off from on to value
scales. So, it is more usual to present thermodynamic information by means of
two-axis diagrams that we briefly noted earlier. For example, the P–V diagram is the

view we would obtain by looking at the surface from a pressure–volume perspective
to see how a thermodynamic process changes with pressure and volume, Figure 1.3.
Usually we are only interested in the saturated liquid and saturated vapour areas,
so our P–V diagrams are often ‘truncated’. But in addition, our volume axis is more
usually scaled in terms of specific volume, i.e. the cubic volume per kilogram of mass
rather than just volume, because then, as an intensive property, the value does not
depend on the size of the thermodynamic system. Hence, as we can see in Figure 1.4,
the P–V diagram (also called a Clapeyron diagram) presents pressure as a function
of the specific volume (m3/kg), and on this diagram the left-hand side of the vapour
dome shows the limit between the liquid region whilst the right-hand side shows
the limit between the liquid/vapour region and the superheated vapour region. The
diagram also denotes the plot of two isothermal lines or lines of constant temperature
demonstrating that, inside the dome, the phase transition between liquid and vapour
is a constant-pressure, constant-temperature process.
The other two diagrams that we can better visualise as two-dimensional graphs
are the temperature–volume and the pressure–temperature diagrams as shown in
Figure 1.5.

The vapour dome can also be seen on the T–V diagram in Figure 1.6, however,
it is not directly visible on the P–T diagram in Figure 1.7 – which is also known
as a phase diagram – in that for a given pressure and temperature the state of the
substance is fully defined. As phase transitions occur under constant pressure and
temperature for pure substances, alteration of the pressure or temperature will result
in a phase change for the substance, the outcome being either a pure liquid or a pure
vapour. For that reason, the liquid–vapour region is just a line on the P–T diagram
and the vapour dome is not visible because, as we have already seen, a third dimen-
sion (the P–V–T diagram) is required to fully visualise the state of the fluid.
Two other thermodynamic variables are also very useful in describing a thermo-
dynamic system from energetic and exergetic viewpoints, and these are the specific
enthalpy h (kJ/kg) and the specific entropy s (kJ/kg K). Enthalpy (h) measures the
total heat content of a system and is equal to the internal energy (i.e. the energy
related to the molecular structure or state of the material and the degree of molecular
activity) which is then added to the product of pressure and volume. In the analy-
sis of systems that involve fluid flow, we often meet the combination of these two
properties, defined from h = u + PV, where u represents the macroscopic energy of
the non-flowing fluid and PV represents the energy needed to push and maintain the
fluid flow around the system. But the second term, entropy, is defined as a measure of
randomness of molecules, so what, we may ask, is its relevance to thermodynamics?

In fact, entropy is very relevant to thermodynamics and is the function of the
quantity of heat that can be converted into work – and yes, it still does indicate
the randomness of molecules. For example, suppose we put 100 J of energy into
a system trying to convert this all into work can we then get 100 J back out? The
answer of course is No! Some of that energy will be used in making more molecules
move at random or increasing the momentum of those already in motion – that’s
why the entropy of a solid is less than that of a gas because gases have more
molecules moving at random. Temperature increases the entropy of a material
because as the temperature rises, the molecules spread out and take up more
room – that is, they become more disordered. Pressure, on the other hand, has the
opposite effect, it forces molecules closer together, so they become more ordered
and entropy decreases. However, we should note that solids and liquids are nearly
incompressible, so any entropy decrease is minimal.
So, in addition to those already mentioned, many other two- and three-
dimensional diagrams can be plotted. For example, the T–s diagram (temperature as
a function of specific entropy) and the P–h diagram (pressure as a function of spe-
cific enthalpy) are both very useful diagrams. An example of a temperature-specific
entropy (T–s) diagram can be seen in Figure 1.8, and is often used to describe
thermodynamic power cycles since the area drawn by the cycle on this form of
diagram is equal to the work provided by it. Alternatively, a pressure–enthalpy
(P–h) diagram, also called a Mollier diagram, might be used, as shown in Figure 1.9,
to help describe receptor cycles such as refrigeration cycles.
These diagrams are also essential tools to aid understanding and for describing
thermodynamic cycles, but in most cases when working with Rankine cycles the

that follow.
1.2.3
The Carnot Cycle
Before we discuss the Rankine cycle and its application, we first need to consider its
inspiration – the Carnot cycle [5].
Nicholas Léonard Sadi Carnot, the French mechanical engineer and physicist, is
often described as the ‘father of thermodynamics’. He published only one book, but
in it he expressed the first successful theory of maximum heat engine efficiency and
so laid the foundations, for what was then, an entirely new discipline. The Carnot
cycle is therefore used as the common reference for every thermodynamic power
cycle because even though the Carnot cycle is only a theoretical model, it does pro-
vide the standard as the most efficient engine possible. In other words, because the
thermal efficiency of the Carnot cycle only depends on the absolute temperatures
of the two heat reservoirs that drive the process, it gives us the upper limit of both
energetic and exergetic thermodynamic cycle efficiency [6].
Most commonly, the working fluid used to explain the Carnot cycle is water and
the cycle is divided into four phases as shown in Figure 1.10:
1. Isothermal expansion, (AB)
2. Isentropic (constant entropy) expansion, (BC)
3. Isothermal (constant temperature) compression, (CD)
4. Isentropic (constant entropy) compression, (DA)
Theoretically, these four processes are reversible, but in reality, reversible transfor-
mations do not exist because of, e.g. heat losses due to friction. The figure indicates
a clockwise cycle and so is known as a Carnot ‘power’ cycle (power cycles are those
which convert heat into mechanical work output whilst a ‘heat pump’ cycle transfers
heat from lower to higher temperatures using mechanical work input).
Thermodynamic power cycles are the operating basis of heat engines, which cur-
rently supply much of the world’s electric power and run almost all motor vehicles.

1.2 Rankine Cycle
11
Power cycles are classified according to the type of heat engine they model, e.g. we
have the Otto cycle and the Diesel cycle for modelling internal combustion engines,
the Brayton cycle for modelling gas turbines, and the Rankine cycle for modelling
steam turbines.
Consider for a moment, the above T–s diagram as representing the Carnot cycle
for an ideal or perfect gas turbine, i.e. one with no friction and the necessary heat
transfers occurring without loss. What do the four stages of our cycle represent?
Essentially, we start with two ‘heat reservoirs’ with temperatures T1 and T2,
respectively, and these have such a large thermal capacity that their temperatures
are stable and unaffected by the cycle, which takes place as follows:
●Stage 1 (AB): Heat is transferred from the high-temperature reservoir (T1) at con-
stant temperature. During this phase, the entropy of the gas is increased by allow-
ing it to expand and reduce its pressure and in doing so producing work on the
surroundings – e.g. moving a piston or rotating a shaft within a turbine.
●Stage 2 (BC): During this stage of the cycle, it is assumed that the gas is thermally
insulated from both the hot and cold reservoirs, so that they neither gain nor lose
heat from the gas – i.e. the conditions are adiabatic (Greek ≡without loss). Instead,
the gas continues to expand (and do more work) further reducing the pressure
and losing internal energy in an amount equal to the work done. Since this gas
expansion occurs without any heat input, it cools to the ‘cold’ temperature T2 but
with the entropy unchanged.
●Stage 3 (CD): At this point the gas in now in thermal contact with the cold reservoir
at temperature T2, and work is then done on the gas to compress it – e.g. the piston
is forced down or the gas passes into a compressor. In doing so, heat energy is
transferred to the cold reservoir and the entropy of the system decreases by the
same amount that it gained at Stage 1.
●Stage 4 (DA): It is assumed that the gas is thermally isolated from the hot and cold
reservoirs (and any mechanical processes are frictionless) and further compres-
sion takes place, increasing the internal energy and so causing the temperature to
rise back to T1. This assumes that this temperature rise is solely due to the work
added to the system and so the entropy remains unchanged. The gas is now back
at the same state as the start of Stage 1.
As such, the work (kJ) provided by the thermodynamic cycle is given by:
W = ∮PdV = ∮TdS
(1.1)
In other words, the total work is given by integrating and thereby accumulating
all the infinitesimally small changes in volume and pressure or entropy and temper-
ature the gas makes on its journey around the cycle. Of course, the path taken by a
real process differs somewhat from the ideal processes shown, but the idea here is
to produce a perfect standard against which all other heat engines can be judged.
In a T–s diagram, the area under the upper portion of the figure represents the
thermal energy absorbed during the cycle, whilst the area under the lower portion
represents the thermal energy removed during the cycle – hence the area inside

12
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
the cycle will represent the difference between these two. However, since the inter-
nal energy of the system must return to its initial value, this difference must also
represent the total amount of work performed by the system over one cycle. So, in
definitive terms on the diagram, the absolute value of all this work (|W|) corresponds
to the area of the rectangle. Or:
|W| = (T1 −T2) ⋅(SB −SA)
(1.2)
If QH represents the total amount of thermal energy transferred from the hot reser-
voir to the system (kJ), and QC represents the total amount of thermal energy trans-
ferred from the system to the cold reservoir (kJ), both as given by Eqs. (1.3)–(1.5):
QH = T1 ⋅(SB −SA) and QC = T2 ⋅(SB −SA)
(1.3)
Then the efficiency of the Carnot cycle can be defined as:
𝜂= |W|
QH
= QH −QC
QH
= (T1 −T2) ⋅(SB −SA)
T1 ⋅(SB −SA)
(1.4)
where, T1 is the hot source temperature and T2 is the cold source temperature (both
are expressed in [K] Kelvin), and SB and SA correspond, respectively, to the entropy
(kJ/K) at points B and A. From which, the overall efficiency will be given by the
following equation:
𝜂= T1 −T2
T1
= 1 −T2
T1
(1.5)
1.2.4
Ideal and Actual Rankine Cycles
The Carnot cycle is just a theoretical cycle. It is not possible to build a real engine
working under such conditions because of real component irreversibility. For
example, the transformations result in heat dissipation through friction. So, these
transformations are defined as irreversible because once they have occurred, it is
impossible to return them to their initial state. A reversible transformation is a
succession of infinitesimal changes, each occurring without any energy loss, and in
practice, this kind of transformation does not exist in the real world even though
each component is designed in order to approach an irreversible behaviour.
The Rankine cycle is very similar to the Carnot cycle, the difference being that the
reversible isothermal transformations are now replaced by isobaric (constant pres-
sure) ones. In most cases, the working fluid is water too.
The ideal Rankine cycle is composed of two isobaric transformations and two
adiabatic and reversible isentropic (constant entropy) transformations as shown in
Figure 1.11. The four main components required for the Rankine cycle are a pump,
a boiler, a turbine, and a condenser as shown in Figure 1.12.
The four transformations involved in the cycle are:
●1–2: Isentropic compression (pump). The fluid (in liquid state) is compressed
while the specific entropy remains constant.

the specific entropy again remains constant.

fluid is cooled down under constant pressure and the vapour condenses.
1.2.4.1
Ideal Cycle
To describe the Rankine thermodynamic cycle, five physical variables are required:
1. The pressure P (Pa)
2. The temperature T (K)

14
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
3. The steam quality x, which represents the proportion of saturated vapour in a
liquid/vapour mixture.
x =
mvapour
mvapour + mliquid
(1.6)
where, mvapour and mliquid correspond, respectively, to the masses (kg) of the
vapour and liquid contained in the mixture. (For example, at point number 1 on
the T-s diagram, x(1) = 0, i.e. the fluid is a fully saturated liquid.)
4. The specific enthalpy of the fluid h (kJ/kg)
5. The specific entropy of the fluid s (kJ/kg K)
Knowing the values of each of these variables at every point of the diagram is very
useful, and helpfully the five variables are linked to each other through physical
relationships.
Looking at the diagram it may not be obvious, but the cycle is divided in two
pressure areas: high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) – these pressures being
expressed in Pascal (Pa). Points 2 and 3 are in the HP section and points 4 and 1 are
in the LP section, and as the transformation between 2 and 3 is isobaric: P2 = P3.
(And similarly, for the same reason, P1 = P4.) Then the work provided to the system
corresponds to the area of the quadrilateral shape drawn by the four points, but to
calculate this work, the specific enthalpy of the fluid must be used. From which we
can then determine the specific work (𝜔) – which corresponds to the amount of work
delivered per unit of mass (kJ/kg).
The thermodynamic system is exchanging energy (work or heat) with its environ-
ment, and we should note here the convention that: heat transferred to a fluid is a
positive quantity; heat transferred from a fluid is a negative quantity. It is necessary
to note this because a Rankine cycle uses part of its work to compress the water,
so will need to deduct the power put into the pump from the power output of the
turbine in order to obtain the net work. Accordingly, the required work and heat
parameters are determined from:
𝜔turb, the work given by the fluid to the turbine (kJ/kg). It is negative as the fluid is
giving work:
𝜔turb = h4 −h3
(1.7)
𝜔pump, the work given by the pump to the fluid (kJ/kg). It is positive as the pump
gives work to the fluid:
𝜔pump = h2 −h1
(1.8)
qin, the heat given by the boiler to the fluid (kJ/kg). It is positive as the boiler gives
heat to the fluid:
qin = h3 −h2
(1.9)
qout, the heat given by the fluid to the condenser (kJ/kg). It is negative as the fluid
rejects heat:
qout = h1 −h4
(1.10)

1.2 Rankine Cycle
15
So, as the net work (𝜔net) (kJ/kg) provided by the cycle is governed by:
𝜔net = 𝜔turb + 𝜔pump
(1.11)
Then the thermal efficiency (𝜂th) of the ideal Rankine cycle can be defined by:
𝜂th = |𝜔turb|
qin
(1.12)
And hence the overall efficiency (𝜂) of the ideal Rankine cycle can be defined by:
𝜂= |𝜔net|
qin
=
|𝜔turb| −𝜔pump
qin
(1.13)
Substituting Eqs. (1.4)–(1.6) then leads to:
𝜂= |h4 −h3| −(h2 −h1)
h3 −h2
= h3 −h4 −(h2 −h1)
h3 −h2
(1.14)
In practice however, compared to the output of the turbine, the work input to the
pump is very small. In which case, if 𝜔pump can be neglected compared to the other
coefficients, we arrive at the useful approximation of:
𝜂≈h3 −h4
h3 −h2
(1.15)
So to estimate the efficiency of the system, we can also use the first law of thermo-
dynamics which states that the net energy of a system is equal to 0, i.e.
𝜔turb + 𝜔pump + qin + qout = 0
(1.16)
And further assuming 𝜔pump is neglectable compared to the other coefficients
gives:
|𝜔turb| ≈qin −|qout|
(1.17)
From which the efficiency of the ideal Rankine cycle can now be estimated from
the following formula:
𝜂≈|𝜔turb|
qin
≈qin −|qout|
qin
= 1 −|qout|
qin
(1.18)
Practically the efficiency of the ideal Rankine cycle is necessarily lower than the
efficiency of the theoretical Carnot cycle even using the same hot and cold sources.
In addition, the cycle presented in this section is still an ideal cycle, and the actual
cycle used, for instance, for power plant analysis is slightly different.
1.2.4.2
Superheated Rankine Cycle
In the conventional Rankine cycle, the isentropic expansion occurs in the wet steam
domain (transformation 3–4 in Figure 1.11). To explain, when a boiler heats water,
bubbles breaking through the water surface pull tiny droplets of water into the steam
which then becomes partially wet (‘wet steam’) from the added liquid. As water is
the working fluid, it can cause damage to the turbine due to corrosion. Therefore,
to mitigate this in power plants, the vapour is superheated to remove any moisture
that it contains. Steam dryness is important because it has a direct effect on the total

amount of transferable energy contained within the steam. For example, saturated
steam (100% dry) contains 100% of the latent heat available at that pressure.
The result of this can be seen in the shape variation for the T–s diagram of the
cycle as shown in Figure 1.13. In this case, the cycle is still a Rankine cycle and is
sometimes called Hirn (or Rankine with superheating) cycle, so one extra compo-
nent is required: the superheater as shown in Figure 1.14. However, in most cases,
the boiler and the superheater are the same component.
Overheating is also interesting because it increases the amount of work given to
the turbine. As we can see on the T–s diagram, the area of the superheated cycle
is bigger than the area of the classical Rankine cycle. And in this way, for a same
power output, the water flow rate can be lower for the Rankine–Hirn cycle than for
a classical Rankine cycle, so improving the energetic efficiency of the system. Unfor-
tunately, superheating also increases the irreversibility of the cycle and therefore,
correspondingly, the exergetic efficiency of the system is regrettably reduced.
The main difference between the two cycles is that the heat given to the fluid by
the boiler/superheater enhances the superheated cycle. On the T–s diagram, this

1.2 Rankine Cycle
17
extra heat addition corresponds to the transformation 3–3′. This way, the expansion
of the fluid then occurs within a superheated steam domain and corresponds to the
transformation 3′–4 on the diagram. Furthermore, this transformation is assumed
to display a greater degree of isentropic change and so is shown as a vertical line on
the diagram, contrary to the transformation we now see between 1 and 2.
The efficiency of the superheated cycle is given by the same equation as the
classical Rankine cycle (Eqs. (1.13) and (1.14)) – the difference being in the position
of point 3′ (instead of 3), i.e.
𝜂=

3 −h4 −(h2 −h1)

(1.19)
1.2.4.3
Actual Rankine Cycle
The actual Rankine cycle is the best cycle with which to model the transformations
occurring within a power plant as it is the one which takes both system irreversibility
and system imperfections into consideration.
In this cycle, friction caused by the moving fluid induces pressure losses or heat
loss, and as a result the isobaric transformations described in the ideal Rankine cycle
are not exactly isobaric in the actual cycle. Pressure drops in the condenser and in
the turbine reduce the area of the cycle, as shown on the T–s diagram in Figure 1.15.
Hence, the specific work of the cycle is lower for the actual cycle than for the ideal
cycle. Furthermore, the isentropic transformations described in the ideal cycle are
not reversible, as they are in the actual cycle: irreversibility deteriorates the perfor-
mances of the pump and of the turbine. Hence, the exergetic efficiency is reduced.

1 Thermodynamic Cycles
In thermodynamics, reversibility defines the best theoretical work process, i.e. as
the name suggests, one which can proceed in both the forward and the reverse direc-
tions – but with the key point that the system and its parameters are returned to their
initial states at the end of the reverse process. Irreversibility is a concept that recog-
nises that processes are not perfect, losses occur, and in thermodynamics these are
quantified by:
●The difference between the work output (or input) of a reversible process and the
actual work process
●The entropy a system generates during a process.
Fortunately, the efficiency of the cycle can be given by the same expression as the
ideal Rankine cycle (Eq. (1.14)). However, the values of the specific enthalpy are not
the same as those in the ideal Rankine cycle.
To make comparisons between the compression and expansion transformations of
an actual cycle to the isentropic transformations of the ideal cycle, an isentropic effi-
ciency needs to be introduced and this comes within the term the adiabatic efficiency,
and a series exists to define isentropic efficiencies for turbines, compressors, and
nozzles. For instance, the isentropic efficiency of the expansion transformation in
the turbine is defined as follows:
𝜂i,turb =
Energy given to the turbine with the actual transformation
Energy given to the turbine with the isentropic transformation
(1.20)
As an example, Figure 1.16 compares the actual and the isentropic expansion of
the vapour in a turbine on a h–s diagram, and to accommodate the difference, an
adaption is made to Eq. (1.20) in order to express this adiabatic efficiency using spe-
cific enthalpy as follows: If we start by assuming that vapour is an ideal gas, then it
is possible to calculate the pressure, temperature, enthalpy, and entropy of the fluid
using the Laplace’s equation:
P1−𝛾⋅T𝛾= Constant
(1.21)
In this equation, 𝛾is the heat capacity ratio, a dimensionless coefficient.
Knowing the temperature and pressure values at the inlet and the pressure at the
outlet of the turbine, it is then possible to calculate the temperature value that would
be reached if the transformation was truly isentropic. Then once T2s is calculated,
and h1, h2a, and h2s deduced from thermodynamic tables, the adiabatic efficiency
of the turbine can be calculated. The isentropic efficiency of the pump is often also
used to take the irreversibilities of the pump into consideration.
It is given by the following equation:
𝜂i,pump = Isentropic pump work
Actual pump work
(1.22)
And the process starts by assuming the water is incompressible, which then
leads to:
Isentropic pump work = Δh = V ⋅ΔP

In this equation, V is the specific volume of water (m3/kg). It is constant along the
transformation if the fluid is supposed incompressible. The pressure difference,ΔP,
is expressed in Pascal (Pa). Again, knowing the actual inlet and outlet tempera-
tures/pressures of the pump, it is possible to calculate the actual pump work, and
this corresponds to the variation of enthalpy. All from which the isentropic efficiency
of the pump can be deduced.
So, when using equations for the ideal cycle, it is important to be aware of the real
efficiencies for all the components. For example, the turbine and the pump both also
have a mechanical efficiency. All these imperfections will be described in depth in
the power plant section so that we can better express the real link between the heat
input and the electricity output produced by a plant.
1.2.4.4
Improvements to the Rankine Cycle
The Hirn cycle has a greater efficiency than the Rankine cycle and this is expected
since the expression for Carnot’s efficiency (Eq. (1.5)) illustrates that the higher the
hot source temperature, the greater the efficiency. It is also true for the Rankine cycle
(Eq. (1.18)).
Therefore, increasing the temperature of the hot source is a way of improving the
efficiency of the Rankine cycle, but it also results in an increase in the boiler pressure.
In the past, the boiler pressures were limited because of the materials used [7]. Over
time however, the upper limit on boiler pressure rose and currently, with advances in
metallurgy, it is possible to go over the critical pressure of water (220.6 bar) and some
coal-fired power plants today are operating with boiler pressures around 300 bar.
Moreover, other improvements can also be made to improve the efficiency of the
cycle, and these main improvements are presented within this section.

Effects of decreasing the LP on the Rankine cycle.
Decreasing the LP As we have noted, on our diagrams the lines drawn between the
different points of the cycle represent thermodynamic processes and furthermore,
the area enclosed by these lines corresponds to work provided by the system. This
means that trying to increase the amount of work given by the system is the graphical
equivalent to expanding this area, and one way to achieve this is to decrease the pres-
sure of the system. As we can see, the lower the pressure, the lower the bottom line
(condensation phase) of the cycle, i.e. the area of the cycle is increased (Figure 1.17).
In addition, if the pressure decreases, it leads to an increase in net work compared
to the increase in heat input (𝛥𝜔net > 𝛥qin), then the efficiency of the system will also
increase. However, as we see in Figure 1.17, decreasing the pressure of the system
can result in introducing lower quality steam into the turbine, i.e. we run the risk or
moving back into the wet steam domain – the further the point is from the saturated
vapour curve, the lower the steam quality. Low steam quality can result in turbine
deterioration due to corrosion and a subsequent decrease in mechanical efficiency.
Hence, the pressure of the Rankine cycle must be set as low as possible in order to
improve the energetic efficiency of the system – but not too low to still ensure a high
steam quality.
Increasing the HP We might therefore conclude that increasing the pressure will also
have a beneficial effect, but increasing the pressure actually keeps the work of the
cycle roughly steady. Figure 1.18 shows the effect of this increase on a T–s diagram.
Helpfully, the area of the cycle increases on the top part of the cycle (area shaded
on the diagram) but unfortunately, it then also decreases on the right part of it (area
shaded on the diagram) so the net gain is very small. Nonetheless, as the average
temperature of the hot source increases, so increasing the pressure of the cycle has a
positive effect on the cycle’s efficiency. However, this increase then leads to a lower
steam quality at the end of the expansion phase (point 4) which, as we have seen,
can affect turbine operation.

Effects of increasing the HP on the Rankine cycle.
To sum up, both the HP and the LP values must be carefully chosen so as to ensure
that we achieve the highest possible energetic efficiency whilst still ensuring that we
maintain high steam quality at the end of the expansion phase. Of course, it does not
help that with modern plants, the LP and HP can vary as functions of time. But by
using controllers which adjust these values (LP; HP) by taking into account exter-
nal condition – such as outside temperature and pressure – we can ensure optimal
performance.
Rankine Cycles with Reheat As we have seen, steam quality is a very important factor
in the Rankine cycle. So, in order to avoid low steam quality at the end of the expan-
sion phase, reheat cycles were introduced in the first part of the twentieth century.
This category of cycle also involves having two turbines positioned on the same shaft
as shown in Figure 1.19. The first turbine allows the expansion of the steam com-
ing from the superheater from HP to a medium pressure (MP) (Figure 1.20), and
this steam is then reheated and expanded in the second turbine from MP to LP. The
main advantage of the reheat is to increase the steam quality to ensure a steadier
thermodynamic efficiency.
Rankine cycles with reheat also ensure a higher overall mechanical efficiency by
using two turbines for the cycle compared to only using one. In this configuration,
the overall efficiency of the cycle is given by:
𝜂=
|𝜔turb1| + |𝜔turb2| −𝜔pump

(1.24)
where, qinB corresponds to the heat (kJ/kg) provided by the boiler to the fluid and
qinR corresponds to the heat (kJ/kg) provided by the reheater to the fluid (In real-life
power plant, the boiler and the superheater use the same heat source.)

Regenerative Rankine Cycles
To improve energetic and exergetic efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle, the regen-
erative Rankine cycles extracts a portion of the steam from the turbine to heat the
fluid before it is sent to the boiler. This results in a small reduction in the work pro-
vided to the turbine but a substantial reduction in the heat input, because the heating
phase creates entropy and thus irreversibility if this is all provided by the boiler. The
portion of steam used therefore helps the boiler heat the fluid, reducing the fuel
required by the boiler and hence both energetic and exergetic efficiencies improve.
Furthermore, the average temperature of the heat input by the boiler is increased
and this also results in a higher energetic efficiency [8].
Regenerative cycles require a new component. A feed water heater (FWH) also
called a regenerator is required, its role being to heat the feed water before it enters
the boiler. There are two different kinds of regenerative cycle: the open FWH cycle
and the closed FWH cycle.
Open FWH cycles use an Open FWH. As seen in Figure 1.21, this component
mixes the liquid delivered from pump 1 with the extracted steam arriving from
turbine. It corresponds to point 6 on the T–s diagram shown in Figure 1.22.

As the mixing takes place at MP, pump 1 is only required to compress the fluid
from LP to MP. Hence, after this mixing phase, a second pump is then required
to increase the pressure to HP. This second compression phase corresponds to the
transformation 6–7 on the T–s diagram (Figure 1.21).
Now if y represents the mass proportion of steam extracted from the compressor,
and:
y = ̇m(2 →6)
̇m(1 →2)
(1.25)
where ̇m (2 →6) corresponds to the mass flow rate (kg/s) between points 2 and 6,
and ̇m(1 →2) corresponds to the mass flow rate between points 1 and 2.
Then the overall efficiency of the open FWH cycle is given by:
𝜂=
|𝜔turb| −𝜔pumps
qinB
= (h1 −h2) + (1 −y)(h2 −h3) −(1 −y)(h5 −h4) −(h7 −h6)
h1 −h7
(1.26)

24
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
This efficiency is always greater than the efficiency of the ideal Rankine cycle given
in Eq. (1.14). Indeed, the greater the number of regenerators, the higher the cycle
efficiency.
So, writing the energy balance of the open FWH leads to:
y ⋅h2 + (1 −y) ⋅h5 = h6
(1.27)
Now the open FWH requires two pumps: one at its inlet and one at its outlet, but
to avoid this multiplication of pumps in a power plant, it is possible to use a closed
FWH. Moreover, closed FWHs are more reversible than open ones.
A closed FWH has the same role as the open, but there is no mixing of the extracted
steam with the feed water. This way the extracted steam and the feed water can have
different pressures, the FWH then operating as a shell and tube heat exchanger. It is
more expensive and complex than an open FWH, but requires less area and mainte-
nance is reduced because of the lower number of pumps.
In the closed FWH system the extracted steam is cooled and turned into conden-
sate and two options are available to reinject this condensate in to the cycle as shown
Figures 1.23 and 1.24.
The ‘drain cascaded backward’ technology is the cheapest way to reinject the con-
densate, and with this configuration a steam trap is first used to reduce the pressure
from MP to LP, which then reintroduces the condensate to the condenser as shown
in Figures 1.25 and 1.26. However, the overall adiabatic efficiency of a steam trap is
lower than the average efficiency of a pump, so the drain pump forward technology
offers better performance. In fact, in the steam trap, because the pressure drops sud-
denly, exergy is destroyed and so is not reversible. On the other hand, in the pump
(of the pump forward technology), the pressure of the fluid is increased more slowly
resulting in a process more closely resembling a reversible process and resulting in
less exergy reduction.
Reiterating, the drain pumped forward technology is more expensive and requires
more maintenance. In the configuration, a pump is used to increase the condensate

pressure from MP to HP, and then the condensate is mixed with the feed water in a
mixing chamber, as shown in Figure 1.27. However, this process does produce higher
energetic and exergetic efficiencies because the pump creates less irreversibility than
a steam trap.
In a closed FWH (using the same notations as Figure 1.27), the energy balance
leads to:
y ⋅(h2 −h7) = (1 −y) ⋅(h6 −h5)
(1.28)
This expression for the efficiency of the closed FWH cycle is the same as the expres-
sion for the efficiency of an open FWH. However (in Figure 1.27 for example), the
benefit of the closed FWH is that the specific energy given by the boiler (qin) is equal

to h1 −h9. Without it, the specific energy would have been h1 −h5, and since h5 < h9,
qin is reduced with a closed FWH.
Regenerative Rankine cycles are widely used in electrical power plants – the num-
ber of FWH systems varying from 6 to 10 and, in most of the cases, both open and
closed FWH configurations can be used in the same plant.
1.2.4.6
Cogeneration
Cogeneration is the generation of two types of energy using only one source of pri-
mary energy. In most cases, cogeneration processes produce both electrical and ther-
mal energies and so cogeneration is also known as combined heat and power (CHP).
The aim of a Rankine cycle-based power plant is to create electrical energy
through the rotation of a steam turbine. However, in the process we also waste a lot
of heat. Cogeneration offers a solution to utilise the thermal energy of this waste
heat, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the whole process. In Europe in
2011, 11% of heat and electricity requirements were produced with cogeneration
plants [9].
Here is an example to better understand the benefits of cogeneration. To produce
350 kW electrical (kWe) and 530 kW thermal (kWth), a cogeneration power plant
with an electrical efficiency (Eq. (1.29)) of 35% and a thermal efficiency (Eq. (1.30))
of 53% would use 1000 kW of primary energy. By comparison, a high efficiency
power plant, such as a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, with
an efficiency of 55% combined with a high efficiency boiler at an efficiency of
90% would require 1225 kW of primary energy [10]. Hence, in this example, the
CHP cogeneration power plant saves 18% of the primary energy in comparison to
the separate production of heat and electricity. The benefits of cogeneration are
therefore: energetic, economic, and environmental.

where, Pelec is the electrical power output, Pthermal is the thermal power output, and
Pin is the total power input (kW). In this example, the overall efficiency of the cogen-
eration plant is 88% whereas the overall efficiency of the conventional system is 72%.
Furthermore, the overall system efficiency is further reduced during the delivery of
this conventional electrical power owing to approximately 10% (or more) power loss
in transmission.
In its general application therefore, Figure 1.28 illustrates why cogeneration is a
better solution than conventional systems for producing both heat and electricity.
Notwithstanding other advantages, the average overall efficiency of a cogeneration
plant is higher than the average overall efficiency of a conventional system.
The efficiency of a cogeneration power plant is given by:
𝜂cogen = Pelec + Pthermal
Pin
(1.31)
Although cogeneration power plants can use fossil fuel or uranium as their com-
bustible, it is also possible to use renewable forms of energy such as solar, biomass,
or geothermal.
The main disadvantages of a cogeneration power plant are that: (i) the pro-
duction of electrical energy involves the production of a large quantity of thermal
energy – which is sometimes difficult to use – and (ii) electrical energy is much more
versatile in comparison with thermal energy. Common ways to harness the thermal
energy produced by cogeneration plant is to use it for industrial applications or
for district heating, e.g. through a heat network [11], but other applications are
also practical such as using the heat to warm the water of a swimming pool. It is

28
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
also possible to use a portion of the thermal heat output to produce cooling energy
through a sorption chiller, this process being called trigeneration [12].
A cogeneration Rankine cycle requires a heat exchanger to recover heat from the
fluid and in one of several possible cogeneration configurations, heat is recovered
directly from the condenser – in which case, the cogeneration plant is operating as
a back pressure plant. The temperature of the heating stream is directly linked to
the pressure of the fluid within the condenser, this pressure being controlled by a
valve. The higher the pressure of the condenser, the higher the temperature of the
heating stream. However, we must be careful because the higher the pressure within
the condenser, the lower the efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle.
So, to avoid influencing the LP of the cycle, it is also possible to extract a fraction (y)
of the steam coming from the turbine to add heat to the heating stream. In this case,
the heat recovery does not influence the LP of the system. Unfortunately, as the mass
flow rate in the turbine is reduced, the work delivered by the fluid to the turbine is
also reduced. As the fraction extracted is controlled with a valve, different heating
needs can be met by varying this. Figure 1.29 is a schematic of this kind of cycle.
Point 6 in the figure is the mixing chamber.
Figure 1.30 represents the T–s diagram of this cogeneration cycle, which is very
similar to the T–s diagram for the regenerative Rankine cycle with an open FWH.
The difference between those two cycles being that, with the open FWH configura-
tion, the latent heat from the extracted steam is entirely given to the feed water for
the regenerative cycle, whereas with the cogeneration cycle, a fraction of this latent
heat is given to the heating stream. The value of this fraction is a function of the
temperatures and flows within the heat exchanger – which can vary with the time.
Hence, the position of point 2′ on the T–s diagram is variable. For example, if the
process heater recovers 100% of the latent heat from the extracted steam, then this
point will be on the left side of the vapour dome. However, if it is less than 100%,
the point will be under the vapour dome, in which case, the rest of the latent heat is
given to the feed water and the mixing chamber acts as an open FWH.

Please note that the configuration shown in Figures 1.29 and 1.30 is just one
possible configuration of the cogeneration Rankine cycle. Other configurations exist
and each one is specific to a certain type of application. For example, Figure 1.31
is a cogeneration cycle used for hot temperature applications, where instead of
extracting steam from the turbine at an intermediate pressure, the steam is extracted
just after the boiler. Hence, this steam is hotter (because its pressure is higher) and
for that reason the configuration is suitable for hot temperature applications. It is
also controllable by means of an expansion valve positioned just before the heat
exchanger which controls the pressure (and therefore the temperature) inside the
exchanger allowing the system to adapt to different heating demands.
1.2.5
Other Conﬁgurations of the Rankine Cycle
So far, only the classical Rankine cycle and its possible improvements have been
presented. This section now describes other thermodynamic cycles, derived from
the Rankine cycle, which also use steam as a working fluid.
1.2.5.1
Supercritical Rankine Cycles
As we have noted previously, increasing the HP of the system results in a more work
given to the turbine. However, because of the vapour dome, it also results in a lower
steam quality at the end of the expansion phase. The supercritical Rankine cycle

(SRC) bypasses this issue, because the working fluid is brought to such a condi-
tion that its pressure is above its critical pressure – a condition where the fluid is
in a supercritical state and where there is now no longer a link between its vapour
pressure and its temperature.
Advances in metallurgy and manufacturing techniques have made this possible,
to the point where we can realistically increase the HP to a pressure greater than the
critical pressure (for water) of 22.064 MPa (220.64 bar).
Hence, in an SRC, as the name implies, the fluid is in a supercritical state, i.e. it
is behaving as a liquid and a gas at the same time. Working as a SRC increases the
area of the cycle on the T–s diagram (see Figure 1.32), with a resultant increase in
the work given by the fluid to the turbine.
As their working fluid, SRCs can use steam or organic fluids, but steam is still the
most common fluid for both nuclear and fossil fuel power plants.
1.2.5.2
Reverse Rankine Cycles
The reverse Rankine cycle is another Rankine cycle widely used in the refrigeration
sector, where instead of cycling clockwise on the T–s diagram, the cycle operates in
a counterclockwise direction (as shown in Figure 1.33).
As we might expect, the components involved in this cycle are different and
comprise:
●A compressor, used to compress the gas
●A condenser, used to cool and liquefy the fluid
●An expansion valve, used to drop the pressure of the liquid and so expand it back
to a gas
●An evaporator, used to take heat from the environment

Rankine Cycles in Power Plants
The main application of the Rankine cycle is in converting thermal energy into
mechanical energy in order to then obtain electrical energy. Hence, Rankine cycles
are used in almost every high-temperature thermal power plant (fossil fuel, nuclear,
geothermal, biomass, concentrated solar power, etc.). This section briefly showcases
these different kinds of thermal power plant and their associated Rankine cycle.
1.2.6.1
Fossil Fuel Power Plants
Fossil fuel power plants consume either coal, fuel, or natural gas; the output power
of such power plants typically range between 500 and 700 MW. The operation of

32
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
such plant is based on complex Rankine cycles involving several turbines, pumps,
reheaters, and regenerators, and sometimes, multiple thermodynamic cycles are
used to improve the overall efficiency of the power plant. For example, the CCGT is
a type of power plant using natural gas as fuel, which uses both the Rankine cycle
and a gas turbine (Brayton) cycle to rotate two different electric generators.
In most cases, the cycle working fluid is still water because the temperature of the
hot source is high enough to vapourise the fluid under HP conditions.
1.2.6.2
Nuclear Power Plants
Enriched uranium is a high-energy density fuel – producing 1000 kWh requires only
4 g of this material whereas it requires 350 kg of coal! The power output of a nuclear
reactor is often between 0.9 and 1.5 GW [13] and different designs of nuclear reactor
exist, the most widespread being light water reactors such as the EPR reactor or the
AP1000 reactor. Heavy water, gas-cooled, and fast neutron reactors are less common
but provide other advantages over light water reactors [14].
In light water reactors, three water circuits are used to avoid radiation contamina-
tion. The primary circuit is still a hot water loop and is the hot source for the second
circuit, which then operates through a complex Rankine cycle. The third circuit is
used in order to cool the fluid after the expansion phase and acts as a condenser.
1.2.6.3
Overall Efﬁciency of a Power Plant
To determine the best way to convert energy into electricity we can compare the
overall efficiencies for different types of power plants. The overall efficiency of a
power plant corresponding to the ratio between the thermal energy input and the
electrical energy output over a given time being:
𝜂overall =
Electrical energy provided by the plant
Thermal energy given by the combustible
(1.33)
For the fossil fuel power plants, the thermal energy given by the combustible cor-
responds to the heat of combustion for the mass of fuel used during the given time,
and the current average value of the efficiency of a Rankine-based power plant using
fossil fuel is 33% [15]; however, it can range up to 40% in some cases [16]. In compar-
ison, CCGT power plants have an average efficiency of 45% but they can reach values
in excess of 50% and the efficiencies of current nuclear power plants are similar to
the efficiencies of the Rankine-based fossil fuel power plants, i.e. with an average
value of 33%.
Figure 1.34 is an illustration of the losses occurring during the energy transforma-
tion process:
●Neither the combustion of the fluid nor the nuclear fission reaction are perfect
processes. Hence it is necessary to introduce a boiler efficiency term (𝜂boiler) to
quantify the amount of heat given to the system compared to the heat delivered
by the combustible/reaction:
𝜂boiler =
Qin
Thermal energy given by the combustible
(1.34)

●The efficiency of the Rankine cycle (Eq. (1.14)) always induces energy losses.
Indeed, even if the cycle was ideal and without irreversibilities, some losses
would still be introduced by the cycle because the efficiency of this cycle cannot
be higher than the Carnot’s efficiency (Eq. (1.5)).
●Some of the work given by the fluid to the turbine is dissipated because of the
turbine mechanical efficiency:
𝜂turb =
Wshaft
Wturbine
(1.35)
●Finally, the generator does not convert 100% of the mechanical energy to electrical
energy:
𝜂generator =

(1.36)
So, in the end and assuming the pumps of the system are powered by the plant
itself, this leads to an overall efficiency equation for the power plant of [17]:
𝜂overall = 𝜂boiler ⋅𝜂actual cycle ⋅𝜂turb ⋅𝜂generator
(1.37)
Of course, this ‘overall’ efficiency only takes into consideration the losses occur-
ring during the production of the electrical power. It should also be noted that there
are many other sources of loss that occur after this production phase, e.g. during the
transport (transmission and distribution) phase and the consumption phase.
1.2.6.4
Case Studies
We need to appreciate that whilst real steam power plants are based on the Rankine
cycle, they used very complex configurations of this thermodynamic cycle, involv-
ing a lot of components, in order to reach the maximum efficiency for a reasonable
economic investment [18].
In these power plants, reheating and regeneration processes are widespread.

34
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
For instance, a combination of turbines are used as well as FWHs – all of them
working under different pressure conditions. Among these only one is an open
FWH, the others are closed FWHs using the drain cascaded backward technology.
Pumps are not included on this diagram but, for this configuration, at least four
pumps are necessary to increase the pressure of the fluid from one pressure stage to
the next. Of course, to control this system, a lot of valves, sensors, and controllers
are also required. So, when compared to the classical ideal Rankine cycle, this
power plant cycle is very much more complex.

1.3
Organic Rankine Cycle
The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is very similar to the Rankine cycle, the prefix
‘organic’ being derived from the fact that ORC devices use organic compounds
rather than water as their working fluid. Interest in ORC has accelerated in the
past 10 years, particularly in the areas of waste heat recovery and renewable energy
generation.
The typical parts found in an ORC are not dissimilar from those found in conven-
tional Rankine cycle plant and these include:
1. Pump
2. Evaporator
3. Expansion device
4. Condenser
The devices are constructed to form a circuit in the order of the list provided earlier,
however the configuration of an ORC system can vary depending on its application.
Further stages such as preheating and regeneration may also be included to both
improve the efficiency and also help by recovering energy from other sources. Fur-
thermore, different working fluids also affect the performance of an ORC, with the
selection of the working fluid being largely determined by its application, and where
the temperature of the target heat source is highly influential. To analyse such sys-
tems, we need to note:
Mass conservation is governed by the following equation:
∑
̇mout =
∑
̇min
(1.39)
where ̇mout (kg/s) is the mass flow rate of working fluid out of the closed system, and
̇min (kg/s) is the mass flow rate into the closed system.
The heat flow between any two points are defined using the following equation:
̇Q = ̇m ⋅Δh
(1.40)
where ̇Q (kW) is the heat flow, ̇m (kg/s) is the mass flow rate, and Δh is (kJ/kg) the
difference in enthalpy between two points in the ORC.

1.3 Organic Rankine Cycle
35
So, the net mechanical work is described using the following equations:
̇Wout = ̇Wgross −̇Win
(1.41)
̇Wout = ̇m ⋅Δhexp
(1.42)
where ̇Wout (kW) is the net mechanical power output from the ORC system, ̇Wgross
(kW) is the gross mechanical power output from the ORC,
̇
Win (kW) is the gross
mechanical power input into the ORC and Δhexp (kJ/kg) is the enthalpy change
across the expansion device.
Since the only input considered in the configurations is the pump,
̇
Win can be
calculated using Eq. (1.43).
̇Win = ̇m
𝜌⋅P
(1.43)
where ̇m (kg/s) is the mass flow rate, 𝜌(kg/m) is the density of the working fluid
under the working conditions, and P (N/m)] is the pressure.

Like the Rankine cycle, the ORC exists in many different configurations each
one of which has advantages and drawbacks and so is only suitable for a specific
application.
1.3.1.1
Basic ORC Conﬁguration
The basic configuration of an ORC is laid out in Figure 1.35; the system receiving
and producing useful energy from one heat source, and Figure 1.36 shows the T–S
graph for the same.
The evaporator between 2 and 3 heats the working fluid until it boils, and during
boiling, although the temperature remains constant, the entropy increases. This boil-
ing is represented by the flat line on the T–S graph. In the expander (between 3 and 4)
the gaseous working fluid undergoes expansion where its temperature decreases.
Finally, between 4 and 1 the working fluid passes through a condenser where the
fluid returns to the liquid state ready for the process to begin again.
The equations governing the basic ORC are given subsequently.

1.3.1.2
ORC with Preheating
Typically, configurations of ORC systems are more complicated where they are
designed and constructed to recover energy from multiple heat sources.
In automotive applications, e.g. heat can be recovered from both the exhaust
gases and the coolant liquid, so in this format the preheating system involves a heat

exchanger between the pump and the expansion device which then recovers heat
energy from the engine coolant fluid and transfers it to the working fluid.
This is shown in Figure 1.37 – the preheater in this case increasing the energy
content of the working fluid, so reducing the energy required for its evaporation in
the evaporator. This process is represented in Figure 1.38 by the additional heating
shown between 2 and 3, the preheating increasing the efficiency of the process by
reducing the energy required in the evaporation for boiling to occur.
The equations governing the ORC with preheating are given subsequently.

Recuperative ORC
In order to improve the overall thermal performances of the system, preheating of
the working fluid can also be achieved by recuperation as shown in Figure 1.39.
As with normal preheating, this process impacts the working fluid both before the
evaporator but unlike normal preheating, it also affects the working fluid after the
evaporator, and these effects are shown between points 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 on
Figure 1.40. As with preheating, the process reduces the energy needed for boiling
to occur in the evaporator.

Recuperative ORC with Preheating
In fact, both preheating and recuperation can be combined and operated within
the same system and this is shown in Figure 1.41. This is a combination of both
the processes that were shown in Figures 1.38 and 1.40; the entire process being
described by the T–S graph in Figure 1.42 where recuperation and preheating reduce
the energy required for boiling the fluid within the evaporator and also assist in the
condensation process of the working fluid after the expansion device.

Organic Working Fluids
Many different working fluids are used in ORC systems and the choice is largely
determined by the conditions under which the system is designed to operate.
Organic working fluids not only behave differently to water they each also have
different characteristics, but these can be split into three categories known as: dry-,
isentropic-, and wet-type working fluids. Wet, isentropic, and dry working fluids
have dT
dS values of <0, ∞, and >0 respectively, and the T–S graphs are displayed in
Figures 1.43–1.45, respectively.

There are four major benefits of using organic working fluids over water in Rank-
ine cycles:
1. Less heat is required for evaporation: This can be seen as the width of the T–S curve
is narrower for dry and isentropic working fluids than for wet working fluids.
2. Evaporation occurs at lower temperatures and pressures than water: The reduced
temperature of evaporation means that organic working fluids can be used to
recover energy from lower temperature heat sources than conventional Rankine
cycles.
3. Outlet from expansion devices is a vapour at lower temperatures: This reduces the
likelihood of damage to the expansion device, because condensation should only

occur after expansion. However, when the expansion inlet temperature is low and
the inlet pressure is high, because wet organic working fluids have lower efficien-
cies than other working fluids they may start to condense within the expansion
device potentially causing damage. This is one reason why dry and isentropic
working fluids are more popular in ORC systems, where after isentropic expan-
sion, they exist in the superheated state, reducing the risk of condensation and
thus minimising potential damage to the expansion device [19].
4. Smaller temperature difference between evaporation and condensation: This results
in reduced pressure drop across the condenser.
1.3.3
Organic Working Fluid Selection
The selection of the correct working fluid is critical to optimising the efficiency
of an ORC system. As such, it is one if not the most important aspect of an ORC
design. Working fluids are chosen based on their environmental sustainability,
ozone depletion, global warming potential (GWP), safety including flammability,
toxicity, and corrosivity, boiler vapour pressure, critical temperature, and thermal
stability as shown in Table 1.1 [20].
These characteristics affect the behaviour of the fluids upon heating – as seen
in the T–s graph for different working fluids in Figure 1.46 – and so under speci-
fied conditions, there should be a specific working fluid that will result in optimum
ORC energy recovery. However, we should also note that certain conditions such
as high temperatures and pressures make the use of some organic working fluids
unsafe.
As discussed already, if the temperature in the evaporator is low, then the working
fluid may condense within the expansion device resulting in decreased efficiency
and possible damage. Additionally, any working fluid that requires more entropy to

reach the superheated phase then also requires longer exposure within the evapora-
tor, and this would result in a lower mass flow rate than selecting a different working
fluid that requires less entropy to reach the superheated phase.
Different temperature–pressure charts are shown in Figure 1.47 for various com-
mon working fluids. This figure shows that different working fluids exist at different
pressures under the same temperature; these pressure differences also increase with
temperature. Choosing an incorrect working fluid could therefore present a safety
issue – where pressures increase with temperature, then they exceed the safe limits
of the system, resulting in its failure. Under such circumstances, a higher flow rate
would be required in order to reduce the risk of this safety issues and such a pump

would require a higher energy input – potentially resulting in decreased system effi-
ciency. The selection of the correct working fluid therefore is essential to ensure the
safety and high efficiency of an ORC system.
These examples – extreme as they may seem – indicate in terms of both efficiency
and safety the importance of selecting the correct organic working fluid for an ORC
waste heat recovery system.
Although not always the case historically, in addition to system safety issues, work-
ing fluids are now also selected on their sustainability. In the past, organic working
fluids included chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which due to their high ozone deple-
tion potentials (ODPs) were subsequently banned, and working fluids were devel-
oped that had significantly smaller ozone reduction potentials. Nonetheless, despite
the benefits of reduced ozone depletion capacity, these improved fluids still pos-
sessed very high GWPs and so, in turn, this then has led to the development of
working fluids with reduced GWPs such as R123 and R600. The ozone depletion
and GWPs of some common working fluids are shown in Table 1.2.
Note: ODP is defined as the relative amount of degradation to the ozone layer
a substance can cause, with trichlorofluoromethane (R-11 or CFC-11) being fixed
at 1.0.

1.3.4
Applications of the ORC
There are two main energy applications for the ORC: one is waste heat recovery
(where ORC is used to improve the performance of an energy production process
or recover energy from an exhaust stream) and the other being in the renewable
energy sector. Here ORCs can be used to recover energy from geothermal energy,
solar energy, and biomass combustion.
1.3.4.1
Waste Heat Recovery
The ORC is typically used for power output range between 100 kW and 2 MW, and
Table 1.3 shows some example applications of ORC, typically in recovery of waste
heat from exhaust gases in the industries identified. Configurations of the ORC can
also vary depending on the application.
Renewable Energy
Biomass: Biomass energy generation is becoming more popular as it is now quite
possible to produce energy from food waste and other organic materials that his-
torically would be seen as waste materials. Furthermore, biomass fuels can be
reproduced more quickly than fossil fuels – the length of the carbon cycle being
much shorter for biomass than for fossil fuels. Unfortunately for this application,
biomass fuels typically burn at lower temperatures than fossil fuels. Which means
that conventional Rankine cycles are exposed to a higher risk of condensation
within the expanders when used for power generation and biomass boilers. Con-
sequently, conventional Rankine cycles may require superheating to allow their
use in biomass energy recovery, and for this reason, ORCs are a popular energy
recovery solution for use with biomass fuels [29].
Solar: ORCs make possible the recovery of thermal energy from solar radiation
particularly in warmer countries. The low boiling temperatures of the organic

46
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
working fluids used allows for the capture of energy from the Sun in such devices
as flat panel collectors. Phase change materials can also be incorporated into
such systems to store heat when energy is not required or when excess energy is
being produced, this stored energy then being released later [30].
Geothermal: Ground source heat pumps allow for the cooling or heating of a property
making use of the soil and rock as an energy store. This is practical because the
year-round temperature of soil and rock at depths of only a few metres is assumed
to be constant. Therefore, in summer, heat pumps can be used in reverse to take
thermal energy from the air within a building and store it in the ground; whilst
in winter, the process can be reversed, and energy taken from the ground can be
used to heat the air inside the building. These systems can be improved by the use
of ORC systems that help solve the ‘cold accumulation problem’ of such systems,
by storing energy in seasons that require less heating [31].
1.4
Kalina Cycle
The Kalina cycles are a family of thermodynamic power cycles that utilise a mix-
ture of fluids as their working fluid. The first Kalina cycle (also sometimes called
the reverse absorption cycle) was developed in 1984 by Alexander Kalina, a Russian
engineer [32], who then founded Exergy Inc., a company specialising in energetic
efficiency and waste heat recovery.
The family of cycles was still inspired by the family of Rankine cycles. Their
main goal being to further improve both the energetic and exegetic efficiencies
of the thermodynamic power cycle by making use of the fact that in Rankine
cycles a lot of energy is lost during the boiling phase. Moreover, as the temperature
profiles of the working fluid and the heating fluid do not match the thermal
behaviours of the source and working fluid diverge, thus irreversibilities are created
and exergy is destroyed. Kalina cycles therefore offer a solution to this energetic
issue and represent a big step forward for power cycles and their use in electricity
generation [33].
In this section, the theoretical operation of Kalina cycles will be explained and
illustrated. The advantages and drawbacks of this new family of power cycle are
also discussed and compared to both classical steam cycles and ORCs. Next, appli-
cations for these thermodynamic cycles are presented and some case studies are
used to clarify explanations. Lastly, current researches on Kalina cycles are briefly
reviewed to give the reader an indication of the current state of research on this
subject.
1.4.1
Cycle Fundamentals
As just stated, the Kalina cycle is a power cycle based on the Rankine cycle. The
difference arises in using a mixture of fluids as the working fluid.
Using a mixture of fluids (instead of a pure substance) as the working fluid allows
vapourisation and condensation to occur under a constant pressure through a

1.4 Kalina Cycle
47
non-isothermal process. This kind of mixture being called a non-azeotropic mixture
(one with components that have different boiling points), as this way there is a
better match between the temperature profiles of the working fluid and the heating
fluid during the boiling phase. Helpfully, this is also the case between the working
fluid and the cooling fluid in the condensation phase.
Currently, the most commonly used mixture for a Kalina cycle is an ammonia–
water solution, and although relatively new, this mixture has proven its efficiency
through various experiments and pilot projects [33].
It is successful because in a Kalina cycle, the mass fraction of ammonia has a
new degree of freedom, allowing more flexibility and so reaching higher efficiencies.
The main feature being that the mass fraction of ammonia is now directly linked
to the saturation pressure of the mixture. So if, e.g. the pressure is held constant
whilst the mass fraction of ammonia is decreasing, then vapourisation of the fluid
will start at a higher temperature, as shown in Figure 1.48.
The ammonia vaporises first because it is more volatile than water and hence the
mixture concentration of ammonia decreases, and this leads to an increase of the
saturation temperature of the resultant mixture. This way, the boiling phase occurs
over a range of temperatures and not just at one given temperature as would be the
case for a pure substance.
Being able to control the mass fraction of ammonia in each part of the circuit is
therefore an important factor and so, in comparison to more conventional steam
cycles, Kalina cycles require new components. For example, a separator is certainly
required to control the proportion of ammonia in the mixture. This control must
occur at every stage of the circuit, so within the separator are two different phases: a
liquid phase which is a lean ammonia–water solution (as ammonia is more volatile
than water) and a gas phase which is rich in ammonia. Mixing one of these phases
with the working ammonia–water solution is a way to either increase or decrease
the mass fraction of the ammonia depending on which phase is being mixed with
the solution.

1 Thermodynamic Cycles
To operate correctly, a high proportion of ammonia is required in the boiler to
enhance the heat transfer. However, keeping this high proportion of ammonia
during the condensation phase implies a very low condensation temperature
or pressure. So, to overcome this issue, the concentration of ammonia in the
ammonia–water solution is reduced before the condensation phase. It was used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the Kalina cycles in Canoga, New York, in 1992 on a
6.5 MW power plant [34].
In this configuration, the boiler of the system is also called the heat recovery vapour
generator (HRVG). Moreover, the subsystem operating the condensation and dis-
tillation phase is called distillation and condensation subsystem (DCSS). Those two
acronyms are widely used for Kalina cycles. Throughout the cycle, the ammonia
concentration of the mixture is varying. It is like different fluids were being used, i.e.
the fluid in the boiler section is very different from the fluid in the condenser section.
Many other configurations also exist, each tailored for a specific application.
1.4.1.1
Why Use Ammonia–Water Solution in Kalina Cycle?
At this time, Kalina cycles predominantly use the ammonia–water solution with
hardly any other variants being reported. The mixture displays interesting physical,
chemical, economic, and ecological properties, and by varying the percentage mix
it can be made to behave like different fluids compared to a pure compound. The
main reason therefore for choosing this solution is its flexibility, since by varying
the ammonia concentration using distillation, we can alter either the temperature
or the pressure of saturation.
Ammonia–water solution also has an excellent heat transfer coefficient and a low
freezing point. In addition, because ammonia and water have similar molecular
weights, it is possible to use standard components (turbine, pump, etc.) that have
already proven their efficiencies in steam power plants. However, some materials
such as copper, aluminium, and mild steel cannot be used with ammonia, but oth-
erwise standard materials such as carbon steel and standard high-temperature alloys
are fine.
In addition, from an economic point of view, the two components of the mixture
are relatively inexpensive and widely available. Water is abundant and ammonia is
produced on a world-scale for industrial and domestic uses.
The main issue with ammonia is its toxicity. If the human brain is exposed to high
levels of this substance, it can lead to drowsiness and coma [35]. However, as ammo-
nia is a gas under atmospheric pressure and temperature, it is relatively easy to vent
off and so with the relevant safety procedures, already proven in industrial plants
that use large quantities of ammonia, its use here is considered acceptable. More-
over, as ammonia has a strong smell, it is a self-alarming product which makes its
detection easier.
However, the usage of ammonia can also lead to different types of corrosion, and
these will be discussed in Section 1.4.2.
Contrary to the fluids used in ORCs, ammonia and water are ecological-friendly.
Indeed, the GWP of each are zero, which means that the accidental release of those
fluids into the atmosphere has no effect on the global warming. Conversely, the fluids

1.4 Kalina Cycle
49
used in ORCs have a proven effect on the global warming. So, in case of leakage from
an ORC power plant, large quantities of fluid, harmful to the environment, could
be released into the atmosphere. This is not the case for Kalina cycle-based power
plants and furthermore, as with the modern organic fluids used in ORCs, the ODP
of ammonia is also equal to 0.
1.4.2
Advantages and Drawbacks
To evaluate the potential of this technology, it is important to compare it with the
current and most commonly used power cycles of steam systems and ORCs.
1.4.2.1
Advantages
Generally, Kalina cycles have better energetic and exergetic performances than
Rankine cycles or ORCs.
As a reference, the Carnot’s efficiency is given by:
𝜂= 1 −TC
TH
(1.68)
In this formula, TH (K) is the average hot source temperature and TC (K) is the
average cold source temperature. So if we can increase the average hot temperature
and at the same time lower the average cold temperature, then the efficiency of the
thermodynamic cycle will be improved. Kalina cycles achieve this, compared to not
only the theoretical Carnot cycle, but also the very practical Rankine cycles. So for
that reason alone, Kalina cycles have a better energetic efficiency.
Moreover, during the boiling and condensing phases, because the temperature
profile of the mixture has a better match to the temperature profile of the heat-
ing/cooling fluid, heat exchanges are enhanced for Kalina cycles compared to Rank-
ine cycles. Less exergy is destroyed during the heat exchange phases for Kalina cycles
so the irreversibilities of the process are reduced. Simulations have showed that the
best work output given by a Kalina cycle is 20% to 24% higher than the equivalent
from a dual pressure Rankine cycle [33].
Also, when using a geothermal spring, Kalina cycles can generate from 10% to 50%
more power than classical steam systems (ORCs), particularly when the temperature
of the source is below 200 ∘C [36]. When the hot source is at medium temperature,
e.g. with waste heat recovery, the efficiency increase provided by the Kalina cycle
against steam cycles is between 10% and 40% [37].
The gains are not just in simulations. During the Global CempPower conference in
2012 [38], M.D. Mirolli (formerly from Wasabi Energy) and Kevin Happ (FLSmidth)
reported that the use of Kalina cycles for waste heat recovery in the cement industry
can lead to a 15–25% improvement of the recovery compared to current technologies
(ORCs).
As we have already noted, because the properties of the working fluid can be
changed during the operation of the plant, Kalina cycle-based plant can adapt
easily to hot and cold days by varying the proportion of ammonia – this flexi-
bility then allows Kalina cycles to harness energy from a wider range of low to
medium–high-temperature heat sources.

50
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
The fact also that standard components can be used to operate a Kalina cycle is an
advantage as it increases the reliability of the potential new power plants, because
even if they are using a relatively new technology, their operation is based on tried
and tested efficiency-proven components.
1.4.2.2
Drawbacks
Ammonia is a toxic fluid, so even if it is easy to vent off under atmospheric pressure
and self-alarming due to its smell, it is relatively dangerous to use on a large scale.
However, some safety procedures exist, and for the moment no health issue linked
to Kalina cycle-based power plants have been recorded. Compared to the hydrocar-
bons used in ORCs, ammonia is non-flammable and does not represent an explosion
hazard.
General corrosion can also occur with this type of power plant due to the presence
of water. However, as ammonia raises the pH level of the solution, the phenomenon
is less important than in classical steam cycles. Indeed, a high pH and a low oxy-
gen proportion can result in the growth of protective magnetite layers (Fe3O4) on
tube surfaces, but generally, a good control of the water chemistry is needed to avoid
issues linked to corrosion.
The CO2 level must also be controlled to avoid the formation of ammonium car-
bamate. This can occur if ammonia and carbon dioxide react under conditions of
HP and high temperature. Furthermore, if the temperature of the mixture exceeds
400 ∘C, then ammonia becomes unstable and leading to nitride corrosion [39].
Currently, the physical properties of an ammonia–water solution are not yet fully
known, particularly in the supercritical region where very little data is currently
available. Some correlations exist and these are leading to smaller and smaller dif-
ferences between experimental tests and simulations.
Kalina cycles are sometimes said to be more complex than steam cycles. This
assumption is questionable, but it is undeniable that steam cycles have proved their
efficiency and reliability across time. So even though pilot projects exist for the
Kalina cycle it is relatively understandable why some industries are quite hostile to
any additional investment in this technology at the present time.
1.4.3
Applications of the Kalina Cycle
Because the boiling temperature of the mixture varies, it can start to evaporate at
a lower temperature than for the Rankine cycle at a given pressure. This is why
Kalina cycles are mostly used in geothermal power plants (100–120 ∘C) and waste
heat recovery (300–400 ∘C) [40]. For waste heat recovery applications, the most suit-
able applications are the cement industry, glass industry, petrochemical industry,
steel industry, and potentially, for thermal power plants [39]. Using Kalina cycles as
bottoming cycles in thermal power plant is possible, but for now it is not yet econom-
ically viable because the architecture of such a cycle is quite complex. Kalina cycles
can also be used with alternative renewable energies other than geothermal, and
some configurations of the cycle are made for solar thermal and ocean thermal [41]
operations (Figure 1.49).

1.4.3.1
The Different Conﬁgurations of the Cycle
Kalina cycles are part of a thermodynamic family of cycles. These vary by the num-
ber of each component, how they are arranged, and how they are linked together. To
date, a lot of interesting Kalina cycle configurations have been designed and studied;
every configuration being suitable for a particular type of application and so desig-
nated by a code. For example, KCS-1 was the very first cycle that used a mixture of
fluids and was proposed by Kalina himself in 1984 [42].
All these thermodynamic cycles are split into two groups. The oldest ones are
called first-generation Kalina cycles – the Kalina cycle being a trademark involving
all the first-generation Kalina cycles [43].
Figure 1.50 shows three configurations of the Kalina cycle system [44], all suitable
for geothermal applications. KCS-11 was designed for the high-temperature geother-
mal resources and KCS-34 for lower temperature geothermal resources. Those two
cycles are the most common Kalina cycles used for geothermal application. KSG-1
is very similar to KCS-34, the KSG-1 patent is held by Siemens.
A second generation of Kalina cycle was developed by Dr. Alexander Kalina from
2008 to 2014. The patents for those new cycles are all owned by a company called
Kalex LLC, founded by Kalina.
Those new cycles are more efficient and provide an improved power output. For
example, the SG-2a cycle offers a better energetic and exergetic efficiency than either
KCS-11 or KCS-34 when using geothermal heat sources in temperature range from
125 to 150 ∘C [45].
So even though these new cycles have a more complex architecture than their
first-generation counterparts and so are consequently more expensive, they still offer
a shorter payback period [46]. Second-generation Kalina cycles therefore seem most
promising, and configurations now exist for biomass, geothermal, solar thermal,
cement waste heat, bottoming cycle, and ocean solar thermal applications [47].

Case Studies
Some pilot power plants exist and are currently producing energy using Kalina
cycles. Table 1.4 lists case studies from around the world as of 2012.
The first large-scale Kalina cycle-based power plant was built in the United States
in 1992 and operated for five years recovering nuclear waste heat and was able to
produce 6.5 MW of electricity [39].
A famous Kalina-based plant (KCS-34) was built in Húsavík, Iceland. It is a 2 MW
geothermal power plant and harnesses the energy of 125 ∘C geothermal brine,
providing 80% of the electrical demand of the local town’s 2500 inhabitants [48].
Another geothermal power plant (KCS34), also harnessing geothermal hot brine
through a Kalina cycle, is located at Unterhachting in Germany. This power plant
is generating 3.4 MW of electricity. The geothermal brine is also providing 38 MW
of thermal energy to a district heating system. A third geothermal power plant
(KCS-34) using the Kalina technology is the Bruchsal power plant [49], also in
Germany.
Further Kalina cycle projects had been designed since 2012. For example, the Star
Cement plant in Dubai is a 4.75 MW plant also using this technology [3], and it is
anticipated, as we move forward, that more and more projects utilising Kalina cycles
technology will evolve [50].
1.5
Brayton Cycle
The Brayton cycle is also known as the ‘gas turbine cycle’ or the Joule cycle. It is an
open cycle, whereby the intake and exhaust points are both open to the environment
[51].

54
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
Air enters the engine and is compressed by the compressor (resulting in HP air).
Energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it within the com-
bustion chamber, and now this high-temperature pressurised gas is used to drive a
turbine (mounted on the same shaft as the compressor) to produce work output.
Finally, the combusted gases and any unused energy leaves through the exhaust and
in doing so some of this unused energy can be recovered.
First though, the Brayton cycle itself. This consists of a compression stage (process
1–2) which takes place adiabatically followed by a second stage (process 2–3) – the
heat addition process – which occurs isobarically. The third stage (process 3–4) is an
expansion process which occurs adiabatically and the final stage (process 4–1), heat
rejection, occurs isobarically, all as shown in Figure 1.51.
The Brayton cycle is different from the Otto and Diesel cycles in that the processes
occur within an open system. Therefore, in order to determine the heat transfer and
work for the process an open system and steady flow analysis are used.
The schematic of the open Brayton process is shown in Figure 1.52, however, to
further define the process as a cycle we need to include the heat output as shown in
Figure 1.53.
The thermal efficiency of the Brayton 𝜂th cycle is given by the following equation:
𝜂th = Wnet
Qin
= 1 −Qout
Qin
(1.69)
where Wnet (kJ) is the net work output of the system, Qin (kJ) is the heat input, and
Qout (kJ) is the heat output.
The conservation of mass then gives:
̇min = ̇mout
(1.70)
̇m2 = ̇m3 = ̇m
(1.71)
where m2 and m3 are the mass flow rate of fluid leaving the compressor and the mass
flow rate entering the turbine (kg/s), respectively.

Therefore,
𝜂th = 1 −qout
qin
= 1 −
Cp(T4 −T1)
Cp(T3 −T2)
(1.72)
where qout(kJ∕kg) = Qout
m , Cp (kJ/kg K) is the specific heat capacity of the working
fluid (depending on the temperature), and Tx (K) is the temperature of the fluid
given point.
Assuming the specific heat is constant (cold air standard analysis) gives:
𝜂th = 1 −T4 −T1
T3 −T2
= 1 −

(

(1.74)

(1.75)
In these last two equations, k is the heat capacity ratio, also known as the adiabatic
index.
Moreover, as processes 2–3 and 4–1 are isobaric:
P2 = P3
(1.76)
P4 = P1
(1.77)
Thus,
T2
T1
= T3
T4
(1.78)
Which can also be written this way:
T4
T1
= T3
T2
(1.79)
So that finally, the efficiency of the ideal Brayton cycle is given by:
𝜂th = 1 −T1

(1.80)
Now as the pressure ratio is defined as:
rp = P2
P1
(1.81)
Figure 1.54 shows a typical pressure ratio curve for gas turbine engine.
Then the efficiency of the cycle can also be written using this coefficient as:

However, this is not the whole of the story because some of work produced by the

1.5.1
Regenerative Brayton Cycle (Regenerator)
Because the temperature of the turbine exhaust is higher than the exit stream of
the compressor, it presents an ideal opportunity to install a heat exchanger located
between the hot exhaust of the turbine and the cooler gas leaving the compressor.
Such a heat exchanger is also known as a regenerator or a recuperator. Figure 1.55
shows a schematic of the regenerative Brayton cycle.
And so in describing the efficiency of this regenerator, a regenerator efficiency term
needs to be introduced, its calculation involving qregen,max and qregen,act,and which can
be obtained through enthalpy differences expressed in kJ/kg (see Figure 1.56).
𝜀regen =
qregen,max (kJ∕kg)
qregen,act (kJ∕kg)
(1.84)
qregen,max = h′
5 −h2 = h4 −h2
(1.85)
qregen,act = h5 −h2
(1.86)
Hence,
𝜀regen = h5 −h2
h4 −h2
(1.87)
For ideal gases using the cold air standard analysis with constant specific heat, the
regenerator effectiveness becomes:
𝜀regen = T5 −T2
T4 −T2
(1.88)
So, for the efficiency of the cycle (using the closed cycle analysis) this leads to:
𝜂th,regen = 1 −qout
qin
= 1 −h6 −h1
h3 −h5

Compressor Analysis
The work (kW) used by the compressor is given by the following equation:
̇Wact,comp = ̇m(h2a −h1)
(1.91)
where ̇m is the mass flow rate of working fluid (in kg/s) and hx is the enthalpy at the
given point (kJ/kg).
Hence the adiabatic efficiency of the compressor is given by:
𝜂comp =
̇Wisen,comp
̇Wact,comp
= h2s −h1
h2a −h1
≅T2s −T1

𝜂turb =
̇Wact,turb

≅T3 −T4a

The heat supplied to the cycle (kJ/kg) for process 5 to 3 can be calculated as follows:

(1.97)
The plot in Figure 1.57 shows the regenerative Brayton cycle efficiency as a func-
tion of the pressure ratio and minimum and maximum temperature ratio, T1∕T3.

1.5.2
Regenerative Brayton Cycle (Reheater and Intercooler)
The performance of a Brayton cycle can be further improved by incorporating an
intercooler and a reheat process, the process schematic in Figure 1.58 shows a poten-
tial layout for a Brayton cycle with such additions. The concept is simple. During
multi-stage compression, cooling the working fluid between each stage ultimately
reduces the amount of work that is required by each compressor. This is because
if we reduce the specific volume of the working fluid by cooling, then less work is
required to achieve a set pressure increase.

So, incorporating a reheating process between two or more turbines of a
multi-stage expansion ultimately results in an increase in the net work done
and therefore a more efficient cycle. The temperature against entropy for this
thermodynamic cycle is shown in Figure 1.59.

To minimise the work used by the compressors, P2 (Pa) should be set as:

Chapter Summary
To conclude, the Rankine cycle can be considered (alongside the Carnot cycle) as
the basis for all the external combustion thermodynamic cycles that aim to convert
thermal energy into mechanical energy. In most cases the mechanical energy is then
converted into electrical energy because of its greater versatility and adaptability as
a form of energy.
Even though the ideal Rankine cycle is quite simple, a significant number of
improvements can still be made to it in order to enhance the performance of the
system and increase its energetic efficiency – reheating, regeneration, increasing or
decreasing the pressure can all be considered, in order to make the most of a power
plant.
In most cases, water is used as the working fluid because it is non-toxic,
non-reactive, abundant, cost-effective, and displays good thermodynamic proper-
ties. However, using an organic fluid is also an option to help further increase the
efficiency of the Rankine cycle or to harness medium temperature hot sources such
as geothermal, biomass solar energy, or for waste heat recovery. In which case, this
new cycle is known as an ORC, but even this can be further improved in many
ways using reheaters and/or recuperators for instance. The use of new fluids also
allows for greater flexibility, in that different fluids may be more suitable for specific
applications, thus allowing them to reach their greatest possible efficiency. Hence,
as discussed earlier, the selection of the right working fluid is crucial to efficient
operation. To assist in this choice, organic fluids are divided into three families:
wet-type fluids, dry-type fluids, and isentropic fluids, and currently a huge number
of studies are focusing on the integration of ORC with existing systems so as to
improve their overall efficiency.
Recent technological advances also allow the working fluid (water or organic
fluid) to be used in supercritical conditions in order to improve the amount of work
provided by the turbine(s) of a power plant.
In this respect, the Kalina cycle can be considered as the biggest step forward since
the development of the Rankine steam cycles and ORCs. The technology presents a
better energetic efficiency than steam cycles particularly for low-grade temperature
applications such as geothermal and waste heat recovery.
The technology is relatively new; hence the capital expenditure necessary for a
Kalina cycle-based power plant is, in most cases, higher than for a conventional
system. However, as the Kalina cycle systems have a higher efficiency, their pay-
back period is reduced, particularly for the latest second-generation cycles. It is also
important to note that the Kalina cycles are a family of thermodynamic cycles and so
a vast number of configurations exist, each one being suitable for a specific applica-
tion. In most cases, a water–ammonia mixture is used as the working fluid in those

62
1 Thermodynamic Cycles
employing binary cycles. Indeed, this fluid offers interesting thermal performance;
is compatible with standard materials and components; is ecological-friendly, abun-
dant, and relatively inexpensive.
The reverse Kalina cycle is also a widely known thermodynamic cycle in that it
is the absorption refrigeration cycle. This cycle uses an absorber and a generator
instead of a compressor to carry out the suction and compression processes, meaning
that almost no electricity is required to run the cycle. The future of Kalina cycles
seems promising. An ever-increasing number of scientific studies are addressing the
integration of this cycle in various systems: geothermal power plants, cement plants,
concentrated solar power plants, and biomass power plants.
Now the Brayton cycle, although different to the Rankine cycle and its derivatives
in that it is an open thermodynamic cycle, still has the same role to play as the closed
power cycle – converting heat into mechanical energy – and the cycle efficiency can
also be improved by using different technologies such as regeneration, reheating,
and intercooling. The Brayton cycle can also use organic fluids as their working fluid
(CO2 in most cases) and sometimes these fluids too can operate under supercritical
conditions with a further increase in efficiency.
But we are not just thinking about systems in isolation. Even if Rankine cycles
and Brayton cycles are quite different, they can still be used together in combined
cycles. In the CCGT plant, those two cycles are used together to reach a relatively
high overall thermal efficiency (from 50% to 63%). So high, that the association of the
Rankine cycle with the Brayton cycle is currently the most efficient way of producing
electricity on a large scale. For example, the Chubu Electric Nishi-Nagoya power
plant Block-1 in Japan is achieving a gross efficiency of 63.08%, and so is currently
recognised as the world’s most efficient combined cycle power plant.

Waste Heat Recovery
2.1
Burner and Air Preheaters
Air preheating is a common application for recovered waste heat; the energy con-
tent within a hot fluid being transferred to the cooler air stream and a selection of
the technologies used for this purpose are described within this section. The main
technologies are recuperators, regenerators, and run-around coils with each tech-
nology having multiple variants. The differences, advantages, and disadvantages are
also highlighted.
2.1.1
Recuperators
The simplest form a recuperator can take is a radiative recuperator (Figure 2.1). This
consists of two concentric metal tubes where hot gases, such as exhaust gases, pass
through the inner tube and a cooler fluid, usually a gas, passes through the outer
tube. Heat is extracted primarily by the radiation mechanism. This design exhibits
very low-pressure losses in comparison to other technologies [1], but it has been
noted that the technology only has between 40% and 60% heat transfer efficien-
cies – which falls short of other available technologies. Additionally, they require
routine maintenance as fouling from condensable vapours and particulates can be
an issue [2]. To apply this technology to higher temperature streams, dilution can be
used to lower the temperature before passing through the recuperator so as to avoid
overheating the structure material and to prevent thermal stresses. The simplicity
of the design allows these to be incorporated directly into stacks where the exhaust
gases energy can be recovered close to source.
Convection recuperators (Figure 2.2) consist of a tube bundle around which a hot
gas passes. A shell, sometimes baffled, encloses the tubes in which the cooler fluid
flows. They are suitable for low-temperature applications and those with a high mass
flow rate [3]. Metallic units can be used at gas temperatures <1000 ∘C; however,
exposure to higher temperatures decreases their lifespan. Ceramic recuperators are
often applied for higher temperature applications up to 1550 ∘C [4].
Better heat transfer effectiveness can be achieved by combining multiple energy
transfer mechanisms into one recuperator. These are known as hybrid recuperators,
as shown in Figure 2.3. These tend to have two sections that recover by radiation and

2.1.1.1
Recuperative Burners
Many industrial processes use combustion to heat or melt a product by using burn-
ers which control the combustion reaction by providing a uniform and controlled

heat input to that process. For example, furnaces to melt aluminium, kilns to fire
ceramic products, or spray dryers to evaporate moisture and generate a powdered
product. A burner is an energy transducer which converts one form of energy to
another – chemical energy in the form of fuel into heat energy – the energy content
provided to the process being controlled in this way. Full combustion is shown by:
Fuel + O2 →CO2 + H2O + ΔH
(2.1)
The oxygen for the reaction can be supplied by the roughly 21% oxygen content
of air (known as combustion air), or supplied by oxygen tanks by either injecting
pure oxygen or enriching the combustion air with a higher proportion of oxygen.
ΔH is the enthalpy and shows the energy released, the majority of which is in the
form of heat. The combustion products are usually vented by a flue to be treated and
then released to atmosphere. However, a proportion of their energy still remains
that hasn’t been transferred to the process. Three opportunities therefore exist for
recovering heat from a combustion processes: from the product, the exhaust gases or
from shell or cooling water losses. To recover the heat from combustion processes,
recuperative and regenerative burners have been developed to harness this waste
heat by using the energy to preheat the combustion air for the combustion process.
Using a heat recovery burner is of paramount importance, if not the most important
factor to ensure fuel use is reduced as much as possible whilst ensuring an efficient
and cost-effective process.
The reason that fuel consumption is reduced by the increase in combustion air
temperature is threefold. Firstly, the enthalpy within the waste gas is reintroduced

70
2 Waste Heat Recovery
into the furnace, a hotter flame is achieved, and the activation energy of a reac-
tion is more readily reached, and as such there is increased re-radiation leading to
more efficient combustion so greater energy release. Initially, a flame is ignited on a
burner which will continue to burn as long as the combustion precursors are present.
The heat is fed back from the reaction to continue the combustion by the mecha-
nisms of re-radiation and recirculation [5]. Re-radiation is a mechanism that con-
tributes to flame stability. Energy returns from the high-temperature burning zone,
the product, and the combustion chamber walls. Modern burners rely on recircula-
tion, shown by Figure 2.4. The presence of recirculating hot combustion products
close to the burner nozzle raises the fuel temperature and aids ignition. The recir-
culation happens either outside the flame (external) or within the axis of the burner
nozzle due to entrainment by a turbulent jet (internal). Internal recirculation can
be promoted by flow deviation using bluff bodies or by creating swirl within the
combustion air.
Recuperative, also known as self-recuperative, burners specifically work by
transporting the exhaust gases past the combustion air separated by a thermally
conductive material [6]. The exhaust gases are forced back through the burner by
an educator. The exhaust gas transfers energy to the material by convection, the
energy transfers across the material by conduction and then the cooler combustion
air receives this energy and increases in temperature. For this reason they tend to be
gas burners but they can also be configured for liquid burners, and for a recuperative
burner, this conductive layer is integral to the burner design. Independent heat
exchangers (HEXs) can be installed within the system to preheat combustion air
(Figure 2.5) but this section specifically deals with recuperative burners because
it tends to be simpler to integrate the heat exchange mechanism into the burner
design which is then more cost-effective. The recuperative burners continuously
transfer heat between two fluids and so tend to operate in a steady state and are more
suited to lower temperatures, but recuperative burners have a lower heat recovery
efficiency than other technologies and cannot be used with particulate-loaded or
condensable vapour-containing exhaust gases [2].

2.1.1.2
Classifying Recuperative Burners
Recuperative burners are generally classified by fuel type, design of the flow
(Table 2.1), the flame profile, and size. Counter-flow is most effective for heat
transfer as the heat sink can reach similar temperatures to the exhaust gas inlet but
parallel flow is limited to equivalent source and sink outlet temperatures. In terms
of fuel type, methane, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and propane are
typical examples of gaseous fuels. Heavy and light fuel oil (HFO or LFO), as well as
diesel, are examples of liquid fuels used in recuperative burners. Gas fuel systems
can be either premixed or turbulent jet diffusion burners, and are used when a
small but high-intensity flame is required. The premixing can be achieved using a
venturi or a mixing tube, the air and gas being supplied at a high pressure to prevent
the flame returning into the burner and to ensure sufficient mixing. This leads
to very high combustion efficiency. Partial premix burners can be used by having
secondary airports which control flame temperature and profile and minimise NOx
formation. Jet diffusion is the predominant industrial burner technology. A fuel jet
is introduced separately and coaxially surrounding the combustion air. Within the
combustion chamber these streams mix via entrainment and ignite. [5]
When sizing a burner, over- or underheating can cause major issues with a process.
Consequently, the burner used must correspond to the demands of the system. If
overheating occurs burners will cycle, leading to greater fluctuations in temperature
and unnecessary overuse of system controls. Conversely, underperformance can lead
to longer process times and inadequate final products.

Efﬁciency Improvement and Fuel Savings
It has been reported that preheating combustion air can increase furnace efficiency
by up to 50%. Table 2.2 reflects the furnace efficiency as a result of introducing pre-
heated combustion air.
The capital expenditure for the installation of these burners can be high. There-
fore, reduced energy costs, improvements in process efficiency, and lower emissions
of NOx are important factors to consider. Table 2.3 provides an overall comparison
of the advantages and disadvantages for a recuperative burner.

When considering a heat recovery burner over a standard burner, its thermal effi-
ciency can be compared in two ways – either the fuel reduction for providing an
equivalent heat to the load or the increased thermal output for the same fuel usage.
However, since even updated processes normally still require the same operating
temperatures, the first method of calculating the costs savings from fuel reduction
is predominantly used.
The thermal efficiency for a recuperative burner can be measured using three
equations [8]:
Net available heat (%) =
(Firing rate −Heat in exhaust gas
Firing rate
)

Effectiveness, 𝜀=

(2.4)
Burner performance is measured by the effectiveness, 𝜀, shown by Eq. (2.4) which
describes the transfer of heat from the exhaust gases to the combustion air, and typi-
cally recuperators have an efficiency between 0.3 and 0.6 [2, 8]. Of course, in addition
to the advantages of using less fuel, heat recovery burners also release less CO2 into
the atmosphere.
2.1.2
Regenerators
A HEX is designated as a regenerator if it includes a thermal storage (TES) media
that extracts and stores energy within the cooling a fluid, and which is then released
to another fluid. As these units have a high surface area to volume ratio, they are
more economical compared to recuperators.
2.1.2.1
Rotary Regenerators
Rotary regenerators (also known as rotary air preheaters) include heat wheels,
Rothemuhle, Munter, or Ljungstrom wheels. Typical uses are for low- to medium-
temperature ranges but high temperatures are possible whilst still providing a high
efficiency of heat transfer [9, 10]. Traditionally, for waste heat recovery (WHR), they
have been applied to the combustion processes in power plants, but applications for
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and other industrial processes
are now available – wheels having been built with diameters as large as 21 m and a
throughput of 1130 m3/min of air [4].
Rotary regenerators span across two isolated ducts: one containing the hot stream
and the other the cool stream, usually in counter-flow. The regenerator can be
constructed from a woven mesh of knitted aluminium or stainless steel wire, or
a honeycomb glass ceramic structure or silicon nitrides – amongst others – so as
to create a larger heat transfer surface with a high heat capacity. The choice of
material depends on the temperature of the streams, the contamination load, and
the capital expense budget. This particular regenerator reduced 1600 ∘C exhaust
gases to 140–310 ∘C by preheating combustion air for burners to 1400 ∘C from 20 ∘C.
This provides a 62% fuel reduction – an attractive proposition [11, 12]. Overall
efficiency has been reported as high as 85% [2]. The Rothemuhle regenerator is an
adaption of this standard design, in that a static wheel is used with rotating hoods
to distribute the airstreams across the matrix. This design is not commonly applied
but has typically been utilised in power generating plants.
Rotary regenerators have issues with fouling and high pressure drop [2] due to
matrix plugging, however a honeycomb structure can been used to counteract these
issues (‘plugging’ is a fouling phenomenon in which particles adhere to surface ele-
ments and so gradually block or ‘plug’ the flow path). There are also the possibilities
of cross-contamination between the streams and gas leakages. Also, since there is a

2.1 Burner and Air Preheaters
75
continuous heating and cooling cycle, high thermal stresses occur within the regen-
erator and as such can lead to cracking or degradation of the matrix. Flexible seals
act to minimise these leakages, but reliability is still a concern. Because of the risk,
only applications where some cross-contamination is acceptable between streams
can use these designs. Self-cleaning has been applied to reduce the impact of fouling
and some designs have purge sections which remove contamination, such as partic-
ulates, before they enter the different stream. However, and notwithstanding these
problems, the benefits of this system are the relatively high efficiencies.
The general equation for heat transferred from the fluid to heat sink matrix is:
∝A(Tfluid −Tsolid) = Mcs
𝛿Ts
𝛿t
(2.5)
where ∝is the bulk heat transfer coefficient (W/m2/K), M is the mass of solid heat
sink (kg) behind the surface area (A) exposed to the heating fluid (m2), T is the abso-
lute temperature (K), 𝛿is the thickness of heat sink (m), and t is time (seconds).
2.1.2.2
Static Regenerators
Static, or fixed bed, regenerators use two or more operating regenerators that
operate out of phase. The regenerator heat sink can be enclosed within a duct or
pipes and the valves switch the flow of the two streams resulting in one storing
energy and the other extracting it. These tend to be for very high-temperature
applications and require a refractory or ceramic heat sink. These need to withstand
thermal stresses, corrosive environments, and particulate loading. An example of
static regenerators is seen in Section 2.1.2.3.
2.1.2.3
Regenerative Burners
Like recuperative burners, regenerative burners work in a repeating cycle preheat-
ing the combustion air but typically using alternating burners operating in pairs.
One burner fires, and the exhaust gases pass through a port in the second burner
body to a HEX medium – predominantly, 2–3 cm ceramic alumina balls [13]. The
medium extracts and temporarily stores the heat energy from the exhaust. Once the
medium reaches a set temperature (or periodically), the fuel exhaust and air valves
reverse the direction of their flow so that the combustion air of the second burner
now passes through this hot medium and is preheated. As with recuperative burn-
ers, the burner combustion efficiency is increased because the flame is hotter and so
a greater enthalpy content entering the combustion chamber – the repeating cycle
leading to lower fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions per unit of heat. Liter-
ature reports that fuel consumption can be reduced by as much as 40–45% [14, 15].
Due to their design, regenerative burners are more suited to high-temperature
recovery and can obtain higher efficiency as they recover more heat than recupera-
tive burners. Preheating combustion air efficiency improvements are seen in Section
2.1.4. A fan is required to draw the exhaust gases through the unit as there is a higher
resistance. There is a non-steady flow due to the cyclic nature of operation but also
the preheat temperature of the combustion air decreases over each half-cycle as the

76
2 Waste Heat Recovery
energy content is removed from the thermal medium. Advantageously, these burn-
ers are very suitable for dirty exhaust gases as the burner is less prone to clogging if
thermal media is used as the initial capture. However, this does mean that the burner
medium requires maintenance and the regular removal of particulates.
If not present in the original design for a process, retrofitting these burners
requires modifications to the system with the installation of increased pipework,
ductwork, and controls. The majority of applications use a dual burner system, but
self-regenerative burners exist as well as other minor system variants [16]. These
are more compact, made so by the integration of two units into one and a burner of
this type using a ceramic honeycomb heat transfer medium has been developed by
NKK [17].
There are conflicting reports of regenerative burner success:
●Voyer and Caron [18] built an energy-efficiency model and determined that instal-
lation of regenerative burners was cost-effective for melting furnaces but not for
holding furnaces.
●Schalles [19] reports short return on investment (ROI) periods, reduction in CO2
emissions, and the maintenance being a minor consideration when taking fuel
savings into account.
●Hassan and Al Kindi [14] report that regenerative burners are not profitable for
saving energy when applied to aluminium holding furnaces and have a negative
effect on the life of the furnace.
Table 2.4 provides a list of regenerator applications with technology, type of oper-
ation, and source and sink fluids.

regenerative burner technology.

Though not directly related to heat recovery, the formation of NOx compounds goes
hand in hand with burner technology. The majority of the relevant discussions are

The reaction mechanisms are extremely complex with many pathways, so the
equations presented subsequently only show the overall reactions without the inter-
mediate pathways. Nitrogen in air is relatively stable; however, at high temperatures
it can react with oxygen to form NOx molecules. The subscript, x, depends on the
amount of oxygen that reacts with the nitrogen. The majority is NO (95–99%) with
NO2 forming 1–5% [20].
N2 + O2 →NO + N
(2.6)
N + O2 →NO + O
(2.7)
N + OH →NO + H
(2.8)
These molecules are detrimental to the environment as they can form smog and
ozone, and as such, the concentrations that can be released to the atmosphere are
heavily regulated. They are thought to contribute to 30% of acid rain formation [20].
Increasing the flame temperature can cause an increase in NOx formation as the
activation energy for the reaction is more readily reached. Significant work has been
done on the design of burners to reduce the formation of NOx to develop more envi-

Run-Around Coil
A run-around coil (RAC) can be used for liquid or air preheating purposes but tends
to be used to recover heat from the exhaust of an air handling system to preheat the
supply air. They are also named run-around loops or pump-around coils. They are a
sensible HEX as they do not change moisture content, only the temperature of the
airstreams.
The system preheats air by pumping a heat transfer fluid between two HEXs [21].
A hot stream is passed through a HEX which warms the heat transfer fluid. The
heat transfer fluid is circulated to a further HEX where cooler air is passed through,

extracting the energy from the heat transfer fluid. The now cool fluid continues to be
pumped to the first HEX and the cycle repeats. A RAC is chosen if the heat streams
are at separate locations or at a distance from each other for practical or safety rea-
sons. Energy is required to pump the fluid so there are losses in the pipework and
low effectiveness has been reported [9], 40–60% being typical [9].
The HEXs used for the loop are multi-row tube coils with fins to direct the fluid
and increase the heat transfer surface. The heat transfer fluid is normally water due
to the temperature range targeted but can contain glycol to prevent freezing. This
can have an adverse effect by increasing the resistance within the system. However,
RACs do have the advantage that no cross-contamination is possible and the cost of
pipework is low in standard sizes.
The working fluid is the main consideration when looking at this application as
higher temperatures require the use of organic or other fluids which can thermally
degrade or change phase. Higher temperature applications require design changes
such as the removal of fins in favour of a spiral around the ductwork, and higher
temperature applications only show a 10–15% effectiveness [9] – much lower than
using water as a working fluid.
2.2
Heat Exchangers
A HEX, as the name suggests, is simply a device used to transfer heat from one fluid
(typically a liquid or a gas) to another fluid, but (in most cases) without the two
fluids having to mix or come into contact with each other. For example, consider
the exhaust gases from a power plant. Rather than venting these hot fumes to the
atmosphere, we might be able to recover some of their heat by using a HEX.
Heat transfer is a fundamental discipline of engineering and of particularly rele-
vance for example, in the design of refrigeration systems; in establishing the overall
energy balance for a building and hence its heating or cooling load; in the use of elec-
trical equipment such as generators, motors, and transformers where the removal of
the heat produced as a by-product of their operation is essential to help limit their
operating temperatures, and many other applications. They come in many sizes and
configurations but typically they all share a common principle of operation – a solid
wall (usually metallic for high thermal conductivity) separating the two moving flu-
ids, one gaining heat (from heat flowing through the wall) whilst the other loses
its heat.
As mentioned, HEXs come in many forms and can be classified in a number of
ways. For example, by transfer process, number of fluids, surface compactness, flow
arrangement, and the like. Figure 2.7 shows a common method of classification – by
construction, a few examples of which we will consider in greater detail within this
chapter.
2.2.1
Shell and Tube HEXs
A common class of HEX is the shell and tube exchangers, typically used in the
petrochemical industry and the nuclear power generation industry and suited to

high-pressure applications. As the name implies it essentially comprises a large pres-
sure vessel (the shell) with a large number or ‘bundle’ of tubes passing through it,
these can be either plain or finned. One fluid flows through the tubes, whilst the sec-
ond fluid flows through the shell surrounding the tubes and so heat exchange takes
place between them.
2.2.1.1
Construction
The various possible contact patterns between the shell and tube bundle are denoted
by a pair of numbers (1–2, 1–4, 2–4, etc.), the first number denoting the number of
shell passes and the second the number of tube passes (for each tube of the bun-
dle) – the term ‘pass’ representing flow from one end of the HEX to the other – and
there are two methods of mounting the tubes: (i) straight tubes arrangements and
(ii) U-tube arrangements. However, irrespective of the tube mounting method, an
odd number of tube passes are rarely used due to expansion as a result of temper-
ature change, an odd number making the associated stress problems are harder to
manage [22].
Fixed tubesheet and floating head are both examples of straight tube exchangers
and both have plenums at each end to allow the tube fluids to make another pass.
The fixed tube version has its straight tubes fixed at each end making it the simplest
and cheapest form of construction but it means that the outside of the tubes cannot

be mechanically cleaned. The floating head version is more versatile in that one of
the tube-sheets is free to float within the shell to allow for tube expansions as shown
in (Figure 2.8). This also ensures cleaning of both the inside and outside of the tubes
is possible.
U-tube HEXs, as the name suggests, are where the tubes are bent into a
‘U’-shape to make the necessary number of tube passes and are intermediate in
cost (Figure 2.9). The tube bundle can be removed but only the tube exterior can be
mechanically cleaned.
In addition to their tube arrangements, shell and tube HEXs also possess other
essential features such as their baffles. These are used to support the tube bundle,
reduce vibration, and prevent tube sagging, but importantly they also establish a
turbulent flow regime which helps enhance convective heat transfer. The baffles

strengthen the tubes for high-pressure applications
than the shell
Flows requiring low-pressure drop – tube-side
pressure drop is usually greater than shell-side, so
less viscous fluid should pass through the tubes
Cooling water
can also be arranged in a number of ways, for example when used for sensible heat
transfer (heating or cooling) the baffle ‘cut-away’ should be horizontal, whilst for
shell – side condensation a vertical cut-away is better.
The choice of which fluid flows through the tubes is largely governed by the prac-
ticalities of maintenance and operation. Table 2.7 highlights typical fluid allocations.
2.2.1.2
Applications and Limitations
Shell and tube HEXs are typically used for high pressure (>30 bar) and high tem-
perature (>260 ∘C) applications, but as with all HEX construction, materials may
also play a major role in the selection process especially if thermal and/or structural
stress effects need to be considered. Usually these do not pose any serious problems
at pressures below 15 bar and temperatures below 150 ∘C, but at pressures above
70 bar and temperatures above 550 ∘C material choices can be very limited.
Temperature differences between the tubes and shell may also cause problems
especially where the temperature difference is greater than 50 ∘C. A large tempera-
ture difference can cause thermal expansion problems. Also, as you might expect
in the case of corrosive fluids, there will be a need to select corrosion-resistance
materials such as stainless steel or titanium to provide longer in-service component
lifetimes; or a leak-proof construction as required where toxic or very expensive flu-
ids are involved. Finally, despite their extensive use, shell and tube HEXs are not
suitable for use in the transport industries (automotive and aircraft) due to their
large size and weight.
2.2.2
Plate Heat Exchanger
The plate HEX (PHE) is a widely used, more compact form of HEX and consists of
a number of thin rectangular corrugated or embossed metal plates, sealed around
the edges, and held together in a frame. They are used to transfer heat between two
(or more as shown in Figure 2.10) fluids and have the advantage that the fluids are

exposed to a large surface area which increases the heat transfer rate. They are suit-
able for medium- and low-pressure applications and are available in a wide range
of sizes, for instance, very small versions are being used in the hot water section of
domestic combination boilers to ensure a good flow rates [24].
Plate surface formations have evolved over the years to enhance heat transfer coef-
ficients and reduce unit size, and are typically manufactured from stainless steel or
titanium to produce units with operating limits between –35 and 220 ∘C with operat-
ing pressures up to 25 bar and flow rates up to 5000 m3/h. By using brazed plates, the
operating limits can be extended from −195 to 200 ∘C and pressures up to 30 bar, but
the plates can then only be cleaned by applying chemicals. Welded-plate exchangers
allow even greater temperatures (dependant on the materials) and pressure limits of
up to 60 bar.
2.2.2.1
Spiral Plate Heat Exchanger
One variation of the PHE is the spiral PHE. Formed from two long strips – typically
of carbon steel, stainless steel, or titanium – the strips, as the name suggests, are
wrapped to form concentric spirals with normal operating limits up to 400 ∘C and
pressures up to 25 bar (Figure 2.11).
2.2.3
Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger
A heat pipe HEX (HPHE) is another heat transfer device but this time relying on
both thermal conductivity and a phase change (change of state) between a liquid
and a gas.
A typical heat pipe consists of three sections: a condenser, an evaporator, and an
adiabatic section. The tube is hermetically sealed and partially filled with a liquid.
When the evaporator section is placed within a hot stream, the liquid will vapourise,
the vapour then travels along the pipe and condenses back to a liquid at the cooler
end of the pipe (condenser section) releasing its latent heat to pass through the walls

of the tube and so transferring heat. The condensed liquid then returns to the evap-
orator section of the tube though either capillary action, centrifugal force, or gravity
and the cycle repeats.
Heat pipes are fast acting and very effective thermal conductors owing to the very
high thermal heat transfer coefficients for vapourisation and condensation, but the
working fluid must be chosen so that the pipe contains both liquid and vapour over
its operating temperature range, examples of which are noted in Table 2.8.
Pipe materials are typically copper for water heat pipes or aluminium for ammo-
nia heat pipes and although not essential, they invariably operate under vacuum or
partial vacuum conditions. It is important to note that the pipe must contain both
saturated liquid and vapour to transfer heat (Figure 2.12).

A heat pipe contains no mechanically moving parts and so requires minimal main-
tenance, although over its life, its effectiveness may reduce due to breakdown of the
working fluid, impurities absorbed from the tube wall, or scaling effects on the out-
side of the tube wall. However, their advantages over other forms of HEXs are their
speed and high efficiency at transferring heat with only a comparatively small tem-
perature differential being necessary for operation.
2.2.4
Compact HEX
HEXs classified as being ‘compact’ are those that are manufactured with a large ratio
of heat transfer surface area to volume – a ratio known as the ‘area density’ or surface
compactness (𝛽); resulting in smaller and lighter HEX modules. They are commonly
used for gas-to-gas and gas-to-liquid (or liquid-to-gas) HEXs in order to counteract
the low heat transfer coefficients associated with gases.
Of course, ‘compactness’ is a matter of degree. Typical compact heat transfer sur-
face area to unit volume ratios for compact liquid exchangers are those where the
beta values are in excess of 400 m2/m3, whilst for gases, the beta values are those in
excess of 700 m2/m3. However, that is not the whole story, for laminar flow or ‘meso’
HEXs beta values are greater than 3000 m2/m3, and the term ‘micro’ HEX is used
where the surface area density is greater than 15 000 m2/m3. In contrast, a typical
industrial shell-and-tube exchanger has a surface density of less than 100 m2/m3.
Basic flow arrangements for two-fluid stream compact HEXs are invariably:
single-pass cross-flow, single-pass counter-flow, and multi-pass; the latter two lead-
ing to highly effective units or for situations with a small temperature differential
between the fluid streams. However, there are a number of important design and
operating considerations relating to extended surface compact HEXs that need to
be considered:

86
2 Waste Heat Recovery
●Usually at least one of the ‘fluids’ is a gas
●Fluids should be ‘clean’ and non-corrosive
●Operating pressures, temperature, and relative required pump power are limited
compared to shell-and-tube exchangers
●The use of a highly compact surface results in a design which typically has a large
facing area and short flow length, hence the design of the header for the liquid
fluid is critical to ensuring a uniform flow distribution through a large number of
small flow channels.
Fouling or scale formation can also be a potential problem as many fin geome-
tries cannot be mechanically cleaned adding additional operating costs for chemical
cleaning.
2.3
Waste Heat Boilers
WHR is a method of thermal absorption, that is, the reuse of heat energy that would
be either disposed of or actually emitted into the atmosphere. Implementing recu-
peration of waste heat, plants will minimise energy costs and reduce CO2 emissions,
whist, at the same time, also increasing energy efficiency [27]. WHR techniques such
as waste heat boilers (WHBs) implement the collection of the waste heat so as to
ensure the optimal performance of the WHR process [28]
WHBs on industrial plants recover heat produced in furnaces or exothermic chem-
ical reactions and are employed because these are locations that can contain a con-
siderable amount of thermal energy that should not be released into the atmosphere.
For example, in a standard coal power plant the hot exhaust gas produced from the
combustion process after leaving the combustion chamber has a temperature of up to
1000 ∘C [29].This heat could then be collected in a WHB to produce low-to-medium
pressure steam. WHBs may also be utilised to extract heat from the process fluids
which require cooling prior to transport and storage.
The steam produced in WHBs may be used for heating purposes, for turbines
generating electricity, compressing vapours, or for pumping liquids. However, the
steam from the WHBs may contain substantial moisture, therefore it is necessary
to install a high-performance separator in combination with a ventilation system to
ensure that the waste heat boiler provides maximum steam quality to the receiving
process [30].
WHBs consist of multiple water tubes which are positioned parallel to one another
and follow the direction of heat exiting the system as shown in Figure 2.13. WHBs
are available in a number of capacities, allowing gas intakes from 1000 to 1 million
ft3/min (0.47–470 m3/s). But also, in situations where the waste heat is not adequate
to produce the required amount of steam, it is possible to install auxiliary burners
or after-burners to achieve a higher steam performance. The steam produced can
be used either for process heating or for power generation, but the generation of
superheated steam would involve the installation of an additional superheater to
the system [31].

WHBs can also be combined with other WHR devices, such as after-burners, pre-
heaters, and finned–tubed evaporators, to increase their performance by preheating
the feed water and, if possible, to generate superheated steam [28]. Moreover, an
economiser can be added to preheat the feed water before it enters the evaporator,
that will boost the steam flow from the heat recovery boiler [32] – economisers being
a type of HEX that transfers heat to boiler feed water whilst cooling gases entering
intermediate and final absorption towers [33]. WHBs focus primarily on heat trans-
fer convection; the gas velocity and the draught loss are both high for high transfer
rates [28]. As a result, an induced fan is normally mounted with a WHB to collect
and expel flue gas from combustion chambers by producing a region of negative air
pressure [34].
2.3.1
Different WHB Designs
WHBs can be classified into several types based on their usage and applications
such as:
1. Water tube boilers: for clean or dusty flue gas.
2. Gas tube boiler: for relatively clean flue gases.
3. Bent tube boiler: suitable for heavy dusty gases.
4. Positive circulation boiler: for clean and low-temperature gases.
5. Supercharged boiler: for gas turbine exhaust.
6. Three-drum-low-head boiler: suitable for light and dusty loading.
7. Water wall bidrum-type boiler: for gases that comprise sticky particles.
When selecting the correct and applicable WHBs type, the following criteria needs
to be considered: heat load, temperature of the gases available for WHR for steam

88
2 Waste Heat Recovery
generation, chemical nature and the corrosiveness of the gases, available draught,
dust load, chemical composition of the gases, pressure exerted, and the available
footprint.
However in most instances, water tube boilers are more commonly applied for
WHR due to their vessels’ ability to withstand extremely high pressures without a
reduction in efficiency. In addition, these boilers have the ability to endure thermal
shock due to changes in gas temperature because the wall of the furnace can be
efficiently cooled by adding water wall tubes. Moreover, since water is circulated in
the tube side, and can be easily maintained, water tube WHBs are not susceptible to
damage in cases of poor feed water quality. Other benefits of their construction are
that issues of sluggishness and degradation can be reduced by adjusting the size and
spacing of the tubes and maintenance more easily facilitated because dust particles
may also be retrieved.
Approximately, 95% of the heat generated in the steam is wasted by the gases pass-
ing through the boiler and it can be deduced from Eq. (2.9) [28]:
Heat lost by hot gases = V ∗s (T1 −T2) MJ∕s
(2.9)
where V = m3 gas/s and s is the specific heat.
Heat absorbed by water = 0.95 V ∗s(T1 −T2) MJ∕s
(2.10)
where, T1 and T2 are the temperature of hot gases before and after the waste heat
boiler in ∘C.
Overall, the total heat as steam can be deduced from the summation of the sensible
heat in feed water and the heat absorbed by water in boiler [28].
2.3.2
WHB Methodologies
Waste heat boiler deployment has been playing a vital role in industry. Currently,
WHBs are commonly used in the chemical, energy, medicine, and fuel industry to
recover waste heat from flue gas [35, 36].
2.3.2.1
Feed Water Preheating Effect
Feedwater heating is important in some situations to prevent condensation of sul-
furic acid in the boiler, sulfuric acid in the exhaust gas being formed by the sulfur
content of the fuel. A study investigated the effect of feed water heating on a specific
WHB. The feed water is fed into this boiler at the gas outlet and passes through the
centre until it leaves the other end in the desired state (superheated).
The conditions of the steam exiting are regulated by the rate of flow for the
feed water because low water flow rates yield high superheat, high minimum
wall temperatures, and poor heat recovery. This control function was used, for
this analysis, to achieve optimum heat recovery at an appropriate lower wall
temperature [37], and the effect of WHB weight and volume on the outcome of a
LM2500-based combined gas and steam turbine system (COGAS) was studied. The
boiler was controlled to extract the maximum heat from the gas turbine exhaust
whilst maintaining an acceptable minimum wall temperature. At a gas turbine

2.3 Waste Heat Boilers
89
power of 8.95 MW, the boiler – without feed water heating – produced sufficient
steam to generate 2120 kW at a turbine efficiency of 80%. The boiler, including
diffuser, weighed 8770 kg. The steam power was then improved to 2980 kW with a
boiler weight of 17 400 kg when the feed water is heated. The respective 24% and
33% increase in power for these two systems converts into a 15% and 20% rise in
fuel usage over the LM2500 gas turbine at higher COGAS power levels. At a lower
power stage, all COGAS systems produced a 20% increase in fuel consumption over
the standard gas turbine. Overall, it was observed that feed water heating allows
more heat to be extracted from the gas turbine [37].
2.3.2.2
Optimising Thermodynamic Cycles
Industries use WHR boilers for the flue gas from diesel engine. The combustion
of fuel in an engine normally resulting in 30–40% of heat energy being emitted by
flue gas, increases the industrial application of heat recovery boilers for energy
savings [38]. For example, the floating production storage and offloading Facility
(FPSO) is a facility floating above sea level for the initial manufacture, storage,
and discharge of crude oil. FPSO has the combined functions of production,
accommodation, and management of petroleum products for its employees and
many diesel engines are used to supply power to the FPSO needs.
For the purpose of recovering the released waste heat, waste heat recovery boilers
(WHRBs) are regularly employed with diesel engines. However, due to the limited
space on a FPSO, the design and installation of WHRBs are relatively challenging.
Liu et al. [39] demonstrated a theoretical analysis and carried out onsite tests on
the thermal performance of a WHR system for offshore oil production facilities, and
these included the components of diesel engines, thermal boilers, and WHBs. A stan-
dard Brayton cycle was used to investigate the thermal performance, but compared to
a conventional configuration, the fans of the WHRB engine outlet were removed due
to the restricted capacity of the offshore platform. Cases with and without the addi-
tion of a fan were correlated with the system’s output in terms of thermal stability,
energy consumption, and thermoeconomic index.
As illustrated in Figure 2.14, the FPSO system contains diesel engines, WHRB and
thermal oil boilers. For power generation, the crude oil was used as the fuel for the
diesel engines. Generally, as in this case, the high-temperature gas in the range of
350–400 ∘C is normally discharged into the atmosphere.
But with the modification, the gas emitted from the diesel engine is transferred
into the WHRB to heat the medium hot oil. The distance between the exhaust man-
ifold of each engine and the WHRB can be more than 10 m depending on the local
circumstances, even so, under standard operation conditions, the WHRB will still
provide adequate heat to satisfy the thermal demand of FPSO, the thermal boilers
only being started when the heat supply is inadequate. These two types of boilers
are mounted in parallel and the WHRB installation is shown in Figure 2.15. Each
WHRB being fitted with a single diesel engine to prevent inter-relationships between
different diesel engines. After installation of the WHRB and the silencer, the flue gas
from the diesel engine is supplied to the WHRB under standard operation. A bypass

pipe was also attached for safety in the event the system is operated at much higher
capacity than the designed value.
The findings indicate that the WHRB procedure improves the energy consumption
of the whole system but raises the flow resistance inside the duct. As the WHRB takes
the place of the thermal boiler, the energy consumption of the whole system without
a fan is marginally decreased but the heat recovery performance is increased. So in
all, this research offers valuable guidelines for optimising the recovery of waste heat
for offshore oil production plants through the use of WHRB.

2.3 Waste Heat Boilers

2.3.2.3
Heat Recovery Boiler with Water Spray Systems
The demand for high thermal performance coupled with the low emission of con-
taminants is growing for all thermal systems that use fossil fuels. Gaseous fuel sys-
tems have some benefits in terms of emitting filterable particulate matter (PM) as a
solid or aerosol from the exhaust stack; nonetheless, they may still emit large quan-
tities of NOX, which will gradually be converted into atmospheric PM by secondary
processes within the atmosphere [40]. NOx emissions from industrial boilers are
mostly regulated using after-treatment facilities such as selective catalytic reactors
(SCRs) to maintain their stricter specifications. However, domestic and commercial
NOx boiler emissions can have a significant PM forming effect because small boil-
ers are not ideal for SCRs [41]. Hence there is also a continuous need for advanced
technologies to maximise thermal efficiency and at the same time reduce total NOx
emissions without excessive post-treatments. In a study, Kim et al. [42] aimed at
exploring a thermodynamic analysis approach to assessing thermal efficiency and
to provide information on the power design requirements for each device compo-
nent. For the study, a chain-block structure analysis system was implemented using
water spray heat recovery boilers (HR-B/WS) where water is sprayed into the inlet
air stream and/or reaction field.
Design of Water Spray Heat Recovery Boilers Figure 2.16 indicates the proposed heat
recovery boiler with water spray (HR-B/WS) considered in the research. The basic
boiler subsystem (BBS) on the left comprises only the burner and primary HEX in the
combustion chamber. The heat recovery subsystem (X) on the right recovers waste
energy discharged from the BBS.
A counter-flow HEX (X) with air stream path (AX) and exhaust gas stream path
(GX) was also used. The waste energy stored in emission gas (EG) is transmitted by
a noncontact HEX into the inlet air system. To the bottom right, the water recircula-
tion subsystem (WRS) consists of a reservoir (R), pumps, and spray nozzles. Water
condensed at C and GX is held in the R and hot water is sprayed by recirculation
into the inlet airflow and reaction zone. The air and water mixture are heated in
the AX from hot exhaust gas. Inlet air is humidified by the evaporation of the small
droplets from the water stream, which requires a greater portion of the extracted
energy. Vapour in the preheated air reduces the temperature of the flame, reduc-
ing NOx emission similar to exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Water sprayed on the
combustion chamber also lowers the temperature of the component, which reduces
the production of NOx in the post-flame zone. The actual flow path lengths, includ-
ing air pipes, exhaust gas pipes, water feed lines, and the like, are ignored for the
thermodynamic analysis [43].
Subsequently, the suggested method of research was tested and the boiler system
was studied in operation. With the evidence of the study, HR-B/WSs are expected
to achieve up to 95% performance with decreased NOx emissions and additional
water spray to the combustion chamber can be a useful tool to minimise NOx emis-
sions whilst maintaining high performance when inadequate water is supplied to
the HEX. The current research therefore indicates that HR-B/WSs offer excellent
thermal performa nce and reduced NOx emissions.

Failure Modes
HEX tubes are a crucial component of any waste heat boiler, but they are often
exposed to demanding operation settings, including high temperature, high pres-
sure, corrosive flue gas, alkaline fly ash, and so on. Accordingly, HEX tubes of a waste
heat boiler frequently encounter severe failures; the typical failure causes found
in WHBs being categorised into the following classes: defects of the material [43],
high-temperature corrosion [44, 45], stress corrosion cracking (SCC) [46, 47], and
dew point corrosion [48, 49]
2.3.3.1
Failure Modes Analysis
A well-known German chemical corporation used a waste heat boiler to work with
waste methyl methacrylate (MMA) liquid from upstream facilities, not just using
exhaust gas, but also ensuring the pollutants were environmentally safe [50]. A
schematic of the industrial procedure of the waste to energy conversation with this
WHRB. As can be seen, the liquid waste collected by S-1930, atomised and mixed
with natural gas, is sprayed into the thermal oxidiser where the gas mixture burns
with preheated air producing high-temperature exhaust gas. The hot flue gas is then
treated with aqueous ammonia to remove the harmful nitrogen oxides and so make
it environmentally friendly. Afterwards, the gas flows through the waste heat boiler,
which is composed of evaporator X-1981, superheater X-1984, evaporator X-1982,
evaporator X-1983, and economiser X-1985, allowing the feed water to absorb latent
enthalpy from the hot gas.

At the end of the process, the low-temperature flue gas can be release into atmo-
sphere openly with minimal influences on the environment and the high-pressure
steam is transferred to downstream plants to be reused.
Frequent shell-side corrosion occurred on the economiser tubes of a waste heat
boiler and a series of analysis procedures were performed to investigate the root
cause of the corrosion. Both the macroscopic and microscopic properties of the failed
tubes were then closely studied followed by an investigation of the phase composi-
tions of their deposits and then an investigation which included the accurate deter-
mination of the sulfur and nitrogen content. The findings showed that repeated
failures were mainly due to sulfuric acid dew point corrosion and the sulfur was
mainly exposed from MMA pollution [50].
2.4
Heat Recovery Steam Generators
As a result of the recent developments and technological advancements within
the field of WHR, significant efficiency improvements can also be achieved for
energy-intensive industries. Recovering waste heat from industrial processes is
regarded as an ideal solution because it brings substantial financial or economic
saving benefits and helps with reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As described
by Jouhara et al. [51], there are various technologies and applications which offer
different techniques of WHR.
Unfortunately, and for all today’s extensive efforts towards energy production from
green and renewable sources, still nearly 70% of global power is produced from fossil
fuels. For instance, as has already been investigated, fossil fuels involve a large por-
tion of energy composition for many major industries, such as, food processing, pulp
and paper, chemicals, and primary metals production. This clearly indicates that the
employment of WHR technologies and applications show a promising solution to
help reducing the dependency on fossil fuels in the mentioned industries [51].
WHR systems take advantage of harnessing the energy that is lost due to the inef-
ficiencies of a process and converting this to useful energy. This, in return, improves
the net useful energy that can be utilised on a system and hence reduces the overall
amount of fuel consumption. Alternatively, the waste energy can also be absorbed
and then used to generate other forms of energy or be used to create other products
that can have a useful impact on the overall efficiency of the system [52–54]
A good example of such a technology is the waste heat recovery steam generator
or (HRSGs) which has been shown as an ideal solution for converting wasted heat
from the exhaust of a process to help produce steam. WHR steam generators use
several different components and HEXs to convert these wasted hot gases from the
stack to useful steam – the steam then being used for heating, processing, or even
generating electricity [55].
Investigations have shown that waste HRSGs can increase the energy efficiency of
an industrial process, which in turn brings significant economic and environmen-
tal benefits [56]. For instance, in a recent study conducted by Krishnan et al. [57],

nearly 371 MW of thermal energy was recovered from the exhaust of a factory flow-
ing at almost 700 kg/s that was cooled down by almost 400 ∘C. This clearly indicates
the huge advantage in employing waste heat steam generators for energy recovery,
especially from high quality and clean waste heat. Table 2.9 below shows the sources,
quality, and temperature ranges of different waste heat.
2.4.1
Construction of Waste HRSG
Waste HRSGs are mainly categorised into three different groups, namely single,
dual, and triple-pressure types, depending on the configuration and number of
drums and HEXs in the system. The cost of investment increases as the system gets
more complex, with the triple-pressure system being the most expensive. Having
noted that, the effectiveness of the system is also dependent on how many passes
the waste heat can go through, so a triple system offers the greatest efficiency.
Regardless of this, investigations have shown that a dual pressure system is the
most widely used because it offers a good balance between efficiency and cost [59].
Others have shown that firstly the detailed full design of any selected WHR steam
generator must be considered since the overall performance of the installation
entirely depends on the configuration and number of the components available
within it. And in order to produce an efficient and economically feasible system, the
quality and quantity of the exhaust gas must also be fully studied since this is the
parameter that guides the minimum heat exchange area of the system components.
Hence indicating the correct design parameters are essential in ensuring the maxi-
mum utilisation and steam generation from the system. In this regard, many studies
have been conducted which take into consideration different design parameters for
adopting a waste heat steam generator system within a manufacturing processes.
For instance, Nag and De [60] conducted investigation into the functionality and
performance of a WHR steam generator that can be used in a combination of a gas
and a steam power cycle and concluded that the entropy is decreased when the
system is being fully operated. Franco et al. [61] performed researches into different
designs of WHR steam generators and discovered that exergy losses can be reduced

2.4 Heat Recovery Steam Generators
95
based on the irreversibility of the process. And it also further evolved that combining
a WHR steam generator with a gas turbine can increase the efficiency of a system
by nearly 60%. Furthermore, and in a cogeneration setting, by employing more
advanced components, system efficiency can increase by up to 75%. Today, recent
advances in WHR steam generator design comprising a so-called ‘double-pressure’
system allows the capability of maximum heat recovery – the system incorporating
auxiliary heating unit and high-performance superheaters that can be used to
efficiently generate steam [59].
The first step therefore in designing a WHR steam generator is to indicate the
amount, quantity, and quality of steam required to be generated by the system. In this
regard, the temperature and flow rate parameters of the generated steam need to be
considered so that the sizing of the main system components such as the economiser,
evaporator, and superheater can be performed.
Additionally, WHR steam generators can be rather large in size and in this respect,
the method of construction and transportation of the system also needs to be taken
into consideration. For example, the size of a unit can be so significant that it could
potentially be made in several sections or modular parts to be assembled at a later
stage on site at the facility. Whereas smaller units can be transported to the site as
whole and in a fully assembled configuration [62].
There are many differing designs of WHR steam generators, but all follow a similar
operational methodology. The basic configuration includes a set of HEXs, placed at
the outlet of exhaust gases and which allow water circulation through them, so that
radiative and conductive heat transfer occurs from the exhaust outlet, through these
HEXs, allowing the water to be transformed into steam at high pressure [51].
2.4.1.1
HRSG Design and Construction
A typical WHR steam generator can comprise several pressurising segments, such
as low-, intermediate-, and high-pressure sections. Each of these typically include
an evaporator and steam drum components which transform water into steam. The
higher the number of WHR sections, the higher the efficiency of the system. After
the steam is generated at the final stage, it will then pass through a superheater
which ensures that the pressure and temperature of the generated steam exceeds
its point of saturation [63]. If the WHR steam generator needs to be switched off,
then a diverting valve can be placed at the inlet of the system to divert the outlet
exhaust flow to the stack.
There are usually four components included in a WHR steam generator, namely an
evaporator, steam drum, superheater, and economiser. This section will cover how
each these components plays its role within a WHR steam generator system [64].
2.4.1.2
Evaporator
The evaporator is the section in which the waste heat from the exhaust is turned
into steam. The segment contains a HEX that comprises several tubes in which
water is passed, and could be defined as the heart of the WHR system since it dic-
tates the overall steam generator configuration and performance. However, research

96
2 Waste Heat Recovery
has shown that the quantity of thermal energy removed by this segment is some-
what limited because the difference in the inlet and outlet temperatures of the fluid
through this stage are not significantly different to the saturation temperature at the
system pressure.
2.4.1.3
Superheater
The superheater component is typically placed at the first stage of a WHR steam
generator and directly faces the incoming hot exhaust gas. The component can be
described as the first layer of defence in terms of waste heat absorption and is used
not as an evaporator but rather as a dryer of the saturated steam that is diverted from
the steam drum. The component is connected directly to the steam drum and has
the role of topping up the amount of thermal energy absorbed by the evaporator by
increasing the temperature of the generated steam to reach the saturation point or
just beyond. In this regard, the design and size of the evaporator is directly dependent
on the type of the steam drum used.
2.4.1.4
Economiser
As apparent from the name of the component, the economiser is responsible for
improving the efficiency of waste heat absorption so making the system more eco-
nomical. With this in mind, the component is placed at the outlet of the waste heat
steam generator and is configured to preheat the water that is being fed into the
evaporator. Thus it acts as a last resort for absorbing any waste heat that could not
be picked up by the evaporator and thereby improving the overall efficiency of the
system. Like the superheater, the design of the economiser also depends on the type
and size of evaporator being used.
2.4.1.5
Steam Drum
Steam drums can be designed in the form of either high or low-pressure systems. The
component comprises several internal separators and channels which comprise var-
ious baffles and diverters. The channels within the drum allowing for the collection
and segregation of water from steam before entering the superheater HEX.
2.4.1.6
Evaporator Types
Evaporators come in different shapes and designs. The following are the commonly
used evaporator types which are available in different configurations and different
operational sizes [65]:
D-Frame The D-frame evaporator is the most compact type of evaporator and is ideal
for WHR steam generator infrastructures with smaller exhaust sizes as shown in
Figure 2.17. Thanks also to their compact components, the size of the HEX is con-
venient for transportation and so can be installed as a whole unit with no assembly
complications.

2 Waste Heat Recovery
I-Frame The I-frame evaporators are made of several axial or lateral sections and can
be used to recover any flow of waste heat, and the design of this particular type of
evaporator is very economical and practical to manufacture. The I-frame evaporator
HEXs can be made in arrangements of up to three rows of tubes and headers in each
bundle set as shown in Figure 2.17.
O-Frame The O-frame evaporator is the most conventional type of HEX used in
WHR steam generators as shown in Figure 2.17. The specific configuration of the
HEX allows the header of the unit to be used as a steam segregation device and
thanks to this unique design feature, several evaporator HEXs can be connected to
the same steam drum. The design makes this type of HEX suitable and simple to
assemble for larger WHR steam generators.
2.4.1.7
Horizontal Tube HEXs
Horizontal tube HEXs are found to be the cheapest types of design to manufacture.
The HEX employs several sets of large diameter horizontal tubes which are placed
in a specific arrangement to absorb the waste heat from flue gases. Having noted
that and the consequently large size of HEX, the assembly and transportation of a
system employing this type of HEX may be more complex and higher in cost [66].
2.4.1.8
Natural Circulation HRSGs
Natural circulation HRSGs comprise several stacks of tube HEXs that are placed ver-
tically perpendicular to the outlet of the exhaust path. This particular configuration
allows for water within the HEX to heat and then rise naturally to the header drum
through its change in density and unrestricted expansion, whilst at the same time,
getting replaced by a counter-flow due to gravity. This natural circulation within the
water/steam cycle brings several advantages to the overall performance of the system
[67], some of which are:
●There is no requirement for the installation of a circulation pump. This could
potentially make the system more reliable, cheaper and, in the longer term, save
money since less energy is consumed.
●The inlet duct to the HEX can be installed at a lower height or on ground level.
This allows for easier installation, and could also make for a more robust structure.
●If used for WHR from a furnace, the configuration create a naturally water-cooled
zone for the system
However, having indicated the advantages of natural circulation WHR steam gen-
erators, there are also several disadvantages associated with the system as indicated
below:
●The system has been shown to be more difficult and complex to disassemble and
clean
●The HEXs generally require regular cleaning and moving the tube banks is not
easy or, in some cases, not feasible.
●System start and heat-up may take much longer time to complete so lowering over-
all efficiency and also invoking a higher carbon footprint.
●Rapid processing with frequent stopping and restarts can result in the build-up of
deposits, fatigue, and leakages within the tubes.

2.4 Heat Recovery Steam Generators
99
2.4.1.9
Assisted (or Forced) Circulation HRSGs
Assisted circulation WHR steam generators are configured so that the stack of HEX
tubes are in a horizontal orientation but perpendicular to the incoming exhaust flow.
The HEXs in this system comprise an inlet and an outlet drum header – where water
is distributed inside and steam is generated. The order of the drums is arranged so
that steam can be generated by injecting or forcing water at the inlet drum that is
connected to several tube banks. The structure of the HEXs is supported by individ-
ual metallic sheets that are held in place by a steel support and which are usually
relatively tall. As apparent from the name of the system, there is also a need for recir-
culation pumps to move water from the lower level to the collector drums and direct
the water–steam mixture within the evaporators [68].
There are certain advantages associated with the use of assisted circulation WHR
steam generators which makes the technology a better option over naturally circu-
lated system. These benefits can include:
●More rapid start-up from cold so faster to reach operational running
●Quicker response to conditional changes of the flow of steam
●The system generally requires a lower water content and so offers a smaller carbon
footprint
●The system is compact in size and can be placed on a unit in cases where space is
restricted.
Conversely, the following disadvantages are associated with forced circulation
WHR steam generators:
●The need for circulation pumps to be integrated into the system, which ultimately
results in higher active energy consumption and potentially more maintenance
work
●The units are very tall in height and so may pose installation restrictions
●Because the HEXs are placed in a horizontal orientation, there is the potential for
the water within the tubes to dry, with the possibility of overheating, fatigue, and
eventually corrosion.
2.4.1.10
Tube Materials
HEX tubes can be made from various materials based on the temperature range at
which the system is being operated. The majority of WHR steam generators operate
in the relatively low- to medium-temperature range; however, the system can also
be used in combination with supplementary firing at higher temperature ranges.
The evaporator and economiser are usually made using carbon steel because these
components only have to deal with the lower temperatures within the system. But
having said that, higher alloy materials with a reduced wall thickness are often used
in order to reduce the cost of the system. In order to increase the rate of heat transfer
through the HEX the tubes are usually covered with helical fins. The superheaters
are constructed using T11 alloy tubes so that they can deal with higher ranges of
heat from the exhaust. We should also note however, that due to the occurrence
of oxide and carbon deposits passing through the exhaust, the tubes require
cleaning on a regular basis to reduce the reduction of heat transfer efficiency and
performance [69].

2.4.1.11
The ‘Pinch Point’ and Other Effects
There are many variables that dictate the energy balance of WHR steam generators,
but the pinch point analogy has been noted as a method that allows for the selection
of an appropriate temperature for the operation of the system. To explain this fur-
ther, e.g. if the pinch temperature for evaporation is not properly defined, then the
quantity of the energy recovered from the evaporator section can be limited because
both inlet and outlet temperatures to the HEX can be at their saturation temperature
relative to the system pressure. Therefore, the pinch point or more simply the opti-
mum operating temperature of one WHR system can be different to that of another,
and entirely depend on the heat source. In addition, this also affects the entire design
of the HEXs and the coils used within a system.
Investigators have therefore concluded that several different heat balance vari-
ables need to be taken into consideration when designing a WHR system and some
of these important parameters include the exhaust outlet mass flow rate and temper-
ature, the maximum and minimum steam generation flow and temperature require-
ments, exhaust thermal and pressure properties, and other limitations related to the
noise and emissions produced by the system. Based on these, if the desired output
from a system cannot be delivered, introducing an additional process – such as sup-
plementary firing – might be required [59, 70].
Supplementary Firing Supplementary or in-duct firing is a terminology that is used
to describe a configuration that can be integrated with the exhaust of a WHR steam
generator to provide additional output to the system if and when required. This can
increase the system output to a required rate and so can result in an increase in
efficiency.
Additionally, a supplementary firing system can also help generate more power
from a system, especially at peak times when higher demand is required The sup-
plementary firing configuration is usually placed at the exhaust of a WHR steam
generation system, and can be used to adjust the inlet heat and so throttle the amount
of flow generated to the WHR system. One obvious disadvantage associated with the
use of supplementary firing is that harmful emissions can be produced, which is not
usually the case with a typical standalone system.

Heat Pumps
2.5.1
Fundamental Principles of Heat Pumps
Heat pumps are essentially devices that absorb heat from one space and release it to
another. In theory, the process is the perfect reverse of the more commonly known
term ‘refrigeration’ – where the function is to extract heat from a space that requires
cooling, the function of the heat pump being to supply heat at an elevated tempera-
ture to a space that requires heating. That being said, reversible heat pumps can work
in either direction to provide heating or cooling to an internal space.
Looking at Figure 2.18, the two modes of operation are as follows.

2.5.1.1
Cooling Mode
Point A: Here the refrigerant is very cold and in liquid form as it enters the evaporator
coil inside the building. The hot air inside the building is forced over this coil and
loses its heat to the refrigerant.
Point B: The refrigerant leaving the indoor coil has now absorbed heat and so
vapourised and in this gaseous state enters the compressor.
Point C: Leaving the compressor, the pressurised refrigerant now moves to the out-
door condenser coil where it loses heat to the outdoor air and condenses back into
a liquid.
Point D: The still warm liquid now enters the expansion valve which allows the liquid
to expand – so reducing its pressure and lowering its temperature ready to absorb
heat again and repeat the cycle at point A.
2.5.1.2
Heating Mode
Note the reversing valve has rotated by 90∘which changes the direction of refrigerant
flow so that now at:
Point A: Having just left the expansion valve the liquid is at its lowest temperature
and is ready to absorb heat from the outdoor coil, so changing state back into its
vapour form, i.e. the outdoor coil is now acting as the evaporator.
Point B: Notice that the compressor still operates in the same direction and increases
the vapour temperature and pressure.
Point C: The hot vapour now passes to the indoor coil where it loses heat to the
building – i.e. the indoor coil is acting as the condenser – and in losing heat the
refrigerant condenses back to its liquid state.
Point D: The refrigerant leaves the indoor coil as a warm liquid ready to be expanded
and the cycle repeats.
If a heat pump is used in both winter and summer, the total energy exchange with
the external environment may approach zero [72], dependent upon the duration of

102
2 Waste Heat Recovery
the seasons. Nonetheless, it should be recognised that mechanical energy is pro-
vided to the heat pump during operation and so the heat exchanged with the indoor
environment needs to be considered as that producing a ‘useful effect’.
Accordingly, and as with refrigeration, the performance of a heat pump is
expressed as the ratio of useful heat transferred to work input by the coefficient of
performance (COP) defined from:
COPhp = h2−h3
h2−h1
(2.11)
where h1, h2, and h3 are the enthalpy conditions on a temperature–enthalpy dia-
gram (Figure 2.20), discussed in Section 1.2.4.3 for heating – and Section 1.2.5.2 for
cooling.
Irreversibility’s invariably reduce the ideal COP and these are due to a number of
reasons: friction loses, the slight cooling of vapour just after it leaves the compressor,
pressure loss across the expansion valve, outdoor temperature changes during the
time of exchanger operation, and the like. However, the COP is very influenced by
the temperature of external environment [72] (Figure 2.19).
2.5.2
Variation of Heat Pump System
A complete classification of heat pump types depends upon the parameter that
you are comparing – heat source, configuration, application, output, and the like.
Nonetheless, two common classifications methods are grouping according to (i)
heat sources or (ii) heat source/heat sink configuration (Figure 2.20). (A heat sink
is a thermal energy reservoir which can receive huge amounts of energy without a
significant change in its temperature. A heat source is a thermal energy reservoir
which can supply huge amounts of energy without undergoing a change in its
temperature.)

Typical heat pump classiﬁcations.
In terms of the most common measure of heat pump efficiency – COP – air source
heat pumps typically have COPs ranging from 2 to 4 – denoting that they supply
2–4 times more thermal energy than the electrical energy they consume. Water and
ground source heat pumps have COP values typically between 3 and 5 but, as noted
earlier, the COP of an air source heat pump reduces as the outside temperature drops,
so when comparing systems it is important to ensure that their ratings are based on
the same outside air temperature. For ground and water source systems, their COPs
do not vary so much because ground and water temperature tend to be more constant
and stable than air temperatures.
Using the source classification, we’ll now consider some common types of
heat pump.
2.5.2.1
Air Source Heat Pump System
Air is a common source for heat pumps which are used to meet the HVAC require-
ments of residential and light commercial applications. Whilst appearing as a free
thermal source, we need to remember that in temperate climates frost may accumu-
late on external heat transfer coils when the temperature falls below 2–5 ∘C requiring
a short-time reversal of the heat pump cycle and hence a loss in overall system effi-
ciency (Figure 2.21).
Regrettably, the performance of an air source heat pump reduces with decreasing
external temperature – at time of its greatest need, which then may require an addi-
tional supplementary oil-, gas-, or electrically powered device to cope with extremes
of weather condition.
2.5.2.2
Ground Source Heat Pump System
A ground source heat pump system uses the ground as a seasonal storage of solar
energy for its operation. At a depth of between 1 and 1.5 m there is much less vari-
ation in temperature change compared to outdoor air temperature changes, and in
addition, the ground temperature changes often lag the corresponding air changes.

Such conditions are therefore very favourable for extracting energy for both heating
in winter and cooling in summer (Figure 2.22).
Ground source heat pumps can be designed as a direct system or as an indirect
system using a secondary refrigerant as the transfer agent and pipes can be laid hori-
zontally or vertically dependent upon local geological conditions. Both methods tend
to be much more expensive that air source systems because of the extent of ground-
work and pipework, and coil leakages may lead to maintenance considerations in
the longer term (Figure 2.23).

2.5 Heat Pumps
105
Heat is extracted from the ground typically using glycol as the working fluid, but
operation is such that several hundreds of square metres of pipework are required
just to heat a single home, so in urban areas where space is usually at a premium,
vertical systems may be a more practical solution.
As a variation and in some countries – the United States, Canada, France, for
example – geothermal heat sources may be available which considerably raise the
COP due to their high and constant temperatures. However, such resources are often
localised and sited away from the main areas of high population density. In addition,
there may also be a high salt content leading to possible long-term deterioration and
fouling problems.
2.5.2.3
Water Source Heat Pump System
Water sources may also be suitable in some areas to act as heat pump sources. If, for
example, groundwater is available at a stable temperature between say 5 and 10 ∘C,
then this can be used to drive either an open or a closed heat pump system. With
an open system, groundwater (pumped to surface level) is then either discharged
to surface water or into a separate rejection well after use. Closed systems typically
use a working fluid evaporating in underground HEX coils or brine with a looped
pipework systems. The latter have a slightly lower COP but are easier to maintain.
A point to consider is that local water regulations may impose severe constraints
due to interaction with the water table and the possibility of ground and water pol-
lution.
Surface water, such as rivers and lakes, also make useful heat sources but can suffer
from the problem of freezing in winter.
Sea water is also another alternative (under certain conditions) for medium- and
large-scale heat pump installations because at a depth of between 25 and 50 m, the
sea temperature is constant at between 5 and 8 ∘C and so freezing is not generally a
problem.
2.5.2.4
Water Loop Heat Pump System
The idea behind the water loop heat pump system is to provide a simple but flexi-
ble decentralised approach to HVAC in multi-room buildings, using heat recovery
from lighting, occupancy, solar gains, and equipment heating gains, and distributing
this energy to where it is needed. Developed in the 1950s in the United States, they
became more popular in the 1990s mostly in the United States and Japan.
The principal components of the system are several small, self-contained,
reversible heat pump modules which are then connected together by a water
loop of uninsulated pipework through which water is continuously circulated and
maintained at a temperature typically between 18 and 32 ∘C.
Operation is successful because many large buildings have internal zones that
require cooling during occupied hours whilst, at the same time, the perimeter spaces
need heating. The closed water loop pipework provides water to the condenser coils
of the interior heat pumps – heat which would be normally rejected to a cooling
tower – and this heat is then used as the heat source for the evaporator coils of the
perimeter heat pumps. During peak winter conditions if the heat pumps cool the

106
2 Waste Heat Recovery
water below 18 ∘C, an electric heater or a gas or oil-fired boiler is used to maintain
the loop temperature. Conversely, during summer peak cooling requirements when
nearly all units are rejecting heat to the loop, a supplementary closed-circuit evapo-
rative cooler maintains the loop water at around 32 ∘C.
2.5.2.5
Exhaust Air System
Exhaust (ventilation) air is another common heat source for heat pumps in both resi-
dential and commercial buildings. The heat pump recovers heat from the ventilation
air and uses this to provide a base temperature for water and/or space heating. As
a disadvantage, the ventilation may be required to operate continuously during the
heating season or even throughout the year, and so for some large buildings such
systems are often used in combination with air-to-air heat recovery units.
2.5.2.6
Hybrid Heat Pump
As the name suggests, hybrid heat pump systems are a combination of boiler coupled
with either an air source or a ground source heat pump and are a logical step in
application as the world strives to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.
Generally, the heat pump is efficient enough to provide year-round heating and
hot water but if the external temperature drops too low, then the system intelligently
switches to the boiler, so keeping energy usage and costs to a minimum.
2.5.2.7
Solar-Assisted Heat Pumps
A solar heat pump is one which integrates the technologies of thermal solar panels.
Typically, the solar panels perform the function of the low-temperature heat source
and the heat produced then feeds the heat pump’s evaporator (Figure 2.24).
Solar source heat pumps invariably suffer from the same disadvantages as air
source heat pumps in terms of extreme variablility, so they usually require (except
in locations with high daily irradiance levels) a backup heat source, but in addition,
they also have very high capital cost implications.

Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have demonstrated their ability to convert ther-
mal energy directly into electrical energy through the Seebeck effect. TEGs have
emerged in the last decade as an encouraging alternative among other technologies
for green power production because of the unique advantages they present. TEGs
are environmentally friendly as they do not contain hazardous materials, they oper-
ate with no noise since they do not have mechanical processes or spinning parts and
can be made on a large range of substrates such as silicon, polymers, and ceramics.
TEGs are also position-independent, have a long working life, and are ideal for use
in bulk and compact applications.
When producing energy in a regular power stations, only approximately one-third
of the energy released from the fuel actually ends up in the electrical transmission
lines leaving the power plant, the rest of the energy is lost in the form of waste
heat [76]. Part of the problem is that the steam-powered turbine systems, used to
generate the majority of electricity, function by initially burning a fuel to generate
heat energy. This is followed by the conversion of this heat energy into mechanical
energy within the turbine, and finally turning the mechanical energy into electrical
energy with a generator [77].The ability to collect the heat lost in these processes
and convert this to usable electrical power would greatly increase the efficiency of
the electricity generation process. In addition, since this would also mean that less
fuel is used for the same quantity of electricity, we could lower carbon pollution – an
advantage to the improvement of the environment. Also, since TEGs generate elec-
trical energy from heat energy without the need for moving parts (such as turbines)
this eliminates additional maintenance and replacement costs.
In recent years, TEG systems have formed the focus of much research in the
recovery of waste heat due to their incomparable advantages: they produce electrical
energy without the need for moving parts thus no maintenance and other extra
costs are required. They have no scaling effects and so range in application from
micro generation in a restricted position to systems that generate kilowatts. At
the same time, one disadvantage for this technology is its low energy conversion
efficiency rate; moreover, TEGs require a relatively steady heat source. TEGs operate
by exploiting a temperature gradient between the two sides of the generator known
as thermoelectric effect or the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect is named after
the German physicist, Thomas Johann Seebeck, who was believed to first explain
it in the 1820s. However, recent work reveals that the Seebeck influence was first
observed 27 years before this [78].
TEGs can be used in a wide variety of applications, such as WHR [79] and solar
energy applications [80]. Indicative of this flexibility, one study has implemented
a multi-generation device coupled with a TEG installed on a biomass gasification
facility [81]. Whilst in another, TEGs have been applied to human energy harvest-
ing. In order to harvest body heat, a flexible TEG which uses eutectic gallium indium
liquid metal together with a high thermal conductivity elastomer was designed to
be used for wearable electronics [82]. In yet another application aimed at portable

108
2 Waste Heat Recovery
power generation, a triple micro combustor was designed and advanced, which con-
siderably enhanced the heat transmission from hot gases to thermoelectric modules
(TEMs) [83].
2.6.1
TEG – Working Principle
TEG systems consist of three main elements: A HEX which takes and absorbs the
heat and transfers it into the TEMs that generate electricity when a temperature
difference exists between their respective ends, and a heat sink to dissipate the addi-
tional heat from the TEMs.
The TEM itself contains many pairs of thermoelectric couples, each couple com-
bining a pair of p- and n-type elements, and the temperature differential between
the two sides of the generator is what drives the function of the TEGs showing the
principle behind this. If one side of a piece of metal is heated whilst simultaneously
cooling the other side, the electrons within the metal atoms on the hot side will have
more energy than the corresponding electrons on the colder side. This implies that
the hot electrons will have more kinetic energy than those on the cold side and as
a consequence, the hot electrons will tend to travel further towards the cold side
than the cool electrons travel towards the hot side. So eventually, the cool end of the
thermoelectric device becomes negatively charged and the hot end becomes posi-
tively charged [51]. The downside to this method is that the voltage produced is very
low and unfortunately this cannot be resolved simply by connecting groups of metal
parts together in series. This is because any wires used to connect them are also made
of metal, and they would also produce a voltage but in the wrong direction and so
oppose the voltages of the metal pieces.
The most successful approach to tackling this problem is to create a substance
that can conduct electricity by utilising substitute charged particles, i.e. particles
that behave as positively charged particles that then migrate from the hot side to
the cold side. In which case, if a chain of these new materials is connected together,
the voltages will be applied in sequence, enabling a reasonable amount of power to
be produced for the user. Products with this beneficial property are referred to as
semiconductors [84]
A further problem regarding thermoelectric devices is that materials that enable
electrons to flow efficiently are often also good heat conductors, meaning that the
temperature differential controlling the cycle is very quickly lost so causing perfor-
mance to decrease. Researchers are therefore challenged to identify products of low
thermal conductivity but strong electrical conductivity and have found one way to
do this is by utilising metal alloys. These can be used to form a grid of atoms of vary-
ing sizes which slow down the heat flow but still enable electrons to travel freely.
Similarly, certain combinations of nanoparticles can be used to trap and slow down
the heat. In general, the more connections or gaps that occur between the objects,
the slower the heat can travel.

2.6.2
The Seebeck Effect
The Seebeck effect explains the build-up of a potential gap (ΔV) through a semicon-
ductor (or conductor) because of the diffusion of the charge carriers over a temper-
ature gradient (ΔT = Thot −Tcold), encountered by the substance if one side of it is
heated or cooled. Charges move from the hot to the cold side, leading to a difference
in the amount of charge carriers and which is balanced by a developed resultant
internal electric field. The type of carrier for the majority charge specifying the sign
of this potential difference which, by nature, is defined by the potential of the cold
side in relation to the hot side [84]. The sign of the Seebeck coefficient therefore
indicating whether the substance in a conductor is p-type or n-type material – the
positive sign noting p-type, a negative denoting n-type material.
The Seebeck coefficient is a measure of the effect and is defined as the relationship
between the established theoretical differential and the implemented temperature
gradient, as can be seen in Eq. (2.12) [85]
S = −ΔV
ΔT
(2.12)
The temperature gradient (ΔT) has to be created between the sample’s two sides,
and the resulting voltage (ΔV) has to be determined by taking electrical connections
from those two sides.
2.6.3
The Peltier Effect
As stated earlier, Thomas Seebeck, the German physicist, conducted various elec-
tricity experiments in 1821 and discovered that electricity can flow through a circuit
consisting of two different conductors provided the junctions at which these conduc-
tors were linked were held at differing temperatures. However, Seebeck was unable
to explain the exact scientific theory behind this mechanism and wrongly deduced
that flowing heat produces the same outcome as flowing water.
In 1834, whilst studying Seebeck’s effect, Gene Peltier, a French physicist, discov-
ered that heat could be absorbed at one junction of dissimilar metals and released
at the other junction of the same circuit, and in the 1850s, William Thomson Lord
Kelvin was able to reproduce and validate the findings of both Seebeck and Peltier
and went on to establish the relationship between them. Nonetheless, this finding
was confined to a laboratory-based experiment until 1930, when Russian physicists
began re-investigating earlier thermoelectric effect experiments which then led to
the creation of practical thermoelectric instruments.
In practice, the Peltier effect is assumed to be the opposite of the Seebeck effect
[86]. The electrical current passing across the junction of the two materials produces
or absorbs heat in unit time at the junction to offset the gap in the chemical struc-
ture capacity of the two materials. All of which influenced the development of the
electronic refrigerator, known as the Peltier cooler.

110
2 Waste Heat Recovery
The Peltier effect occurs because the difference in total energy of the electrons
involved in the propagation of electrical current in the numerous conductors is sig-
nificant. Several factors, such as the energy spectrum of electrons, their movement
within the conductor, and the atoms scattered at the junction between two separate
conductors, all influencing the conductor.
The electrons travelling from one electrode to another (depending on the direction
of the electrical charge stream), then transfer their extra energy to the underlying
atoms (exude) or absorb energy from the surrounding atoms. Similar to the Seebeck
effect, the Peltier effect has the setback of low efficiency, but another drawback is that
the flowing current itself tends to generate a large volume of heat that accumulates
in the cycle of heat dissipation.
This results in an excessive volume of heat in larger-scale applications, which
could mostly be taken care of by external fans but, as a consequence, more electric-
ity would be consumed, making the application very expensive and so eliminating
its wide-scale implementation. Furthermore, if the components of the Peltier device
are too cold, they may cause a short circuit due to condensation.
The main advantage of the Peltier effect is that it enables the production of cooling
and heating systems that do not need moving parts; thus, these systems are less likely
to fail compared with conventional coolers and heaters and so may not need mainte-
nance. Also when working, Peltier instruments operate silently and can potentially
exceed temperatures as low as −80 ∘C, allowing the Peltier effect to be productively
used at a microscopic level where conventional cooling methods will not work [87].
2.6.3.1
Applications of the Peltier Effect
Commonly used appliances that utilise the Peltier effect include a Peltier heater, a
heat pump cooler, and a solid-state refrigerator, all possible because as electrical cur-
rent flows through a Peltier device from one side of the panel to another it can act
to either heat or cool because all Peltier devices work by using electric current to
transfer heat from one side of the system to the other towards the temperature gra-
dient. Peltier effect devices have been used in dehumidifiers for the elimination of
water from the air (water extraction) and for DNA synthesis, where a thermal cycler
utilises the effect for the DNA synthesis process. In fact, astronauts also employ
the Peltier effect to counteract the uneven direct sunlight influences on their body,
which serves to dissipate heat from intense sunlight on one side of the astronaut to
the other which, not being in direct sunlight, is very much colder [88].
2.6.4
Thomson Effect
Thompson suggested that when the current passes through unequally heated con-
ductors, the thermal energy is absorbed or produced in the metallic structure [89] or,
in other words the Thomson effect is the generation of ‘reversible’ heat by an elec-
trical current transmitted through a conductive material subjected to a temperature
gradient [90]. The Thomson effect describes the heat escape from a substance with
a current flowing through it, and this heat flow is easily detectable. It is different

from the results of Peltier and Seebeck, by which only the cumulative impact of two
separate materials can be observed.
Figure 2.25 displays the copper bar (AB) heated at the middle (point C) with cur-
rent flowing from point A to point B. With no current flowing, points M and N (both
equivalent distant from point C) are both at the same temperature, but with a current
flowing from point A to point B, point N reaches a higher temperature than point M
and, similarly, point B reaches a higher temperature than point A. We can therefore
deduce that heat is generated from point A to point C, and heat is absorbed from
point C to point B. This is known as positive Thompson effect. Similar effects are
observed in the case of antimony, silver, zinc, and cadmium. However, in the case
of iron, with the bar heated at point C and the current still flowing from point A to
point B, the temperature at point M becomes higher than point N, which implies
that the opposite effect is occurring, i.e. that heat transferring from point A to point
C and from point C to point B. And this is termed as negative Thompson influence.
Similar effects are found with platinum, bismuth, cobalt, nickel, and mercury [89].
As a measure of this effect, the amount of heat energy absorbed or evolved when
1 A current flows for one second (i.e. 1 C) in a metal between two points which differ
in temperature by one degree Celsius is known as the Thomson coefficient [91].
2.6.5
Joule Heating
James Prescott Joule first researched and described heating phenomenon around
1840. Originally, Joule set out to explore how the recently invented electric motor
could be made more efficient than the steam engines in operation at the time and
this led him to perform a series of studies on the production, transfer, and use of
energy and mechanical work that eventually contributed to the first law of thermo-
dynamics.
The study of the interaction between an electrical current that passing through a
conductor and its increase in its temperature being one of these studies. The proce-
dure consisted of a wire submerged in water and attached to a battery terminal, and
when the circuit was energised the increase in water temperature was measured.

112
2 Waste Heat Recovery
Analysis of the recorded data led to the original form of the relationship now known
as Joule’s first law, that ‘the heat developed (per second) in the wire is proportional
to the resistance of the wire and to the square of the current’.
Joule heating (also known as ohmic heating) describes the method of transform-
ing the energy of an electric current into heat as it passes through a resistance. No
matter whether the electric current passes through a solid or liquid with limited con-
ductivity, electrical energy is still transformed into heat through resistive material
losses.
The heat is produced on the microscale because the conduction electrons transfer
energy to the conductor’s atoms by way of collisions, and with an electrical current,
I, flowing through a conductor, the heat ̇QJ generated within it (by virtue of the Joule
effect) is given by:
̇QJ = I2R
(2.13)
where R represents the electrical resistance [92].
Several home appliances use this heating function – electric irons, electric toasters,
and the like. Applications of Joule’s heating effect also include electric fuses, elec-
tric furnaces, and incandescent lamps. This latter application consists of a tungsten
filament which is placed inside a glass bulb and heated by the current to the point
where the filament glows white hot. Electric discharge lamps, electric welding, and
electric arc also utilise the heating effect of current.
2.6.6
Theoretical Principle
TEGs offer a perfectly competitive, solid-state system for energy conversion and by
using thermoelectric materials can be an alternative to conventional heat generation
engines, especially in lightweight heat recovery systems. The maximum efficiency
for the conversion of thermoelectric energy is typically presented in terms of the
temperature of each heat reservoir and a figure of merit (zT), and since a rise in zT
would contribute to an improvement in the performance of thermoelectric technol-
ogy, significant attempts have been made to incorporate and construct products with
high zT values.
2.6.7
Figure of Merit
Successful TE products should possess the following:
●High electrical conductivity to minimise Joule heating.
●Considerable Seebeck coefficient to maximise the conversion of heat to electrical
power or electrical power to cooling performance.
●Low thermal conductivity to avoid thermal conduction across the material.
And these three properties are best represented as a single metric that quanti-
fies the total performance of the thermoelectric unit by a ‘thermoelectric figure of
merit’ or ‘Z’. Now as ‘Z’ has a unit of temperature per degree, it is better to use, as
a more practical dimensionless figure of merit, z⋅T, where T is the average working

2.6 Direct Electrical Conversion Device
113
temperature. This is a critical parameter which describes the magnitude of any TE
devices’ maximum power conversion efficiency [93].
In which case, the figure of merit can be calculated from Eq. (2.14) [94]:
zT = S2𝜎T
Ktotal
(2.14)
In this equation, S represents the Seebeck coefficient, 𝜎is the electrical conduc-
tivity, T is the average temperature, and Ktotal is the total conductivity and is the
summation of Kl and Ke which are the thermal conductivities due to the lattice and
due to the electrons, respectively.
The figure of merit is dimensionless and in order for TEGs to have a high efficiency,
the value of zT needs also to be high and in this respect, the quantity (S2𝜎– in the
numerator) and known as the power factor (PF) is a key element for maximising the
figure of merit zT.
2.6.8
Fermi Level
The PF is used as a measure of thermoelectric efficiency, the electrical conductivity
being comparative to the density of the carrier and the Seebeck coefficient being
inversely proportional to this. Hence optimisation of the Fermi transition rates is
very important for optimising thermoelectric efficiency. B. Ohtani [95] describes the
Fermi level in the form of the quantity of energy of electric equilibrium for a solid
substance. Additionally, the Fermi energy is assumed to be the energy of the most
energetic electron at absolute zero temperature (T = 0 K). The PF, and thus the merit
figure, both highly depend on the Fermi-level location, the PF being balanced when
the Fermi level is located near the bottom of the conductive band.
To explain, atoms, in their simplest terms, consist of a central nucleus surrounded
by a cloud of fast-moving electrons – the number of which depending upon the ele-
ment, hydrogen (the lightest element) having 1 electron, helium 2, lithium 3, barium
4, and so forth right up to elements like uranium with 92 electrons and other even
large atoms. In free space these electrons each have clear energy levels – grouped into
shells – the lowest energy levels or shells (those closest to the nucleus) filling first
whilst the outer shells may or may not be completely filled again depending upon
the element, and which with uranium for example, has an shell structure (electrons
per shell) of 2 : 8 : 18 : 32 : 21 : 9 : 2. The highest or outer shell is termed the valance
shell and it is those electrons that make up most chemical bonds and chemical reac-
tions. However, when atoms are arranged in a solid they are in close proximity with
each other and these energy levels interact and effect each other so that they appear
more like a continuous energy band rather than as discrete separate energy levels.
This also means that the valence shell or bands interact to form a new hybrid shell
the conduction band representing a band of possible but vacant electron states, and
which, in semiconductors is separated from the valance band by a band gap. Now
in solids the ability of an electron to act as a charge carrier depends on the availabil-
ity of vacant states i.e. its ability to move from the valance to the conduction band.
The Fermi level therefore represents the energy level of the highest occupied band

114
2 Waste Heat Recovery
and typically sits between the valency shell or band and the slightly more energetic
conduction band.
Therefore, if the PF plotted against the Fermi level, the highest values appear when
the Fermi level is located close to the bottom of the conduction band, the differences
in position (either slightly above or below the bottom) being attributed to the varying
dependency of the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient on the Fermi
level.
To get a good-high PF requires doping the semiconductor (adding impurities to
the pure semiconductor atoms), so that the Fermi level can be changed to optimise
the PF. In addition, since high conductivity at low Fermi energy is also required, this
implies that there should be many free channels in the conductive band so that there
is little need to move the Fermi level to within the conductive band which would then
reduce the Seebeck coefficient [96]. In other words, all energy states lower than Ef
are filled and all states beyond Ef are vacant at T = 0 K.
Now as noted earlier, in insulators and semiconductors, the Fermi level lies in the
energy gap between the valence and the conduction bands, the exact position of Ef
which is given by the Fermi distribution function as shown in Eq. (2.15) [97].
f(E) =
1
1 + exp
( E−Ef
kT
)
(2.15)
where, Ef is energy such that the Fermi distribution function f(E) accurately deter-
mines the distribution of electrons between the usable states in the valence and
conduction bands, E is the electronic charge, k is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the
average absolute (Kelvin) temperature of the sample, and Ef is expected to occur in
the middle of the energy gap for intrinsic semiconductors (the pure form of the semi-
conductor) – indicating an equal probability of electrons in the conductive band and
holes in the valence band at a given temperature [98].
Nevertheless, in extrinsic semiconductors (a semiconductor in which impurities
are purposely introduced to make it conductive), Ef occurs (at low temperatures)
either inside the conduction band (n-type) or within the valence band (p-type)
depending on the sign and concentration of the majority carriers and the absolute
temperature.
2.6.9
Nano-Sizing
Owing to the fundamental strong link between electrical conductivity and thermal
conductivity in most materials, strong zT values have been difficult to achieve. So
achieving high electrical conductivity to decrease the TE unit’s temperature resis-
tance (Joule), but ensuring low thermal conductivity in order to preserve a consistent
differential in temperature between the hot and the cold side has been challenging
[99].
However, another approach to raising the figure of merit is by reducing the overall
thermal conductivity (Ktotal). In order to achieve this, researchers have succeeded

2.6 Direct Electrical Conversion Device
115
in artificially structuring materials on a nano scale and so designing the lattice’s
thermal conductivity and lowering it from the value it would usually have in bulk
materials. This is accomplished by introducing a wide number of grain boundaries
and other dispersion centres that essentially disperse phonons but are inefficient in
electron scattering. Essentially, it is an attempt to greatly reduce the lattice’s thermal
conductivity whilst not drastically impacting its electrical conductivity, and this has
recently prove to be quite fruitful [100].
Initially, there was a steady progress until around 1970, when figure of merit of
1 was reached, then there was a period where there was practically no change. But
once the idea of utilising nanotechnology to advance thermoelectric performance
was introduced and enforced, the figure of merit values increased significantly. This
is because the thermal conductivity of the lattice could then be designed to lower
values [101].
2.6.10
Efﬁciency of TEG
The efficiency of a TEG can be expressed as the ratio of the produced electrical energy
(Welec) to the thermal energy entering the hot face (Qh), and which for a TEM using
a generator can be deduced from Eq. (2.16) for optimal electrical charge [97].

(2.16)
where zT is usually calculated at the mean temperature of the hot side temperature
(TH) and the cold side temperature (Tc). It should be evident from the equation that
an increase in zT will lead to a boost in energy conversion efficiency.
Moreover, the maximum power generated by the TEG can also be predicted via
Eq. (2.17) [98]
Pmax (W) = ΔT

(2.17)
where ̇Q represents the rate of heat transfer through the TEG (W) and may be defined
as the ratio of the temperature difference to the TEG thermal resistance (RTEG ∘C/w)
as shown in Eq. (2.18) [102]:
̇Q(W) = ΔT
RTEG
(2.18)
A TEG can therefore produce its maximum power when it operates at half the
open circuit voltage and at half the short circuit current, in which case an alternative
means of measuring a TEG’s potential strength may be written as Eq. (2.19) [98]:
P = VI →Pmax = 1

Thermal Storage
The policy position of the European Union (EU) is to shift forward into a low-carbon
economy with a cut of at least 40% in domestic-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions before 2030 and investigations have shown that a vast majority of GHG
emissions are related to the production of energy. As an example, and as explained
by European Association for Storage of Energy (EASE) [103], more than half of
the energy consumption in the EU comes from the cooling and heating of the
buildings. Additionally, a large amount of energy is wasted by devices which,
although implemented for the production and utilisation of energy applications,
are not used efficiently [104]. Accordingly, the use of energy storage systems has
been identified as one of the most important areas of research and development to
improve the energy efficiency of industrial and domestic appliances and for helping
to achieve the goals which are defined in the EU 2020 targets and the European
Commission (EC) Energy Roadmap 2050 [105].
As the name implies, thermal energy storage works by adjusting the state of a
storage system in terms of heating or cooling its TES medium. The use of TES for
domestic and industrial processes allows for the accumulation of energy from pro-
cesses such as WHR and power generation, to then be used, at a later stage, for
heating or cooling, and the like. Moreover, utilising TES within a system allows for
better balancing between the supply and demand of energy [106], so reducing run-
ning costs and the time for any ROI [107]. In addition, combing and integrating TES
with renewable energy systems such as solar and power to heat can provide a suitable
approach for low-carbon energy harvesting and usage [108].
As explained by Koohi and Rosen [109], energy storage systems can be split into
different categories, namely, thermal, thermochemical, magnetic, hydro, flywheel,
hydrogen, compressed air, and liquefied air energy storage systems. As can be seen
from Figure 2.26, each system is also divided into further classifications, each of
which use a different medium to store energy.
Figure 2.27 illustrates an overview of different thermal energy storage methods
which, as can be seen, classifies thermal energy storage into chemical and physical
processes, the later by sensible and latent heat [109–114]
When selecting and designing a TES system, several important parameters such
as energy storage density, mechanical strength, chemical stability, and cyclability
properties need to be considered, but having indicated that, thermal conductivity of
the TES system has also been shown to be an important factor since this indicates
the dynamics of change between charging and discharging. As indicated by Baden-
horst [115], a low thermal conductivity means a rapid reduction in energy storage
and generation. Moreover, other criterions such as duty cycle, peak load, operating
temperature, and ease of system integration have also been indicated as key factors
when designing a TES system.
Table 2.10 indicates the selection of different parameters in terms of different
requirements and reasons for TES systems [110, 116].

Sensible Heat Storage
Sensible heat is described as the most common and feasible approach to TES [110,
114]. Sensible heat is described as the heat that is transformed to change the tem-
perature of a storage medium without changing its phase. Figure 2.28 shows the
linear relationship between the temperature and stored heat of a storage medium
based on sensible heat. Sensible heat storage therefore only offers low energy density

between final temperature (Tf ) and initial temperature (Ti) (∘C).
Water, oil, and ceramics are the most widely used sensible heat storage medi-
ums and are employed in both domestic and industrial settings, for example, as
hot water storage for district heating or energy storage within a building envelope
[111]. Other sensible thermal energy storage methods include the use of geother-
mal energy through a borehole, an aquifer, a cavern, ducts in the soil, pit hot water
storage (hydro-accumulation), and rock-filled storage (rock, pebble, gravel) [109].
2.7.2
Latent Heat Storage
Latent heat storage systems on the other hand, take advantage of a phase change
phenomenon in a specific temperature range for the storage medium to absorb and
later transfer heat. The most commonly used materials for latent heat storage being
water, ice, paraffin wax, and molten salt [111]. These TES systems can be split into
two main types – direct and indirect heat transfer methods [108]. The direct tech-
nique includes the transfer of heat between a heat transfer fluid and the latent heat
storage material, whereas the indirect method comprises a solid heat transfer border
between the two.
Phase change of a medium occurs through evaporation, condensation, crystallisa-
tion, or meting, all processes without affecting the aggregation state of the solid or
liquid phase. This process therefore enables the storage of a large quantity of thermal
energy based on the properties of the employed material. As indicated by Mehling
and Cabeza [110], a very slight change of volume of less than 10% occurs with no
change in pressure when the storage medium experiences a temperature change.
This means that the phase change between liquid and solid state of the storage mate-
rial occurs within a constant temperature. Hence, once the material has undergone
a phase change, its temperature is kept within a constant range, which is also known
as the phase change temperature, but once this phase change is completed and with
a further transfer of heat, the heat storage turns back into sensible heat phase as
shown in Figure 2.29.

The latent stored heat has been shown to be equal to the enthalpy change that
occurs between the two states, for example between solid and liquid phase as shown
by Eq. (2.21).
ΔQ = ΔH = mΔh
(2.21)
When the phase transition temperature is reached, the molecular structure within
the phase change material (PCM) changes from solid to liquid form. The phase tran-
sition temperature is dictated by several factors such as the rate of cooling and the
amount of particle impurities within the PCM, but in general, PCMs that go through
solid to solid phase change are known to offer higher storage capacity whilst having
smaller volume change. This also means that there will be no leakages from the PCM
and hence no material encapsulation will be required. These beneficial properties
therefore make use of this type of PCM more likely than say solid to liquid PCMs
[106]. However, that being said, the energy density in liquid storage systems can be
higher than that of a solid storage system, since a phenomena in relation to chemical
bond transformation within the material structure during phase change can occur
[111]. In which case the latent thermal capacity of a material can be demonstrated
to be [114]:
Q = m CpdT(s) + mL + mCpDT
(2.22)
where m represents the mass of PCM in kg, dT is the temperature change, and L is
the fusion enthalpy. The equation therefore demonstrates the correlation between
the available heat within the PCM at the solid phase, the liquid phase with additional
sensible heat and the fusion latent heat.
The most popular PCMs used for WHR, buildings, and solar systems are mainly
based on fatty acids, hydrochloric hydrates, and paraffin waxes [117]. When design-
ing a latent heat TES system, several factors such as geometric and operational

122
2 Waste Heat Recovery
parameters as well as exergy and energy performance need to be carefully consid-
ered. These parameters can include the working fluid mass flow rate, PCM number,
and specific properties such as melting temperature, types, and amounts of additives
to the PCM, heat exchange surface dimensions, and reference temperatures related
to heating and cooling of the PCM.
As Prasad et al. [118] explain, the amount of thermal energy through charging and
discharging processes can be determined from the following correlations.
Charging process:
𝜂charging =
∫̇Qstoreddt
∫̇Qsupplieddt
= Qstored
Qsupplied
(2.23)
Discharging process:
𝜂charging =
∫̇Quseddt
∫̇Qstoreddt
= Qused
Qstored
(2.24)
Overall process:
𝜂charging =
∫̇Quseddt
∫̇Qsupplieddt
=
Qused
Qsupplied
(2.25)
The energy performance of the heat storage can be evaluated through the ratio of
the total energy over the maximum energy stored in the system and by:
Ratioheatstorage =
∫̇Qstoreddt
Qmaximum
=
Qstored
Qmaximum
(2.26)
On the other hand, the performance of energy release by the system can be derived
through the ratio of the total amount of released heat over the maximum energy in
the system:
Ratioheatstorage =
∫̇Qreleaseddt
Qmaximum
= Qreleased
Qmaximum
(2.27)
We should however note that energy performance analysis only indicates the
quantity of energy transmitted during the charging and discharging processes,
rather than the quality of the transmitted energy, but energy quality during charging
and discharging can also be indicated through exergy analyses and this way the
design of a TES system can be optimised.
Charging process:
𝜓charging =
∫̇Exstoreddt
∫̇Exsupplieddt
= Exstored

(2.28)
Discharging process:

The exergy efficiency can then be determined through the number of entropy gen-
eration following Eq. (2.30).
𝜓= 1 −Ns
(2.31)
2.7.3
Thermochemical Storage
Thermochemical energy storage (TCES) involves a fully reversible chemical reaction
and allows for a higher energy density, operating temperature, and greater exergy
efficiency to be achieved compared to other types of TES systems. The thermochemi-
cal process includes restructuring of the molecular chemical bonds during the charg-
ing and discharging processes which, in turn, increases the energy capacity [119,
120]. As you might expect, selection of the thermochemical material is a key fac-
tor when developing a TCES system, and TCES materials needs to be economical,
abundant, stable, cyclical, fast and highly kinetically reactive, highly conductive, and
non-toxic with no side reaction [118]. The thermochemical reaction itself needs to be
a reversible process in which two substances are involved in a chain chemical reac-
tion once the necessary quantity of thermal energy is applied. One problem however,
is that over time, the efficiency of the chemical reaction becomes slower which can
result in lower energy capacity.
AB + Q ↔A + B
(2.32)
Research into the effectiveness of different TCES storage systems has been carried
out through experimental analyses on gas-to-gas, solid-to-gas, and sulfuric-based
thermoelectric energy storage systems for high-temperature applications at or above
300 ∘C [118]. The effect of air pollution on the use of TCES for buildings were inves-
tigated and ageing tests were performed to investigate the usability of the storage
material for long-term application and usage. Furthermore, absorption tests were
performed under several dynamic and static conditions and for different pollutants.
Finally, analyses was carried out to indicate how different environmental conditions
affect any loss in heat storage capacity.
Figure 2.30 represents different applications of solid, liquid, and thermochem-
ical storage systems, and shows the various technologies being used to provide
high-energy efficiencies grouped by the method of energy storage.
2.7.4
Phase Change Materials
PCMs are considered to be an ideal choice for TES systems because of their ability to
absorb, accumulate, and then release large amount of thermal energy from a small
unit of mass [120]. They are used in numerous applications [112] and have proved
to be a viable solution for WHR, solar system applications, and energy savings in
building applications [120].
PCMs are mainly used in latent heat TES systems because they are able to help
eliminate the gaps between system demand and energy supply – their specific char-
acteristics offering enhanced energy performance together with a means to achieve

efficient and effective improvements in the conservation of system energy [119]. The
advantages of using PCMs, and their attraction for use within latent heat TES sys-
tems include their ability to supply thermal energy at an almost constant uniform
temperature, their high-energy density for comparatively low material volumes and
weights [119], and their lower cost.
Research has shown that the melting enthalpy and the melting temperature
or melting point of the material are the main parameters that determine the

2.7 Thermal Storage
125
performance of a PCM-based TES system [110, 121]. So, in simple terms, when
selecting a PCM-based system, the melting point of the material needs to be higher
than the maximum ambient temperature and lower than the temperature supplied
by the heat source.
However, in view of the previously noted key parameters, selecting an appropri-
ate TES PCM can be a challenging task and so requires special consideration, and
an ideal PCM should meet certain parameters and contain the characteristics listed
below [110–122]
●The phase transition temperature must satisfy the TES application
●Contain a high storage capacity and offer a high melting enthalpy
●Possess good thermal conductivity to ensure a high rate of charging and discharg-
ing
●Present adequate chemical and thermal properties to provide robust storage
capacity
●Be safe, non-toxic, non-flammable or non-explosive and environmentally friendly
●Be easily integrated with other construction materials or components
●Offer minimal volume change between phase transitions and contain a well-
balanced rate of crystallisation
●Produce low vapour pressure and be completely reversible during each cycle of
storage
●Offer good recyclability, low cost, and be available and abundant.
It should therefore not be surprising, considering this extensive and sometimes
conflicting list, that until now there are no PCMs that can fully meet all these param-
eters [111, 121]. Each available PCM offers certain pros and cons so that each mate-
rial must be individually considered for a specific TES application.
To assist with this choice, PCMs are classified into different categories based on
their characteristics of phase transition, chemical nature, and temperature range.
Widely used PCMs are mainly paraffin or organic non-paraffin based and include,
fatty acids, alcohols, polymers, and glycols but they can also comprise a combina-
tion of organic–organic, inorganic–inorganic, or organic–inorganic materials. Again
these can also be classified by their properties of phase transition change and then in
terms of their solid–liquid, solid–solid, and solid–gas criteria [111]. Moreover, since
each PCM can be utilised for different applications, they can also be classified by
particular shape stabilisation properties. Figure 2.31 shows different classifications
for latent TES mediums [120, 121, 123] (Table 2.11).
2.7.5
Organic Material
In general, organic PCMs can be split into three different groups: fatty acids, paraf-
fins, and organic mixtures, but organic-based PCMs offer several advantages that
makes them more favourable than inorganic substances. For example, they have
greater chemical/thermal stability, are easily recycled, are non-corrosive and offer
larger latent heat of fusion values. That being said, they do have some disadvantages
(compared to inorganic materials) and these include: being prone to flammability,

offering lower enthalpy, having lower thermal conductivity, and presenting less com-
patibility with encapsulation [111].
Paraffin for instance has been used as the ideal choice of organic PCM and has
been applied to many thermal energy storage systems [121, 124], the main reason
being that the material offers high fusion heat, has a low vapour pressure, allows
constant conductivity cyclic stability, and is chemically inert without being toxic
or corrosive. In fact, paraffin has been found as an optimal PCM for energy saving
within buildings by improving the energy performance of double-glazed windows
[125]. Conversely, the material still has certain limitations such as a low thermal
conductivity and high volume increase during phase change [123, 124].
Fatty acids or as called non-paraffin PCMs are another popular organic mate-
rial which are constructed from animal or plant fat. This type of PCM is entirely
organically based and offers enhanced physical and thermal properties compared to
paraffin. To offset this, the material does require specific encapsulation techniques
for its application since it is prone to leakage. Figure 2.32 illustrated the advantages
and disadvantages of different organic PCMs.

2.7.6
Inorganic PCMs
Inorganic PCMs are another ideal option for storing and releasing large amounts
of latent heat, their success being achieved by a combination of specific techniques
employed to allow storage in different molecular transformations. The techniques
include transformation of the material through crystallographic, amorphous, and
crystal structures, and order–disorder and magnetic field changes. Compared to
organic PCMs, employing inorganic materials is often more cost-effective, offers
higher phase change enthalpy, and better conduction of thermal energy. Despite
these, certain disadvantages do exist such as being corrosive, having potential
phase boundary separation, and offering instable thermal output limits, the conse-
quences of which mean that the use of these materials has been mainly restricted to
high-temperature WHR from industrial plants [106, 111]. Another source of popular
inorganic PCMs has been metallic foams. These offer high thermal conductivity
whilst maintaining good stability, high coefficient ratios, and low density [126].
2.7.7
Eutectic PCMs
Inorganic eutectic PCMs are a mixture of two (or more) different types of PCMs and
are available in organic–organic, organic–inorganic, or inorganic–inorganic combi-
nations. For example, the following are illustrations of the different material com-
positions that can be used as an eutectic mixture:
●Organic–organic: Myristic-stearic, Lauric palmitic, Capric-laurie
●Organic–inorganic: Salt-based BACl2-KCl-NaCl, MgKCl2-KCl, LiOH-KOH
●Inorganic–inorganic: Urea NH4Br, naphthalene benzoic acid
One advantage of a eutectic material is its rapid transformation ability, both in
its changes to the liquid phase during heat absorption and also changing back into a
crystal mixture during the freezing stage. This is why mixtures such as water–salt are
such a viable solution for dealing with energy storage at sub-zero temperatures [110].
Alternatively, organometallic, solid–solid PCMs are another type of eutectic PCMs
which are structured from different layers of organic and inorganic materials into a
sandwich-like crystalline format [106]. These materials then offer a unique method
of energy storage since heat absorption is achieved only through the organic or soft
segment of the material which are made of alkyl chains. The inorganic section of
the PCM remain thermally inert and mainly stays structurally intact. During energy
absorption, the alkyl chains experience a transition from solid phase or crystalline
form into liquid or amorphous form in a disordered state, and this particular prop-
erty enables the solid–solid organometallic PCMs to be stable and fully reversible
with minimal volume change during the transition even at relatively at high tem-
peratures.

2.7 Thermal Storage

2.7.8
PCM Methodologies
2.7.8.1
Encapsulation of PCMs
Encapsulation is a technique that enhances the functionality of PCM-based TES
systems by helping to eliminate risks associated with leakage or the interaction
of the active element of a material with the outside environment. It also helps
eliminate issues associated with phase separation and increases lifespan [111, 127].
Encapsulation is therefore an effective way of increasing both the efficiency and
the performance of PCM-based TES systems. For example, by encapsulating PCM
and modifying the configuration of the system and by adding finned tubes, both
the heat transfer and the heat absorption can be increased. Regrettably though,
encapsulation can also allow the introduction of relative impurities, such as nano
particles to the active substance of the PCM – which in turn, may subsequently
increase the thermal conductivity of the material. Notwithstanding all of this, we
should note that in most applications, except for a few materials such as ice PCMs
need to be encapsulated to avoid leakage – particularly in their liquid phase, and
this is an important factor towards protecting the environment [110].
There are several encapsulation techniques, and each can be categorised by their
relative applications, advantages, and disadvantages [128]. Further, the encapsula-
tion methods can also be grouped into nano, macro, and micro categories and each of
these can include different methods of production [110, 123, 124]. Figure 2.33 shows
advantages and disadvantages of each encapsulation technique applications [120].
2.7.8.2
Microencapsulated PCMs
Microencapsulation is a process by which individual particles of an active agent are
stored within a shell, surrounded or coated with a continuous film of polymeric
material to produce particles in the micrometre to millimetre range, and its use can
increase the heat transfer rate of PCMs by enhancing their surface area to volume
ratio. The method allows continuous matrices of the materials to be produced so
making them suitable for use in building applications of passive cooling, heating,
and energy-saving purposes. Microencapsulation can be developed through either
physical or chemical means and can be used for several applications such as
heat transfer fluids, heat insulation materials, phase change slurry, and textiles
[129, 130]. Equation (2.33) indicates the potential energy saving within a building
when PCM TES for cooling and heating is used. In addition, Eq. (2.34) also shows the
percentage improvement in peak heat flux reduction when the same technique is
employed [114].

Microencapsulation as a technique involve the closure of unstable, sensitive
solid or liquid particles with diameters between 1 and 1000 μm with a solid layer
[110, 131] to form solid particles. This protects the energy storage material so
preventing long-term degradation and evaporation processes and ensuring better
solubility [120]. Research has shown that the newly formed microstructure of the
material delivers better heat transfer and solubility.
The following techniques can be employed to develop microencapsulation:
●Chemical: mini-emulsion polymerisation, suspension polymerisation;
●Physicochemical: ionic gelation, coacervation;
●Physico-mechanical: vibrational nozzle, centrifugal extrusion, solvent evapora-
tion, and spray drying.
Figure 2.34 indicates different shapes of microstructures that can be coated using

tions [132].

Beneﬁts of microencapsulation of PCMs. Source: Based on Rathore et al. [114].
Figure 2.35 illustrates the advantages of microencapsulation and of using a shell
material to encapsulate PCMs [114].
However, in addition to these benefits, microencapsulation can also be used to
enhance the TES capacity of an organic PCM by using an inorganic substance as
the shell material. Generally, the thermal conductivities of organic PCMs are lower
than those of inorganic materials but by combining these through encapsulation of
the overall heat transfer of the substance can be improved. Further increases in the
thermal conductivity of the shell is also possible by the addition of carbon-based
materials. Conversely and notwithstanding these benefits, applying microencapsu-
lation can however also reduce a material’s capacity for latent heat absorption. This
is mainly because by introducing a shell to the PCM, its microstructure proportion,
and subsequently its energy storage operating point can become uniform and so
limited [132].
Huang et al. [132] concluded that suspension polymerisation and coacervation
are suitable for the preparation of large particle MPCMs with high core content and
concluded that:
●The spray drying method has the advantages of being both economical and easy to
scale-up to produce microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs), how-
ever, it can also produce uneven results.

132
2 Waste Heat Recovery
●The sol–gel method is suitable for the synthesis of inorganic shells.
●The process of interfacial polymerisation is simple, the reaction rate is fast, and
the encapsulation efficiency is high, but the activity requirement for the reactive
monomer is also relatively high (Table 2.12).
2.7.8.3
Macroencapsulation of the PCMs
Macroencapsulation is a process in which the PCM is encapsulated within a shell
substance to form larger containers than microencapsulation (5 mm [133], 1 mm
[134]). The shape and geometry of the encapsulating shell can be in the form of
cubes, pouches, cylinders, tubes, or any other configuration, and so is ideal for incor-
poration into building envelope materials in different forms, sizes, and shapes. The
actual structure and physical configuration of microencapsulation being different
for different TES devices as shown in Figure 2.36 [119].
2.7.8.4
Nanomaterial PCMs
Mahdi et al. [127] demonstrated that PCM thermal transfer improvements can be
made either by specifically inserting solid high thermal conductivity components
such as metallic fins, foam, and heat pipes in the material; or indirectly by enhancing
the heat transfer-physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, real heat, and
latent heat of the PCM itself using micro- and nano-additives. These additives can
be in the form of carbon nanotubes, metal nanoparticles, or carbon nanofibers where
particle dimensions (for nanomaterials) range from 1 to 1000 nm [134] and, as noted
subsequently, their production methodology uses either a top-down or a bottom-up
technique [120]:
Top-Down Technique: This approach involves the use of specific method to decon-
struct and so reduce the size and shape of larger materials to that required by
the particular nanomaterial application. The methods used for this technique are
namely emulsification and emulsification solvent evaporation.
Bottom-Up Technique: In this method, materials are formed from basic building
blocks by the self-assembly of molecules determined by elements such as
concentration, ion properties, temperature, and pH. Techniques used are namely
such as coacervation and nanoprecipitation but integration complexity are also
part of this strategy.
Nanoparticle Diffusion: (also known as nano-PCM) Nanoparticle diffusion is
another process that can increase the thermal conductivity of PCMs [128]. For
example [124], paraffin mixed with a type of nano-SiC (silicon-carbide) led to the
increase of thermal conductivity for a photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) panel, but
other articles [126] also discuss the practicality of using other highly thermally
conductive nanoparticles and draw upon studies around materials such as
carbon-based fibres and nanotubes, aluminium and silver nanoparticles, and
porous metallic foams.
For example with carbon materials, there are several techniques to obtaining
the required characteristics of particle size, pore size distribution, and surface

particles with a thickness of 10–100 nm, known as graphite nano-platelets (GNPs)
or exfoliated graphite. As shown in Figure 2.37, the graphene (a single layer of
atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice) is classified as a pure
graphite layer, and is derived from breaking a graphite crystal until a single layer
of this element form is created [115]. A nanotube, in simple terms, is made of
graphene sheet rolled into a cylindrical shape with edges knitted together, whereas
a fullerene is produced by mating graphene segments to each other into a spherical
shape – these forms each displaying unique characteristics differ from graphite,
even though they have the same atomic configuration.

Shape Stabilisation
Shape stabilisation is also important to avoid leakages and to improve the energy
storage ability of PCMs [121, 122, 124, 132] and form-stabilised or shape-stabilised
PCM (SSPCM) consists of a working material with a supporting component. The
working material absorbs or removes latent heat during the melting or solidifying
cycle, whilst the supporting substance stops the melting process from leaking mate-
rial so that the entire system stays in a constrained state [122]. A variety of materials
are used to stabilise the various forms of PCMs which include porous materials,
nanomaterials, and polymers, and an outline of the supporting materials is shown in
Figure 2.38. It should however be noted that the addition of any supporting material
eventually results in a reduction of energy storage density [135].

Introduction
The design of a WHR system relies on heat transfer fundamentals i.e. heat recovery
technologies – such as HEXs, boilers, condensers, burners, heat pumps, and oth-
ers – all primarily designed and sized using heat transfer theory. And even though
multiple tools and software packages have been developed to make the design pro-
cess easier and more user-friendly, it, nonetheless, remains crucial to understand
the thermodynamic processes involved. Now when analysing any WHR system, two
steps are usually considered. Firstly the variables that may affect the heat trans-
fer need to be identified and reasonable assumptions need to be made about the

136
2 Waste Heat Recovery
importance of these variables to the process. Then, the appropriate physical laws
are considered and those thought relevant are used to describe and predict the heat
transfer mechanisms taking place within the WHR system. The most difficult part
therefore in designing and predicting the performance of a system in understanding
the physics and identifying the implied phenomena. Experience has shown that a
significant number of errors made in the predictions or the design are due to the
omitted assumptions regarding unexpected heat or mass transfer mechanisms dur-
ing any process. Therefore, great attention must be paid during the selection of all the
relevant heat transfer laws and their implications during the thermal design stages.
Only then, once the heat transfer phenomena involved during the WHR process
have been carefully identified can the fundamental laws of heat transfer can be used
to size the installation. Accordingly, the basics of heat transfer fundamentals must be
known and several main principles are covered in the following material. To begin
with, the first law of thermodynamics (also known as the conservation of energy)
stipulates that the change of internal energy (ΔEsystem) for a system equals the total
energy entering the system (Ein) minus the total energy leaving the system (Eout),
expressed in the form of the equation:
ΔEsystem = Ein −Eout
(2.35)
where E is the energy in Joules (J).
However, we also need to note that during any transient behaviour periods for a
system (such as the start-up), the variation of internal energy of the system is not
zero. Whilst contrastingly, during steady-state operating conditions the energy leav-
ing the system is equal to the energy entering the system and so there is no variation
in internal energy.
Now energy provided by, or given to the system can be transmitted through two
media: heat transfer and work. In the case where no work is provided and the energy
variation is only due to heat transfer, the first law of dynamics is adapted to a heat
balance equation given as:
ΔEsystem = Qin −Qout + Egenerated
(2.36)
where Q is the net amount of heat transfer (J) and Egenerated is the internal heat gen-
eration for the system (J). For steady heat flow cases, such as water being heated in
a pan, the energy given to the system during the heating of a constant mass without
phase change is:
Q = msystemcpΔT
(2.37)
where Q is the thermal energy provided to the constant mass system during the heat-
ing (J), msystem is the mass of the system (kg), cp its specific heat (J/kg K), and ΔT
the difference in temperature before and after the heating occurs (K). To illustrate
heat transfer, the concept of a thermal resistance is used, and by electrical anal-
ogy, the thermal resistance is the difference of a potential (or driving force) divided
by the energy flux going through this resistance. The electrical–thermal analogy is
described in Table 2.13.

This relationship between the thermal resistance, the heat transfer rate, and the
system difference in temperature is called Newton’s law of cooling, and to estimate
the thermal resistance this fundamental law is often arranged in terms of a heat
transfer coefficient (h) as:
̇Q = ΔT
R = hAΔT
(2.38)
where ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W), h the heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), and A
the heat transfer area (m2). Newton’s law of cooling is very commonly used in ther-
mal design as it gives a general relationship that can then be adapted according to the
heat transfer mode taking place. The different heat transfer modes are usually clas-
sified by three mechanisms: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is
the transfer of energy without material displacement and is typically taking place in
solids where the molecules are fixed. The conductive transfer of energy is expressed
by the Fourier’s law in three dimensions as:
⃗̇Qconduction = −kA⃗∇T = −kA
(
𝜕T
𝜕x
⃗i + 𝜕T
𝜕y
⃗j + 𝜕T
𝜕z
⃗k
)
(2.39)
where ̇Qconduction is the conduction heat transfer rate (W), k is the thermal conduc-
tivity of the material (W/m K), A is the heat transfer area (m2), and T is the temper-
ature (K). If the conduction heat transfer is taking place in one direction only, then
Fourier’s law can be reduced to:
̇Qconduction = −kAdT
dx
(2.40)
which means that the temperature variation in the material is linear on the x-axis.
In contrast to conduction, convection describes heat transfer with molecular move-
ment or displacement, e.g. where heat transfer occurs between a solid material and
an adjacent liquid or gas that is in motion.
Convective heat transfer uses Newton’s law of cooling (given in Eq. (2.38)) to
describe the temperature profile for the heat transfer rate in the system, the heat
transfer area, and the convective heat transfer coefficients, and to estimate the
convective heat transfer coefficient, numerous correlations are available and depend
on the type of convection taking place.

138
2 Waste Heat Recovery
Firstly, convection is divided into two actions – (i) natural convection and (ii)
forced convection. In natural convection, fluid motion occurs naturally due to some
physical phenomena such as density gradients (differences in density) or buoyancy;
and the heat transfer coefficients for natural convection are generally lower than
those for forced convection. In forced convection the fluid motion is forced by an
external mean, such as a pump. Forced convection itself is also further divided in
two domains. For flows where the fluid surrounds a solid material, such as an air
stream flowing around a vertical heated pipe, the forced convection is called ‘exter-
nal forced convection’. Alternatively, when the fluid in motion is itself surrounded
by a solid material, the forced convection is designated as ‘internal forced convec-
tion’. For instance, water flowing inside a heated pipe is a case of internal convection.
For these three identified types of convection, namely natural convection, internal
forced convection, and external forced convection, correlations to estimate the heat
transfer coefficient are strongly dependent on the fluid velocity and the fluid regime.
For low velocities, the fluid tends to flow without lateral mixing, i.e. there are no
cross-currents perpendicular to the direction of flow, nor eddies nor swirls of fluid.
Hence the motion of the fluid molecules is very orderly, moving in straight lines
or layer which do not mix and remain in the same relative position. This is the
most stable state for a moving fluid without turbulence and is described as ‘laminar
flow’. However, at high velocities, the fluid experiences the onset of a more chaotic
flow patterns, creating turbulences which forces the different layers to mix, the flow
becomes less organised and is designated as ‘turbulent flow’. At medium velocities,
the flow transits from laminar to turbulent and the fluid motion becomes more dif-
ficult to describe because changing turbulent disturbances begin to appear and so
the flow switches from laminar to turbulent in an unpredictable way. This regime is
called ‘transitional flow’. To better understand these flow patterns, in 1883 Professor
Osborne Reynold studied these effects and, in honour of his work, we now describe
the governing parameter for the onset of this effect with was a dimensionless con-
stant called the Reynolds number (Re) and defined by:
Re = 𝜌vD
𝜇
(2.41)
where 𝜌is the fluid density (kg/m3), v the mean velocity of water inside the tube
(m/s), D the diameter of the section (m), and 𝜇the fluid dynamic viscosity (Pa s).
It should be noted that the Reynolds number, and thus the turbulences of a flow,
depends on the system geometry and for fluids circulating in a pipe, the smaller the
pipe diameter, the higher the turbulence.
In order to identify which correlations to use with which category, limits have been
set to describe the three turbulence regimes, and the commonly agreed regime limits
are given by [136–138]:
Re < 2300 Laminar flow
2300 ≤Re ≤10 000 Transitional flow
10 000 ≤Re Turbulent flow

2.8 Design Development Methods
139
Convective heat transfer coefficients therefore usually depend on a fluid’s
Reynolds number, but in addition, in forced convection, a further significant
parameter is the friction factor which describes the solid–fluid interaction. This
is because the roughness of a surface strongly affects the fluid dynamics and can
generate fluid turbulences close to the wall. In fact, turbulences actually enhance
the heat transfer by increasing the mixing of the different fluid layers, hence, heat
transfer coefficients are higher for turbulent flows compared to laminar and more
organised flows. However, even if from a heat transfer viewpoint it is tempting to
increase the turbulences of a flow by adapting the geometry, increasing the fluid
velocity, and/or decreasing the flow cross section, a balance must be found with the
increased pressure drop this will also induce. The notion of pressure drop describes
the resistance to the flow created by a fluid’s viscosity and the frictional forces
between that fluid and its solid constraining wall and is also fundamental to the
design of equipment. Indeed, to force a fluid such as air to circulate across HEXs, or
water to flow through pipes, a necessary magnitude of pressure is required to enable
the equipment to succeed in pushing the fluid. So in addition to the size of the
plant, higher pressure drops will require more powerful equipment and so further
increase in energy consumption, all of which will need to be balanced against the
profit made from the heat transfer and the overall performance of the system.
Heat can also be transferred by radiation where energy is conveyed by photons
(explained as an elementary particle by the ideas behind wave-particle duality). So
in WHR, radiation heat transfer can take place from burners due to the presence of
their flames. But in addition, radiation can also take place from any hot surfaces to
other solids and or fluids that are not in direct contact with that surface. For a surface
at a temperature Ts, the maximum heat transfer rate achievable ̇Qradiation,max is given
by the Stefan–Boltzmann law:
̇Qradiation,max = 𝜎sb × AsTs
(2.42)
where 𝜎sb = 5.67 × 10−8 W/m2 K4 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, As the hot sur-
face area (m2), and Ts the surface temperature (K). Then the amount of actual heat
that can be transferred from a hot surface with emissivity 𝜀s at a temperature Th to
a cold surface at temperature Tc and the heat transfer rate is calculated using:
̇Qradiation = 𝜀s𝜎sbAs(Th
4 −Tc
4)
(2.43)
where 𝜀s is the surface emissivity (dimensionless), and Th and Tc are the hot and
cold surface temperatures (K). It should also be noted that the above equation is
only valid if all the radiation from the hot surface is received by the cold surface
and, regrettably, applied radiation heat transfer can become very complex due to the
spreading of radiations between all the surfaces of any system. Hence to pragmati-
cally consider the rate of radiation given from one surface to the other, depending
on their geometry, ‘view’ factors are used.
Sometimes considered as a form of convection, very useful heat transfers can be
achieved by a phase change within a fluid. Indeed, during the phase change pro-
cess for an element, an important amount of energy, called the latent heat, is either
absorbed or released. By reorganising the molecules, elements transiting between

140
2 Waste Heat Recovery
solid, liquid, and gaseous states allow the transport or storage of thermal energy
and for WHR, the main material states used are those occurring between the liquid
and gaseous phases as this transition usually transports a greater amount of energy
compared to solid–liquid changes.
The subsequent subsections will show how these heat transfer fundamentals pro-
vide a foundation for the development of multiple WHR technologies.
2.8.2
Heat Exchangers
To fully appreciate the processes of sizing HEXs, some knowledge regarding the
fundamental laws of conduction and convection are required so as to understand
the necessary heat transfer phenomena. Depending on the type of HEX and the
geometry being considered, different heat transfer mechanisms are employed for
the transfer of thermal energy from the hot fluid to the cold fluid, and in case of the
indirect transfer types of HEX, where the hot and cold fluids are separated by a solid
wall, two methods are commonly used in their design: the log mean temperature
difference (LMTD) method and the effectiveness-number of transfer units (ε-NTU)
method. The LMTD technique is generally used to size a HEX based on the required
fluid temperatures, whereas the ε-NTU technique is better placed to help estimate
the thermal performances of a given HEX. However, before discussing these meth-
ods further, we will first introduce the concept of an overall heat transfer coefficient,
necessary to appreciate their application.
2.8.2.1
Local Heat Transfer
In HEXs, thermal energy is typically transferred from a hot fluid to a cold fluid sep-
arated by a solid material, and for this type of HEX, the heat transfer between the
fluid and the solid wall can occur by either internal forced convection or external
forced convection. With internal forced convection, the fluid flows inside a closed
cavity such as a tube, whilst with external forced convection the contact between
the fluid and the solid material is not confined; for example, hot water flowing over
a bank of solid cylinders is described by external forced convection correlations. The
temperature of the hot fluid Th and the temperature of the cold fluid Tc can be linked
by Newton’s law of cooling:
̇Q =
1
Rtot
(Th −Tc) = UA(Th −Tc)
(2.44)
where ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W), Rtot is the total thermal resistance between
the hot and cold fluids (K/W), Th and Tc are the hot and cold fluid temperatures
respectively (K), U the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), and A the heat
transfer area (m2). To estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient and thus the total
thermal resistance between the hot and cold fluids, a resistance network analogy is
commonly used – the objective of which is to trace the heat flux and identify the
different resistances to the heat flowing between the heat source and the heat sink.
In numerous HEXs, thermal energy is first transferred by the hot fluid to the wall
by forced convection, then transferred by conduction through the solid material,

and finally recovered by the cold fluid through forced convection. But other types of
HEX employ other forms of heat transfer such as radiation, boiling, or condensation,
amongst others. In the simple case of a double-pipe HEX with parallel fluid flows,
the thermal resistance network describing the heat transfer modes are presented in
Figure 2.39.
The total thermal resistance between the hot and cold fluid being given by:
Rtot = ΣR = Rin + Rwall + Rout
(2.45)
Between the inside and the outside of the solid material, thermal energy is trans-
mitted by forced convection where the forced convection thermal resistance Rfc is
given by:
Rfc =
1
hfcAfc
(2.46)
where hfc is the forced convection heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K) and Afc is the
forced convection heat transfer area (m2). However, to estimate the forced convec-
tion heat transfer coefficient, some form of correlation must be used, and such cor-
relations typically consider the fluid properties, the fluid regime, and the solid/fluid
interactions by including the flow Reynolds number (Re) and a friction factor. Simi-
larly, the wall thermal resistance must be evaluated using a suitable equation based
on the geometry. For example, for conduction through a thick-walled tube with an
internal diameter Di and an external diameter Do, the conduction resistance Rcond is
given by:
Rcond = ln(Do∕Di)
2𝜋klL
(2.47)
where kl is the liquid thermal conductivity (W/m K) and L the tube length (m).
Hence in the case of a double-pipe HEX, and taking into account the forced con-
vection resistances for both the inside and outside of the tube, together with the
conduction resistance for the tube wall itself, then the overall heat transfer coeffi-
cient U and the total thermal resistance Rtot can be obtained from:
Rtot =

where Rtot is the total thermal resistance (K/W), U is the overall heat transfer coef-
ficient (W/m2 K), A is the heat transfer area (m2), hfc,in and hfc,out are the forced
convection coefficients for the inside and outside of the inner tube (W/m2 K), and
Afc,in and Afc,out are the respective forced convection heat transfer areas (m2). In other
words, to evaluate the local heat transfer, correlations suitable for forced convection
and the appropriate HEX geometry must be used. But in addition, other geomet-
rical characteristics such as the presence of fins or other phenomena such as the
appearance of fouling can also be added to the thermal resistance network. In par-
ticular, fouling becomes more significant over time due to the accumulation of scale
deposits or occurrence of corrosion on the heat transfer surfaces thereby creating
additional resistances to the flow of heat. In the case of fouling (or scaling), addi-
tional resistance is introduced by adding a fouling factor Rf to represent the thermal
resistance added because of this effect. In which case the total thermal resistance is
now defined from:
Rtot =

(2.49)
where Rf is a fouling factor (m2 K/W). An estimate of the fouling factor depends on
many parameters such as the fluids used, their composition, the extent timeliness,
and practicality of HEX maintenance. But some commonly used values for fouling
factor Rf are noted in Table 2.14.
In the above example analysis, we considered a simple double-pipe HEX to illus-
trate the relationships needed to calculate the overall heat transfer coefficient for
the HEX. However, we also need to note that the overall heat transfer coefficient is
unique for each HEX i.e. it will be based on many factors such as the type of HEX; the
heat transfer process and heat transfer mechanisms; the materials and fluids used;
and the specifics of the studied HEX such as the presence of fins, baffles, and the
like. All of which will influence the calculation of the overall heat transfer coeffi-
cient and to emphasise this variability, Table 2.15 suggests some recommendations
to consider when estimating the overall heat transfer coefficient for a given HEX.

Tubular heat
exchanger
(double-pipe,
shell-and-tube, spiral
tube, pipecoils)
We have already considered above simplest and most
common form of heat exchanger – the simple tubular heat
exchanger, and have noted that the overall heat transfer
coefficient will very much depend upon the geometry, the
arrangement of tubes – in-line or staggered, the flow rate,
the velocity, the density and the viscosity of the fluids, the
friction coefficient between the fluid and the solid wall, etc.
In the case of spiral tubes and helicoidal pipes, the internal
forced convective heat transfer coefficient correlation needs
to be adapted because centrifugal forces induce a second
flow pattern within the tube that enhances the mixing and
so improves the heat transfer. In addition, the conduction
resistance is usually through a pipe thickness and therefore
uses cylindrical geometry. In the earlier analysis, our
estimation of the overall heat transfer coefficient did not
take into account the direction of the flow. This will also
indirectly affect the relationships being used, but we will
considered this later within the sections that cover the log
mean temperature difference (LMTD) method and the
effectiveness-number of transfer units (ε-NTU) method.
Plate heat exchanger
(PHE, spiral,
platecoil, printed
circuit)
In a plate heat exchanger, the fluid circulates between two
plates within a space that is defined by the design of the
plate. The overall resistance model is similar to that for the
tubular heat exchanger as it usually consists of two forced
convection resistances and a conduction resistance through
the thickness of the plate. However, unlike a tubular heat
exchanger, relationships for forced convection and
conduction vary depending on the plate geometry, i.e. the
forced convection correlations can vary according to the
surface aspect of the plates used. For example, it is common
to use corrugated plates to increase the heat transfer and
performances of plate heat exchangers. The use of which
now means that two main aspects that must be considered
in the thermal design process. Firstly any corrugation of the
plate increases its heat transfer area. So an enlargement
factor (𝛷) (which is unique for each type of plate) needs to
be included [139] for estimating the heat transfer area when
using the log mean temperature difference (LMTD) method
or the effectiveness-number of transfer units (ε-NTU)
method. Secondly, each type of corrugation aims at
improving the forced convective heat transfer coefficient, so
again a unique and suitable forced convection heat transfer
coefficient correlation needs to be used for the analysis.

Extended surface heat
exchangers (plate–fin,
tube-fin)
For extended surface heat exchangers, the heat transfer
surface is typically increased by incorporating fins and in all
such cases, the total heat transfer area estimated using either
the LMTD or the ε-NTU method will include the finned
area. Hence by using finned surfaces, a more compact heat
exchanger can be made, of if the size has already been fixed,
it can increase efficiency, but this then implies yet another
adaption to the heat transfer relationships. Now for annular
fins, the forced convection heat transfer coefficient is not
significantly impacted because the fins align with the
direction of the flow. However, in the cases of helical and
spiral finning tubes, fluid motion is changed, fluid mixing
increases which, in turn, increases the forced convection
heat transfer coefficient. So for these cases, the forced
convection correlation needs adapting based on the fins
used and on the geometry of the heat exchanger, and
additionally to complicate things even further, with
plate–fin heat exchangers, the fins are also likely to use
corrugations to further improve their heat transfer rates!
Plate–fin heat exchangers are usually found in compact heat
exchangers in which the fluid flows within channels
between plates. So in such cases, the estimation of the
overall heat transfer coefficient for the heat exchanger also
requires the consideration of the hydraulic diameter for
these small passages. Finally, with extended surface heat
exchangers, the use of fins increases the fouling and again
this need to be taken into account by choosing an ‘adapted’
fouling factor whilst estimating the overall heat transfer
coefficient for the exchanger.
Regenerative heat
exchangers (rotary,
fixed-matrix, rotating
hoods)
In regenerative type heat exchangers, a heat transfer media
is used to store thermal energy and subsequently release it
under different conditions. Usually, heat is recovered by
forced convection from a hot stream to the heat transfer
media and then released according to the same principle.
Yet, for regenerative heat exchangers no steady-state
condition is reached. Instead, transient behaviour must be
studied. Hence to characterise the transient behaviour of the
heat transfer media, transient conduction laws need to be
applied and so once again, depending on the type of heat
transfer media and the geometry of the matrix used, the
forced convection heat transfer coefficient will vary.
Classification according to heat transfer process
Indirect contact heat
exchangers
In indirect contact heat exchangers, the heat source and
heat sink fluids are separated by a solid material and do not
mix, and this is the typical case for most heat exchangers. So
our estimate for the thermal resistance network for the
exchanger must include all the possible heat paths from the
heat source to the heat sink.

Direct contact heat
exchangers
Whereas with direct contact heat exchangers, the heat
source is in direct contact with the heat sink. In which case,
the overall heat transfer coefficient is only that for heat
transfers that are taking place at the interface between the
two materials in contact, say fluid to solid, gas to fluid, or
gas to solid. However, in case of a contact between two
solids, a thermal resistance at the interface is relevant and
should be considered.

Multi-pass heat
exchanger
In multi-pass heat exchangers, one or both of the fluids go
through a number of passes which increases the heat
transfer area and improves the performance, yet, the impact
of these passes is not considered in the estimation of the
overall heat transfer coefficient for the exchanger. Instead,
their impact is considered during the estimation of the heat
transfer area for both the LMTD method and the ε-NTU
method. In particular, when estimating the effectiveness of
the heat exchanger (using the ε-NTU method) separate
correlations for multi-pass heat exchangers exist and must
be used.
Classification according to the Heat transfer mechanisms
Single-phase heat
exchanger
The overall heat transfer coefficient U of the heat exchanger
is estimated normally.
Two-phase heat
exchangers
In two-phase heat exchangers, at least one of the fluids
experiences a phase change during the heat transfer process
showing that heat can also be exchanged by latent heat
transfer. In the case of two-phase heat exchangers, the
correlations to use depend on the fluid motion and
proportion of each phase. Plus, any interactions between
each phase must also be included in the model as it may
impact the heat transfer rate. For instance, in cases where
the liquid vapourises, the location of the vapour and liquid
volume is predominant in the model. At first, vapour
bubbles departing inside the fluid increase the mixing of the

In which case, a thin film of liquid evaporates, and the heat
transfer is significantly higher compared to the heating of a
complete volume of fluid. Overall, pool boiling, flow boiling,
condensation, and forced convective condensation
correlations must be used to estimate the overall heat
transfer coefficient for two-phase heat exchangers.
Condensers
In condensers, as the name suggests, condensation takes
place, but the correlation to use depends mainly on the
presence of a fluid motion or not. For example, if
condensation of a gas takes place within a tube then forced
convective condensation correlations should be used
because those correlations depend on a two-phase flow
regime and proportion of each phase. However, if
condensation of a gas takes place without motion, then
condensation correlations are used. Notwithstanding,
depending on the difference between vapour and wall of
temperatures, two types of condensation can appear:
namely filmwise and dropwise condensation, but in practice
dropwise condensation cannot be maintained and filmwise
condensation then dominates. The reference correlation for
filmwise condensation was determined by Nusselt [140] and
in the estimation of the overall heat transfer coefficient for
condensers, gravity must also be considered. Finally, since
the condensation heat transfer coefficient depends so much
on the vapour and wall temperatures, assumptions and/or
iterations may be necessary to establish a final estimate for
the overall heat transfer coefficient.
Vapourisers
In vapourisers, a fluid transits from a liquid phase to a
gaseous phase and like condensation, the correlations differ
depending on the motion of the fluid. If the fluid vapourises
without motion, pool boiling takes place. Conversely, if
boiling occurs whilst the fluid is in motion, flow boiling
takes place. In other words, for both pool boiling and flow
boiling, the bubble motion influences the heat transfer
coefficient. For pool boiling, the most commonly applied
correlation was developed by Rohsenow [141]. Whereas with
flow boiling, different fluid regimes exist, and each regime is
described by a different correlation. Again, to estimate the
boiling heat transfer coefficient, the liquid and wall
temperatures must be known, and therefore, assumptions or
iterations will be required to estimate the overall heat
transfer coefficient for a vapouriser.

Heat pipe-based heat
exchangers
In heat pipe-based heat exchangers, the heat sources and
heat sinks are separated by heat pipes. On the heat source
side, heat can be transferred from the heat source to the heat
pipe by conduction, convection, radiation, boiling, and
condensation and to estimate this heat transfer coefficient,
the appropriate laws must be used. The conveyed thermal
energy is then transported by the heat pipe from the
evaporator section to the condenser section – these denote
that the heat pipe sections are in contact with the heat
source and heat sink, respectively. The thermal energy is
then released by the heat pipe and recovered by the heat
sink. In addition to the heat source and heat sink heat
transfer thermal resistances, the heat pipe(s) equivalent
thermal resistance must also be estimated, and to do so,
conduction, boiling, and condensation resistances inside the
heat pipe must be determined [138, 142, 143]. Finally, the
equivalent thermal model – considering both heat source
and heat sink thermal resistances, and the heat pipes
equivalent resistance – leads to the estimation of the overall
heat transfer coefficient.
The analysis presented earlier describes the overall heat transfer coefficient for a
HEX, but this approach is not sufficient to fully connect the different inlet and outlet
fluid temperatures and the heat exchange area. So in practice, to design and size of
HEXs and additional methods for describing the HEX processes are employed, all of
which rely on an estimation of the overall heat transfer coefficient for the HEX being
studied. Of these, the two main methods (for sizing a HEX) are the LMTD method
and the ε-NTU method and these are detailed subsequently.
2.8.2.2
LMTD Method
The LMTD method is the first of these commonly used techniques and links the
inlet and outlet temperatures of the fluids to the heat transfer area. Hence, for cases
where the fluid inlet and outlet temperatures are known and/or defined by the user,
the LMTD method can estimate the HEX area needed to achieve the desired perfor-
mance.
According to the first law of dynamics for a system thermally isolated from its
environment, when heat is transferred from a hot fluid to a cold fluid all the heat
lost by the hot fluid is recovered in full by the cold fluid. So for both the hot and
cold fluids, the heat transfer rate taking place can be related to the inlet and outlet
temperatures of each fluid as:
̇Q = ̇mhcp,h(Th,in −Th,out)
(2.50)
̇Q = ̇mccp,c(Tc,out −Tc,in)
(2.51)

148
2 Waste Heat Recovery
where ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W), Th and Tc are the hot and cold fluid tempera-
tures, respectively, (K), ̇mh and ̇mc are the hot and cold fluid mass flow rates (kg/s),
cp,h and cp,c are the hot and cold fluid specific heats (J/kg K), Th,in and Th,out are the
inlet and outlet temperatures for the hot fluid (K), and Tc,in and Tc,out the inlet and
outlet temperatures for the cold fluid (K). In addition, for convenience, the mass
flow rate and specific heat for a fluid are often combined into its heat capacity rate,
given by:
Ch = ̇mhcp,h
(2.52)
Cc = ̇mccp,c
(2.53)
Usually, the fluid heat capacities on the hot and cold sides are not the same in
which case the temperature differences between the hot and cold fluids on each side
of the HEX are not proportional. However, when the same fluid is used for both hot
and cold streams, the heat capacities of both hot and cold fluids are equal, which
then means that the respective inlet and outlet temperature differences for hot and
cold fluids will be proportional. Nonetheless, along the length of a HEX, the temper-
ature difference between the hot and cold fluids is not linear. In fact, in the case of a
parallel flow HEX, we can appreciate that a much higher rate of local heat transfer
is taking place at the inlet of the exchanger because this is where the hot fluid is at
its maximum temperature and the cold fluid is at its minimum. So, when looking at
the analysis, as tempting as it might be to use arithmetic mean of the inlet and outlet
temperatures to estimate the respective average fluid temperatures, a quick look at
fluid temperature profiles shows why such a simple estimate would be in error. To
illustrate the importance of this, the typical temperature profile trend lines for both
hot and cold fluids in the case of a double-pipe HEX with (a) a parallel flow and (b)
a counter-flow arrangement is illustrated in Figure 2.40.
Also, for design purposes, it is helpful to relate the heat transfer taking place
within a HEX to both the heat transfer area and the fluid temperatures. Therefore,
an expression in the form of Eq. (2.54) would be desirable:
̇Q = UAsΔX
(2.54)
where ΔX is a variable representing the hot and cold fluid temperatures – the objec-
tive here being to adapt Newton’s law of cooling for HEXs to find such an expres-
sion – for the differential analysis as detailed in Figure 2.41.
For the volume of fluid passing through the area dAS being studied, a quantity of
heat is transferred from the hot fluid to the cold fluid, the rate of which (𝛿̇Q) can be
related to the mass transfer rates and specific heats of both fluids from:
{ 𝛿̇Q = −̇mhcp,hdTh
𝛿̇Q = ̇mccp,cdTc
(2.55)
Now by isolating the temperatures, these become:

Hence the difference between the above two equations leading us to:
dTh −dTc =
𝛿̇Q
−̇mhcp,h
−
𝛿̇Q

(2.57)
Which can be rearranged as follows:
d(Th −Tc) = −𝛿̇Q
(

̇mhcp,h
+
1
̇mccp,c
)
(2.58)
But we know (on the studied control volume), that the heat transfer rate can also
be described by the Newton’s law of cooling from:
𝛿̇Q = UdAs(Th −Tc)
(2.59)
So by replacing the previous heat transfer rate by this expression, we get:
d(Th −Tc)
(Th −Tc) = −UdAs
(
1
̇mhcp,h
+
1
̇mccp,c
)
(2.60)
Hence, using this form of local analysis, it is possible to relate the fluid temper-
atures to the heat transfer area, and then to generalise this expression to one for
the overall heat exchange process by integration from the inlet to the outlet of the
exchanger. This integration giving us:
−ln
(Th,out −Tc,out
Th,in −Tc,in
)
= UAs
(

(2.61)
which by substituting the hot and cold fluid heat capacities gives [15, 16]:
ln
( Th,in −Tc,in
Th,out −Tc,out
)
= UAs
̇Q
(Th,in −Th,out + Tc,out −Tc,in)
(2.62)
And from which by a final rearrangement gives us the desired expression relating
the heat transfer rate taking place (within the whole HEX) to both the heat transfer
surface area and the fluids’ inlet and outlet temperatures as:
̇Q = UAs
(Th,in −Tc,in) −(Th,out −Tc,out)
ln (
Th,in−Tc,in∕Th,out−Tc,out
)
(2.63)
Showing, as it is more commonly noted, that it is possible to express the heat
transfer rate taking place within a HEX in terms of HEX surface area and fluid tem-
peratures by:
̇Q = UAsΔTlm = UAs
ΔT1 −ΔT2
ln (
ΔT1∕ΔT2
)
(2.64)
where ΔTlm is known as the LMTD, i.e. the logarithmic temperature difference
between the hot and cold fluid on both sides of the HEX. In addition, owing to the
properties of logarithms, the temperature differences ΔT1 and ΔT2 can be reversed
without changing the overall LMTD value, and the LMTD expression is valid

2.8 Design Development Methods

for both parallel flow and counter-flow HEXs provided we take the temperature
differences for both fluids according to the following geometry:
Parallel flow:
{ ΔT1 = Th,in −Tc,in
ΔT2 = Th,out −Tc,out
Counter flow:
{ΔT1 = Th,in −Tc,out
ΔT2 = Th,out −Tc,in
(2.65)
By setting the desired fluid temperatures, the LMTD method allows us to esti-
mate the heat exchange surface area required to achieve a given heat transfer rate
and for similar fluid temperatures, it can be noted that the LMTD for counter-flow
HEX is always greater than that of a parallel flow exchanger. Hence, for equivalent
heat transfer rates, counter-flow HEXs require smaller heat exchange surface areas
compared to parallel flow HEXs, and so in practice, counter-flow HEXs are often
preferred over their parallel flow counterparts.
Now it is important to note that earlier discussed LMTD expression is limited to
the cases of simple parallel flow and counter-flow HEXs. However, for more complex
geometries such as cross-flow HEXs or multi-pass HEXs, because it is convenient to
still use a similar method of design, we can relate the LMTD to that of a counter-flow
HEX by including a correction factor:
Cross flow∕multi pass: ΔTlm = FΔTlm,Counter flow
(2.66)
where F is a correction factor which varies between 0 and 1. Thus, the maximum
LMTD value that can be achieved by a cross-flow or multi-pass HEX is the LMTD
value that would be obtained by an equivalent counter-flow HEX with a similar heat
transfer surface area. Values of correction factor F are reported in the literature for
each type of HEX.
Within this section, we showed that the LMTD method allows us to size a HEX
when both inlet and outlet temperatures are fixed and known. Unfortunately, in
many cases the heat transfer rate and outlet temperatures of the fluids are not known
and the LMTD estimation of the performance of a given HEX would require a cum-
bersome iterative process. Hence, a second method (commonly used in the design
of HEXs) is the ε-NTU method.
2.8.2.3
Effectiveness-Number of Transfer Units (𝛆-NTU) Method
Developed by William Kays and Alexander London in 1955, the method considers
the performance for a HEX for a given heat transfer surface area (As), and typically,
the ε-NTU method aims at estimating the heat transfer rate taking place within the
exchanger and estimating both the hot and cold fluid outlet temperatures. As the
name implies, this approach is based on two dimensionless parameters: the effec-
tiveness of the exchanger ε and the number of transfer units NTU defined as:
𝜀=
̇Q
̇Qmax
= f(NTU)
(2.67)
NTU = UA
Cmin
(2.68)

152
2 Waste Heat Recovery
where 𝜀is the effectiveness of the HEX, ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W), and ̇Qmax
is the maximum heat transfer rate achievable by the HEX (W). NTU is the number
of transfer units, U is the overall heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), A is the heat
transfer area (m2), and Cmin is the minimum heat capacity rate (W/K).
The objective of the ε-NTU technique is to directly estimate the effectiveness of
the HEX 𝜀by expressing it as a function of the number of transfer units NTU. And
because it is relatively simple to determine the maximum achievable heat trans-
fer rate, if the effectiveness of a HEX can be estimated, it will then be possible to
predict both the heat transfer rate for the system and the fluid outlet temperatures
[16, 17]. By definition, a fluid with a low heat capacity will undergo a greater change
in temperature compared to a fluid with a higher heat capacity. So, the maximum
achievable heat transfer rate can be obtained from cases where the fluid with mini-
mum heat capacity reaches the temperature of the other fluid. That is:
̇Qmax = Cmin(Th,in −Tc,in)
(2.69)
where Cmin is the minimum heat capacity rate of the fluids employed (W/K), Th,in
is the inlet temperature of the hot fluid (K), and Tc,in is the inlet temperature of the
cold fluid (K).
Now to estimate the number of transfer units for a given HEX, the overall
heat transfer coefficient U is first required, but this can be estimated by using
the electrical–thermal resistance network analogy previously discussed and by
considering the conduction and forced convection thermal resistances of the HEX.
To simplify the process, a number of effectiveness correlations have been developed
for various standard HEX configurations, and for convenience, these equations use
the capacity ratio (c), a dimensionless quantity denoting the ratio of the minimum
fluid heat capacity rate to the maximum, as given by:
c = Cmin
Cmax
(2.70)
And based on a similar approach to the one that we used to develop the logarith-
mic mean temperature difference expressions, correlations for the effectiveness of
several commonly used HEX configuration have been reported – some of which are
reported in Table 2.16.
So by using Table 2.16, the effectiveness of a HEX can be estimated. Then by using
the inlet temperatures and mass flow rates of both fluids and by estimating the max-
imum achievable heat transfer rate, the actual heat transfer rate taking place within
the HEX can be predicted in addition to the outlet temperatures for both fluids.

Regenerative and Recuperative Burners
The design of burners is a wide and complex subject which, even today, is not fully
understood [144]. And this is because for a complete theoretical investigation of
burners many elements such as the geometry and type of burner used, the fuel com-
bustion process, chemical reactions inside the burner, flame profile and intensity,
flashback, composition of the inlet and outlet streams, radiation between surfaces,

surface cooling, and others factors all have an impact on the thermal performance
of a burner. Usually, the design approach for burners is to firstly determine the
ideal heat flux profile and then adapt the design to reach the desired heat flux.
With the improvements in numerical techniques, it is tempting to use computa-
tional assistance to make the design process easier and if sizing software packages
for burners are recommended, then commercial computational fluid dynamic mod-
elling packages can be used – but limited to checking the overall energy balance
of the burners. To optimise the design and performance of a complete system, the
pinch point – defined as the point where the hot and cold streams are separated by
the minimum temperature difference during the process – is of interest. So to reach
optimal cost and energy targets, pinch point analysis consists of connecting the flows
requiring heating with those requiring cooling to decrease the pinch point to its most
favourable value, and if this first analysis deals with the overall design of burners,
then consideration of a WHR technology for the burners requires further considera-
tion. In burners, the total heat flux provided to the system by combustion is divided
between the actual heat flux used for the process and the heat losses conveyed to the
flue gases and burner surfaces is given by:
q′′
provided = q′′
process + q′′
losses
(2.80)

154
2 Waste Heat Recovery
where q′′ is the heat flux (W/m2). But in WHR, since the heat flux dedicated to the
process remains unchanged the objective is to maximise the heat recovery from the
losses rejected to the atmosphere. In burners, the two main WHR technologies are
regenerative and recuperative heaters and for both the objective is to reuse the heat
losses and reintroduce these to the system. By doing so, the total heat flux provided
to the system then partially comprises heat recovered from the losses, so decreasing
the overall amount of materials and lowering the cost of the energy required for the
burner. Even so, although the objective is similar, the two WHR systems for burners
require different technologies to reintroduce their waste heat.
2.8.3.1
Regenerative Burners
Regenerative burners consist of two separated burners, each with their own control,
and within an industrial process the two burners are used alternately. To explain,
during the operation of one burner, hot flue gas is used to heat solid heat exchange
media located so as to be ready to heat the inlet of the second burner. Once the
material is fully heated, the flow is switched so that the combustion air entering
the second burner is preheated by this hot heat exchange media and the flue gas
from the second burner is then used to heat the heat exchange media for the first
burner. And although different recuperative burners technologies exist, the princi-
ple remains similar: i.e. heat is transmitted from hot flue gas to a heat exchange
media by forced convection and is temporarily stored in the solid material for subse-
quent transient conduction. As previously noted, forced convection problems largely
depend on the flow velocity and geometry and correlations for the heat transfer coef-
ficients of forced convection consider the flow regime, turbulences, viscous forces,
and solid–fluid interactions. In practice, these correlations are commonly given in
terms of Nusselt number Nufc as:
Nufc =
hfcLc
k
= f(Re, Pr, ffriction)
(2.81)
Re = 𝜌vLc
𝜇
(2.82)
Pr =
cp𝜇
k
(2.83)
where hfc is the forced convection heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), Lc is the char-
acteristic length of the geometry (m), k is the fluid thermal conductivity (W/m K), Re
is the Reynolds number, Pr is the Prandtl number, f friction is the friction coefficient, 𝜌
is the fluid density (kg/m3), v is the velocity of the fluid (m/s), 𝜇is the fluid dynamic
viscosity (Pa s), and cp the fluid specific heat (J/kg K). Also, because of the transient
behaviours, Newton’s law of cooling is adapted as:
̇Q(t) = hfcA(Th −Tc(t))
(2.84)
where the heat transfer rate ̇Q (W) is a function of time t (seconds), hfc is the forced
convection heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), A is the heat transfer area of the solid

2.8 Design Development Methods
155
(m2), and Th is the temperature of the hot fluid (K) surrounding the solid at a tem-
perature Tc(t). As heat is transferred by forced convection from the hot flue gas to the
heat transfer medium, the temperature of the media changes with time as it stores
thermal energy. Between t = 0 and t = t, the total amount of heat stored (by the heat
exchange media) being given by:
q′′
provided = q′′
process + q′′
losses
(2.85)
Q = msystemcp(T(t) −Tt=0)
(2.86)
where Q is the total amount of heat stored by the heat exchange media (J), msystem
is the mass of the heat exchange media (kg), cp is the specific heat (J/kg K), T(t)
is the temperature of the heat exchange media at a time t = t (K), and Tt = 0 is the
initial temperature of the heat exchange media at a time t = 0. Depending on the
size and thermal conductivity of the material, the temperature of the heat exchange
media may be considered to be uniform or non-uniform, and when the temperature
is considered to be uniform within the material, the system is denoted as ‘lumped’.
To determine whether the solid material is lumped or not, the Biot number (Bi) is
introduced and characterises the ratio of convection heat transfer at the surface of
the solid to the conduction heat transfer within the body, i.e. by:
Bi =
hfc
k∕Lc
× ΔT
ΔT =
hfcLc
k
(2.87)
where hfc is the forced convection heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), k is the solid
thermal conductivity (W/m K), and Lc a characteristic length (m) given by:
Lc = V
A
(2.88)
where V is the solid volume (m3) and A the solid external surface (m2). When the
Biot number is lower than Bi ≤0.1, the temperature difference between the hot flue
gas and any point within the solid material differs by less than 5% [136]. And under
this condition it is generally accepted to consider the temperature distribution inside
the solid heat exchange media as being uniform in all the directions. From which,
if the heat exchange media is considered as lumped, its temperature T(t) after being
exposed to the hot flue gas from t = 0 to t = t can be estimated by [136, 138, 144]:
T(t) −Th
Tt=0 −Th
= e
−
hfc
𝜌cpLc ×t
(2.89)
where Th is the temperature of the hot exhaust fluid (K), Tt = 0 is the initial tem-
perature of the heat exchange media at a time t = 0, hfc is the forced convection
heat transfer coefficient (W/m2 K), 𝜌is the solid density (kg/m3), cp is the solid spe-
cific heat (J/kg K), Lc its characteristic length (m), and t is the time at which the
temperature of the solid is calculated. However, when the temperature of the heat
transfer media cannot be assumed to be uniform, then the analysis becomes more
complicated and transient conduction laws inside the solid body must be applied.
Now to determine the temperature at any location inside the heat exchange media,
both analytical and numerical methods can be used and for most problems, the

156
2 Waste Heat Recovery
exact analytical solution is an infinite series; for which it is common to approxi-
mate the solution by only considering the first term of the series. Unfortunately,
even for one-dimensional transient heat conduction with simple geometries, it is
still not convenient to deal with this one-term approximation and so many con-
stants are determined from data tables. As an example, the one-term approxima-
tions of one-dimensional transient conduction with a plane wall, a cylinder, and a
sphere are:
Plane wall:T(x, t) −Th

(2.92)
where x is the distance from the middle of the plane wall (m), L is half of the plane
wall thickness (m), r is the radial distance to the axis of rotation (m), and ro the outer
diameter (m). The dimensionless time constant τ being defined by:
{
𝜏= 𝛼t
L2 for a Plane wall
𝜏= 𝛼t
ro2 for a Cylinder or a Sphere
(2.93)
where 𝛼is the thermal diffusivity (m2/s), t is the time (s), L is half of the plane wall
thickness (m), and ro the outer diameter (m). The constants C1, C2, and C3 depend on
the Biot number and are obtained from Heisler/Gröber charts and tables are avail-
able in the literature. Helpfully, even for the simplest geometry, although we are
aware that these expressions are the approximations of a series, for 𝜏> 0.2, the error
made by this one-term approximation is still estimated to be less than 2%. Hence,
even considering estimating the first convection coefficient, determining the Biot
number for the heat transfer media, and using the above equations from the heat
transfer media geometry and heat transfer area, it is still possible to estimate the
time t at which the temperature of the heat transfer media will reach the temper-
ature of the hot flue gas, and this can provide a good estimate for the time period
between which the two burners should alternate.
2.8.3.2
Recuperative Burners
In recuperative burners, a HEX is placed between the outlet of the burner and its
inlet to directly re-inject the heat to the combustion air before it enters the furnace.
A major difference between recuperative burners and regenerative burners is there-
fore that recuperative burners operate in a steady-state mode whereas regenerative
burners use cyclic transient conditions to alternately store energy and then release
this. The implementation of a recuperative burner is similar to the sizing of HEXs
previously detailed in the relevant section, and in accord with HEX theory, Jenk-
ins and Mullinger [144], that counter-flow arrangements demonstrate better perfor-
mances than other dispositions, i.e. for a similar difference in temperature between
the inlets of the hot and cold streams, the relative heat transfer area needed to obtain

2.8 Design Development Methods
157
a given rise of temperature of the fluids is smaller in the case of a counter-current
flow compared to cross-flow and co-current flow geometries. So if the outlet tem-
perature of the flue gas is a significant requirement of the recuperative burner, the
LMTD method can be used to size the HEX. Alternatively, in cases where the outlet
temperature of the flue gas and of that for the combustion air entering the furnace
are not known, the ε-NTU method is recommended for estimating both the HEX
area and the fluid temperatures. However, to do so, often requires assumptions to be
made. Indeed, a common option in the design of HEXs is the use of iterative solutions
that calculate scenarios based on these assumptions and later, having compared the
results, to then adjust the assumptions and performed another calculation iteration.
For example, we could first assume the fluid outlet temperatures and so the size of
the HEX using the LMTD method. Then performing a second iteration based on the
HEX size just calculated, assumptions for the fluid outlet temperatures can be mod-
ified, and this calculation process repeated until the balance between the HEX area
required and the outlet temperatures of the fluids suits the designer. Lastly, mechan-
ical and pressure drop calculations can be addressed to realise the final design of the
recuperative burner.
2.8.4
Waste Heat Boilers
Typically, WHBs consist of large shell-and-tubes HEXs, with two main types of
WHBs reported in the literature regarding which fluid circulates inside and which
outside the tubes [145–147]. In cases where the hot exhaust gas circulates inside
the tubes, the liquid within the shell surrounds the hot pipes and boils. In this
scenario, a drum is generally placed on top of the waste heat boiler, linked with
the shell, and where vapour accumulates. Conversely, in cases where the flue gas
occupies the shell volume, the liquid circulates through the tubes and boils inside
the tubes to create a two-phase flow. To design a waste heat boiler, the HEX analysis
presented in Section 2.8.2 is used and in cases where the output temperature of
the flue gas is fixed or assumed, the necessary heat transfer area can be estimated
using the LMTD method. But, in cases where the outlet temperatures are not
known, then the ε-NTU method is more suitable. However, for both methods, the
overall heat transfer coefficient must be determined and in the specific case of
WHBs, a correlation to estimate the boiling heat transfer coefficient must be used.
Two types of boiling must also be differentiated. When a fluid is boiling without
motion, boiling is called pool boiling – a typical example being water boiling in a
pan. However, if the fluid is in motion when the phase change takes place, boiling
is designated as flow boiling, in which case, heat transfer consists of a mixture of
forced convective heat transfer together with two-phase heat transfer for the phase
change. In the cases where the liquid occupies the shell volume and surround the
tubes, heat is transferred inside the tubes from the hot gas to the solid tube material
by forced convection and then through the tube thickness by conduction and if
the liquid is not in motion, pool boiling takes place outside the tubes. Hence to
estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient, a pool boiling heat transfer coefficient
correlation must be used and currently, one of the most recommendable [142] pool

where q′′
boiling is the heat flux per unit surface area (W/m2), ilv is the latent heat of
vapourisation (J/kg), 𝜇l is the liquid dynamic viscosity (kg/m s), 𝜎is the liquid sur-
face tension (N/m), g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2), 𝜌l and 𝜌v are the density
of the liquid and vapour phases, respectively, (kg/m3), cp,l is the specific heat of the
liquid (J/kg K), and Prl = 𝜇cp/k the Prandtl number of the liquid with k the liquid
thermal conductivity (W/m K). The constant Csf depends on the solid/fluid charac-
teristics. In cases where the liquid circulates and boils inside the pipes, flow boiling
occurs and again in such cases, suitable correlations must be chosen to estimate the
flow boiling heat transfer coefficient. Similar to forced convection, flow boiling can
be internal or external. With external flow boiling, the boiling heat transfer coeffi-
cient can be improved by the motion of the fluid and the mechanisms taking place
are similar everywhere at the points of contact with the heat transfer surface. How-
ever, with internal flow boiling, the vapour cannot escape and so is forced to flow in
the liquid phase. So as we move along the tube, the portion of vapour phase relative
to the liquid phase increases. This is known as quality x and is defined as the ratio
of the vapour mass flux to the total mass flux:
x =
̇mv
̇mtot
=
̇mv
̇ml + ̇mv
(2.95)
where ̇m is the mass flux (kg/s) and the subscripts l, v, and tot referring to liquid,
vapour, and total, respectively. As these quantities change inside the tube so the
fluid dynamic evolves too, the two-phase flow development in a tube in addition
to the evolution of the flow boiling heat transfer coefficient evolution is illustrated
in Figure 2.42.
For which we can see that as the liquid enters the tube of the HEX, its temper-
ature is below the saturation point and heat transfer takes place by liquid forced
convection. As the fluid recovers thermal energy and approaches saturation condi-
tions, small bubbles start to form near the wall where the liquid is hotter. A bubbly
flow is forming and progressively increases the heat transfer coefficient. Even so,
the temperature of the bulk of the liquid does not reach the saturation temperature.
However, by the stirring action of bubbles forming and departing from the wall, the
complete liquid volume reaches saturation and larger core bubbles develop. Then
with a further increase in temperature, the bubble size increases and the bubbly flow
transits to a slug flow where large bubbles occupy most of the available space and
flow in unison with a volume of liquid, but once the vapour slugs are large enough
to join the remaining liquid phase, it is forced to form a film near the wall and is con-
strained by the vapour that occupies the core of the tube. At this stage, heat transfer
takes place from a hot wall to a thin liquid film which again significantly increases

the heat transfer coefficient, and as the liquid film flows and evaporates, its thick-
ness decreases which further enhances the heat transfer coefficient until a maximum
value is obtained. Indeed, at some point, dry patches appear on the wall where evap-
oration of the film is no longer possible resulting in a drop in the local heat transfer
coefficient because, at these points, only forced convection heat transfer between
solid wall and vapour can take place. Finally, the remainder of the liquid film and
droplets contained within the vapour volume evaporate and the flow quality reaches
x = 1. At this point, only single-phase vapour forced convection heat transfer occur
[136–138]. Hence, as you can imagine, estimating the flow boiling heat transfer coef-
ficient can be laborious as it changes locally with the both type and quality of flow.
For tubes where the flow type remains similar, consideration of a forced convec-
tion heat flux and then adding a pool boiling contribution can be a useful but crude
first estimation. Alternatively, as different equations are made available for each flow
type and are correlated in terms of fluid quality, one approximated solution is to take
an average for the flow quality through the tube and to use a suitable correlation for
that flow type. However, for more accurate solutions, you may need to consider an
infinitesimal section of the pipe, describe the evolution of the quality x and the heat
transfer coefficient on a differential volume, and then undertake an integral over the
complete tube length for which that heat transfer coefficient correlation is valid.
Plus, depending on the specific characteristics of the waste heat boiler, additional
design steps may also be required. For instance, some waste heat burners include an
auxiliary burner unit or an afterburner to compensate for any potential insufficiency
of waste heat [147]. Moreover, for some applications such as sulfur recovery units

160
2 Waste Heat Recovery
(SRUs), the implementation of a waste heat boiler must take into account the fact
that some oxidation reactions can be reversed. Specifically, as the gas passes through
the waste heat boiler and is cooled, recombination reactions can take place and so
change the gas composition and the heat transfer [146]. In the case of SRU units,
the recombination reactions are mainly exothermic and so would create additional
source of heat, but no matter whether the changes are exothermic or endothermic,
changes in the flue gas composition must be predicted and are of importance in the
choice of the HEX materials for a waste heat boiler.
2.8.5
Air Preheaters
With air preheaters, two technologies are typically used. With the plate type, the pre-
heater consists of a plate-type HEX where the hot and cold fluid circulating in the
HEX are separated by thin conducting plates. The equations to design a plate-type
HEX are similar to those presented previously in the heat exchanger section; the
LMTD method and ε-NTU method both being suitable as appropriate. However
an additional characteristic of the plate-type HEX and hence the calculation of the
forced convective heat transfer coefficient is that to improve the heat transfer, the
plates are usually embossed or corrugated, and the type of corrugation leads to dif-
ferences in the forced convective flow. Example of different plate corrugation are
presented in Figure 2.43 [139].
For each type of plate, the corrugation increases the total heat transfer area of a
plate, and so to consider this enhancement, a plate enlargement factor 𝛷is added,
in the form [139]:
Atot = 𝛷× w × L
(2.96)
where Atot is the total heat transfer area of a plate (m2), w is the plate width (m), L
is the plate length (m), and 𝛷is the plate area enlargement factor – usually in the
range 1.15 < 𝛷< 1.25. In addition, in the design of a PHE, any additional friction

2.8 Design Development Methods
161
caused by the corrugation also impacts the pressure drop and this must be balanced
during the design stage.
In HPHEs, the exchanger can be analysed as two HEXs. At the heat source side, a
first heat exchange takes place as the hot flue gas gives its thermal energy to the heat
pipes. Then at the heat sink side, the heat pipes yields its thermal energy to the cold
incoming air. Hence to size a heat pipe HEX, the LMTD method and ε-NTUs method
can both be used but may require some specific adjustment. For example, to use the
ε-NTU analysis method, the two sections (namely evaporator and condenser) must
be analysed separately. And as heat pipe HEXs usually consist as a bank of heat pipes,
to estimate the overall efficiency of the HPHE, the efficiency of one single row must
first be determined. Now, in the case of a heat pipe-based HEX, since a phase change
occurs inside the heat pipe, the temperature of the working fluid remains constant
when heat is absorbed. Therefore, by definition, its specific heat cp and heat capacity
rate C approach infinity and as a result, the capacity ratio Cr = Cmin/Cmax tends to
zero and the effectiveness of a single row becomes [136]:
●Evaporator:
𝜀e,1 row = 1 −exp(−NTUe) with NTUe = UeAe
Ce
●Condenser:
𝜀c,1 row = 1 −exp(−NTUc) with NTUc = UcAc
Cc
(2.97)
where, in the above equations, the subscript e and c refer to evaporator and con-
denser, A represents the exchange area of one single row (m2), C is the average
heat capacity of the fluids (W/∘C), and U is the overall heat transfer coefficient of
the considered sections. Then to obtain the number of transfer units NTU for each
section, the factor UA must be evaluated using forced convection correlations and
for a second calculation, the effectiveness of the complete evaporator and complete
condenser sections, with a number ne and nc of heat pipes rows, respectively, are
determined. Again, as boiling and condensation of the working fluid inside the heat
pipe takes place, the system can be studied as a boiler and condenser and the effec-
tiveness of the total evaporator and condenser can be simplified by [137]:
●Evaporator:
𝜀e,ne =
( 1−Cr,e𝜀e,1row
1−𝜀e,1row
)ne −1
( 1−Cr,e𝜀e,1row
1−𝜀e,1row

→
𝜀e,ne = 1 −(1 −𝜀e,1row)ne
●Condenser:

1−𝜀e,1row
)nc −1
( 1−Cr,c𝜀c,1row
1−𝜀c,1row
)nc −Cr,c
Cr=0
→
𝜀c,nc = 1 −(1 −𝜀c,1row)nc
(2.98)

162
2 Waste Heat Recovery
Finally with the overall effectiveness of the evaporator section 𝜀e,ne and that of the
condenser section 𝜀c,nc, the total HEX effectiveness 𝜀HPHE can be determined from
which fluid has the largest heat capacity rate [136, 137, 148], i.e.:
If Cc > Ce ∶
𝜀HPHE =
(
1
𝜀e,ne
+ Ce∕Cc
𝜀c,nc
)−1
If Ce > Cc ∶
𝜀HPHE =
(
1
𝜀c,nc
+ Cc∕Ce
𝜀e,ne
)−1
(2.99)
Using this process, the efficiency of the heat pipe-based HEX can be estimated,
and then, as with other types of HEXs, the surface area can be determined.
For air preheaters, three main technologies are widespread: recuperators, regen-
erators, and RAC air preheaters. The RAC type presents similarities with heat
pipe-based HEXs as this system comprises two different sections that need separate
analysis. At the supply section, similar to the evaporator section for HPHE, the hot
flue gas gives up its thermal energy to a fluid within the coil through a first HEX.
Heat is then transported by the fluid through the coil and used to preheat the air
at the second HEX. This section is designated as the exhaust section and is similar
to the condenser section of heat pipe HEXs, and to make things easier, the two
sections are commonly called the ‘hot’ HEX and ‘cold’ HEX. For each RAC system
and depending on the application, the rate of circulation of the working fluid
between the two HEXs is a critical to the design [149]. So setting the optimum rate
of circulation is very important for attaining the highest possible system efficiency
and minimum costs. RAC air preheaters can be symmetrical or asymmetrical,
depending on whether the hot and cold HEXs are the same or not. For symmetrical
RAC systems, the secondary fluid temperature distribution can be represented as
[150] (Figure 2.44):

2.8 Design Development Methods
163
In this case (where the system is symmetric and both HEXs have the same size),
the temperature of the secondary fluid circulating is given by [150]:
ts,1 = 1
2(Th,1 + Tc,1)
ts,2 = 1
2(Th,2 + Tc,2)
(2.100)
where ts is the temperature of the secondary fluid circulating (K), th is the tempera-
ture of the hot exhaust gas (K), and tc the temperature of cold air to be preheated (K).
Then from the previous temperatures of the secondary fluids, the mass circulation
rate is related by a heat balance as:
̇ms =
̇Q
cp,s(Ts,1 −Ts,2)
(2.101)
where ̇ms is the secondary fluid mass flow rate (kg/s), ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W),
and cp,s the secondary fluid specific heat (J/kg K). For asymmetrical RAC systems,
additional information regarding the two HEXs being used is required in order to
estimate the optimum mass flow rate of the secondary fluid. But by balancing the
cost of each HEX and their overall heat transfer coefficients, Emerson [150] found
the optimum ratio of temperature differences 𝛽as:
𝛽≡
ΔTh
ΔTh + ΔTc
=
1
1 +
√(
pcUh
phUc
)
(2.102)
where ΔTh and ΔTc are the mean temperature differences in the hot and cold HEXs
(K), ph and pc are the costs per unit area of heat transfer surface in the hot and cold
HEXs (currency/m2), and Uh and Uc are the overall heat transfer coefficients for
both HEXs (W/m2 K). Using which, the secondary fluid temperatures for an asym-
metric RAC HEX can then be estimated from:
ts,1 = Th,1 −𝛽(Th,1 −Tc,1)
ts,2 = Th,2 −𝛽(Th,2 −Tc,2)
(2.103)
Finally, the optimum mass transfer rate of the secondary fluid for an asymmet-
rical RAC air preheater can be estimated using Eq. (2.101). In addition to the HEX
design methods presented earlier in this section, with RAC systems, the designer
may also need to consider heat losses from the secondary fluid. Obviously, this phe-
nomenon is amplified with increasing distance between the hot and cold HEXs and
poor insulation of the secondary piping.
With recuperator air preheaters, cold air is circulating outside of a cylinder in
which the hot flue gas flows. So before it can be used, thermal energy is first given
to the cylinder walls and only then retransmitted to the air. However, in addition to
forced convection heat transfer taking place, recuperators typically also make use
of radiation to transmit heat from the hot surface to the air, and in the cases where
the recuperator air preheater consists of two concentric tubes, radiative heat trans-
fer not only takes place between the hot inner cylinder to the air circulating, but
also between the outer cylinder wall and the air. Indeed, a significant part of the

164
2 Waste Heat Recovery
radiation emitted by the inner surface is received by the outer cylinder wall and
scattered. Therefore, to design recuperator preheaters, a basic knowledge of radiative
heat transfer is required.
Radiative bodies such as surfaces and gases are usually compared to an ideal radia-
tive case known as the blackbody model. A blackbody is a perfect absorber and
emitter of radiation and at any given temperature, the total emitted energy from
the blackbody is the maximum possible. In practice, surfaces radiate less energy
than black bodies and are therefore designated as grey bodies and to characterise the
radiation intensity of a grey body, a total hemispherical emissivity factor (𝜀s) is intro-
duced which represents the ratio of the radiation emitted by the grey body at a given
temperature to the radiation that would be emitted by a perfect blackbody at the
same temperature. Now the radiative heat flux emitted by a surface per unit surface
area is designated as irradiation (G) and when a surface or semi-transparent body
receives a given quantity of irradiation, (say G), this radiative heat flux is divided into
three components: one portion is reflected, one portion is absorbed, and the rest is
transmitted. So to help describe this effect, three ratios are introduced, namely the
reflectivity 𝜌s, the absorptivity 𝛼s, and the transmissivity 𝜏s and these are given by:
𝜌s =
Gref
G
𝛼s = Gabs
G
𝜏s = Gtrs
G
(2.104)
The reflectivity, absorptivity, and transmissivity of a body are always constrained
between 0 and 1, and in the case of recuperator air preheaters, the air gas flow-
ing between the cylindrical surfaces also participates in the absorption and emis-
sion process because it contains asymmetric molecules such as H2O and CO2 [151,
152]. Hence, the reflected, absorbed, and transmitted irradiation from the gas can be
schematised as per Figure 2.45.

In practice, the incident radiation that a material receives (such as the gas in the
case of air preheater) comes from different sources, different directions, and with
different wavelengths. Accordingly, the reflectivity, absorptivity, and transmissivity
of the body can vary locally, but for simplicity, these characteristics are usually aver-
aged on a whole body consideration and where if these properties are independent
of the wavelength of the received radiation, the body is designated ‘grey’.
When radiative heat transfer occurs between two surfaces, the orientation of the
two surfaces influences the transfer and the radiation properties. To consider this
effect, a view factor (Fi →j) is introduced which represents the fraction of the radia-
tion leaving a surface i that then strikes a surface j. So, in the general case, the view
factor of a surface 1 to a surface 2 is given by [137]:
F1→2 = 1
A1 ∫A1∫A2
cos 𝜃1 cos 𝜃2
𝜋r2
dA1dA2
(2.105)
where r is the distance between the surfaces dA1 and dA2 (m), and θ1 and θ2 are
the angles between the normals to their respective surfaces and the line connecting
dA1 and dA2. Note that in the case of cylinders and concave surfaces, a surface can
have a view factor relative to itself. Also, because the view factor can be considered
from the viewpoint of both surfaces A1 and A2, a reciprocity for view factors is also
observed as:
A1F1→2 = A2F2→1
(2.106)
If a surface completely surrounds the other, the view factor is unity. However, most
of the time, the view factor between surfaces and bodies must be estimated and esti-
mating the view factor between surfaces and between the bodies implied in the heat
transfer process can be difficult. Correlations and equations reported in the literature
for the simplest cases may be used or adapted and so for cylindrical recuperator’s air
preheaters, it is possible to consider these as two cylinders between which the air
flows and is preheated [136–138].
Using an electrical analogy, it is often convenient to write the radiative heat trans-
fer rate as the ratio of a difference in potential to a radiation resistance. To do so, the
radiosity (Ji) is introduced and which represents the total radiative energy leaving
a surface i per unit area per unit of time. Using this analogy, we can consider that
the radiosity from a surface consists of both the emitted radiative energy and the
reflected radiative energy from that surface, and so, based on the concept of view
factor and radiosity, the radiative heat transfer rate from a surface i to a surface j can
be written as:
̇Qi→j =
Ji −Jj
Ri→j
(2.107)
where ̇Qi→j is the radiative heat transfer rate from surface ‘i’ to surface j (W), Ji and
Jj are the respective radiosities (W/m2), and Ri →j is the space radiative resistance
(m−2) defined by:
Ri→j =
1
AiFi→j
(2.108)

166
2 Waste Heat Recovery
and where Ai is the surface i (m2) and Fi →j the view factor from surface i to j. For
the situation where several surfaces or bodies exchange radiative heat transfer, the
problem can be solved using standard electrical network calculation employing the
previously described potentials and resistances. So for surfaces with a specific heat
transfer rate, the net heat transfer rate ̇Qi from a surface i to a number N of surfaces
can be given by [136]:
̇Qi = Ai
N
∑
j=1
Fi→j(Ji −Jj)
(2.109)
Whereas for surfaces with specific temperatures, this temperature Ti can be
obtained from:
𝜎sbTi
4 = Ji +
1 −𝜀s,i
𝜀s,i
N
∑
j=1
Fi→j(Ji −Jj)
(2.110)
where 𝜎sb ≈5.67 × 10−8 W/m2 K4 and is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and 𝜀s,i is
the surface emissivity. Hence using the above equations for all the bodies and sur-
faces implied in a radiative heat transfer between N number of surfaces and so N
radiosity transfers, these can then be solved for that system. For gas and gas mixture
especially, the emissivity has been reported in existing literature and data tables.
Also, we need to remember that for regenerators and rotary regenerators, the sys-
tem design is based on transient conduction principles. Therefore, transient conduc-
tion laws described in the regenerative burner section need to be applied.
2.8.6
Heat Recovery Steam Generator
In HRSGs, energy from hot exhaust gas coming from burners is recovered in order to
produce steam – the hot gas successively passing through three exchangers, namely
the superheater, the evaporator, and the economiser. As for the water line, water
circulates in the opposite direction, and to better understand the heat transfer pro-
cess taking place within the water circuit, the temperature–enthalpy diagram of the
process is illustrated in Figure 2.46.
Pressurised water liquid is first supplied by a feed pump to the economiser where
it is heated but remains below the saturation point (State A to B). The warm water
liquid is then introduced to the evaporator where it reaches its saturation point,
after which boiling takes place and vapour is created. During this process a phase
change takes place and the energy provided by the HRSG is completely used for
the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the vapour phase. Note also that during
the phase change the temperature of the system remains constant (State B to C).
The liquid and gaseous phases are then separated in a drum and the vapour is sent
to the superheater where it is heated further – this stage being mainly used to bring
the vapour to the desired conditions to match user requirement and, in the case
where steam is used to drive a turbine, maximise the efficiency for electricity pro-
duction. The presented stages are common to all HRSGs. However, depending on
the application, different options can be added to a steam generator for further ther-
mal treatment of the steam. For instance, following initial use by a process, some

HRSGs may also include a reheater to reheat and so reuse the steam. In addition,
depending on the number of drums in the boiler, the HRSG can be a single-, dual-,
or triple-pressure type, the advantage of adding several drums in a HRSG being to
change the pressure in each line, which then changes the boiling point of the water.
Hence, in a triple-pressure-type HRSG, a high-pressure, intermediate-pressure, and
low-pressure sections are used to increase the overall performance.
For design purposes, the pressure chosen is highly significant and is connected to
the thermal cycle operated during the process. So to design a HRSG, several design
steps are usually recommended. Firstly, the need for the steam, its application, and
thus the requirements expected of the steam must be identified. Then, depending
upon the use for the steam, the quality, temperature, and pressure needed from
the HRSG may differ and so impact the sizing of the equipment. In such consid-
erations, both short-term and long-term requirements must be anticipated and it is
common practice to over produce and allow excess steam to be created to ensure
that the minimum amount of steam required can always be supplied. Nevertheless,
even where accurate predictions are aimed at such generalised requirements, when-
ever possible, designs should remain relatively simple so as to limit the cost of an
installation [153].
The design stages can generally be divided into preliminary design, detailed
design, and final design. During the preliminary design, the objective is to rapidly
provide the first concept for the system without involving numerous resources. The
mass and material balance of the water and steam circuit providing a first idea for
the required heat transfer rates. Where applicable, the designer may also extrapolate
the new design from existing systems which then allows for a better estimate for the
size, performance, and cost for a new HRSG system. Then for detailed design, the

first step is to better characterise the steam, the hot exhaust fluid, and the working
environment. The composition and temperature range of the exhaust gas is crucial
as the chemical particles within the gas may affect the performance of the HEX
and react with the materials chosen. However, at this stage will also aim to design
the heat transfer surfaces, optimise the surface area, and improve the compactness
of the system whilst still reaching the desired performance. The stage is crucial
and is a key challenge in the design of an installation, and as a first approach, the
economiser, evaporator, and superheater can be considered as three counter-current
HEXs operating in series. A schematic analysis of a HRSG and its temperature
profile are presented in Figure 2.47.
The temperature profiles of the flue gas line and of the water/steam line are linked
by the heat balance equation:
̇Q = ̇Qh = ̇Qc = ̇mh(ih,in −ih,out) = ̇mc(ic,out −ic,in)
(2.111)
where ̇Q is the heat transfer rate (W), ̇mh and ̇mc are the hot and cold fluid mass flow
rates (kg/s), and i the enthalpy (kJ/kg). In HRSGs, two parameters are of significant
importance: The pinch point and the approach point and these two points can be
measured at the evaporator section. At the exit of the economiser, the water is in
its liquid stage at a temperature lower than the saturation temperature and the dif-
ference between this temperature and the saturation temperature of water is called
the approach point. The approach point therefore describes the amount of energy
required by the evaporator before the water liquid phase turns to steam, and, not
surprisingly, designers typically try to reduce the approach point as much as pos-
sible whilst still maintaining a safe margin to ensure that the water remains liquid

2.8 Design Development Methods
169
within the circuit before the evaporator. On the other hand, the pinch point is the
temperature difference between the flue gas leaving the evaporator and the satu-
ration temperature and this point represents the location where the design is most
constrained. To limit costs and maximise the performance of a HRSG, pinch and
approach point are normally in the range of 10–15 ∘C [59]. So in practice, the pinch
and approach points are often the starting points for thermal calculations and it is
not uncommon to first set and assume both the pinch and approach points and only
then estimate the temperatures and size of the system.
Now since these systems are typical HEXs, the LMTD and ε-NTU method are both
central in the thermal design of HRSGs, but as the outlet temperatures of the streams
are not known, the area calculation is typically estimated using the ε-NTUs tech-
nique with the equation:
A = NTU × Cmin

where A is the heat transfer area (m2), NTU is the number of transfer units, Cmin is
the minimum heat capacity rate (W/K), and U the overall heat transfer coefficient
(W/m2 K).
To use the ε-NTU method, the overall heat transfer coefficient of the HEX is
required, but this can be determined using an appropriate equivalent thermal
resistance network and suitable conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer
correlations. However, within the evaporator, boiling takes place and so two-phase
heat transfer must be considered for the prediction of the HRSG performance.
To estimate the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient, the pool boiling model by
Rohsenow [141] is recommended. Once the overall heat transfer coefficient of the
HEXs is estimated, the outlet temperatures of both fluids and the size of the HEX
can be estimated using the ε-NTUs method.
Optimum system geometries and arrangement will also be studied using heat
transfer analysis, using different simulations and considering several scenarios.
Finally, a control for the steam quality and temperature may also be relevant
depending on the desired steam requirements. The overheating of steam and its
cooling using an attemperator is a common practice to reach the expected steam
conditions (the attemperator sprays water droplets into the superheated steam to
ensure that the downstream, mixed, steam temperature will not adversely affect
downstream components). A second step is generally the fluid mechanical design
where the designer selects the number of drums, the pumps, fans, and blowers.
And a critical choice in the design of HRSGs is the number of drums and therefore
the number of pressurised water lines. Depending on the number of drums, a
HRSG can be single, dual, or triple pressure type. Alternatively and conversely to
studying the number of drums and hence the assisted circulation of water within
their pressurised sections, the designer may also consider using natural circulation
to reduce the cost of the installation. Whereas assisted circulation HRSGs mainly
have a vertical gas path, for natural circulation, the exhaust gas path is generally
horizontal. Therefore, depending on the available space, the implementation of
the steam generator that requires a high vertical chimney or a long horizontal

170
2 Waste Heat Recovery
ducting may not be practical. Whereas although natural circulation HRSGs have
the advantages of being more economical, use less energy and more reliable and
safer in earthquakes zones, their start-up times from cold are usually longer and
greater maintenance is required. Also in the selection of fans and blowers, pressure
drop most be considered and a similar analysis should be undertaken for the water
and steam lines to estimate the pressure drop and head required for their pumps.
Last but not least, within this stage the two-phase flow must be considered in
relation to sizing and this may also require an analysis of the natural convection
streams relevant to protect zones where steam can naturally accumulate. Perhaps it
is obvious, but it needs to be stated that in all cases of equipment selection, standard
sizes are advised to reduce the cost.
In the design of HRSG, different types of evaporators can be selected. The D-frame
evaporator is the most compact form of evaporator and is therefore best suited for
small turbines or for restricted areas as opposed to O-frame evaporators which are
advised for larger gas flows. Alternatively, the I-frame evaporator is relatively eco-
nomical and adaptable which has made them very popular. In addition, it is common
to choose the number of rows in the tube bundles and the orientation of paral-
lel modules if the I-frame evaporator is constructed from several modules. In the
mechanical design stage, tube materials and their thickness are of interest – the
tube materials and size usually being determined according to their operating tem-
perature and pressure range within the system. However, if tubes need to be sized
according to their structural or mechanical requirements, a balance must be found
because thicker tubes deteriorate the heat transfer performances. In addition, tube
supports are also sized according to a stress analysis and the loads that need to
be supported. Furthermore, regarding the design of supports and enclosures, envi-
ronmental factors such as wind, seismic risk, and soil condition must be included.
Headers and drums are also sized during the mechanical design stage but in addi-
tion, the composition of the exhaust gas and its possible interaction with any chosen
solid materials must be considered.
Indeed, during the heat transfer process, particles from the exhaust gas can accu-
mulate, decrease the heat transfer performance, and, in the worst cases, damage the
material. In particular, attention must be made to ensure that the design keeps the
flue gas above its dew point to prevent condensation taking place within the HEX
because condensation and formation of liquid from an exhaust gas can lead to the
appearance of acids that would threaten the complete installation.
Lastly, in the final design step, all the previous steps need to be reviewed and
detailed further, manufacturing drawings are generated, and the final design is tested
in simulations according to their different working conditions. Amongst others, the
extent of emission levels need to be checked.
2.8.7
Heat Pumps
In heat pumps, a thermodynamic cycle is used to transport energy from one location
to another. This is achieved by the means of a working fluid travelling from a hot
exchanger where heat is recovered to a cold exchanger where the heat is released,

2.8 Design Development Methods
171
and in vapour compression heat pumps, the working fluid used to transport this
heat exists in two different phases. At the evaporator HEX, the liquid phase of the
working fluid evaporates and turns to vapour, but conversely, at the condenser, the
vapour condenses back to the liquid phase. In the context of WHR, the evapora-
tor HEX needs to be placed within the hot exhaust stream from which the thermal
energy is to be recovered. Whereas the location of the condenser HEX depends on
the end use for this recovered heat. For example, in cases where the cold HEX is used
to preheat an air stream, the vapour compression heat pump system looks similar to
the RAC air preheater system previously discussed, but heat pumps are widely used
due to the higher efficiencies explained by the nature their two phases of working
fluid flow. Indeed, the evaporation and condensation heat transfer coefficients are
significantly higher than those of forced convection. Also, another major difference
for heat pumps is their use of a compressor and an expansion valve that provides a
thermodynamic treatment of the working fluid and assures circulation of the sys-
tem fluid. So to design vapour compression heat pumps, the thermodynamic cycle
on which the system rely should be studied, a schematised explanation of which is
presented in Figure 2.48.
At the evaporator HEX, the liquid phase of the working fluid absorbs heat from
the flue gas and transforms to saturated vapour. Even so, this vapour remains at

a relatively low temperature and pressure (State 1). Then to ensure circulation of
the working fluid and improve heat transfer, a compressor increases the vapour
pressure and thus the temperature. At this point electrical power is supplied to the
system and the work undertaken by the compressor is conveyed as additional energy.
At the outlet from the compressor, the high-pressure vapour is superheated and
reached the highest temperature of the cycle (State 2). Then, a high-pressure line
leads the vapour to the condenser where the waste heat is released by condensa-
tion of the working fluid inside another HEX. The working fluid remains at a high
pressure, but its temperature decreases as thermal energy is transferred. Leaving the
condenser, the working fluid exists in a liquid phase at high pressure and medium
temperature (State 3), and finally, the working fluid moves from the high-pressure
line to the low-pressure line by passing through the expansion valve. In doing so,
the decrease of pressure brings a decrease of temperature. This can be seen on the
temperature–entropy diagram and during this transition (State 3 to 4), a portion of
liquid may turn to vapour. Hence, after the expansion valve, the working fluid is a
liquid/vapour mixture at low pressure and low temperature (State 4).
From the described thermodynamic principles of heat pumps, several design lim-
its can be identified. To begin with, at the evaporator, the saturation temperature of
the working fluid at low pressure must be lower than the flue gas temperature for
evaporation to take place. Similarly, at the condenser, the pressure delivered by the
compressor must be set so that the condensation temperature of the refrigerant at
this high pressure is higher than the temperature of the cold fluid going through
the condenser [154]. In addition, during the transition from high-pressure liquid to
low pressure within the expansion valve, vapour can appear which, if in significant
amounts at this stage, can reduce the performance of the heat pump because a part
of the working fluid will already exist in the vapour phase before going through the
evaporator. To reduce this, heat pumps can be designed so that they sub-cool the liq-
uid after the condenser and by doing so, reduce pressure of the working fluid within
the expansion valve and so eliminate vapour formation allowing the entire liquid
volume to then evaporate within the hot HEX [154].
To estimate the performance of a heat pump, an important efficiency measure
for heat pumps is the COP. This coefficient represents the ratio of the useful out-
put energy to the energy supplied to the system in the form of work. The COP is
given by:
COP = useful output
power input =
̇Qcondenser
Wprovided
(2.113)
where ̇Qcooling is the heat transfer rate recovered at the condenser (W) and Wprovided
is the work provided to the system in the form of electrical power (W). For a heat
pump system to be economically viable, the COP should be higher than 2.5 [154],
and in the case of an ideal thermodynamic cycle (as presented in Figure 2.48.), the
COP can be expressed according the enthalpy of the working fluid in its different
states as:
COP = i2 −i3
i2 −i1
(2.114)

2.8 Design Development Methods
173
where i is the enthalpy (kJ/kg), and the subscripts 1, 2, 3 refer to the working fluid
states. Similarly, the evaporator cooling capacity ( ̇qevap) is defined by [155]:
̇qevap = i1 −i4
(2.115)
the heat released at the condenser ( ̇qcooling) by [155]:
̇qcondenser = i1 −i4
(2.116)
and the work provided by the compressor (wprovided) as [155]:
wprovided = i2 −i1
(2.117)
The enthalpy noted can be read from the phase diagram of the working fluid
selected. To check the equilibrium of the system at steady state, the amount of energy
given to the system must be equal to the energy leaving it – for which the following
equation is appropriate:
̇Qevaporator + Wprovided = ̇Qcondenser
(2.118)
where ̇Qevaporator is the heat transfer rate from the hot flue gas to the working fluid at
the evaporator (W), Wprovided is the work provided to the system by the compressor
(W), and ̇Qcondenser the heat transfer rate that is recovered at the condenser (W).
However, in addition to the HEX theories used to size the evaporator and con-
denser HEXs, several other design characteristics of heat pumps are also important
to develop a heat pump system – the most important component of which is the
compressor, and this needs to be appropriately chosen according to the pressure and
temperature needed at the condenser. The objective is to ensure that the condensa-
tion temperature of the refrigerant is higher than the inlet temperature of the fluid
used to recover heat. In addition, the choice of the compressor must be balanced
against the relatively long life of heat pump systems and their operating conditions
of noise, vibration, and the frequency of necessary maintenance [154]. The compres-
sor is very decisive in the performance of a heat pump and is the element with the
largest impact on the COP figure. In heat pumps, contrary to many refrigeration sys-
tems, the electric motor does not need to be oversized as it is usually underloaded
[154]. Then the choice of the refrigerant is usually made by considering its suitabil-
ity for the condensing pressure of the working fluid and the temperature of the fluid
used to recover the thermal energy. Finally the piping should aim at reduce the flow
resistance.
2.8.8
Direct Electrical Conversion Device
Direct electrical conversion devices create electricity directly from a difference of
temperature applied to their surface and in the context of WHR, hot flue gas can be
used to heat one side of a direct electrical device which then produces electricity.
Direct electrical conversion devices use four different technologies for this electric-
ity generation: thermoelectric, piezoelectric, thermionic, and thermophotovoltaic
(TPV), and since the design of such systems depend on their operation, these four
categories are discussed separately in the following paragraphs:

174
2 Waste Heat Recovery
With thermoelectric generation, a device made from semiconductor material gen-
erates electricity when its surfaces are exposed to different temperatures. Using the
effect noted by Seebeck, heated electrons travel to the cooler side of the material and
thereby generate a current. The current density (Jel) from a module is a function of
the gradient of temperature applied and is given by:
Jel = 𝜎el(−∇V + Eemf)
(2.119)
Eemf = −S∇T
(2.120)
where 𝜎el is the local electrical conductivity (S/m), V is the local voltage (V), Eemf
is the electromagnetic field, S is the Seebeck coefficient (V/K), and T the tempera-
ture (K). To provide a measure of thermoelectric performance for these generators,
a thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) has been introduced as given by:
zT = S2𝜎elT
k
(2.121)
where k is the thermal conductivity of the TEG material (W/m K). Then from this
thermoelectric figure of merit, the efficiency of the TEM (𝜂TEG) can be defined as
[156–158]:
𝜂TEG =
[(Th −Tc)
Th
] ⎡
⎢
⎢⎣
√
1 + zT −1
√
1 + zT + Tc
Th
⎤
⎥
⎥⎦
(2.122)
where Th is the temperature of the hot side of the TEG (K), Tc is the temperature
of the cold side of the TEG (K), and zT the thermoelectric figure of merit. In the
design of TEG, we need to be aware that these modules have relatively low efficien-
cies (5% [6]) and a high conversion resistance in the range of 1.5 ∘C/W [157, 158].
Therefore, the temperature gradients imposed on TEGs need to be relatively high.
In this regard, the choice of material must also consider the difficult mechanical and
thermal conditions in which these modules operate, and so the stresses and fatigue
induced within the materials. Hence to improve their power output, TEGs are gener-
ally placed in series, and since the heat sink and heat source are usually separated, it
is common to use high thermal conductivity devices to transport the thermal energy
from the heat source to the TEG. For instance, heat pipes can be used to recover
waste heat from a flue gas and convey this energy directly to a TEG module [157].
In piezoelectric power generation, vibration of a material (such as a membrane)
is used and converted to electricity [159], and in the context of WHR, the waste
heat uses a thermoacoustic–piezoelectric (TAP) device to create the vibrations from
the temperature gradient [160]. This device consists of five sections: the heat cav-
ity, the stack, a resonator tube, a Helmholtz resonator cavity, and the piezoelectric
diaphragm. When heat is applied to the heat cavity, a temperature gradient is gen-
erated within the stack which releases acoustic waves. These acoustic waves are
then amplified by the resonator and used to create electricity from the piezoelectric
section. The governing piezoelectric equation for the coupling between the acoustic

2.8 Design Development Methods
175
and electrical fields is given by [160]:
{xcenter(i𝜔)
qelec(i𝜔)
}
=
[Y11(i𝜔) Y12(i𝜔)
Y21(i𝜔) Y22(i𝜔)
] {ΔP(i𝜔)
V(i𝜔)
}
(2.123)
where xcenter is the centre point deflection depending on the piezo-diagram frequency
(m), 𝜔is the frequency of the oscillation (Hz), qelec is the charge (C), Y is the admit-
tance (S), ΔP is the pressure across the element (Pa), V is the voltage (V), Y 11 is the
acoustic admittance, Y 22 is the electrical admittance, and Y 12 and Y 21 are the coupled
electroacoustic admittances. It should be noted that piezoelectric power generation
from WHR systems is still at an early stage and are currently being developed to
provide better conversion performances. This means that piezoelectric power gen-
erators can only be profitable by using high-power generation capacity piezoelectric
material, but high reliability and good stability are also necessary to decrease main-
tenance costs and allow for easy control of the piezoelectric power generator [161].
Moreover, the resonance frequency of the self-charging assembly needs to be studied
and adapted to fit the excitation frequency and so maximise the piezoelectric power
output. When doing so, whilst the material must produce high piezoelectric strain,
its flexibility must also be considered. Indeed, due to its constant exposure to vibra-
tion, the material is subjected to constant mechanical forces and so its behaviour
with regard to mechanical fatigue is yet another important design criterion.
Thermionic generators consist of a hot cathode and a cold anode, respectively,
called the emitter and the collector. When a heat source is applied to the emitter, a
flow of electrons is generated which move from the emitter to the collector in contact
with a heat sink. Simplistically, thermionic generators can be considered as a diode
that will conduct and produce current in one direction, but only when waste heat
is received. These devices can therefore be considered as thermal engines where the
source of power is the temperature difference between the cathode and the anode
and where the efficiency of generator (𝜂) is always less than:
𝜂< 1 −Ta
Tc
(2.124)
where Ta and Tc are the anode and the cathode temperatures (K), respectively. In
practice however, radiative heat transfer can also take place between the cathode and
anode which reduces the thermionic generation efficiency. In which case, taking
this radiative loss in account, the maximum realisable efficiency of a thermionic
generator (𝜂max) can be obtained from [162]:
𝜂max = jc(ec −ea)
jcec + Prad
= 𝜂carnot∕
(
1 + Prad
jcec
)
(2.125)
𝜂carnot = 1 −ea
ec
(2.126)
where jc is the cathode current density (A/m2), ec and ea are the cathode and anode
potentials (V) and Prad is the dissipated radiation power (W). The losses due to radi-
ation can be difficult to estimate but will never exceed the power loss given by the
Stefan–Boltzmann law from:
Pr ≤𝜀s,c𝜎sbTc
4
(2.127)

176
2 Waste Heat Recovery
where 𝜀s,c is the total emissivity of the cathode surface, 𝜎sb ≈5.67 × 10−8 W/m2 K4 is
the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and Tc the cathode surface temperature (K).
Similar to solar panels, TPV generators rely on the production of electricity from
radiation. So to create the necessary radiation from waste heat, an emitter is neces-
sary which then transforms the temperature gradient into a radiative source for use
by the photovoltaic module to produce electricity. For the design of TPV generators,
radiation theory is used, the exchanged power ̇Q from the emitter to the photovoltaic
cell being given by [163]:
̇Q = ∫

(2.128)
where 𝜆is the radiation wavelength (m), E(𝜆,T) is the spectral blackbody radiated
power (W) from a surface at a temperature T (K), 𝜀s is the surface emissivity, and
Femmiter →PV the view factor between the emitter and the photovoltaic cell, and which
can be obtained from [164, 165]:
Femitter→PV =

where x, y is the width and length of the emitter (m), D is the distance between the
emitter, and the PV cell (m) and the normalised parameters x and y are defined as
follows:
x = x

(2.130)
y = y

(2.131)
In practice, direct electrical conversion devices are not widely used due to their
low efficiencies [6], and this is mainly explained by the numerous energy trans-
formations that involve different loss factors. Furthermore, these systems require
high temperature differences in order to produce a significant quantity of electrical
energy.
2.8.9
Thermal Storage
The design of TES is simpler than many WHR systems because theoretically the
mechanisms are relatively simple – the main challenges are more of a technical
nature of reaching optimal performance by the choice of suitable materials. The
selection requiring compromises between mechanical strength, storage and thermal
properties of the enclosure, the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the heat
exchange media, the operating temperatures and pressures, and the like. And even

2.8 Design Development Methods
177
for the best systems, during any TES process, losses occur during both charging and
discharging phases. As such, the total efficiency 𝜂tot of TES can be considered from
the product of the charging and discharging efficiencies, i.e. as:
𝜂tot = 𝜂charging × 𝜂discharging = Qstored
Qsupplied
× Qdelivered
Qstored
(2.132)
where Qstored is the thermal energy stored during the charging process (kWh),
Qsupplied is the thermal energy supplied to the TES during charging (kWh), and
Qdelivered is the thermal energy recovered from the TES during the discharge process
(kWh). Note that Eq. (2.133) does not consider the internal losses of energy between
the charging and discharging process. Moreover, as electrical energy is used during
the charging and discharging processes, it seems relevant to also include this usage
in the estimation of the TES performances. In which case a COP can be introduced
and defined as [166]:
COP =
Qth,delivered
Qe,charging + Qe,discharging
(2.133)
where Qth,delivered is the thermal energy delivered during the discharge process (kWh),
and Qe,charging and Qe,discharging is the electrical energy provided to the TES during
the charging and discharging operations (kWh). However, since different TES sys-
tems exist, the design method may change accordingly using suitable equations to
describe the heat transfers taking place. In the case of sensible heat storage (widely
used), a fixed mass of heat exchange media such as a liquid is heated by the heat
source and this increases its internal temperature without phase change. In which
case this is simply described as the heating of a fixed mass by the following equation:
Q = mhxmediacp,hxmedia(Tf −Ti)
(2.134)
where Q is the thermal energy provided to the constant mass of heat exchange media
during the heating (J), mhxmedia is the mass of the heat exchange media (kg), cp,hxmedia
its specific heat (J/kg K), and Tf and Ti are the final and initial temperatures of the
heat exchange media during the charging process (K).
With latent heat storage, the energy received by the TES is used to produce a phase
change, and since during the process the temperature of the medium remains con-
stant, the energy stored is related to the system latent heat by:
Q = mhxmediaipc
(2.135)
where mhxmedia is the mass of the heat exchange media (kg) and ipc is the phase
change latent heat (J/kg). For latent heat TES, the phase change transition can be
from solid to liquid or from liquid to vapour. With the introduction of PCMs, it is
now common for latent heat TES to be combined with sensible heat storage and
in such cases, the heat exchange media is typically below the phase change point
when energy is first stored. So the thermal energy is initially used to bring the
heat exchange media to the phase change temperature and then used to operate
the phase change. Once the heat exchange media has changed its phase, sensible

178
2 Waste Heat Recovery
heating within the new phase can also take place. In this case, the energy stored to
the system Q is linked to both the sensible and latent heat transfers by:
Q = mhxmedia ∫
Tpc
Ti
cp,phase1(T)dT + mhxmediaipc + mhxmedia ∫
Tf
Tpc
cp,phase2(T)dT
(2.136)
where mhxmedia, is the mass of the heat exchange media (kg), Ti is the initial temper-
ature of the heat exchange media (K), Tpc is the phase change temperature of the
heat exchange media (K), Tf is the final temperature of the heat exchange media
(K), cp,phase1(T) is the specific heat of the first phase of the heat exchange media
depending on the temperature (J/kg K), cp,phase2 (T) is the specific heat of the sec-
ond phase of the heat exchange media depending on the temperature (J/kg K), and
ipc the phase change latent heat (J/kg). Based on this, for design purposes, the mass
of PCM required for the TES system can be obtained from [167]:
mhxmedia =
Q
∫
Tpc
Ti
cp,phase1(T)dT + ipc + ∫
Tf
Tpc cp,phase2(T)dT
(2.137)
where Q, is the thermal energy given to the TES system during the charging (J). With
the development of computational methods, simulation-based optimisation of TES
are becoming prominent [168], and by considering different scenarios depending on
the climate and operating condition of the system, design choices such as the type of
insulation, the thickness of the PCM, and the heating and cooling demands have all
been studied and optimised. A particular interest for using such simulations is the
possibility of studying and estimating system behaviour over time and so evaluate
its performance whilst embedded into a process.

Low-Temperature Applications
The commonly applied definition of low-temperature applications are those
technologies and processes that operate below 0 ∘C, and common examples are
those that operate in the cryogenic domain and some refrigeration applications.
Of relevance to the technologies of waste heat recovery, such usage is widespread
and is involved in many industrial processes such as the cryogenic preservation
for the food and healthcare industries, the refrigeration of produce, and heating,
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for chiller rooms.
Unlike high-temperature applications, which commonly focus on the efficiency
of burner technology and those technologies that emit high temperature, corrosive,
and particulate-heavy exhaust gases, the cryogenic spectrum of waste heat recov-
ery presents a different set of issues such as a change in material properties, which
can increase brittleness and so lead to subsequent failure of a technology. This then
significantly changes the compatibility of different materials for their application
within this temperature spectrum.
3.1
Refrigeration
The application of refrigeration for commercial refrigerator units used in super-
market has been briefly discussed in Chapter 4. In terms of ‘refrigeration’, the
temperature range is typically defined from 0 to 10 ∘C whereas ‘freezing’ is defined
from –20 ∘C and below, and this identifies a developing region of sub-zero cooling.
The application of this (sub-zero cooling) has been studied, and Liu et al. [1]
discussed the development of sub-zero refrigerators for the preservation of fruit
and vegetables, and the composition of such a system typically consists of multiple
technologies as discussed in Chapter 2. A key part being the addition of heat pumps
and heat exchangers. Wu et al. [2] investigated the role of ammonia in sub-zero
refrigerators and in heat pumps. This work studied ammonia because of its low
freezing point which then eliminates the risk of crystallisation, a potential problem
for the role of refrigeration in which a coolant fluid is typically circulated through a
condenser and absorber to remove heat from each respective process. A schematic
for which is shown in Figure 3.1.

The application of ammonia itself is limited due to handling and safety concerns
which outweigh its benefits as a refrigerant. However, significant studies have been
conducted to improve the properties and offer safer handling of ammonia by intro-
ducing salts, turning the solution into a binary mixture. A similar study also has
been conducted by Singh and Dasgupta [3], who investigated the use of carbon diox-
ide within a refrigeration process in the dairy processing industry, highlighting the
operation of a low-grade waste heat recovery in an existing warm climate, which typ-
ically relies on evaporative cooling to maintain products below a maximum of 4 ∘C.
The proposed system, shown in Figure 3.2, allows the technology to be combined
with ammonia whilst eliminating the role of an evaporative cooler; the operation
allowing the carbon dioxide evaporator side to absorb heat from the ammonia cycle
and the boiler section to heat groundwater at a constant temperature. By utilising the
proposed system, the temperature of the final product remained stable and approxi-
mately 37 kW was recovered, but in addition, 5000 l of water which would have been
used for evaporative cooling was eliminated.
The use of carbon dioxide with heat pumps highlights research into necessary
alternative refrigerants as many are currently being phased out due to their high
global warming potential (GWP), and studies conducted by Polzot et al. [4] investi-
gated the energy benefit of using a carbon dioxide-based heat pump system within
a commercial refrigeration unit as shown within Figure 3.3. The presented system
features a water loop heat pump, where electrical pumps are used to control the ther-
mal zones of the system. The refrigeration cabinet has two operating programmes: a
heating mode and a cooling mode. The heating operation allowing cooled air to pass
through the system instead of water, whilst the cooling scenario is typically activated

when the heat available in the heat pump system is low, so allowing the water tem-
perature to increase, and a dry cooler on the water loop to reject this heat to ambient.
For this study an alternative refrigerant, R1234ZE (E), was employed (reflective of
a commercial unit) and fed through the system at a constant mass flow rate. The
outcome of the study highlighted an improved operation by the use of the CO2 heat
pump system, with approximately 9.4% of energy savings being recovered, and lower
operational costs compared to traditional refrigeration cabinets.

194
3 Low-Temperature Applications
To maximise the efficiency of traditional refrigeration cabinets, the use of binary
heat pump fluids in absorption systems has also been investigated by Salehi and
Yari [5], who investigated ammonia/water, ammonia/sodium thiocyanate, and
ammonia/lithium nitrate within the three different systems shown in Figure 3.4.
These systems involved three test rigs, the first being a conventional heat pump
system (system 1), which featured two compressors, an evaporator, a condenser, a
heat exchanger, and a separation vessel. The liquid leaving the condenser outlet is
passed through a separation vessel, allowing the isolation of vapour and liquid – the
vapour subsequently being passed through a compressor to enter a condenser,
where the heat rejected is transferred through a heat exchanger to provide help
meet the building heating load. In comparison, for system 2 both compressors
are removed, and an absorption section is added where the heat is absorbed by a
refrigeration evaporator. In system 3, both compressors are again removed along
with the separation vessel. The condensed liquid from the condenser splits into
two streams, whereby they enter into the evaporators. The vapour leaving the
first evaporator is then pressurised using the vapour-driven ejector. However, the
vapour from the second evaporator is pressurised using the solution-driven ejector.
Therefore, the condenser supplies the heating load and the second evaporator
supplies the refrigeration load. This enables the solution flowing through the
generator to be heated by any heat source such as solar energy, industrial waste
heat, and others.
The study tested each binary mixture under a set of fixed conditions, with a tradi-
tional system acting as a comparative baseline. The outcome from the study showed
that the mixture of ammonia and water resulted in a low coefficient of performance
(COP) for all three systems, and that both ammonia/sodium thiocyanate and ammo-
nia/lithium nitrate performed equally on system 2. System 3 however showed the
main superiority of ammonia/lithium nitrate in that the fluid recorded a higher COP
and improved evaporator temperatures. The study also reported an average power
generation efficiency of 39.8%, but with the utilisation of ammonia/lithium nitrate,
this value increased by 7.5%.
The use of ammonia was also been investigated by Palm [6], who used ammonia
within low-capacity refrigeration systems. The study primarily focused on the
applicability of ammonia within different heat pump applications and configu-
rations, and made comparisons between ammonia and existing refrigerants. The
system developed by Palm [6] (as shown in Figure 3.5) allows feed water to pass
through the condenser, and then separated, where a small amount of the flow will
pass through a desuperheater, whilst the water exiting the system will return back
into the water distribution system. To ensure correct mixing of the water tank, a
valve was installed within the tank. On the evaporator side of the system, the loop
contains a refrigerant which can be heated. The study was investigated at different
loads ranging from 3.7 to 7.1 kW on the cooling side – the feed water remaining
constant. The outcome of the study highlighted the success of the system noting the
effects of using minute amounts of ammonia in small-scale systems. In addition, the
study also extended the system evaporation temperature range, from −13∘to 2 ∘C.

Similar comparative studies of different refrigerants and heat pumps within a
refrigeration process have also been conducted by Afshari et al. [7]. In this study,
R134a, R407c, R22 and R404a were each investigated in two modes of operation, and
Figure 3.6 shows the two operating modes used. Figure 3.6a highlights including
the heat pump and Figure 3.6b highlighting the operation with a freezer. The system
operates on a constant airflow which acts as the heat source and water as the heat

sink (secondary fluid), and the system also features a reciprocating compressor to
recirculate the refrigerant. In comparison between the two modes of operation, the
heat pump exhibits stable steady-state performance in terms of power consumption
and evaporator temperature, unlike the freezer which showed a variable evaporator
temperature.
The application of waste heat technologies within the low-temperature domain
is not limited to traditional heat exchangers and heat pump networks, thermoelec-
tric generators (TEGs) has also been applied within the refrigeration field but on a
smaller scale. For example, Rodríguez et al. [8] investigated the role of TEG modules
within ice makers, as shown in Figure 3.7. The operation allows absorption from the
cold side of a Peltier module, which then cools and freezes the water in contact with
it – ice forming on aluminium trays which are in contact with the cold side of the
module. In testing, the ice production increased by 84% when 2 V was applied to the
module
Similarly, a study conducted by Söylemez et al. [9] investigated the application of
a TEG module within a domestic refrigerator as shown in Figure 3.8. The system
consisted of a Peltier module sandwiched between two heat exchangers, and the
study considered the addition of simulated food blocks and how they cooled. The
outcome demonstrated not only a significantly faster chilling process but also lower
temperature limit was reached compared to traditional refrigeration units.

To improve the efficiency and application of TEG modules, Min and Rowe [10]
developed multiple prototype TEG refrigerators. The outcome of their study noted
that although TEG units were easily able to maintain a temperature of 5 ∘C, their
electrical consumption, in comparison to traditional refrigerators, was 30% higher
and gave rise to significantly larger maintenance costs.
3.2
Cryogenics
The development of low-temperature and cryogenic heat pipes has been investi-
gated, with multiple working fluids and operations being considered from both
experimental and computational perspectives. For example, Long and Zhang [11]
looked into the operation of a cryogenic thermosyphon at different fill ratios and
inclinations. The system comprised a single copper thermosyphon charged with
nitrogen, fed from a reservoir tank filled with liquid nitrogen, the thermosyphon
and reservoir then being linked by a condenser section. To simulate a heat load,
the evaporator was attached to a heating wire. The test exposed a problem. The
lack of controls to normalise the evaporator temperature resulted in a consistent
fluctuation, resulting in constant on and off operation, leading to an unsteady heat
transfer rate and hence fluctuating condenser temperatures. So when the filling

3.2 Cryogenics
199
ratio was increased, the increasingly unsteady evaporator temperatures led to a
drying out of the thermosyphon at the higher filling ratios.
The authors also developed a system of a single heat pipe charged with liquid
helium encased with a copper shell [12]. Similar to the nitrogen-charged heat pipe,
the evaporator also contained a heated wire to simulate its heat load. The condenser
system further contained a cryocooler to act as a heat sink. Unlike the nitrogen con-
figuration, the system contained two radiation shields to minimise radiative effects,
and the initial tests highlighted a minimum radiative effect of 1 W during start up.
The authors also developed a relationship between the filling ratio and the risk of
drying out, with drying out occurring at 0.7 W and a 100% filling ratio.
As others have shown, helium is an optimum working fluid, and is often used to
create conditions close to absolute zero with cryogenic heat pipes and cooling sys-
tems being applied at CERN for the cooling of particle colliders. The loop is cooled
by liquid helium, but its storage and containment are extremely difficult, hence
using helium within a thermosyphon could be problematic owing to such leakages,
thereby altering the filling ratio. In respect of other cryogenic fluids, liquid nitro-
gen has been investigated by Bolozdynya et al. [13], and again the basis of their test
was a copper thermosyphon with an electrical heater wire applied to the evaporator,
the condenser heat sink comprising a liquid nitrogen-cooled head. The test consid-
ered the filling ratio and its effect on the subsequent cooling rate with the addition
of a heat load, and displayed a poor cooling rate of 0.6 K/min with a filling ratio of
32%, but with a smaller filling ratio of 6.5% the test showed a cooling rate at 3 K/min
(under identical conditions).
3.2.1
Loop Heat Pipe
A loop heat pipe (LHP) is based on a closed loop circuit containing both liquid and
vapour phases simultaneously. The operation begins with a compensation chamber
which contains the working fluid and a wick structure to ensure that there is always
working fluid within the fluid chamber of the heat pipe. A section of the LHP lead-
ing from the compensation chamber houses an evaporator section, where the heat
input is supplied. The vapour then travels through the adiabatic section of the LHP
to the condenser section where it is transformed back into liquid, before finally trav-
elling back to the fluid chamber. Loop heat pipes are widely applied to cryogenic
systems, and Bai et al. [14] investigated cryogenic LHPs charged with nitrogen for
the cooling of space exploration devices. The heat pipe employs the same principle
(as shown in Figure 3.9), with the addition of secondary auxiliary loops – these sec-
ondary loops contain additional evaporator and condenser sections to initiate super-
critical operation. In the study, an electrical heater was used to supply the thermal
load to both the auxiliary evaporator and the main evaporator. Other, similar appli-
cations for space technologies have used LHPs. For example, Guo et al. [16] inves-
tigated a methane-based cryogenic LHP for thermal regulation within an infrared
detection system, which was tested to study conditions such as the performance
under supercritical conditions and its heat transport capacity. The research intro-
duced an innovative compact system with an integrated wick structure within both

evaporator and compensation chambers, thereby eliminating the risk of dry out. The
condenser consists of a primary and secondary coil wrapped around a cryocooler
acting as a heat sink. The research’s aim was to study supercritical heat pipe opera-
tion at ambient temperatures, and although successful during start-up, allowing the
evaporator to drop the operating range of the working fluid, once the auxiliary heat
load was reduced to 1 W in the cycling process the system failed to detect the heat
load due to parasitic heat load from the surroundings.
Multiple studies on cryogenic LHPs have noted their potential to dry out and their
failure to reach supercritical operation during start up, but in addition, the impor-
tance of selecting the correct working fluid. Yan et al. [15] studied various fluids to
determine an optimum for cryogenic LHPs, and their initial tests were conducted
using liquid nitrogen at different filling ratios and filling pressures. The system con-
tains both a primary and a secondary evaporation loop – where the secondary evap-
orator loop is connected to a reservoir tank. With traditional closed LHPs, one of
the main problems is the difficulty in maintaining a constant level of working fluid
within the compensation chamber, so the study suggested an improvement of intro-
ducing another chamber to mitigate dry out and heat pipe failure and the second
loop reducing the risk of failure during supercritical conditions. In this way, the
secondary loop circulates fluid through the system whilst the evaporator reaches
a suitable operating range for the working fluid. The relationship between the sec-
ondary loop and the filling ratio was widely considered within the study, and because
of the improved circulation of fluid, it was found that the need for excess fluid only
hindered the heat pipe performance, leading to an increase in saturation pressure;
in as much as, the change in fill pressure (with constant fill ratio), highlighted an
increase in saturation pressure, which led to an increase in resistance and a decrease
in heat pipe performance.
Another variant is the pulsating heat pipe (PHP) that embodies a closed loop cir-
cuit, but one which relies on variations in both vapour bubbles and liquid slugs
within the system, the temperature and pressure differentials between the evapo-
rator and condenser sections creating a pulsating motion, allowing a liquid slug to
pass through the system as shown in Figure 3.10.

The system typically operates without a wick, making it a viable option for cryo-
genic heat pipes, but the system performance is highly dependent on the number
of turns. Liang et al. [17] investigated the performance of an oscillating heat pipe
charged with neon as the working fluid. The system operated from room temper-
ature to the critical point of the working fluid and was designed to investigate the
cool down period of the heat pipe. A heat load was applied to the evaporator and
a cooling plate was fixed to the condenser section. The system showed that its per-
formance was dependent on the rate of liquid neon entering the system because the
cooling rate took nine hours from 223 to 31 K. It is worth noting that the system
experienced significant pressure changes – indicating dry out – which also occurred
in other PHPs when charged with a cryogenic fluid. For example, the effects of dry
out were also experienced by Xu et al. [18] in their study to investigate the operation
of a PHP charged with liquid nitrogen. The evaporator section was connected to a
heating wire wrapped around the breadth of the system and the electrical input to
the heater was increased accordingly to observe the thermal performance. The PHP
was charged with liquid nitrogen, but increases in evaporator temperature led to the
dry out of the PHP. Xu et al. [18] investigated a PHP charged with helium for ultra-
fast cooling applications, in which a cryocooler was attached to the condenser and
a heater wire was used for the evaporator to apply the heat load to the system. Prior
to operation, a pre-cool function was applied to allow the PHP to reach the desired
operating temperature, the helium PHP then allowed the cooling down from room
temperature to 7 K in eight hours. Initially the configuration was aligned vertically
and highlighted the effect of gravity, allowing the fluid to reach the evaporative sys-
tem and surpass the operating temperature. However, when the test was repeated
horizontally, no major impact was noted. Other variations and configurations do,
nonetheless, play a key role in the operation, with the number of turns increasing
the resistance of the system, and Barrak et al. [19] investigated different variations
of PHPs with a selection of working fluids. The study involved six PHPs charged

with butane and refrigerant R134a. A heater was applied through the evaporator
section, with a coolant stream passing through the condenser. The location of the
heater and cooler varied with a single or double contact with a variable power sup-
ply and the six PHPs were tested with both contact positions and electrical loads. The
results demonstrated an improved performance for a double contact evaporator with
an increasing power input. Similarly, the effects of horizontal and vertical positions
were investigated along with the effects of thermal resistance, and for this research,
the results reflected an improved and more reliable vertical operation against the
horizontal, over repeated results.
Unlike cryogenic heat pipes, which are mainly limited to research applications,
heat pumps are critical in the role of gas separation, and Fu and Gundersun [20]
defined the role of vapour recompression heat pumps within the air separation pro-
cess. The basic operation of the distillation process allows air to be drawn into a
column, and nitrogen and oxygen are separated into their distinct forms; both gases
then being processed to liquify in a reboiler, compressor, and a condenser com-
bination. In a traditional system, a significant amount of heat loss occurs within
the processing of impurities and compression, with an estimated 40% of heat being
wasted to ambient. As an improvement, Figure 3.11 highlights an optimised liquifi-
cation unit, the air entering the distillation cycle, where the flow is compressed and
purified. The gas is then subcooled to its dew point (within a heat exchanger) and is
then passed to a distillation column where it is cooled and expanded. This method
also allows both gas streams to pass through a heat exchanger to liquify their impu-
rities, which can be handled in a separate process (dashed line). The streams leaving
the heat exchangers are further purified and cooled until both gases are liquefied.
This proposed operation allows nitrogen to be used as a refrigerant with the heat
pump, the outcome of this producing a 5% saving in energy consumption.

Considerations regarding impurities and vented nitrogen has also been studied
to maximise the utilisation of the wasted thermal energy, and a study conducted
by Weng et al. [21] investigated the applicability of TEG modules for cold recovery
from vented cryogenic gases. The schematic highlighted in Figure 3.12 shows the
installation of a TEG cold recovery unit on the outlet of a liquid nitrogen tank
whilst in operation. As the tank separates liquid nitrogen from gaseous nitrogen,
the gaseous phase is vented and passes through a TEG module to recover some cold
energy. The outcome of the study showing a recovery of 0.93 W when the outlet flow
was 3.7 g/s.
The utilisation of cold energy has also been investigated by Ge et al. [22], their
research included the development of a cold storage method as shown in Figure 3.13.
The unit is installed at the outlet of the tank where it is primarily gaseous nitro-
gen – the operation being similar to the study conducted by Weng et al. [21], but
with one key difference – the introduction of a pre-cooling tank which contains
the liquid nitrogen to ensure that liquid reaches the TEG module, the gas being
re-liquified (if necessary) before passing to the TEG module. The study was con-
ducted at various flow rates ranging from 40 to 100 l/min at a constant pressure and
ambient temperature, and the outcome of the study showed that the addition of a
TEG for this application only produced an efficiency of 0.03−0.035%, with only 20 W
being recovered.

HVAC
The application possibilities of waste heat recovery technologies within the
ventilation industry are vast, with multiple opportunities to combine technologies
to optimise the amount of waste heat recovered from various buildings forms,
ranging from residential homes to hospitals and office blocks.
One such example is the application of waste heat recovery technologies by
Sukarno et al. [23], who investigated the role of heat pipe heat exchangers (HPHE)
to reduce energy consumption and mitigate the spread of infectious disease for
a hospital HVAC systems. The proposed system, shown in Figure 3.14, allows
infectious air to be drawn from the room and act as a heat sink. At the same time,

the evaporator section allows cooler clean air to be heated and reintroduced into
the room. The system was tested to determine its energy efficiency at various inlet
velocities, the outcome of the study highlighting heat recoveries ranging from 82 to
767 W depending on the inlet velocity.
The use of heat pipes has also been investigated by Jouhara and Meskimmon [24]
and Jouhara and Ezzudin [25], the developed systems involved the utilisation of
a wraparound loop heat pipe (WLHP), used in combination with a cooling coil as
shown in Figure 3.15. The principle behind the system reverses the temperature dif-
ference across the heat pipe, which then contributes towards the dehumidification
process and maximises the potential of the cooling coil, allowing the WLHP to act
as a precooler for incoming air.
The use of heat exchangers has also been investigated by Eidan et al. [26] to
compare the performance of HPHEs as a dehumidification process in subtropical
climates. The study involved the development of a climate-controlled chamber to
maintain a constant operating condition for the installed HVAC system as shown
in Figure 3.15. The tests involved the gradual increase in relative humidity ranging
from 15% to 100%, the outcome from the study highlighting a significant decrease in

the dehumidification process as a result of utilising a cooling coil with pre-cooling
from a HPHE (Figure 3.16).
Heat pumps also play a significant role in the development of HVAC systems to
maximise all available heat sources from unconventional locations. For instance,
a study conducted by Lyu et al. [27] developed HVAC system utilising geothermal
energy. The plant involves the addition of a heat pump and an air-to-water heat
exchanger to heat clean incoming air, but with additional channels to allow for
pipes to be embedded within the walls. When the unit is cooling, the water from
the condenser section of the heat pump can be circulated through these pipes to
cool and remove heat stored in the walls. Conversely, when the unit is in its heat-
ing mode, the evaporator section from the heat pump can introduce warm water
throughout the pipe-embedded walls. Studied under ambient conditions, the system
showed significant energy savings of approximately 29%, and reduced the reliance
on air-conditioning by 34% (Figure 3.17).
Similar work on utilising geothermal energy was also investigated by Magraner
et al. [28], where a coupled geothermal heat pump system was developed in transient
system simulation tool (TRNSYS) as shown in Figure 3.18. The network consists
of a reversible water-to-water heat pump (optimised using a blend of propane and
refrigerant) and a borehole heat exchanger. The heat pump operates in heating and
cooling modes by (respectively) absorbing heat from the ground or rejecting heat into
it, and the performance was studied for a series of estimations regarding occupancy
and weather for a building complying with current building regulations – the out-
come from all of which showed an improved energy performance of 15% compared
to a generic house.
The application of geothermal hybrid systems has also been considered by Villar-
ino et al. [29], for use within a multi-storey office building in Spain. The schematic,

shown in Figure 3.19, consists of a borehole heat exchanger connected to a heat
pump (which will allow for heating and cooling modes) feeding a radiant floor sys-
tem. The system was tested in summer conditions in July for one week, and the
results indicated that the geothermal heat pump system could provide a room tem-
perature of 21.7 ∘C in cooling mode and 24.8 ∘C in heating mode.
By way of performance improvement and to maximise the available waste heat
potential, the application of phase change material (PCM) to HVAC systems
has also been investigated. For example, Maccarini et al. [30] investigated the
application of a PCM heat exchanger combined with a reversible air-to-water pump
in a commercial building. Traditionally, PCM heat exchanger systems function by
allowing simultaneous heating and cooling via a two-way loop, in which water
is fed into the system and kept at a constant of 22 ∘C throughout all zones in
the building regardless of their individual heating or cooling requirements. The
advantage of the system presented within this study highlights the potential for
waste heat to be transferred to cooler zones, so reducing the building’s reliance
on its heating system(s). In addition, the use of the PCM allows for heat to be
stored and discharged to a cold-water source in the evening, and by such operation,
saved approximately 6.3 kWh/m2 compared to a traditional configuration. As a
further application, PCM’s have also been studied in the form of PCM integrated
walls, one such study conducted by Kishore et al. [31], investigated the potential
of the technology within different climates within the United States (US). The
schematic highlighted in Figure 3.20 shows a cross section of the proposed PCM
integrated walls, the principle behind this being the charging of the PCM during
daylight hours, and discharging during the evening. The investigation of the PCM
showed that during the peak summer months, the PCM was 100% melted, hence
highlighting that the PCM was not functional during these times. However, during
cooler months the PCM showed a significant but varied heat gain across all five
locations. Locations based on desert climates showed minimal heat gain values of
under 4% but mountainous regions registered a heat gain of 47%.

A similar study was conducted by Li et al. [32], who also investigated thin
PCM-reinforced walls in a multitude of climate zones within the US ranging from
deserts to high-altitude regions. Similar to the study conducted by Kishore et al.
[31], the developed schematic shown in Figure 3.21 also features a thinner PCM
sandwiched between layers of insulation.
The study investigated the thickness of the PCM throughout the different zones
and months, and the study indicated that increasing the PCM layer to 15 mm also
increased the building efficiency (due to the increased thermal storage capacity)
without altering the melt point. In addition, the study showed that when the PCM
was applied in hot climates and deserts – where the temperature exceeds 30 ∘C – the
charging of the PCM was able to maintain comfortable room temperatures.

Medium-Temperature Applications
A significant amount of our daily essentials is reliant on industrial processes – from
the food we buy in supermarkets to the cars we drive, but this also results in an
increase in fossil fuel dependency and an increase in the emissions generated. Often
on an industrial scale, these generated emissions contain harmful greenhouse
gases and valuable waste heat – which has the potential to be applied in other
processes. The multiple technologies mentioned in Chapter 2 reflect the potential
for waste heat recovery and the associated reduction in emissions and economic
benefits. This chapter reflects the application of waste heat technologies in the
medium-temperature range (0–400 ∘C).
4.1
Food Industry
Energy efficiency in the food-processing sector is becoming an increasingly impor-
tant concern. Because not only are the costs of both electricity and fossil fuel
resources dramatically increasing, we also have the challenging targets for lowering
greenhouse gas emissions (as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008), and so waste
heat recovery is essential in improving industrial energy efficiency. The estimated
recoverable heat that is lost annually in the United Kingdom alone is 11.4 TWh, of
which a quarter comes from the food- and beverage-processing industry. Utilisation
of this heat, which can be described as a green, carbon-neutral energy source may
therefore be used to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and so increase the cost-effectiveness of a process.
Table 4.1 indicates the best-case theoretical scenarios in which all of the available
waste heat is recovered to replace heating duties traditionally provided by natu-
ral gas.
4.1.1
Energy Use in the Industry
As mentioned earlier, this sector accounts for around 25% of industrial energy usage
within the United Kingdom, around 42 TWh/year, and this energy usage can be
broken down according to various processes as shown Figure 4.1. From this figure,
we can see that energy use (within the industry) is dominated by low-temperature

(used to regulate the temperature of the combustion chamber) are all burnt within
the combustion chamber at a temperature of about 472 ∘C. After combustion, the
hot waste stream from the combustion chamber flows into the heat exchanger
where it is used to heat the cooking oil from 154 to 170.2 ∘C.
In certain industrial facilities, once the waste stream is discharged from the heat
exchanger part of it is filtered back to the combustion chamber [3], whilst the
remainder is emitted to the atmosphere via an exhaust pipe. However, in other
processing facilities, the waste stream is directly emitted into the atmosphere
without any waste heat recovery/recycling methods being employed at all, and
since crisp production requires huge amounts of energy, it might be presumed that
utilisation of waste heat during the production process would be of the greatest
priority; especially as there are multiple waste heat recovery possibilities from the
fryer section of the crisps manufacturing plant. For example:
●Using the waste heat from the foul gas exiting the fryer to drive an organic Rankine
cycle (ORC) system for power generation – In the crisps manufacturing process,
the foul gas from the fryer is mostly hot vapourised cooking oil at a temperature of
about 120 ∘C with a mass flow rate of about 3.172 kg/s and mass fraction of 0.606
of H2O(g), 0.299 of N2, 0.095 of O2, and negligible CO2
●Using the waste heat from the waste gas stream from the heat exchanger to drive an
ORC system for power generation – The waste stream from the heat exchanger to
the exhaust stack is at a temperature of approximately 164 ∘C, with an approximate
mass flow rate of 10.509 kg/s with mass fraction of 0.411 of H2O(g), 0.050 of CO2,
0.506 of N2 and 0.033 of O2.
4.1.3
Case Study 2: Temperature and Energy Performance of Open
Refrigerated Display Cabinets Using Heat Pipe Shelves
One of the biggest users of electricity in the United Kingdom are the supermarket
food stores. Based on the distribution area of the store, the trading procedures,
the shop layout, the shopping operation, and the equipment used in the store
to conserve and show food items, their energy usage is measured at about
2000 kWh/m2/year [4]; although we need to be aware that cooling systems
only consume about half of this energy, the other support facilities, such as the
air-conditioning, utilise the remainder.
Vertical open-style display cabinets are the most popular type of refrigerators and
are found in supermarkets and department stores worldwide. These feature a recir-
culating air barrier – which acts as an aero-thermodynamic barrier between the cab-
inet interior and the outside world – but also enables food items to be seen without
physical restriction. In a typical cabinet configuration, the heat circulation between
foodstuffs and shelves is comparatively limited, which means that food items will
cool inefficiently in places where the products need to have a heavy interaction with
the shelves. Furthermore, during any defrost periods, they also exhibit large temper-
ature fluctuations and major temperature rises.

216
4 Medium-Temperature Applications
In compliance with ISO 23953-2:2015, the UK government specifies that all food
items shall be stored at a temperature below 5 ∘C [5], but unfortunately, current
cabinet prototypes seem incapable of holding minimum temperatures without
inducing localised freezing in the cabinet. Public Group surveys have found that
70% of foodstuffs in supermarket display cabinets are kept at temperatures above
8 ∘C, while 60% of items are kept at or above 10 ∘C [6]. It is therefore essential to
revisit these refrigeration systems.
Refrigeration functions by preventing or at least retarding deterioration, spoilage,
and development of bacteria within a product. Hence, the overall objective of any
cooling system is not just to maintain the acceptability of food goods, but also (in
regards to the colour, smell, taste, and vitamins content) to maintain food items at
their highest quality, because any observable changes in these variables reduces a
product’s consumer value and so contributes to economic loss.
In several industries, heat pipe-based heat exchangers are used as heat recovery
and energy-saving devices [7, 8] and because of the high concentrations of heat they
can transfer even with relatively small temperature gradients, heat pipes are also
sometimes known as thermal superconductors. In their basic form, heat pipes are
referred to as ‘thermosiphons’, and their work depends on gravity, where heat is
transmitted only from the lower end of the pipe to the higher end. A heat pipe is a
hermetically sealed tube partially filled with a small amount of working fluid, which
then exists in both the liquid and the vapour phases, and is key to its operation. At
the higher temperature ‘evaporator’ section of the heat pipe, the contained working
fluid in the liquid phase evaporates and flows at high speed into the cooler end of the
pipe. This vapour then condenses (within the ‘condenser’ section) and gives up its
heat. Finally, by gravitational effect, the liquid operating fluid returns to the vessel’s
evaporator.
A series of straight heat pipes may be viewed therefore as a heat recovery unit
connected to form one system – where high thermal conductivity, passive and reli-
able operation, consistent temperature distribution, affordable costs, and no con-
ventional external pumping systems exchangers – are all to its advantage. Relevant
to such an application, Jouhara et al. [9] have developed a novel technology that
incorporates an actively cooled heat pipe-based refrigerator shelf, the shelves being
designed so that food items can be placed on the upper surface of the flat heat pipe
which are made from aluminium materials filed with their working fluid of ammo-
nia (NH3). Figure 4.2 illustrates the structure of the heat pipe-based refrigerator
shelf.
This novel adaption of heat pipes to shelving integrates three additional heat
transfer processes into the current cooling system, (as can be seen from Figure 4.3):
(i) heat transfer due to conduction from the top surface of the heat pipe from food
items positioned on it, (ii) heat transfer by natural convection between the food
and the base surface of a second shelf placed directly above the food, and (iii) heat
transfer due to radiation which helps transfer heat from the warmer food items to
the colder surfaces of the heat pipe shelves.
Case studies employed two identical merchandised open display cabinets for the
purpose of experimental analysis and comparison. One case was equipped with its

standard shelving whilst the second was fitted with the advanced actively cooled
shelf, but both cabinets were then sited inside an environmental-controlled research
chamber. The position of the products and the estimated shelf life for each product
used in the tests are shown in Figure 4.4.
The data acquisition (DAQ) system was linked to a total of 28 k-type thermocou-
ples for quantifying and tracking the primary temperatures of the products, the tradi-
tional shelf and the actively cooled shelf surface temperatures, the cabin back panel
temperature, and the ambient air temperature, and in order to record the energy
usage for the cabinets and the temperature of the food products, experiments were
carried out for 24 hours. As illustrated in Figure 4.5, products in the front row of the
shelves were directly measured with thermocouples. For products in touch with the

on the top of each product column (as seen in Figure 4.5), they were measured by
thermocouples placed in the following positions: (i) on top of each product’s column,
(ii) in contact with the shelf, (iii) in the back row, (iv) in the front row.
Table 4.2 shows the reflective results for the purpose of demonstrating the tem-
perature distributions for the experiment. Dependent on their location within the
cabinet, the lowest and highest temperatures of all food items were recorded. With
the exception of the food items located on the top shelf of the system, most other food
items located on a heat pipe shelf demonstrated lower core temperatures compared
to their equivalent product sited on a traditional shelf. Furthermore, it was noted
that for the heat pipe shelves, food items in positions B and D, i.e. those in direct
contact with the shelf, experienced the lowest temperatures. However, and unex-
pectedly, the food items located in point D for the middle and bottom traditional
shelves were subject to hot spots – which were not anticipated.
It can be seen that the average core temperatures of the products placed on the top
heat pipe shelf fluctuate less compared to the same products on traditional shelving,
but also, the tests showed that for conventional shelves, the lowest core temperatures
occurred with back-row products (positions A and B).
Overall, the experimental findings indicated that heat pipe shelves were able to
obtain a more consistent temperature distribution both along the shelves and across
the refrigerator, and a more incremental cooling profile. In addition, the heat pipe
shelves produced lower temperature gradients between the various product loca-
tions inside the cabinet compared to traditional shelves. The average daily electrical
power usage of the cabinet fitted with heat pipe shelves was about 7.6 kWh, whereas
the sufficient electrical power consumption for the traditional configuration was
higher by 1 kWh per day (8.6 kWh). Finally, the cabinet fitted with the heat pipe
shelves showed an overall energy saving of 12%, which translates to an economic
benefit of almost £44 per cabinet per year.

4.2 Ventilation
221
4.2
Ventilation
Heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are air-to-air heat exchangers that perform effec-
tive waste heat recovery in domestic, commercial, and industrial applications. In
this way, pre-conditioning of the incoming air supply to a building delivers a heat-
ing benefit by using the otherwise wasted temperature gradient between air supply
and exhaust.
It is widely recognised that HRVs are therefore effective in saving energy whilst
preserving the required rates of ventilation, and the sort of HRVs that reuse expelled
indoor heat have been very successfully used in buildings and for which, a number
of studies have been undertaken to investigate the effect of heat recovery systems on
energy building efficiency.
Studies have demonstrated that the use of HRVs can save energy for heating pur-
poses. However, additional cooling energy is required to deal with high outdoor
temperatures in summer. Beneficially though, other experiments have shown that
HRVs capable of transferring both latent and sensible heat have effectively decreased
both heating and cooling energy together.
Energy invested in maintaining heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
systems amounts to roughly 60% of global overall building energy consumption, and
this segment will only increase with population growth and prosperity, hence the
development and deployment of cost-effective innovations that increase the perfor-
mance of HVAC, including specific waste heat recovery methods, continues to be
pursued.
By way of example, the US Department of Energy published a review stating that
the energy usage of buildings could be decreased by up to 50% by the use of currently
available energy recovery/management technology, but it also further suggested that
advanced waste heat recovery/ventilation technology would substantially reduce the
energy required to condition ventilation air by utilising the frequently ignored tem-
perature potentials between cold/hot air streams in HVAC duct systems. This tem-
perature resource could, for example, push heat transfer by air-to-air heat exchang-
ers, thereby facilitating pre-cooling and/or pre-heating of air to minimise the power
requirement for air-conditioning (AC) and heating units.
4.2.1
Applications
Researchers have recently made significant and important advances in waste heat
recovery for ventilation technologies by investigating the properties, architecture,
construction, and thermal efficiency of heat pipes. Conventional heat pipe (CHP)
technologies have been developed for use of low-temperature sources (15–55 ∘C),
and Noie-Baghban and Majideian [1] investigated the recovery of waste heat using
CHPs for surgery rooms in hospitals. The study showed that the efficacy of CHP was
16%, but it relied on the diameter and the fin difference and so the heat quality is lim-
ited since the CHP has been configured for low-temperature operating conditions.
Another investigation [10] implemented CHPs for heat recovery between two
sources of fresh air and the return air in an AC facility where the incoming fresh air

222
4 Medium-Temperature Applications
was to be cooled. To confirm the heat transfer and the temperature shift of the fresh
air, the ratios of the mass flow rate between the return and fresh air were examined.
During the experiments, the temperature of the fresh air inlet was monitored
between 32 and 40 ∘C, while the temperature of the inlet return air was maintained
at approximately 26 ∘C.
Martínez et al. [2] designed a mixed-energy recovery system consisting of two
CHPs and indirect evaporative regenerators for AC and using experimental mod-
elling approaches, the energy characterisation of the mixed-energy recovery mech-
anism was carried out. The key finding was that part of the energy from the return
airflow could be extracted by adding a mixed-energy recovery system to AC instal-
lations consisting of two CHPs and indirect evaporative systems, thereby increasing
energy efficiency, and reducing the environmental effects.
Lukitobudi et al. [3] developed, fabricated, and fully tested a two-phase closed
thermosyphon (TPCT) heat exchanger for medium-temperature heat recovery in
bakeries for TPCT applications. The TPCT had efficiency of 65%, although the
authors commented that the TPCT could be harmed by the overload pressure
during the processes. By recovering the heat from the exhaust gas of the engine,
Yang et al. [9] analysed the potential use of TPCT for passengers on a large bus. The
study determined that TPCTs can be used efficiently as a heat recovery system, and
the findings of the tests agree well with the numerical results.
The efficacy of the TPCT heat exchangers for naturally ventilated buildings was
investigated [4, 5], and in this investigation, a two-zone chamber with a horizontal
partition examined the efficiency of three types of TPCT heat recovery units. These
heat recovery units were just three of a set of seven externally finned heat pipes, but
included firstly, a TPCT heat exchanger, a second with cylindrical spine fins, and a
third consisting of two rows of spaced TPCTs. For the pressure loss characteristics
of the systems, a CFD simulation was used. According to experimental findings, the
performance of the TPCT heat recovery units was greatly affected by the air velocity,
but potentially the heat recovery was 16% to 17% more effective for the same speed,
using two TPCT banks with simple fins instead of using one bank.
The predictive pressure loss coefficient for a two-row, parallel configuration of
six pipes was 3.3 compared to 4.2 for the staggered pipes and 3.7 for seven smaller
parallel TPCTs, all based on the CFD modelling findings at a velocity of 1 m/s. The
study proposed that any planned mean air velocity should be less than 1 m/s in nat-
urally ventilated low-rise buildings without the impact of wind. This style of heat
exchanger can be an innovative substitute for traditional reheat coils, leading to
energy savings and improving the cooling capacity of cooling coils with limited or
no external energy being necessary.
For the applications of an oscillating heat pipe (OHP) as a heat exchanger,
Rittidech et al. [5] used the air preheater of the closed-end oscillating heat pipe
(CEOHP) for a drying process. The system used, attached the condenser section to
the fresh-air section and the evaporator section was in contact with the gas burner
heat source. The dryer bath chosen configuration being ideal for the CEOHP air
preheater. The heat transfer rate and efficiency were calculated and compared to

4.3 Solar Energy

the expected values. The study showed that energy can be saved by using a CEOHP
heat exchanger for pre-heating air as part of a drying system.
4.3
Solar Energy
In spite of extensive research conducted in improving the functionality of pho-
tovoltaic (PV) solar systems, there is still much resistance when it comes to the
application of this technology due to the limitations offered by the solar conversion
efficiency. In this regard, many studies have been performed which encouraged
the development of different technologies to improve the utilisation efficiency of
solar energy. Particularly, the effect of temperature, and the generation of waste
heat and overheating are noted as major problems associated with significant
efficiency reduction and the poor usability of photovoltaic modules. To put this into
context, the efficiency of photovoltaic cells can drop by nearly 0.5% as the surface
temperature rises by every 1 ∘C above the normal operating condition, and this
value can affect the overall productivity of a system by a large margin, especially
since the efficiency of PV modules typically range from 10% to 20% [6].
This has therefore resulted in many studies which investigated different technolo-
gies and systems to absorb and recover the waste heat from solar modules. Employ-
ing a waste heat recovery system can bring several advantages to the system in terms
of output efficiency improvement and generation of thermal energy, and the waste
heat recovery technologies used for solar application are, in the main, based on pas-
sive or active techniques. Active techniques usually require energy from an external
source to function, whereas passive technologies do not need an input from other
components and operate as a stand-alone system.
For example, Kabeel et al. [7] investigated the viability of cooling photovoltaics
panels in the hot Egyptian climate and discovered that by using a water-cooling tech-
nique, nearly 10 Wh/day of waste heat could be absorbed. In this same study, other
methods for cooling the panels such as forced air were also examined. However, the
technique that included water as cooling medium was shown to deliver the greatest
amount of energy gain. Niztic et al. [8] used water as the cooling fluid and sprayed
this medium both over and under the surface of the panel to absorb generated waste
heat. The experiment, which was tested in a Mediterranean climate, showed that
the electrical power output can increase by more than 16% from a reduction in the
overall panel temperature of nearly 30 ∘C.
Alternatively, and as shown by Golzari et al. [11], the thermal efficiency of a PV/T
system can also be increased by an electro-hydrodynamic single pass air-cooled tech-
nique, and the results noted that the thermal efficiency of the panel was increased
by nearly 29% when the generated waste heat was absorbed and dissipated through
secondary flows and vortices of the developed winds. Pang et al. [12] examined the
performance of a PV/T system and discovered that by increasing the water mass
flow rate through the panels, the absorption of the waste from the system can be
increased. The experiment was conducted for water at different mass flow rates and

224
4 Medium-Temperature Applications
demonstrated that the electrical and thermal efficiency of the system were in the
range of 11% and 57%, respectively.
A multi-concept cooling technique was proposed by Idoko et al. [13], where dif-
ferent water, air, and conductive cooling methods were combined with each other to
passively absorb the waste heat from photovoltaic panels. The experiment involved
mounting the panels in a configuration at a height to facilitate natural air cooling,
whilst, at the same time, allowing water to flow through the surface. The panels
were also attached to aluminium fins which acted as a heat sink and cool water was
supplied in the form of blocks of ice. The study, based on the combination of the
mentioned methods, showed nearly 20 W increase in power output from their sys-
tem, which corresponds to almost 5% in output efficiency improvement. The use of
fins was also examined by Elbreki et al. [14], who tried to dissipate the waste heat
from the panels using lapping fins and planer reflectors. The results demonstrated,
that by using a specific fin configuration, slight electrical efficiency improvements
of almost 2% can be achieved and that the technique, although passive, can still help
in reducing the overall temperature of the module. Figure 4.6 shows the lapping fins
and planar reflector arrangement developed by Elbreki et al. [14].
Having considered the mentioned passive technologies, it should be noted that
other techniques, such as the use of phase change or phase change materials (PCMs),
are also viable solutions to absorb and dissipate the waste heat from the panels to
improve the system output efficiencies. For instance, Hasan et al. [15] studied the
effect of PCMs on reducing a photovoltaics module temperature and used two dif-
ferent variations of PCMs – namely a salt hydrate and a eutectic mixture. The results
from the experiments indicated that both materials were successful in reducing the
temperature of the photovoltaics modules. However, the salt hydrate was shown to
provide better performance and achieved nearly 4% increase in power output and
almost 3% higher temperature drop compared to the second PCM – the eutectic
mixture of fatty and capric palmitic acid. The investigation nevertheless concluded
that the PCMs used have better functionality in locations where the solar radiation
absorption is more stable, and the temperature are higher.

A similar study was performed by Hachem et al. [16] where white petroleum
jelly, pure PCM, and a mixture in the form of white petroleum jelly combined with
graphite and copper was used to provide thermal management for a photovoltaics
panel. The experimental results showed that the temperature of the cells can be
reduced using all of the mentioned materials, however, the PCM mixture provided
the highest amount of cooling and increased the efficiency of the panel by almost
6%. Salem et al. [17] performed an experiment using a PCM mixture comprising
a number of nanoparticles and discovered that by passing water through straight
aluminium channels placed beneath a photovoltaic panel can achieve a substantial
amount of waste heat recovery from the cells. The study concluded that increasing
the number of nanoparticles in the PCM mix could subsequently reduce the cells
temperature even further, so making further improvements to the electrical, ther-
mal, overall, and exergy efficiencies. Figure 4.7 shows the arrangement of channels
proposed for cooling of the panel by Salem et al. [17].
Moreover, Abdelrazik et al. [18] performed an experimental investigation on
a combined PV/PCM module and discovered that depositing nanoparticles in
the PCM at different loadings can profoundly enhance the waste heat recovery
absorption by the material. In this study, graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) were mixed
in with paraffin wax (PW) which was used for heat absorption from a photovoltaic
panel. The experiment was conducted in a hot location and the results indicated that
significant electrical output efficiency can be obtained from the cells, even in the
warmer summertime. Karthikeyan et al. [19], nevertheless, managed to dissipate
the generated waste heat from a photovoltaic panel by using a radiation-based
composite PCM. In their study, a thermal heat transfer network was utilised
which predominantly eliminated the PCM reconduction mode and resulted in an
improvement in the thermal energy absorption by the material. This then resulted
in overall efficiency improvements from the panel even at higher cell temperatures.

4 Medium-Temperature Applications
Notwithstanding the benefits of using PCMs, it should be noted that the use of
water- or air-based heat exchangers are, as yet, the most predominant of all the
methods of waste heat recovery from photovoltaic panels. For instance, Elminshawi
et al. [20] forced the ambient air through a buried heat exchanger that was con-
nected to several channels at the bottom surface of a photovoltaic panel and by doing
so, managed to dissipate the waste heat from the cells. At the time of the tests, the
ambient air was at three temperatures of about 35, 40, and 45 ∘C and pre-cooled air
at various flow rates were supplied to the back of the panel to perform waste heat
dissipation from the cells. The technique allowed the panel to be kept below the ref-
erence cell temperature which, in return, improved the average daily efficiency by a
minimum of 18%. It was also suggested, that by recovering this waste heat from the
panel, the thermal efficiencies of the whole system could also be increased by almost
40%. Figure 4.8 shows the configuration of the buried heat exchanger proposed by
Elminshawi et al. [20].
Baloch et al. [21], on the other hand, used a similar approach and employed a
converging channel heat exchanger to absorb and dissipate the waste heat from the
bottom surface of a photovoltaic panel and demonstrated the dependence on the
particular shape of the converging channels, so by optimising the same, the photo-
voltaic cells can be effectively cooled by almost 10 ∘C, which can result in significant
power output and conversion efficiency improvements.
Soliman and Hassan [22] investigated the potentiality of using microchannels and
heat spreaders to exchange the waste heat generated from photovoltaic cells to a
flow of cooling water and discovered, through this technique, the net power effi-
ciency from the panel can be increased by nearly 4%. In the study, several exper-
iments were conducted using different configurations of microchannel and heat
spreader systems with coolant water examined at different concentration ratios and
Reynolds numbers. Hossain et al. [23] used a similar idea and managed to recover
and utilise the generated waste heat by introducing a novel parallel serpentine pipe

flow configuration to the bottom surface of a photovoltaic panel. In this study, water,
as the coolant, was passed at different volume flow rates through the pipe system and
it was discovered that the technique, although simple, could improve the energy con-
version efficiency of the panel by nearly 0.23% per 1 ∘C. The results indicated that the
electrical output efficiency of the photovoltaic panel can therefore reach a maximum
of almost 9%. Figure 4.9 shows the parallel serpentine-type flow configuration.
Having recognised the importance of the above state-of-the-art thermal manage-
ment technologies, it is important to recall that the use of heat pipes as a means of
waste heat recovery from photovoltaic panels has also been shown to be just as an
effective solution by several studies. For instance, Jouhara et al. [24] conceived the
innovative idea and design of a unique flat heat pipe heat exchanger – namely a heat
mat – to efficiently and effectively remove and transfer the waste heat from different
types of photovoltaic panels. Their study showed that by attaching the heat mat to the
bottom surface of photovoltaic modules, the waste heat generated by panel can be
absorbed and transferred to a cooling manifold, where a coolant such as water is used
to manage the temperature of the heat pipe. Thanks to the specific properties of the
heat pipe, the study demonstrated that the photovoltaic panels could be cooled and
kept at a relatively constant temperature and the experimental outcomes showed
that this resulted in an improvement of electrical energy output efficiency by almost
15%. In addition, Jouhara et al. [25], in another study, furthermore demonstrated
that the technology can be also used as a substitute for building envelope material,
and the performance of the heat mat was examined in terms of its contribution to a
district heating application. In this, an experiment was performed to investigate the
functionality of the developed heat pipe-based photovoltaic-thermal panel under dif-
ferent solar irradiation conditions. The results from the study showed that the system
is capable of delivering the thermal requirements of a single-family house on days
with high solar radiation, and up to nearly 60% of the dwelling’s hot water needs
on days with low radiation [24]. Figure 4.10 shows the heat mat PV/T setup and
Figure 4.11 presents the experimental roof installation by Jouhara et al. [25].
Other technologies such as pulsating heat pipes (PHPs) have also been utilised
as effective waste heat recovery solutions that can be used to thermally manage
photovoltaic panels. Thanks to the two-phase heat transfer properties, and as
explained by Alizade et al. [26], PHPs are rather compact heat transfer devices that
offer high heat transfer thermal performance. Based on this and in a study, it was

demonstrated that by attaching a PHP to the underneath of a photovoltaic panel,
the panel can be effectively cooled and nearly an 18% increase in electrical output
efficiency can be obtained.
Also of interest here, Yu et al. [27] investigated the functionality of a novel solar
microchannel loop-heat-pipe photovoltaic/thermal system (MC-LHP-PV/T), where,
in this study, a coaxial tubular heat exchanger was used as a condenser for a loop
heat pipe (LHP) which was attached to the underneath of a photovoltaic panel. This
particular configuration allowed the photovoltaic panel to act as the evaporator of
the heat pipe, so when viable waste heat is available, the working fluid absorbs and
transfers that to the condenser section where it is delivered to a stream of coolant.
The study furthermore discovered that the output solar efficiencies largely depend
on several factors, such as the inlet temperature and flow rate of the coolant, the
ambient temperature, and the actual distance between the evaporator and the con-
denser section. To explain this further – the higher the mass flow rate and the lower
the inlet temperature of the coolant; the higher the ambient temperatures and the
larger the distance between the condenser and the evaporator of the system, the
higher the solar thermal output efficiencies.
Based on this, the study demonstrated that a peak solar thermal efficiency of
nearly 70% can be achieved at an optimal system operating condition when the
water coolant inlet temperature is at about 18 ∘C and the flow rate is at 0.17 m3/h.
The height distance between the condenser and the evaporator was indicated to
be at 1.3 m and the ambient temperature was recorded as approximately 30 ∘C.
Relating this to tests under actual solar radiation, the system managed to obtain
a maximum peak solar thermal efficiency of around 62% whilst the electrical
efficiency delivered was shown to be at a minimum of about 16%. Figure 4.12 shows
the design of the MC-LHP-PV/T system by Yu et al. [27].

Geothermal Energy
Geothermal energy is the heat contained beneath the Earth’s crust within the
sub-surface of the Earth that stimulates numerous volcanic processes across the
globe. The overall heat content of the planet is estimated to be 12.6 × 1024 MJ. Part
of this energy is available at high concentrations near the surface in a variety of
geologically active areas [28]. This energy supply is sustainable, green, and can
be extracted for a number of uses, including the generation of electricity. The
schematic of a geothermal power plant is shown in Figure 4.13.
Typically, the geothermal source is accessible at a depth of 2–3 mi (3–5 km) below
the surface of the Earth, where rocks can reach temperatures of over 150 ∘C. Holes
are then drilled to allow the water to be pumped into these porous rocks to extract the
energy. As the water interacts with the porous bed, it is converted to steam which is
then used to power a turbine on the surface to generate electricity. The path through
which the water is injected into the rocks is called the well of injection, and the path
through which the steam rises is called the well of production.
Since geothermal resources are environmentally sustainable, significant advances
have been made in both the utilisation technologies and the geothermal resource
drilling technologies, and the use of geothermal energy has been rapidly grow-
ing worldwide, especially in the field of geothermal district space heating for
buildings.

4.4 Geothermal Energy
231
There are three basic types of geothermal power plants [29]:
1. Dry steam power plant: In this type of power plant, the steam produced when the
groundwater reaches the hot porous rocks is directly used to operate a turbine to
produce energy. This power stations demand fluids at a temperature of at least
150 ∘C [30].
2. Flash steam power plant: This power plants are typically installed in geother-
mal reservoirs with temperatures above 182 ∘C. Within the separator, the hot
water that emerges from the output wells flashes into steam, where the pressure
reduces. This vapour is isolated from the liquid water and is then used to power
the turbine. This process is the most common form of power plant used for the
production of electricity.
3. Binary-cycle power plants: In a binary-cycle power plant, the heat from the water
that comes out of the production well is exchanged with another fluid that is then
used to run the turbine. Using this method (low-grade heat recovery), energy
from geothermal sources can be recovered at a lower temperature, typically
between 107 and 182 ∘C. Currently, low-grade heat recovery (based on binary
cycle) options are gaining prominence.
A binary-cycle power plant is primarily used for heat recovery from low-
temperature geothermal sources [31]. It allows the use of geothermal energy that
cannot otherwise be used to produce electricity. Typically, this plant works on the
ORC or Kalina cycle, and the working fluid is a low boiling point organic fluid [32].
New Zealand’s Ngatamariki geothermal power plant uses a binary cycle to collect
energy from a high-enthalpy geothermal source and produces 100 000 kW of electric
power [33]. The production wells have a high temperature of about 290 ∘C, and no
water is used to draw energy from the source.
The performance of the geothermal power plant can be enhanced by recycling and
using waste heat from the plant in combination with thermodynamic cycles [34].
Wang et al. [35], evaluated the prospective geothermal infrastructure in China’s
Tianjin City and concluded that introducing further phases to the power generation
system could result in higher net power output and enhanced geothermal resource
utilisation. Growing the number of phases, however, also increases expenditure
and maintenance costs. In most cases, given the expense and economic advan-
tages, it is advised that the number of steps be reduced to two, and that potential
schemes for integrating these cycles be pursued to produce or recover more
energy [36].
The fluids leaving the geothermal power plants are usually over 60 ∘C and, in
most situations, this available heat is not retrieved. The heat from the fluid can
be extracted for a variety of uses and can be used for either additional power
generation or direct heating applications. The hot water remaining after generation
in a geothermal power plant can be used for numerous heating purposes, which
are typically low-temperature applications [37], but if the hot water flowing from
the power plants is immediately fed into appropriate applications, or the heat
exchanger collects heat from the hot water, it can then be used in more complex
applications.

232
4 Medium-Temperature Applications
Some of the forms in which the heat recovered from the power plants can be used
are described as follows:
●Space heating: Waste heat can be fed into a district heating system and used for
space heating purposes. Usually, it is suggested that geothermal resources as low
as 20 to 30 ∘C can be used for space heating, especially in northern regions [37].
For instance, in Tianjin, China, about 620 × 106 m2 of space heating was generated
by geothermal wells in the region [36].
●Aquaculture applications: To control the water temperature for sustaining
water-based flora and fauna [38].
●Horticulture applications: In 2008, Dutch developers used geothermal waste heat
at 60 ∘C to provide 60–90% of the energy requirements for growing tomatoes [38].
●Heating the outdoor and indoor pools, which is now a tourist destination in Ice-
land and Croatia.
The heat from the geothermal resource can be used ‘in series’ for more than a few
purposes. Dickson and Fanelli [28] explored the scenario of cascading applications
in a location where the atmosphere is cold and snowy and a geothermal source at a
temperature of 150 ∘C is available. A binary power plant operating between 80 and
150 ∘C may use the brine from a geothermal source to generate electricity. The fluid
that leaves the turbine would then be at a temperature of 80 ∘C.
This fluid would then enter the district heating system at 80 ∘C and exit at 40 ∘C
to supply heat to residential buildings. The fluid leaving the district heating system
could then be used to heat swimming pools and public baths, which, it must be said,
normally demand the fluid to be at a temperature of 50 ∘C. This fluid, from which
the energy is recovered, then exits at 25 ∘C.
On snowy days, the de-icing of roads and parking lots allows the fluid to be at
30 ∘C and the fluid that leaves the balneological unit can fulfil this demand. The
final outflow fluid is then estimated to be at a temperature of 10 ∘C. So, by such
methods of cascading energy use, geothermal resources can be well utilised, and
their applications maximised.
The Nesjavellir high-enthalpy geothermal system, sited in the southwest of Ice-
land, is a co-generation power plant that generates power and operates as a district
heating system [39]. The surplus heat from the power plant is used to heat water
up to 75 ∘C and supports about 180 000 residents in the district of Reykjavik. This
district heating system is an example of a cascading system since the water, after
space heating, is between 25 and 40 ∘C and is then used for de-icing applications.
The overall length of the pipeline in the project is 2157 km, and the success of this
district heating project has contributed to the discovery of other geothermal sources
for district heating systems in Iceland.
The Altheim Geothermal Project in Austria derives heat from a low enthalpy
geothermal source, where the water from the output well is heated to a temper-
ature of up to 104 ∘C [40]. This water is subdivided into two sources, one part
of which goes into the ORC to generate electrical electricity, and the other part
into the district heating system to service 1500 households consuming approxi-
mately 10 000 Kilowatt-thermal (kWth) of electricity. From the ORC, the water

(at about 70 ∘C) is cascaded to a regional school and swimming pool to provide
approximately 1000 kWth of heating.
Summaries of numerous waste heat applications of geothermal systems are pre-
sented in Table 4.3.

Automotive Industry
Amongst the big problems that face humankind in the coming years are the prob-
lems of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimising our global footprint,
but, the same time, our energy needs are still rising every day. Hence the recovery
of wasted thermal energy for conversion to electricity, although part of the solution,
is still seen as a major challenge for researchers and industry. Thermoelectricity, in
the form of thermoelectric generators, has a strong potential for waste heat recovery,
and has been researched and demonstrated in a variety of experimental and theo-
retical works; considering how to use thermoelectric generators to recover part of
the energy that is usually lost during the production operation and then convert this
into electricity.
In this respect, the transport sector might be the most desirable sector in which
to use thermoelectric generators to recover lost heat, because until now, there have
been few solutions to recycle the excess heat from engine exhaust gas. Unquestion-
ably, one of the most successful fields for energy recovery is, and will be, the automo-
bile market, where competition for ever-cleaner automobiles is quite dynamic and
government-sponsored. In addition, the aeronautics field is also looking at the use
of hot gases from aircraft or helicopter engines, and, of course, maritime transport
provides unique possibilities due to the availability of a free cold sink (fresh water or
seawater).
Automotive industrialists are projecting a great deal of interest in thermoelec-
tric generators in order to turn the heat wasted within the exhaust gas produced
by an internal combustion (IC) engine into electrical energy [43]. In a motor car,
only about 25% of the fuel-fired capacity is used for vehicle mobility and operating
accessories, whilst 40% is wasted within the exhaust gas [44]. On the other hand, the
amount of heat generated from the exhaust system is very high and could range from
100 to 800 ∘C with a thermal output of up to 10 kW depending on the vehicle speed
and the fuel category, making this amount of heat a valuable source of sustainable
and adequate energy.
The transfer of emitted heat would also be the key solution for enhancing engine
efficiency and supplying additional electronic equipment such as guidance systems,
electronic brakes, additional powertrain/body controllers, stability sensors, telem-
atics, and accident prevention systems for conventional and hybrid vehicles, and
would also help reduce atmospheric emissions and energy cost.
Given the wide range of IC engines, it is essential to develop more than one form
of thermoelements, all of which would contribute to improving the efficiency of con-
version. As such, segmented thermoelectric materials have been used for this form
of application due to their broad range of the temperature extraction [45].

In addition to the segmented thermoelectric generator (TEGs), cascaded TEGs
have also been investigated for vehicle applications [46], because the independent
mechanical structure of this method enables the incompatibility of the segmented
arrangement to be avoided. Wilbrecht and Beitelschmidt [47] introduced two phases
of cascaded thermo electric (TE) materials for railway vehicles. The cascaded TEG
was made of Bi2Te3 (220 ∘C) and Mg2SiSn/MnSi (410 ∘C) and provided 2.5 kW of
electrical power.
As discussed within the literature, two TEG positions have been used within an
IC engine system – within the cooling mechanism (radiator) and within the exhaust
heat exchanger. The first method was reported by Crane et al. [48], in which they pre-
sented the modelling of the integrated TEG radiator and demonstrated its potential
to supplement the power output from the cooling system to the alternator.
The generators were mounted between the radiator surface and the fins. The esti-
mated temperature difference between the radiator and the fins system was approxi-
mately 80 ∘C, but in addition, the engine load also influences the heat transfer to the
radiator and the output power of the TEG. Hence a unit employing a Bi2Te3-based
TEG even at low engine loads (25%) was able to produce more than 1 kW of electrical
power, this could supplement the power output from the alternator and result in a
major increase in fuel efficiency.
The second described method of positioning a TEG within the exhaust heat system
extracts energy from the exhaust gases as they flow from the catalytic converter to
the muffler/silencer. Heat exchangers or this type of application are available in two
forms: flat and cylindrical, and the placement of flat TEGs on the surface of the
exhaust heat exchanger has been analysed [49] for this high temperature source. For
the study, the TE modules were attached to the exhaust device surface in a matrix
shape – heat flowing through the exhaust inlet to the exhaust outlet giving thermal
energy to the hot sides of the TEG. The study addresses the placement of 32 TEG
units, each with 24 TCs, on to a flat exhaust gas. For cold TE units, coolant heat
exchangers – often liquid heat exchangers – are the most commonly used to sustain
cold temperatures.
Orr et al. [43] presented the use of gas heat exchangers with liquid heat pipes con-
nected to both the cold and hot sides of the TEG, the hot waste gas stream entering
the exhaust conduit, where eight water pipes are integrated into the channel fins and
connected to the hot side of the eight TEG units. A fan was mounted in the inlet of the
cool air channel, and the cold channel also included eight water heat pipes, which
were built into the fins and connected to the cold side of the TEGs. Hussain et al. [50]
used water-cooled heat sinks to have a minimum temperature at cold junctions for
six modules of 96 Bi2Te3-based TCs each and to produce 14 W at ΔT = 200 ∘C [51].
Hussain et al. also proposed a direct loop to the coolant fluid radiator to retain cold
junctions at lower temperatures.
4.5.1
Industrial Processes
Industry is an area where heat is always a by-product of most operations, and in
certain cases, some of this heat is reused to supply heating networks or converted

236
4 Medium-Temperature Applications
into electrical energy by steam turbines – Rankine or Stirling engines – but much
of the time this heat is simply wasted to the atmosphere. Accordingly, various waste
heat recycling projects using TEGs have been studied.
A field test of a thermoelectric generation system was began [52] at the carburising
furnace of a factory. Residual carburising gas containing CO, H2, and N2 is burnt
at the site, and this resulted in a burning capacity of 20 kW, which continuously
heated the hot side of the TEG. The TEG consisted of 16 Bi2Te3 modules and a heat
exchanger that received about 20% of the heat (4 kW). The highest electrical output
was about 214 W, which reflects an efficiency of 5%, however the electricity used to
cool the cold side of the modules was not included with these results.
Aranguren et al. [53] performed laboratory analyses and mathematical tests for a
TEG configured to recover waste heat from a combustion chamber. In their inves-
tigation, they included the energy used by the TEG cooling system and addressed
various heat exchangers. They concluded that their prototype had a theoretical
output of 100 W/m2, and applying this finding to a large industrial chimney on a
ceramic tile furnace with a flue gas mass flow of 18 400 Nm3/h and a temperature
of 187 ∘C, they forecasted an expected average electrical output of 136 MWh
annually [54].
Likewise, the steel industry also produces a lot of waste heat, particularly radi-
ant heat from steel products and so TEGs are possible and reliable candidates for
the recovery of radiant heat from molten metal, and one company has introduced
a 10 kW TEG method (about 4 m × 2 m) using radiant heat from continuous casting
slabs [55]. The TEG is attached to the grid and consists of 896 TE modules (56 TEG
units of 16 Bi2Te3 TE) and produces approximately 9 kW when the slab temperature
is about 915 ∘C.
Cement manufacturing is also an energy-consuming industrial process, and Luo
et al. [56] have researched the feasibility of applying TEGs to Portland cement pro-
duction. Approximately 10–15% of the energy is dissolved directly into the atmo-
sphere through the outer surface of the rotary turbine, but due to the permanent
movement of the furnace, this kind of waste heat is difficult to recover. For a fur-
nace with a 4.80 m outer diameter and 72 m in length, the gross heat loss without
the TEG recovery system is approximately 10 000 kW. A coaxial shell was consid-
ered on the inside of the rotary kiln filled with Bi2Te3–PbTe hybrid TE modules
and a theoretical model developed which estimated that for 20 units with 3480 TE
modules (30 × 30 mm2) each, the total TE system will generate 210 kW and save
3280 kW because of the insulation shell. The impact of thermoelectric generation
being roughly 2%.
These numerous examples and industrial investigations have shown that TEGs
have two key opportunities for industrial manufacturing: either in situations
where it is challenging to recycle excess heat from traditional systems (radiated
heat energy) or in circumstances where modern TEG materials are able to pro-
vide maintenance-free and low-cost electrical power, even considering the low
performance.

4.6 Aviation
237
4.6
Aviation
Waste heat recovery in the aviation and aerospace industry is a topic which has not
been extensively researched, primarily because of certain design parameters such as
weight limitations associated with aircraft. Yet, ever-escalating fuel prices and the
harmful products emitted by aircrafts has resulted in many studies to investigate
different theoretical and experimental methods to recover heat, mainly from the air-
craft engines, and utilise that recovered heat in other segments of an aircraft system
for overall efficiency improvements.
For example, Saadon [57] proposed a one-dimensional analysis method and
investigated the functionality of using an ORC for waste heat recovery utilisation
in turbofan engines. The paper included a numerical model and predicted the
performance of a turbofan engine integrated to an ORC. The result of the study
showed that the thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) using the waste heat
recovery configuration reached a value of almost 0.9 lbm/lbf h when the thrust force
was at about 7000 lbf. Having taken into consideration weight factor of the system,
the results translated into a 2% reduction of fuel consumption, indicating that the
implementation of the ORC waste heat recovery system to an aircraft engine could
provide substantial economic and environmental benefits to the aerospace and
aviation industry. Figure 4.14 shows an ORC system integrated into an aircraft
engine.
That said, the use of other state-of-the-art technologies such as TEGs are still
recognised as the most promising area of investigation for waste heat recovery in
aerospace and aviation industries and for which, for example, Ziolkowski et al. [59]

used finite element modelling simulations to analyse the performance of a TEGs in
recovering waste heat to generate power. The modelled device was placed between
the cold bypass flow and the hot core stream of a turbofan engine nozzle, and the
result from the study showed that, in order to obtain a positive effect on the specific
fuel consumption, a direct balance between the TEG design specification (relating
to the element length and filling factor) needs to be implemented. The work
indicated that achievable and viable power output can be obtained by optimising
the thermoelectric material and varying the conductive heat transfer coefficient
between the flow stream and the hot nozzle surfaces. Through this method, the
study also showed that by extending the TEG cover around the whole surface
of the nozzle, the power output from the system can reach nearly 1.65 kW for
each engine of the aircraft. The study therefore demonstrated the positive effect
on fuel consumption reduction that can be achieved by varying the design of the
device, indicating its potential for a cost-efficient and high-performance waste heat
recovery technology.
As a further example, the effect of integrating a TEG device inside an airliner
engine nozzle was demonstrated by Büchter et al. [60]. In the study, a rudimen-
tary Breguet range-equation model was developed and fuel savings potentials were
investigated by taking into consideration the engine specification. The model consid-
ered a simple off-design mission model and compared this against a more complex
mission-based model in respect of the aircraft size and mission specification, and
the study concluded that the output delivered by the technology for the mentioned
models are rather comparable. Nevertheless, in order to reach a break-even fuel
efficiency, a specific power density of about 180 W/kg of weight is required to be
delivered by the device.
Having noted that the study further investigated the relationship between the heat
flux limitations and fuel consumption reduction and explored this with a specific
TEG device that presents 270 W/kg of power density, thereby showing that fuel sav-
ings of nearly 0.05% can be achieved; although, as might be expected, this result
categorically depends on the size and type of engine being used. For instance, and
based on further investigations, it has been demonstrated that by using a lighter TEG
device that delivers a specific power density of around 100 W/kg, it is possible to
achieve higher fuel saving potentials of about 0.1%.
As has already been inferred, enhancing the heat transfer coefficient is an impor-
tant factor in increasing the electrical output efficiency from TEG devices, because
the heat flux applied through the device is largely affected by the boundary layer
around the device. Hence, placing the TEG device into the hotter areas of the engine
nozzle – where higher temperature gradients and waste heat are available – can
potentially increase the heat flux through the device and hence improve the specific
power density and TEG efficiency.
Going forward, Bode et al. [61] studied the potential of future thermoelectric
energy recovery for the aviation industry and showed that for a conceptual aircraft
engine starting commence service by the year 2030, considerable energy efficiency
improvements can be achieved through the use of TEG technology. In this regard,
an advanced engine design called GasTurb was selected as a reference engine and an

239
evolutionary TEG device was used to perform analytical performance simulations.
The results showed through a design that includes the use of heat pipes, significant
efficiencies of up to 7% can be achieved. Nevertheless, it must be remembered
that this study is entirely futuristic, and any such figures delivered will require
advancements in both the aircraft engine, heat exchanger, and thermoelectric
generator technologies.
A preliminary analysis undertaken by Boeing Science & Technology also found
a decrease in fuel consumption of 0.5% (or more) can be obtained with TEGs. The
study [62] on turbine nozzles with Bi2Te3 modules shows that the electrical power
generated under real operating conditions is substantial, but is currently inadequate
if the weight of the cold exchanger is included.
Heat can be stored on the turboshaft on the compressor section, combustion cham-
ber, and exhaust pipe. TEGs could therefore be attached to these various positions,
but they must not have any effect on that turboshaft working stage which therefore
prevents the use of heat exchangers. In addition, heat travelling through the TEG
must be emitted elsewhere. Of course, fuel, oil, air, or compressed air are all available
for this purpose, but if these must be added to the TEG, it will raise the total weight of
the system. Hence and currently, the incorporation of TEGs (0.05 kW/kg-module as
state-of-the-art) would not fulfil the criteria for aircraft power density (0.5 kW/kg),
and these findings were subsequently confirmed in the Thetagen [63] European
review. The road map for the future is therefore likely to come up against the lim-
itations of either adding TEGs to the configuration of the aircraft engine or to add
them to an environment where there is already a hot heat flow and a cold heat flow.
Of course, new, lightweight TE materials will also lead, but it should be noted that
the weight of the equipment must also be include the overall weight of the heat
exchanger.

High-Temperature Applications
Previous chapters, in particular Chapter 2, have described, in detail, the various
waste heat recovery (WHR) technologies available. This section examines case
studies of WHR applied to high-temperature applications – categorised as energy
recovery at temperatures over 400 ∘C. It must be stressed that a higher temperature
is not necessarily synonymous with increased energy recovery. Temperature is
only one parameter. The energy content is also determined, for example, by the
mass flow rate of the heat source and whether the entire waste heat content can be
recovered. Many high-temperature heat streams contain corrosive gases that would
condense if these gases were to drop below their dew point and so the temperature
is usually kept above this value, thereby limiting the potential energy recovery.
Hence an ideal scenario would be a clean, high temperature, high flow rate heat
source that can be reduced to ambient temperature in order to maximise energy
recovery.
To a large extent, applications of WHR technology on an industrial scale are in the
private sector and as such a large number of case studies are not available for publi-
cation. In addition, many companies are not willing to disclose process information
so as to retain their commercial advantage. Whilst understandable, this does create a
barrier to disseminating information on WHR technologies and cloaks information
about its application to real industrial settings rather than sourced from research
bodies or equipment suppliers. For these reasons, simulation studies have also been
included in addition to case studies of real-world examples.
High-temperature applications are usually associated with the recovery of energy
from combustion processes, but other applications also include nuclear, electrical
resistance, or electrically induced waste heat sources. With this in mind, as broad
a range of examples of possible applications have been compiled so as to provide a
more extensive representation of WHR opportunities. Table 5.1 highlights the tech-
nologies discussed within this chapter.

because of the significant volume processed, the amount of energy consumed is also
amongst the largest of the secondary sector industries. The potential therefore for
heat recovery is also very large and several studies have been conducted to reduce
the amount of energy wastage throughout the various processes – the main recovery
methods being focused on the optimisation of burners and heat exchangers.
5.1.1
TEG Modules
A thermoelectric generator (TEG) can be used to generate electrical power from a
heat source and generate hot water. Ghosh et al. [1] numerically investigated the use
of a TEG module to recover heat and generate electrical power during the cooling
process of hot steel slabs. The TEG module is placed above the hot steel slab with the
heat collection plate of the TEG operating by natural convection and heat transfer
via radiation. Thermoelectric legs will then generate electrical power whilst the heat
sink will be cooled by water. An illustration can be seen in Figure 5.1.
In the study, the thermoelectric module was exposed to the slab at a distance of
2 m with a thermoelectric leg thickness of 3 mm and the results show that the TEG
module was able to recover up to 4.6% for a heat source at 1.5 kW/m2. The gen-
erated electrical output is estimated to be at approximately 0.2 US$/W. The main
issue highlighted by this study is the temperature of the slab being quite high for this
type of material. This technology is still in development, and the cost of a full-scale
installation would be high. Currently, research into TEG modules is quite extensive
with multiple studies being conducted to improve the cost, efficiency, and the size
of TEGs.

Heat Exchangers
5.1.2.1
Application 1: Slag Particles Blast Furnace Retroﬁt
A potential for process improvement was identified by Liu et al. [2] utilising the slag
particles produced during a smelting process. Slag is a by-product of metal produc-
tion because when processing an ore, any impurities are separated from the molten
metal and these impurities are referred to as slag. The hot slag is usually discarded
to disposal facilities, however the energy contained within this slag offers a huge

potential for WHR. In the investigation, the authors presented a combination of two
WHR technologies: a waste heat boiler and a heat exchanger as shown in Figure 5.2.
The system consisted of a bed and a serpentine heat exchanger connected to a steam
pipe network and a steam turbine/condenser system. The waste slag enters from the
top of the bed and when passing through the coil its heat is released to a working
fluid, which vapourises to generate steam.
The experimental investigation presented by the authors considered the addition
of slag particles ranging between 300 and 700 ∘C and the outcome of the study
highlighted varying efficiencies ranging between 60% and 95%, depending on the
Reynolds number, tube arrangement, and temperature of the slag particles. The
application of this technology is promising because it offers both high efficiencies
and high heat transfer rates, but it is currently limited to laboratory-scale appli-
cations. As with many emerging technologies, scalability can be a limiting factor,
causing detrimental effects to the final efficiencies. However, it is important to note
that one of the key products from this technology is the production of steam. The
steam and high-temperature water can be repurposed for other technologies within
a processing plant, to preheat rollers and the like.
5.1.2.2
Application 2: Flat Heat Pipe Heat Exchanger
One large contributor to the inefficiency of a steel processing plant is the cooling of
their different manufactured products, and this presents multiple opportunities and
a vast untapped potential for heat recovery from these cooling processes to thereby
increase the efficiency of metal production. For example, Jouhara et al. [3] developed
and installed a radiative heat pipe to recover heat from the cooling conveyor in a
metal wire production line. The heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) consists of a row

of tubes connected by a bottom collector and a shell and tube condenser section with
an additional feature of a back panel to increase the WHR. Water passes through
the cooling pipe to the condenser to extract the heat from the heat pipe system and
which can then be used to preheat other systems within the processing plant. An
illustration of the system can be seen in Figure 5.3.
The heat pipe is placed above the conveyor as shown in Figure 5.4, and heat is
transferred from the wire to the evaporator section of the heat pipe via radiation and
forced convection.
Even though the experimental setup covered only a small surface area of the con-
veyor, the heat pipe still managed to recover up to 15.6 kW at a water flow rate of
0.38 kg/s when the hot steel wire was at 450 ∘C. So, by applying this system to the
entirety of the conveyor (approximately 100 m long with a heat pipe only 1 m in
width) the recovered waste heat could significantly increase the process efficiency. In
addition, it is also important to note that the presented flat heat pipe (FHP) does not
impact the temperature of the wire, however, the initial cost of the installation could
be problematic. Advantageously, heat pipe technology has a relatively low mainte-
nance cost, and providing high efficiencies, the FHP is still a good candidate for
emerging waste heat technologies within the steel manufacturing process industry.

Application 1: Heat Recuperator for Steel Slag
As noted earlier, WHR from the slag produced by smelting is becoming one of the
main areas of research and innovation for WHR within the steel industry, and in rela-
tion to which a new type of heat recuperator was developed by Trashorras et al. [4].
The heat recuperator is located after the blast furnace, and the slag produced by the
furnace is transferred by conveyor to a slag tank which then feeds a heat recuper-
ator conveyor. The heat recuperator conveyor is fully enclosed in an alumina brick

lining, inserted into the internal wall of which are the heat exchanger tubes as shown
in Figure 5.5.
Molten salt flows through the tube channels to extract the heat from the slags and
an illustration of the process can be seen in Figure 5.6.
The system was studied through a computer simulation, the results of which indi-
cated a recovery of 23.2 MW of heat. This result points the way to the development
of a highly efficient system for successful heat recovery from metal slags, but due to
the size of the recuperator, the scalability of the technology could be challenging. It
is also important to note that the conditions used for any simulation may not always
reflect real life because a significant number of assumptions need to be made for any
computational study.

Ceramic Industry
5.2.1
Introduction
The ceramic industry is one of the key energy consumers within the secondary
processing industries, but due to the nature of the process not many WHR tech-
nologies can address the corrosive exhaust stream. Unlike the metallurgy-based
industries introduced in this chapter, the ceramic industry presents its own
unique set of problems, revolving mainly around the final products produced. The
brittleness of ceramics is the main downfall because any changes in production
temperature can structurally compromise the integrity of the final product.
Nonetheless, the ceramic industry is still a key candidate for WHR, with the main
focus being on the development of heat exchangers, and over the past few years a
small number of investigations have been conducted utilising HPHEs to improve
the overall efficiency of ceramic kilns.
5.2.2
Heat Exchangers
5.2.2.1
Application 1: Radiative Heat Pipe
A significant amount of energy in a ceramic tile production line is dissipated in the
cooling section of the kiln. The wall of the kiln will radiate heat to its surroundings
and in the process will waste energy to the environment and cause an unnecessary
generation of corresponding CO2 emissions – all in order to regulate the cooling
profile. So to help address this issue, a preliminary investigation was conducted by
Delpech et al. [5]. A heat pipe system was designed to recover the heat from the tile
whilst it is within the slow cooling section of the kiln as shown in Figure 5.7. The
radiative heat pipe acts as an active cooling device for the tile in order to achieve a
uniform temperature over the tile during its cooling period.
Figure 5.7
Radiative heat pipe in a
laboratory ceramics kiln.

252
5 High-Temperature Applications
The heat pipe system is separated into two sections: an evaporator section – located
within the kiln – which extracts heat from the tile, and then a condenser
section – arranged in a shell and tube configuration – extracts heat from the heat
pipe. Finally, the recovered heat is then transported to dryers or used to preheat the
incoming air for the gas burners. The developed technology allows for full integra-
tion into existing ceramic cooling sections, but it does mean that the technology is
intrusive and a section of the kiln needs to be removed for installation.
5.2.2.2
Application 2: Multi-Pass Heat Pipe
A laboratory-scale HPHE was developed by Brough et al. [6] to investigate the
potential for the use of a multi-pass HPHE in the ceramics industry as shown
in Figure 5.8. The HPHE consists of a tube bundle with baffles in the evaporator
section to maximise the available heat transfer area. Similarly, the condenser section
was also arranged with baffles.
The HPHE was connected to the exhaust stack of a ceramic kiln and Figure 5.9
shows the configuration of the HPHE and its control system. To control the outlet
temperature and prevent overheating, the evaporator section is connected to a
bypass system, water acting as a heat sink for the condenser section of the system.
The system was tested at a range of temperatures from 135 to 270 ∘C and the flow
rate of the exhaust stream was also modified to allow for a full characterisation of
the HPHE. The system was able to recover up to 63 kW for an exhaust temperature
of 270 ∘C at a flow rate of 1298 kg/h and a water flow rate of 1320 kg/h. This config-
uration of the HPHE is vertical and baffled, which both increases the compactness
of the system and reduces its footprint, but the main limitations of HPHEs are their
initial cost. Initial costs for traditional shell and tube heat exchangers are far lower
and so more attractive; however, the benefits of a low maintenance HPHE often out-
weigh the higher maintenance, more traditional heat exchangers, as discussed in
Chapter 2.

Application 3: Forced Convection Heat Pipe
As a third example of heat recovery applied to the ceramics industry, Delpech
et al. [7] designed and installed a HPHE on a ceramics roller earth kiln. This was
designed to cope with the high-temperature and heavy-particle-laden flow of the
exhaust stream from a ceramic processing plant as shown in Figure 5.10. The HPHE
designed consists of an evaporator section – for the hot exhaust gas, and a condenser
section which draws in cool ambient air. The heated air leaving the HPHE unit then
be used to supply clean hot air to the kiln burners and dryers.
The HPHE was tested at different working temperatures and conditions to deter-
mine the overall performance for the system. Table 5.2 shows the maximum operat-
ing conditions for the unit.
The total heat recovered by the installation and the total fuel and CO2 saving per
year are presented in Table 5.3.
The benefit of this installation are the low maintenance costs for the unit and the
smaller footprint in relation to the energy recovered.

Cement Industry
The cement industry is widely used across the construction industry and plays
an important role in the development of infrastructure. In 2019, approximately
4086 MT of cement was produced globally and, quickly increasing, this rapid expan-
sion accounts for 0.5% increase in carbon dioxide emissions annually, which by 2030
will increase to 0.8%. Studies conducted by the IEA suggest a significant amount
of this is caused by the high thermal energy intensity combined with the amount
of the clinker ingredient used. The decomposition of limescale needed to form
clinker is a significant contributor for CO2 production. It has been noted that an
increased efficiency in clinker production and reducing the thermal intensity of the

5.3 Cement Industry
255
process will actively reduce the amount of CO2 produced. An increased efficiency
has allowed the development of alternative materials to form a clinker substitute
and the use of biofuel-powered processes. These changes sound promising but
the structural integrity of the final product needs to be considered. An alternative
method to improve the efficiency of the cement industry is to adopt WHR methods
to reduce the amount of fuel consumed.
5.3.1
Gas Suspension Preheaters
Cement clinker is an intermediary solid material produced in the manufacture of
Portland cement and, although rotary kilns make up approximately 20% of clinker
production in the United States, worldwide it is now looked upon more favourably
to use a dry process kiln that uses heat from exhaust gas to dry the powder. Clinker
production makes up approximately 90% of delivered energy consumption and 74%
of total energy consumption. The main fuel used is coal, but natural gas and oil-fired
kilns are also available. Exhaust gases from power generation clinker cooling or stack
exhaust pass through the dry meal in a series of cyclones with 4–6 cyclones being
typical, although using fewer is possible depending on the scale of the plant [8].
The temperature of the waste heat is modified to suit the design of the plant. Cur-
rently a range between 204 and 1000 ∘C has been noted in literature as a waste heat
temperature, although the influence of flow rate has not been discussed [9].
5.3.1.1
Application 1
In the United Kingdom, there are two plants with gas suspension preheaters. By
installing gas suspension preheaters, the energy consumption was significantly
reduced from 5.65 to 3.5 GJ/t by replacing the existing kilns with preheater kilns.
A saving of 36% was reported [10].
Potentially these technologies can save up to 3 GJ/t by a reduction in operating
fuel. However, to counter this, there is an increased electricity consumption of
9 kWh/t per clinker. Table 5.4 provides the energy content per tonne of clinker

corresponding to the size of the preheater and, in comparison, if no preheating is
undertaken. Although the technology increases electricity consumption, the direct
emission reduction is also significant, as shown in Table 5.5.
5.3.1.2
Application 2
Caputo et al. [11] modelled a radiant heat recovery exchanger applied to a rotary kiln,
the authors discussing how 8–15% of heat input is lost through the exterior surface
of the kiln to ambient. To offset some of these losses, innovations in insulation were
installed but these were not able to provide drastic savings, leading, more recently,
to the use of WHR being considered. For this application, the chief approach being
studied is to pass water through tubes within a secondary shell and then use the
waste heat to preheat this water from the hottest sections of the kiln which, in prac-
tise, are the sections closest to the infeed where the majority of combustion takes
place. The authors showed that 2.5 MW could be recovered (1.75 MW actual) from
a tube bundle 20 m long and with a kiln wall temperature of 400 ∘C. However, the
authors also noted that there would be diminishing returns in the subsequent cooler
sections of the kiln because, for these stages, the water would already be at an ele-
vated temperature and this would reduce the heat transfer coefficient. However,
because the cost per unit length of the heat exchanger remains the same, a cost anal-
ysis was also conducted (as shown in Figure 5.11), the revenue from energy recovery
per section being plotted against cost. This shows that reasonable returns are only
made in the earlier sections of the kiln
5.3.2
Heat Pipe Thermoelectric Generator
One emerging technology of WHR is the use of TEGs (as discussed in Chapter 2).
This technology has been coupled with heat pipe technology and Wang
et al. [12] proposed the heat pipe thermoelectric generator (HPTEG) (shown
in Figure 5.12), which uses potassium as a working fluid to recover waste heat from
high-temperature industrial processes, and recognised cement production as an
example.
The following results were observed:
●At 630 ∘C, the HPTEG achieved a thermal conductivity of roughly 35.8 kW/m K.
●When the TEG part of the HPTEG reaches 200 ∘C, the thermal conductivity is
approximately 3 W/m K.

●A temperature difference of 600 ∘C induced a voltage over 40 V.
●A current of up to 20 A could be produced leading to an experimental performance
of up around 130 W, but less than theoretically predicted value of up to 250 W.
●The efficiency peaked at 7.5%, low, but acceptable for thermoelectric conversion.
5.4
Aluminium Industry
The aluminium industry is one of the largest metallurgy sectors, second only to the
steel industry, and both industries face similar issues from an environmental per-
spective. As aluminium is used for a wide range of applications and alloys, the use
of metallurgical processes is increasing by 3.6% annually, which is also contribut-
ing to a 1% annual increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases and 2.5% increase
of carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted into the atmosphere. A reduction in fuel and
electricity consumption is extremely desirable in energy-intensive industries, and a
significant amount of this can be achieved by WHR methods [13]. Table 5.6 shows a
list of extensive technologies applicable to the aluminium industry [14].
5.4.1
Rotary Regenerator
Rotary regenerators developed by Jasper GmbH aim to reclaim heat from furnace
exhaust gases. Crucially, high temperatures up to 1600 ∘C are targeted by this tech-
nology to reduce the exhaust gas temperature to between 140 and 310 ∘C. The tech-
nology highlights a 62% fuel reduction, and the recovered heat was used to reheat
combustion air for burners up to 1400 ∘C [15, 16]. (As discussed in Section 2.5.)
5.4.2
Heat Exchangers
Figure 5.13 shows a 528 kW exhaust-to-gas HPHE unit which was installed for the
aluminium industry in the United States. The evaporator inlet temperature (from the
exhaust stack) was approximately 400 ∘C and reduced to 266 ∘C; meanwhile within
the condenser section, cold ambient air at 30 ∘C, acting as a heat sink, was drawn
into the system. Lastly, the outlet temperature of the condenser section was 293 ∘C,
and this was used for air preheating. As a result of the installation, approximately
£155 k of equivalent energy was recovered per annum [17].
5.4.3
Heat Pumps
Nowicki and Gosselin [18] studied the application of heat pumps to Alcoa’s
Deschambault-Grondines primary aluminium smelter plant in Quebec province,
Canada, to recover waste heat for space heating purposes. The studies of the cast
house showed that approximately 4.9 MW of heat was available from the cast
house cooling water, with a further 2.5 MW being identified in the compressor
room, all using a water/glycol mixture. The study highlighted the potential if

a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of 4 were used. In addition, the
study also highlighted that the corresponding reduction in emissions would save
approximately 6 kt of CO2eq. if this waste heat was used for space heating purposes,
equating to a saving of around $ 300 000 per annum
5.4.4
Recuperators
5.4.4.1
Radiative Recuperator
Traditionally in the primary sectors operating at over 850 ∘C, radiative recuperators
were used to recover heat from exhaust gases with minimal pressure drop [19]. There
is some economic justification for their use with 40–60% efficiencies being seen, but
they require high maintenance and frequent cleaning due to fouling by condens-
able vapours and particulates [20]. In addition, they also require dilution to cool the
exhaust gas if metallic radiation recuperators are used; plus, other technologies now
available which are more effective at transferring heat.
Beltrán [21] studied this smaller radiative recuperator (applied to a lead glass
[crystal] furnace) to preheat the combustion air prior to the burner. The recuperator
was 1393 mm long with an internal diameter of 520 mm. The temperature of the
exhaust gas inlet averaged 880 ∘C but peaked at 1150 ∘C with the mass flow rate
of 0.0869 kg/s. The combustion air mass flow rate was similar at 0.084 kg/s and
averaged 37 ∘C. The exhaust gas was lowered to 515 ∘C and the combustion air
temperature was raised to 197 ∘C. However, the effectiveness was calculated to be
0.195 – which is extremely low – and this was attributed to the low heat transfer
coefficient of the radiation mechanism and to similar specific heat capacities and
mass flow rates for both streams.

5.4 Aluminium Industry
261
To their advantage, radiative recuperators have a very simple construction, con-
sisting of only two concentric tubes, and as such they tend to require lower capital
expenditure and are easy to install. They can be fitted into existing ducts (so do not
require the rerouting of ductwork) which reduces the system footprint. Also, due to
their simplicity of design and almost non-existent flow impedance, these exchang-
ers have one of the very lowest pressure drops (if not the lowest) compared to other
technologies and so they tend not to require additional power input from fans. Fur-
thermore, for these reasons, a high mass flow rate is achievable and the simple
design and low-pressure drop also help reduce the risk of fouling. Some designs can
include finning within the recuperator to increase the heat transfer coefficient and
heat transfer surface area, but then these can only be used for clean streams where
deposits will not build up on the fins
By way of disadvantages in comparison to other technologies, radiative recuper-
ators have a very low efficiency. Plus, during operation they suffer thermal stresses
from heating and cooling leading to fractures. Now this can be overcome by using
specialist materials, such as specialist alloyed steels or ceramics, but this will natu-
rally increase their capital cost.
5.4.4.2
Convective Recuperator
Case study examples of installations using convective recuperators are not read-
ily available. However, significant simulation work has been published regarding
their installation and material improvement [22]. One example of which, was the
modelled design for a convective recuperator applied to an aluminium furnace for
preheating combustion air from exhaust gases. The real-world example was a 5 × 20
row of tubes. Case studies for six applicable steel construction recuperator designs
were simulated with varying air and exhaust velocities. The temperature of the air
was assumed to be ambient (25 ∘C) and the exhaust was modelled at 1050 ∘C. The
outlet results of the simulations for both the air and exhaust gases are shown in
Table 5.7.
The exhaust flue gas temperatures were reduced by just under 300 ∘C and the air
was preheated by between 135 and 290 ∘C, depending on the air and exhaust inlet
velocity, hence the mass flow rate.

5 High-Temperature Applications
In operation, because of the high temperatures and material choices, tube lifes-
pans can be low – they suffer from bending, warping, and corrosion causing thinning
of the walls. Any point of failure within the system leads to contamination and
because the operation is not isothermal, cold spots can be present, which can give
rise to corrosion or thermal stresses leading to cracks which can then cause failure.
In addition, since it is not possible to view the installation during operation, regular
checks must be made to ensure structural integrity, and monitoring systems must be
in place to detect failure. The use of tube bundles causes a restriction in the flow of
the fluid streams resulting in a high-pressure drop with additional fan power being
required to overcome this – all at an increased cost. Plus, the high-pressure drop,
the change in stream direction, and the challenging stream composition means that
this technology is susceptible to fouling, thus reducing the effectiveness over time.
This leads to high maintenance costs as the units have to be treated as consumables
because cleaning the pipes is difficult which, even without replacement, would still
require their disconnection from the system.
5.4.4.3
Hybrid Recuperator
Hybrid recuperators are used when either a radiative or a convective recuperator
alone do not give the required performance. Typically, the exhaust stream is first
passed through the radiative recuperator in order to reduce its temperature prior to
the convective recuperator stage. As you would imagine, the advantages and disad-
vantages of both individual radiative and convective recuperators apply to a hybrid
unit, but a hybrid recuperator has a higher effectiveness than either recuperator
technology used in isolation because both radiation and convection thermal trans-
fer mechanisms apply. Hence, more energy can be recovered and there is greater
control over the heat recovery process because the system can be designed to suit
the needs of the facility. However, the design and installation are more complicated
and, as such, result in higher maintenance costs. It has also been noted that pres-
sure drops are higher compared to isolated systems, which can lead to fouling and a
requirement for additional fan power.
5.4.5
Thermoelectric Device
Yazawa and Shakouri [23] modelled water-cooled low profile thermoelectric devices
in a 54 cm thick refractory lining for a melting furnace. The furnace modelled was
utilised to melt glass pellets and furnace gases at 1500 ∘C used to maintain the molten
glass at 1000 ∘C. 10 kW/m2 heat flux thermoelectric devices were chosen and power
generation of up to 1.72 kW/m2 was estimated for the 500 t per day facility.
5.4.6
Regenerative Burner
Hassan and Al Kindi [24] conducted a feasibility study using regenerative burners on
aluminium holding furnaces by developing a thermodynamic model and validating
their results at a working foundry. Interestingly, the authors found that regenerative
burner furnaces were not profitable in saving energy and their use could shorten the

5.4 Aluminium Industry
263
lifespan of the furnace. The main reason for this was that an increase in combustion
air temperature resulted in a higher flame temperature, which then led to ther-
mal shocks within the refractory lining, increased dross generation, and metal alloy
degradation due to superheating of the surface of the molten metal bath. In fact, the
study found that the most significant factors for increasing the efficiency of operation
were (i) reducing the amount of time the furnace doors are open and (ii) reducing
the overall holding time.
Two further examples are:
(1) Bloom Engineering Co., Inc. installed a regenerative burner system within an
aluminium remelting furnace, and this involved six burners with two regenera-
tors, additional valving, and a new exhaust fan [25]. The unit preheated the air
temperature to approximately 525 ∘C from a furnace temperature of 600 ∘C. This
gave an additional 12% fuel saving and the overall furnace efficiency was 80.1%.
(2) Manatura and Tangtrakul [26] combined both a regenerative burner system with
a recuperator applied to a steel reheating furnace to preheat combustion air.
The furnace had a capacity of 30 T/h and preheated the steel to between 1100
and 1250 ∘C. The furnace was split into three sections: preheating, heating, and
soaking zones. The regenerative burners were rated at 2326 kW and applied to
the heat zone.
Originally, the recuperator could preheat the combustion air only to 300 ∘C
due to the material limits of the recuperator, but adding the regenerators
increased the combustion air temperature to 1000 ∘C. The energy balance
analysis then showed an additional 43% saving in energy consumption in
comparison to the conventional recuperative system (Table 5.8).

5.4.7
Preheating Scrap
Johansen and Strømhaug [27] measured energy input to a typical furnace cycle
where charged metal was preheated and then molten metal was added prior to
casting. They calculated the relative energy consumption used in the process and
found that around 75% of the energy was used to preheat the cold metal and only
18% during casting to prevent freezing and maintain metal temperature.
Albert [28] conducted a study on heat recovery systems including preheating sys-
tems. The study showed that 1.65 GWh per annum less energy would be required if
preheated aluminium charges were raised to 300 ∘C from a 20 ∘C ambient tempera-
ture. The tonnage considered was 55 T per charge for 365 charges. It was concluded
that the initial investment and additional handling did not justify this method of
WHR over others.
By preheating scrap, the melting time is decreased which decreases the cycle times
and subsequently increases productivity. It was found that preheating aluminium
to only 100 ∘C prior to casting reduced cycle times by eight minutes [29]. A further
study has shown a 25.5% increase in productivity by tonnage produced if exhaust
gases are used to preheat the charge [30]. This equates to a 21.1% energy saving for
the process. An invaluable health and safety benefit is achieved because the removal
of water content from scrap prevents superheated steam explosions.
However, even though the concept is relatively simple, the capital cost can be high
and the installation can involve major rerouting of ductwork if the preheating area
is located at a distance from the heat source. Furthermore, not only must the design
be sturdy to hold the weight, but it also has to be resistant to mobile plant impacts.
Additionally, extensive controls are required to prevent contact between operators
and the hot exhaust when loading and unloading the chamber. Additional care also
needs to be taken to maintain the integrity of the seals of the doors to the chamber
to avoid leakage of hot exhausts or of particulate laden gases.
Other problems include the following:
(1) The possibility of cooling the exhaust below their corrosive gas dew point
temperatures which should be avoided to prevent condensing these gases.
Furthermore, chimney design requires that there is enough velocity and
buoyancy to ensure the cleaned gases are punched into the atmosphere and do
not prematurely ground.
(2) If the exhaust temperature is too hot, the edges of the material can heat more
rapidly than conduction can pass energy through to the centre of the mass being
heated, and this can lead to the development of hot spots on the metal rather
than uniform melting. This is of particular concern in the aluminium industry
where aluminium and aluminium alloys have a low melting temperature. The
material being heated usually has a large thermal mass, so it can take a long
period of time to increase the temperature of the material. And Migchielsen [31]
reported that preheating a charge takes approximately the same amount of time
as it would do if melted in a melting furnace. So, this should also be taken into
account during the design process of the installation.

5.4.8
De-coating
Case studies on de-coating systems are limited and so only predicted savings from
manufacturers are provided in this section. Reference [32] provides a breakdown
of the savings for a 40 kT aluminium recycling facility, summarised in Table 5.9.
Material, in this case aluminium, is preheated to 400–500 ∘C, below the melting tem-
perature and enough to volatilise the organic content.
The organic material coating the scrap has calorific value and this can also be
used as a fuel to supply energy for de-coating the material or it can be returned to
the furnace [32, 33]. The advantage of de-coating can be seen in that the presence of
contamination from coatings can increase the oxidisation that occurs with the metal
during melting and, in fact, there is a direct correlation between percentage coating
present and amount of melt loss. For example, in the case of used beverage cans, the
melt loss is between 15% and 30% if melted with a coating compared to less than 6%
if the material is first pre-treated to remove the coating. Hence when the coating is
removed, although there is an increase in gross production time, to offset this there
is an increase in metal recovery. Also, the material melts over a shorter period of
time so there is less exposure for oxidation to occur and overall, this also results in
an increase in the recovery yield [34].
