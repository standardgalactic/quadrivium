Preface
The aim of this textbook is to provide the reader with an elementary introduction to fractal geometry and chaotic 
dynamics. These are subjects which have attracted immense interest throughout the whole range of numerate 
disciplines, including science, engineering, medicine, economics, and social science, to name but a few. The book 
may be used in part or as a whole to form an introductory course in either or both of the subject areas. The text is 
very much 'figure driven' as I believe that illustrations are extremely effective in conveying the concepts required 
for comprehension of the subject matter of the book. In addition, undue mathematical rigour is often avoided within 
the text in order to provide a concise treatment of specific concepts and speed the reader through the subject areas.
To allow the reader a steady progression through the book, without too much jumping about from chapter to 
chapter, I have attempted to order the topics within the text in as logical a sequence as possible. Chapter 1 provides 
a brief overview of both subject areas. The rest of the book is split into two parts: the first (chapters 2–4) deals with 
fractal geometry and its applications, while the second (chapters 5–7) tackles chaotic dynamics. Many of the 
methods of fractal geometry developed in the first half of the book will be used in the characterization (and 
comprehension) of the chaotic dynamical systems encountered in the second half of the book. Chapter 2 covers 
regular fractals while chapter 3 covers random fractals. Chapter 4 goes off at a slight tangent to investigate the 
fractal properties, and usefulness, of fractional Brownian motions (fBms). Initially conceived as one or two sections 
within chapter 3's coverage of random fractals, it soon became obvious that such an important topic deserved its 
own chapter. I believe that fBms have a lot to offer the scientific community, not least in the modelling of non-
Fickian diffusion and natural surface roughnesses. The absence of fBms, in any detail useful to the scientist or 
engineer, is conspicuous in many texts. However, the reader wanting to move quickly through the text from fractals 
to chaos may skip chapter 4. Chapter 5 deals with chaos in discrete dynamical systems. Chapter 6 covers chaos in 
continuous dynamical systems, and the tools necessary for the characterization of chaos are detailed in chapter 7. 
Among other things, chapter 7 links the fractal geometry of chapters 2 and 3 with the chaotic dynamics dealt with 
in chapters 5 and 6. In appendix A, a computer code for demonstrating chaos in the Lorenz equations is provided 
for use in the questions at the end of chapters 6 and 7. Appendix B illustrates the application of some of the 
techniques learned in chapters 6 and 7 to real experimental systems in which chaos has been observed. Seven 
systems are detailed briefly in this appendix and these are selected from a broad range of scientific and engineering 
areas.

The text is written at an elementary undergraduate level. It is based upon a university course, designed and run by 
myself, which may be taken by any student from a numerical discipline. The multidisciplinary nature of the topics 
within the book make it ideal for the basis of an elective course, with a university-wide appeal. In addition to 
undergraduate students, the book should also be of benefit to postgraduate students, researchers and practitioners in 
numerate disciplines who have no previous knowledge of the topics and who want a quick introductory overview at 
a reasonable mathematical level. An attempt has been made to relate the text to the reader's own area of interest, 
and to that end, a substantial further reading section is provided near the end of each chapter. These further reading 
sections should point the reader to more advanced sources of information specific to his or her own field of interest. 
Although I have included references from as many subject areas as possible, the literature is vast and diverse and 
there will inevitably be many omissions. I have, however, attempted to provide the more important historical 
references together with some of the more recent ones.
After the further reading section in each chapter there are revision questions and further tasks for the reader to 
attempt. The solutions are provided at the end of the book. Within the text itself, I have attempted to be as 
consistent with the nomenclature as possible; however, often this is not possible (especially in chapter 7) as many 
symbols have been used in the literature for historical reasons, and I have kept these in their traditional form. In 
addition, to assist the reader I have used italics for mathematical text, key phrases and quotations; bold for 
keywords; and underlining for emphasis (used sparingly).
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people who helped me in the completion of this book. I 
would like to thank David Low, David Tritton and Iain Lawson for taking the time to read over the draft manuscript 
and providing many helpful suggestions. I would like to thank Andrew Chan for his comments on the draft 
manuscript; for his Runge–Kutta routine used in the program in appendix A; and, not least, for his great help as a 
PhD supervisor when I first became involved in fractals and chaos many moons ago (or so it seems). Thanks are 
also due to Ron Hunter for his generous assistance in the drawing of some of the figures in chapters 2 and 3, and for 
his technical assistance which allowed me to draw many of the other figures in the book. In the same vein, thanks 
also to Peter McNeill and Donald Ross. Thank you to Jamie Watson who provided the algorithm for the generation 
of the DLA figure in chapter 4.
Special thanks to both my wife Stephanie for her support and encouragement during the writing of the text and my 
son Michael who, although he cannot speak as yet, encouraged me greatly with his gummy smiles (and latterly his 
sparsely toothed smiles). Special thanks also to my parents for their unending help and support during the writing 
of the text.

Introduction
The twin subjects of fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics have been behind an enormous change in the way 
scientists and engineers perceive, and subsequently model, the world in which we live. Chemists, biologists, 
physicists, physiologists, geologists, economists, and engineers (mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil, aeronautical 
etc) have all used methods developed in both fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics to explain a multitude of 
diverse physical phenomena: from trees to turbulence, cities to cracks, music to moon craters, measles epidemics, 
and much more. Many of the ideas within fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics have been in existence for a long 
time, however, it took the arrival of the computer, with its capacity to accurately and quickly carry out large 
repetitive calculations, to provide the tool necessary for the in-depth exploration of these subject areas. In recent 
years, the explosion of interest in fractals and chaos has essentially ridden on the back of advances in computer 
development.
The objective of this book is to provide an elementary introduction to both fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics. 
The book is split into approximately two halves: the first—chapters 2–4—deals with fractal geometry and its 
applications, while the second—chapters 5–7—deals with chaotic dynamics. Many of the methods developed in the 
first half of the book, where we cover fractal geometry, will be used in the characterization (and comprehension) of 
the chaotic dynamical systems encountered in the second half of the book. In the rest of this chapter brief 
introductions to fractal geometry and chaotic dynamics are given, providing an insight to the topics covered in 
subsequent chapters of the book.
1.2—
A Matter of Fractals
In recent years, the science of fractal geometry has grown into a vast area of knowledge, with almost all branches of 
science and engineering gaining from the new insights it has provided. Fractal geometry is concerned with the 
properties of fractal objects, usually simply known as fractals. Fractals may be found in nature or generated using a 
mathematical recipe. The word 'fractal' was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, sometimes referred to as the father of 
fractal geometry. Mandelbrot realized that it is very often

  
Page 2
impossible to describe nature using only Euclidean geometry, that is in terms of straight lines, circles, cubes, and 
such like. He proposed that fractals and fractal geometry could be used to describe real objects, such as trees, 
lightning, river meanders and coastlines, to name but a few.
There are many definitions of a fractal. Possibly the simplest way to define a fractal is as an object which appears 
self-similar under varying degrees of magnification. In effect, possessing symmetry across scale, with each small 
part of the object replicating the structure of the whole. This is perhaps the loosest of definitions, however, it 
captures the essential, defining characteristic, that of self-similarity. A diagram is possibly the best way to 
illustrate what is meant by a fractal object. Figure 1.1 contains sketches of two naturally occurring 'objects': an 
island coastline and a person. As we zoom into the coastline, we find that its ruggedness is repeated on finer and 
finer scales, and under rescaling looks essentially the same: the coastline is a fractal curve. The person, however, is 
not a self-similar object. As we zoom into various parts of the body, we see quite different forms. The hand does 
not resemble the whole body, the fingernail does not look like the hand and so on. Even viewing different parts of 
the body at the same scale, say the hand and the head, we would see that again they are not similar in form. We 
conclude that a person is not a fractal object. It is interesting to note at this stage that, although the body as a whole 
is not a fractal object, recent studies have attempted, with some success, to characterize certain parts of the body 
using fractal geometry, for example, the branching structure of the lung and the fine structure of the neuron (brain 
cell).
Figure 1.1.
Fractal and non-fractal objects.
Figure 1.2 contains four natural fractals: the boundary of clouds, wall cracks, a hillside silhouette and a fern. All 
four possess self-similarity. The first three natural fractals possess the same statistical properties (i.e. the same 
degree of ruggedness) as we zoom in. They possess statistical self-similarity. On the other hand, the fern 
possesses

exact self-similarity. Each frond of the fern is a mini-copy of the whole fern, and each frond branch is similar to 
the whole frond, and so on. In addition, as we move towards the top of the fern we see a smaller and smaller copy 
of the whole fern. The fractals of figure 1.2 require a two-dimensional (2D) plane to 'live in', that is all the points on 
them can be specified using only two co-ordinates. Put more formally, they have a Euclidean dimension of two. 
However, many natural fractals need a 3D world in which to exist. Take, for example, a tree whose branches weave 
through three dimensions; see the tree branching in 3D in figure 1.3 (if you can!). Fractals themselves have their 
own dimension, known as the fractal dimension, which is usually (but not always) a noninteger dimension that is 
greater than their topological dimension, DT, and less than their Euclidean dimension DE (see chapter 2). There are 
many definitions of fractal dimension and we shall encounter a number of them as we proceed through the text, 
including: the similarity dimension, DS; the divider dimension, DD; the Hausdorff dimension, DH; the box counting 
dimension, DB; the correlation dimension, DC; the information
