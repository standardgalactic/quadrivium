Foreword
Throughout the world, the Internet has brought tremendous new opportunities for 
individuals and their employers. Companies and other organizations are seeing dramatic 
increases in productivity by investing in robust networking capabilities. Some studies 
have shown measurable productivity improvements in entire economies. The promise 
of enhanced efﬁciency, proﬁtability, and standard of living is real and growing.
Such productivity gains aren’t achieved by simply purchasing networking equipment. 
Skilled professionals are needed to plan, design, install, deploy, conﬁgure, operate, 
maintain, and troubleshoot today’s networks. Network managers must assure that 
they have planned for network security and for continued operation. They need to 
design for the required performance level in their organization. They must implement 
new capabilities as the demands of their organization, and its reliance on the network, 
expands.
To meet the many educational needs of the internetworking community, Cisco Systems 
established the Cisco Networking Academy Program. The Networking Academy is a 
comprehensive learning program that provides students with the Internet technology 
skills essential in a global economy. The Networking Academy integrates face-to-face 
teaching, web-based content, online assessment, student performance tracking, hands-on 
labs, instructor training and support, and preparation for industry-standard certiﬁcations.
The Networking Academy continually raises the bar on blended learning and educational 
processes. The Internet-based assessment and instructor support systems are some of 
the most extensive and validated ever developed, including a 24/7 customer service 
system for Networking Academy instructors. Through community feedback and elec-
tronic assessment, the Networking Academy adapts the curriculum to improve outcomes 
and student achievement. The Cisco Global Learning Network infrastructure designed 
for the Networking Academy delivers a rich, interactive, and personalized curriculum 
to students worldwide. The Internet has the power to change the way people work, 
live, play, and learn, and the Cisco Networking Academy Program is in the forefront 
of this transformation.

Chapter 1
Introduction to Networking
This chapter presents the basics of computers and connection to the Internet. It also 
introduces different number systems and the processes used to convert a number from 
one number system to another.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and Photo-
Zooms that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements 
are designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this 
chapter.
The Fundamentals of Internet Connectivity
To understand the role that computers play in a networking system, consider the Internet.
The Internet can be thought of as a tree with computers as leaves. Computers are the 
sources and receivers of information by way of the Internet. Computers can function 
without the Internet, but the Internet cannot exist without computers. The Internet is 
growing rapidly, and users are becoming increasingly dependent on it for a myriad of 
services.
Computers, along with being an integral part of a network, also play a vital role in the 
world of work. Businesses use their computers for a variety of purposes, but they also use 
them in some common ways. They use servers to store important data to manage customer 
and employee accounts. They use spreadsheet software to organize ﬁnancial information, 
word processor software to maintain records and correspondence, and browsers to access 
internal and external websites.
High-speed accesses to the Internet, such as cable modem and DSL services, are now 
available to the home and small ofﬁce, which is increasing the demand for support ser-
vices. No longer satisﬁed with a single computer connected to the Internet, the consumer 
needs the tools to be able to share the connection.
1102.book  Page 5  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
The Internet is the largest data network in the world. The Internet consists of a multi-
tude of interconnected networks, both large and small. At the edge of this giant network 
is the individual consumer computer.
Connection to the Internet can be broken down into the following components:
■The physical connection—A physical connection to a network is made by con-
necting a specialized expansion card, such as a modem or a network interface 
card (NIC), to a PC with a cable. The physical connection is used to transfer 
signals between PCs in the local network and remote devices on the Internet.
■The logical connection—The logical connection uses standards called protocols. 
A protocol is a formal description of a set of rules and conventions that govern 
how devices on a network communicate. Connections to the Internet may use 
multiple protocols. The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/
IP) suite is the primary protocol used on the Internet. TCP/IP is a suite of proto-
cols that work together to send and receive data. You learn more about TCP/IP 
in Chapter 7, “TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing.”
■Applications—The application that interprets the data and displays the informa-
tion in a comprehensible format is the last part of the connection. Applications 
work with protocols to send and receive data across the Internet. A web browser
displays HTML as a web page. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used to download 
ﬁles and programs from the Internet. Web browsers also use proprietary plug-in 
applications to display special data types such as video, audio, and animation.
This introductory view might make the Internet seem like an overly simple process. 
However, as this topic is explored in greater depth later in this book, it will become 
apparent that sending data across the Internet is a complicated task.
PC Basics
Because computers are important building blocks in a network, it is important to be 
able to recognize and name the major components of a PC. Think of the internal com-
ponents of a PC as a network of devices, all attached to the system bus. In a sense, a 
PC is a small computer network.
Many networking devices, such as routers and switches, are special-purpose comput-
ers and have many of the same parts as normal PCs. For a computer to be a reliable 
means of obtaining information, it must be in good working order. You should be able 
to recognize, name, and state the purpose of the PC components (this information per-
tains to laptops as well) described in the following sections.

Electronic Components
Electronic components are unique in that they are designed to conduct or transmit 
data or signals in electronic form. Most electronic components are found on the 
motherboard and expansion cards that plug into the motherboard. Here are some 
of the parts that commonly are found on electronic components:
■Transistor—A device that ampliﬁes a signal or opens and closes a circuit. Micro-
processors can have millions of transistors.
■Integrated circuit (IC)—A device made of semiconductor material. It contains 
many transistors and performs a speciﬁc task.
■Resistor—A device that is made of material that opposes the ﬂow of electric 
current.
■Capacitor—An electronic component that stores energy in the form of an electro-
static ﬁeld. It consists of two conducting metal plates separated by an insulating 
material.
■Connector—A port or interface that a cable plugs into. Examples include serial, 
parallel, USB, and disk drive interfaces.
■Light emitting diode (LED)—A semiconductor device that emits light when a 
current passes through it. These are commonly used as indicator lights.
PC Components
PC components are typically thought of as packaged or add-on parts that provide 
additional functionality to a PC. This is in contrast to vital electronic components 
that are necessary in every PC. These include things such as media drives, memory, 
hard drives, processors, and the power supply. Here are some of the most common PC 
components:
■Printed circuit board (PCB)—A thin plate on which chips (integrated circuits) 
and other electronic components are placed. Examples include the motherboard 
and various expansion adapters.
■CD-ROM drive—An optical drive that can read information from a CD-ROM. 
This can also be a CD-RW (compact disc read-write) drive or a DVD (digital 
video disc) drive or a combination of all three in one drive.
■Central processing unit (CPU)—The “brain” of the computer, where most of the 
calculations take place (see Figure 1-1).
■Floppy disk drive—Can read and write to ﬂoppy disks (see Figure 1-2).
■Hard disk drive—Reads and writes data on a hard disk. The primary storage 
device in the computer.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
Figure 1-1 Central Processing Unit
Figure 1-2 Floppy Disk Drive
■Microprocessor—A silicon chip that contains a CPU. A typical PC has a number 
of microprocessors, including the main CPU.
■Motherboard—The computer’s main circuit board (see Figure 1-3). The mother-
board is crucial because it is the computer’s nerve center. Everything else in the 
system plugs into it, is controlled by it, and depends on it to communicate with 
other devices in the system.
■Bus—A collection of circuits through which data is transmitted from one part of 
a computer to another. The bus connects all the internal computer components 
to the CPU. The Industry-Standard Architecture (ISA) and the peripheral compo-
nent interconnect (PCI) are two types of buses.
■Random-access memory (RAM)—Also known as read-write memory, RAM can 
have new data written to it and can have stored data read from it. RAM is the 
main working area used by the CPU for most processing and operations. A draw-
back of RAM is that it requires electrical power to maintain data storage. If the 
computer is turned off or loses power, all data stored in RAM is lost unless the 
data was previously saved to disk. Memory boards with RAM chips plug into 
the motherboard.

Figure 1-3 Motherboard
■Read-only memory (ROM)—A type of computer memory in which data has 
been prerecorded. After data has been written onto a ROM chip, it cannot be 
removed and can only be read. A version of ROM known as EEPROM (electron-
ically erasable programmable read-only memory) can be written to. It is called 
Flash memory or ﬁrmware. The basic input/output system (BIOS) in most PCs is 
stored in EEPROM.
■Expansion slot—An opening in a computer, usually on the motherboard, where 
an expansion card can be inserted to add new capabilities to the computer (see 
Figure 1-4).
■System unit—The main component of the PC system. It includes the case, chassis, 
power supply, microprocessor, main memory, bus, expansion cards, disk drives 
(ﬂoppy, CD hard disk, and so on), and ports. The system unit does not include 
the keyboard, the monitor, or any other external devices connected to the computer.
■Power supply—Supplies power to a computer.

Motherboard Components
The motherboard is the computer’s main circuit board. It is crucial because it is the 
nerve center of the computer system. Everything else in the system plugs into it, is con-
trolled by it, and depends on it to communicate with other devices in the system. The 
following list describes the motherboard’s various components:
■Backplane—A large circuit board that contains sockets for expansion cards.
■Memory chips—RAM chips on memory cards plug into the motherboard.
■Network interface card (NIC)—A printed circuit board that provides network 
communication capabilities to and from a PC. Many newer desktop and laptop 
computers have an Ethernet NIC built into the motherboard.
■Video card—A board that plugs into a PC to give it display capabilities. Video 
cards typically include onboard microprocessors and additional memory to 
speed up and enhance graphics display.
■Sound card—An expansion board that handles all sound functions.
■Parallel port—An interface that can transfer more than 1 bit at a time. It is used 
to connect external devices, such as printers.
■Serial port—An interface used for serial communication in which only 1 bit is 
transmitted at a time. The serial port can connect to an external modem, plotter, 
or serial printer. It can also be used to connect to networking devices such as 
routers and switches as a console connection.
■Mouse port—Connects a mouse to a PC.
■Keyboard port—Connects a keyboard to a PC.
NOTE
Some computers have 
a network card, 
sound card, video 
card, and other cards 
integrated into the 
motherboard.

power to the device.
■Universal Serial Bus (USB) port—This interface lets peripheral devices such as 
mice, modems, keyboards, scanners, and printers be plugged in and unplugged 
without resetting the system. USB ports eventually might replace serial and paral-
lel ports.
Desktop Versus Laptop
Laptop and notebook computers are becoming increasingly popular. The main differ-
ence between desktop PCs and laptops, other than the fact that laptop components are 
smaller than those found in a PC, is that laptops offer more mobility and portability 
than desktop PCs. The expansion slots are called Personal Computer Memory Card 
International Association (PCMCIA) card slots or PC card slots in laptop computers. 
The PC card slots are where devices such as NICs, modems, hard drives, and other 
useful devices (usually the size of a thick credit card) are connected. Figure 1-5 shows 
a PC card adapter for a wireless local-area network (WLAN).

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
Network Interface Cards
As shown in Figure 1-6, a NIC is a printed circuit board that provides network com-
munication capabilities to and from a PC. Also called a LAN adapter, a NIC plugs into 
a motherboard and provides a port for connecting to the network. The NIC consti-
tutes the computer interface with the LAN.
Figure 1-6 Network Interface Card
The NIC communicates with the network through a cable and with the computer via an 
expansion slot. When a NIC is installed in a computer, it requires an interrupt request 
(IRQ) for service from the CPU, as well as an input/output (I/O) address, a memory 
space for the operating system (such as Linux or Windows), and drivers to perform its 
function. An IRQ is a signal that informs a CPU that an event needing its attention has 
occurred. An IRQ is sent over a hardware line to the microprocessor. An example of an 
interrupt being issued is a key being pressed on the keyboard. The CPU must move the 
character from the keyboard to RAM. An I/O address is a location in memory used to 
enter data into or retrieve data from a computer using an auxiliary device.
When selecting a NIC for a network, consider the following:
■Type of network—Different types of networks use different types of NICs. For 
example, Ethernet NICs are designed for Ethernet LANs. Some other types of 
networks include Token Ring and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). 
Ethernet is by far the most common.
■Type of medium—The type of port or connector used by the NIC for network 
connection is speciﬁc to the medium type, such as twisted-pair, coaxial, ﬁber-
optic, or wireless. Coaxial is becoming increasingly rare.

■Type of system bus—There are different types of system buses, such as PCI and 
ISA. Because PCI slots are faster than ISA slots, the latter are being phased out.
NIC and Modem Installation
Connectivity to the Internet requires an adapter card, which might be a modem or NIC.
A modem is an electronic device that is used for computer communications through 
telephone lines. It allows data transfer between one computer and another over the 
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Figure 1-7 shows an example of an 
external modem. Typically, modems send data in blocks of bytes. After each block, 
basic math is performed to analyze the block, and the computer on the receiving end is 
asked whether it agrees with the results. If any differences appear, the block is sent 
again. The modems convert digital data to analog signals for transmission over the 
PSTN and then convert analog signals back to digital data on the receiving end.
Figure 1-7 External Modem
The term modem derives from the function of this device. The process of converting 
digital signals to analog and back again is called modulation/demodulation (hence the 
term modem). Modems can be installed internally or attached to the computer via a 
serial or USB interface externally. Modems connect a computer to the network by dial-
ing the telephone number of another computer’s modem, typically that of the Internet 
service provider (ISP).
The NIC lets hosts connect to the network. The NIC is considered a key component. 
NICs are available in different types, depending on the individual device conﬁguration. 
Notebook computers can have a built-in interface or use a PCMCIA card. Desktop 
systems can use a built-in or adapter card-type NIC.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
Situations that require NIC installation include the following:
■Adding a NIC to a PC that does not already have one
■Replacing a bad or damaged NIC
■Upgrading from a 10-megabits per second (Mbps) NIC to a 10/100-Mbps NIC
To install a NIC, as shown in Figure 1-8, you need the following resources:
■Knowledge of how the adapter is conﬁgured, including jumpers and plug-and-play 
software. Most modern NICs do not require jumpers and are plug-and-play, 
requiring little or no conﬁguration. They can be conﬁgured using software that 
comes with the NIC if necessary.
■Use of network card diagnostics, including the vendor-supplied diagnostics and 
loopback test (see the card’s documentation).
■The ability to resolve hardware resource conﬂicts, including IRQ, I/O base 
address, and direct memory address (DMA), which is used to transfer data from 
RAM to a device without going through the CPU.

Overview of High-Speed and Dialup Connectivity
In the early 1960s, modems were introduced to provide data communications connec-
tivity for dumb terminals to a centrally based computer. Many companies rented com-
puter time because owning an onsite system was cost-prohibitive. The connection rate 
was very slow—300 bits per second (bps), which translates to about 30 characters per 
second.
As PCs became affordable in the 1970s, Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) appeared, 
allowing users to connect and post or read messages on a discussion board. Running at 
300 bps was acceptable, because this exceeds the speed at which most people can read 
or type. BBSs did not become widely used until the early 1980s, and the transfer of

Testing Connectivity with Ping
15
ﬁles and graphics began to be desirable. The 300 bps speed quickly became intolerable, 
and modem speeds started to increase. By the 1990s, modems were running at 9600 
bps. They reached the current standard of 56 kbps (56,000 bps) by 1998.
Inevitably, the high-speed services used in the corporate environment, such as digital 
subscriber line (DSL) and cable modem access, migrated to the consumer market. 
These services no longer required expensive equipment or a second phone line. They 
are also always-on services and therefore provide instant access that does not require a 
connection to be established for each session. This results in greater reliability and ﬂex-
ibility. It has also led to the ease of Internet connection sharing and small ofﬁce and 
home networks.
TCP/IP Conﬁguration
TCP/IP is a set of protocols or rules developed to allow cooperating computers to 
share resources across a network. A computer must be running the TCP/IP protocol 
suite to access the Internet. To enable TCP/IP on the workstation, it must be conﬁg-
ured using the operating system tools. The PC requires an IP address, subnet mask, 
default gateway, DNS (domain name server) information. These can be assigned man-
ually or obtained from a Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) server. The 
information necessary to conﬁgure TCP/IP on a computer is typically obtained from 
a network administrator or an ISP. The process is similar whether you’re using a 
Windows or Apple Macintosh operating system. TCP/IP, DHCP, and DNS are covered 
in subsequent chapters.
Testing Connectivity with Ping
Ping is a program that is useful for verifying a successful TCP/IP installation. It is named 
after the sonar operation used to locate and determine the distance to an underwater 
object. Ping stands for Packet Internet Groper.
The ping command works by sending multiple IP packets to a speciﬁed destination. 
Each packet sent is a request for a reply. The output response for a ping contains the 
success ratio and round-trip time to the destination. From this information, you can

stack and NIC transmit/receive function. Figure 1-9 shows the ping 127.0.0.1 test.
■ping IP address of host computer—Veriﬁes the TCP/IP address conﬁguration for 
the local host.
■ping default-gateway IP address—Veriﬁes whether the router that connects the 
local network to other networks can be accessed.
■ping remote destination IP address—Veriﬁes connectivity to a remote host.

Web Browsers and Plug-Ins
17
A web browser is software that interprets Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), one 
of the languages used to code web page content. Other markup languages, such as 
SGML and XML, provide more advanced features for creating dynamic and interac-
tive web pages than does HTML. HTML, the most common markup language, can 
display graphics and play sound, movies, and other multimedia ﬁles. Hyperlinks are 
computer program commands that point to other HTML ﬁles on a web server or other 
places in the same documents, which provide shortcuts to other web pages and ﬁles.
Two of the most popular web browsers are Internet Explorer (IE) and Netscape. Although
they are identical in the task they perform, there are differences between them. Some 
websites might not support the use of one or the other, so it can be beneﬁcial to have 
both programs installed on the computer.
Table 1-1 compares the characteristics of these two web browsers.
Standard web browsers cannot display many special, or proprietary, ﬁle types. To view 
these ﬁles, the browser must be conﬁgured to use plug-in applications. These applica-
tions work in conjunction with the browser to launch the program required to view 
the special ﬁles. Here are some of the more popular proprietary plug-ins:
■Flash Player/Shockwave Player—A plug-in that plays multimedia ﬁles created by 
Macromedia Flash.
■Adobe Acrobat Reader—A software program that allows the user to view and 
print Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) ﬁles.
■Windows Media Player—A software program that allows the user to play audio 
and video ﬁles.
■Quicktime—A software program created by Apple that allows the user to play 
video and audio ﬁles.
■Real Player—A software program that allows the user to play audio ﬁles.

Other Common Computer Applications
Computers perform many other useful tasks. In business, employees regularly use a set 
of applications that come in the form of an ofﬁce suite, such as Microsoft Ofﬁce or 
Lotus Smart Suite. Ofﬁce applications typically include the following:
■Spreadsheet software—An application that lets users construct spreadsheets 
consisting of columns and rows. It is often used with formulas to process and 
analyze data.
■A word processor—An application that lets users create and edit text documents. 
Modern word processors allow the user to create sophisticated documents that 
include graphics and richly formatted text.
■Database software—An application that lets users store, maintain, organize, sort, 
and ﬁlter records. A record is a collection of information identiﬁed by a common 
theme, such as a customer name.
■Presentation software—An application that lets users design and develop presen-
tations to deliver at meetings, classes, or sales presentations.
■Personal information managers—Applications that can include features such as 
e-mail, contact lists, a calendar, and a to-do list.

Bits, Bytes, and Measurement Terms
19
Binary Representation of Data
Computers are electromechanical devices made up of electronic switches. At the lowest 
levels of computation, computers depend on these electronic switches to make decisions. 
As such, computers react only to electrical impulses. These impulses are understood by 
the computer as either on or off states (1s or 0s).
Computers work with and store data using electronic switches that are either on or off. 
Computers can only understand and use data that is in this two-state (binary) format. 
1 represents an on state, and 0 represents an off state. These 1s and 0s represent the 
two possible states of an electronic component in a computer. These 1s and 0s are 
called binary digits or bits.
The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), the most com-
monly used code for representing alphanumeric data in a computer, uses binary digits 
to represent the symbols typed on the keyboard. When computers send on/off states 
over a network, electricity, light, or radio waves represent the 1s and 0s. Each charac-
ter has a unique pattern of eight binary digits assigned to represent the character.
Bits, Bytes, and Measurement Terms
Bits are binary digits. They are either 0s or 1s. In a computer, they are represented by 
on/off switches or the presence or absence of electrical charges, light pulses, or radio 
waves.
For example:
■A binary 0 might be represented by 0 volts of electricity (0 = 0 volts).
■A binary 1 might be represented by +5 volts of electricity (1 = +5 volts).
Computers are designed to use groupings of 8 bits. This grouping of 8 bits is called a 
byte. In a computer, 1 byte represents a single addressable storage location. These stor-
age locations represent a value or a single character of data, such as an ASCII code. 
The total number of combinations of the eight switches being turned on and off is 256 
(or 28). The value range of a byte is from 0 to 255. So, a byte is an important concept 
to understand when working with computers and networks.
Most computer coding schemes use 8 bits to represent each number, letter, or symbol. 
A series of 8 bits is called a byte; 1 byte represents a single addressable storage location 
(see Table 1-2).

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
The following are commonly used computer measurement terms:
■Bit—The smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit equals 1 or 0, and it is the 
binary format in which data is processed, stored, and transmitted by computers.
■Byte—A unit of measure used to describe the size of a data ﬁle, the amount of 
space on a disk or another storage medium, or the amount of data being sent 
over a network. 1 byte equals 8 bits of data.
■Kb (kilobit)—Approximately 1000 bits.
■KB (kilobyte)—Approximately 1000 bytes (1024 bytes exactly).
■Mb (megabit)—Approximately 1 million bits.
■MB (megabyte)—Approximately 1 million bytes (1,048,576 bytes exactly). 
A megabyte is sometimes called a “meg.” The amount of RAM in most PCs is 
typically measured in MB. Large ﬁles are often some number of MB in size.
■GB (gigabyte)—Approximately 1 billion bytes. A gigabyte is sometimes called a 
“gig.” Hard drive capacity on most PCs is typically measured in GB.
■TB (terabyte)—Approximately 1 trillion bytes. Hard drive capacity on some 
high-end computers is measured in TB.
■kbps (kilobits per second)—One thousand bits per second. This is a standard 
measurement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection.
■kBps (kilobytes per second)—One thousand bytes per second. This is a standard 
measurement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection.

ber to do the proper 
calculations when 
comparing transmis-
sion speeds that are 
measured in KB with 
those measured in Kb. 
For example, modem 
software usually shows 
the connection speed 
in kilobits per second 
(for example, 45 kbps). 
However, popular 
browsers display ﬁle-
download speeds in 
kilobytes per second. 
This means that with 
a 45-kbps connec-
tion, the download 
speed would be a 
maximum of 5.76 
kBps. In practice, 
this download speed 
cannot be reached 
because of other fac-
tors that consume 
bandwidth at the 
same time. Also, ﬁle 
sizes are typically 
expressed in bytes, 
whereas LAN band-
width and WAN 
links are typically 
expressed in kilobits 
per second (kbps) or 
Megabits per second 
(Mbps). You must 
multiply the number 
of bytes in the ﬁle by 
8 to determine the 
amount of bandwidth 
consumed in bps.

21
■Mbps (megabits per second)—One million bits per second. This is a standard 
measurement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection. Basic 
Ethernet operates at 10 Mbps.
■MBps (megabytes per second)—One million bytes per second. This is a standard 
measurement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection.
■Gbps (gigabits per second)—One billion bits per second. This is a standard mea-
surement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection. 10G or 
10 Gigabit Ethernet operates at 10 Gbps.
■Tbps (terabits per second)—One trillion bits per second. This is a standard mea-
surement of the amount of data transferred over a network connection. Some 
high-speed core Internet routers and switches operate at more than Tbps.
■Hz (hertz)—A unit of frequency. It is the rate of change in the state or cycle in a 
sound wave, alternating current, or other cyclical waveform. It represents one 
cycle per second.
■MHz (megahertz)—One million cycles per second. This is a common measure-
ment of the speed of a processing chip, such as a computer microprocessor. Some 
cordless phones operate in this range (for example, 900 MHz).
■GHz (gigahertz)—One thousand million, or 1 billion (1,000,000,000), cycles per 
second. This is a common measurement of the speed of a processing chip, such as 
a computer microprocessor. Some cordless phones and wireless LANs operate in 
this range (for example, 802.11b at 2.4 GHz).
Because computers are designed to work with on/off switches, binary digits and binary 
numbers are natural to them. However, humans use the decimal number system in 
their daily lives. It is hard to remember the long series of 1s and 0s that computers use. 
Therefore, the computer’s binary numbers need to be converted to decimal numbers.
Sometimes, binary numbers need to be converted to hexadecimal (hex) numbers. This 
is done because hex numbers can represent a long string of binary digits with just a 
few hexadecimal digits. This makes it easier to remember and work with the numbers.
Base 10 Number System
A number system consists of symbols and rules for using those symbols. Many number 
systems exist. The number system used most frequently is the decimal, or Base10, 
number system. It is called Base10 because it uses ten symbols. These ten symbols are 
the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Combinations of these digits can represent all 
possible numeric values, as documented in Table 1-3.
NOTE
PC processors are get-
ting faster all the time. 
The microprocessors 
used in PCs in the 
1980s typically ran at 
less than 10 MHz (the 
original IBM PC was 
4.77 MHz). Currently, 
PC processors are 
pushing speeds up to 
3 GHz, with faster 
processors being devel-
oped for the future.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
The decimal number system is based on powers of 10. The value of each column posi-
tion from right to left is multiplied by the number 10 (the base number) raised to a 
power (exponent). The power that 10 is raised to depends on its position to the left 
of the decimal point. When a decimal number is read from right to left, the ﬁrst (right-
most) position represents 100 (1), and the second position represents 101 (10 ∗1 = 10). 
The third position represents 102 (10 ∗ 10 = 100). The seventh position to the left rep-
resents 106 (10 × 10 ∗ 10 ∗ 10 ∗ 10 ∗ 10 = 1,000,000). This is true no matter how 
many columns the number has.
For example:
2134 = (2 ∗ 103) + (1 ∗ 102) + (3 ∗ 101) + (4 ∗ 100)
There is a 4 in the ones position, a 3 in the tens position, a 1 in the hundreds position, 
and a 2 in the thousands position. This example seems obvious when the decimal num-
ber system is used. Seeing exactly how the decimal system works is important, because 
it is needed for you to understand two other number systems, binary (Base2) and hexa-
decimal (Base16). These systems use the same methods as the decimal system. Human-
readable IP addresses are expressed in Base10 (decimal). The IP address 172.16.14.188 
is made up of four decimal numbers separated by dots or periods.
Base 2 Number System
Computers recognize and process data using the binary, or Base2, number system. The 
binary number system uses only two symbols (0 and 1) instead of the ten symbols used 
in the decimal, or Base10, number system. The position, or place, of each digit repre-
sents the number 2 (the base number) raised to a power (exponent) based on its posi-
tion (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and so on), as documented in Table 1-4.

Example:
10110 = (1 ∗ 24 = 16) + (0 ∗ 23 = 0) + (1 ∗ 22 = 4) + (1 ∗ 21 = 2) + (0 ∗ 20 = 0) 
= (16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0) = 22
If the binary number (10110) is read from left to right, there is a 1 in the 16s position, 
a 0 in the 8s position, a 1 in the 4s position, a 1 in the 2s position, and a 0 in the 1s 
position, which adds up to decimal number 22. Machine-readable IP addresses are 
expressed as a string of 32 bits (binary).
Base 16 Number System
The Base16, or hexadecimal (hex), number system is used frequently when working 
with computers because it can represent binary numbers in a more readable form. The 
computer performs computations in binary, but there are several instances in which a 
computer’s binary output is expressed in hexadecimal form to make it easier to read.
The hexadecimal number system uses 16 symbols. Combinations of these symbols can 
represent all possible numbers. Because only ten symbols represent digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and because Base16 requires six more symbols, the extra symbols are 
the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. The A represents the decimal number 10, B represents 
11, C represents 12, D represents 13, E represents 14, and F represents 15, as shown in 
Table 1-5.
The position of each symbol (digit) in a hex number represents the base number 16 
raised to a power (exponent) based on its position. Moving from right to left, the ﬁrst 
position represents 160 (or 1), the second position represents 161 (or 16), the third 
position represents 162 (or 256), and so on. Network adapter or NIC addresses are 
expressed as a string of 12 hexadecimal characters.

Decimal-to-Binary Conversion
You can convert decimal numbers to binary numbers in many different ways. The 
ﬂowchart shown in Figure 1-10 describes one method. This process involves trying to 
ﬁgure out which values of the power of 2 are added together to get the decimal num-
ber being converted. This method is one of several that can be used. It is best to select 
one method and practice with it until it always produces the correct answer.
Here’s an example:
These steps convert the decimal number 168 to binary:
Step 1
128 ﬁts into 168, so the leftmost bit in the binary number is a 1.
168 – 128 = 40
Step 2
64 does not ﬁt into 40, so the second bit from the left is a 0.
Step 3
32 ﬁts into 40, so the third bit from the left is a 1.
40 – 32 = 8
Step 4
16 does not ﬁt into 8, so the fourth bit from the left is a 0.
Step 5
8 ﬁts into 8, so the ﬁfth bit from the left is a 1.
8 – 8 = 0, so the remaining bits to the right are all 0s.
Step 6
As a result, the binary equivalent of the decimal value 168 is 10101000.
For more practice, try converting decimal 255 to binary. The answer should be 
11111111.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
This ﬂowchart works for decimal numbers of 255 or less. It yields an eight-digit binary 
number. This is appropriate for translating decimal IP addresses. Larger numbers can 
be converted by starting with the highest power of 2 that ﬁts. For example, the number 
650 can be converted by ﬁrst subtracting 512. This yields a ten-digit binary number.
Binary-to-Decimal Conversion
As with decimal-to-binary conversion, there is usually more than one way to solve the 
conversion. The ﬂowchart in Figure 1-11 shows one example.
Binary numbers can also be converted to decimal numbers by multiplying the binary 
digits by the base number of the system (Base2) raised to the exponent of its position.
Here’s an example:
Convert the binary number 01110000 to a decimal number.
0 ∗ 20 = 0
+
0 ∗ 21 = 0
+
0 ∗ 22 = 0
+
0 ∗ 23 = 0
+
1 ∗ 24 = 16
+
1 ∗ 25 = 32
+
1 ∗ 26 = 64
+
0 ∗ 27 = 0

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
As with the ﬂowchart shown in Figure 1-10, the ﬂowchart shown in Figure 1-11 also 
works for decimal numbers of 255 or less that start with an eight-digit binary number. 
Larger binary numbers can be converted by increasing the power of 2 for each bit on 
the right. For example, if you have a ten-digit binary number, the tenth digit is worth 
512, and the ninth is worth 256 if they are turned on (have a value of 1).
Hexadecimal and Binary Conversion
Converting a hexadecimal number to binary form and vice versa is a common task 
when dealing with the conﬁguration register in Cisco routers. Cisco routers have a 
conﬁguration register that is 16 bits long. That 16-bit binary number can be repre-
sented as a four-digit hexadecimal number. For example, 0010000100000010 in 
binary equals 2102 in hex.
Layer 2 Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are typically written in hex. For 
Ethernet and Token Ring, these addresses are 48 bits, or six octets (one octet is 1 byte). 
(“Oct” comes from the Greek word for eight.) Because these addresses consist of six 
distinct octets, they can be expressed as 12 hex numbers instead. Every 4 bits is a hex 
digit (24 = 16), as you will see in Table 1-6 in a moment.
Instead of writing
10101010.11110000.11000001.11100010.01110111.01010001
you can write the much-shorter hex equivalent:
AA.F0.C1.E2.77.51.
To make handling hex versions of MAC addresses even easier, the dots are placed only 
after every four hex digits, as in AAF0.C1E2.7751.
The most common way for computers and software to express hexadecimal output is 
by using 0x in front of the hexadecimal number. Thus, whenever you see 0x, you know 
that the number that follows is a hexadecimal number. For example, 0x1234 means 
1234 in base 16.
Like the binary and decimal number systems, the hexadecimal system is based on the 
use of symbols, powers, and positions. The symbols that hex uses are 0 through 9 and 
A through F. Table 1-6 shows the binary and decimal equivalents of hex digits.
Binary-to-Decimal Conversion
In this exercise, you practice converting binary values to decimal values.

To convert from hexadecimal to binary, convert every hex digit into 4 bits. For example, 
to convert hex AC (0xAC) to binary, you ﬁrst convert hex A, which is 1010 binary, and 
then you convert hex C, which is 1100 binary. So hex AC is 10101100 in binary.
Notice that all possible combinations of four binary digits have only one hexadecimal 
symbol, whereas two symbols are required for decimal. The reason why hex is used is 
that two hexadecimal digits can efﬁciently represent any combination of eight binary 
digits (as opposed to decimal, which would require up to four digits). In allowing two 
decimal digits to represent 4 bits, using decimal could also cause confusion in reading 
a value. For example, the eight bit binary number 01110011 would be 115 if con-
verted to decimal digits. Does this represent 11-5 or 1-15? If 11-5 is used, the binary 
number would be 10110101, which is not the number originally converted. Using 
hexadecimal, the conversion is 1F, which always converts back to 00011111.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
The best way to think about hexadecimal is to think of it as a shorthand way of read-
ing binary. It reduces an 8-bit number to just two hex digits. This reduces the confu-
sion of reading long strings of binary numbers and the amount of space it takes to 
write them. Remember that hexadecimal is sometimes abbreviated as 0x, so hex 5D 
might be written as 0x5D.
To convert from hex to binary, simply expand each hex digit into its 4-bit binary 
equivalent.
Four-Octet Dotted-Decimal Representation of a 32-Bit Binary 
Number
Currently, addresses assigned to computers on the Internet (IP addresses) are 32-bit 
binary numbers. To make it easier to work with these addresses, the 32-bit binary 
number is broken into a series of decimal numbers. To do this, split the binary number 
into four groups of eight binary digits. Then convert each group of 8 bits (an octet) 
into its decimal equivalent. Do this conversion exactly as was shown in the section, 
“Binary-to-Decimal Conversion.”
When written, the complete decimal number is represented as four groups of decimal 
digits separated by periods, such as 10.15.129.201. This is called dotted-decimal nota-
tion and provides a compact, easy-to-remember way of referring to 32-bit addresses. 
This representation is used frequently later in this course, so be sure to understand it. 
When converting to binary from dotted decimal, remember that each group of from 
one to three decimal digits represents a group of eight binary digits. If the decimal 
number you are converting is less than 128, you need to add 0s to the left of the equiv-
alent binary number until you have a total of 8 bits.
For example, to convert the dotted-decimal value 10.15.129.201 to its binary equiva-
lent, you should write the number as 00001010.00001111.10000001.11001001.
Boolean Logic
Boolean logic is based on digital circuitry that accepts one or two incoming voltages 
and, based on these input voltages, generates an output voltage. For the purpose of 
computers, the voltage difference is associated with two states, on and off. These two 
states are in turn represented by a 1 or a 0, which are the two digits in the binary num-
ber system.
Hexadecimal Conversion
In this exercise, you practice converting hexadecimal values to decimal and 
binary values.

Boolean logic is a binary logic that allows two numbers to be compared, and then a 
choice based on those two numbers is generated. These choices are the logical AND, 
OR, and NOT. With the exception of the NOT, Boolean operations have the same func-
tion. They accept two numbers (1 or 0) and generate a result based on the logic rule.
This section presents the operations, starting with the NOT operation. The next sec-
tion provides an example of directly applying Boolean logic in networking—network 
masking. This example covers the AND operation.
The NOT operation, as shown in Table 1-7, simply takes whatever value is presented 
(0 or 1) and inverts it. A 1 becomes a 0, and a 0 becomes a 1. Remember that the logic 
gates are electronic devices built speciﬁcally for this purpose. This is the logic rule that 
they follow; whatever is input, the opposite is output.
The AND operation, as shown in Table 1-8, takes two input values. If both values are 
1, the logic gate generates a 1 output; otherwise, it outputs a 0. There are four combi-
nations of input values. Three combinations generate a 0, and one combination gener-
ates a 1. The AND operation is used extensively with IP addressing and subnet masks.
The OR operation, as shown in Table 1-9, also takes two input values. If one value is 1 
or both values are 1, the output is 1. Just like the AND operation, there are four com-
binations of input values. However, in an OR operation, three of the combinations 
generate a 1 output, and one combination generates a 0 output.
The two networking operations that use Boolean logic are subnetwork masking and 
wildcard masking. Masking operations provide a way to ﬁlter addresses. The addresses 
identify the devices on the network. Masking allows the addresses to be grouped or 
controlled by other network operations.

Chapter 1: Introduction to Networking
IP Addresses and Subnet Masks
The 32-bit binary addresses used on the Internet are called Internet Protocol (IP)
addresses. This section covers the relationship between IP addresses and network 
masks. You learn more about IP addresses in Chapter 7.
When IP addresses are assigned to computers, some of the bits on the left side of the 
32 bit IP number are used to represent a network. The number of bits designated depends 
on the address class. The bits left over in the 32-bit IP address identify a particular 
computer on the network. A computer is called a host. So a computer’s IP address 
usually consists of a network portion and a host portion that represents a particular 
computer on a particular network.
For the computer to know how the 32-bit IP address has been split, a second 32-bit 
number called a subnetwork mask is used. This mask is a guide that indicates how the 
IP address should be interpreted by identifying how many of the bits identify the com-
puter’s network. The network mask sequentially ﬁlls in the 1s from the left side of the 
mask. A subnetwork mask is always all 1s until the network address is identiﬁed. Then 
it is all 0s from there to the mask’s rightmost bit. The bits in the IP address that are 0 
identify the computer (host) on that network. Some examples of subnet masks follow.
Example 1:
11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 written in dotted decimal is 255.0.0.0.
Example 2:
11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 written in dotted decimal is 
255.255.0.0.
In the ﬁrst example, the ﬁrst 8 bits from the left are the network address, and the last 
24 bits are the host address. In the second example, the ﬁrst 16 bits are the network 
address, and the last 16 bits are the host address.
Converting the IP address 10.34.23.134 to binary results in the following:
00001010.00100010.00010111.10000110

Summary
33
To determine the network portion of the IP address, compare the subnet mask bits 
to all 32 bits of the IP address 1 bit at a time, using the AND process, and record the 
result. The combination of a 0 IP address bit and a 0 mask bit is a 0. The combination 
of a 0 and a 1 is a 0. The combination of a 1 and a 1 is a 1. To better demonstrate, 
consider the following examples:
Example 1: Using the ﬁrst mask (255.0.0.0):
00001010.00100010.00010111.10000110: IP address
11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000: network mask
00001010.00000000.00000000.00000000 is the network part of the address. 
In dotted-decimal format, 10.0.0.0 is the network portion of the IP address.
Example 2: Using the second mask (255.255.0.0):
00001010.00100010.00010111.10000110: IP address
11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000: network mask
00001010.00100010.00000000.00000000 is the network part of the address. 
In dotted-decimal format, 10.34.0.0 is the network portion of the IP address.
The importance of subnetwork masking will become much clearer as you work more 
with IP addresses. For now, it is only important that you understand the concept of the 
network mask.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Data Networks
Data networks developed as a result of businesses and government agencies needing to 
exchange electronic information across long distances. At the time, microcomputers 
were not connected as mainframe computer terminals were, so there was no efﬁcient 
way of sharing data between multiple microcomputers. Figure 2-1 illustrates a com-
pany with many microcomputers without a network connection.
Figure 2-1 Company with Many Standalone Computers
Figure 2-2 Sneakernet
NOTE
In the early days, a 
company invested in 
computers as stand-
alone devices that 
sometimes had print-
ers attached. When 
employees who didn’t 
have a printer wanted 
to print documents, 
they had to copy a ﬁle 
to a ﬂoppy disk, carry 
it over and load it on 
to a coworker’s PC 
that was connected 
to a printer, and print 
it from there. This 
rather crude version 
of a network became 
known as sneakernet
(see Figure 2-2).
1102.book  Page 44  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

45
It became apparent that sharing data through the use of ﬂoppy disks was not an efﬁ-
cient or cost-effective manner in which to conduct business. Each time a ﬁle was mod-
iﬁed, it had to be shared again with all the other people who needed it. If two people 
modiﬁed the ﬁle and then tried to share it, one of the sets of changes would be lost.
Businesses needed a solution that would address the following concerns:
■How to avoid duplication of equipment and resources
■How to communicate efﬁciently
■How to set up and manage a network
Businesses realized that networking technology could increase productivity while 
saving money. Networks were added and expanded almost as rapidly as new network 
technologies and products were introduced. In the early 1980s, networking saw a 
tremendous expansion, even though the early development of networking was chaotic.
The network technologies that emerged in the mid-1980s were created with a variety 
of hardware and software. Each company that created network hardware and soft-
ware used its own company standards that were developed because of competition 
with other companies. Consequently, many new network technologies were incompat-
ible with each other. It became increasingly difﬁcult for networks that used different 
speciﬁcations to communicate with each other. This often required the old network 
equipment to be removed to implement the new equipment.
One early solution was the creation of local-area network (LAN) standards. Because 
LAN standards provided an open set of guidelines for creating network hardware and 
software, the capability to mix and match different equipment manufactured by different 
companies facilitated stability in LAN implementation. Figure 2-3 shows a simple LAN.
As the use of computers in businesses grew, it soon became obvious that even LANs 
were insufﬁcient. In a LAN system, each department or company is a kind of elec-
tronic island, as shown in Figure 2-4.
Before LANs were created, there was a need for information to move efﬁciently and 
quickly—not only within a company, but also from one business to another. The solu-
tion was the creation of metropolitan-area networks (MANs) and wide-area networks 
(WANs). Because WANs could connect user networks over large geographic areas, 
they made it possible for businesses to communicate with each other across great dis-
tances, as shown in Figure 2-5.

Computer Networking History
The history of computer networking is complex, involving many people from all over 
the world over the past 35 years. Table 2-1 presents a simpliﬁed view of how the Internet 
evolved. The processes of invention and commercialization are far more complicated, but
it is helpful to look at the fundamental development.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
In the 1940s, computers were large electromechanical devices that were prone to failure. 
In 1947, the invention of a semiconductor transistor opened up many possibilities for 
making smaller, more-reliable computers. In the 1950s, mainframe computers, run by 
punched-card programs, began to be used by large institutions. In the late 1950s, the 
integrated circuit was invented. It combined several—and then many, and now millions—
of transistors on one small piece of semiconductor. Through the 1960s, mainframes 
with terminals were commonplace, and integrated circuits were widely used.
In the late 1960s and 1970s, smaller computers called minicomputers (even though 
they were still very large by today’s standards) came into existence. In 1977, Apple 
Computer introduced the microcomputer, also known as the personal computer (PC). 
In 1981, IBM introduced its ﬁrst PC. The user-friendly Apple Macintosh, the open-
architecture IBM PC, and the further microminiaturization of integrated circuits led 
to widespread use of PCs in homes and businesses.
In the mid-1980s, computer users using standalone computers started sharing data 
(ﬁles) through the use of a modem connected to another computer. This was called 
point-to-point or dialup communication. This concept was expanded by the use of 
computers that were the central point of communication in a dialup connection. These 
computers were called bulletin boards. Users would connect to the bulletin board, 
leave and pick up messages, and upload and download ﬁles. The drawback of this type 
of system was that there was very little, if any, direct communication, and then only 
with those who knew about the bulletin board. Another limitation was that the bulle-
tin board computer required one modem per connection. If ﬁve people connected 
simultaneously, ﬁve modems connected to ﬁve separate phone lines were required. 
Imagine if 500 people wanted to connect at the same time!

Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1990s, the U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD) developed large, reliable WANs for military and scientiﬁc reasons. 
This technology was different from the point-to-point communication used in bulletin 
boards. It allowed multiple computers to be connected using many different paths. The 
network itself determined how to move data from one computer to another. Instead of 
being able to communicate with only one other computer at a time, many computers 
could be reached using the same connection. The DoD’s WAN eventually became the 
Internet.
Network Protocols
Protocol suites are collections of protocols that enable network communication from 
one host through the network to another host. A protocol is a formal description of a 
set of rules and conventions that govern a particular aspect of how devices on a net-
work communicate. Protocols determine the format, timing, sequencing, and error 
control in data communication. Without protocols, the computer cannot create or 
rebuild the stream of incoming bits from another computer into the original data.
Protocols control all aspects of data communication. They determine how the physical 
network is built, how computers connect to the network, how the data is formatted 
for transmission, and how that data is sent. These network rules are created and main-
tained by many different organizations and committees:
■Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)
■American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
■Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
■Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA)
■International Telecommunications Union (ITU), formerly known as the CCITT 
(Comité Consultatif International Téléphonique et Télégraphique)
Local-Area Networks (LANs)
LANs consist of computers, network interface cards, peripheral devices, networking 
media, and network devices. Figure 2-6 illustrates a LAN.
LANs make it possible for businesses that use computer technology to locally share 
ﬁles and printers efﬁciently and make internal communications possible, such as e-mail. 
LANs tie together data, local communications, and computing equipment.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals

LANs are designed to do the following:
■Operate within a limited geographic area
■Allow many users to access high-bandwidth media
■Provide full-time connectivity to local services
■Connect physically adjacent devices
Some common LAN technologies are
■Ethernet
■Token Ring
■FDDI
Wide-Area Networks (WANs)
WANs interconnect LANs, which then provide access to computers or ﬁle servers in 
other locations. Because WANs connect user networks over a large geographic area, as 
shown in Figure 2-7, they make it possible for businesses to communicate across great 
distances.

Figure 2-7 WAN
Using WANs allows computers, printers, and other devices on a LAN to share and be 
shared with distant locations. WANs provide instant communications across large geo-
graphic areas. The ability to send an instant message (IM) to someone anywhere in the 
world provides the same communication capabilities that used to be possible only if 
people were in the same physical ofﬁce. Collaboration software provides access to 
real-time information and resources that allow meetings to be held remotely instead of 
in person. Wide-area networking has also created a new class of workers called tele-
commuters—people who never have to leave home to go to work.
WANs are designed to do the following:
■Operate over large, geographically separated areas
■Allow users to engage in real-time communication with other users
■Provide full-time remote resources connected to local services
■Provide e-mail, World Wide Web, ﬁle transfer, and e-commerce services
Here are some common WAN technologies:
■Modems
■Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
■Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs)
A MAN is a network that spans a metropolitan area, such as a city or a suburban area. 
MANs are networks that connect LANs separated by distance and that are located 
within a common geographic area, as shown in Figure 2-8. For example, a bank with 
multiple branches might use a MAN. Typically, a service provider connects two or 
more LAN sites using private communication lines or optical services. A MAN also 
can be created using wireless bridge technology by beaming signals across public areas. 
The higher optical bandwidths that are currently available make MANs a more func-
tional and economically feasible option than in the past.
The following features differentiate MANs from LANs and WANs:
■MANs interconnect users in a geographic area or region larger than that covered 
by a LAN but smaller than the area covered by a WAN.
■MANs connect networks in a city into a single larger network (which can then 
also offer efﬁcient connection to a WAN).
■MANs also are used to interconnect several LANs by bridging them with back-
bone lines.
More Information: Emerging Home Networking Applications 
People now design and build their homes to be Internet homes, wiring them for Ethernet con-
nectivity. People integrate their computer(s) with their phone system, security system, home 
theater system, heating and air conditioning, lighting, and other electronic components to be 
able to control them all with the click of a mouse or even via a voice command.
Service providers have built cellular- and satellite-based carrier networks that offer sophisticated 
services, such as wireless Internet access. Local exchange carriers (LECs) (commonly known as 
local telephone companies) are implementing high-speed services for data transfer, such as DSL 
services, at a cost low enough to market to home users. Many cable operators, in addition to 
cable TV, now provide high-speed Internet access that can be shared among networked home 
computers. Cisco products support the latest wireless, DSL, and cable technologies.
People also are integrating PC, telephone, and fax capabilities, allowing for automatic answer-
ing and message storage and retrieval via computer. In addition, the Internet phone, which 
uses IP telephony technology and Voice over IP (VoIP), allows people to bypass telephone lines 
entirely with an Internet connection through cable, wireless, or some other medium to make 
long distance calls without paying long distance charges.

Specialized Networks Located Within the LAN
There are times when smaller and more specialized networks might reside within the 
LAN. Most notably, these specialized networks are used for access to storage systems, 
data center technology systems and devices, intranets or extranets, and VPNs. These 
various specialized networks are covered in this section.
Storage-Area Networks (SANs)
A storage-area network (SAN) is a dedicated, high-performance network that moves 
data between servers and storage resources. Because it is a separate dedicated network, 
it avoids any trafﬁc conﬂict between clients and servers, as shown in Figure 2-9.
SAN technology allows high-speed server-to-storage, storage-to-storage, or server-to-
server connectivity. This method uses a separate network infrastructure that relieves 
any problems associated with existing network connectivity.
SANs offer the following features:
■Performance—SANs enable concurrent access to disk or tape arrays by two or 
more servers at high speeds, providing enhanced system performance.
■Availability—SANs have disaster tolerance built in, because data can be mirrored 
using a SAN up to 10 kilometers (km) (6.2 miles) away.
■Scalability—Like a LAN/WAN, a SAN can use a variety of technologies. This 
allows easy relocation of backup data operations, ﬁle migration, and data repli-
cation between systems.

Data Center Technology
A data center, as shown in Figure 2-10, is a globally coordinated network of devices 
designed to accelerate the delivery of information over the Internet infrastructure. By 
taking advantage of services in the core IP network, enterprises and service providers 
can accelerate and improve the use of rich content such as broadband streaming media. 
Data center technology improves network performance and eliminates the need to 
stream media on the infrastructure.
A data center bypasses potential sources of congestion by distributing the load across a 
collection of content engines that are located close to the viewing audience. Rich web 
and multimedia content is copied to the content engines, and users are routed to an 
optimally located content engine.

Figure 2-10 Data Center
For example, when downloading a movie from an Internet service provider (ISP), 
instead of waiting for hours for the big movie ﬁle to download, the same movie might 
take only minutes to download if the ISP is using data center technology, because a 
data center can accelerate the delivery of information.
Intranets and Extranets
One common conﬁguration of a LAN is an intranet. Intranet web servers differ from 
public web servers in that the public does not have access to an organization’s intranet 
without the proper permissions and passwords. Intranets are designed to be accessed 
by users who have access privileges to an organization’s internal LAN. Within an 
intranet, web servers are installed in the network, and browser technology is used as 
the common front end to access information such as ﬁnancial data or graphical, text-
based data stored on those servers.
An extranet is an intranet that is partially accessible to authorized outsiders. Whereas 
an intranet resides behind a ﬁrewall and is accessible only to people who are members 
of the same company or organization, an extranet provides various levels of accessibil-
ity to outsiders. You can access an extranet only if you have a valid username and 
password, and your identity determines which parts of the extranet you can view. 
Extranets help extend the reach of applications and services that are intranet-based but 
that employ extended, secure access to external users or enterprises. This access is usu-
ally accomplished through passwords, user IDs, and other application-level security. 
Therefore, an extranet is the extension of two or more intranet strategies with a secure 
interaction between participant enterprises and their respective intranets. The extranet

maintains control of access to the intranets within each enterprise in the deployment. 
Extranets link customers, suppliers, partners, or communities of interest to a corporate 
intranet over a shared infrastructure using dedicated connections.
Figure 2-11 illustrates an intranet and an extranet.
Figure 2-11 Intranet and Extranet
Virtual Private Networks
A virtual private network (VPN) is a private network that is constructed within a 
public network infrastructure such as the global Internet. For example, using a VPN, 
a telecommuter can access the company headquarters’ network through the Internet 
by building a secure tunnel between the telecommuter’s PC and a VPN router in the 
headquarters.
Cisco products support the latest in VPN technology. A VPN is a service that offers 
secure, reliable connectivity over a shared public network infrastructure such as the 
Internet. VPNs maintain the same security and management policies as a private net-
work. They are the most cost-effective method of establishing a point-to-point connec-
tion between remote users and an enterprise customer’s network.
Three main types of VPNs exist, as shown in Figure 2-12:
■Access VPNs provide remote access for a mobile worker and small ofﬁce/home 
ofﬁce (SOHO) to the headquarters’ intranet or extranet over a shared infrastruc-
ture. Access VPNs use analog dialup, ISDN, DSL, mobile IP, and cable technolo-
gies to securely connect mobile users, telecommuters, and branch ofﬁces.

■Intranet VPNs link regional and remote ofﬁces to the headquarters’ internal net-
work over a shared infrastructure using dedicated connections. Intranet VPNs 
differ from extranet VPNs in that they allow access only to the enterprise cus-
tomer’s employees.
■Extranet VPNs link business partners to the headquarters’ network over a shared 
infrastructure using dedicated connections. Extranet VPNs differ from intranet 
VPNs in that they allow access to users outside the enterprise.
Figure 2-12 VPN Technologies
VPNs have the following advantages:
■A single VPN technology can provide privacy for multiple TCP/IP applications. 
Providing privacy for multiple TCP/IP applications is especially important 
in environments in which you want to provide secure access for partners or 
telecommuters.
■Encryption services can be provided for all TCP/IP communications between the 
trusted client and the VPN server. This scenario has the advantage of being trans-
parent to the end user. Because encryption is turned on, the server can enforce it.
■VPN provides mobility to employees and allows employees to access the corpo-

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Digital Bandwidth
LANs and WANs have always had one thing in common: the use of the term band-
width to describe their capabilities. This term is essential to understanding networks, 
but it can be confusing at ﬁrst. The following sections take a detailed look at this con-
cept before delving too far into networking.
The Importance of Bandwidth
Bandwidth is deﬁned as the amount of information that can ﬂow through a network 
connection in a given period of time. This deﬁnition might seem simple, but you must 
understand the concept of bandwidth when studying networking. Why is it so impor-
tant to understand bandwidth?
■Bandwidth is ﬁnite—Regardless of the medium used to build the network, there 
are limits on that network’s capacity to carry information. Bandwidth is limited 
both by the laws of physics and by the technologies employed to place informa-
tion on the medium. For example, a conventional modem’s bandwidth is limited 
to about 56 kilobits per second (kbps) by both the physical properties of twisted-
pair phone wires and by voice modem technology. The technologies employed by 
DSL also use the same twisted-pair phone wires, yet DSL provides much greater 
bandwidth than is available with conventional modems. The frequency range 
(bandwidth) that DSL uses is much wider than the frequency range used for 
voice (and used by the POTS modem). That is why you can send more bits per 
second (bps) over DSL. Optical ﬁber has the physical potential to provide virtu-
ally limitless bandwidth. Even so, the bandwidth of optical ﬁber cannot be fully 
realized until technologies are developed to take full advantage of its potential.
■Bandwidth is not free—It is possible to buy equipment for a LAN that will pro-
vide nearly unlimited bandwidth over a long period of time. For WAN connec-
tions, it is almost always necessary to buy bandwidth from a service provider. In 
either case, an understanding of bandwidth, and changes in demand for band-
width over a given time, can save an individual or business a signiﬁcant amount 
of money. A network manager needs to make the right decisions about the kinds 
of equipment and services to buy.
■Bandwidth is a key factor in analyzing network performance, designing new 
networks, and understanding the Internet—A networking professional must 
understand the tremendous impact of bandwidth and throughput on network 
performance and design. Information ﬂows as a string of bits from computer to 
computer throughout the world. The Internet is trillions upon trillions of bits,

representing massive amounts of information ﬂowing back and forth across the 
globe in seconds or less. In a sense, it might be appropriate to say that the Inter-
net is bandwidth.
■The demand for bandwidth is ever-increasing—As soon as new network technol-
ogies and infrastructures are built to provide greater bandwidth, new applications 
are created to take advantage of the greater capacity. The delivery over the network 
of rich media content, including streaming video and audio, requires tremendous 
amounts of bandwidth. IP telephony systems are now commonly installed in 
place of traditional voice systems, adding further to the need for bandwidth. The 
successful networking professional must anticipate the need for increased band-
width and plan accordingly.
Analogies That Describe Digital Bandwidth
The idea that information ﬂows suggests two analogies that might make it easier to 
visualize bandwidth in a network. Because both water and trafﬁc are said to ﬂow,
consider the following:
■Bandwidth is like the width of a pipe, as shown in Figure 2-13—A network of 
pipes brings fresh water to homes and businesses and carries wastewater away. 
This water network is made up of pipes with different diameters. A city’s main 
water pipe might be 2 meters in diameter, whereas a kitchen faucet might have 
a diameter of only 2 centimeters. The width of the pipe determines the pipe’s 
water-carrying capacity. Thus, the water is analogous to data, and pipe width is 
analogous to bandwidth. Many networking experts say they need to “put in big-
ger pipes” when they want to add more information-carrying capacity.
■Bandwidth is like the number of lanes on a highway, as shown in Figure 2-14—
A network of roads serves every city or town. Large highways with many trafﬁc 
lanes are joined by smaller roads with fewer trafﬁc lanes. These roads lead to 
even smaller, narrower roads, and eventually to the driveways of homes and 
businesses. When very few automobiles use the highway system, each vehicle can 
move freely. When more trafﬁc is added, each vehicle moves more slowly, espe-
cially on roads with fewer lanes for the cars to occupy. Eventually, as even more 
trafﬁc enters the highway system, even multilane highways become congested 
and slow. A data network is much like the highway system, with data packets 
analogous to automobiles, and bandwidth analogous to the number of lanes on 
the highway. When a data network is viewed as a system of highways, it is easy 
to see how low-bandwidth connections can cause trafﬁc to become congested all 
over the network.

Keep in mind that the true, actual meaning of bandwidth, in this context, is the maxi-
mum number of bits that theoretically can pass through a given area of space in a spec-
iﬁed amount of time (under the given conditions). These analogies are only to make it 
easier to understand the concept of bandwidth.
Digital Bandwidth Measurements
In digital systems, the basic unit of bandwidth is bits per second (bps). Bandwidth is 
the measure of how much information, or bits, can ﬂow from one place to another in a 
given amount of time, or seconds. Although bandwidth can be described in bits per 
second, usually some multiple of bits per second is used. In other words, network 
bandwidth is typically described as thousands of bits per second, millions of bits per 
second, and even billions of bits per second.
Although the terms bandwidth and speed are often used interchangeably, they are not 
exactly the same thing. You might say, for example, that a T3 connection at 45 mega-
bits per second (Mbps) operates at a higher speed than a T1 connection at 1.544 Mbps. 
However, if only a small amount of their data-carrying capacity is being used, each of 
these connection types carries data at roughly the same speed, just as a small amount 
of water ﬂows at the same rate through a small pipe as through a large pipe. Therefore, 
it is usually more accurate to say that a T3 connection has greater bandwidth than a 
T1, because it can carry more information in the same period of time, not because it 
has a higher speed.
Table 2-2 summarizes the various units of bandwidth.
Bandwidth Limitations
Bandwidth varies depending on the type of medium as well as the LAN and WAN 
technologies used. The physics of the medium account for some of the difference. Physi-
cal differences in the ways signals travel through twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable,
optical ﬁber, and even air result in fundamental limitations on the information-carrying

capacity of a given medium. However, a network’s actual bandwidth is determined by 
a combination of the physical medium and the technologies chosen for signaling and 
detecting network signals.
For example, current understanding of the physics of unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) 
copper cable puts the theoretical bandwidth limit at more than 1 Gbps. But in actual 
practice, the bandwidth is determined by the use of a particular technology, such as 
10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-TX Ethernet. Bandwidth is also determined 
by other varying factors, such as the number of users in the network, the equipment 
being used, applications, the amount of broadcast, and so on. In other words, the 
actual bandwidth is determined not by the medium’s limitations, but by the signaling 
methods, NICs, and other items of network equipment that are chosen.

tance and bandwidth.

critical part of the network’s speciﬁcation. A typical LAN might be built to provide 
100 Mbps to every desktop workstation, but this does not mean that each user can 
actually move one hundred megabits of data through the network for every second of 
use. This is true only under the most ideal circumstances. The concept of throughput 
can help explain why this is so.
Throughput refers to actual measured bandwidth at a speciﬁc time of day, using spe-
ciﬁc Internet routes, and while a speciﬁc set of data is transmitted on the network. 
Unfortunately, for many reasons, throughput is often far less than the maximum possi-
ble digital bandwidth of the medium that is being used. The following are some of the 
factors that determine throughput:
■Internetworking devices
■Type of data being transferred
■Network topology
■Number of users on the network
■User’s computer
■Server computer
■Power conditions
■Congestion
A network’s theoretical bandwidth is an important consideration in network design, 
because network bandwidth is never greater than the limits imposed by the chosen 
medium and networking technologies. Figure 2-15 lists some of the variables that 
affect throughput. However, it is just as important for a network designer and admin-
istrator to consider the factors that might affect actual throughput. By measuring 
throughput on a regular basis, a network administrator will be aware of changes in 
network performance and changes in the needs of network users. The network can 
then be adjusted accordingly.
Data Transfer Calculation
Network designers and administrators are often called on to make decisions regarding 
bandwidth. Should the size of the WAN connection be increased to accommodate a 
new database? Is the current LAN backbone of sufﬁcient bandwidth for a streaming-
video training program? The answers to questions like these are not always easy to 
ﬁnd, but one place to start is with a simple data transfer calculation.
Using the formula T = S / BW (transfer time = size of ﬁle / bandwidth) lets a network 
administrator estimate several of the important components of network performance. 
If the typical ﬁle size for a given application is known, dividing the ﬁle size by the net-
work bandwidth yields an estimate of the fastest time that the ﬁle can be transferred.

Analogies That Describe Digital Bandwidth

Figure 2-15 Throughput Variables
Two important points should be considered when doing this calculation:
■The result is an estimate only, because the ﬁle size does not include any overhead 
added by the process that takes place to prepare data to be transferred over the 
network. This process is called encapsulation. Encapsulation is covered in more 
detail in later chapters.
■The result is likely to be a best-case transfer time, because available bandwidth 
is almost never at the theoretical maximum for the network type. (A more accu-
rate estimate can be attained if throughput is substituted for bandwidth in the 
equation.)
Although the data transfer calculation is quite simple, it can be tricky if you are not 
careful to use the same units throughout the equation. In other words, if the band-
width is measured in Mbps, the ﬁle size must be in megabits (Mb), not megabytes 
(MB). Because ﬁle sizes are typically given in megabytes, you might need to multiply 
the number of megabytes by 8 to convert to megabits.
Try to answer the following question using the formula T = S / BW. (Be sure to convert 
units of measurement as necessary.)
Would it take less time to send the contents of a ﬂoppy disk full of data (1.44 MB) 
over an ISDN line or to send the contents of a 10-GB hard drive full of data over 
an OC-48 line?

Digital Bandwidth Versus Analog Bandwidth
Until recently, radio, television, and telephone transmissions were sent through the air 
and over wires using electromagnetic waves. These waves are called analog because 
they have the same shapes as the light and sound waves produced by the transmitters. 
As light and sound waves change size and shape, the electrical signal that carries the 
transmission changes proportionately. In other words, the electromagnetic waves are 
analogous to the light and sound waves.
Analog bandwidth is measured by how much of the electromagnetic spectrum is occu-
pied by each signal. The basic unit of analog bandwidth is hertz (Hz), or cycles per sec-
ond. Typically, multiples of this basic unit of analog bandwidth are used, just as with 
digital bandwidth. Units of measurement that are commonly seen are kilohertz (kHz), 
megahertz (MHz), and gigahertz (GHz). These are the units used to describe the band-
width of cordless telephones (which usually operate at either 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz). 
802.11a and 802.11b wireless network frequencies usually operate at 5 GHz and 
2.4 GHz.
Although analog signals can carry a variety of information, they have some signiﬁcant 
disadvantages compared to digital transmissions. The analog video signal that requires 
a wide frequency range for transmission cannot be squeezed into a smaller band. There-
fore, if the necessary analog bandwidth is unavailable, the signal cannot be sent. The 
same goes for digital bandwidth; however, it is less common for digital bandwidth to 
experience this because of its much-larger bandwidth capabilities.
In digital signaling, all information is sent as bits, regardless of the kind of information 
it is. Voice, video, and data all become streams of bits when they are prepared for trans-
mission over digital media, which gives digital bandwidth an important advantage over 
analog bandwidth. Unlimited amounts of information can be sent over the smallest 
(lowest-bandwidth) digital channel. Regardless of how long it takes, when the digital

information arrives at its destination and is reassembled, it can be viewed, listened to, 
read, or processed in its original form.
It is important to understand the differences and similarities between digital and analog 
bandwidth. Both types of bandwidth are regularly encountered in the ﬁeld of informa-
tion technology. However, because this course is concerned primarily with digital net-
working, the term bandwidth refers to digital bandwidth.
Networking Models
Learning about networking is easier when you start with theory and concepts and then 
move on to the more concrete aspects of implementation. As a network professional, 
you need to learn the theory of how networks communicate before you design, build, 
and maintain networks. Learning the concept of layers can help you understand the 
action that occurs during communication from one computer to another.
This section covers the concepts of layering and how it applies speciﬁcally to commu-
nication models. Two speciﬁc models, OSI and TCP/IP, are described, as well as peer-
to-peer layer communication and encapsulation.
Using Layers to Analyze Problems in a Flow of Materials
The concept of layers helps you understand the action that occurs during communica-
tion from one computer to another. The following questions involve the movement of 
physical objects, such as highway trafﬁc or electronic data:
■What is ﬂowing?
■What are the different forms of the object that is ﬂowing?
■What rules govern ﬂow?
■Where does the ﬂow occur?
This motion of objects, whether physical or logical, is called ﬂow. Layers help describe 
the details of the ﬂow process. Examples of systems that ﬂow are the public water sys-
tem, the highway system, the postal system, and the telephone system.
Now examine Table 2-5. What network is being examined? What is ﬂowing? What are 
the different forms of the object that is ﬂowing? What are the rules for ﬂow? Where 
does the ﬂow occur? The networks listed in this chart give analogies to help you under-
stand data ﬂow in computer networks.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
The network communication process is complex. The data, in the form of electronic 
signals, must travel across media to the correct destination computer and then be con-
verted back into its original form to be read by the recipient. Several steps are involved 
in this process. For this reason, the most efﬁcient way to implement network commu-
nications is a layered process. In a layered communication process, each layer per-
forms a speciﬁc task.
In the next few sections, you’ll see how the network communication process is broken 
down using a layered model. You’ll also see how data is sent over the network and 
how it reaches its intended destination. As you learn about the network communica-
tion process, it is important for you to understand the various steps, components, and 
protocols of the network communication process. This understanding provides you 
with valuable troubleshooting information when the communications process does not 
proceed smoothly.
Using Layers to Describe Data Communication
The difﬁculty in dealing with network communications is that it is a very complex pro-
cess. It would be extremely difﬁcult for someone to understand this process if he or she 
looked only at network communication as a whole. The solution to this issue was to 
break down the total network communication system into a series of layers. Each layer

is responsible for a speciﬁc part of network communication. These layers interact with 
the layer above and below them only. This interaction very narrowly deﬁnes a layer’s 
purpose. The two common network models that use layers are the Open System Inter-
connection (OSI) reference model and the TCP/IP reference model.
The OSI Reference Model
The early development of LANs, MANs, and WANs was chaotic in many ways. The 
early 1980s saw tremendous increases in the number and size of networks. As compa-
nies realized the money they could save and the productivity they could gain by using 
networking technology, they added networks and expanded existing networks almost 
as rapidly as new network technologies and products were introduced.
By the mid-1980s, these companies began to experience difﬁculties from all the imple-
mented expansions. It became more difﬁcult for networks that used different speciﬁca-
tions and implementations to communicate with each other. These companies realized 
that they needed to move away from proprietary networking systems. Proprietary sys-
tems are privately developed, owned, and controlled. In the computer industry, propri-
etary is the opposite of open. Proprietary means that one company or a small group of 
companies controls all usage of the technology. Open means that free usage of the 
technology is available to the public.
To address the problem of network incompatibility and the inability to communicate 
with one another, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) researched 
different network schemes, such as DECnet, Systems Network Architecture (SNA), 
and TCP/IP, to ﬁnd a set of rules. As a result of this research, the ISO created a net-
work model that would help vendors create networks that would be compatible and 
operate with other networks.
The process of breaking down complex communications into smaller discrete tasks 
can be compared to the process of building an automobile. When taken as a whole, the 
design, manufacture, and assembly of an automobile is a highly complex process. It 
is unlikely that a single person would know how to perform all the required tasks to 
build a car from scratch. This is why mechanical engineers design the car, manufactur-
ing engineers design the molds to make the parts, and assembly technicians each 
assemble a part of the car.
The OSI reference model, released in 1984, was the descriptive scheme that the ISO 
created. This reference model provided vendors with a set of standards that ensured 
greater compatibility and interoperability among the various types of network technol-
ogies that were produced by many companies around the world.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
The OSI reference model is the primary model used as a guideline for network commu-
nications. Although other models exist, most network vendors today relate their prod-
ucts to the OSI reference model, especially when they want to educate users on the use 
of their products. The OSI reference model is considered the best tool available for 
teaching people about sending and receiving data on a network.
The OSI reference model deﬁnes the network functions that occur at each layer. More 
importantly, it is a framework that facilitates an understanding of how information 
travels throughout a network. In addition, the OSI reference model describes how 
information, or data packets, travels from application programs (such as spreadsheets 
and documents) through a network medium (such as wires) to another application 
program that is located in another computer on a network, even if the sender and 
receiver have different types of network media.
The OSI reference model has seven numbered layers, each of which illustrates a partic-
ular network function:
■Layer 7—Application layer
■Layer 6—Presentation layer
■Layer 5—Session layer
■Layer 4—Transport layer
■Layer 3—Network layer
■Layer 2—Data link layer
■Layer 1—Physical layer
This separation of networking functions is called layering. Dividing the network into 
seven layers provides the following advantages:
■It breaks network communication into smaller, simpler parts.
■It standardizes network components to allow multiple-vendor development and 
support.
■It allows different types of network hardware and software to communicate.
■It prevents changes in one layer from affecting the other layers so that they can 
be developed more quickly.
■It breaks network communication into smaller components to make learning 
easier.
By working through the layers of the OSI reference model, you will understand how 
data packets travel through a network and what devices operate at each layer. As a 
result, you will understand how to troubleshoot network problems if they occur dur-
ing data packet ﬂow.

OSI Layers and Functions
Each OSI layer has a set of functions that it must perform for data packets to travel 
from a source to a destination on a network. The following sections brieﬂy describe 
each layer in the OSI reference model.
Layer 7: The Application Layer
The application layer is the OSI layer that is closest to the user. It provides network 
services to the user’s applications. It differs from the other layers in that it does not 
provide services to any other OSI layer; instead, it provides services only to applica-
tions outside the OSI model. Examples of such applications are spreadsheet programs 
and word-processing programs. The application layer establishes the availability of 
intended communication partners and also synchronizes and establishes agreement on 
procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. Examples of the Layer 7 
applications include Telnet and HTTP.
Layer 6: The Presentation Layer
The presentation layer ensures that the information that the application layer of one 
system sends out can be read by the application layer of another system. If necessary, 
the presentation layer translates among multiple data formats by using a common for-
mat. One of the more important tasks of this layer is encryption and decryption. The 
common Layer 6 graphic standards are PICT, TIFF, and JPEG. Examples of Layer 6 
standards that guide the presentation of sound and movies are MIDI and MPEG.
Layer 5: The Session Layer
As its name implies, the session layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions 
between two communicating hosts. The session layer provides its services to the pre-
sentation layer. It also synchronizes dialogue between the two hosts’ presentation lay-
ers and manages their data exchange. In addition to handling session regulation, the 
session layer offers provisions for efﬁcient data transfer, class of service, and exception 
reporting of session layer, presentation layer, and application layer problems. Exam-
ples of Layer 5 protocols are the Network File System (NFS), X-Window System, and 
AppleTalk Session Protocol (ASP).
Layer 4: The Transport Layer
The transport layer segments data from the sending host’s system and reassembles it 
into a data stream on the receiving host’s system. The boundary between the transport 
layer and the session layer can be thought of as the boundary between application pro-
tocols and data-ﬂow protocols. Whereas the application, presentation, and session

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
layers are concerned with application issues, the lowest four layers are concerned with 
data-transport issues.
The transport layer attempts to provide a data-transport service that shields the upper 
layers from transport-implementation details. Speciﬁcally, issues such as reliability of 
transport between two hosts are the concern of the transport layer. In providing com-
munication service, the transport layer establishes, maintains, and properly terminates 
virtual circuits. Transport error detection and recovery and information ﬂow control 
are used to provide reliable service. Examples of Layer 4 protocols are Transmission 
Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Sequenced Packet 
Exchange (SPX).
Layer 3: The Network Layer
The network layer is a complex layer that provides connectivity and path selection 
between two host systems that might be located on geographically separated networks. 
Additionally, the network layer is concerned with logical addressing. Examples of 
Layer 3 protocols are Internet Protocol (IP), Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), 
and AppleTalk.
Layer 2: The Data Link Layer
The data link layer provides reliable transit of data across a physical link. In so doing, 
the data link layer is concerned with physical (as opposed to logical) addressing, net-
work topology, network access, error notiﬁcation, ordered delivery of frames, and 
ﬂow control.
Layer 1: The Physical Layer
The physical layer deﬁnes the electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional speci-
ﬁcations for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between end 
systems. Such characteristics as voltage levels, timing of voltage changes, physical data 
rates, maximum transmission distances, physical connectors, and other similar 
attributes are deﬁned by physical layer speciﬁcations.
Peer-to-Peer Communications
For data packets to travel from the source to the destination, each layer of the OSI 
model at the source must communicate with its peer layer at the destination. This form 
of communication is called peer-to-peer communication. During this process, the pro-
tocols at each layer exchange information, called protocol data units (PDUs), between
peer layers. Each layer of communication on the source computer communicates with 
a layer-speciﬁc PDU and with its peer layer on the destination computer, as shown in 
Figure 2-17.

Networking Models
73
Figure 2-17 Peer-to-Peer Communication
Data packets on a network originate at a source and then travel to a destination. Each 
layer depends on the service function of the OSI layer below it. To provide this service, 
the lower layer uses encapsulation to put the PDU from the upper layer into its data 
ﬁeld. Each layer then adds whatever headers it needs to perform its function. As the data 
moves through the layers of the OSI model, additional headers are added. The group-
ing of data at the Layer 4 PDU is called a segment.
The network layer provides a service to the transport layer. The network layer moves 
the data through the internetwork by encapsulating the data and attaching a header to 
create a packet (the Layer 3 PDU). The header contains information required to com-
plete the transfer, such as source and destination logical addresses.
The data link layer provides a service to the network layer. It encapsulates the network 
layer information in a frame (the Layer 2 PDU). The frame header contains the physical 
addresses required to complete the data link functions, and the frame trailer contains 
the frame check sequence (FCS), which is used by the receiver to detect whether the 
data is in error. This then becomes the data that is passed down to the physical layer.
The physical layer provides a service to the data link layer. The physical layer encodes 
the data link frame into a pattern of 1s and 0s (bits) for transmission on the medium 
(usually a wire) at Layer 1.
Network devices such as hubs, switches, and routers work at the lowest three layers. 
Hubs operate at Layer 1, switches operate at Layer 2, and routers at Layer 3. The ﬁrst 
layer that deals with the end-to-end transport between end users is the transport layer 
(Layer 4).

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
DoD (TCP/IP) Model
Although the OSI reference model is universally recognized, the historical and techni-
cal open standard of the Internet is Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
(TCP/IP). The TCP/IP reference model and the TCP/IP protocol suite make data com-
munication possible between any two computers anywhere in the world at nearly the 
speed of light. The TCP/IP model has historical importance, just like the standards that 
allowed the telephone, electrical power, railroad, television, and videotape industries 
to ﬂourish.
The U.S. DoD provided funding for the invention of the TCP/IP reference model because 
it wanted a network that could survive any conditions, even a nuclear war. To illus-
trate further, imagine a world at war, criss-crossed by different kinds of connections, 
including wires, microwaves, optical ﬁbers, and satellite links. Then imagine that 
information/data (in the form of packets) must ﬂow, regardless of the condition of any 
particular node or network on the internetwork (which, in this case, might have been 
destroyed by the war). The DoD wants its packets to get through every time, under 
any conditions, from any one point to any other point. This very difﬁcult design problem 
brought about the creation of the TCP/IP model, which has since become the standard 
on which the Internet has grown.
When reading about the TCP/IP model layers, remember the original intent of the 
Internet; it helps explain why certain things are as they are. The TCP/IP model, as 
shown in Figure 2-18, has four layers:
■The application layer
■The transport layer
■The Internet layer
■The network access layer

It is important to note that some of the layers in the TCP/IP model have the same 
names as layers in the OSI model. However, do not confuse the layers of the two models. 
Even with the same name, most the layers have the same functions in each model, but 
some do not.
Detailed Encapsulation Process
All communications on a network originate at a source and are sent to a destination. 
The information that is sent on a network is called data or data packets. If one com-
puter (Host A) wants to send data to another computer (Host B), the data must ﬁrst be 
packaged by a process called encapsulation.
Encapsulation
Encapsulation wraps data with the necessary protocol information before network 
transit. Therefore, as the data moves down through the layers of the OSI model, each 
OSI layer adds a header (and also a trailer at Layer 2) to the data before passing it 
down to a lower layer. The headers and trailers contain control information for the 
network devices and receiver, to ensure proper delivery of the data and to ensure that 
the receiver can properly interpret the data. For example, think of a header as an 
address on an envelope. An address is required on the envelope so that the letter inside 
the envelope can be delivered to the desired recipient.
To see how encapsulation occurs, examine the manner in which data travels through 
the layers, as illustrated in Figure 2-19. After the data is sent from the source, it travels 
through the application layer down through the other layers. The packaging and ﬂow 
of the data that is exchanged go through changes as the layers perform their services 
for end users.
The data, in the form of electronic signals, must travel across a cable to the correct 
destination computer and then be converted to its original form to be read by the 
recipient. As you can imagine, several steps are involved in this process. For this rea-
son, developers of hardware, software, and protocols recognized that the most efﬁcient 
way to implement network communications would be as a layered process.
Lab Activity
OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
In this exercise, you describe and compare the layers of the OSI and TCP/IP 
models. You also name the TCP/IP protocols and utilities that operate at each 
layer.
NOTE
The word header
means that informa-
tion was added to the 
front of the packet, 
just as trailers are 
added to the end. In 
addition, an address is 
an important piece of 
information that gets 
added.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Figure 2-19 Encapsulation
As illustrated in Figure 2-20, networks must perform the following ﬁve conversion 
steps to encapsulate data:
Step 1
Build the data—As a user sends an e-mail message, its alphanumeric 
characters are converted to data that can travel across the internetwork.
Step 2
Package the data for end-to-end transport—The data is packaged for 
internetwork transport. By using segments, the transport function 
ensures that the message hosts at both ends of the e-mail system can 
communicate reliably.
Step 3
Append (add) the network address to the header—The data is put into a 
packet or datagram that contains a network header with source and des-
tination logical addresses. These addresses help network devices send the 
packets across the network along a chosen path.
Step 4
Append (add) the local address to the data link header—Each network 
device must put the packet into a frame. The frame allows connection 
to the next directly-connected network device on the link. Each device in 
the chosen network path requires framing to be connected to the next 
device.
Step 5
Convert to bits for transmission—A clocking function lets the devices 
distinguish these bits as they travel across the medium. The medium on 
the physical internetwork can vary along the path used. For example, the 
e-mail message can originate on a LAN, cross a campus backbone, and 
go out a WAN link until it reaches its destination on another remote 
LAN. Headers and trailers are added as data moves down through the 
layers of the OSI model.

77
Figure 2-20 Data Encapsulation Process
De-Encapsulation
When the remote device receives a sequence of bits, the physical layer at the remote 
device passes the bits to the data link layer for manipulation. The data link layer does 
the following:
Step 1
Veriﬁes that the MAC destination address matches this station’s address 
or is an Ethernet broadcast. If neither of these situations is true, the 
frame is discarded.
Step 2
If the data is in error, it can be discarded, and the data link layer might 
ask for the data to be retransmitted. If the data is not in error, the data 
link layer reads and interprets the control information in the data link 
header.
Step 3
The data link layer strips the data link header and trailer and then passes 
the remaining data up to the network layer based on the control informa-
tion in the data link header.
This process is called de-encapsulation. Each subsequent layer performs a similar de-
encapsulation process. Think of the de-encapsulation process as the process of reading 
the address on a letter to see if it is for you and then removing the letter from the enve-
lope if the letter is addressed to you.
More Information: Cyclical Redundancy Check 
Each data packet has information added to the raw data itself, in the form of packet headers. 
The headers contain addressing information so that the packets reach the correct destination. 
They also contain sequencing information so the data can be reassembled accurately when all 
packets reach the receiving computer.

Networking Devices
Equipment that connects directly to a network segment is called a device. These 
devices are broken into two classiﬁcations:
■End user devices—Include computers, printers, scanners, and other devices that 
provide services directly to the user.
■Network devices—Include all devices that connect the end-user devices to allow 
them to communicate.
End-user devices that provide users with a connection to the network are also called 
hosts. Figure 2-21 shows an example of an end-user device—a workstation.
Figure 2-21 End-User Device: Workstation
Header information is placed at the head of the packet, in front of the original data. Packets also 
can include trailer information, which is appended to the back of the packet, following the orig-
inal data.
The error-checking component in the trailer is called a cyclical redundancy check (CRC). The 
CRC performs calculations on the packet before it leaves the source computer and again when 
it reaches the destination. If the results of these calculations are different, the data has changed. 
This can occur because of a disruption of the electrical signals that represent the 0s and 1s 
making up the data. If a discrepancy is found, that packet can be resent.

These devices allow users to share, create, and obtain information. Host devices can 
exist without a network, but without a network, host capabilities are greatly reduced. 
Host devices are physically connected to the network media using a network interface 
card (NIC). They use this connection to perform the tasks of sending e-mails, printing 
reports, scanning pictures, or accessing databases. A NIC is a printed circuit board 
that ﬁts into the expansion slot of a bus on a computer motherboard, or it can be a 
peripheral device. It is also called a network adapter. Laptop or notebook computer 
NICs are usually the size of a PCMCIA card.
Each NIC carries a unique code called a MAC address. MAC addresses are covered 
more in a moment. As the name implies, the NIC controls host access to the medium.
There are no standardized symbols for end-user devices in the networking industry. 
They bear a resemblance to the real device to allow for quick recognition.
Network devices provide transport for the data that needs to be transferred between 
end-user devices. Network devices extend cable connections, concentrate connections, 
convert data formats, and manage data transfers. Examples of devices that perform 
these functions are repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, and routers. The following sec-
tions provide an overview of some common networking devices.
Repeaters
Repeaters are networking devices that exist at Layer 1, the physical layer, of the OSI 
reference model. To understand how a repeater works, it is important to understand 
that as data leaves a source and goes out over the network, it is transformed into either 
electrical or light pulses that pass along the networking medium. These pulses are 
called signals. When signals leave a transmitting station, they are clean and easily rec-
ognizable. However, the longer the cable length, the weaker and more deteriorated the 
signals become as they pass along the networking medium. The purpose of a repeater 
is to regenerate and retime network signals at the bit level, allowing them to travel a 
longer distance on the medium.
The term repeater originally meant a single port “in” device and a single port “out” 
device. Today multiple-port repeaters also exist. Repeaters are classiﬁed as Layer 1 
devices in the OSI model because they act only on the bit level and look at no other 
information.
Hubs
The purpose of a hub is to regenerate and retime network signals. The characteristics 
of a hub are similar to those of a repeater. A hub is a common connection point for 
1102.book  Page 79  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

80
Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
devices in a network, as shown in Figure 2-22. Hubs commonly connect segments of a 
LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to 
the other ports so that all the LAN’s segments can see all the packets.
Figure 2-22 Hub
Because hubs and repeaters have similar characteristics, a hub is also called a multiport
repeater. The difference between a repeater and a hub is the number of cables that con-
nect to the device. Whereas a repeater typically has only two ports, a hub generally has 
from four to 20 or more ports, as shown in Figure 2-23. Whereas a repeater receives 
on one port and repeats on the other, a hub receives on one port and transmits on all 
the other ports.
Figure 2-23 Hubs Have Several Ports
The following are the most important properties of hubs:
■Hubs amplify signals.
■Hubs propagate signals through the network.
■Hubs do not require ﬁltering.
1102.book  Page 80  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Networking Models
81
■Hubs do not require path determination or switching.
■Hubs are used as network-concentration points.
Hubs are commonly used in Ethernet 10BASE-T or 100BASE-T networks. (You will 
learn more about Ethernet networks in Chapter 6, “Ethernet Technologies and Ether-
net Switching.”) Hubs create a central connection point for the wiring medium. They 
also increase the network’s reliability by allowing any single cable to fail without dis-
rupting the entire network. This feature differs from the bus topology, in which the 
failure of one cable disrupts the entire network. (Network topology is discussed later 
in this chapter.) Hubs are considered Layer 1 devices because they only regenerate the 
signal and repeat it out all their ports (network connections).
In Ethernet networks, all the hosts are connected to the same physical medium. Signals 
that are sent out across the common medium are received by all devices. A collision is
a situation that can occur when 2 bits propagate at the same time on the same network. 
The area within the network from where the data packets originate and collide is called 
a collision domain. All shared-media environments are collision domains, or band-
width domains. You learn more about collision domains in Chapter 5, “Ethernet Fun-
damentals.”
As previously mentioned in this section, the function of Layer 1 devices is simply to 
facilitate the transmission of signals. The devices recognize no information patterns in 
the signals, no addresses, and no data. When two wires are connected using hubs or 
repeaters, all the interconnections are part of a collision domain.
Network Interface Cards
Network interface cards (NICs) are considered Layer 2 devices because each NIC 
throughout the world carries a unique code, called a Media Access Control (MAC)
address. This address controls data communication for the host on the LAN. The NIC 
controls the access of the host to the medium. Figure 2-24 shows a NIC.
Figure 2-24 Network Interface Card

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Bridges
A bridge is a Layer 2 device designed to create two or more LAN segments, each of 
which is a separate collision domain. In other words, bridges were designed to create 
more usable bandwidth. The purpose of a bridge is to ﬁlter trafﬁc on a LAN to keep 
local trafﬁc local yet allow connectivity to other parts (segments) of the LAN for trafﬁc 
that is directed there. Every networking device has a unique MAC address on the NIC. 
The bridge keeps track of which MAC addresses are on each side of the bridge and 
makes forwarding decisions based on this MAC address list.
Bridges ﬁlter network trafﬁc by looking only at the MAC address. Therefore, they can 
rapidly forward trafﬁc representing any network layer protocol. Because bridges look 
only at MAC addresses, they are not concerned with network layer protocols. Conse-
quently, bridges are concerned only with passing or not passing frames, based on their 
destination MAC addresses. The following are the important properties of bridges:
■Bridges are more “intelligent” than hubs. That is, they can analyze incoming 
frames and forward (or drop) them based on addressing information.
■Bridges collect and pass packets between two or more LAN segments.
■Bridges create more collision domains, allowing more than one device to trans-
mit simultaneously without causing a collision.
■Bridges maintain MAC address tables.
Figure 2-25 shows how a bridge is used. The appearances of bridges vary greatly, 
depending on the type.

What deﬁnes a bridge is its Layer 2 ﬁltering of frames and how this is accomplished. 
To ﬁlter or selectively deliver network trafﬁc, bridges build tables of all MAC 
addresses located on a network segment and other networks and then map them to 
associated ports. The process is as follows:
Step 1
If data comes along the network medium, a bridge compares the destina-
tion MAC address carried by the data to MAC addresses contained in its 
tables.
Step 2
If the bridge determines that the data’s destination MAC address is from 
the same network segment as the source, it does not forward the data to 
other segments of the network. This process is known as ﬁltering. By per-
forming this process, bridges can signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of traf-
ﬁc between network segments by eliminating unnecessary trafﬁc.
Step 3
If the bridge determines that the data’s destination MAC address is not 
from the same network segment as the source, it forwards the data to the 
appropriate segment.
Step 4
If the destination MAC address is unknown to the bridge, the bridge 
broadcasts the data to all devices on a network except the one on which 
it was received. This process is known as ﬂooding.
A broadcast is a data packet that is sent to all nodes on a network. A broadcast domain
consists of all the devices connected to a network that receive the data packet broad-
cast by a node to all other nodes on the same network. Because every device on the 
network must pay attention to broadcasts, bridges always forward them. Therefore, 
all segments in a bridged environment are considered to be in the same broadcast 
domain.
As was the case in the repeater/hub combination, another device, called a switch, is 
used for multiple bridge connections. The next section discusses switches in greater 
detail.
Layer 2 Switches
Layer 2 switches, also called LAN switches or workgroup switches, often replace 
shared hubs and work with existing cable infrastructures to ensure that the switches 
are installed with minimal disruption of existing networks. Figure 2-26 shows a switch.
Figure 2-26 Switch
1102.book  Page 83  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

84
Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Like bridges, switches connect LAN segments, use a table of MAC addresses to deter-
mine the segment on which a frame needs to be transmitted, and reduce trafﬁc. Switches 
operate at much higher speeds than bridges.
Switches are data link layer devices that, like bridges, let multiple physical LAN seg-
ments be interconnected into single larger networks. Similar to bridges, switches for-
ward and ﬂood trafﬁc based on MAC addresses. Because switching is performed in 
hardware, it is signiﬁcantly faster than the switching function performed by a bridge 
using software. Think of each switch port as a microbridge. Each switch port acts as a 
separate bridge and gives each host the medium’s full bandwidth. This process is called 
microsegmentation.
Microsegmentation allows the creation of private or dedicated segments—one host per 
segment. Each host receives instant access to the full bandwidth and does not have to 
compete for available bandwidth with other hosts. In full-duplex switches, because 
only one device is connected to each switch port, collisions do not occur.
However, as with a bridge, a switch forwards a broadcast message to all the segments 
on the switch. All segments in a switched environment are therefore considered to be 
in the same broadcast domain.
Some switches—mainly high-end and enterprise-level switches—perform multilayer 
functioning. For example, the Cisco 6500 and 8500 series perform some Layer 3 func-
tions. The Cisco Catalyst 8500, shown in Figure 2-27, is a Layer 3-enhanced ATM 
switch that seamlessly integrates wire-speed Layer 3 switching and ATM switching. The 
Catalyst 8500 family delivers campus and MAN solutions with scalable performance, 
lower cost of ownership, and intranet-based application features to deliver increased 
business productivity. Unlike old ﬁrst- or second-generation ATM switches, which force 
customers to have a costly, inefﬁcient, multisystem solution, the Catalyst 8500 switch 
provides an integrated ATM and Gigabit Ethernet solution in a single chassis.
Routers
A router, as shown in Figure 2-28, is a type of internetworking device that passes data 
packets between networks based on Layer 3 addresses. A router can make decisions 
regarding the best path for delivery of data on the network.
Working at Layer 3 allows the router to make decisions based on network addresses 
instead of individual Layer 2 MAC addresses. Routers also can connect different Layer 2 
technologies, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). 
Routers also commonly connect Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and serial con-
nections. However, because of their capability to route packets based on Layer 3 infor-
mation, routers have become the backbone of the Internet and run the IP protocol.

Figure 2-28 Router
The purpose of a router is to examine incoming packets (Layer 3 data), choose the best 
path for them through the network, and then switch them to the proper outgoing port. 
Routers are the most important trafﬁc-regulating devices on large networks. Routers 
let virtually any type of computer communicate with any other computer anywhere in 
the world.

Voice, DSL, Cable Modem, and Optical Devices
Recent networking demands of voice and data network integration and fast data 
transmission for end users and network backbones have resulted in the development 
of the following new networking devices:
■Voice gateways for handling converged packetized voice and data trafﬁc
■DSLAMs used at the service provider’s central ofﬁce for concentrating DSL 
modem connections from hundreds of homes
■Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) used at a cable operator’s headend or 
central location to concentrate connections from many cable modem subscribers.
■Optical platforms for sending and receiving data over ﬁber-optic cable, providing 
high-speed connection
Voice Gateway
A gateway is a special-purpose device that converts information from one protocol 
stack to another. The Cisco AS5400 Series Universal Access Server provides cost-
effective platforms that combine routing, remote access, voice gateway, ﬁrewall, and 
digital modem functionality. Figure 2-29 shows a Cisco AS5400 Series Universal Gate-
way, which offers universal port data, voice, wireless, and fax services on any port at 
any time.

DSLAM
A digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) is a device used in a variety of 
DSL technologies. A DSLAM serves as the interface point between a number of sub-
scriber premises and the carrier network. Figure 2-30 shows a Cisco 6100 Series 
Advanced DSL Access Multiplexer.

Cable operators use a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) at various concen-
tration points or hubs in the cable network to provide high-speed Internet access, voice, 
and other networking services to home and business subscribers. The Cisco uBR7100 
(Universal Broadband Router) CMTS series is designed for MTUs (multitenant units)

Security Devices
Because of increased Internet and extranet connections, as well as more telecommuters 
and mobile users accessing enterprise networks from remote sites, the importance of 
network security increases. Firewalls, AAA servers, and VPN concentrators are com-
ponents or devices related to network security.
Firewalls
The term ﬁrewall refers to either a ﬁrewall program running on a router or server or a 
special standalone hardware component of a network. A ﬁrewall protects a private 
network’s resources from users in other networks.
Working closely with a router program, a ﬁrewall examines each network packet to 
determine whether to forward it to its destination. Using a ﬁrewall is like using a trafﬁc 
ofﬁcer to ensure that only valid trafﬁc can enter or leave certain networks. Figure 2-33 
shows a Cisco PIX Firewall 535 series, which is a dedicated network device.

AAA Servers
An AAA server is a server program that handles user requests for access to computer 
and network resources. An AAA server provides authentication, authorization, and 
accounting services for an enterprise. The AAA server ensures that only authentic users 
can get into the network (authentication), that the users are allowed access only to the 
resources they need (authorization), and that records are kept of everything they do 
after they are allowed entry (accounting).
An AAA server is like the credit card system. To put charges on a credit card, the mer-
chant must verify that the credit card actually belongs to the person using it (authenti-
cation). The merchant must also check that the credit card has enough credit left for 
the requested charge amount (authorization), and then the merchant must record the 
charge to the user’s account (accounting). Figure 2-34 shows an example of where an 
AAA server is used.

Wireless Devices
A wireless LAN (WLAN) provides all the features and beneﬁts of traditional LAN 
technologies, such as Ethernet, without the limitations of wire or cables. Some com-
mon wireless networking devices include wireless NICs, wireless access points, and 
wireless bridges. The following sections brieﬂy describe these wireless networking 
devices.
Wireless NICs
Each wireless client requires a wireless NIC or client adapter. These are available as 
PCMCIA and PCI cards to provide wireless connectivity for both laptop and desktop 
workstations. Laptops or notebook PCs, with wireless NICs, can move freely through-
out a campus environment while maintaining connectivity to the network. Wireless 
PCI and ISA adapters (for desktop workstations) allow end stations to be added to the 
LAN quickly, easily, and inexpensively without the need for additional cabling. All 
adapters feature antennas—the PCMCIA card with a built-in antenna and the PCI 
card with an external antenna. The antennas provide the range required for data trans-
mission and reception. Figure 2-36 shows wireless adapters.

Wireless Access Points
The access point (AP) or base station (see Figure 2-37) is a wireless LAN transceiver 
that can act as a hub—the center point of a standalone wireless network—or as a 
bridge—the connection point between wireless and wired networks. Multiple APs can 
provide roaming functionality, allowing wireless users freedom to roam throughout a 
facility while maintaining uninterrupted connectivity to the network.

Wireless Bridges
A wireless bridge, shown in Figure 2-38, provides high-speed (11 Mbps), long-range 
(up to 25 miles), line-of-sight wireless connectivity between Ethernet networks. Any 
Cisco AP can be used as a repeater (extension point) for the wireless network.

Network Topologies
A network topology deﬁnes how computers, printers, network devices, and other 
devices are connected. In other words, a network topology describes the layout of the 
wire and devices as well as the paths used by data transmissions. The topology greatly 
inﬂuences how the network works.
Networks can have both a physical and a logical topology. Physical topology refers to 
the physical layout of the devices and media. Physical topologies that are commonly 
used are
■Bus
■Ring
■Star
■Extended star

Network Topologies
95
The following sections describe the different networking topologies in more detail.
Bus Topology
Commonly called a linear bus, a bus topology connects all the devices using a single 
cable (see Figure 2-41). This cable proceeds from one computer to the next like a bus 
line going through a city.
Figure 2-41 Bus Topology
With a physical bus topology, the main cable segment must end with a terminator that 
absorbs the signal when it reaches the end of the line or wire. If there is no terminator, 
the electrical signal representing the data bounces back at the end of the wire, causing 
errors in the network.
Star and Extended-Star Topologies
The star topology, shown in Figure 2-42, is the most commonly used physical topology 
in Ethernet LANs. When installed, the star topology resembles spokes in a bicycle wheel. 
The star topology is made up of a central connection point that is a device such as a 
hub, switch, or router, where all the cabling segments meet. Each host in the network 
is connected to the central device with its own cable.
Although a physical star topology costs more to implement than the physical bus 
topology, the advantages of a star topology make it worth the additional cost. Because 
each host is connected to the central device with its own cable, when that cable has a 
problem, only that host is affected; the rest of the network remains operational. This 
beneﬁt is extremely important and is why virtually every newly designed Ethernet 
LAN has a physical star topology.
A central connection point might be desirable for security or restricted access, but this 
is also a main disadvantage of a star topology. If the central device fails, the whole net-
work becomes disconnected.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Figure 2-42 Star Topology
When a star network is expanded to include an additional networking device that is 
connected to the main networking device, it is called an extended-star topology, as 
shown in Figure 2-43.
Figure 2-43 Extended-Star Topology
1102.book  Page 96  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Network Topologies
97
Ring Topology
The logical ring topology is another important topology in LAN connectivity. As the 
name implies, hosts are connected in the form of a ring or circle. Unlike the physical 
bus topology, the ring topology has no beginning or end that needs to be terminated. 
Data is transmitted in a way unlike the logical bus topology. A frame travels around 
the ring, stopping at each node. If a node wants to transmit data, it is permitted to add 
that data as well as the destination address to the frame. The frame then continues 
around the ring until it ﬁnds the destination node, which takes the data out of the 
frame. The advantage of using this type of method is that there are no collisions of 
data packets.
Two types of rings exist:
■Single ring
■Dual ring
In a single ring, as shown in Figure 2-44, all the devices on the network share a single 
cable, and the data travels in one direction only. Each device waits its turn to send data 
over the network. Most single-ring topologies are actually wired as a star.
Figure 2-44 Ring Topology
In a dual ring, two rings allow data to be sent in both directions, as shown in Figure 2-45. 
This setup creates redundancy (fault tolerance), meaning that if one ring fails, data can 
be transmitted on the other ring. Also, if both rings fail, a “wrap” at the fault can heal 
the topology back into a ring.
1102.book  Page 97  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

98
Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Figure 2-45 Dual-Ring Topology
Hierarchical Topology
A hierarchical topology is created similar to an extended-star topology. The primary 
difference is that it does not use a central node. Instead, it uses a trunk node from 
which it branches to other nodes, as shown in Figure 2-46. Two types of tree topolo-
gies exist: the binary tree (each node splits into two links) and the backbone tree 
(a backbone trunk has branch nodes with links hanging from it).
Full-Mesh and Partial-Mesh Topologies
The full-mesh topology connects all devices (nodes) to each other for redundancy and 
fault tolerance, as shown in Figure 2-47. The wiring in a full-mesh topology has very 
distinct advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that every node is connected 
physically to every other node, which creates a redundant connection. If any link fails, 
information can ﬂow through many other links to reach its destination. The primary 
disadvantage is that for anything more than a small number of nodes, the amount 
of media for the links and the number of the connections on the lines becomes over-
whelming. Implementing a full-mesh topology is expensive and difﬁcult. The full-mesh 
topology is usually implemented in WANs between routers.

99
Figure 2-46 Hierarchical Topology
Figure 2-47 Full-Mesh Topology
In a partial-mesh topology, at least one device maintains multiple connections to oth-
ers without being fully meshed, as shown in Figure 2-48. A partial-mesh topology still 
provides redundancy by having several alternative routes. If one route cannot be used, 
the data takes another route, even if it is longer. The partial-mesh topology is used for 
many telecommunications backbones, as well as the Internet.
Logical Topology
A network’s logical topology is how the hosts communicate across the medium. The 
two most common types of logical topology are broadcast and token passing.
1102.book  Page 99  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

100
Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
Figure 2-48 Partial-Mesh Topology
Broadcast topology simply means that each host addresses its data to a particular NIC, 
to a multicast address, or to a broadcast address on the network medium. There is no 
order that the stations must follow to use the network. It is ﬁrst come, ﬁrst serve. 
Ethernet also works this way, as explained later in this course.
The second logical topology is token passing. Token passing controls network access 
by passing an electronic token sequentially to each host. When a host receives the 
token, it can send data on the network. If the host has no data to send, it passes the 
token to the next host, and the process repeats itself. Two examples of networks that 
use token passing are Token Ring and FDDI, both of which are examples of token 
passing on a physical ring topology.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■Historic reasons for the development of LANs and WANs
■A LAN consists of computers, NICs, peripheral devices, networking media, and 
network devices.
■A WAN consists of two or more LANs spanning two or more geographically sep-
arate areas.
■A MAN spans a metropolitan area, such as a city or a suburban area.
1102.book  Page 100  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Summary
101
■A SAN provides enhanced system performance, is scalable, and has disaster 
tolerance built in.
■A data center is a globally coordinated network of devices designed to accelerate 
the delivery of information over the Internet infrastructure.
■Intranets are designed to be accessed by users who have access privileges to an 
organization’s internal network. Extranets are designed to deliver applications 
and services that are intranet-based but that employ extended, secured access 
to external users or enterprises.
■A VPN is a private network that is constructed within a public network infra-
structure. Three main types of VPNs are access, intranet, and extranet.
■Bandwidth and throughput are measures of a network’s speed or capacity.
■Breaking a complex problem into smaller units helps you understand the larger 
problem.
■Communication is a complex problem that can be broken into a series of layers. 
Multiple systems can be used for the breakdown.
■The ISO created and released the OSI model in 1984 to provide vendors with a 
set of standards to ensure greater compatibility and interoperability among vari-
ous types of network technologies.
■The OSI reference model is a descriptive network scheme whose standards ensure 
greater compatibility and interoperability between various types of network 
technologies.
■Each OSI layer has a speciﬁc function and protocols to support it. The seven layers 
of the OSI model are application, presentation, session, transport, network, data 
link, and physical.
■Each layer in a sending device’s communication protocol communicates with its 
peer layer in the receiving device.
■The TCP/IP model has four layers: application, transport, Internet, and network 
access.
■All communications on a network originate at a source and are sent to a destina-
tion. That encapsulation wraps data with the necessary protocol information 
before network transit.
■Networking devices are products that connect networks. Hubs, switches, and 
routers interconnect devices within LANs, MANs, and WANs. Networking 
devices function at different layers of the OSI model.
■Repeaters regenerate, amplify, and retime signals before sending them along the 
network.

Chapter 2: Networking Fundamentals
■The term hub is used instead of repeater when referring to the device that serves 
as the center of a network. Hubs (also known as multiport repeaters) work at 
Layer 1 only and make no decisions. A hubs-only environment is a shared-access 
environment within which collisions occur. As devices are added to the network, 
more collisions occur, and performance declines dramatically.
■LAN switches work at Layer 2 and make limited MAC hardware address deci-
sions. Ethernet switches provide dedicated LAN connections.
■Working at Layers 2, 3, and 4, multilayer switches enable the implementation of 
Layer 3 quality of service and security functionality. Multilayer switches perform 
many of the same functions as routers do, but they do so in hardware.
■Routers can make decisions regarding the best path for delivery of data on the 
network.
■Various types of servers provide services to computers and users accessing the 
network. Firewalls, AAA servers, and VPN concentrators provide security to the 
network.
■Various types of wireless networking devices provide services to computers and 
users accessing the network. Common wireless networking devices include wire-
less adapters, wireless access points, and wireless bridges.
■A physical topology describes the plan for wiring the physical devices. A logical 
topology describes how information ﬂows through a network.
■In a physical bus topology, a single cable connects all the devices.
■The most commonly used architecture in Ethernet LANs is the physical star 
topology. In a star topology, each host in the network is connected to the central 
device with its own cable. When a star network is expanded to include additional 
networking devices that are connected to the main networking device, it is called 
an extended-star topology.
■In a ring topology, all the hosts are connected in the form of a ring or circle.
■A full-mesh topology connects all devices to each other.

ﬁrewall
A router or access server designated as a buffer between any connected public 
networks and a private network.
ﬂooding
A trafﬁc-passing technique used by switches and bridges in which trafﬁc 
received on an interface is sent out all that device’s interfaces except the interface on 
which the information was received originally.
frame
A logical grouping of information sent as a data link layer unit over a trans-
mission medium.
full-mesh topology
Connects all devices (nodes) to each other for redundancy and 
fault tolerance.
hierarchical topology
Created similar to an extended-star topology. The primary dif-
ference is that it does not use a central node. Instead, it uses a trunk node from which 
it branches to other nodes.
hub
A common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs commonly connect 
segments of a LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives at one port, 
it is copied to the other ports so that all the segments of the LAN can see all the packets.

tively small geographic area (up to a few thousand meters). LANs connect worksta-
tions, peripherals, terminals, and other devices in a single building or another 
geographically limited area.
Media Access Control (MAC)
A hardware address that uniquely identiﬁes each node 
of a network. This address controls data communication for the host on the network.
metropolitan-area network (MAN)
A network that spans a metropolitan area. Gen-
erally, a MAN spans a larger geographic area than a LAN but a smaller geographic 
area than a WAN.
microsegmentation

per segment. Each host receives instant access to the full bandwidth and does not have 
to compete for available bandwidth with other hosts.
network interface card (NIC)
A printed circuit board that ﬁts into the expansion slot 
of a bus on a computer motherboard. Also can be a peripheral device.

Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model
A network architectural model 
developed by the ISO. This model consists of seven layers, each of which speciﬁes par-
ticular network functions, such as addressing, ﬂow control, error control, encapsulation, 
and reliable message transfer. The OSI reference model is used universally as a method 
for teaching and understanding network functionality.
packet
A logical grouping of information that includes a header containing control 
information and (usually) user data. Packets most often refer to network-layer units of 
data.
partial-mesh topology
At least one device maintains multiple connections to others 
without being fully meshed. A partial-mesh topology still provides redundancy by hav-
ing several alternative routes.
peer-to-peer communication
A form of communication in which each layer of the 
OSI model at the source must communicate with its peer layer at the destination.
physical layer
Layer 1 of the OSI reference model. The physical layer deﬁnes the 
electrical, mechanical, procedural, and functional speciﬁcations for activating, main-
taining, and deactivating the physical link between end systems.

mation sent by the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer 
of another.
protocol
A formal description of a set of rules and conventions that govern how 
devices on a network exchange information.
protocol suite
A set of related communications protocols that operate together and, 
as a group, address communication at some or all of the seven layers of the OSI refer-
ence model. Not every protocol stack covers each layer of the model, and often a single 
protocol in the suite addresses a number of layers at once. TCP/IP is a typical protocol 
suite.
repeater
A networking device that exists at Layer 1, the physical layer, of the OSI ref-
erence model. The purpose of a repeater is to regenerate and retime network signals at 
the bit level, allowing them to travel a longer distance on the medium.
ring topology
A topology in which hosts are connected in the form of a ring or circle. 
Unlike the physical bus topology, the ring topology has no beginning or end that needs 
to be terminated.
router
A type of internetworking device that passes data packets between networks 
based on Layer 3 addresses. A router can make decisions regarding the best path for 
delivery of data on the network.

in a network system.
token passing
An access method by which network devices access the physical 
medium in an orderly fashion based on possession of a small frame called a token.
transport layer
Layer 4 of the OSI reference model. This layer is responsible for reli-
able network communication between end nodes. The transport layer provides mecha-
nisms to establish, maintain, and terminate virtual circuits, transport fault detection 
and recovery, and information ﬂow control.
virtual private network (VPN)
A private network constructed within a public net-
work infrastructure such as the global Internet.
wide-area network (WAN)
A data communications network that serves users across 
a broad geographic area and often uses transmission devices provided by common 
carriers.

Chapter 3
Networking Media
The function of the physical layer is to transmit data by deﬁning the electrical, wireless, 
or light speciﬁcations between the source and destination. After it reaches a building, 
low-voltage electricity is carried to workstations, servers, and network devices via wires 
concealed in walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings. Data, which can consist of such things as text, 
pictures, audio, or video, travels through the wires and is represented by the presence of 
either electrical pulses on copper conducting wires or light pulses in optical ﬁbers.
This chapter introduces the basic theory of electricity, which provides a foundation for 
understanding networking at the physical layer of the OSI model. This chapter also dis-
cusses different types of networking media that are used at the physical layer, including 
shielded twisted-pair cable, unshielded twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, and ﬁber-optic 
cable, as well as wireless media.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that 
you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed 
to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Electricity Basics
This section discusses the basic theory of electricity, which provides a foundation for 
understanding networking at the physical layer (Layer 1) of the OSI reference model.
Atoms and Molecules
The basic unit of all matter in the universe is the atom. The atom is made of three tiny 
parts: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons are lumped together in 
a small grouping called a nucleus. The electron ﬂows freely around this nucleus. When 
1102.book  Page 115  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Chapter 3: Networking Media
these three parts come together, they form an atom. The Periodic Table of Elements, as 
shown in Figure 3-1, lists all known types of atoms and their properties. Atoms are 
made up of three basic particles:
■Protons—Particles that have a positive charge
■Neutrons—Particles that have no charge
■Electrons—Particles that have a negative charge
Figure 3-1 Periodic Table of Elements
Atoms normally have equal numbers of protons and electrons. Because the positive 
and negative charges are equal, atoms have no net charge.
Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, developed a simpliﬁed model to illustrate atoms, as shown 
in Figure 3-2. This illustration shows the Bohr model for a helium atom, which has 
two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons. The protons and neutrons form the 
nucleus at the center of the atom, and the electrons are shown in orbit around the nucleus. 
The diagram is not drawn to scale, but if the protons and neutrons of this atom were 
the size of soccer balls in the middle of a soccer ﬁeld, the electrons would be the size of 
cherries, and would be orbiting near the outer-most seats of the stadium. The electrons 
are quite small compared to the nucleus, and the orbit is quite large compared to the 
size of the particles, even though the atoms themselves are microscopic.

Figure 3-2 Bohr Model of a Helium Atom
Atoms bond together in different combinations to form molecules of various types of 
matter. For example, hydrogen and oxygen atoms bond to form water molecules.
Electrical Properties of Matter
The nucleus of an atom is bound together by a very powerful force. Electrons are 
bound to their orbit around the nucleus by a much weaker force. Electrons in certain 
atoms can be pulled away from their orbit and go into orbit around nearby atoms. 
This movement of electrons is deﬁned as electric current.
If an atom loses or gains an electron, it no longer has the same number of electrons 
and protons. Such an atom is called an ion, and it has a net charge since the number 
of protons and electrons is not equal. The charge of an ion exerts a force on nearby 
atoms that can cause them to lose or gain electrons. Thus, as electrons of nearby atoms 
move, current ﬂows through a material.
Atoms and molecules can be classiﬁed as belonging to one of three groups, depending 
on how easily electrons are pulled out of their orbit. These three groups are insulators, 
conductors, and semiconductors. See Table 3-1 for a summary.
Electrical Insulators
Insulators are materials made of atoms or molecules that require a great deal of force to 
remove their electrons from orbit. Examples of electrical insulators include plastic, glass, 
air, dry wood, paper, rubber, helium gas, and pure water (whose atoms are not ions).

Chapter 3: Networking Media
Electrical Conductors
Conductors are materials made of atoms or molecules with electrons that are bound 
very loosely to the nucleus and require little force to remove them from orbit. The 
Periodic Table categorizes groups of atoms, listing them by columns. The best con-
ductors are located in one particular column of Table 3-1: copper (Cu), silver (Ag), 
and gold (Au). Other conductors include lead solder, which is a mixture of lead (Pb) 
and tin (Sn), and water in which some atoms are ions. Because the human body is 
made of approximately 70 percent ionized water, it is also a conductor.
Electrical Semiconductors
Semiconductors are materials made of atoms or molecules with electrons whose move-
ment can be precisely controlled. The most important semiconductor is silicon (Si). Other 
examples from the same column of the Periodic Table include carbon (C) and germa-
nium (Ge). Gallium arsenide (GaAs), a molecule, is also a common semiconductor.
Silicon is common and can be found in sand, glass, and many types of rocks. The region 
around San Jose, California, is known as Silicon Valley because the computer industry, 
which depends on silicon microchips, started in that area. The switches, or gates, inside a 
microprocessor are made up of semiconductors.
Measuring Electricity
As with any other physical process or concept, you need to be able to measure electric-
ity to make use of it. You can measure electricity in numerous ways, but in this section, 
you focus on voltage, current, resistance, and impedance.

Measuring Electricity
119
Voltage
Because electrons and protons have opposite charges, they are attracted to each other 
with a force similar to the attractive force of the north and south poles of two magnets. 
When the charges are separated, this separation creates an attractive force or pressure 
ﬁeld between the charges. This force is voltage. The force that is created pulls toward 
the opposite charge and pushes away from the like charge. This process occurs in a 
battery, where chemical action causes electrons to be freed from the battery’s negative 
terminal and to travel to the opposite, or positive, terminal through an external circuit—
not through the battery itself. The separation of charges results in voltage. Voltage can 
also be created by friction (static electricity), by magnetism (electric generator), or by 
solar energy.
Voltage is represented by the letter V. The unit of measurement for voltage is the volt, 
and it is also represented with the letter V (for example, 12 V = 12 volts).
Two kinds of voltage exist:
■Direct-current (DC) voltage—A battery is an example of a DC voltage source. 
The movement of electrons in a DC circuit is always in the same direction, from 
negative to positive.
■Alternating-current (AC) voltage—In an AC circuit, the positive and negative ter-
minals of the AC voltage source regularly change to negative and positive and 
back again, as shown in Figure 3-3. This change makes the direction of electron 
movement change, or alternate, with respect to time.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
Current
Electrical current is the ﬂow of charges that is created when electrons move. When 
voltage (electrical pressure) is applied and a path for the current exists, electrons move 
from the negative terminal (which repels them), along the path, to the positive terminal 
(which attracts them).
Current is represented by the letter I. The unit of measurement for current is the ampere, 
and it is represented by the letter A, or by the abbreviation amp. An amp is deﬁned as 
the number of charges per second that pass by a point along a path. It can be thought 
of as the amount of electron trafﬁc that is ﬂowing through a circuit; the more electrons 
that pass by any given point in a circuit, the higher the current.
Current that results from DC voltage always ﬂows in the same direction, from negative 
to positive. Current that results from AC voltage ﬂows in one direction, then changes 
direction, and then alternates back to the original direction, and so on.
Wattage
If amperage or current can be thought of as the amount or volume of electron trafﬁc 
that is ﬂowing, then voltage can be thought of as the speed of the electron trafﬁc. The 
combination of amperage (quantity of electrons past a given point) and voltage (pres-
sure or speed of electrons) equals wattage or electrical power. A watt (W) is the basic 
unit of electrical power or work done by electricity. Wattage equals voltage times amper-
age (W = V × I). Electrical devices such as light bulbs, motors, and computer power 
supplies are rated in terms of watts, which is how much power they consume or pro-
duce. It is the current or amperage in an electrical circuit that really does the work. As 
an example, static electricity has very high voltage, so much that it can jump a gap of 
an inch or more. However, it has very low amperage and as a result can create a shock 
but not injure someone. The starter motor in an automobile operates at a relatively 
low 12 volts but requires very high amperage to generate enough energy to turn over 
the engine. Lightning has very high voltage and high amperage and can cause severe 
damage or injury.
Resistance and Impedance
Conductors exchange electrons very easily, so it does not take much voltage to cause 
electrons to move through them. Conversely, the electrons in insulators are bound to 
their orbits much more tightly, so they oppose the movement of electrons. Resistance
is the property of a material that resists electron movement. Conductors have low 
resistance, and insulators have high resistance.
1102.book  Page 120  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Measuring Electricity
121
Resistance is represented by the letter R. The unit of measurement for resistance is the 
ohm, and it is represented by the Greek letter, omega (Ω), because omega sounds like ohm.
The term resistance is generally used when referring to DC circuits. The resistance to 
the movement of electrons in an AC circuit is called impedance. Impedance is repre-
sented by the letter Z. Like resistance, its unit of measurement is the ohm, represented 
by Ω.
Circuits
Electrons move best through conductive materials. Although air in a dry climate can 
be conductive, as noticed through shocks of static electricity, electrons cannot jump 
across air from a battery to an unconnected, nearby piece of copper wire. Current, or 
electron movement, occurs only in circuits that form complete loops. These circuits are 
known as closed circuits.
Figure 3-4 shows a simple circuit, typical of a lantern-style ﬂashlight. The switch is like 
two ends of a single wire that can be opened (or broken) and then closed (or shorted) 
to prevent or allow current.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
The top of Figure 3-4 illustrates the ﬂashlight with its switch turned off. The chemical 
processes in the battery cause charges to be separated, which provides voltage. How-
ever, because is no complete path for electron movement exists, there is no current, 
and the bulb will not be lit.
As shown in the bottom of Figure 3-4, the switch is turned on, and a complete path of 
conductive wire for current exists. The bulb provides resistance to the ﬂow of electrons, 
causing the current to release energy in the form of light.
The circuits involved in networking use the same concepts as this very simple circuit, 
but networking circuits are much more complex. When you are learning a new concept, 
it is often helpful to relate the concept to a familiar example. The circuit discussed pre-
viously can be compared to a water circuit, as illustrated in Figure 3-5. The pressure 
that causes water ﬂow comes from the weight of the water in the tank. The tap can be 
compared with the switch in the previous example. When the tap is turned off, it blocks 
water from moving. When the tap is turned on, it allows water to move and also pro-
vides resistance to the ﬂow of water, because a small tap will allow a lesser ﬂow than a 
large tap. Finally, the pipe provides a closed path for the ﬂow of water to cycle back 
into the tank.

Copper Media
123
Copper Media
Copper is the most common medium for signal wiring. Copper wires are the components 
of a cable that carry the signals from the source computer to the destination computer. 
Copper has several important properties that make it well suited for electronic cabling:
■Conductivity—Copper is perhaps best known for its ability to conduct electric 
current. Copper is also an excellent conductor of heat. This property makes it 
useful in cooking utensils, radiators, and refrigerators.
■Corrosion resistance—Copper does not rust and is fairly resistant to corrosion; 
the copper corrodes as copper oxide at a somewhat slower pace than other metals.
■Ductility—Copper possesses great ductility, the ability to be drawn into thin wires 
without breaking. For example, copper rod that is 1 centimeter (cm) in diameter 
can be heated, rolled, and drawn into a wire that is thinner than a human hair.
■Malleability—Pure copper is highly malleable (easy to shape). It does not crack 
when hammered, stamped, forged, or spun into unusual shapes. Copper can be 
worked (shaped) when it is hot or cold.
■Strength—Cold-rolled copper has a tensile strength 3500 to 4900 kilograms 
per square centimeter. Copper keeps its strength and toughness up to about 400° 
Fahrenheit (F) (204° Celsius [C]).
This section focuses on two types of copper cable used for networks:
■Twisted-pair—Twisted-pair cables are composed of one or more pairs of copper 
wires. Most data and voice networks use twisted-pair cabling.
■Coaxial—Coaxial cable has one center conductor of either solid or stranded 
copper wire. Coaxial cable, once the choice for local-area network (LAN) 
cabling, is now used primarily for video connections, high-speed connections 
such as T3 (or E3) lines, and cable television.
American Wire Gauge System
The diameter of cable wires or conductors is commonly measured using the American 
wire gauge (AWG) system. AWG is a U.S. standard for measuring the diameter of pri-
marily copper and aluminum cable. Typical residential wiring is AWG 12 or 14. The 
conductor or wire size used in the UTP in most telephone local loops (from the central 
ofﬁce to a home or residence) is between 19 and 26 AWG. Most newer telephone wire 
is from 22 to 26 gauge with 24 gauge being the most common. The lower the gauge 
number the thicker the wire. Thicker wire has less resistance and can carry more cur-
rent resulting in a better signal over longer distances. A wire with an AWG size of 24 
would be 1/24th of an inch in diameter.
1102.book  Page 123  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

124
Chapter 3: Networking Media
Twisted-Pair Cable
Twisted-pair cable is a type of cabling that is used for telephone communications and 
most modern Ethernet networks. A pair of wires forms a circuit that can transmit data. 
The pairs are twisted to provide protection against crosstalk, the noise generated by 
adjacent pairs.
The wire pairs are twisted for two reasons. First, when a wire is carrying a current, 
that current creates a magnetic ﬁeld around the wire. This ﬁeld can interfere with sig-
nals on nearby wires. To combat this, pairs of wires carry signals in opposite directions, 
so that the two magnetic ﬁelds also occur in opposite directions and cancel each other 
out. This process is known as cancellation. Twisting the pairs holds the two wires closer 
together and helps to ensure effective cancellation within the cable.
Second, network data is sent using two wires in a twisted pair. One copy of the data is 
sent on each wire, and the two copies are mirror images of each other. These signals 
are called differential signals. If the two wires are twisted together, noise seen on one 
wire is also be seen on the other wire. When the data is received, one copy is inverted, 
and the two signals are then compared. In this manner the receiver can ﬁlter out noise 
because the noise signals cancel each other.
Two basic types of twisted-pair cable exist: shielded twisted-pair (STP) and unshielded 
twisted-pair (UTP). The following sections discuss UTP and STP cable in more detail.
Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable
Shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable contains four pairs of thin, copper wires covered in 
color-coded plastic insulation that are twisted together. Each pair is wrapped in metallic 
foil, and then the four pairs are collectively wrapped in another layer of metallic braid 
or foil. This layer is wrapped with a plastic outer jacket. Figure 3-6 illustrates an 
example of STP.

Copper Media
125
Screened twisted-pair (ScTP), also known as foil twisted-pair (FTP), is a variation of 
STP. ScTP is essentially STP with just one layer of foil shielding around the set of all 
four-wire pairs, as shown in Figure 3-7. The shielding in both STP and ScTP reduces 
unwanted electrical noise. This noise reduction provides a major advantage of STP 
over unshielded cable.
Figure 3-7 Screened Twisted-Pair Cable
However, shielded cable is more difﬁcult to install than unshielded cable because the 
metallic shielding needs to be grounded. If improperly installed, STP and ScTP become 
very susceptible to noise problems because an ungrounded shield acts like an antenna, 
picking up unwanted signals. STP and ScTP cable cannot be run as far as coaxial and 
ﬁber-optic cable without the use of repeaters. The insulation and shielding consider-
ably increase the size, weight, and cost of the cable. Despite these disadvantages, 
shielded copper cable is still used as networking media today, especially in Europe.
The following summarizes the features of STP cable:
■Speed and throughput—10 to 100 Mbps
■Average cost per node—Moderately expensive
■Media and connector size—Medium to large
■Maximum cable length—100 meters (m) (short)
Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable
Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable is a common networking media. It consists of 
four pairs of thin, copper wires covered in color-coded plastic insulation that are 
twisted together, as shown in Figure 3-8. The wire pairs are then covered with a plastic 
outer jacket. The connector used on a UTP cable is called a registered jack 45 (RJ-45) 
connector, as shown in Figure 3-9.

UTP cable has many advantages. It has a small diameter and does not require ground-
ing, so it is the easiest type of cable to install. Its size provides an additional advantage 
because more UTP cable can ﬁt in a given area than other copper media. It is also the 
least expensive type of networking media, and the connector is the easiest to build. It 
supports the same data speeds as other copper media.
The primary disadvantage to UTP is that it is more susceptible to electrical noise and 
interference than any other type of networking media. Because it has no shielding, it 
relies solely on the cancellation and differential signals to reduce the effects of noise. 
The other main disadvantage is that its maximum run length is less than that allowed 
for coaxial and ﬁber-optic cables.

Although UTP was once considered to be slower at transmitting data than other types 
of cable, this is no longer true. In fact, UTP is considered the fastest copper-based 
medium today. The following summarizes the features of UTP cable:
■Speed and throughput—10 to 1000 Mbps
■Average cost per node—Least expensive
■Media and connector size—Small
■Maximum cable length—100 m (short)
Commonly used types of UTP cabling are as follows:
■Category 1 (CAT 1)—Used for telephone communications. Not suitable for 
transmitting data.
■Category 2 (CAT 2)—Capable of transmitting data at speeds up to 4 Mbps.
■Category 3 (CAT 3)—Used in 10BASET Ethernet networks. Can transmit data at 
speeds up to 10 Mbps.
■Category 4 (CAT 4)—Used in Token Ring networks. Can transmit data at speeds 
up to 16 Mbps.
■Category 5 (CAT 5)—Can transmit data at speeds up to 100 Mbps. Used in Fast 
Ethernet networks.
■Category 5e (CAT 5e)—Used in networks running at speeds up to 1000 Mbps 
(1 Gbps). Used in Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) networks.
■Category 6 (CAT 6)—The speciﬁcation for CAT 6 is new, was released on 
February 3, 2003, and is currently available for installation and use. Used in 
Gigabit Ethernet (GigE) networks.
Typically, CAT 5 and higher network cable consists of four pairs of 24 AWG multi-
strand copper wires. Older cabling installations run CAT 3 for voice and CAT 5 for 
data. Most new installations run a minimum of CAT 5e for voice and data. Although 
CAT 5e costs a little more it is worth it in the long run.
When comparing UTP and STP, keep the following points in mind:
■The speed of both types of cable is usually satisfactory for local-area distances.
■These are the least-expensive media for data communication. UTP is less expen-
sive than STP.
■Because most buildings are already wired with UTP, many transmission standards 
are adapted to use it to avoid costly rewiring with an alternative cable type. You 
must take care to ensure that the category level of the cable is adequate to handle 
the bandwidth desired. As an example, a building wired with CAT 3 cable cannot 
support Fast Ethernet, which requires at least CAT 5.

Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable, as shown in Figure 3-10, consists of four main parts:
■Copper conductor
■Plastic insulation
■Braided copper shielding
■Outer jacket
At the center of the cable is a solid copper conductor. Surrounding that conductor is 
a layer of ﬂexible plastic insulation. A woven copper braid or metallic foil is wrapped 
around the insulation. This layer acts as the second wire in the cable. It also acts as 
a shield for the inner conductor and helps reduce the amount of outside interference. 
Covering this shield is the outer cable jacket. The connector used on coaxial cable 
is called a BNC, short for British Naval Connector or Bayonet Neill Concelman, 
connector.
Figure 3-10 Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable was a popular choice with LANs in the past. It offered several advantages. 
It can be run with fewer boosts from repeaters for longer distances between network 
nodes than either STP or UTP cable. Although more expensive than UTP, coaxial cable 
is less expensive than ﬁber-optic cable. The technology is well known, because it has 
been used for many years in various types of data communication. For example, coaxial 
cable is commonly used in homes to deliver cable television signals and high-speed 
Internet access. For cable TV, RG-59 is commonly used inside the home and has a center 
conductor of 20 AWG. RG-6 is most often used from the street pedestal to the home 
due to heavier shielding and a larger center conductor of 18 AWG. RG-11 cable is heavier 
still with a center conductor of 14 AWG and is used to bring cable into neighborhoods.

When working with cable, consider its size. As the diameter of the cable increases, 
so does the difﬁculty in working with it because cable must be pulled through existing 
conduits that are limited in size. Coaxial cable comes in several sizes. The largest diam-
eter (1 cm) was once speciﬁed for use as Ethernet backbone cable because it had a 
greater transmission length and better noise rejection characteristics than other types 
of cable. This type of coaxial cable is frequently referred to as thicknet, as shown in 
Figure 3-11. As its nickname suggests, thicknet cable can be too rigid to install easily 
in some situations because of its thickness. The general rule is that the more difﬁcult 
the network medium is to install, the more expensive it is to install. Coaxial cable is 
more expensive to install than twisted-pair cable. Thicknet cable is almost never used 
except for special-purpose installations.
Figure 3-11 Coaxial Cable—Thicknet
Coaxial cable with a diameter of 0.35 cm, sometimes referred to as thinnet, was also 
frequently used in Ethernet networks at one time. Thinnet, as shown in Figure 3-12, 
was especially useful for cable installations that required the cable to make many twists 
and turns. Because it was easier to install, it was also cheaper to install. Thus, it was 
sometimes referred to as Cheapernet.

However, in both types of coaxial cable, the outer conductor must be carefully and 
properly grounded, which increases the complexity of the installation. It is for this rea-
son that, despite its advantages, coaxial cable is no longer commonly used in Ethernet 
networks.
Although many bus topology networks still utilize coaxial cable in use throughout the 
world, the IEEE no longer recommends this cable or topology as a standard for use 
with Ethernet. Nearly all new LANs use Ethernet extended star topology and a combi-
nation of UTP and ﬁber.
The following summarizes the features of coaxial cables:
■Speed and throughput—10 to 100 Mbps
■Average cost per node—Inexpensive
■Media and connector size—Medium
■Maximum cable length—500 m (medium)
Cable Speciﬁcation and Termination
Speciﬁcations, or standards, are sets of rules or procedures that are widely used and 
serve as the accepted method of performing a task. For example, the OSI reference model 
standards help to ensure that networking devices around the world are compatible and 
will work together. Many speciﬁcations exist for cabling to ensure interoperability, safety, 
and performance.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) has outlined LAN cabling 
speciﬁcations. IEEE 802.3 is a standard for Ethernet networks, and IEEE 802.5 is a 
Token Ring network standard. The Underwriters Laboratories issues standards that 
are primarily concerned with safety.
More Information: Plenum  Cable
Plenum cable is the cable that runs in plenum spaces of a building. In building construction, a 
plenum (pronounced PLEH-nuhm, from Latin meaning “full”) is a separate space provided for 
air circulation for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (sometimes referred to as HVAC), 
typically in the space between the structural ceiling and a drop-down ceiling. In buildings with 
computer installations, the plenum space often is used to house connecting communication 
cables. Because ordinary cable introduces a toxic hazard in the event of ﬁre, special plenum 
cabling is required in plenum areas.
Plenum cable sheathing is often is made of Teﬂon and is more expensive than ordinary cabling. 
Its outer material is more resistant to ﬂames and, when burning, produces less smoke than 
ordinary cabling. Both twisted-pair and coaxial cable are made in plenum cable versions.

The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries 
Association (EIA) have jointly issued cabling standards often called TIA/EIA standards. 
The list that follows describes some of the TIA/EIA standards:
■TIA/EIA-568-B—This is a commercial building telecommunication cabling 
standard.
■TIA/EIA-569-B—Formerly the TIA/EIA-568-A standard. This is a commercial 
building standard for telecommunications pathways and spaces.
■TIA/EIA-570-A—This is a residential and light commercial telecommunications 
wiring standard.
■TIA/EIA-606—This is an administration standard for the telecommunications 
infrastructure of commercial buildings.
■TIA/EIA-607—This is a commercial building grounding and bonding require-
ment for telecommunications.
The speciﬁcations created by this organization have had the greatest impact on net-
working media standards and include standards for horizontal and backbone (vertical) 
cabling, wiring closets and equipment rooms, work areas, and entrance facilities. The 
TIA/EIA standards allow for the planning and installation of LAN equipment in a way 
that allows network designers the freedom to choose the devices needed while assuring 
the operability of the LAN design.
The TIA/EIA-568-B standard focuses on horizontal cabling, which is cabling that runs 
from a wall outlet at a work area to a wiring closet. There are ﬁve historic categories 
for cable (CAT 1 through CAT 5), and of these, only CAT 3, CAT 4, and CAT 5 meet 
the TIA/EIA-568-B standard. CAT 5 cable is the most frequently installed. Recent stan-
dards have been developed for CAT 5e and CAT 6, and a new standard for CAT 7 
cabling is also underway. These new standards offer improvements to CAT 5 and are 
becoming more common.
TIA/EIA-568-B calls for two cables to each work area outlet:
■A telephone cable for voice
■A network cable for data
The voice cable must be a 2-pair UTP cable with its correct connectors, or terminators. 
The network cable must be one of the following and must include the correct connectors, 
or terminators:
■150 ohm STP 2-pair cable (Token Ring LANs)
■100 ohm UTP 4-pair cable (Ethernet LANs)
■62.5/125 µ ﬁber-optic cable (Ethernet LANs)

Chapter 3: Networking Media
■Coaxial cable (rarely used for new installations and expected to be removed 
from this list the next time the standard is updated)
Although not part of the standard, a coaxial 75 ohm RG-6 cable can also be run 
for cable TV connection, in addition to the minimum voice and data connections if 
desired.
The standard also speciﬁes the maximum length of each cabling run from the wall out-
let to the wiring closet connections for UTP cabling. A 3-meter patch cord is speciﬁed 
from the workstation to the wall outlet. A 90-meter cable run is allowed from the wall 
outlet to the patch panel in the wiring closet. A 6-meter patch cord is permitted from 
the patch panel to the horizontal cross connect in the wiring closet. This standard 
ensures that the entire cable run does not exceed 100 meters.

Optical Media
Optical ﬁber is the most frequently used medium for the longer, high bandwidth, point-
to-point transmissions required on LAN backbones and on wide-area networks (WANs). 
Very good reasons exist for the popularity of ﬁber.
Optical ﬁber is used in networks because
■Fiber is not susceptible to lightning, electromagnetic interference (EMI), or 
radio frequency interference (RFI), and it does not generate EMI or RFI.
■Fiber has much greater bandwidth capabilities than other media.
■Fiber allows signiﬁcantly greater transmission distances and excellent signal 
quality because very little signal attenuation occurs.
■Fiber is more secure than other media because it is difﬁcult to tap into a ﬁber 
and easy to detect someone’s placing a tap on the ﬁber.
■Current ﬁber transmitter and receiver technologies can be replaced by newer, 
faster devices as they are developed so that greater transmission speeds can be 
achieved over existing ﬁber links with no need to replace the ﬁber.
■Fiber costs less than copper for long distance applications.
■The raw material that ﬁber is made from is sand, a plentiful substance.
■With ﬁber, you have no grounding concerns as you have when signaling using 
electricity.
■Fiber is light in weight and easily installed.
■Fiber has better resistance to environmental factors, like water, than copper wire.
■Lengths of ﬁber can easily be spliced together for very long cable runs.
For these reasons, when very large numbers of bits need to be sent over distances 
greater than 100 meters, ﬁber-optic ﬁber is often used.
This section explains the basics of ﬁber-optic cable. You learn about how ﬁbers can 
guide light for long distances. You also learn about the types of cable used, how ﬁber is 
installed, the type of connectors and equipment used with ﬁber-optic cable, and how 
ﬁber is tested to ensure that it functions properly.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum
The light used in optical ﬁber networks is one type of electromagnetic energy. When an 
electric charge moves back and forth or accelerates, a type of energy called electromag-
netic energy is produced. This energy, in the form of waves, can travel through a vacuum, 
the air, and through some materials like glass. An important property of any energy 
wave is its wavelength, as shown in Figure 3-13.
Figure 3-13 Wavelength
To human beings, radio, microwaves, radar, visible light, X rays, and gamma rays 
seem to be very different things, but they are all types of electromagnetic energy. If all 
the types of electromagnetic waves are arranged in order from waves with the longest 
wavelength down to those waves with the shortest wavelength, it creates a continuum 
called the Electromagnetic Spectrum, as shown in Figure 3-14.
Figure 3-14 Electromagnetic Spectrum
The wavelength of an electromagnetic wave is determined by how frequently the elec-
tric charge that generates the wave moves back and forth. For example, if the charge 
moves back and forth slowly, it generates a long wavelength. Visualize the movement 
of the electric charge as like that of a stick in a pool of water. If the stick is moved back 
 

Optical Media
135
and forth slowly, it generates ripples in the water with a long wavelength between the 
tops of the ripples. If the stick is moved back and forth more rapidly, the ripples have a 
shorter wavelength.
Because electromagnetic waves are all generated in the same way, all electromagnetic 
waves share many of the same properties. For example, they all travel at the same rate 
of speed through a vacuum, about 300,000 kilometers per second or 186,000 miles 
per second or the speed of light.
Human eyes can sense electromagnetic energy only with wavelengths between 700 
nanometers and about 400 nanometers. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter 
(0.000000001 m) in length and is abbreviated nm. Electromagnetic energy with wave-
lengths between 700 nm and 400 nm is called visible light. The longer wavelengths of 
light (those around 700 nm) are seen as the color red. The shortest wavelengths (around 
400 nm) appear as the color violet. This part of the electromagnetic spectrum is seen as 
the colors in a rainbow.
To transmit data over optical ﬁber, wavelengths that are not visible to the human eye 
are used. These wavelengths are slightly longer than red light and are called infrared
light. Infrared light is used in TV remote controls. The wavelength of the light in opti-
cal ﬁber is one of the following wavelengths:
■850 nm
■1310 nm
■1550 nm
These wavelengths were selected because they travel better through optical ﬁber than 
other wavelengths.
The Ray Model of Light
When electromagnetic waves, including light, travel out from the source, they travel in 
straight lines. These straight lines pointing out from the source are called rays.
Think of light rays as narrow beams of light like those produced by lasers. In the vacuum 
of empty space, light travels continuously in a straight line at 300,000 kilometers per 
second. However, light travels at different, slower speeds through other materials like 
air, water, and glass. When a light ray (called the incident ray) crosses the boundary 
from one material (air, for example) to another (glass, for example), some of the light 
energy in the ray is reﬂected back. That is why you can see yourself in a mirror. The 
light that is reﬂected back is called the reﬂected ray.
1102.book  Page 135  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

136
Chapter 3: Networking Media
The light energy in the incident ray that is not reﬂected enters the glass. The entering 
ray is usually bent at an angle from its original path. This ray is called the refracted
ray. How much the incident light ray is bent depends on two factors:
■The angle at which the incident ray strikes the surface of the glass
■The different rates of speed at which light travels through the two substances 
(air and glass in this example)
The bending of light rays at the boundary of two substances is the reason why light 
rays are able to travel through an optical ﬁber even if the ﬁber curves in a circle.
How much rays of light in glass bend is determined by the optical density of the glass. 
Optical density refers to how much a light ray is slowed down by passing through a 
substance. The greater the optical density of a material, the more it slows light down 
from its speed in a vacuum. The ratio of the speed of light in a material to the speed of 
light in a vacuum is called the material’s index of refraction (IR) and is expressed as 
follows:
Therefore, the measure of a material’s optical density is that material’s index of refrac-
tion. A material with a large index of refraction is more optically dense and slows light 
down more than a material with a smaller index of refraction.
Table 3-2 shows the IR of air, glass, diamond, and water.
For a substance like glass, the index of refraction (the optical density) can be made 
larger by adding chemicals to the glass. The index of refraction can be made smaller 
by making the glass very pure.
In the next two sections, you learn more about the reﬂection and refraction that help 
you to understand the design and operation of optical ﬁbers.

The Law of Reﬂection
When light travels through a medium like air and strikes another medium like glass, 
the light either reﬂects off the surface or passes into or through the second medium, as 
shown in Figure 3-15. It depends on the angle it strikes the surface. The angle between 
the incident ray and a line perpendicular to the surface of the glass at the point where 
the incident ray strikes the glass is called the angle of incidence. When this angle of 
incidence reaches a certain point, called the critical angle, all the light is reﬂected back 
into the original medium, as illustrated in Figure 3-16.
Figure 3-15 Reﬂection
Figure 3-16 Critical Angel
The perpendicular line is called the normal. It is not a light ray but a tool to allow the 
measurement of angles. The angle between the reﬂected ray and the normal is called 
the angle of reﬂection. The Law of Reﬂection states that the angle of reﬂection of a 
light ray is equal to its angle of incidence. In other words, the angle at which a light ray 
strikes a reﬂective surface determines the angle that the ray reﬂects off the surface.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
The Law of Refraction (Snell’s Law)
When light strikes the interface between two transparent materials like air and glass, 
the light divides into two parts. Part of the light ray is reﬂected back into the ﬁrst 
substance (the air), with the angle of reﬂection equaling the angle of incidence. The 
remaining energy in the light ray crosses the interface and enters into the second sub-
stance (the glass).
If the incident ray strikes the glass surface at exactly a 90-degree angle, the ray goes 
straight into the glass. The ray is not bent. But, if the angle of incidence is not exactly 
90 degrees, then the ray that enters the glass (the transmitted ray) is bent. We call this 
bending of the entering ray refraction. How much the ray is bent (refracted) depends 
on the index of refraction of the two transparent materials. If the light ray travels from 
a substance whose index of refraction is smaller into a substance where the index of 
refraction is larger, the refracted ray is bent towards the normal. If the light ray travels 
from a substance where the index of refraction is larger into a substance where the index 
of refraction is smaller, the refracted ray is bent away from the normal. Figure 3-17 
illustrates an example of refraction.
Figure 3-17 Refraction
For example, consider a light ray moving at some angle other than 90 degrees through 
the boundary between glass and a diamond, as shown in Figure 3-18. The glass has an 
index of refraction of about 1.523. The diamond has an index of refraction of about 
2.419. Therefore, the ray that continues into the diamond is bent towards the normal. 
When that light ray crosses the boundary between the diamond and the air at some 
angle other than 90 degrees, it is bent away from the normal. The reason for this is 
that air has a lower index of refraction (about 1.000) than does diamond.

Figure 3-18 Refraction Example
Total Internal Reﬂection
A light ray that is being turned on and off to send data 1s and 0s into an optical ﬁber 
must stay inside the ﬁber until it reaches the far end. The ray must not refract into the 
material wrapped around the outside of the ﬁber because such refraction causes the 
loss of part of the ray’s light energy. A design for the ﬁber that makes the outside sur-
face of the ﬁber act like a mirror to the light ray moving through the ﬁber must be 
achieved. If any light ray that tries to move out through the side of the ﬁber is reﬂected 
back into the ﬁber at an angle that sends it towards the far end of the ﬁber, this is a 
good pipe or wave guide for the light waves, as illustrated in Figure 3-19.
Figure 3-19 Total Internal Reﬂection
The laws of reﬂection and refraction tell how to design a ﬁber that guides the light waves 
through the ﬁber with a minimum energy loss. Two conditions are needed to cause 
light rays in a ﬁber to be reﬂected back into the ﬁber with out any loss due to refrac-
tion. These two conditions are as follows:
■The core (the inside) of the optical ﬁber has to have a larger (a higher) index of 
refraction than the material that surrounds it. The material that surrounds the 
core of the ﬁber is called the cladding.
■The angle of incidence of the light ray is greater than the critical angle for the 
core and its cladding.
When both of these conditions are met, all the incident light in the ﬁber is reﬂected back 
inside the ﬁber. This condition is called total internal reﬂection, which is the foundation 
on which optical ﬁber is constructed. Total internal reﬂection causes the light rays in the

ﬁber to bounce off the core-cladding boundary and continue their journey toward the 
far end of the ﬁber. The light follows something of a zigzag path through the core of 
the ﬁber.
A ﬁber that meets the ﬁrst condition (a core with a higher index of refraction than the 
cladding) can be easily created. Also, the angle of incidence of the light rays that enter 
the core can be controlled. Restricting two factors controls the angle of incidence:
■The numerical aperture of the ﬁber. The numerical aperture of a core is the range 
of angles of incident light rays entering the ﬁber that are totally internally 
reﬂected, as illustrated in Figure 3-20.
■The paths (called the modes) that a light ray can follow when traveling down a 
ﬁber.
Figure 3-20 Numerical Aperture
Controlling conditions 1 and 2 creates a ﬁber with total internal reﬂection, consequently 
giveing a light wave path that can be used for data communications, as shown in 
Figure 3-21.

Fiber-Optic Cables
Fiber-optic cable is a networking medium that uses modulated light for data transmis-
sions through thin strands of glass. Signals that represent data bits are converted into 
beams of light. It is important to recognize that while electricity is required to generate 
and interpret the ﬁber-optic signals at the end devices, no electricity is in the cable itself 
as there is with copper media. In fact, ﬁber-optic cable components are very good insu-
lators. Many characteristics of ﬁber-optic media are superior to copper.
Every ﬁber-optic cable used for networking consists of two glass ﬁbers encased in sep-
arate sheaths. One ﬁber carries transmitted data from device A to device B; the second 
ﬁber carries data from device B to device A. A ﬁber for data goes in each direction, 
similar to two one-way streets going in opposite directions. This arrangement provides 
a full-duplex communication link. Just as copper twisted-pair uses separate wire pairs 
to transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx), ﬁber-optic circuits use one ﬁber strand to transmit 
and one to receive, as illustrated in Figure 3-22. Typically, these two ﬁber cables are in 
a single outer jacket until they reach the point at which connectors are attached.
Figure 3-22 Duplex Fiber
At this point, the two ﬁber cables are separated. No need for twisting or shielding 
exists because no light escapes when it is inside a ﬁber, which means no crosstalk issues 
exist with ﬁber. It is common to see multiple ﬁber pairs encased in the same cable. This 
arrangement allows a single cable to be run between data closets, ﬂoors, or buildings. 
One cable can contain 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, or more separate ﬁbers. With copper, one 
UTP cable has to be pulled for each circuit. Fiber can carry many more bits per second 
and carry them farther than copper can.
As illustrated in Figure 3-23 and Figure 3-24, ﬁve parts typically make up each ﬁber-
optic cable:
■The core
■The cladding
■A buffer
■A strengthening material
■An outer jacket

Figure 3-23 Five Elements of a Fiber-Optic Cable
Figure 3-24 Cross Section Showing the Five Elements of a Fiber-Optic Cable
The core is the light transmission element at the center of the optical ﬁber, and all the 
light signals travel through the core. This core is typically glass made from a combina-
tion of silica (silicon dioxide) and other elements. Surrounding the core is the cladding, 
also made of silica but with a lower index of refraction than the core. Light rays travel-
ing through the ﬁber core reﬂect off this core-to-cladding interface where the core and 
cladding meet, which keeps light in the core as it travels down the ﬁber.
Surrounding the cladding is a buffer material, usually plastic, that helps shield the core 
and cladding from damage.
The strengthening material surrounds the buffer, preventing the ﬁber cable from being 
stretched when installers pull it. The material used is often Kevlar, the same material 
used to produce bulletproof vests. The ﬁnal element, the outer jacket, surrounds the 
cable to protect the ﬁber against abrasion, solvents, and other contaminants. This outer 
jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage.

The part of an optical ﬁber through which light rays travel is called the core of the ﬁber. 
Light rays cannot enter the core of an optical ﬁber at all angles. The rays can enter the 
core only if their angle is inside the ﬁber’s numerical aperture. Likewise, once the rays 
have entered the ﬁber’s core, a limited number of optical paths exist that a light ray can 
follow through the ﬁber. These optical paths are called modes. If the diameter of a ﬁber’s 
core is large enough so that many paths exist that light can take as it passes through 
the ﬁber, the ﬁber is called multimode ﬁber. Single-mode ﬁber has a much smaller core 
that allows light rays to travel along only one path (one mode) inside the ﬁber. Figure 3-25 
illustrates the differences between multimode and single-mode ﬁbers.
Figure 3-25 Single-Mode Versus Multimode
Table 3-3 compares the features of single-mode and multimode ﬁber.
The next two sections cover the two basic types of optical ﬁber, multimode and single-
mode, in more detail.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
Multimode Fiber
Multimode ﬁber allows multiple modes (paths) of light to propagate through the ﬁber-
optic core, as compared to single-mode ﬁber, which allows only one mode. Multiple 
modes of light propagating through ﬁber might travel different distances, depending 
on their entry angles. This angle causes them to arrive at the destination (receiving 
end of the cable) at slightly different times—a phenomenon called modal dispersion.
Multimode uses a type of glass, called graded index glass, which has a lower index of 
refraction towards the outer edge of the core. This glass causes the light to slow down 
when passing through the center of the core and accelerate when passing through the 
outer areas of the core, ensuring that all modes of light reach the end at approximately 
the same time. This design is used because a light ray following a mode that goes straight 
down the center of the core does not have to go as far as a ray following a mode that 
bounces around in the ﬁber. All rays should arrive at the end of the ﬁber together. Then, 
the receiver at the end of the ﬁber receives a strong ﬂash of light rather than a long, 
dim pulse.
A standard multimode ﬁber-optic cable (the most common type of ﬁber-optic cable used 
in LANs) uses an optical ﬁber with either a 62.5- or a 50-micron core and a 125-micron 
diameter cladding. This cable is commonly designated as 62.5/125 or 50/125 micron 
optical ﬁber. A micron is one millionth of a meter. Because the diameter of the cladding 
is considerably larger than the wavelength of the light being transmitted, the light 
bounces around (reﬂects) inside the core as it is propagated along the transmission line.
Infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) or vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) 
are usually the light source used with multimode ﬁber. LEDs are a little cheaper to 
build and require somewhat less safety concerns than lasers. However, LEDs cannot 
transmit light over cable as far as the lasers. Multimode ﬁber (62.5/125) can carry data 
distances of up to 2000 meters (6560 feet). Multimode ﬁber is mainly used in LAN 
applications including backbone cabling.

Single-Mode Fiber
Single-mode ﬁber uses only one mode of light to propagate through the ﬁber-optic 
core. In single-mode ﬁber-optic cabling, the core is much smaller than in multimode. 
The single-mode core is 8 to 10 microns in diameter. Nine micron cores are the most 
common. A 9/125 marking on a single-mode ﬁber’s jacket indicates that the core ﬁber 
has a diameter of 9 microns and the surrounding cladding is 125 microns in diameter.
The size of the core in single-mode ﬁber leaves very little room for light to bounce 
around. Furthermore, a very focused infrared laser is used as the light source in single-
mode ﬁber. The ray of light it generates enters the core at a 90-degree angle. As a result 
the data carrying light ray pulses in single-mode ﬁber are essentially transmitted in a 
straight line right down the middle of the core, as shown in Figure 3-26. This greatly 
increases both the speed and the distance that data can be transmitted.
Figure 3-26 Single-Mode Fiber
Because of its design, single-mode ﬁber is capable of higher rates of data transmission 
(bandwidth) and greater cable run distances than multimode ﬁber. Single-mode ﬁber 
can carry LAN data up to 3000 meters. Multimode is only capable of up to 2000 meters. 
Lasers and single-mode ﬁbers are more expensive than LEDs and multimode ﬁber. 
Because of these characteristics, single-mode ﬁber is often used for interbuilding con-
nectivity or WANs (for example, telephone company network connections).
Figure 3-27 compares the relative sizes of the core and cladding for both types of ﬁber-
optic cable in different sectional views. The much smaller and more reﬁned ﬁber core 
in single-mode ﬁber, although it entails more manufacturing costs, is the reason single-
mode has a higher bandwidth and cable run distance than multimode ﬁber.
Figure 3-27 Single-Mode and Multimode Fiber
WARNING
Be aware that the 
laser light used with 
single-mode has a 
longer wavelength 
than can be seen, and 
it is so strong that it 
can seriously damage 
eyes. Never look at 
the end of a ﬁber that 
is connected to a device 
at its far end. Never 
look into the transmit 
port on a NIC, switch, 
or router. There is 
nothing that can be 
seen anyway. Remem-
ber to keep protective 
covers over the ends 
of ﬁber and inserted 
into the ﬁber-optic 
ports of switches 
and routers. Be very 
careful!

Chapter 3: Networking Media
The following summarizes the features of ﬁber-optic cables:
■Speed and throughput—More than 1 Gbps
■Average cost per node—Expensive
■Media and connector size—Small
■Maximum cable length—More than 10 kilometers (km) for single mode; up to 
2 km for multimode
Cable Designs
As illustrated in Figure 3-28, two basic cable designs exist:
■Loose-tube
■Tight-buffered
Figure 3-28 Loose-Tube Versus Tight-Buffer Construction
Tight-buffered cables have the buffering material that surrounds the cladding in direct 
contact with the cladding. The main practical difference between the two designs is the 
applications for which they are used. Loose-tube cable is primarily used for outside-
building installations, while tight-buffered cable is used inside buildings. Most of the 
ﬁber used in LANs is tight-buffered multimode cable.

Other Optical Networking Components
Most of the data sent over a LAN is in the form of electrical signals. But, optical ﬁber 
links use light to send data. So, something is needed to convert the electricity to light 
and, at the other end of the ﬁber, convert the light back to electricity. This situation 
means that two devices are always required: a transmitter and a receiver.
In addition to transmitters and receivers, this section also discusses different types of 
ﬁber-optic cable connectors as well as devices used in optical networking.
Transmitters
The transmitter receives data to be transmitted from switches and routers. This data 
is in the form of electrical signals. The transmitter converts the electronic signals into 
their equivalent light pulses. Two types of light sources encode and transmit the data 
through the cable. These two sources are
■Light emitting diodes (LEDs)—An LED produces infrared light with wavelengths 
of either 850 or 1310 nm. These are used with multimode ﬁber in LANs. Lenses 
are used to focus the infrared light on the end of the ﬁber. LEDs have fewer safety 
concerns.
■Light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission radiation (Laser)—Laser is a light 
source producing a thin beam of intense infrared light usually with wavelengths 
of 1310 or 1550 nm. Lasers are used with single-mode ﬁber over the longer dis-
tances involved in WANs or campus backbones. Exercise extra care to prevent 
eye injury.
Each light source can be lighted and darkened quickly to send data 1s and 0s at a high 
number of bits per second.
Receiver
At the other end of the optical ﬁber from the transmitter is the receiver. It functions 
something like the photoelectric cell in a solar-powered calculator. When light strikes 
the receiver, it produces electricity. The ﬁrst job of the receiver is to detect a light pulse 
that arrives from the ﬁber. Then the receiver converts the light pulse back into the orig-
inal electrical signal that ﬁrst entered the transmitter at the far end of the ﬁber. Now 
the signal is again in the form of voltage changes. The signal is ready to be sent over 
copper wire into any receiving electronic device such as a computer, switch, or router. 
The semiconductor devices that are usually used as receivers with ﬁber-optic links are 
called p-intrinsic-n diodes (PIN photodiodes).
PIN photodiodes are manufactured to be sensitive to the particular wavelength of light 
(850, 1310, or 1550 nm) generated by the transmitter at the far end of the ﬁber. When 
1102.book  Page 147  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

148
Chapter 3: Networking Media
struck by a pulse of light at the proper wavelength, the PIN photodiode quickly produces 
an electric current of the proper voltage for the network. It instantly stops producing the 
voltage when no light strikes the PIN photodiode. This process generates the voltage 
changes that represent the data 1s and 0s on a copper cable.
Connectors
Connectors are attached to the ﬁber ends so that the ﬁbers can be connected to the ports 
on the transmitter and receiver. The most common type of connector used with multi-
mode ﬁber is the subscriber connector (SC ), as shown in Figure 3-29. On single-mode 
ﬁber, the straight tip (ST) connector, as shown in Figure 3-30, is frequently used. With 
SC and ST, there is one connector for each ﬁber. Newer connectors combine the send 
and receive ﬁbers into one modular connector, comparable in size to an RJ-45, to save 
space.
Figure 3-29 SC Connector
Figure 3-30 ST Connector
Optical Ampliﬁers and Fiber Patch Panels
In addition to the transmitters, receivers, connectors, and ﬁbers that are always required 
on an optical network, you can sometimes see several other devices on an optical ﬁber 
network.
Repeaters are optical ampliﬁers that receive attenuating light pulses traveling long 
distances and restore them to their original shapes, strengths, and timings. Then the 
restored signals can be sent on along the journey to the receiver at the far end of 
the ﬁber.

Fiber-optic patch panels, as shown in Figure 3-31, are similar to the patch panels used 
with copper cable. These panels increase the ﬂexibility of an optical network by allow-
ing quick changes to the connection of devices like switches or routers with various 
available ﬁber runs (cable links).
Figure 3-31 Fiber-Optic Patch Panels
Signals and Noise in Optical Fiber
Fiber-optic cable is not affected by the sources of external noise that cause problems 
on copper media. Why? Because external light cannot enter the ﬁber except at the 
transmitter end. The cladding is covered by a buffer and an outer jacket that stops 
light from entering or leaving the cable.
Furthermore, the transmission of light on one ﬁber in a cable does not generate inter-
ference that disturbs transmission on any other ﬁber, which means that ﬁber does not 
have the problem with crosstalk that copper media does. In fact, the quality of ﬁber-optic 
links is so good that the recent standards for Gigabit and 10-Gigabit Ethernet specify 
transmission distances that far exceed the traditional 2-kilometer reach of the original 
Ethernet. (You learn more about the Ethernet technologies in Chapter 6, “Ethernet 
Technologies and Ethernet Switching”.) Fiber-optic transmission allows the Ethernet 
protocol to be used on metropolitan-area networks (MANs) and WANs.
Although ﬁber is the best of all the transmission media at carrying large amounts of 
data over long distances, ﬁber is not without problems. When light travels through 
ﬁber, some of the light energy is lost. The farther a light signal travels through a ﬁber, 
1102.book  Page 149  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

150
Chapter 3: Networking Media
the more it loses strength. This attenuation of the signal is due to several factors 
involving the nature of ﬁber itself. The most important factor is scattering. The scat-
tering of light in a ﬁber is caused by microscopic non-uniformity (distortions) in the 
ﬁber that reﬂects and scatters some of the light energy, as shown in Figure 3-32.
Figure 3-32 Scattering
Absorption is another cause of light energy loss. When a light ray strikes some types of 
chemical impurities in a ﬁber, the impurities absorb part of the ray’s energy. This light 
energy is converted to a small amount of heat energy. Absorption makes the light signal 
a little dimmer.
Another factor that causes attenuation of the light signal is manufacturing irregularities 
or roughness in the core-to-cladding boundary. Power is lost from the light signal as a 
result of the less than perfect total internal reﬂection in that rough area of the ﬁber. If 
there are any microscopic imperfections in the thickness or symmetry of the ﬁber, it 
cuts down on total internal reﬂection, and some light energy is absorbed by the cladding.
Dispersion of a light ﬂash limits transmission distances on a ﬁber. Dispersion is the 
technical term for the spreading of pulses of light as they travel down the ﬁber, as 
shown in Figure 3-33.
Figure 3-33 Dispersion
Graded index multimode ﬁber is designed to compensate for the different distances the 
various modes of light have to travel in the large diameter core. Single-mode ﬁber does 
not have the problem of multiple paths that the light signal can follow. Chromatic

dispersion, however, is a characteristic of both multimode and single-mode ﬁber. Some 
wavelengths of light travel at slightly different speeds through glass than do other wave-
lengths. This discrepancy causes chromatic dispersion. That is why a prism separates 
the wavelengths of light. Ideally, an LED or laser light source emits light of just one 
frequency. Then, chromatic dispersion is not a problem.
Unfortunately, lasers and, especially, LEDs generate a range of wavelengths so chromatic 
dispersion limits the distance you can transmit on a ﬁber. If you try to transmit a signal 
too far, what started as a bright pulse of light energy is spread out, separated, and dim 
when it reaches the receiver. The receiver is not able to distinguish a 1 from a 0.
Installation, Care, and Testing of Optical Fiber
A major cause of too much attenuation in ﬁber-optic cable is improper installation. If 
the ﬁber is stretched or curved too tightly, it can cause tiny ﬁssures (cracks) in the core 
that scatter the light rays. Bending the ﬁber in too tight a curve can change the incident 
angle of light rays striking the core-to-cladding boundary. Then, the ray’s incident angle 
becomes less than the critical angle for total internal reﬂection. Instead of reﬂecting 
around the bend, some light rays refract into the cladding and are lost.
There are two types of bending:
■Macrobending—A macrobend is a bend you can see. When you bend ﬁber, you 
can cause some of the light rays to exceed the critical angle, allowing light to leak 
out of the core and into the cladding. When light is in the cladding, it cannot easily 
get back into the core; it then leaks out through the buffer, as shown in Figure 3-34.
■Microbending—Microbending produces the same effect as macrobending; it 
causes the light to exceed the critical angle and leak out of the core, as shown in 
Figure 3-34. It occurs on a microscopic scale and is not visible to the eye.
Figure 3-34 Macrobending and Microbending
 
 	
NOTE
Microbending can 
also be caused by 
extreme temperature 
swings in installed 
cable when the differ-
ent materials in the 
cable structure expand 
and contract at 
different rates. This 
expansion and con-
traction causes the 
ﬁber to be squeezed 
or stretched, which 
causes microbending.
1102.book  Page 151  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Chapter 3: Networking Media
To prevent ﬁber bends that are too sharp, ﬁber is usually pulled through a type of 
installed pipe called interducting. The interducting is much stiffer than ﬁber and can-
not be bent so sharply that the ﬁber inside the interducting has too tight a curve. The 
interducting protects the ﬁber, makes it easier to pull the ﬁber, and ensures that the 
bending radius (curve limit) of the ﬁber is not exceeded.
When the ﬁber has been pulled, the ends of the ﬁber must be cleaved (cut) and prop-
erly polished to ensure that the ends are smooth. Figure 3-35 illustrates the problems 
with improper ﬁber end face ﬁnishes, and Figure 3-36 illustrates the proper ﬁber end 
face polishing techniques.

A microscope or test instrument with a built-in magniﬁer is used to examine the end of 
the ﬁber and verify that it is properly polished and shaped. Then, the connector is care-
fully attached to the ﬁber end. Improperly installed connectors, improper splices, or 
the splicing of two cables with different core sizes dramatically reduces the strength of 
a light signal. Figure 3-37 illustrates the splicing of a 62.5 micron ﬁber to a 50 micron 
ﬁber.
Figure 3-37 Splicing of Different Types of Fiber
After the ﬁber-optic cable and connectors are installed, the connectors and the ends of 
the ﬁbers must be kept spotlessly clean. The ends of the ﬁbers should be covered with 
protective covers to prevent damage to the ﬁber ends. When these covers are removed 
prior to connecting the ﬁber to a port on a switch or router, the ﬁber ends must be 
cleaned. Clean the ﬁber ends with lint-free lens tissue moistened with pure isopropyl 
alcohol. The ﬁber ports on a switch or router should also be kept covered when not in 
use and cleaned with lens tissue and isopropyl alcohol before a connection is made. 
Dirty ends on a ﬁber cause a big drop in the amount of light that reaches the receiver.
All these factors, scattering, absorption, dispersion, improper installation, and dirty 
ﬁber ends diminish the strength of the light signal and are referred to as ﬁber noise. 
Before using a ﬁber-optic cable, it must be tested to ensure that enough light actually 
reaches the receiver for it to detect the 0s (off) and 1s (on) in the signal.
When a ﬁber-optic link is being planned, the amount of signal power loss that can be 
tolerated must be calculated. This tolerance is referred to as the optical link loss bud-
get. It is like your monthly ﬁnancial budget. After all your expenses (attenuations) are 
subtracted from your initial income, enough money must be left to get you through the 
month.
The decibel (dB) is the unit used to measure the amount of power loss. It tells what 
percent of the power that leaves the transmitter actually enters the receiver.
Testing ﬁber links is extremely important, and records of the results of these tests must 
be kept. Several types of ﬁber-optic test equipment are used. Two of the most important 
instruments are Optical Loss Meters and Optical Time Domain Reﬂectometers (OTDRs).

These meters both test optical cable to ensure that the cable meets the TIA standards 
for ﬁber. They also test to verify that the link power loss does not fall below the optical 
link loss budget. OTDRs can provide a lot of detailed diagnostic information about a 
ﬁber link and can be used to troubleshoot a link when problems occur.
Wireless Communications
Wireless signals are electromagnetic waves that can travel through the vacuum of outer 
space or through a medium such as air. No physical copper-based or ﬁber-optic medium 
is necessary for wireless signals, which makes utilizing wireless signals a very versatile 
way to build a network. Wireless transmissions can cover large distances by using 
high-frequency signals. Each signal uses a different frequency measured in hertz so that 
they remain unique from one another.
Wireless technologies have been around for many years. Satellite TV, AM/FM radio, 
cellular phones, remote-control devices, radar, alarm systems, weather radios, cordless 
phones, and retail scanners are integrated into everyday life. Today, wireless technolo-
gies are a fundamental part of business and personal life.
Wireless Data Communications
The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit voice, 
video, and data. It uses frequencies from 3 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). 
This section considers only the part of the radio spectrum that supports wireless data 
transmission.
Many different types of wireless data communications exist, as illustrated in Figure 3-38.

Each type of wireless data communication has its advantages and drawbacks, as 
follows:
■Infrared (IR)—Very high data rates and lower cost, but very short distance.
■Narrowband—Low data rates and medium cost. Requires a license and covers 
a limited distance.
■Spread spectrum—Medium cost and high data rates. Limited to campus coverage. 
Cisco Aironet products are spread spectrum.
■Broadband personal communications service (PCS)—Low data rates, medium 
cost, and citywide coverage. Sprint is an exception; Sprint PCS provides nation-
wide and international coverage.
■Circuit and packet data (cellular data and Cellular Digital Packet Data 
[CDPD])—Low data rates, high packet fees, and national coverage.
■Satellite—Low data rates, high cost, and nationwide or worldwide coverage.
Wireless Signal
When a signal is transmitted in a data format, you must consider the following three 
parameters:
■How fast—What data rate can be achieved?
■How far—How far can wireless LAN (WLAN) units be placed apart and still get 
the maximum data rate?
■How many—How many users can exist without slowing the data rate?

Chapter 3: Networking Media
These parameters all relate to the ability to receive a good signal as far away as possible. 
Increasing the amount of data requires the use of more frequency spectra or a different 
method of placing the data on the radio frequency (RF) signal.
RF efﬁciency is affected by the following three factors, as shown in Figure 3-39:
■Type of modulation used—More complex modulation techniques provide 
greater throughput.
■Distance—The farther the signal must be transmitted, the weaker the signal 
becomes.
■Noise—Electronic noise and barriers negatively affect RF.
Figure 3-39 Factors Affecting RF Efﬁciency
The following sections discuss these three factors in greater detail.
Modulation
Modulation is the process by which the amplitude, frequency, or phase of an RF or 
light wave is altered to transmit data. The characteristics of the carrier wave instanta-
neously are varied by another modulating waveform. Modulation blends a data signal 
(text, voice, and so on) into a carrier for transmission over a network.
The most common methods of modulation are as follows (see Figure 3-40):
■Amplitude modulation (AM)—Modulates the height of the carrier wave
■Frequency modulation (FM)—Modulates the frequency of the wave
■Phase modulation (PM)—Modulates the polarity (phase) of the wave

Figure 3-40 Modulation
Effects of Distance on a Signal
As a receiver moves farther from a transmitter, the signal gets weaker, and the differ-
ence between the signal and noise becomes less. Eventually, the signal cannot be distin-
guished from the noise, and loss of communication occurs. The amount of compression 
(or modulation scheme) at which the signal is transmitted determines the amount of 
signal needed to be heard through the noise. As transmission, or modulation schemes 
(compression), becomes more complex and data rates increase, immunity to noise less-
ens. Therefore, the distance is reduced.
Effects of Noise on a Signal
Electronic noise and barriers negatively affect RF efﬁciency. An exact transmission dis-
tance for WLAN products cannot be provided without going to the site and actually 
testing the environment. Walls with internal metal structures, for example, greatly 
limit RF transmission range.
Radio Frequency Bands
Most radio frequencies are licensed by government agencies, such as the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) in the United States. To broadcast over these frequencies, 
you need to have a license and to pay a fee.
Unlicensed frequency bands are easier to implement and cost less over time because 
they do not require licenses. Three unlicensed bands exist, as illustrated in Figure 3-41:
■900 megahertz (MHz)—The 900-MHz band carries cordless and cellular phones.
■2.4 gigahertz (GHz)—The 802.11b standard, the most widely deployed wireless 
standard, operates in the 2.4-GHz unlicensed radio band, delivering a maximum 
data rate of 11 Mbps.

NOTE
To be received cor-
rectly, complex modu-
lation schemes require 
optimal signal-to-noise 
ratios (more signal 
with less noise). If 
there is noise on the 
channel, the line speed 
is reduced. Noise, 
speed, and distance 
are all interrelated.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
■5 GHz—Recently, the FCC opened up the 5-GHz band for unlicensed use by 
high-speed data communications devices. Cisco has acquired 5-GHz technology 
and uses this frequency in new products, such as Cisco Aironet 1200 series, which 
is dual band, delivering support for both 2.4 GHz (802.11b) and 5 GHz (802.11a) 
standards. The 802.11a standard can deliver a maximum data rate of 54 Mbps.
Figure 3-41 Unlicensed Frequency Bands
A relationship exists between the frequency and the amount of data that can be sent. 
The concept is like that of a pipe. The wider the bandwidth is, the more frequencies 
are available. The wider the spectrum is, the higher the data rate can be transmitted. 
The amount of spectrum available determines the data rate.
Because the 900-MHz band supports cellular phones and other consumer products, 
the band has become overcrowded. As a result, users often experience interference or 
cannot access the network. As a beneﬁt, 900 MHz offers longer range (for the same 
gain antennas) than 2.4 GHz. The drawback of 900 MHz is that the fastest, most reli-
able data rate is only 1 Mbps because of its limited frequency range.
The 2.4-GHz frequency range is much wider than 900 MHz, allowing higher data 
rates with a reliable range of up to 25 miles. The Cisco Aironet 340 Wireless LAN 
Series can deliver 11-Mbps throughput because it operates in the 2.4-GHz frequency.
Cisco has acquired 5-GHz technology and will deliver products for the 5-GHz frequency 
range because its wider bandwidth allows for faster throughput of data. The Cisco 
Aironet 5 GHz 54 Mbps Wireless LAN client adapter is an IEEE 802.11a-compliant 
CardBus adapter that operates in the UNII-1 and UNII-2 bands. The client adapter

complements the Cisco Aironet 1200 Series 802.11a Access Point, providing a solution 
that combines performance and mobility with the security and manageability that 
enterprises require. It will be possible to achieve data rates of greater than 20 Mbps 
in this frequency range. The drawback of the 5-GHz frequency, however, is its limited 
range. The typical range for 5 GHz inside is about 50 feet; outside poses a limitation of 
approximately 2500 feet.
Spread-Spectrum Technology
Just as the radio in your car has AM and FM bands, other radios use certain bands, 
frequencies, and types of modulation. Spread spectrum (SS) is a modulation technique 
developed in the 1940s that spreads a transmission signal over a broad band of radio 
frequencies. The term spread spectrum describes a modulation technique that sacriﬁces 
bandwidth to gain signal-to-noise performance. This technique is ideal for data com-
munications because it is less susceptible to radio noise and creates little interference.
Spread spectrum, as illustrated in Figure 3-42, is a system in which the transmitted sig-
nal is spread over a frequency much wider than the minimum bandwidth required to 
send the signal. The fundamental premise is that in channels with narrowband inter-
ference increasing the transmitted signal bandwidth results in an increased probability 
that the received information is correct.
Figure 3-42 Spread-Spectrum Technology
To use the unlicensed radio bands, you have to use spread-spectrum techniques. Fre-
quency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
are two ways of doing spread spectrum. These spread-spectrum techniques spread the 
RF energy over the available band. The next sections describe FHSS and DSSS in more 
detail.
FHSS Versus DSSS
As modulation techniques, both frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and 
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) have advantages and limitations.
NOTE
Narrowband interfer-
ence occurs when two 
signals are broadcast-
ing at the same fre-
quency in the same 
geographic area. The 
term band refers to 
a grouping of fre-
quencies; narrow-
band would mean a 
relatively smaller 
range of frequencies. 
Narrowband noise 
might disrupt certain 
channels or spread-
spectrum components.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
With FHSS technology, transmissions hop from one frequency to another in random pat-
terns. Figure 3-43 illustrates an example of a FHSS. In this example, the transmission 
hops from C (2.42 GHz), to A (2.40 GHz), to D (2.43 GHz), then to B (2.41 GHz), and 
ﬁnally to E (2.44 GHz). This technique enables the transmissions to hop around narrow-
band interference, resulting in a clearer signal and higher reliability of the transmission. 
However, FHSS technology is slower, and the receiver must use the same pattern to decode.
Figure 3-43 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
DSSS technology transmissions, as illustrated in Figure 3-44, are more reliable because 
each bit (1 or 0) is represented by a string of 1s and 0s called a chipping sequence. Even 
if up to 40 percent of the string is lost, the original transmission can be reconstructed. 
DSSS technology also enables high throughput of data and longer-range access.

Limited to a 2-Mbps data-transfer rate, FHSS is recommended for only very speciﬁc 
applications such as for certain types of watercraft. For all other wireless LAN applica-
tions, DSSS is the better choice. The recently released evolution of the IEEE standard, 
802.11b, provides for a full Ethernet-like data rate of 11 Mbps over DSSS. FHSS does 
not support data rates greater than 2 Mbps.
Wireless Networking
When the computer was ﬁrst introduced to the world, it was affordable by only large 
corporations, governments, and universities. From the ﬁrst building-sized devices with 
minimal computing power to those that ﬁt in the palm of a person’s hand, huge leaps 
in technology have occurred. The same is true on the connectivity side of the industry.
The various types of networking discussed earlier in this chapter have all involved 
physical connectivity. The advantages are speed, reliability, and to a certain extent con-
venience. Physical connectivity allows an increase in productivity by allowing the shar-
ing of printers, servers, and software. However, networked systems require that the 
workstation remain stationary, permitting moves only within the limits of the media 
and ofﬁce area.
The introduction of wireless technology removes these restraints and brings true port-
ability to the computing world. While the current state of wireless technology does not 
provide the high-speed transfers of cabled networks nor the security and uptime reli-
ability, the ﬂexibility justiﬁes the trade off.
When considering the installation of a network in an existing facility, wireless is at the 
top of many an administrator’s lists of options. A simple wireless network can be up 
and running in just a few minutes after the workstations are turned on. Connectivity 
to the Internet is provided through a wired connection, router, cable modem, or Digital 
Subscriber Line (DSL) modem, and a wireless access point that acts as a hub for the 
wireless nodes. In a residential or small ofﬁce environment these devices might be com-
bined into a single unit.
Wireless LAN Organization and Standards
An understanding of the regulations and standards that apply to wireless technology 
ensures that deployed networks are interoperable and in compliance. Just as in cabled 
networks, IEEE is the prime issuer of standards for wireless networks. The standards 
have been created within the framework of the regulations set forth by the FCC.
A key technology contained within the IEEE 802.11 standard is DSSS. DSSS applies to 
wireless devices operating within a 1 to 2 Mbps range. A DSSS system can operate at 
1102.book  Page 161  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

162
Chapter 3: Networking Media
up to 11 Mbps but is not considered compliant above 2 Mbps. The next standard 
approved was IEEE 802.11b, which increased transmission capabilities to 11 Mbps. 
Even though DSSS WLANs are able to interoperate with the FHSS WLANs, problems 
developed prompting design changes by the manufacturers. In this case, IEEE’s task 
was simply to create a standard that matched the manufacturer’s solution.
IEEE 802.11b, called Wi-Fi or high-speed wireless, refers to DSSS systems that operate 
at 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps. All 802.11b systems are backward-compliant in that they 
also support 802.11 for 1- and 2-Mbps data rates for DSSS only. This backward com-
patibility is extremely important because it allows upgrading of the wireless network 
without replacing the network interface cards (NICs) or access points.
IEEE 802.11b devices achieve the higher data throughput rate by using a different cod-
ing technique from 802.11, allowing for a greater amount of data to be transferred in 
the same time frame. The majority of 802.11b devices still fail to match the 10 Mbps 
throughput of wired Ethernet and generally function in the 2–4 Mbps range.
802.11a covers WLAN devices operating in the 5-GHz transmission band. Using the 
5-GHz range disallows interoperability of 802.11b devices as they operate within 
2.4 GHz. 802.11a is capable of supplying data throughput of 54 Mpbs and with pro-
prietary technology known as rate doubling has achieved 108 Mbps. In production 
networks a more standard rating is 20 to 26 Mbps.
802.11g provides the same throughout as 802.11a but with backwards compatibility 
for 802.11g devices using Othogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) mod-
ulation technology. Cisco has developed an access point that permits 802.11b and 
802.11a devices to coexist on the same WLAN. The access point supplies gateway 
services allowing these otherwise incompatible devices to communicate.
Wireless Devices and Topologies
A wireless network can consist of as few as two devices, two nodes with wireless NICs. 
Figure 3-45 shows an internal wireless NIC, and Figure 3-46 shows an external USB 
wireless NIC. The nodes can be desktop workstations or notebook computers. Equipped 
with wireless NICs, an ad hoc network can be established that equates to a peer-to-
peer wired network. Both devices act as servers and clients in this environment, and 
although it does provide connectivity, security is at a minimum along with throughput. 
Another problem with this type of network is compatibility; oftentimes, NICs from 
different manufacturers do not interoperate.

Chapter 3: Networking Media
More commonly, an access point (AP), as shown in Figure 3-47, is installed acting as 
a central hub for the WLAN infrastructure mode. The AP is hard wired to the cabled 
LAN to provide Internet access and connectivity to the wired network. APs are equipped 
with antennae and provide wireless connectivity over a speciﬁed area referred to as a cell.
Figure 3-47 Access Point
Depending on the structural composition of the location in which the AP is installed 
and the size and gain of the antennae, the size of the cell can range from a few dozen 
feet to 25 miles. More commonly the range is from 300 to 500 feet. To service larger 
areas multiple APs can be installed with a degree of overlap, permitting roaming
between cells, as illustrated in Figure 3-48. This roaming is very similar to the services 
provided by cellular phone companies. Overlap on multiple AP networks is critical to 
allow for movement of devices within the WLAN, and although it is not addressed in 
the IEEE standards, a 20–30 percent overlap is desirable. This rate of overlap permits 
roaming between cells, allowing for the disconnect/reconnect activity to occur seam-
lessly without service interruption.
When a client is activated within the WLAN, it starts listening for a compatible device 
with which to associate. This process is referred to as scanning and can be active or 
passive.
Active scanning causes a probe request to be sent from the wireless node seeking to 
join the network. The probe request contains the Service Set Identiﬁer (SSID) of the 
network it wants to join. When an AP with the same SSID is found, the AP issues a 
probe response, and the authentication and association steps are completed.
1102.book  Page 164  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Wireless Networking
165
Figure 3-48 Roaming
Passive scanning nodes listen for beacon management frames (beacons), which are 
transmitted by the AP (infrastructure mode) or peer nodes (ad hoc). When a node 
receives a beacon that contains the SSID of the network it is trying to join, an attempt 
is made to join the network. Passive scanning is a continuous process and nodes can 
associate or disassociate with APs as signal strength changes.
How Wireless LANs Communicate
After establishing connectivity to the WLAN, a node passes frames similarly to any 
other 802 network. WLANs do not use a standard 802.3 frame. Therefore, using the 
term wireless Ethernet is misleading. There are three types of frames: control, manage-
ment, and data. The following lists the frames that are included in each type of frame:
■Management frames
— Association request frame
— Association response frame
— Probe request frame
— Probe response frame
— Beacon frame
— Authentication frame

166
Chapter 3: Networking Media
■Control frames
— Request to send (RTS)
— Clear to send (CTS)
— Acknowledgment
■Data frames
Only the data frame type is similar to 802.3 frames. However, the payload of wireless 
and 802.3 frames is 1500 bytes, and an Ethernet frame cannot exceed 1518 bytes. On 
the other hand, a wireless frame can be as large as 2346 bytes. Usually the WLAN frame 
size is limited to 1518 bytes because it is most commonly connected to a wired Ether-
net network.
Because RF is a shared medium, collisions can occur just as they do on wired shared 
medium. The signiﬁcant difference is that there is no method by which the source node 
is able to detect that a collision has occurred. In view of this, WLANs use carrier sense 
multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). This feature is somewhat like 
Ethernet carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD). Chapter 5, “Ether-
net Fundamentals,” discusses CSMA/CD in greater detail.
When a source node sends a frame, the receiving node returns a positive acknowledg-
ment (ACK); which can consequently cause consumption of 50 percent of the available 
bandwidth. This overhead, when combined with the collision avoidance protocol 
overhead, reduces the actual data throughput to a maximum of 5.0 to 5.5 Mbps on 
an IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN rated at 11 Mbps.
Performance of the network will also be affected by signal strength and degradation in 
signal quality due to distance or interference. As the signal becomes weaker, Adaptive 
Rate Selection (ARS) can be invoked, and the transmitting unit drops the data rate from 
11 Mbps to 5.5 Mbps, from 5.5 Mbps to 2 Mbps, or 2 Mbps to 1 Mbps, as illustrated 
in Figure 3-49.
Authentication and Association
WLAN authentication occurs at Layer 2 and is the process of authenticating the device, 
not the user. This point is a critical one to remember when considering WLAN secu-
rity, troubleshooting, and overall management.
Authentication might be a null process, as in the case of a new AP and NIC with default 
conﬁgurations in place. The client sends an authentication request frame to the AP, 
and the frame is accepted or rejected by the AP. The client is notiﬁed of either course of 
action via an authentication response frame. The AP might also be conﬁgured to hand 
off the authentication task to an authentication server, which performs a more thorough 
credentialing process.

Wireless Networking
167
Figure 3-49 Adaptive Rate Selection
Association, performed after authentication, is the state that permits a client to use the 
AP’s services to transfer data.
Authentication and Association Types
The authentication and association types are as follows:
■Unauthenticated and unassociated—The node is disconnected from the network 
and not associated to an access point.
■Authenticated and unassociated—The node has been authenticated on the net-
work but has not yet associated with the access point.
■Authenticated and associated—The node is connected to the network and able 
to transmit and receive data through the access point.
Methods of Authentication
IEEE 802.11 lists two types of authentication processes:
■Open system—This process is an open connectivity standard in which only the 
SSID must match. It can be used in a secure or non-secure environment, although 
the ability of low-level network sniffers to ascertain the SSID of the WLAN is 
fairly high.

■Shared key—This process requires the use of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
encryption. WEP is a fairly simple algorithm using 64- and 128-bit keys. The AP 
is conﬁgured with an encrypted key, and nodes attempting to access the network 
through the AP must have a matching key. Statically assigned WEP keys provide 
a higher level of security than the open system but are deﬁnitely not hack proof.
The susceptibility to unauthorized entry into WLANs is being addressed by a number 
of emerging security solution technologies.
The Radio Wave/Microwave Spectrum
Computers send data signals electronically. Radio transmitters convert these electrical 
signals to radio waves. The radio waves are generated by changing electric currents in 
a transmitter’s antenna. These radio waves radiate out in straight lines from the antenna. 
However, radio waves weaken (attenuate) as they move out from the transmitting 
antenna. In a WLAN, a radio signal measured at a distance of just 10 meters (30 feet) 
from the transmitting antenna is only 1/100th of its original strength. Like light, radio 
waves can be absorbed by some materials and reﬂected by others. When passing from 
one material like air into another material like a plaster wall, radio waves are refracted 
(bent). Radio waves are also scattered and absorbed by water droplets in the air.
These qualities of radio waves are important to remember when a WLAN is being 
planned for a building or for a campus. The process of evaluating a location for the 
installation of a WLAN is called making a site survey.
Because radio signals weaken as they travel away from the transmitter, the receiver 
must also be equipped with an antenna. When radio waves hit a receiver’s antenna, 
weak electric currents are generated in that antenna. These electric currents, caused by 
the received radio waves, are equal to the currents that originally generated the radio 
waves in the transmitter’s antenna. The receiver ampliﬁes the strength of these weak 
electrical signals.
In a transmitter, the electrical (data) signals from a computer or a LAN are not sent 
directly into the transmitter’s antenna. Rather these data signals are used to alter a 
second, strong signal called the carrier signal.
A receiver demodulates the carrier signal that arrives from its antenna. The receiver 
interprets the phase changes of the carrier signal and reconstructs from it the original 
electrical data signal.

Signals and Noise on a WLAN
On a wired Ethernet network, it is usually a fairly simple process to diagnose the cause 
of interference. When using RF technology, you must take into account many kinds of 
interference:
■Narrowband—This is the opposite of spread spectrum technology. As the name 
implies, narrowband does not affect the entire frequency spectrum of the wireless 
signal. One solution to a narrowband interference problem is simply changing 
the channel that the AP is using. Actually, diagnosing the cause of narrowband 
interference can be a costly and time-consuming experience. To identify the source 
requires a spectrum analyzer and even a low cost model can cost $3000 to $4000 
in the U.S. Examples of narrowband interference include CB radios and ham 
radios.
■All band—All band interference affects the entire spectrum range. Bluetooth 
technologies hop across the entire 2.4 GHz many times per second and can cause 
signiﬁcant interference on an 802.11b network. It is not uncommon to see signs 
in facilities that use wireless networks requesting that all Bluetooth devices be 
shut down before entering. In homes and ofﬁces, a device that is often overlooked 
as causing interference is the standard microwave oven. Leakage from a micro-
wave of as little as 1 watt into the RF spectrum can cause major network disrup-
tion. Wireless phones operating in the 2.4-GHz spectrum can also cause network 
degradation.
■Weather—Generally, the RF signal is not affected by even the most extreme 
weather conditions. However, fog or very high moisture conditions can and do 
affect wireless networks. Lightning can also charge the atmosphere and alter the 
path of a transmitted signal.
Signal Range Concerns
The ﬁrst and most obvious source of a signal problem is the transmitting station and 
antenna type. A higher output station transmits the signal further, and a parabolic dish 
antenna that concentrates the signal increases the transmission range.
In a small ofﬁce, home ofﬁce (SOHO) environment, most access points utilize twin 
omnidirectional antennae that transmit the signal in all directions, thereby reducing 
the range of communication. Figure 3-50 illustrates an omnidirectional antenna.

Wireless Security
The exponential growth of networking, including wireless technologies, has led to 
increased security risks. Increasing the security means increasing the time spent manag-
ing the system.
The ﬁrst level of security in a wireless LAN consists of protecting the radio frequency 
waveform itself. Wireless access points radiate radio waves over a large area that is 
not contained in a physical building, which makes the radio waves accessible to eaves-
droppers and thus increases vulnerability. The radio waves of wireless bridges are con-
centrated in a beam. An eavesdropper must get into the beam path to intercept the 
communication. Therefore, wireless access points usually require better security than 
wireless bridges.
WEP
Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is a security mechanism, deﬁned within the 802.11 
standard, that is designed to protect the over-the-air transmission between wireless 
LAN access points and NICs. The IEEE 802.11b requires 40-bit encryption keys. 
However, many vendors, such as Cisco, support the optional 128-bit standard.
The main goals with WEP follow:
■Deny access to the network by unauthorized users who do not possess the appro-
priate WEP key
■Prevent the decoding of captured WLAN trafﬁc that is WEP-encrypted without 
the possession of the WEP key

WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher that was invented by Ron Rivest of RSA Data Secu-
rity, Inc., (RSADSI) for encryption. The RC4 encryption algorithm is a symmetric-stream 
cipher that supports a variable-length key. A symmetric cipher uses the same key for 
both encryption and decryption. The key is the one piece of information that must be 
shared by both the encrypting and decrypting endpoints.
Recently, encryption analysts have reported weaknesses in the authentication and WEP 
encryption schemes in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard. Improvements on WEP have 
been developed to address the weaknesses found by encryption analysts. However, it is 
not recommended to use WEP as a sole security mechanism for a WLAN. WEP should 
be supplemented with additional higher-level security mechanisms, such as a VPN or 
ﬁrewalls.
VPN, EAP, and LEAP
A number of new security solutions and protocols, such as Virtual Private Network 
(VPN) and Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) are evolving. Using EAP, the 
access point does not provide authentication to the client but passes the duties to a 
more sophisticated server designed for that purpose. Using an integrated VPN server, 
VPN technology creates a tunnel on top of an existing protocol such as IP. This tunnel 
is a Layer 3 connection as opposed to the Layer 2 connection between the AP and the 
sending node.
The following list brieﬂy describes EAP and LEAP:
■EAP-MD5 Challenge—EAP is the earliest authentication type, which is very similar 
to Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) password protection 
on a wired network. EAP allows wireless client adapters that can support differ-
ent authentication types to communicate with different back end servers, such as 
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).
■Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)—Cisco has developed 
a derivation of EAP based on mutual authentication called LEAP. Mutual authenti-
cation means that both the user and the access point to which the user is attempt-
ing to connect must be authenticated before access onto the corporate network is 
allowed. Mutual authentication protects enterprises from unauthorized APs serving 
as a potential entrance into the network. LEAP is the type of authentication pri-
marily used on Cisco WLAN access points. LEAP provides security during credential 
exchange, encrypts using dynamic WEP keys, and supports mutual authentication.
VPN security levels include the following:
■User authentication—Allows only authorized users to connect, send, and receive 
data over the wireless network.
1102.book  Page 171  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

172
Chapter 3: Networking Media
■Encryption—Provides encryption services, further protecting the data from 
intruders.
■Data authentication—Ensures the integrity of the data, authenticating source, 
and destination devices.
VPN technology effectively closes the wireless network because an unrestricted WLAN 
automatically forwards trafﬁc between nodes that appear to be on the same wireless 
network. WLANS often extend outside the perimeter of the home or ofﬁce in which 
they are installed, and without security, intruders can inﬁltrate the network with little 
effort. Conversely, it takes minimal effort on the part of the network administrator to 
provide low-level security to the WLAN.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■Electricity is based on the ability of electrons of certain types of atoms to separate, 
or ﬂow, from the conﬁnes of their atoms.
■Opposite charges attract and like charges repel. Electricity ﬂows from negative to 
positive within electrical circuits.
■Materials can be classiﬁed as insulators, conductors, or semiconductors, depending 
on their ability to allow electrons to ﬂow.
■The concepts of voltage, current, resistance, and impedance provide a means of 
measuring electricity, which is required to be able to design and manufacture 
electronic devices.
■Alternating current and direct current are the two types of current. AC provides 
power to our homes, schools, and work places. DC is used with electrical devices 
that depend on a battery to function.
■STP cable combines the techniques of shielding, cancellation, and twisting of 
wires. ScTP cable is essentially a twisted pair wrapped in a metallic foil shield.
■UTP cable is a four-pair wire medium used in a variety of networks.
■Coaxial cable consists of four main parts: copper conductor, plastic insulation, 
braided copper shielding, and outer jacket.
■Speciﬁcations or standards are sets of rules or procedures that are widely used 
and serve as the accepted method of performing a task.
■Optical ﬁber is a good transmission medium when it is properly installed, tested, 
and maintained.

Summary
173
■Light energy, a type of electromagnetic energy wave, is used to transmit large 
amounts of data securely over relatively long distances.
■Light rays obey the laws of reﬂection and refraction as they travel through a glass 
ﬁber, which allows ﬁbers with the property of total internal reﬂection to be man-
ufactured. Total internal reﬂection makes light signals stay inside the ﬁber, even if 
the ﬁber is not straight.
■Attenuation of a light signal becomes a problem over long cables, especially if 
sections of cable are connected at patch panels or spliced. Therefore, cable and 
connectors must be properly installed and thoroughly tested with high-quality 
optical test equipment before their use.
■In wireless data communication, the radio spectrum is the part of the electromag-
netic spectrum used to transmit voice, video, and data.
■Modulation is the process by which the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a radio 
frequency or lightwave is changed to transmit data.
■To take advantage of unlicensed radio bands, you have to use spread-spectrum 
techniques. Two important modulation technologies are frequency-hopping 
spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). DSSS 
offers greater reliability and more throughput than FHSS.
■The wireless signal deteriorates with distance. A wireless device connects at a 
slower speed if it is moved out of optimal range.
■Noise can be caused through structures (walls with metal) or by electrical equip-
ment. Both adversely affect the range of wireless communications.
■Wireless standards include IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, and 
IEEE 802.11g.
■Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is a security mechanism, deﬁned within the 
802.11 standard, that is designed to protect the over-the-air transmission 
between wireless LAN APs and NICs.
■A number of new security solutions and protocols, such as VPN, EAP, and LEAP, 
are emerging.

Chapter 4
Cable Testing and Cabling LANs 
and WANs
This chapter describes issues relating to the testing of media used for physical layer con-
nectivity in local-area networks (LANs). In order for the LAN or WAN to function properly, 
the physical layer medium must meet the industry standards speciﬁed for the data rate 
used to transmit signals over Ethernet (10, 100, 1000, or 10,000 Mbps). The use of signals
in this text refers to the data signals that move from the transmitter to the receiver. The 
signals weaken (attenuate) traveling over the physical media; however, the receiver must 
still be able to clearly determine the state of each bit of the data (one or zero). Otherwise, 
the error rate on the network will be too high for the LAN or WAN connections to be 
useful.
Networking media is literally and physically the backbone of a network. Inferior quality 
network cabling results in network failures and in networks with unreliable performance. 
All three categories of networking media (copper-based, optical ﬁber, and wireless) require 
testing and measurement to determine their quality, and this testing is the primary subject 
of this chapter.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and PhotoZooms 
that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Background for Studying Frequency-Based 
Cable Testing
The equipment used to perform quality testing and measurement of copper-based, optical 
ﬁber, and wireless networking media involves certain electrical and mathematical concepts 
and terms, such as signal, wave, frequency, and noise. Understanding this vocabulary 
is helpful when learning about networking, cabling, and cable testing.
Waves
A wave is energy traveling from one place to another. Many types of waves exist, but 
all can be described with similar vocabulary.
It is helpful to think of waves as disturbances. A bucket of water that is completely 
still, with no disturbances, does not have waves. Conversely, the ocean always has 
some sort of detectable waves due to disturbances such as wind and tide.
Ocean waves can be described in terms of their height, or amplitude, which can be 
measured in meters. They can also be described in terms of how frequently the waves 
reach the shore. This feature can be described in two similar ways: period and frequency. 
The period of the waves is the amount of time between each wave and is measured in 
seconds. The frequency is the number of waves that reach the shore each second.
The amplitude of an electrical signal represents its height just as in ocean waves, but 
it is measured in volts instead of meters. If the signal repeats itself regularly, then the 
period of the signal is the amount of time to complete one cycle of the signal, and is 
measured in seconds, just as the period of ocean waves is the amount of time for one 
wave to complete. The frequency of an electrical signal is the number of complete 
cycles (or waves) per second and is measured in hertz.
If a disturbance is deliberately caused and involves a ﬁxed, predictable duration, it is 
called a pulse. Pulses are important in electrical signals because they determine the 
value of the data being transmitted.
Figure 4-1 shows a representation of the concepts of amplitude and frequency.
Networking professionals are interested in speciﬁc types of waves:
 
■Voltage waves on copper media
 
■Light waves in optical ﬁber
 
■Alternating electric and magnetic ﬁelds called electromagnetic waves used in 
the wireless environment

Sine Waves and Square Waves
Sine waves, or sinusoids, are graphs of mathematical functions as shown in Figure 4-2.

Sine waves have certain characteristics:
 
■They are periodic (which means that they repeat the same pattern at regular 
intervals).
 
■They are continuously varying (which means that no two adjacent points on 
the graph have the same value).

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Sine waves are graphical representations of many natural occurrences that change reg-
ularly over time, such as the distance from the earth to the sun, the distance from the 
ground while riding a Ferris wheel, and the time of day that the sun rises. Since sine 
waves are continuously varying, they are examples of analog waves.
Square waves, like sine waves, are periodic. However, square wave graphs do not con-
tinuously vary with time. The values remain the same for some time, then suddenly 
change, then remain the same, and then suddenly return to the initial value, as shown 
in Figure 4-3. Square waves represent digital signals, or pulses. Square waves, like all 
waves, can be described in terms of amplitude, period, and frequency.
Figure 4-3 Digital Signals
Exponents and Logarithms
As discussed in Chapter 1, “Introduction to Networking,” in networking, remember 
three important number systems:
 
■Base 2 (binary)
 
■Base 10 (decimal)
 
■Base 16 (hexadecimal)
Recall that the base of a number system refers to the number of different symbols that 
can occupy one place. For example, binary numbers have only two different place-
holders (the numbers 0 and 1), decimal numbers have 10 different place holders (the 
numbers 0–9), and hexadecimal numbers have 16 different placeholders (the numbers 
0–9 and the letters A through F).
Remember that 10 * 10 can be written as 102 (10 “squared,” or 10 raised to the second 
power, or 10 multiplied by itself 2 times. 10 * 10 * 10 can be written as 103 (ten “cubed,”

or 10 raised to the third power, or 10 multiplied by itself 3 times). When written this 
way, you say that 10 is the base of the number and 2 or 3 is the exponent of the num-
ber. The following example demonstrates the preceding concepts.
The base of a number system also refers to the value of each digit. The least signiﬁcant 
digit has a value of base0 (base raised to the zero power), or one. The next digit has a 
value of base1. This is equal to 2 for binary numbers, 10 for decimal numbers, and 16 
for hexadecimal numbers.
Numbers with exponents are used to more easily represent very large numbers. It is 
much easier and less error prone to represent one billion numerically as 109 than as 
1,000,000,000. Many calculations involved in cable testing involve numbers that are 
very large, so exponents are the preferred format.
Decibels
An important way of describing networking signals is a unit of measure called the 
decibel (dB). The decibel is related to the exponents and logarithms described in prior 
sections. The formulas for calculating decibels are as follows:
dB = 10 log10 (Pﬁnal / Pref)
or
dB = 20 log10 (Vﬁnal / Vreference)
Typically, light waves on optical ﬁber and radio waves in the air are measured using 
the power formula, and electromagnetic waves on copper cables are measured using the 
voltage formula. In these formulas,
 
■dB measures the loss or gain of the power of a wave. Decibels are usually negative 
numbers representing a loss in power as the wave travels, but can also be positive 
values representing a gain in power if the signal is ampliﬁed.
 
■log10 indicates that the number in parenthesis is transformed using the base 10 
logarithm rule.
 
■Pﬁnal is the delivered power measured in watts.
 
■Pref is the original power measured in watts.

■Vﬁnal is the delivered voltage measured in volts.
 
■Vref is the original voltage measured in volts.
The following example illustrates how the dB value is calculated:
Pﬁnal = Pref * 10(dB/10)
dB = 20
Pref = 2 kilowatts
Pﬁnal = 200 kilowatts
When you enter values for dB and Pref, the resulting power changes. This calculation 
can be used to see how much power is left in a radio wave after it has traveled over a 
distance, through different materials, and through various stages of electronic systems 
such as a radio.
Viewing Signals in Time and Frequency
One of the most important facts of the “information age” is that data symbolizing 
characters, words, pictures, video, or music can be represented electrically by voltage 
patterns on wires and in electronic devices. The data represented by these voltage patterns 
can be converted to light waves or radio waves and back to voltage waves. Consider 
the example of an analog telephone. The sound waves of the caller’s voice enter a 
microphone in the telephone. The microphone converts the patterns of sound energy 
into voltage patterns of electrical energy that represent the voice.
If the voltage patterns are graphed over time, the distinct patterns representing the 
voice are displayed. An oscilloscope is an important electronic device used to view 
electrical signals, such as voltage waves and pulses. The x-axis on the display repre-
sents time, and the y-axis represents voltage or current. There are usually two y-axis 
inputs, so two waves can be observed and measured at the same time.
Analyzing signals using an oscilloscope is called time-domain analysis because the 
x-axis or domain of the mathematical function represents time. Engineers also use 
frequency-domain analysis to study signals. In frequency-domain analysis, the x-axis 
represents frequency. An electronic device called a spectrum analyzer creates graphs 
for frequency-domain analysis. Figure 4-4 illustrates several signals of how the output 
looks on both the oscilloscope and the spectrum analyzer.

Noise in Time and Frequency
189
Figure 4-4 Fourier Synthesis
Electromagnetic signals use different frequencies for transmission so that different signals 
do not interfere with each other. For example, frequency modulation (FM) radio signals 
use frequencies that are different than television or satellite signals. When listeners change 
the station on a radio, they are changing the frequency that the radio is receiving.
Noise in Time and Frequency
An important concept in communications systems, including LANs, is noise, as shown in 
Figure 4-5. Although noise usually signiﬁes undesirable sounds, the deﬁnition of noise 
that is related to communications is undesirable signals. Noise can originate from natural 
and technological sources and is added to the data signals in communications systems.
All communications systems have noise. Even though noise cannot be completely elim-
inated, its effects can be minimized if the sources of the noise are understood. Sources 
of noise include the following:
 
■Nearby cables that carry data signals
 
■Radio frequency interference (RFI), which is noise from other signals being 
transmitted nearby
 
■Electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is noise from nearby sources such 
as motors and lights
 
■Laser noise at the transmitter or receiver of an optical signal

Figure 4-5 Recognizing and Deﬁning Noise
Noise that affects all transmission frequencies equally is called white noise. Noise that 
affects only small ranges of frequencies is called narrowband interference. When detected 
on a radio receiver, white noise interferes with all radio stations, while narrowband 
interference affects only a few stations whose frequencies are close together. When 
detected on a LAN, white noise affects all data transmissions, but narrowband inter-
ference might disrupt only certain signals. However, if the band of frequencies affected 
by the narrowband interference included all frequencies transmitted on the LAN, the 
performance of the entire LAN is compromised.
Analog and Digital Bandwidth
Bandwidth is an extremely important concept in communications systems. For your 
study of LANs, two ways of considering bandwidth are important: analog bandwidth 
and digital bandwidth.
Analog bandwidth typically refers to the frequency range of an analog electronic system. 
Analog bandwidth can be used to describe the range of frequencies transmitted by a 
radio station or an electronic ampliﬁer. The units of analog bandwidth are the units 
of frequency; cycles per second, or hertz. Examples of analog bandwidth values are 
3 kilohertz (kHz) for telephony, 20 kHz for audible signals, 5 kHz for AM radio stations, 
and 200 kHz for FM radio stations.

Signals and Noise on Networking Media
191
Digital bandwidth measures how much information can ﬂow from one place to another 
in a given amount of time. The fundamental unit of measurement for digital bandwidth 
is bits per second (bps). However, because LANs are capable of speeds of millions of 
bits per second, the unit is often expressed in kilobits per second (kbps) or megabits 
per second (Mbps), as shown in Table 4-1. Bandwidth is limited by physical media, 
current technologies, and the laws of physics.
During cable testing, analog bandwidth is used to determine the digital bandwidth of 
a copper cable. Analog frequencies are transmitted from one end and received on the 
opposite end. The two signals are then compared, and the amount of attenuation of 
the signal is calculated. In general, media that supports higher analog bandwidths 
without high degrees of attenuation will also support higher digital bandwidths.
Signals and Noise on Networking Media
Noise refers to any interference on the physical medium that makes it difﬁcult for 
the receiver to detect the data signal. Copper cabling is susceptible to many sources 
of noise, but far fewer sources of noise are possible when optical ﬁber is used as the 
transmission medium. Some level of noise on the medium is inevitable, but that accept-
able level of noise must be kept as low as possible. Just as it is difﬁcult to carry on a 
conversation when the background noise of the room is high compared to the volume 
of the participant’s voices, data signals can be overwhelmed by the strength of noise to 
the point that the desired signal cannot be interpreted.
Proper cable installation techniques and proper attachment of connectors at both ends 
of a cable are vital. If standards are followed, the data signal experiences less attenua-
tion, and noise levels are kept at a minimum.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Once the cable has been installed, it must be tested and meet the speciﬁcations of the 
Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronics Industries Association TIA/EIA-
568-B standards. Problems must be identiﬁed and corrected prior to further installa-
tion of network hardware. Installed cable should also be tested periodically after the 
installation to determine if it still meets speciﬁcations. Cable and connectors experience 
wear and deterioration over a period of time, and potential problems must be identi-
ﬁed and corrected to ensure reliable network operation. For all cable testing and trouble-
shooting, quality cable testers must be properly used.
Signaling over Copper and Fiber-Optic Cabling
On copper cable, the data signals are represented by voltage changes that depict binary 
ones and zeros. At the transmitter and receiver the voltage levels are measured with 
respect to the signal ground. The signal ground provides a reference level of zero volts. 
The transmitting and receiving device must be properly grounded so that this zero volt 
reference point is accurate.
For the LAN to operate properly, the receiving device must be able to accurately inter-
pret the binary ones and zeros transmitted as voltage levels. The signals use very low 
voltages; less than 5 volts. Because current Ethernet technology supports data rates of 
billions of bits per second, each bit must be recognized even though its duration is very 
small. The voltage level cannot be ampliﬁed at the receiver, nor the bit duration extended, 
to recognize the data. Therefore, as much of the original signal strength as possible must 
be retained as the signal moves through the cable and passes through the connectors. In 
anticipation of ever-faster Ethernet protocols, new cable installations should be made 
with the best available Category 5 (CAT 5) unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) or higher 
rated cable, connectors, and interconnect devices such as, punch-down blocks and 
patch panels.
Two basic types of copper cable exist, shielded and unshielded. In shielded cable, some 
types of shielding protect the data signal from external sources of noise. Other types of 
shielding protect one pair of wires in a cable from noise generated by electrical signals 
on another pair of wires within the same cable.
Coaxial cable is a type of shielded cable, as shown in Figure 4-6. It consists of a solid 
copper conductor surrounded, ﬁrst, by an insulating material and, then, by a braided 
conductive shielding. In LAN applications, the braided shielding is electrically grounded, 
protecting the inner conductor from external electrical noise. The shielding also helps 
eliminate signal loss by keeping the transmitted signal conﬁned to the cable, which helps 
make coaxial cable less “noisy” than twisted pair; however, coaxial cable is also more 
expensive. The need to ground the shielding and the bulky size of coaxial cable also 
make it more difﬁcult to install than other types of copper cabling.

Figure 4-6 Coaxial Cable
There are two types of twisted pair cable:
■Shielded twisted-pair (STP) (see Figure 4-7)
■Unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) (see Figure 4-8)
Figure 4-7 Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable
STP cable, which can also be referred to as screened twisted-pair (ScTP) or foil twisted 
pair (FTP), contains an outer conductive shield that is electrically grounded to insulate 
the signals from external electrical noise. STP also uses inner foil shields to protect each 
wire pair from noise generated by the other pairs. STP cable is more expensive, more 
difﬁcult to install, and less frequently used than UTP. UTP contains no shielding and is 
the noisiest copper cabling, but it is the most frequently used because it is inexpensive 
and easier to install.

Figure 4-8 Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable
Fiber-optic cable, shown in Figures 4-9 and 4-10, transmits data signals by increasing 
and decreasing the intensity of light to represent binary ones and zeros. The strength of 
a light signal does not diminish like the strength of an electrical signal does over an iden-
tical run length. Optical signals are not affected by electrical noise, and optical ﬁber does 
not need to be grounded. Therefore, optical ﬁber is often used between buildings and 
between ﬂoors within the building. As costs decrease and demand for speed increases, 
optical ﬁber may become a more commonly used LAN media.

Figure 4-10 Fiber-Optic Cable
Attenuation and Insertion Loss on Copper Media
Attenuation is the decrease in signal amplitude over the length of a link, as shown in 
Figure 4-11. Long cable lengths and high signal frequencies contribute to greater signal 
attenuation. For this reason, attenuation on a cable is measured by a cable tester using 
the highest frequencies that the cable is rated to support. 
Figure 4-11 Attenuation
Attenuation is expressed in decibels (dB) using negative numbers. Smaller negative dB 
values are an indication of better link performance.
Several factors contribute to attenuation:
■The resistance of the copper cable converts some of the electrical energy of the 
signal to heat.
■Signal energy is also lost when it leaks through the insulation of the cable and by 
impedance caused by defective connectors.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Impedance is a measurement of the resistance of the cable to alternating current (AC) 
and is measured in ohms. The normal (characteristic) impedance of a CAT 5 cable is 
100 ohms. If a connector is improperly installed on CAT 5, it has a different impedance 
value than the cable. This difference is called an impedance discontinuity or an imped-
ance mismatch.
Impedance discontinuities cause attenuation because a portion of a transmitted signal 
is reﬂected back to the transmitting device rather than continuing to the receiver, much 
like an echo. This effect is compounded if multiple discontinuities cause additional 
portions of the remaining signal to be reﬂected back to the transmitter. When this 
returning reﬂection strikes the ﬁrst discontinuity, some of the signal rebounds in the 
direction of the original signal, creating multiple echo effects. The echoes strike the 
receiver at different intervals making it difﬁcult for the receiver to accurately detect 
data values on the signal. This effect is called jitter and results in data errors.
The combination of the effects of signal attenuation and impedance discontinuities 
on a communications link is called insertion loss. Proper network operation depends 
on constant characteristic impedance in all cables and connectors, with no impedance 
discontinuities in the entire cable system.
Source of Noise on Copper Media
Noise is any electrical energy on the transmission cable that makes it more difﬁcult for 
a receiver to interpret the data sent from the transmitter. TIA/EIA-568-B certiﬁcation 
of a cable now requires testing for a variety of types of noise. UTP does not have any 
shielding from external sources of noise such as nearby motors or ﬂuorescent lights or 
sources inside the cable.
Crosstalk involves the transmission of signals from one wire pair to nearby pairs. When 
voltages change on one pair of wires, electromagnetic energy is generated. This energy 
radiates outward from the transmitting wire pair like a radio signal from a transmitter. 
Adjacent wire pairs in the cable act like antennas generating a weaker but similar elec-
trical signal onto the nearby wire pairs. Crosstalk can cause interference with data that 
might be present on the adjacent wires. Crosstalk can also be caused by signals from a 
completely separate nearby cable. When crosstalk is caused by a signal on another cable, 
it is called alien crosstalk. Crosstalk is more destructive at higher transmission frequencies.
Cable testing instruments measure crosstalk by ﬁrst applying a test signal to one wire 
pair. The cable tester then measures the amplitude of the unwanted crosstalk signals 
induced on the other wire pairs in the cable. At higher transmission frequencies, 
crosstalk increases and is more destructive to data signals.

Undesired crosstalk occurs when the wire pairs are untwisted and thus subject to data 
crosstalk from another wire pair, as shown in Figure 4-12. Therefore, crosstalk can be 
minimized by twisting the wire pairs. The higher the category of UTP, the more twists 
in the cable are necessary to minimize crosstalk even at high transmission frequencies. 
To ensure reliable LAN communications the untwisting of wire pairs must be kept to 
an absolute minimum. This point is especially important to remember when attaching 
connectors to the ends of UTP cable.
Figure 4-12 Connector Vulnerable to Crosstalk
There are three distinct types of crosstalk:
■Near-end crosstalk (NEXT)
■Far-end crosstalk (FEXT)
■Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT)
Near-end crosstalk (NEXT), shown in Figure 4-13, is computed as the ratio in voltage 
amplitude between the test signal and the crosstalk signal when measured from the 
same end of the link. This difference is expressed in a negative value of decibels (dB). 
Low negative numbers indicate more noise, and large negative numbers indicate less 
noise, just as low negative temperatures indicate more heat than large negative temper-
atures. By tradition, cable testers do not show the minus sign indicating the negative 
NEXT values. A NEXT reading of 30 dB (really -30) indicates less NEXT noise and 
a better cable than does a NEXT reading of 10 dB (really -10.)
Bad Connector. Wires are 
untwisted for too great a length.
Good Connector. Wires are only
untwisted to the extent necessary 
to attach the connector.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Figure 4-13 Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT)
NEXT needs to be measured from every pair to every other pair in a UTP link and 
from both ends of the link. To shorten test times, some cable test instruments allow the 
user to test the NEXT performance of a link by using larger frequency step sizes than 
speciﬁed by the TIA/EIA standard. The resulting measurements might not comply with 
TIA/EIA-568-B and might overlook link faults. To verify proper link performance, NEXT 
should be measured from both ends of the link with a high-quality test instrument. 
This veriﬁcation is also a requirement for complete compliance with high-speed cable 
speciﬁcations.
Because of attenuation, crosstalk occurring further away from the transmitter (far-end 
crosstalk [FEXT]) creates less noise on a cable than NEXT, as shown in Figure 4-14. 
The noise caused by FEXT still travels back to the source, but the noise is attenuated 
as it returns. Thus, FEXT is not as signiﬁcant a problem as NEXT.
Figure 4-14 Far-End Crosstalk (FEXT)
Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT), shown in Figure 4-15, measures the cumu-
lative effect of NEXT from all wire pairs in the cable. For each wire pair in the four-pair 
cable, PSNEXT is computed from three pair-to-pair NEXT test results. The combined 
effect of crosstalk from multiple simultaneous transmission sources can be very detri-
mental to the signal. TIA/EIA-568-B certiﬁcation now requires this PSNEXT test.

Figure 4-15 Power Sum Near-End Crosstalk (PSNEXT)
Some Ethernet standards, such as 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, receive data from only 
one wire pair in each direction. However, for newer technologies such as 1000BASE-T 
that receive data simultaneously from multiple pairs in the same direction, power sum 
measurements are important tests.
Cable Testing Standards
The TIA/EIA-568-B standard speciﬁes ten tests that a copper cable must pass if it is to 
be used for modern, high-speed Ethernet LANs. All cable links should be tested to the 
maximum rating that applies for the category of cable being installed.
The primary test parameters that must be veriﬁed for a cable link to meet TIA/EIA-568-B 
standards are as follows:
■Wire map
■Insertion loss
■Near-end crosstalk (NEXT)
■Power sum near-end crosstalk (PSNEXT)
■Equal-level far-end crosstalk (ELFEXT)
■Power sum equal-level far-end crosstalk (PSELFEXT)
■Return loss
■Propagation delay
■Cable length
■Delay skew
The Ethernet standard speciﬁes that each of the pins on an RJ-45 connector has a 
particular purpose, as shown in Figure 4-16. A network interface card (NIC) transmits 
signals on pins 1 and 2, and it receives signals on pins 3 and 6. The wires in UTP cable 
must be connected to the proper pins at each end of a cable. The wire map test insures

that no open or short circuits exist in the cable. An open circuit occurs if the wire does 
not attach properly at the connector. A short circuit occurs if two wires are connected 
to each other.

The wire map test also veriﬁes that all eight wires are connected to the correct pins on 
both ends of the cable. The wire map test can detect several different wiring faults. The 
reversed-pair fault occurs when a wire pair is correctly installed on one connector, but 
reversed on the other connector. If the orange striped wire is on pin 1 and the orange 
wire is on pin 2 at one end, but the orange striped wire is on pin 2 and the orange wire 
is on pin 1 at the other end, then the cable has a reversed-pair fault, as demonstrated in

A split-pair wiring fault occurs when two wires from different wire pairs are connected 
to the wrong pins on both ends of the cable. Look carefully at the pin numbers in Fig-
ure 4-17 to detect the wiring fault. A split pair creates two transmit or receive pairs 
each with two wires that are not twisted together.
Transposed-pair wiring faults occur when a wire pair is connected to completely different 
pins at both ends. Contrast this with a reversed-pair where the same pair of pins is 
used at both ends. Transposed pairs also occur when two different colors codes on 
punch-down blocks (representing T568A and T568B) are used at different locations 
on the same link.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Other Test Parameters
The combination of the effects of signal attenuation and impedance discontinuities 
on a communications link is called insertion loss. Insertion loss increases as data trans-
mission speeds and frequencies increase. Insertion loss is measured in decibels. The 
TIA/EIA-568-B standard requires that a cable and its connectors pass an insertion loss 
test before the cable can be used as a communications link in a LAN.
Crosstalk is measured in four separate tests:
■NEXT
■ELFEXT
■PSELFEXT
■Return loss
A cable tester measures NEXT by applying a test signal to one cable pair and measuring 
the amplitude of the crosstalk signals received by the other cable pairs. The NEXT value, 
expressed in decibels, is computed as the difference in amplitude between the test signal 
and the crosstalk signal measured at the same end of the cable. Remember, because the 
number of decibels that the tester displays is a negative number, the larger the number, 
the lower the NEXT on the wire pair.
The equal-level far-end crosstalk (ELFEXT) test measures FEXT. Pair-to-pair ELFEXT 
is expressed in dB as the difference between the measured FEXT and the insertion loss 
of the wire pair whose signal is disturbed by the FEXT. ELFEXT is an important mea-
surement in Ethernet networks using 1000BASE-T technologies.
Power sum equal-level far-end crosstalk (PSELFEXT) is the combined effect of ELFEXT 
from all wire pairs.
Return loss is a measure in decibels of reﬂections that are caused by the impedance dis-
continuities at all locations along the link. Recall that the main impact of return loss is 
not on loss of signal strength. The signiﬁcant problem is that signal echoes caused by 
the reﬂections from the impedance discontinuities strike the receiver at different intervals 
causing signal jitter.
Time-Based Parameters
Propagation delay is a simple measurement of how long it takes for a signal to travel 
along the cable being tested. The delay in a wire pair depends on its length, twist rate, 
and electrical properties. Delays are measured in the hundredths of nanoseconds (one 
nanosecond is one-billionth of a second, or 0.000000001 second). The TIA/EIA-568-B 
standard sets a limit for propagation delay for the various categories of UTP.

Other Test Parameters

Propagation delay measurements are the basis of the cable length measurement. TIA/
EIA-568-B-1 speciﬁes that the physical length of the link is calculated using the wire 
pair with the shortest electrical delay. Testers measure the length of the wire based on 
the electrical delay as measured by a Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR) test, not the 
physical length of the cable jacket. Because the wires inside the cable are twisted, signals 
actually travel farther than the physical length of the cable. When a cable tester makes 
a TDR measurement it sends a pulse signal down a wire pair and measures the amount 
of time required for the pulse to return on the same wire pair.
The TDR test is used not only to determine length, but also to identify the distance to 
wiring faults such as shorts and opens. When the pulse encounters an open, short, or 
poor connection, all or part of the pulse energy is reﬂected back to the tester, which 
can calculate the approximate distance to the wiring fault. This calculation can be 
helpful in locating a faulty connection point, such as a wall jack, along a cable run.
The propagation delays of different wire pairs in a single cable can differ slightly because 
of differences in the number of twists and electrical properties of each wire pair. The 
delay difference between pairs is called delay skew. Delay skew is a critical parameter 
for high-speed networks in which data is simultaneously transmitted over multiple 
wire pairs, such as 1000BASE-T Ethernet. If the delay skew between the pairs is too 
great, the bits arrive at different times, and the data cannot be properly reassembled. 
Even though a cable link might not be intended for this type of data transmission, test-
ing for delay skew helps ensure that the link supports future upgrades to high-speed 
networks.
All cable links in a LAN must pass all of the tests covered in the preceding text as spec-
iﬁed in the TIA/EIA-568-B standard to ensure that they function reliably at high speeds 
and frequencies. Perform cable tests when the cable is installed, and afterward on a 
regular basis to ensure that LAN cabling meets industry standards. Use high-quality 
cable test instruments correctly to ensure that the tests are accurate. Carefully document 
test results.
Testing Fiber-Optic Cables
A ﬁber link consists of two separate glass ﬁbers functioning as separate and indepen-
dent data pathways. One ﬁber carries transmitted signals in one direction, while the 
second carries signals in the opposite direction. Each glass ﬁber is surrounded by a 
sheath that light cannot pass through, so no crosstalk problems exist on ﬁber-optic 
cable. The jacket, external EMI or noise has no affect on ﬁber cabling. Attenuation 
does occur on ﬁber links, but to a lesser extent than on copper cabling.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Fiber links are subject to the optical equivalent of UTP impedance discontinuities. When 
light encounters an optical discontinuity, some of the light signal is reﬂected back in 
the opposite direction with only a fraction of the original light signal continuing down 
the ﬁber towards the receiver. This results in a reduced amount of light energy arriving 
at the receiver making signal recognition more difﬁcult. Just as with UTP cable, improp-
erly installed connectors are the main cause of light reﬂection and signal strength loss 
in optical ﬁber.
Because noise is not an issue when transmitting on optical ﬁber, the main concern with 
a ﬁber link is the strength of the light signal that arrives at the receiver. If attenuation 
weakens the light signal at the receiver, then data errors result. Testing ﬁber-optic cable 
primarily involves shining a light down the ﬁber and measuring whether a sufﬁcient 
amount of light reaches the receiver.
On a ﬁber-optic link, the acceptable amount of signal power loss that can occur with-
out dropping below the requirements of the receiver must be calculated. This calcula-
tion is referred to as the optical link loss budget. A ﬁber test instrument checks whether 
the optical link loss budget has been exceeded. If the ﬁber fails the test, the cable test 
instrument indicates where the optical discontinuities occur along the length of the 
cable link. Usually, the problem is one or more improperly attached connectors. The cable 
test instrument indicates the location of the faulty connections that must be replaced. 
When the faults are corrected, the cable must be retested.
A New Cabling Standard
On June 20, 2002, the Category 6 (CAT 6) addition to the TIA-568 standard was pub-
lished. The ofﬁcial title of the standard is ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B.2-1. This new standard 
speciﬁes the original set of ten tests for Ethernet cabling and the passing scores for each 
of these tests. Cables certiﬁed as CAT 6 cable must pass all ten tests.
Although the CAT 6 tests are essentially the same as the CAT 5 standard speciﬁes, CAT 6 
cable must pass the tests with higher scores to be certiﬁed. CAT 6 cable must be capa-
ble of carrying frequencies up to 250 MHz and must have lower levels of crosstalk and 
return loss.
A quality cable tester similar to the Fluke DSP-4000 series or Fluke OMNIScanner2 can 
perform all the test measurements required for CAT 5, CAT 5e, and CAT 6 cable certi-
ﬁcations of both permanent links and channel links.

Cabling the LANs
The cabling aspect of the LAN exists at Layer 1 of the OSI reference model. To under-
stand the types of cabling used to cable networking devices, you need to understand the 
LAN physical layer implementation of Ethernet, which is a LAN technology speciﬁed 
at the data link layer.
It is important that you be able to identify the usages of different types of cable and to 
differentiate among the types of connectors that can be used to connect Ethernet.
This section addresses the LAN physical layer implementation and the main principle 
of implementing Ethernet in a campus LAN. This chapter also discusses the different 
types of connectors speciﬁed for Ethernet use as well as the UTP wiring standards.
LAN Physical Layer
Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology. Ethernet was ﬁrst implemented by a 
group called DIX (Digital, Intel, and Xerox). DIX created and implemented the ﬁrst 
Ethernet LAN speciﬁcation, which was used as the basis for the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineer (IEEE) 802.3 speciﬁcation released in 1980. Later, the IEEE 
extended the 802.3 committee to three new committees known as 802.3u (Fast Ether-
net), 802.3z (Gigabit Ethernet over Fiber), and 802.3ab (Gigabit Ethernet over UTP).
The cabling aspect of the LAN exists at Layer 1 of the Open System Interconnection 
(OSI) reference model. Many topologies support LANs, as well as different physical 
media. Figure 4-18 shows a subset of physical layer implementations that you can 
deploy to support Ethernet.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
The symbols for media vary. For example, the symbol for a serial line looks an elongated 
letter z or a lighting bolt; the Ethernet symbol is typically a straight line with perpen-
dicular lines projecting from it; the Token Ring network symbol is a circle with hosts 
attached to it; and for FDDI, the symbol is two concentric circles with attached 
devices, as shown in Figure 4-19.
Figure 4-19 LAN Physical Layer Media Symbols
The basic functions of media are to carry a ﬂow of information, in the form of bits and 
bytes, through a LAN. Other than wireless LANs (that use the atmosphere, or space, 
as the medium), networking media conﬁnes network signals to a wire, cable, or ﬁber. 
Networking media are considered Layer 1 components of LANs.
Computer networks can be built with many different media types. Each media has 
advantages and disadvantages. What is an advantage for one media (CAT 5 cost) might 
be a disadvantage for another (ﬁber-optic cost). The primary advantage and disadvantage 
comparison categories are as follows:
■Cable length
■Cost
■Ease of installation
Coaxial cable, optical ﬁber, and even free space can carry network signals. However, 
the principal medium that is studied is called Category 5 unshielded twisted-pair cable 
(CAT 5 UTP).
Ethernet in the Campus
Given the variety of Ethernet speeds that you can deploy in the campus, you need to 
determine when, if, and where to upgrade to one or more of the Fast Ethernet imple-
mentations. With the correct hardware and cabling infrastructure, 10- or 100-Mbps

Ethernet can be run anywhere in the network. As noted in Table 4-2, 10-Mbps Ether-
net typically is implemented at the end-user level to connect to desktops, and faster 
technologies are used to interconnect to servers and network devices, such as routers 
and switches.
In today’s installations, although customers are providing Gigabit Ethernet from the 
backbone to the end user, costs for cabling and switch ports can make this prohibitive. 
Before making this decision, you must determine network requirements. For example, a 
network running at traditional Ethernet speeds of 10 Mbps can be easily overwhelmed 
with the new generation of multimedia, imaging, and database products.
In general, you can use Ethernet technologies in a campus LAN in several different ways:
■An Ethernet speed of Fast Ethernet can be used at the user level to provide good 
performance. Also, Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet can be used for clients or 
servers that consume high bandwidth.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
■Fast Ethernet is often used as the link between the user-level and network devices, 
supporting the aggregate trafﬁc from each Ethernet segment on the access link.
■Many client/server networks suffer from too many clients trying to access the 
same server, creating a bottleneck where the server attaches to the LAN. To enhance 
client/server performance across the campus LAN and avoid bottlenecks at the 
server, you can use Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet links to connect enterprise 
servers. Fast Ethernet or Gigabit Ethernet creates an effective solution for avoid-
ing slow networks.
■You also can use Fast Ethernet links to provide the connection between the 
workgroup level and the backbone. Because the campus LAN model supports 
dual links between each workgroup router and backbone switch, you can load 
balance the aggregate trafﬁc from multiple-access switches across the links.
■You can use Fast Ethernet (or Gigabit Ethernet) between switches and the back-
bone. Implement the fastest medium affordable between backbone switches.
Ethernet Media and Connector Requirement
In addition to network need, and before selecting an Ethernet implementation, you 
must consider the media and connector requirements for each implementation. The 
cables and connector speciﬁcations used to support Ethernet implementations are 
derived from the Electronic Industries Association and (newer) Telecommunications 
Industry Association (EIA/TIA) standards body. The categories of cabling deﬁned for 
the Ethernet are derived from the EIA/TIA-568 (SP-2840) Commercial Building Tele-
communications Wiring Standards. The EIA/TIA speciﬁes an RJ-45 connector for UTP 
cable. The letters RJ stand for registered jack, and the number 45 refers to the physical 
connector that has eight conductors.
Table 4-3 compares the cable and connector speciﬁcations for the most popular Ether-
net implementations. The important difference to note is the medium used for 10-Mbps 
Ethernet versus 100-Mbps and 1000-Mbps Ethernet. In today’s networks, in which 
you see a mix of 10- and 1000-Mbps requirements, you must be aware of the need to 
change over to UTP CAT 5 to support Fast Ethernet.
Figure 4-20 illustrates some of different connection types used by the physical layer 
implementation.

Figure 4-20 Differentiating Among Connections
Connection Media
This section brieﬂy discusses the connection types used by physical layer implementa-
tion and an interface device, Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC), used between the 
Ethernet and ﬁber-optic systems. This section covers the following topics:
■RJ-45—A connector commonly used for ﬁnishing a twisted-pair cable
■AUI—A connector that interfaces between a computer’s NIC or router interface 
and an Ethernet cable
■GBIC—A device used as an interface between the Ethernet and ﬁber-optic systems
RJ-45
The RJ-45 connector and jack are the most prevalent. RJ-45 connectors are discussed 
in more detail in the section, “UTP Implementation” later in the chapter.
Attachment Unit Interface
In some cases, the type of connector on a NIC does not match the type of media that it 
needs to connect to. An interface exists for the AUI connector. The AUI is the 15-pin 
physical connector interface between a computer’s NIC and Ethernet cable. On 10BASE5 
(thicknet) Ethernet, a short cable is used to connect the AUI on the computer with a 
transceiver on the main cable. In 10BASE2 (thinnet) Ethernet networks, the NIC con-
nects directly to the Ethernet coaxial cable at the back of the computer.
Gigabit Interface Converter
A Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC) is a hot-swappable input/output device that 
plugs into a Gigabit Ethernet port. A key beneﬁt of using a GBIC is that GBICs are 
interchangeable. This feature gives users the ﬂexibility to deploy other 1000BASE-X 
technology without needing to change the physical interface/module on the router or 
switch.

The ﬁber-optic GBIC is a transceiver that converts serial electric currents to optical sig-
nals and that also coverts optical signals to digital electric currents. Some of the optical 
GBICs include the following:
■Short wavelength (1000BASE-SX)
■Long wavelength/long haul (1000BASE-LX/LH)
■Extended distance (1000BASE-ZX)
Typically, the GBIC is used as an interface between the Ethernet and ﬁber-optic systems, 
such as Fiber Channel and Gigabit Ethernet. Figure 4-21 shows a GBIC, and Figure 4-22 
shows a Cisco WS-X2931 Gigabit Ethernet Module with the GBIC out.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
UTP Implementation
If you look at the RJ-45 transparent end connector, you can see eight colored wires. 
These wires are twisted into four pairs. Four of the wires (two pairs) carry the positive, 
or true, voltage and are considered “tip” (T1 through T4); the other four wires carry 
the inverse, or false, voltage grounded and are called “ring” (R1 through R4). Tip and
ring are terms that originated in the early days of the telephone. Today, these terms 
refer to the positive and the negative wire in a pair. The wires in the ﬁrst pair in a cable 
or a connector are designated as T1 and R1, the second pair is T2 and R2, and so on.
The RJ-45 plug is the male component, crimped at the end of the cable. As you look 
at the male connector from the front, with the clip facing down, the pin locations are 
numbered from 8 on the left down to 1 on the right, as shown in Figure 4-23. The 
jack, shown in Figure 4-24, is the female component in a network device, wall or cubi-
cle partition outlet, or patch panel. As you look at the device port, the corresponding 
female pin locations are 1 on the left up to 8 on the right.
Figure 4-23 Pin Locations on the RJ-45 Connector
For electricity to run between the connector and the jack, the order of the wires must fol-
low EIA/TIA-568-A and EIA/TIA-568-B standards, as shown previously in Figure 4-16.
In addition to identifying the correct EIA/TIA category of cable to use for a connecting 
device (which depends on what standard is being used by the jack on the network 
device), you need to determine which of the following to use:
■A straight-through cable—A cable that maintains the pin connection all the way 
through the cable. Thus, the wire connected to pin 1 is the same on both ends of 
the cable.
■A crossover cable—A cable that crosses the critical pair to properly align, trans-
mit, and receive signals on the device with line connections.

If the two RJ-45 ends of a cable are held side by side in the same orientation, the col-
ored wires (or strips or pins) are seen at each connector end. If the order of the colored 
wires is the same at each end, the cable is straight-through. Figure 4-25 illustrates that 
the RJ-45 connectors on both ends show all the wires in the same order.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Speciﬁed for Ethernet, in a CAT 5 UTP cable, only wires 1, 2, 3, and 6 are used for 
transmit (TD) and receive (RD) signals. The other four wires are not used. As shown 
on the left of Figure 4-25, in a straight-through cable, the RJ-45 pins 1, 2, 3, and 6 at 
one end are connected to pins 1, 2, 3, and 6 at the other end of the connection. Gigabit 
Ethernet, however, uses all eight wires.
You can use a straight-through cable to connect devices such as PCs or routers to other 
devices used as hubs or switches. As Figure 4-26 shows, you should use straight-through 
when only one port is designated with an x.
Figure 4-26 Interconnecting Devices Using Straight-Through Cable
With crossover cable, the RJ-45 connectors on both ends show that some of the wires 
on one side of the cable are crossed to a different pin on the other side of the cable. 
Speciﬁcally for Ethernet, pin 1 at one RJ-45 end should connect to pin 3 at the other 
end. Pin 2 at one end should connect to pin 6 at the other end, as shown in Figure 4-27.

You can use a crossover cable to connect similar devices, switch to switch or switch to 
hub. Figure 4-28 shows that you use a crossover cable when both ports are designated

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
LAN Connection Devices
Many types of devices are connected to make up a LAN. These are called the LAN 
hardware components. This section discusses some of the common hardware compo-
nents that are used in a LAN environment. LAN devices can include repeaters, hubs, 
bridges, switches, and routers with switches being the most prevalent device in modern 
LANs.
Repeaters
As mentioned in the section, “LAN Physical Layer” and shown in Figure 4-19, many 
types of media exist, and each one has advantages and disadvantages. One of the dis-
advantages of the CAT 5 UTP cable that is primarily used is cable length. The maximum 
length for UTP cable in a network is 100 meters (approximately 333 feet). If you have 
to expand the network beyond that limit, you need to add a repeater. In most Ethernet 
networks this repeater normally takes the form of hub, which is a multiport repeater, or 
a newer technology switch.
The term repeater comes from the early days of visual communication when a person 
situated on a hill would repeat the signal that was just received from the person on the 
previous hill to communicate the signal to the person on the next hill. Telegraph, tele-
phone, microwave, and optical communications all use repeaters to strengthen their 
signals over long distances.
The purpose of a repeater, shown in Figures 4-29 and 4-30, is to regenerate and retime 
network signals at the bit level to allow them to travel a longer distance on the media. 
Repeaters are commonly used if too many network nodes exist or the number of cables 
is insufﬁcient. The Four Repeater Rule for 10 Mbps bus-based Ethernet, also know as 
the 5-4-3 Rule, is used as a standard when extending LAN segments. This rule states that 
no more than ﬁve network segments can be connected end-to-end using four repeaters, 
but only three segments can have hosts (computers) on them. Although the 5-4-3 rule 
is important when applied to bus-based networks, it does not have much validity with 
switches and extended star topologies.

Figure 4-30 Repeaters Connect Two End Nodes
Hubs
Hubs are actually multiport repeaters. In many cases, the difference between the two 
devices is the number of ports that each provides. While a typical repeater has just 2 
ports, a hub generally has from 4 to 24 ports, as shown in Figure 4-31. Additionally, 
hubs are most commonly used in Ethernet 10BASE-T or 100BASE-T networks, 
although other network architectures use them as well.

Figure 4-31 Eight-Port Hub
Using a hub changes the network topology from a linear bus, where each device plugs 
directly into the wire, to a star. With hubs, data arriving over the cables to a hub port 
is electrically repeated on all the other ports connected to the same network segment, 
except for the port on which the data was sent.
Hubs come in two basic types:
■Active—An active hub must be plugged into an electrical outlet because it needs 
power to amplify the incoming signal before passing it out to the other ports.
■Intelligent—An intelligent hub are sometimes called smart hubs. These devices 
basically function as active hubs, but also include a microprocessor chip and 
diagnostic capabilities. They are more expensive than active hubs, but are useful 
in troubleshooting situations.
All devices that are attached to a hub hear all trafﬁc. Therefore, hubs maintain a single 
collision domain. A collision is a situation where two end stations send data over the 
network wire at the same time.
Sometimes, hubs are called concentrators because they serve as a central connection 
point for an Ethernet LAN.
Bridges
At times, you need to break up a large LAN into smaller, more easily managed seg-
ments. This strategy decreases the amount of trafﬁc on a single LAN and can extend

the geographical area past what a single LAN can support, as shown in Figure 4-32. 
The devices that are used to connect network segments together include bridges, switches, 
routers, and gateways. Switches and bridges operate at the data link layer of the OSI 
model. The function of the bridge is to make intelligent decisions about whether or not 
to pass signals on to the next segment of a network. Bridges can also be used to connect 
dissimilar protocols and media as with wireless bridges interconnecting Ethernet LANs 
in a metropolitan area.
Figure 4-32 Bridges Segmenting a Network
When a bridge receives a frame on the network, the destination MAC address is 
looked up in the bridge table to determine whether to ﬁlter, ﬂood, or copy the frame 
onto another segment. This decision process occurs as follows:
■If the destination device is on the same segment as the frame, the bridge blocks 
the frame from going on to other segments, as shown in Figure 4-33. This pro-
cess is known as ﬁltering.
■If the destination device is on a different segment, the bridge forwards the frame 
to the appropriate segment, as shown in Figure 4-34.

■If the destination address is unknown to the bridge, the bridge forwards the 
frame to all segments except the one on which it was received. This process is 
known as ﬂooding.
If placed strategically, a bridge greatly improves network performance.
Switches
A switch is sometimes described as a multiport bridge. While a typical bridge might 
have just two ports (linking two network segments), the switch can have multiple ports 
depending on how many network segments are to be linked. Like bridges, switches learn 
certain information about the data packets that they receive from various computers 
on the network. They use this information to build forwarding tables to determine the 
destination of data being sent by one computer to another computer on the network as 
demonstrated in Figure 4-35.
Figure 4-35 Switching Table
Although some similarities exist between the two, a switch is a more sophisticated 
device than a bridge. A bridge determines whether the frame is forwarded to the other 
network segment based on the destination MAC address. A switch has many ports 
with many network segments connected to them. A switch chooses the port to which 
the destination device or workstation is connected. Ethernet switches are becoming 
popular connectivity solutions because, like bridges, they improve network performance 
(speed and bandwidth).
Switching is a technology that alleviates congestion in Ethernet LANs by reducing traf-
ﬁc and increasing bandwidth. Switches often replace shared hubs because they work 
with existing cable infrastructures, which improves performance with a minimum of 
intrusion into an existing network.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Today, in data communications, all switching equipment performs two basic operations:
■Switching data frames—The process by which a frame is received on an input 
medium and then transmitted to an output medium.
■Maintenance of switching operations—Switches build and maintain switching 
tables and search for loops.
Switches operate at much higher speeds than bridges and can support other functional-
ity, such as virtual LANs.
An Ethernet switch has many beneﬁts, such as allowing many users to communicate in 
parallel through the use of virtual circuits and dedicated network segments in a virtually 
collision-free environment, as shown in Figure 4-36. This arrangement maximizes the 
bandwidth available on the shared medium. Another beneﬁt is that moving to a switched 
LAN environment is very cost effective because existing hardware and cabling can be 
reused.

Wireless Networking Media
A wireless network is an alternative method for connecting a LAN. You don’t need 
to run any cables, and you can easily move computers. Wireless networks use radio 
frequency (RF), laser, infrared (IR), or satellite/microwaves to carry signals from one

computer to another without a permanent cable connection. Wireless signals are elec-
tromagnetic waves that travel through the air. No physical medium is necessary for 
wireless signals, making them a very versatile way to build a network.
A common application of wireless data communication is for mobile use. Some examples 
of mobile use include commuters, airplanes, satellites, remote space probes, space 
shuttles, and space stations.
At the core of wireless communication are devices called transmitters and receivers. 
The source interacts with the transmitter that converts data to electromagnetic (EM) 
waves that are then received by the receiver. The receiver then converts these electro-
magnetic waves back into data for the destination. For two-way communication, each 
device requires a transmitter and a receiver. Many networking device manufacturers 
build the transmitter and receiver into a single unit called a transceiver or wireless net-
work card. All devices in wireless LANs (WLANs) must have the appropriate wireless 
network card installed.
The two most common wireless technologies used for networking are infrared (IR) 
and radio frequency (RF). IR technology has its weaknesses. Workstations and digital 
devices must be in the line of sight of the transmitter to operate. An IR-based network 
suits environments where all the digital devices that require network connectivity are 
in one room. IR networking technology can be installed quickly, but the data signals 
can be weakened or obstructed by people walking across the room or by moisture in 
the air. However, new IR technologies that can work out of sight are being developed.
RF technology allows devices to be in different rooms or even buildings. The limited 
range of the radio signals still restricts the use of this kind of network. RF technology can 
be on single or multiple frequencies. A single radio frequency is subject to outside inter-
ference and geographic obstructions. Furthermore, a single frequency is easily monitored 
by others, which makes the transmissions of data insecure. Spread spectrum avoids the 
problem of insecure data transmission by using multiple frequencies to increase the 
immunity to noise and to make it difﬁcult for outsiders to intercept data transmissions.
Security in the Wireless Environment
The exponential growth of networking, including wireless technologies, has led to 
increased security risks. Increasing the security means increasing the time spent manag-
ing the system.
The ﬁrst level of security in a wireless LAN consists of protecting the radio frequency 
waveform itself. Wireless access points radiate radio waves over a large area that 
is not contained in a physical building, which makes the radio waves accessible to 
eavesdroppers and thus increases vulnerability. The radio waves of wireless bridges are

224
Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
concentrated in a beam. An eavesdropper must get into the beam path to intercept the 
communication. Therefore, wireless access points usually require better security than 
wireless bridges.
If you think someone might eavesdrop on your LAN radio links, encryption is the key.
The following sections discuss two wireless security approaches: wired equivalent 
privacy (WEP) and IEEE 802.1X or Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
WEP
WEP is the ﬁrst step in addressing customer security concerns. WEP is a security mech-
anism, deﬁned within the 802.11 standard, that is designed to protect the over-the-air 
transmission between wireless LAN access points and NICs. The IEEE 802.11b requires 
40-bit encryption keys. However, many vendors, such as Cisco, support the optional 
128-bit standard.
The main goals of WEP are
■Deny access to the network by unauthorized users who do not possess the appro-
priate WEP key
■Prevent the decoding of captured WLAN trafﬁc that is WEP-encrypted without 
the possession of the WEP key
WEP uses the RC4 stream cipher that was invented by Ron Rivest of RSA Data Secu-
rity, Inc., (RSADSI) for encryption. The RC4 encryption algorithm is a symmetric-stream 
cipher that supports a variable-length key. A symmetric cipher uses the same key for 
both encryption and decryption. The key is the one piece of information that must be 
shared by both the encrypting and decrypting endpoints.
Recently, encryption analysts have reported weaknesses in the authentication and WEP 
encryption schemes in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard. Improvements on WEP have 
been developed to address the weaknesses found by encryption analysts. However, it is 
not recommended to use WEP as a sole security mechanism for a WLAN. WEP should 
be supplemented with additional higher-level security mechanisms such as Virtual Private 
Networks (VPNs) or ﬁrewalls.
802.1X/EAP
IEEE 802.1X/Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an alternative WLAN security 
approach to WEP, as speciﬁed by IEEE 802.11. IEEE 802.1X/EAP focuses on developing 
a framework for providing centralized authentication and dynamic key distribution. 
IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control. EAP allows wireless
client adapters that can support different authentication types to communicate with dif-
ferent back-end servers, such as Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS).
chpt_04.fm  Page 224  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  9:01 AM

225
Cisco Systems has developed a derivation of EAP based on mutual authentication, called 
Lightweight EAP (LEAP). Mutual authentication means that both the user and the access 
point to which the user is attempting to connect must be authenticated before access 
onto the corporate network is allowed. Mutual authentication protects enterprises from 
unauthorized access points serving as a potential entrance into the network.
The Cisco LEAP authentication provides the following beneﬁts:
■Centralized authentication and key distribution
■Large-scale enterprise WLAN deployment because of its broad operating system 
support and dynamic key derivation
Host LAN Connectivity: NICs and Interfaces
In terms of appearance, a NIC, shown in Figure 4-37 and 4-38, is a printed circuit 
board that ﬁts into the expansion slot of a bus on a computer’s motherboard or 
peripheral device. It is also called a network adapter. On laptop/notebook computers, 
NICs are usually the size of a credit card. Its function is to connect the host device to 
the network medium.
Figure 4-37 Network Interface Card (Circuit Board)
NICs operate at both Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model. NICs are considered Layer 2 
devices because each individual NIC throughout the world carries a unique code, called 
a Media Access Control (MAC) address. This address controls data communication for 
the host on the network. Layer 2 devices, such as a bridge or switch, use each individual 
NIC’s MAC address. This MAC address controls data communication for the host on 
the network. You learn more about the MAC address in later chapters. As its name 
implies, the NIC controls the host’s access to the medium. For this reason, a NIC also 
works at Layer 1 because it looks only at bits and not at any address information or 
higher-level protocols. NICs typically have the transceiver built-in.

226
Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Figure 4-38 Network Interface Card (Media Connection)
In some cases, the type of connector on the NIC does not match the type of media that 
needs to be connected to it. A good example is a Cisco 2500 router. On the router, the 
Ethernet interface is an AUI connector and that connector needs to connect to a UTP 
CAT 5 Ethernet cable. To do this, a transceiver (transmitter/receiver) is used. The 
Ethernet transceiver provides the transmit/receive function (because none is built into 
the Ethernet interface) and at the same time converts one type of signal or connector to 
another (for example, to connect a 15-pin AUI interface to an RJ-45 jack).
In diagrams,  NICs have no standardized symbol. It is implied that, when networking 
devices are attached to network media, a NIC or NIC-like is device present. Wherever 
a dot is seen on a topology map, it represents either a NIC or an interface (port), which 
acts like a NIC.
Workstation and Server Relationships
By using LAN and WAN technologies, many computers are interconnected to provide 
services to their users. To accomplish this, networked computers take on different roles 
or functions in relation to each other. Some types of applications require computers 
to function as equal partners. Other types of applications distribute their work so that 
one computer functions to serve a number of others in an unequal relationship. In 
either case, two computers typically communicate with each other by using request/
response protocols. One computer issues a request for a service, and a second computer 
receives and responds to that request. The requestor takes on the role of a client, and 
the responder takes on the role of a server.
chpt_04.fm  Page 226  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  9:01 AM

Workstation and Server Relationships
227
Peer-to-Peer Networks
In a peer-to-peer network, the networked computers act as equal partners, or peers, to 
each other. Peer-to-peer networks are also referred to as workgroups. As peers, each 
computer can take on the client function or the server function. At one time, for example, 
computer A might make a request for a ﬁle from computer B, which responds by serv-
ing the ﬁle to computer A. Computer A functions as client, while B functions as the 
server. At a later time, computers A and B can reverse roles. B, as client, makes a print 
request of A, which has a shared printer attached, and A, as server, responds to the 
request from B. A and B stand in a reciprocal or peer relationship to each other.
In a peer-to-peer network, individual users control their own resources. They can 
decide to share certain ﬁles with other users, as shown in Figure 4-39 and Figure 4-40. 
They might also require passwords before they allow others to access their resources. 
Because individual users make these decisions, no central point of control or adminis-
tration exists in the network. In addition, individual users must back up their own 
systems to be able to recover from data loss in case of failures. When a computer acts 
as a server, the user of that machine might experience reduced performance as the 
machine serves the requests made by other systems.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Figure 4-40 Shared File
Peer-to-peer networks are relatively easy to install and operate. No additional equip-
ment is necessary beyond a suitable operating system installed on each computer. Most 
modern desktop operating systems provide support for peer-to-peer networking. 
Because users control their own resources, no dedicated administrators are needed.
A peer-to-peer network works well with a small number of computers, perhaps ten 
or fewer. As networks grow, peer-to-peer relationships become increasingly difﬁcult to 
coordinate and manage. Because they do not scale well, their efﬁciency decreases rapidly 
as the number of computers on the network increases. Also, individual users control 
access to the resources on their computers, which means security might be difﬁcult to 
maintain. The client/server model of network can be used to overcome the limitations 
of the peer-to-peer network.
Client/Server Networks
In a client-server arrangement, network services are located on a dedicated computer 
called a server, which responds to the requests of clients, as shown in Figure 4-41. The 
server is a central computer that is continuously available to respond to a client’s requests 
for ﬁle, print, application, and other services. Most network operating systems (NOSs) 
adopt the form of client-server relationships. Typically, desktop computers function as 
clients and one or more computers with additional processing power, memory, and 
specialized software function as servers.

Workstation and Server Relationships
229
Figure 4-41 Client-Server Model
Servers are designed to handle requests from many clients simultaneously, as shown in 
Figure 4-42. Before a client can access the server resources, the user must be identiﬁed 
and be authorized to use the resource. You handle this authorization by assigning each 
user an account name and password that is veriﬁed by an authentication service acting 
as a sentry to guard access to the network. By centralizing user accounts, security, and 
access control, server-based networks simplify the work of network administration.
The concentration of network resources such as ﬁles, printers, and applications on 
servers also makes the data they generate easier to back up and maintain. Rather than 
having these resources spread around individual machines, they can be located on 
specialized, dedicated servers for easier access. Most client-server systems also include 
facilities for enhancing the network by adding new services that extend the usefulness 
of the network.
The distribution of functions in client-server networks brings substantial advantages, 
but it also incurs some costs. Although the aggregation of resources on server systems 
brings greater security, simpler access, and coordinated control, the server introduces a 
single point of failure into the network. Without an operational server, the network 
cannot function at all. Servers require a trained, expert staff to administer and main-
tain. This requirement increases the expense of running the network. Server systems 
also require additional hardware and specialized software that add to the cost.

Cabling the WAN
231
Cabling the WAN
To connect one network to other remote networks, it is sometimes necessary to utilize 
wide-area network (WAN) services. WAN services provide different connection methods, 
and the cabling standards differ from those of LANs. Therefore, it is therefore to for 
you to understand the types of cabling needed to connect to these services.
This section explains the cabling and connectors that are used to interconnect switches 
and routers in a LAN or WAN. This section also discusses how to cable routers for 
serial connection, Integrated Services Digital Network Basic Rate Interface (ISDN BRI) 
connection, digital subscriber line (DSL) connection, and cable connection, as well as 
how to set up console connection.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
WAN Physical Layer
Many physical implementations carry trafﬁc across the WAN. Needs vary, depending 
on the distance of the equipment from the services, the speed, and the actual service 
itself. Figure 4-43 lists a subset of data link and physical implementations that support 
some of the more prominent WAN solutions today. The type of physical layer you 
choose depends on the distance, speed, and the type of interface you need to connect.
Figure 4-43 WAN Physical Layer Implementations
Serial connections are used to support WAN services such as dedicated leased lines that 
run the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or Frame Relay. The speed of these connections 
ranges from 2400 bps to T1 (1.544 Mbps).
Other WAN services, such as the ISDN, offer dial-on-demand connections or dial-
backup services. An ISDN BRI is composed of two 64-kbps bearer channels (B channels) 
for data, and one delta channel (D channel) at 16 kbps used for signaling and other 
link-management tasks. PPP typically is used to carry data over the B channels.
The increasing demand for residential broadband (high-speed) services has increased 
the popularity for DSL and cable modem connections. DSL service can achieve T1/E1 
speeds over the existing telephone line. Cable services, which work over the existing 
coaxial cable TV line, also offer high-speed connectivity matching or surpassing that 
of DSL.
WAN Serial Connections
Serial transmission is a method of data transmission in which bits of data are transmitted 
sequentially over a single channel. This one-at-a-time transmission contrasts with 
parallel data transmission, which transmits several bits at a time. For long-distance 
communication, WANs use serial transmission. To carry the energy represented in bits, 
serial channels use a speciﬁc electromagnetic or optical frequency range.
chpt_04.fm  Page 232  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  9:01 AM

Cabling the WAN
233
Frequencies, described in terms of their cycles per second (hertz), function as a band or 
spectrum for communication. For example, the signals transmitted over voice-grade 
telephone lines use up to 3 kHz (kilohertz, or thousand hertz). The size of this frequency 
range is called the bandwidth.
Another way to express bandwidth is to specify the amount of data in bits per second 
that the serial channel can carry.
Table 4-6 compares physical standards for EIA/TIA-232 and EIA/TIA-449, v.35, X.21, 
and EIA-530 WAN serial connection options.
Several types of physical connections enable you to connect to serial WAN services. You 
must select the correct serial cable type to use with the router, depending on the physi-
cal implementation that you choose or the physical implementation that your service 
provider imposes. Figure 4-44 shows all the different serial connector options available. 
Serial connectors are used to connect end-user devices and service providers. Note that 
serial ports on Cisco routers use a proprietary 60-pin connector or smaller “smart 
serial” connector, which enables two serial connections on a WAN interface card. The 
type of connector on the other end of the cable is dependent on the service provider or 
end-device requirements, but V.35 is quite common.

Figure 4-44 WAN Serial Connection Options
Routers and Serial Connections
In addition to determining the cable type, you need to determine whether you need 
data terminal equipment (DTE) or data communications equipment (DCE) connectors 
for your equipment. The DTE is the endpoint of the user’s device on the WAN link. The 
DCE is the device used to convert the user data from the DTE into a form acceptable to 
the facility providing WAN services.
As shown in Figure 4-45, if connecting directly to a service provider or to a device that 
performs signal clocking (such as a channel service unit/data service unit [CSU/DSU]), 
the router is a DTE and needs a DTE serial cable. This situation is typically the case for 
routers.

Clocking is a method 
used to synchronize 
data transmission 
between devices. In 
a WAN serial connec-
tion, the CSU/DSU 
controls the clocking 
of the transmitted 
data.

However, in some cases the router must be the DCE, as shown in Figure 4-46. For 
example, if performing a back-to-back router scenario (meaning that routers are used 
at both ends of the connection) in a test environment, one of the routers is a DTE, and 
the other is a DCE to provide the clock.
Figure 4-46 Back-to-Back Serial Connection
When you are cabling routers for serial connectivity, the routers have either ﬁxed or 
modular ports. The type of port being used affects the syntax that you use later to con-
ﬁgure each interface.
Figure 4-47 shows an example of a router with ﬁxed serial ports (interfaces). Each port 
is given a label of port type and port number—for example, serial 0. To conﬁgure a ﬁxed 
interface, you specify the interface using the port type and port number convention—
for example, Serial 0.
Figure 4-47 Fixed Interfaces
Figure 4-48 shows examples of routers with modular serial ports. Usually, each port 
is given a label of port type, slot (the location of the module), and port number. To 
conﬁgure a port on a modular card, you are asked to specify the interface using the 
convention “port type slot number/port number”—for example, serial 1/0, in which 
the type of interface is a serial interface, the slot number where the serial interface 
module is installed is slot 1, and the speciﬁc port that you are referencing on that serial 
interface module is port 0.

Routers and ISDN BRI Connections
With ISDN BRI, you can use two types of interfaces: BRI S/T and BRI U. In ISDN BRI 
service, a user (U) interface is the electrical interface for the twisted-pair wire connec-
tion from a user to a Network Termination 1 (NT1) device. A terminal (T) interface is 
the electrical interface between an NT1 device and an NT 2 device, which is usually a 
private branch exchange (PBX). A system (S) interface is the electrical interface between 
an NT1 and ISDN devices such as a computer or a telephone. In BRI, the T interface is 
electrically identical to the S interface. Thus, the two interfaces are typically combined 
in a single interface, referenced as an S/T interface.
To determine which interface type you need, you must ﬁnd out whether you or the ser-
vice provider provides an NT1 device. An NT1 device is an intermediate device between 
Lab Activity
Connecting Router LAN Interfaces
In this lab, you identify the Ethernet or Fast Ethernet interfaces on the router. 
Then identify and locate the proper cables to connect the routers to hubs or 
switches. Finally, use the cables to connect the router and computers to the hub 
or switch.
Lab Activity
Building a Basic Routed WAN
In this lab, you connect two simple LANs, each consisting of a workstation 
and a switch (or hub), to form a basic router-to-router WAN.

the router and the service-provider ISDN switch (cloud) that is used to connect four-
wire subscriber wiring to the conventional two-wire local loop. In North America, the 
customer typically provides the NT1; in the rest of the world, the service provider pro-
vides the NT1 device.
If the NT1 device needs to be provided by the customer, an ISDN BRI with a U interface 
can be used. A U interface has an NT1 built in. If an external NT1 device is used or if 
the service provider uses an NT1 device, the router needs an ISDN BRI S/T interface. 
Because routers can have multiple ISDN interface types, the interface needed must 
be determined when the router is purchased. Some routers have both a U and an S/T 
interface. The type of ISDN connector that the router has can be determined by look-
ing at the port label. Figure 4-49 shows the different port types for the ISDN interface.
Figure 4-49 Cabling Routers for ISDN Connections
To interconnect the ISDN BRI port on the router to the service-provider device, use a 
UTP CAT 5 straight-through cable with RJ-45 connectors. Note that the ISDN BRI 
cable pinouts are different than the pinouts for Ethernet. Table 4-7 shows the ISDN 
BRI S/T interface connector pinouts.
CAUTION
It is important to 
insert a cable running 
from an ISDN BRI 
port only to an ISDN 
jack or an ISDN 
switch. ISDN BRI
uses voltages that 
can seriously damage 
non-ISDN devices.

Routers and DSL Connections
DSL technology is a modem technology that enables inexpensive, high-speed digital 
transmission over existing twisted-pair telephone lines. For most small ofﬁces or home 
ofﬁces today, DSL technology is a good choice for many business applications, such as 
ﬁle transfer and access to a corporate intranet. Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) 
is the most common and is part of a larger family of technologies generically referred 
to as xDSL.
The Cisco 800 series of ﬁxed-conﬁguration DSL routers provides enhanced security, 
low cost of ownership, proven reliability, and safe investment through the power of 
Cisco IOS Software tailored for small ofﬁces and telecommuters.
The Cisco 827-4V ADSL router has one ADSL interface, as shown in Figure 4-50, that 
can connect users to the Internet or to a corporate LAN via DSL.

To connect an ADSL line to the ADSL port on a router, perform the following simple 
steps:
Step 1
Connect the phone cable to the ADSL port on the router.
Step 2
Connect the other end of the phone cable to the external wall phone jack.
To connect a router for DSL service, you need a phone cable with RJ-11 connectors. DSL 
works over standard telephone lines. It uses only two pins on the RJ-11 connector, as 
shown in Table 4-8.
Routers and Cable Connections
Cable modems enable two-way, high-speed data transmissions using the same coaxial 
lines that transmit cable television. Some cable service providers are promising data 
speeds up to six and a half times that of T1 leased lines. With the demand for broad-
band services, cable modem connection is becoming more popular.
The Cisco uBR905 cable access router provides high-speed network access on the cable 
television system to residential and Small Ofﬁce, Home Ofﬁce (SOHO) subscribers. 
The uBR905 router has a coaxial cable (F-connector) interface that can be connected 
to a cable system. Coaxial cable and an F connector are used to connect the router and 
cable system. The coaxial cable can be either radio grade 59 (RG-59) or RG-6, although 
RG-6 is recommended.
To connect the Cisco uBR905 cable access router to the cable system, follow these 
steps:
Step 1
Verify that the router is not connected to power.
Step 2
Locate the RF coaxial cable coming from the coaxial cable CATV wall 
outlet.

NOTE
RF coaxial cable con-
nects radio frequen-
cies to antennas. The 
majority of cable TV 
systems use coaxial 
cable as their wiring 
system. The main 
trunk lines that 
run from the cable 
provider to a neigh-
borhood distribution 
boxes might be ﬁber-
optic, but coaxial 
cables are likely to be 
used in runs between 
the distribution boxes 
and the end user.

Step 3
Install a cable splitter/directional coupler, if needed, to separate signals 
for TV and computer use. If necessary, also install a high-pass ﬁlter to 
prevent interference between the TV and computer signals.
Step 4
Connect the coaxial cable to the F connector of the router, as shown in 
Figure 4-51. Hand-tighten the connector, making sure that it is ﬁnger-tight, 
and then give it a 1/6 turn with a wrench.
Figure 4-51 F Connector
Step 5
Make sure that all other coaxial cable connectors—all intermediate split-
ters, couplers, or ground blocks—are securely tightened from the distribu-
tion tap to the Cisco uBR905 router, following the instructions in Step 4.
Setting Up Console Connections
To initially conﬁgure your Cisco device, you need to provide a management connec-
tion directly to the device. For Cisco equipment, this management attachment is called 
a console port. The console port enables you to monitor and conﬁgure a Cisco hub, 
switch, or router.
The cable used between a terminal and a console port is a rollover cable with RJ-45 
connectors, as illustrated in Figure 4-52.
Figure 4-52 Setting Up a Console Connection
CAUTION
Do not overtighten 
the connector; doing 
so can break off the 
connector. Use of a 
torque wrench is 
not recommended 
because of the danger 
of tightening the con-
nector more than 
the recommended 
1/6 turn after it is 
ﬁnger-tight.

The rollover cable, also known as a console cable, has a different pinout than the 
straight-through or crossover RJ-45 cables used with Ethernet or the ISDN BRI. The 
pinout for a rollover is as follows:
1 to 8
2 to 7
3 to 6
4 to 5
5 to 4
6 to 3
7 to 2
8 to 1
To set up a connection between your terminal and the Cisco console port, you must 
perform the following steps:
Step 1
Cable the devices using a rollover cable. You likely need an RJ-45-to-DB-9 
or an RJ-45-to-DB-25 adapter for your PC or terminal.
Step 2
Conﬁgure your terminal emulation application with the following com-
mon equipment (COM) port settings:
■9600 bps
■8 data bits
■No parity
■1 stop bit
■No ﬂow control

Troubleshooting Interconnected Devices
In this lab, you create a simplerouted WAN with two PCs, two switches (or 
hubs), and two routers. You conﬁgure workstation IP addresses. You then 
identify and correct networking problems related to cabling issues and work-
station IP addressing issues.
NOTE
The auxiliary (AUX) 
port on the router is 
used to provide remote 
management through 
a modem. The AUX 
port must be conﬁg-
ured using the console 
port before it can be 
used. The AUX port 
also uses the settings 
of 9600 bps, 8 data 
bits, no parity, 1 stop 
bit, and no ﬂow con-
trol. The speed can be 
set up to 38,400 bps.

Chapter 4: Cable Testing and Cabling LANs and WANs
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■Waves are energy traveling from one place to another and are created by distur-
bances. All waves have similar attributes such as amplitude, period, and frequency.
■Sine waves are periodic, continuously varying functions. Analog signals look like 
sine waves.
■Square waves are periodic functions whose values remain constant for a period 
of time and then change abruptly. Digital signals look like square waves.
■Exponents are used to represent very large numbers. The base of a number raised 
to a particular exponent is equal to the base multiplied by itself exponent times 
(e.g., 103 = 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000).
■Logarithms are similar to exponents. A logarithm to the base of 10 of a number 
equals the exponent to which 10 has to be raised to equal the number (e.g., log10
1000 = 3 because 103 = 1000).
■Decibels are measurements of a gain or loss in the power of a signal. Negative 
values represent losses and positive values represent gains.
■Time-domain analysis is the graphing of voltage or current with respect to time 
using an oscilloscope. Frequency-domain analysis is the graphing of voltage or 
power with respect to frequency using a spectrum analyzer.
■Noise is undesirable signals in communications. Noise originates from other 
cables, RFI, and EMI. White noise affects all frequencies, while narrowband 
interference affects only a certain subset of frequencies.
■Analog bandwidth is the frequency range that is associated with certain analog 
transmission, such as television or FM radio.
■Digital bandwidth measures how much information can ﬂow from one place to 
another in a given amount of time. Its units are in various multiples of bits per 
second.
■It is important to have a basic understanding of these topics in order to under-
stand the cable testing concepts presented in the next lesson.
■The OSI layer at which most of the problems on a LAN occur is the physical 
layer. The only way to prevent or troubleshoot most of these problems is through 
the use of cable testers. Knowledge regarding sources of noise on LAN media is 
important for the proper installation of cable connectors and cabling runs.
■A NIC provides network communication capabilities to and from a PC.
■The three common LAN protocols are Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI.

Summary
243
■The term Ethernet is often used to refer to all CSMA/CD LANs that generally 
conform to the Ethernet speciﬁcations.
■The Ethernet family of LAN implementations includes four main categories: 
Ethernet and IEEE 802.3, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10G or 10000-Mbps 
Ethernet.
■Use a crossover cable to connect between similar devices (like switch to switch, 
router to router, PC to PC, and hub to hub).
■Use a straight-through cable to connect between dissimilar devices (like switch to 
router, switch to PC, hub to router, and hub to PC).
■Two major types of LANs exists, peer-to-peer and client-server.
■WANs use serial data transmission.
■A router is usually the DTE and needs a DTE serial cable to connect to a DCE 
device such as a CSU/DSU.
■The ISDN BRI has two types of interfaces: S/T and U. To interconnect the ISDN 
BRI port to the service-provider device, a UTP CAT 5 straight-through cable is 
used.
■A phone cable and an RJ-11 connector are used to connect a router for DSL service.
■Coaxial cable and an F connector are used to connect a router for cable service.
■Rollover cable is used to connect a terminal and the console port of a router.

Key Terms
active hub
Must be plugged into an electrical outlet because it needs power to 
amplify the incoming signal before passing it out to the other ports.
alien crosstalk
When crosstalk is caused by a signal from outside the cable.
amplitude
 The amplitude of an electrical signal represents its height, but it is 
measured in volts instead of meters.

wire pairs in the cable act like antennas generating a weaker but similar electrical 
signal onto the nearby wire pairs. This crosstalk causes interference with data that 
might be present on the adjacent wires.
decibel
An important way of describing networking signals as a unit that measures 
the loss or gain of the power of a wave. Decibels are usually negative numbers repre-
senting a loss in power as the wave travels, but can also be positive values representing 
a gain in power if the signal is ampliﬁed.
delay skew
The propagation delays of different wire pairs in a single cable can differ 
slightly because of differences in the number of twists and electrical properties of each 
wire pair. Delay skew is the delay difference between pairs.
digital bandwidth
Measures how much information can ﬂow from one place to 
another in a given amount of time.
ELFEXT (equal-level far-end crosstalk)
A test that measures FEXT.
EMI (electromagnetic interference)
Noise from nearby sources such as motors and 
lights.
FEXT (far-end crosstalk)
Crosstalk that occurs when signals on one twisted pair are 
coupled to another pair as they arrive at the far end of a multipair cable system.

generate a certain value.
narrowband interference
Noise that only affects small ranges of frequencies.
NEXT (near-end crosstalk)
Computed as the ratio in voltage amplitude between the

Ethernet Fundamentals
Ethernet, in its various forms, is the most widely used local-area network (LAN) tech-
nology. Ethernet was designed to ﬁll the middle ground between long-distance, low-speed 
networks and specialized, computer-room networks carrying data at high speeds for very 
limited distance.
Ethernet is well suited to applications in which a local communication medium must carry 
sporadic, occasionally heavy trafﬁc at high-pack data rates. It was designed to enable 
sharing resources on a local workgroup level. Design goals include simplicity, low cost, 
compatibility, fairness, low delay, and high speed.
In this chapter, you learn about the history of Ethernet and IEEE Ethernet standards. This 
chapter discusses the operation of Ethernet, Ethernet framing, and error handling, as well 
as the different types of the collisions on Ethernet networks. In addition, this chapter 
introduces collision domains and broadcast domains. Finally, this chapter describes seg-
mentation and the devices used to create network segments.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and Photo-
Zooms that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements 
are designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this 
chapter.
History and Evolution of Ethernet 
LANs are high-speed, low-error data networks that cover a relatively small geographic 
area (up to a few thousand meters). LANs connect workstations, peripherals, terminals, 
and other devices in a single building or other geographically limited area.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Ethernet is the dominant LAN technology in the world. Most of the trafﬁc on the Inter-
net originates and ends with an Ethernet connection. From its beginning in the 1970s, 
Ethernet has evolved to meet the increasing demand for high-speed LANs. When a 
new medium, ﬁber optics, was produced, Ethernet adapted to take advantage of ﬁber’s 
great bandwidth and low error rate. Now the same basic protocol that transported data 
at 3 megabits per second (Mbps) in 1973 is carrying data at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).
Ethernet’s success is a result of its simplicity and ease of maintenance, its capability to 
incorporate new technologies, its reliability, and its low cost of installation and upgrade. 
With the introduction of Gigabit Ethernet, what started as a LAN technology has now 
had its reach extended to distances that make Ethernet a metropolitan-area and even a 
wide-area networking standard. This section provides an overview of the Ethernet, 
including the history of Ethernet, Ethernet naming convention, and Ethernet frame 
formats.
Introduction to Ethernet
The original idea for Ethernet grew out of the problem of allowing two or more users 
to use the same medium without each user’s signals interfering with each other. This 
problem of multiple user access to a shared medium was studied in the early 1970s 
at the University of Hawaii. A system called Alohanet was developed to allow various 
stations on the Hawaiian Islands to each have structured access to the shared radio fre-
quency band in the atmosphere. The original technology that today’s Ethernet is based 
on was wireless. This work later formed the basis for the famous Ethernet MAC method 
known as carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD). CSMA/CD is dis-
cussed in more detail later in this chapter.
The original version of Ethernet was the world’s ﬁrst LAN. It was designed more than 
30 years ago by Robert Metcalfe and his coworkers at Xerox. The ﬁrst Ethernet standard 
was published by a consortium of Digital Equipment Company, Intel, and Xerox (DIX) 
in 1980. Metcalfe wanted Ethernet to be a shared standard from which everyone could 
beneﬁt. Therefore, DIX made the new standard an open standard, meaning that it was 
available to any company. This was not often done in the computer industry. The ﬁrst 
products developed using the Ethernet standard were sold during the early 1980s. Ether-
net products transmitted at 10 Mbps over thick (about the diameter of your smallest 
ﬁnger) coaxial cable up to a distance of 2 km. Ethernet was an instant success.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is a professional organiza-
tion that deﬁnes network standards. In 1985, the IEEE standards committee for local 
and metropolitan networks published its standards for LANs. The IEEE LAN standards 
are the predominant and best-known LAN standards in the world today. These stan-
dards start with the number 802. The standard that was based on Ethernet is standard

802.3. The IEEE wanted to make sure that its standards were compatible with and ﬁt 
into the ISO’s OSI reference model. The IEEE divides the OSI data link layer into two 
separate sublayers: Media Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC).
As a result, some small modiﬁcations to the original Ethernet standard were made in 
the 802.3 standard. Some differences exist between the DIX Ethernet and the 802.3 
speciﬁcations. However, the differences between the two standards are so minor that 
any Ethernet network interface card (NIC) can transmit and receive Ethernet and 802.3 
packets and frames. Essentially, Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 are the same standards. Just 
remember that 802.3 is now the ofﬁcial IEEE Ethernet standard.
During the mid-1980s, Ethernet’s 10-Mbps bandwidth was more than enough for 
the PCs of that era. By the early 1990s, PCs had become much faster and people were 
beginning to complain about the bottleneck caused by the small bandwidth of Ether-
net LANs. In 1995, the IEEE announced a standard for a 100-Mbps Ethernet. This 
was followed by standards for Gigabit (1 billion bits per second) Ethernet in 1998 and 
1999. IEEE approved the standards for 10-Gb Ethernet in June 2002. These more 
modern standards are still Ethernet (802.3). 
All the new Ethernet standards are essentially compatible with the original Ethernet 
standard. An Ethernet packet (a frame) could leave an older 10-Mbps NIC in a PC, 
eventually be placed by a router onto a 10-Gbps Ethernet ﬁber link, and then end up 
at a 100-Mbps Ethernet card. As long as the packet stayed on Ethernet networks, it 
would not be changed. This illustrates one of the main reasons for Ethernet’s great 
success—it is very scalable. That means that the bandwidth of the network could be 
increased again and again without changing the underlying Ethernet technology. 
The original Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) has been supplemented a number of times to incor-
porate new transmission media and to enable higher transmission rates. However, it is 
important to understand that the essential qualities of the original Ethernet have been 
retained. The Ethernet 802.3 standards all belong to the same family. Differences exist 
between the standards, but their similarities are greater than their differences. What 
has been retained from the original in each new standard means that the 802.3 family 
of protocols are all compatible. 
IEEE Ethernet Naming Rules
The term Ethernet refers to a family of networking technologies that include original 
Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet (or Gig-E), and 10-Gb Ethernet (or 10-G). 
These various types of Ethernet are discussed in detail in Chapter 6, “Ethernet Tech-
nologies and Ethernet Switching.”

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Ethernet interfaces can range from US$10 to $100,000. Ethernet speeds can be 10, 
100, 1000, or 10,000 Mbps. This section explores more details of original Ethernet 
(10BASE-T), Fast Ethernet (100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX), Gigabit Ethernet 
(1000BASE-T and 1000BASE-X), and 10-Gb Ethernet. Two features of Ethernet 
remain consistent across all forms of Ethernet: the basic frame format and the IEEE 
sublayers of OSI Layer 2.
When Ethernet needs to be expanded to add a new medium or capability, the IEEE issues 
a new supplement to the 802.3 standard. The new supplements are given a one- or 
two-letter designation—for example, 802.3u is Fast Ethernet. An abbreviated descrip-
tion (called an identiﬁer) also is assigned to the supplement. The following are examples 
of some of the supplements:
■10BASE2 (IEEE 802.3a)
■10BASE5 (IEEE 802.3)
■100BASE-T (IEEE 802.3i)
■1000BASE-TX (IEEE 802.3X)
As you can see, the abbreviated description consists of these parts:
■A number indicating the number of megabits per second transmitted
■The word BASE, indicating that baseband signaling is used
■Numbers (the 2 and 5) that refer to the coaxial cable segment length 
(the 185m length has been rounded up to 2, for 200) 
■One or more letters of the alphabet indicating the type of medium used 
(F = ﬁber optical cable, T = copper unshielded twisted pair)
Baseband signaling is the simplest method of signaling. In baseband signaling, the whole 
bandwidth of the transmission medium is used for the signal. The data signal (a voltage 
on UTP or a ﬂash of light on ﬁber) is transmitted directly over the transmission medium. 
No other special signal (known as a carrier signal) is required. Ethernet uses baseband 
signaling.
A second method of signaling, broadband signaling, is not used in Ethernet. In broad-
band signaling, the data signal is never placed directly on the transmission medium. 
Instead, an analog signal called the carrier signal is modulated by the data signal. Then 
this modulated carrier signal is transmitted. Radio broadcasts and cable TV use broad-
band signaling.

Like the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IEEE is a standards-
making organization. The manufacturers of networking equipment are not required 
to fully comply with all the speciﬁcations of any standard. The goals of IEEE are as 
follows:
■To supply the engineering information necessary to build devices that comply 
with an Ethernet standard
■To not stiﬂe innovation by manufacturers 
If you are setting up or maintaining a small LAN, you can buy all your equipment 
from one reputable manufacturer. Then you can be assured of the compatibility of 
all the devices. However, if you are responsible for a large network made up of many 
smaller Ethernet LANs with equipment from a mix of vendors, your situation is very 
different. The capability to use equipment from a variety of vendors to interoperate 
reliably is a very important issue. It is unfortunate that no industry or governmental 
agency exists to test and certify that a device fully meets an IEEE standard. However, 
that is a very good reason for you to educate yourself about the standards and the 
industry. The fact is, you have only your own knowledge and that of your coworkers 
on which to base your design and purchasing decisions.
IEEE 802.3/Ethernet and the OSI Model
LAN standards deﬁne the physical media and the connectors used to connect devices 
to media at the physical layer of the OSI reference model. LAN standards also deﬁne 
the way devices communicate at the data link layer. In addition, LAN standards deﬁne 
how to encapsulate protocol-speciﬁc trafﬁc in such as way that trafﬁc going to differ-
ent upper-layer protocols can use the same channel that passes though that layers of 
the OSI model. To provide these functions, the IEEE Ethernet data link layer has two 
sublayers:
■Media Access Control (MAC) (802.3)—As the name implies, the MAC sublayer 
deﬁnes how to transmit frames on the physical wire. It handles physical address-
ing associated with each device, network topology deﬁnition, and line discipline. 
■Logical Link Control (LLC) (802.2)—As the name implies, the LLC sublayer is 
responsible for logically identifying different protocol types and then encapsulat-
ing them. A type code or a service access point (SAP) identiﬁer performs the logical 
identiﬁcation. The type of LLC frame used by an end station depends on what 
identiﬁer the upper-layer protocol (such as IP) expects. Although IEEE 802.2
represents one standard type of frame encapsulation, there are others, such as 
Ethernet II (used primarily with TCP/IP–based Ethernet LANS. These are dis-
cussed later in the chapter.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
As shown in Figure 5-1, the IEEE 802.3 standard deﬁnes the physical layer (Layer 1) 
and the MAC portion of the data link layer (Layer 2).
Figure 5-1 802.3 Ethernet and the OSI Model
Figure 5-2 maps a variety of technologies to OSI Layer 1 and the lower half of Layer 2. 
In this book, we focus primarily on Ethernet LAN technology. Layer 1, the physical 
layer, involves interfacing with media, signals, bit streams that travel on media, com-
ponents that put signals on media, and various topologies. The physical layer performs 
a key role in the communication that takes place between computers, but its efforts 
alone are not enough. Each of its functions has its limitations. Layer 2 addresses these 
limitations.

For each limitation in Layer 1, Layer 2 has a solution, as documented in Table 5-1. 
The Layer 2 sublayers, LLC and MAC, are active, vital agreements that make technol-
ogy compatible and computer communication possible. The MAC sublayer is concerned 
with the physical components that will be used to communicate the information. Like 
the other layers, the LLC remains relatively independent of the physical equipment that 
will be used for the communicative process. The LLC allows multiple Layer 3 protocols, 
such as IP and IPX, to be simultaneously supported along with multiple frame types.
Figure 5-3 maps a variety of Ethernet technologies to the lower half of OSI Layer 2, 
and all of Layer 1. Although there are other varieties of Ethernet, the ones depicted are 
the most widely used and are the focus of this course.

mately provides a way for the bits to 
convey meaning.)
Layer 1 cannot decide which computer will 
transmit binary data from a group that is 
all trying to transmit at the same time.
Layer 2 uses the MAC sublayer to

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
MAC Addressing
To allow for local delivery of frames on the Ethernet, there must be an addressing sys-
tem, a way of naming the computers and interfaces. Every computer has a unique way 
of identifying itself. Each computer on a network has a physical address. No two physical 
addresses on a network should ever be alike. Referred to as the Media Access Control 
(MAC) address, the physical address is located on the NIC. Other terms for the MAC 
address include the hardware address, the NIC address, the Layer 2 address, and the 
Ethernet address.
Ethernet uses MAC addresses to uniquely identify individual devices. Every device 
(PC, router, switch) with an Ethernet interface to the LAN must have a MAC address; 
otherwise, other devices cannot communicate with it. A MAC address is 48 bits in 
length and is expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits. The ﬁrst six hexadecimal digits, which 
are administered by the IEEE, identify the manufacturer or vendor and thus comprise 
the organizationally unique identiﬁer (OUI). The remaining six hexadecimal digits 
comprise the interface serial number, or another value administered by the speciﬁc vendor. 
MAC addresses sometimes are referred to as burned-in addresses (BIAs) because they 
are burned into read-only memory (ROM) and are copied into random-access memory 
(RAM) when the NIC initializes. Figure 5-4 illustrates the MAC address format.
Figure 5-4 MAC Address Format
Without MAC addresses, the LAN would be a group of  computers without identiﬁers, 
and it would be impossible to deliver an Ethernet frame. Therefore, at the data link 
layer, a header and a trailer are added to upper-layer data. The header and trailer con-
tain control information intended for the data link layer entity in the destination sys-
tem. Data from upper-layer entities is encapsulated in the data link layer header and 
trailer. 
Ethernet and 802.3 LANs are broadcast networks. All stations see all frames. Each station 
must examine every frame to determine whether that station is the desired destination. 
On an Ethernet network, when one device wants to send data to another device, it can 
open a communication pathway to the other device by using its MAC address. When a

source device sends data out on a network, the data carries the MAC address of its 
intended destination. As this data propagates along the network medium, the NIC in 
each device on the network checks to see if its MAC address matches the physical des-
tination address carried by the data frame. If there is no match, the NIC discards the 
data frame.
If there is a match, the NIC veriﬁes the destination address in the frame header to 
determine whether the packet is properly addressed. When the data passes its destina-
tion station, the NIC for that station makes a copy, takes the data out of the envelope, 
and gives the data to the computer to be processed by upper-layer protocols such as IP 
and TCP. 
Framing in General
Encoded bit streams on physical media represent a tremendous technological accom-
plishment, but they alone are not enough to make communication happen. Framing 
helps obtain essential information that could not otherwise be obtained with coded bit 
streams alone. Examples of such information are listed here: 
■Which computers are communicating with one another 
■When communication between individual computers begins and when it terminates
■Recognition of errors that occur during the communication
■Whose turn it is to “talk” in a computer “conversation” 
■Where the data is located within the frame
When you have a way to identify computers, you can move on to framing. Framing is 
the Layer 2 encapsulation process. A frame is the Layer 2 protocol data unit. Figure 5-5 
illustrates the ideas of bits and frames.
When you work with bits, the most accurate diagram you can use to visualize them is 
a graph showing voltage versus time. However, because you usually deal with larger 
units of data and addressing and control information, this type of graph could become 
ridiculously large and confusing. Another type of diagram you could use is the frame 
format diagram, which is based on voltage versus time graphs. You read them from 
left to right, just like an oscilloscope graph. The frame format diagram shows different 
groupings of bits (ﬁelds); certain functions are associated with the different ﬁelds.

Many different types of frames are described by various standards. A single generic 
frame has sections called ﬁelds, and each ﬁeld is composed of bytes (see Figure 5-6). 
The names of the ﬁelds commonly found in a data link layer frame are as follows: 
■Frame Start ﬁeld 
■Address ﬁeld 
■Length/Type/Control ﬁeld 
■Data ﬁeld 
■Frame Check Sequence (FCS) ﬁeld

Frame Start Field
When computers are connected to a physical medium, there must be a way for them to 
grab the attention of other computers to broadcast the message, as in, “Here comes a 
frame!” Various technologies have different ways of doing this process, but, regardless 
of technology, all frames have a beginning signaling sequence of bytes. 
Address Field
All frames contain identiﬁcation information, such as the address of the source com-
puter (MAC address) and the address  of the destination computer (MAC address). 
Length and Type Fields
Most frames have some specialized ﬁelds. In some technologies, a Length ﬁeld speciﬁes 
the exact length of a frame. Some have a Type ﬁeld, which speciﬁes the Layer 3 proto-
col making the sending request. There is also a set of technologies in which no such 
ﬁelds are used. 
Data Field
The reason for sending frames is to get higher-layer data, ultimately the user applica-
tion data, from the source computer to the destination computer. The data package 
that you want to deliver includes the message that you want to send (the data). Pad-
ding bytes are added sometimes so that the frames have a minimum length. Logical 
Link Control (LLC) bytes also are included with the data ﬁeld in the IEEE standard 
frames. Remember that the LLC sublayer adds control information to the network 
protocol data, a Layer 3 packet, to help deliver that packet to its destination. Layer 2 
communicates with upper layers through LLC.
Frame Check Sequence Field
All frames (and the bits, bytes, and ﬁelds contained within them) are susceptible to 
errors from a variety of sources. The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) ﬁeld contains a 
number based on the data in the frame; this number is calculated by the source com-
puter. When the destination computer receives the frame, it recalculates the FCS num-
ber and compares it with the FCS number included in the frame. If the two numbers 
are different, an error is assumed and the frame is discarded.
The Frame Check Sequence number normally is calculated through the use of a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC), which performs polynomial calculations on the data.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Ethernet Frame Structure
At the MAC sublayer, the frame structure is nearly identical for all speeds of Ethernet 
(10/100/1,000/10,000 Mbps). Half-duplex Gigabit Ethernet 1000BASE-T and the “W” 
versions of 10-Gb Ethernet have certain timing issues that require minor differences in 
how the interframe spacing is handled by the MAC sublayer, but these are otherwise 
the same as the other speeds. However, at the physical layer, almost all versions of 
Ethernet are substantially different from one another, and each speed has its own set 
of architecture design rules.
IEEE 802.3 Ethernet Frame
In addition to the 802.2 frame type discussed previously, there is a simpler IEEE 802.3 
frame type, which was the ﬁrst developed by the IEEE. As with 802.2, however, it is 
not used widely in today’s Ethernet LANs. Figure 5-7 shows the basic IEEE 802.3 
Ethernet frame format.

Ethernet II Frame 
In the DIX version of Ethernet that was developed before the adoption of the IEEE 
802.3 version of Ethernet, the Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) ﬁelds were 
combined into a single ﬁeld, although the binary pattern was identical. The ﬁeld labeled 
Length/Type was listed only as Length in the early IEEE versions and only as Type in 
the DIX version. These two uses of the ﬁeld ofﬁcially were combined in a later IEEE 
version because both uses of the ﬁeld were common throughout the industry. The early 
DIX Ethernet frame format, also know as Ethernet Version2 or Ethernet II, is the most 
commonly used frame type with TCP/IP–based Ethernet LANs. Figure 5-8 illustrates 
the Ethernet II frame format.
Figure 5-8 Ethernet II Frame Format
Table 5-3 lists the octet number and name for each Ethernet II frame ﬁeld.
As indicated in Table 5-3, use of the Ethernet II Type ﬁeld is incorporated into the cur-
rent 802.3 frame deﬁnition. Upon receipt, a station must determine which higher-layer 
protocol is present in an incoming frame. This ﬁrst is attempted by examining the 
Length/Type ﬁeld. If the two-octet value is equal to or greater than 600 hex, the frame 
is interpreted according to the Ethernet II type code indicated. If it is less than 600 hex, 
the frame is interpreted as an 802.3 frame and the length of the frame is indicated. 
Further investigation is required to determine how to proceed. To proceed from here, 
the ﬁrst four octets of the 802.3 Data ﬁeld are examined. The value found in those ﬁrst

is assumed to be an 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer encapsulation and is 
decoded according to the 802.2 LLC encapsulation indicated. One of the two values 
tested for is AAAA in hexadecimal, which indicates an 802.2/802 (Subnetwork Access 
Protocol [SNAP]) encapsulation. The other value tested for is FFFF in hexadecimal, 
which might indicate an old Novell Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) “raw” 
encapsulation.
Ethernet Frame Fields
The following list shows most of the ﬁelds permitted or required in an 802.3 Ethernet 
Frame. Refer back to Figure 5-8 for an illustration of the 802.3 Ethernet frame:
■Preamble—This ﬁeld contains an alternating pattern of 1s and 0s that was used 
for timing synchronization in the asynchronous 10-Mbps and slower implemen-
tations of Ethernet. Faster versions of Ethernet are synchronous, so this timing 
information is redundant but is retained for compatibility. The preamble is seven 
octets in length and is represented by the following binary pattern:

■Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)—This a one-octet ﬁeld that marks the end of the 
timing information. It is represented by the binary pattern 10101011. In the 
early DIX form of Ethernet, this octet was the last in the eight-octet preamble.
Although the old DIX Ethernet described the ﬁrst eight octets differently than the 
IEEE Ethernet, the pattern and usage is identical. Also, the timing information 
represented by the preamble and SFD is discarded and is not counted toward the 
minimum and maximum frame sizes.
■Destination Address—This ﬁeld contains the six-octet MAC destination address. 
The destination address can be a unicast (single node), multicast (group of nodes), 
or broadcast address (all nodes). 
■Source Address—This ﬁeld contains the six-octet MAC source address. The source 
address is supposed to be only the unicast address of the transmitting Ethernet 
station. However, there are an increasing number of virtual protocols in use, which 
use and sometimes share a speciﬁc source MAC address to identify the virtual 
entity.
In the early Ethernet speciﬁcations, MAC addresses were optionally two or six 
octets, as long as the size was constant throughout the broadcast domain. Two-
octet addressing ﬁrst was excluded explicitly in paragraph 3.2.3 in the 1998 version 
of 802.3 and no longer is supported in 802.3 Ethernet.

■Length/Type—If the value is less than 1536 decimal (0600 hexadecimal), value 
indicates Length. The Length interpretation is used where the LLC layer provides 
the protocol identiﬁcation.
— Type (Ethernet)—The Type speciﬁes the upper-layer protocol to receive the 
data after Ethernet processing is complete. 
— Length (IEEE 802.3)—The Length indicates the number of bytes of data 
that follows this ﬁeld. If the value is equal to or greater than 1536 decimal 
(0600 hexadecimal), the value indicates Type, and the contents of the Data 
ﬁeld are decoded per the protocol indicated. A list of common Ethertype 
protocols is found in RFC 1700, beginning around page 168. 
■Data and Pad—This ﬁeld can be of any length that does not cause the frame to 
exceed the maximum frame size. The maximum transmission unit (MTU) for 
Ethernet is 1500 octets, so the data should not exceed that size. The content of 
this ﬁeld is unspeciﬁed. An unspeciﬁed pad is inserted immediately after the user 
data when there is not enough user data for the frame to meet the minimum 
frame length.
The frame structure ﬁgures depict the Data ﬁeld as being between 46 and 1500 
octets. In fact, Ethernet does not specify this. The frame is required to be not less 
than 64 octets or more than 1518 octets, without actually specifying the size of 
the data ﬁeld. This left the user to calculate the size of the data ﬁeld by subtracting 
all the other ﬁelds from the frame size. If the currently required six octet MAC 
addresses are used, the data ﬁeld size will be between 46 (padded, if necessary) 
and 1500 octets.
— Data (IEEE 802.3)—After physical layer and data link layer processing is 
complete, the data is sent to an upper-layer protocol, which must be deﬁned 
within the data portion of the frame. If data in the frame is insufﬁcient 
to ﬁll the frame to its minimum 64-byte size, padding bytes are inserted to 
ensure at least a 64-byte frame. 
■Frame Check Sequence (FCS)—This sequence contains a 4-byte CRC value that 
is created by the sending device and is recalculated by the receiving device to 
check for damaged frames. The mathematical result of a cyclic redundancy check 
(CRC) algorithm is placed in this four-octet ﬁeld. The sending station calculates 
the checksum for the transmitted frame, and the resulting four-octet value is 
appended following the Data/Pad. Receiving station(s) perform the same calcula-
tion and compare the new checksum against the checksum found at the end of 
the transmitted frame. If the two match, the frame is good. The ﬁelds used in the 
calculation include everything from the beginning of the destination address to the 
end of the Data/Pad as shown in Figure 5-7. The preamble, shown in Figure 5-8, 
1102.book  Page 265  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

266
Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
illustrates that SFD and Extension ﬁelds are not included in the calculation. The 
FCS is the only Ethernet ﬁeld transmitted in noncanonical order (MSB ﬁrst).
Because the corruption of a single bit anywhere from the beginning of the desti-
nation address through the end of the FCS ﬁeld causes the checksum to be differ-
ent, the coverage of the FCS includes itself. It is not possible to distinguish between 
corruption of the FCS itself and corruption of any preceding ﬁeld used in the 
calculation.
Ethernet Operation
When multiple stations (nodes) must access physical media and other networking devices, 
various media access control strategies are used. This section brieﬂy reviews the access-
control strategies and focuses on Ethernet access control method—CSMA/CD. 
It should be noted that although CSMA/CD has immense historical importance and 
practical importance in original Ethernet, it is diminishing somewhat in implementa-
tion for two reasons: 
■When four-pair UTP is used, separate wire pairs for transmission (Tx) and recep-
tion (Rx) exist making, copper UTP potentially free from collisions and capable 
of full-duplex operation, depending on whether it is deployed in a shared (hub) 
or switched environment. 
■Similar logic applies to optical ﬁber links, where separate optical paths—a trans-
mission ﬁber and an reception ﬁber—are used. 
One new form of Ethernet—1000BASE-TX, Gigabit Ethernet over copper—uses all 
four wire pairs simultaneously in both directions, resulting in a permanent collision. In 
older forms of Ethernet, such a permanent collision, preclude the system from working. 
Yet in 1000BASE-TX, sophisticated circuitry can accommodate this permanent colli-
sion, resulting from an attempt to get as much data as possible over UTP. 
Media Access Control
Media Access Control (MAC) refers to protocols that determine which computer on a 
shared-medium environment (collision domain) is allowed to transmit the data. MAC, 
with LLC, comprises the IEEE version of Layer 2. MAC and LLC are both sublayers of 
Layer 2. Two broad categories of MAC exist: 
■Deterministic (taking turns) 
■Nondeterministic (ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served) 
Token Ring and FDDI are deterministic, and Ethernet/802.3 is nondeterministic 
(also called probabilistic).

267
Deterministic MAC Protocols
Deterministic MAC protocols use a form of taking turns. Token passing is example 
of the deterministic MAC protocol. Some Native American tribes used the custom of 
passing a “talking stick” during gatherings. Whoever held the talking stick was allowed 
to speak. When that person ﬁnished, he or she passed it to another person. 
In this analogy, the shared medium is the air, the data is the words of the speaker, and 
the protocol is possession of the talking stick. The stick might even be called a token. 
This situation is similar to a data link protocol called a Token Ring. In a Token Ring 
network, individual hosts are arranged in a ring, as shown in Figure 5-9. A special data 
token circulates around the ring. When a host wants to transmit, it seizes the token, 
transmits the data for a limited time, and then places the token back in the ring, where 
it can be passed along, or seized, by another host. 
Figure 5-9 A Token Ring Network
Nondeterministic MAC Protocols
Nondeterministic MAC protocols use a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served (FCFS) approach. 
CSMA/CD is an example of a nondeterministic MAC protocol. 
To use this shared-medium technology, Ethernet allows the networking devices to arbi-
trate for the right to transmit. Stations on a CSMA/CD network listen for quiet, at which 
time it’s okay to transmit. However, if two stations transmit at the same time, a collision
occurs and neither station’s transmission succeeds. All other stations on the network 
also hear the collision and wait for silence. The transmitting stations, in turn, each wait a 
random period of time (a backoff period) before retransmitting, thus minimizing the 
probability of a second collision.

Three Speciﬁc Topological Implementations and Their MACs
Three well-known Layer 2 technologies are Token Ring, FDDI, and Ethernet. Of these, 
Ethernet is by far the most common; however, they all serve to illustrate a different 
approach to LAN requirements. All three specify Layer 2 elements (for example, LLC, 
naming, framing, and MAC), as well as Layer 1 signaling components and media 
issues. The speciﬁc technologies for each are as follows: 
■Ethernet—Logical bus topology (information ﬂow on a linear bus) and physical 
star or extended star (wired as a star)
■Token Ring—Logical ring topology (in other words, information ﬂow controlled 
in a ring) and a physical star topology (in other words, wired as a star) 
■FDDI—Logical ring topology (information ﬂow controlled in a ring) and physical 
dual-ring topology (wired as a dual-ring)
Ethernet MAC
Ethernet is a shared-media broadcast technology. The access method CSMA/CD used 
in Ethernet performs three functions:
■Transmitting and receiving data packets 
■Decoding data packets and checking them for valid addresses before passing 
them to the upper layers of the OSI model 
■Detecting errors within data packets or on the network 
In the CSMA/CD access method, networking devices with data to transmit over the 
networking media work in a listen-before-transmit mode (CS = carrier sense). With 
shared Ethernet, this means that when a device wants to send data, it ﬁrst must check 
to see whether the networking medium is busy. The device must check whether there 
are any signals on the networking media. After the device determines that the network-
ing media is not busy, the device begins to transmit its data. While transmitting its data 
in the form of signals, the device also listens, to ensure that no other stations are trans-
mitting data to the networking medium at the same time. If two stations send data at 
the same time, a collision occurs, as shown in the upper half of Figure 5-10. When it 
completes transmitting its data, the device returns to listening mode. With traditional 
shared Ethernet, only one device can transmit at a time. This is not true with switched 
Ethernet, which is covered in Chapter 6.

Figure 5-10 CSMA/CD
Networking devices are capable of detecting when a collision has occurred because 
the amplitude of the signal on the networking media increases (CD = collision detect). 
When a collision occurs, each device that is transmitting continues to transmit data for 
a short time, to ensure that all devices see the collision. When all devices on the net-
work have seen that a collision has occurred, each transmitting device invokes an algo-
rithm, known as a backoff algorithm. When all transmitting devices on the network 
have backed off for a certain period of time (random and, therefore, different for each 
device), any device can attempt to gain access to the networking media once again. 
When data transmission resumes on the network, the devices that were involved in the 
collision do not have priority to transmit data. Figure 5-11 summarizes the CSMA/CD 
process.

Figure 5-11 CSMA/CD Process
Ethernet is a broadcast transmission technology. This means that all devices on a net-
work can see all frames that pass along the networking medium. However, not all the 
devices on the network will process the data. Only the device whose MAC address
matches the destination MAC address carried by the frame copies the frame into its 
buffer. Ethernet is not concerned with Layer 3 network addresses such as IP or IPX. If 
the MAC addresses match, the frame is copied and passed up to Layer 3 to check the 
destination IP or IPX address for a match.

Ethernet Operation
271
After a device has veriﬁed the destination MAC and IP addresses carried by the data, it 
checks the data packet for errors. If the device detects errors, the data packet is dis-
carded. The destination device does not notify the source device, regardless of whether 
the packet arrived successfully. Ethernet is a connectionless network architecture and 
is referred to as a best-effort delivery system.
Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex Operation
The data channels over which a signal is sent can operate in one of three ways: simplex, 
half duplex, or full duplex. The distinction among these is in the way the signal can 
travel.
Simplex transmission, as its name implies, is simple. It is also called unidirectional 
because the signal travels in only one direction, just like trafﬁc ﬂows on a one-way 
street. Television or radio transmission is an example of simplex communication, as 
illustrated in Figure 5-12.
Figure 5-12 Simplex Transmission
Half-duplex transmission is an improvement over simplex transmission; the trafﬁc can 
travel in both directions. Half-duplex transmission enables signals to travel in either 
direction, but not in both directions simultaneously, as illustrated in Figure 5-13. Half-
duplex Ethernet, deﬁned in the original 802.3 Ethernet, uses only one wire, with a dig-
ital signal running in both directions on the wire. It allows data transmission in only 
on direction at a time between a sending station and a receiving station. It also uses the 
CSMA/CD protocol to help prevent collisions and retransmit if a collision does occur.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Full-duplex transmission, as illustrated in Figure 5-14, operates like a two-way, two-
lane street. Trafﬁc can travel in both directions at the same time. Ethernet full-duplex 
operation is made possible using switch technology, which is covered in greater depth 
in Chapter 6. Full-duplex switched networking technology increases performance 
because data can be sent and received at the same time. Full-duplex Ethernet uses two 
pairs of wires, which allow simultaneous data transmission between a sending station 
and a receiving station. Virtually no collisions occur in full-duplex Ethernet because 
switching technology creates a two-station point-to-point virtual circuit, or “microseg-
ments,” when two devices need to communicate.  Full-duplex Ethernet is supposed to 
offer 100 percent efﬁciency in both directions. This means that you can get 20 Mbps 
with a 10-Mbps Ethernet running in full-duplex operation. A 100-Mbps switch poten-
tially can offer 200 Mbps to a station in full-duplex mode.
Figure 5-14 Full-Duplex Transmission
Ethernet Timing
Ethernet was designed to operate on a bus structure, which is a technical way to say 
that every station always hears all messages at almost the exact same time. The ofﬁcial 
designation is CSMA/CD. CSMA/CD can be interpreted simplistically to mean that 
when two stations realize that they are talking at the same time, they are supposed to 
stop and wait a polite amount of time before trying again.
The basic rules and speciﬁcations for proper operation of Ethernet are not particularly 
complicated, although some of the faster physical layer implementations are becoming 
so. Despite the basic simplicity, when a problem occurs in Ethernet, it is often quite 
difﬁcult to isolate the source of the problem. Because of the common bus architecture 
of Ethernet (which can be described as a distributed single point of failure), the scope 
of the problem is usually all stations within the collision domain that are attached to 
the segment. When repeaters are used, this can include stations up to four segments away. 
According to the rules, any station on an Ethernet network that wants to transmit a 
message ﬁrst listens to ensure that no other station currently is transmitting. If the 
cable is quiet, the station begins transmitting immediately. But because the electrical 
signal takes a small amount of time to travel down the cable (called propagation delay),
and each subsequent repeater encountered introduces a small amount of latency in for-
warding the frame from one port to the next, it is possible for more than one station to 
begin transmitting at or near the same time. A collision then results.

Ethernet Operation
273
If the attached station is operating in full duplex, the station can send and receive 
simultaneously, and collisions should not be present. Full-duplex operation also changes 
the timing considerations and eliminates the concept of slot time. Full-duplex operation 
allows for larger network architecture designs because the timing restriction for collision 
detection is removed.
In half-duplex operation, assuming that a collision does not occur, the sending station 
transmits 64 bits of timing synchronization information that often is known collectively 
as the preamble. The contents are as follows: 
■Destination and source MAC addressing information
■Certain other header information
■The actual data payload
■A checksum (FCS) used to ensure that the message was not corrupted along 
the way
Stations receiving the frame recalculate the FCS to determine whether the incoming 
message is valid, and hand good messages to the next higher layer in the protocol 
stack.
For 10-Mbps Ethernet and slower versions, which are asynchronous, each receiving 
station uses the eight octets of timing information to synchronize its receive circuit to 
the incoming data but then discard it. The 100 Mbps higher-speed implementations of 
Ethernet are synchronous, so the timing information is not actually required at all. 
However, for compatibility reasons, the preamble and SFD are present. All information 
following the SFD at the end of the timing information is passed to the next higher 
layer. A new checksum is calculated and compared with the checksum found at the end 
of the received frame. If the frame is intact, it then must be interpreted according to the 
rules for whichever protocol is indicated by the Length/Type ﬁeld or the LLC-layer 
protocol indicated by the ﬁrst few octets of the data.
A notable number of changes to the basic structure of Ethernet were included in the 
1998 and 2000 versions of the standard. One signiﬁcant change was that two-octet 
addresses explicitly were excluded, although they were included in all previous versions. 
When used for Length, the maximum value for the 802.3 Length/Type ﬁeld clearly was 
speciﬁed as 1536 (600 hex), where it previously was assumed to match the maximum 
MTU data size of 1500 (5DC hex).
For all speeds of Ethernet transmission at or below 1000 Mbps, the standard describes 
how a transmission can be no smaller than slot time. Slot time for 10 and 100 Mbps 
Ethernet is 512 bit-times (64 octets). Slot time for 1000 Mbps Ethernet is 4096 bit-times 
(512 octets, including the extension). Slot time is not deﬁned for 10 Gbps Ethernet 
because it does not permit half-duplex operation. Slot time is just longer than the longest

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
possible round-trip delay time when maximum cable lengths are used on the largest 
legal network architecture and all hardware propagation delay times are at the legal 
maximum; the 32-bit jam signal is used when collisions are detected. In other words, 
slot time is just longer than the time it theoretically can take to go from one extreme 
end of the largest legal Ethernet collision domain to the other extreme end, collide 
with another transmission at the last possible instant, and then have the collision frag-
ments return to the sending station and be detected. For the system to work, the ﬁrst 
station must learn about the collision before it ﬁnishes sending the smallest legal frame 
size. To allow 1000 Mbps Ethernet to operate in half duplex, the Extension ﬁeld was 
added when sending small frames, purely to keep the transmitter busy long enough 
for a collision fragment to make it back. This ﬁeld is present only on 1000 Mbps half-
duplex links, and it allows minimum-size 64-octet frames to be stretched long enough 
to meet slot-time requirements. Extension bits are discarded by the receiving station.
To examine the issue brieﬂy, consider the following: On a 10 Mbps Ethernet, 1 bit at 
the MAC sublayer requires 100 nanoseconds (ns) to transmit. At 100 Mbps, that same 
bit requires 10 ns to transmit, and at 1000 Mbps, it takes only 1 ns. Table 5-4 summa-
rizes the bit-time of different types of Ethernet.
As a rough estimate, 8 inches (20.3 cm) per nanosecond often is used for calculating 
propagation delay down a UTP cable. For 100m of UTP, this means that it takes just 
under 5 bit-times for a 10BASE-T signal to travel the length of a 100m cable (about 
4.92 bit-times). Simply moving the decimal point over results in 49.2 bit-times at 
100 Mbps, and 492 bit-times at 1000 Mbps. 
For CSMA/CD Ethernet to operate, the sending station must become aware of a colli-
sion before it has completed transmission of a minimum-size frame. At 100 Mbps, the 
system timing is barely capable of accommodating 100m cables. At 1000 Mbps, special 
(very inefﬁcient) adjustments were required because nearly an entire minimum-size frame 
has been transmitted before the ﬁrst bit reaches the end of the ﬁrst 100 meters of UTP 
cable. It is easy to see why half duplex was not permitted in 10-Gb Ethernet.

Interframe Spacing and Backoff
Table 5-5 shows the minimum spacing between two noncolliding packets, also called 
the interframe spacing, from the last bit of the FCS ﬁeld of the ﬁrst frame to the ﬁrst 
bit of the preamble of the second frame. 
After a frame has been sent, all stations on a 10-Mbps Ethernet are required to wait a 
minimum of 96 bit-times (9.6 microseconds) before any station legally can transmit 
the next frame. On faster versions of Ethernet, the spacing remains the same: 96 bit-
times. However, the time required for that interval grows correspondingly shorter, as 
shown in Table 5-6. This interval alternately is referred to as the interframe spacing, 
the interframe gap, and the interpacket gap, and it is intended to allow slow stations 
time to process the previous frame and prepare for the next frame.
However, a repeater is expected to regenerate the full 64 bits of timing information 
(preamble and SFD) at the start of any frame, despite the potential loss of some of the 
beginning preamble bits to slow synchronization. Thus, because of this forced reintro-
duction of timing bits, some minor reduction of the interframe gap is not only possible, 
but expected. Some Ethernet chip sets are sensitive to a shortening of the interframe

spacing and begin failing to see frames as the gap is reduced. With the increase in pro-
cessing power at the desktop, it would be very easy for a personal computer to saturate 
an Ethernet segment with trafﬁc and to begin transmitting again before the interframe 
spacing delay time is satisﬁed. Over the years, some vendors deliberately have violated 
the interframe gap a little to improve throughput testing results in competitive product 
comparisons. For the most part, this cheating on the interframe spacing has not caused 
problems, but it has the potential to do so.
After a collision occurs and all stations allow the cable to become idle (each waits the 
full interframe spacing), the stations that collided must wait an additional—and poten-
tially progressively longer—period of time before attempting to retransmit the collided 
frame. The waiting period intentionally is designed to be semi-random so that two sta-
tions do not delay for the same amount of time before retransmitting; otherwise, the 
result would be more collisions. This is accomplished in part by expanding the interval 
from which the random retransmission time is selected on each retransmission attempt. 
The waiting period is measured in increments of the parameter slot time.
Retransmission is controlled by this formula: 
0 = r < 2k 
Here, r is some random number of slot times and k is the number of backoff attempts 
(up to a maximum of 10 for the backoff value). Backoff time is deﬁned as follows: 
r * slot time
The total maximum number of retransmission attempts is 16, although the backoff 
value remains at 10 for the last few attempts. The formula speciﬁes the minimum wait-
ing period for a retransmission attempt. It is quite acceptable, though not necessarily 
desirable, for a station to introduce extra delays that will degrade its own throughput.
As an example, after the ﬁfth consecutive collision without being able to transmit the 
current 10BASE-T frame, the waiting time would be a random delay interval between 
0 and 32 slot times (0 = r < 25). Restated, the delay would be a random number of 
51.2 microsecond time units, ranging from an immediate retry attempt up to 1638.4 
microseconds later.
If the MAC sublayer still cannot send the frame after 16 attempts, it gives up and 
generates an error to the next layer up. Such an occurrence is fairly rare and happens 
only under extremely heavy network loads or when a physical problem exists on the 
network.
In a special situation, the MAC sublayer experiences much more frequent failures to 
send a frame despite the 16 attempts, usually found on switched links. This is called

the capture effect or the packet starvation effect. When two devices (switches, stations, 
or both) connect in half-duplex operation and each is attempting to send a large block 
of trafﬁc, a collision will certainly occur. Whichever station “wins” the ﬁrst retransmission 
has a progressively greater chance to transmit with each subsequent collision. Assume 
that a second collision has taken place. The ﬁrst station, which was capable of trans-
mitting its ﬁrst frame, again selects its random delay between 0 and 1 time intervals, 
while the second station now selects from 0, 1, 2, and 3 time intervals. It is highly likely 
that the ﬁrst station will again select a shorter delay time and be capable of transmit-
ting. The ﬁrst station will probably win the retransmission for 16 consecutive attempts 
by the second station. The second station then will give up and discard that frame. It 
also will record an excessive collisions error. This type of error usually is revealed using 
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to query a switch port, and it often 
is found even where only a single device is attached to the affected port. Because Ethernet 
is inherently bursty, this might be reported on ports with relatively low average utilization.
Error Handling
The most common (and usually benign) error condition on an Ethernet is the collision. 
Collisions are the mechanism for resolving contention for network access. A few colli-
sions provide a smooth, simple, low-overhead way for network nodes to arbitrate con-
tention for the network resource. When the network cannot operate properly because 
of various problems, collisions can become a signiﬁcant impediment to useful network 
operation. Collisions are possible only on half-duplex segments.
Collisions waste time in two ways: First, network bandwidth loss is equal to the initial 
transmission and the collision jam signal. This is called consumption delay, and it affects 
all network nodes. Consumption delay signiﬁcantly can reduce network throughput. 
Following each successful or failed transmission attempt is an enforced idle time 
(backoff period) for all stations, called the interframe spacing (or interframe gap), that 
further impacts throughput. The second type of delay is a result of this collision back-
off algorithm. Backoff delays are not usually signiﬁcant. 
The considerable majority of collisions occur very early in the frame, often before the 
SFD. Collisions occurring before the SFD usually are not reported to the higher layers, 
as if the collision did not occur. As soon as a collision is detected, the sending station(s) 
transmit a 32-bit jam signal that will enforce the collision. This is done so that any 
data being transmitted thoroughly is corrupted and all stations have a chance to detect 
the collision. 
In Figure 5-15, two stations are listening to ensure that the cable is idle and then trans-
mit. The 802.3 standard provides worst-case limits on how long each component in 
the system can delay a signal. The maximum allowed round-trip delay for a 10-Mbps

collision domain is 512 bit-times, a value that determines the minimum frame size. 
Station 1 is the ﬁrst station transmitting, so that station sends the most data before a 
collision is detected. Station 2 is capable of sending only a few bits before the collision 
is detected.
Figure 5-15 Routine Error Handling in a 10-Mbps Collision Domain
Examine Figure 5-15 closely. Station 1 can transmit a signiﬁcant percentage of the 
frame before the signal even reaches the last cable segment. Station 2 does not receive 
the ﬁrst bit of the transmission before beginning its own transmission. Station 2 can 
send only several bits before the NIC senses the collision. Station 2 immediately trun-
cates the current transmission and substitutes the 32-bit jam signal in its place. Then 
Station 2 ceases all transmissions. During the collision and jam event that Station 2 is 
experiencing, the collision fragments work their way back through the repeated collision 
domain toward Station 1. Station 2 completes transmission of the 32-bit jam signal 
and becomes silent before the collision can propagate back to Station 1. Station 1, still 
unaware of the collision, continues to transmit. When the collision fragments ﬁnally

reach Station 1, it also truncates the current transmission and substitutes a 32-bit jam 
signal in place of the remainder of the frame being transmitted. Upon sending the 32-bit 
jam signal, Station 1 ceases all transmissions.
A jam signal can be composed of any binary data, as long as it does not form a proper 
checksum for the portion of the frame already transmitted. The most commonly observed 
data pattern for a jam signal is simply a repeating 1, 0, 1, 0 pattern, the same as the 
preamble. When viewed by a protocol analyzer, this pattern appears as a repeating 
hexadecimal 5 or A sequence. The corrupted, partially transmitted messages often are 
referred to as collision fragments and sometimes by the slang term runts. Compared 
to late collisions, normal collisions are less than 64 octets in length and, therefore, fail 
both the minimum length test and the FCS checksum test.
Types of Collisions
Collisions typically take place when two or more Ethernet stations transmit simulta-
neously within a collision domain. Collisions are reported by event counts by most 
diagnostic tools, but they might be reported separately as single collisions or multiple 
collisions when a switch or other station is queried with SNMP. A single collision refers 
to a collision that was detected while trying to transmit a frame, but, on the next 
attempt, the frame was transmitted successfully. Multiple collisions indicate that the 
same frame collided repeatedly before being successfully transmitted. This is different 
from frames with deferred transmissions because the deferred transmission frame did 
not collide. The medium was busy when the station or switch sought to transmit, and 
it was required to wait its turn to transmit. Because of repeated collisions of the same 
frame, the frame might not be transmitted at all, which would be reported as being 
aborted as the result of excessive collisions.
The results of collisions—partial and corrupted frames that are less than 64 octets and 
that have an invalid FCS—often are called collision fragments. Some protocol analyzers 
and network monitors call these fragments runts, but the term is imprecise. 
The main Ethernet frame error types that can be captured through a protocol-analysis 
session are local collision, remote collision, and late collision. Figure 5-16 illustrates 
those collision types. The sections that follow brieﬂy describe each frame error type.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Local Collision
To create a local collision on coax cable (10BASE2 and 10BASE5), the signal travels 
down the single cable until it encounters a signal from the other station. The waveforms 
then overlap, canceling out some parts of the signal and reinforcing (doubling) other 
parts. The doubling of the signal pushes the voltage level of the signal beyond the 
allowed maximum. This overvoltage condition is sensed by all of the stations on the 
local cable segment as a collision. A special circuit in the NIC monitors for this over-
voltage condition. The overvoltage threshold is around –1.5 volts, as measured on the 
coax cable. Figure 5-17 shows a midframe in 10BASE2/10BASE5 collision captured by 
a digital storage oscilloscope.
Figure 5-17 10BASE2/10BASE5 Local Collision
In Figure 5-17, the beginning of the waveform represents normal Manchester-encoded 
data. A few cycles into the sample, the amplitude of the wave doubles. That is the 
beginning of the collision, where the two waveforms overlap. Just before the end of the 
sample, the amplitude returns to normal when the ﬁrst station to detect the collision 
quit transmitting, and a jam from the second colliding station still is observed.
On UTP cable (such as 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, and 1000BASE-T), a collision is 
detected on the local segment only when a station detects a signal on the RX (receive) 
pair at the same time it is sending on the TX (transmit) pair. Because the two signals 
are on different pairs, there is no characteristic change in the signal, as shown in Fig-
ure 5-17. Collisions are recognized on UTP only when the station is operating in half 
duplex. The only functional difference between half- and full-duplex operation in this 
regard is whether both transmit and receive pairs are permitted to be used simulta-
neously. If the station is not engaged in transmitting, it cannot detect a local collision. 
1102.book  Page 280  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

281
Conversely, a cable fault, such as excessive crosstalk, can cause a station to perceive its 
own transmission as a local collision.
Remote Collision
The characteristics of a remote collision are a frame that is less than the minimum 
length has an invalid FCS checksum, but does not exhibit the local collision symptom 
of overvoltage or simultaneous RX/TX activity. This sort of collision usually results 
from collisions that occur on the far side of a repeated connection. A repeater will not 
forward an overvoltage state and cannot cause a station to have both the TX and RX 
pairs active at the same time. The station would have to be transmitting to have both 
pairs active, and that would constitute a local collision. On UTP networks, this is the 
most common sort of collision observed. Nearly all monitoring tools that report colli-
sions, such as software protocol analyzers and Remote Monitoring (RMON) probes, 
will detect only remote collisions because they are passive listening devices.
Late Collision
No possibility exists for a normal or legal collision after the ﬁrst 64 octets of data have 
been transmitted by the sending station(s). The theoretical maximums for legal net-
work propagation times are exceeded before then. Collisions that occur after the ﬁrst 
64 octets are called late collisions. The most signiﬁcant difference between late collisions 
and collisions that occur before the ﬁrst 64 octets is that the Ethernet NIC retransmits 
a normally collided frame automatically but does not automatically retransmit a frame 
that collided late. As far as the NIC is concerned, everything went out ﬁne, and the 
upper layers of the protocol stack must deduce that the frame was lost. Other than 
retransmission, a station that detects a late collision handles it in exactly the same way 
as a normal collision.
In all but one case, the 802.3 standard permits a station to attempt to retransmit a 
frame that collided late, but it does not require this. Gigabit Ethernet explicitly denies 
late-collided frames from being retransmitted. 
A late remote collision takes place after slot time has elapsed and on the far side of a 
repeater. However, because the repeater would prevent observation of the local collision 
symptoms of an overvoltage state or simultaneous receive/transmit event, monitoring 
hardware would have to be present on the distant segment to detect a late collision and 
report that information to the monitoring station. You also can infer that a late remote 
collision took place somewhere on the other side of a repeater by analyzing the last 
few octets of a bad frame for the presence of the pattern normally associated with a 
jam signal. Typically, this type of collision would be detected on the local segment simply 
as an FCS error.

Ethernet Errors
Why learn about Ethernet errors? Because Ethernet is a dominant LAN technology, an 
intimate knowledge of typical errors is invaluable for understanding both the operation 
and troubleshooting of Ethernets.
Whereas local and remote collisions are considered to be a normal part of Ethernet 
operation, the late collision is considered to be an error. The presence of errors on 
Ethernet always suggests that further investigation is warranted. The severity of the 
problem indicates the troubleshooting urgency related to the detected error(s). A 
handful of errors detected over many minutes or over hours would be a low priority. 
Thousands detected over a few minutes suggest that urgent attention is warranted. 
Situations that are considered Ethernet errors are as follows: 
■Simultaneous transmission occurring before the slot time has elapsed 
(collision or runt)
■Simultaneous transmission occurring after the slot time has elapsed 
(late collision)
■Excessively or illegally long transmission (jabber, long frame, and range errors)
■Illegally short transmission (short frame, collision fragment, or runt)
■Corrupted transmission (FCS error)
■Insufﬁcient or excessive number of bits transmitted (alignment error)
■Mismatch of actual and reported number of octets in frame (range error)
■Unusually long preamble or jam event (ghost or jabber) 
Each situation is deﬁned separately. Frames associated with error conditions are fre-
quently, but not always, discarded. Normal collisions are included simply to provide 
a more complete list but are not actually considered errors. The sections that follow 
brieﬂy describe some of the Ethernet errors. 
Jabber
Jabber is deﬁned several places in the 802.3 standard as being a transmission of at least 
20,000 to 50,000 bit-times in duration. However, most diagnostic tools report jabber 
whenever a detected transmission exceeds the maximum legal frame size—which is 
considerably smaller than 20,000 to 50,000 bit-times. This presents a rather fuzzy 
deﬁnition because the reporting device might or might not consider a 1518-octet frame 
with VLAN tagging added to be larger than the legal limit. Also, no indication exists 
as to whether jabber has a good or bad FCS. Most references to jabber more properly 
are called long frames.
1102.book  Page 282  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Ethernet Operation
283
Long Frame
A long frame is one that is longer than the maximum legal size and that takes into 
consideration whether the frame was tagged. It does not consider whether the frame 
had a valid FCS checksum. This error usually is meant when someone says that jabber 
was detected on the network. Figure 5-18 illustrates that a long frame is longer than 
1518 octets.
Figure 5-18 Long Frame 
Jabber and long frames are both in excess of the maximum frame size. Jabber is signif-
icantly larger, however. If the frame is 802.1q tagged, that usually is not counted 
toward being illegally large. The IEEE 802.1Q standard deﬁnes the operation of virtual 
LAN (VLAN) bridges that permit the deﬁnition, operation, and administration of VLAN 
topologies within a bridged LAN infrastructure. The IEEE’s 802.1Q standard was 
developed to address the problem of how to break large networks into smaller parts so 
that broadcast and multicast trafﬁc would not grab more bandwidth than necessary.
Short Frame
A short frame is a frame smaller than the minimum legal size of 64 octets, with a good 
frame check sequence. Some protocol analyzers and network monitors call these frames 
runts, but the term is imprecise. In general, you should not see short frames, although 
their presence is no guarantee that the network is failing. 
Short frames are formed properly in all but one aspect and have valid FCS checksums; 
they are less than the minimum frame size (64 octets), however. Figure 5-19 illustrates 
that a short frame is shorter than 64 octets.
Figure 5-19 Short Frame
Runt
The term runt is generally an imprecise slang term that means something less than a 
legal frame size. It can refer to short frames with a valid FCS checksums. It usually

refers to collision fragments. The Ethernet standard describes an SNMP management 
attribute called a runt that is approximately greater than 74 bit-times but less than the 
minimum frame size (64 octets at 10-/100-Mbps speeds, or the minimum half-duplex 
transmission event of 517 octets at 1000 Mbps); is not a local collision. 
FCS Errors
A received frame with a bad frame check sequence (also referred to as a checksum or 
CRC error) is different by at least 1 bit from what was transmitted. In a frame with an 
FCS error, the header information is probably correct (the addressing and such), but 
the checksum calculated by the receiving station does not match the checksum appended 
to the end of the frame by the sending station. Trusting the accuracy of the addressing 
in a single frame is probably a bad idea, but if many frames have the same source 
address, there is a pretty good chance that the source address is correct.
A high number of FCS errors from a single station usually indicates a faulty NIC or 
faulty or corrupted software drivers, or a bad cable connecting that station to the net-
work. If FCS errors are associated with many stations, it generally is traceable to bad 
cabling, a faulty version of a NIC driver, a faulty hub port, or induced noise in the 
cable system.
FCS errors are reported when at least 1 bit in the transmission is different. When a 
new checksum is calculated by the receiving station and compared to the checksum in 
the FCS ﬁeld, the two do not match. The frame then is discarded. 
Alignment Error
A message that does not end on an octet boundary is known as an alignment error.
That is, instead of the correct number of binary bits to form complete octet groupings, 
some additional bits (less than 8) are left over. Such a frame is truncated to the nearest 
octet boundary; if the FCS checksum fails, an alignment error is reported. This often is 
caused by bad software drivers or a collision, and frequently is accompanied by a fail-
ure of the FCS checksum. Other causes are characterized by a read and write operation 
error, which is caused by software bugs. If an alignment error is not corrected, this can 
cause a crash. Usually, the software corrects itself, but this causes a sudden spike in 
CPU resources for the router.
Range Error
A frame that has a legal-size value in the Length ﬁeld but that does not match the 
actual number of octets counted in the Data ﬁeld of the received frame is known as 
a range error. This error also appears when the Length ﬁeld value is less than the 
1102.book  Page 284  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Ethernet Operation
285
minimum legal unpadded size of the Data ﬁeld. A similar error, Out of Range, is 
reported when the value in the Length ﬁeld indicates a data size that is too large to 
be legal.
Ghost
Fluke Networks has coined the term ghost to mean energy (noise) detected on the cable 
that appears to be a frame but that lacks a valid SFD. To qualify as a ghost, this “frame” 
must be at least 72 octets long (including the preamble); otherwise, it is classiﬁed as a 
remote collision. Because of the peculiar nature of ghosts, it is important to note that 
test results largely are dependent upon where on the segment the measurement is made.
Some types of noise fool nodes on a network segment into thinking they are receiving 
a frame. However, the sensed frame never comes, so no data is passed up into the NIC 
to be processed. After a while, the sensed transmission ceases and the NIC resumes 
sending its own messages. Different network interfaces react differently, and no stan-
dards deﬁne how or when an NIC should react to a noisy segment. Repeaters usually 
propagate these noise signals into other segments of the collision domain.
The visible symptom of ghosting is a network that is slow for no apparent reason. The 
ﬁle servers are nearly idle, and network-monitoring equipment shows very low network 
utilization, yet users complain that the network is excessively slow or completely down. 
The symptom might be geographically limited, with one end of a large/long segment 
seeming to operate and the other being slow or completely down.
Ground loops and other wiring problems are usually the cause of ghosting. Ghosts 
cause some repeaters to respond as though a frame is being received. Because the 
repeater reacts only to an AC voltage riding on the cable, there is no valid frame to 
pass on to the other ports. The repeater, however, transmits this energy on to its other 
port(s). The retransmitted ghost might appear as a jam pattern or a very long preamble.
Most network-monitoring tools do not recognize the existence of ghosts, for the same 
reason that they do not recognize preamble collisions—they rely entirely on what the 
chip set tells them. Software-only protocol analyzers, many hardware-based protocol 
analyzers and hand-held diagnostic tools, and as most RMON probes do not report 
these events.
Ethernet Autonegotiation
As Ethernet grew from 10 to 100 and 1000 Mbps, one goal was to make each technol-
ogy interoperable, even to the point that 10, 100, and 1000 interfaces could be directly 
connected. A process called autonegotiation (of speeds and half duplex or full duplex) 
was developed. Speciﬁcally, at the time that Fast Ethernet was introduced, the standard 
1102.book  Page 285  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

286
Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
included a method of automatically conﬁguring a given interface to match the speed 
and capabilities of the link partner. This process deﬁnes how two link partners auto-
matically can negotiate a conﬁguration that offers the best common performance level. 
It has the additional advantage of involving only the lowest part of the physical layer.
10BASE-T required each station to transmit a link pulse about every 16 milliseconds 
whenever the station was not engaged in transmitting a message. Autonegotiation 
adopted this signal and renamed it a Normal Link Pulse (NLP). When a series of NLPs 
are sent in a group for the purpose of autonegotiation, the group is called a Fast Link 
Pulse (FLP) burst. Each FLP burst is sent at the same timing interval as an NLP and is 
intended to allow older 10BASE-T devices to operate normally if they receive an FLP 
burst. Figure 5-20 illustrates the NLP and FLP timing.
Figure 5-20 NLP Versus FLP Timing
10BASE-T transmits using signaling between +1 and –1 volts, for a 2-volt peak-to-
peak differential signal. NLP signaling uses only the range from 0 to +1 volts. The 
duration of a single NLP pulse is 100 ns. Figure 5-21 illustrates two sample NLP pulses. 
The left pulse is very sharp and clean, and is from an interface capable of 1000-Mbps 
operation. The right pulse is from an older device capable of only 10/100-Mbps opera-
tion, which does not require as precise of a signal.
Figure 5-21 NLP Pulses
Autonegotiation is accomplished by transmitting a burst of 10BASE-T link pulses from 
each of the two link partners. The burst communicates the capabilities of the trans-
mitting station to its link partner. After both stations have interpreted what the other

partner is offering, both switch to the highest-performance common conﬁguration and 
establish link at that speed. If anything interrupts communications and the link is lost, 
the two link partners ﬁrst attempt to link again at the last negotiated speed. If that fails, 
or if it has been too long since the link was lost, the autonegotiation process starts over. 
The link can be lost because of external inﬂuences, such as a cable fault, or because 
one of the partners issues a reset.
Figure 5-22 shows the actual FLP autonegotiation burst. The FLP burst is made up of 
multiple NLP link pulses.
Figure 5-22 FLP Autonegotiation Burst
An FLP burst consists of 33 pulse positions, which represent a 16-bit link code word 
that is framed by 17 clocking pulses. Pulses within a burst are separated by 62.5 ms 
(±7 ms). Data pulse positions are found between each clocking pulse. If a data pulse is 
present, it is interpreted as a binary 1. The absence of a data pulse in the window 
between two clocking pulses is interpreted as a binary 0. As shown in Figure 5-23, the 
17 clocking pulses are always present. The 16 data pulses are present only if they rep-
resent binary 1; they are absent if they represent binary 0 in the encoded 16-bit data 
word. The pulses interpreted as binary 1s for data are highlighted in gray.
Figure 5-23 Interpretation of Autonegotiation Pulse
When autonegotiation is implemented, additional information can be added using the 
concept of pages. Pages are additional bits representing more sophisticated negotiation 
and link parameters.
After a device has decoded the link code word offered by its link partner, it acknowledges 
receipt of the current word by sending at least three FLP bursts with the Acknowledge 
bit set. After both link partners acknowledge the current FLP link code word exchange 
in that manner, the link partners either move on to the next page or enable the agreed

conﬁguration and attempt to link accordingly. Link partners can send any number of 
next pages following the initial conﬁguration base page and any necessary next pages 
that are associated with the base page.
Link Establishment and Full/Half Duplex
Link partners are allowed to skip offering conﬁgurations that they are capable of offer-
ing, but are not allowed to include conﬁgurations that they are not capable of offering. 
This enables the network administrator to force ports to a selected speed and duplex 
setting, without disabling autonegotiation.
Autonegotiation is optional for most Ethernet implementations. Gigabit Ethernet 
requires its implementation, although the user can disable it. Autonegotiation origi-
nally was deﬁned for UTP implementations of Ethernet. It has been extended to work 
with other ﬁber-optic implementations through the use of /C/ ordered sets in the place 
of the FLP bursts.
When an autonegotiating station ﬁrst attempts to link, it is supposed to enable 10BASET 
parts of the front-end chip set to attempt to immediately establish a link. If 10BASET sig-
naling is present and the station supports 10BASET, it attempts to establish a link with-
out negotiating. If either signaling produces a link, or if FLP bursts are received, the 
station proceeds with that technology. If a link partner does not offer an FLP burst, but
instead offers NLPs, that device automatically is assumed to be a 10BASET station. Dur-
ing this initial interval of testing for other technologies, the transmit path sends FLP 
bursts. The standard does not permit parallel detection of any other technologies.
If a link is established through parallel detection, it is required to be half duplex. Only 
two methods of achieving a full-duplex link exist: 
■Through a completed cycle of autonegotiation 
■By administratively forcing both link partners to full duplex 
If one link partner is forced to full duplex but the other partner parallel-detects while 
attempting to autonegotiate, there is certain to be a duplex mismatch, resulting in col-
lisions and errors on that link. If you force one end, you must force the other. The 
exception to this is that 10 Gigabit Ethernet does not support half duplex.
Many vendors implement their hardware in such a way that it cycles through the various 
possible states. It transmits FLP bursts to autonegotiate for a while, then it conﬁgures 
itself for Fast Ethernet and attempts to link for a while, and ﬁnally it simply listens for 
a while. Some vendors do not offer any transmitted attempt to link until the interface

ﬁrst hears an FLP burst or some other signaling scheme. In the silent listening state, a 
portable computer is capable of conserving enough battery power to be quite worth-
while, although this mode is not supported by the standard.
Ethernet Duplex Operation
Two duplex modes exist: half and full. For shared media, the half-duplex mode is man-
datory. All of the coaxial implementations are inherently half duplex in nature and 
cannot operate in full duplex. UTP and ﬁber implementations can be operated in half 
duplex, but that mode is an administrative imposition. All 10-Gbps implementations 
are speciﬁed for full duplex only.
In half duplex, only one station can transmit at a time. For the coaxial implementations, 
a second station transmitting causes the signals to overlap and collide, becoming cor-
rupted. Because UTP and ﬁber generally transmit on separate pairs, the signals have no 
opportunity to overlap and become corrupted. Ethernet has established arbitration 
rules for resolving conﬂicts that arise when more than one station attempts to transmit 
at the same time. Both stations in a point-to-point full-duplex link are permitted to 
transmit at any time, regardless of whether the other station is transmitting at the same 
time.
Autonegotiation avoids most situations in which one station in a point-to-point link 
is transmitting under half-duplex rules and the other is operating under full-duplex 
rules. Only two methods exist of achieving a full-duplex connection at speeds below 
10 Gigabit Ethernet: 
■By using autonegotiation 
■By administratively forcing the interface mode 
If one station in a point-to-point link is autonegotiating and the other is not, the auto-
negotiating station is required to select half duplex. Thus, if one end of a link is forced, 
it is incumbent upon the network support staff to force the other end as well. Failure 
to force both ends results in an artiﬁcially elevated error level and poor performance 
on the link. Duplex mismatches are perhaps the most common problem found on 
switched networks.
Priority Resolution
In the anticipated event that link partners share more than one common technology 
capability, the following list is used to determine which technology should be chosen 
from the offered conﬁgurations. In other words, it is desirable for 10-/100-/1000-Mbps

versions of copper-based Ethernet to agree automatically on the best way for two inter-
faces to link. The list is ranked by priority, with the most desirable link conﬁguration 
at the top:
■Full duplex
■Half duplex
■Full duplex
■Half duplex
■Hull duplex
■Half duplex
Fiber-optic Ethernet implementations are not included in this priority resolution list 
because the interface electronics and optics do not permit easy reconﬁguration between 
implementations. It is assumed that the interface conﬁguration is ﬁxed. If the two 
interfaces are capable of autonegotiating, they are already using the same Ethernet 
implementation, although there remain a number of conﬁguration choices, such as the 
duplex setting or which station will act as the master for clocking purposes.
Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains
This section presents topics that relate to collision and broadcast domains. Excessive 
broadcasts and collisions can affect the network performance. This section discusses 
how to reduce the impact of broadcasts and collisions on the performance of the net-
work. The term segment is deﬁned, and different types of segmentation are discussed. 
Directly Connected Networks 
To understand collision domains, it is ﬁrst necessary to examine the issues of what a 
collision is and how it is caused. To help explain collisions, it is useful to review Layer 1 
media and topologies. 
As illustrated in Figure 5-24, some of the various types of directly connected networks 
include the following:
■Shared-media environment—A shared-media environment occurs when multiple 
hosts have access to the same medium. For example, if several PCs are attached 
to the same physical wire or optical ﬁber, or share the same airspace, they all 
share the same media environment. In this case, they are said to share the same 
collision domain. Traditional bus-based (coaxial cable) Ethernet and hub-based 
Ethernet (UTP cable) are shared-media environments. 
1102.book  Page 290  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

291
■Extended shared-media environment—This is a special type of shared-media 
environment in which networking devices can extend the environment so that 
it can accommodate multiple access or longer cable distances. Using Ethernet 
repeaters or multiple hubs can create an extended shared-media environment. 
This creates an extended collision domain.
■Point-to-point network environment—This is widely used in dialup network 
connections and is the most familiar to the home user. It is a shared networking 
environment in which one device is connected to only one other device, such as 
connecting a computer to an Internet service provider by modem and a phone 
line. Because this is a point-to-point dedicated connection, there is no potential 
for collisions. No other devices share the link. 
Figure 5-24 Directly Connected Networks
Indirectly Connected Networks
Some networks are indirectly connected, meaning that some higher-layer networking 
devices or some geographical distance is between the two communicating hosts. Fig-
ure 5-25 also shows the two types of indirectly connected networks, which are 
described as follows:
■Circuit-switched—An indirectly connected network in which actual electrical 
circuits are maintained for the duration of the communication. Circuit switching 
sets up a physical, end-to-end connection between the endpoints. The bandwidth

is dedicated to this point-to-point connection. The current telephone system is 
still, in part, circuit-switched, although the telephone systems in many countries 
now are concentrating less on circuit-switched technologies. Because this is not a 
shared environment, there are no collisions.
■Packet-switched—Instead of dedicating a link as an exclusive circuit connection 
between two communicating hosts, the source sends messages in packets. Each 
packet contains enough information for it to be routed to the proper destination 
host. Packet-switched networks frequently share physical media, but because log-
ical point-to-point connections are created, there are no collisions.
Figure 5-25 Indirectly Connected Networks
Collisions and Collision Domains
It is important to identify the medium as a shared environment because this shared 
environment causes collisions. A similar situation can occur with an automobile on 
a highway. If there is only one car, there is nothing to collide with. However, if more 
than one automobile is trying to use the same section of road at the same time, as 
shown in Figure 5-26, a collision occurs. The same is true for networks: If more than 
one computer tries to transmit data on the same network segment at the same time, a 
collision occurs. 
A collision is a situation that can occur when 2 bits propagate at the same time on the 
same network. A small, slow network could work out a system that allows only two 
computers to send messages, with both agreeing to take turns. The problem is that many 
computers are connected to large networks, with each one wanting to communicate 
millions of bits every section.

Collision Domains and Broadcast Domains
293
Figure 5-26 Collision
Collision domains are the connected physical network segments where collisions can 
occur. Collisions cause the network to be inefﬁcient. Every time there is a collision on a 
network, all transmission stops for a period of time. This time is variable, as determined 
by a backoff algorithm for each network device, which is necessary to allow broadcast 
transmission to resume.
Except for a single isolated Ethernet LAN environment, the types of devices that inter-
connect the media segments deﬁne collision domains. These devices have been classiﬁed 
as OSI Layers 1, 2, or 3 devices. Layer 1 devices do not break up collision domains; 
Layers 2 and 3 devices do break up collision domains, as described in Figure 5-27. 
Breaking up or increasing the number of collision domains with Layer 2 and 3 devices 
is known as segmentation.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Layer 1 devices, such as repeaters and hubs, serve the primary function of extending 
the Ethernet cable segments. By extending the network, more hosts can be added. How-
ever, every host that is added increases the amount of potential trafﬁc on the network. 
Because Layer 1 devices pass on everything that is sent on the medium, the more trafﬁc
that is transmitted within a collision domain, the greater the chances of collisions are. 
The ﬁnal result is diminished network performance, which is even more pronounced if 
all the computers on that network demand large amounts of bandwidth. Simply put, 
Layer 1 devices extend collision domains, as shown in Figure 5-28, but the length of a 
LAN also can be overextended and can cause other collision issues.
Figure 5-28 A Repeater Increases the Collision Domain
The four-repeater rule in Ethernet states that no more than four repeaters or repeating 
hubs can be between any two computers on the network, as shown in Figure 5-29. To 
ensure that a repeated 10BASET network will function properly, the round-trip delay 
calculation must be within certain limits; otherwise, all the workstations will not be 
capable of hearing all the collisions on the network.

Repeater latency, propagation delay, and NIC latency all contribute to the four-repeater 
rule. Exceeding the four-repeater rule can lead to violating the maximum delay limit. 
When this delay limit is exceeded, the numbers of late collisions dramatically increase. 
A late collision occurs when a collision happens after the ﬁrst 64 bytes of the frame are 
transmitted. The chip sets in NICs are not required to retransmit automatically when a 
late collision occurs. These late-collision frames add delay that is referred to as con-
sumption delay. As consumption delay and latency increase, network performance 
decreases. This Ethernet rule of thumb also is known as the 5-4-3-2-1 rule. This means 
that the following guidelines should not be exceeded:
■Host sections consist of
— 5 sections of network media 
— 4 repeaters or hubs
— 3 sections of the network
■2 sections are link sections (no hosts)
■1 large collision domain
Segmentation
For a networking professional, one important skill is the ability to recognize collision 
domains. Connecting several computers to a single shared-access medium that has no 
other networking devices attached creates a collision domain. This situation limits the 
number of computers that can use the medium, also called a segment. As illustrated in 
Figure 5-30, Layer 1 devices extend but do not control collision domains. 
Layer 2 devices segment or divide collision domains. Controlling frame propagation 
using the MAC address assigned to every Ethernet device performs this function. Layer 2 
devices, bridges and switches, keep track of the MAC addresses and which segment 
they are on. By doing this, these devices can control the ﬂow of trafﬁc at the Layer 2 
level. This function makes networks more efﬁcient by allowing data to be transmitted 
on different segments of the LAN at the same time, without the frames colliding. By 
using bridges and switches, the collision domain effectively is broken up into smaller 
parts, each being its own collision domain. 
These smaller collision domains will have fewer hosts and less trafﬁc than the original 
domain, and thereby increase the amount of bandwidth available to each host in that 
domain. The lower the amount of trafﬁc is in a collision domain, the greater the chance 
there is that when a host wants to transmit data, the media will be available. This 
works well as long as the trafﬁc between segments is not too heavy. Otherwise, the 
Layer 2 device actually can slow communication and become a bottleneck itself.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Figure 5-30 Layer 1 Devices Extend the Collision Domains
Layer 3 devices, like Layer 2 devices, do not forward collisions. Because of this, the use 
of Layer 3 devices in a network has the effect of breaking up collision domains into 
smaller domains. Layer 3 devices perform more functions than just breaking up a col-
lision domain. These devices and their functions are covered in more depth in the sec-
tion, “Broadcast Domains.” Figure 5-31 illustrates that Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices 
can break up the collision domain.

Figure 5-31 Limiting the Collision Domain
Layer 2 Broadcasts
To communicate with all collision domains, protocols use broadcast and multicast 
frames at Layer 2 of the OSI model. When a node needs to communicate with all hosts 
on the network, it sends a frame with a destination MAC address 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF 
(a broadcast). This is an address to which the NIC of every host must recognize. 
Layer 2 devices must ﬂood all broadcast and multicast trafﬁc. The accumulation of 
broadcast and multicast trafﬁc from each device in the network is referred to as broad-
cast radiation. Figure 5-32 illustrates a bridge forwarding the broadcast to all hosts on 
the network.
Because the NIC must interrupt the CPU to process each broadcast or multicast group 
that it belongs to, broadcast radiation affects the performance of hosts in the network. 
Most often, the host does not beneﬁt from processing the broadcast because it is not 
the destination being sought. Either the host does not care about the service that is 
being advertised or it already knows about the service. High levels of broadcast radia-
tion noticeably can degrade host performance, as shown in Figure 5-33. The three 
sources of broadcasts and multicasts in IP networks are workstations, routers, and 
multicast applications.
Workstations broadcast an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request every time they 
need to locate a MAC address that is not in the ARP table. For example, the command 
telnet mumble.com translates into an IP address through a Domain Name System (DNS) 
search, and then an ARP request is broadcast to ﬁnd the actual station. Generally, IP 
workstations cache 10 to 100 addresses about 2 hours. The ARP rate for a typical 
workstation might be about 50 addresses every 2 hours, or 0.007 ARPs per second. 
Thus, 2000 IP end stations produce about 14 ARPs per second.

Table 5-7 lists the average number of broadcast and multicasts for IP networks.
Although the numbers in Table 5-7 might appear low, they represent an average, well-
designed IP network that is not running the Routing Information Protocol (RIP). When 
broadcast and multicast trafﬁc peak because of storm behavior, peak CPU loss can be 
orders of magnitude greater than average. Broadcast storms can be caused by a device 
requesting information from a network that has grown too large. So many responses 
are sent to the original request that the device cannot process them, or the ﬁrst request 
triggers similar requests from other devices that effectively block normal trafﬁc ﬂow 
on the network.
An IP router is a router or workstation that runs any distance vector routing protocol. 
Some administrators conﬁgure all workstations to run RIP (a routing protocol) as a 
redundancy and reachability policy. Every 30 seconds, RIP uses broadcasts to retrans-
mit the entire RIP routing table to other RIP routers. If a large number of routers were 
conﬁgured to run RIP and, on average, 50 packets were required to transmit the routing 
table, the routers would generate 3333 broadcasts per second. Most network adminis-
trators conﬁgure only a small number of routers—usually ﬁve to ten—to run RIP. For 
a routing table that has a size of 50 packets, 10 RIP routers would generate about 16 
broadcasts per second. (Routing protocols and routing table are discussed in Chapter 8, 
“Routing Fundamentals and Subnets.”)
IP multicast applications adversely can affect the performance of large, scaled, switched 
networks. Although multicasting is an efﬁcient way to send a stream of multimedia 
data to many users on a shared-media hub, it affects every user on a ﬂat-switched net-
work. A ﬂat-switched network is a network of interconnected switches that does not 
utilize Layer 3 routing or something similar. A particular packet video application 
can generate a 7-megabyte (MB) stream of multicast data that, in a switched network, 
would be sent to every segment, resulting in severe congestion.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Broadcast Domains
A broadcast domain is a grouping of collision domains that are connected by Layer 2 
devices. Breaking up a LAN into multiple collision domains improves network efﬁciency 
by allowing multiple transmissions of data simultaneously on separate collision domains. 
But broadcasts travel across the Layer 2 devices and, if excessive, can reduce the efﬁ-
ciency of the overall LAN. Broadcasts must be controlled at Layer 3 because Layer 1 
and 2 devices have no way of controlling them. The total size of a broadcast domain 
can be identiﬁed by looking at all of the collision domains that the same broadcast frame 
is processed by. In other words, all the nodes are a part of that network segment bounded 
by a Layer 3 device. Broadcast domains are controlled at Layer 3 because routers do not 
forward broadcasts. In Figure 5-34, the router will not forward the broadcast from the 
blue-highlighted workstation in the left side to the hosts on the right.
Routers actually work at Layers 1, 2, and 3. Like all Layer 1 devices, they have a phys-
ical connection to and transmit data onto the medium. They have a Layer 2 encapsula-
tion on all interfaces and perform just like any other Layer 2 device. Layer 3 allows the 
router to segment broadcast domains. 
For a packet to be forwarded through a router, it must have been processed already by 
Layer 2, and the frame information must have been stripped off. Layer 3 forwarding is 
based on the destination IP address, not the MAC address. For a packet to be forwarded, 
it must contain an IP address that is outside the range of addresses assigned to the LAN 
segment, and the router must have a destination to send the speciﬁc packet to in its 
routing table.
Introduction to Data Flow
Data ﬂow in the context of collision and broadcast domains focuses on how data frames 
propagate through a network. It refers to the movement of data through Layer 1, 2, and 
3 devices, as well as how data must be encapsulated to effectively make that journey. 
Remember that data is encapsulated at the network layer with an IP source and destina-
tion address, and at the data link layer with a MAC source and destination address. 
The basic rule to follow here is that a Layer 1 device always forwards the frame, a 
Layer 2 device wants to forward the frame (in other words, it forwards unless some-
thing prevents it), and a Layer 3 device does not forward unless it has to. Using this 
rule helps identify how data ﬂows through a network.

Figure 5-34 Broadcast Domain Segmentation
Layer 1 devices (repeaters and hubs) do no ﬁltering, so everything that is received is 
passed on to the next segment. The frame simply is regenerated and retimed. and thus 
returned to its original transmission quality. Any segments connected by Layer 1 devices 
are part of the same domain, both collision and broadcast.
Layer 2 devices (bridges and switches) ﬁlter data frames based on the destination MAC 
address. A frame is forwarded if it is going to an unknown destination (outside the col-
lision domain). The frame also is forwarded if it is a broadcast, multicast, or unicast 
going outside the local collision domain. The only time that a frame is not forwarded 
is when the Layer 2 device ﬁnds that the sending host and the receiving host are in the 
same collision domain. A bridging device (Layer 2) creates multiple collision domains 
but maintains only one broadcast domain.
Layer 3 devices (routers and some high-end switches) ﬁlter data packets based on 
IP destination address. The only way that a packet is forwarded is if its destination IP

address is outside the broadcast domain and the router has an identiﬁed location to 
send the packet. A Layer 3 device creates multiple collision and broadcast domains.
Data ﬂow through a routed IP-based network involves data moving across trafﬁc-
management devices at Layers 1, 2, and 3 of the OSI model Layer 1 is used for trans-
mission across the physical medium, Layer 2 is used for collision domain management, 
and Layer 3 is used for broadcast domain management. Figure 5-35 shows data ﬂowing 
from Workstation X through Routers A, B, and C to Workstation Y.

Network Segment
As with many terms and acronyms, segment has multiple meanings. The dictionary 
deﬁnition of the term is as follows:
■A separate piece of something
■One of the parts into which an entity or quantity is divided or marked off by, 
or as if by natural boundaries
In the context of data communication, the following deﬁnitions are used:
■Section of a network that is bounded by bridges, routers, or switches.
■In a LAN using a bus topology, a continuous electrical circuit that is often 
connected to other such segments with repeaters.

■Term used in the TCP speciﬁcation to describe a single transport layer unit of 
information. The terms datagram, frame, message, and packet also are used to 
describe logical information groupings at various layers of the OSI reference 
model and in various technology circles.
Figure 5-36 illustrates the three deﬁnitions of the term segment within the content of 
the data communication.

To deﬁne the term segment properly, the context of the usage must be presented with 
the word. If segment is used in the context of TCP, it is deﬁned as a separate piece of 
the data. If segment is being used in the context of physical networking media in a 
routed network, it is seen as one of the parts or sections of the total network.

Summary
The following key points were presented in this section:
■The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is a professional 
organization that deﬁnes network standards. IEEE LAN standards are the best-
known IEEE communication standards and are the predominant LAN standards 
in the world today. 
■The IEEE divides the OSI data link layer into two separate sublayers: Media 
Access Control (MAC) and Logical Link Control (LLC).
■Ethernet uses the MAC address, which is the physical address located on a NIC.
■Framing helps obtain essential information that could not otherwise be obtained 
with coded bit streams alone.
■Two broad categories of Media Access Control exist: deterministic (taking turns) 
and nondeterministic (ﬁrst come, ﬁrst served). 
■Ethernet uses carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD).
■Half-duplex transmission enables signals to travel in either direction, but not in 
both directions simultaneously. Full-duplex transmission enables data to be sent 
and received at the same time.
■Using a shared-media environment can cause trafﬁc congestion that leads to 
network inefﬁciency.
■The most common (and usually benign) error condition on an Ethernet is the 
collision.
■The main Ethernet frame error types that can be captured through a protocol-
analysis session are local collision, remote collision, and late collision.
■Situations that are considered Ethernet errors are jabber, long frame, short frame, 
runts, FCS errors, alignment error, and range error.
■The fundamental grouping of devices in a shared-media environment is a 
collision domain.
■Collision domains can be segmented to reduce congestion and improve network 
efﬁciency.
■Collision domains are segmented by both Layer 2 and Layer 3 devices.
■Broadcasts are designed to travel throughout collision domains and can cause 
network inefﬁciency.
■Broadcast domains can be segmented by using Layer 3 devices.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
Key Terms
10-Gb Ethernet
Built on the Ethernet technology used in most of today’s LANs, 10-Gb 
Ethernet is described as a technology that offers a more efﬁcient and less expensive 
approach to moving data on backbone connections between networks, while also 
providing a consistent technology end to end. Ethernet now can step up to offering 
data speeds at 10 Gbps.
alignment error
A message that does not end on an octet boundary.
backoff
The retransmission delay enforced when a collision occurs.
broadcast
A data packet that is sent to all nodes on a network. Broadcasts are 
identiﬁed by a broadcast address. 
broadcast domain
A set of all devices that will receive broadcast frames originating 
from any device within the set. Broadcast domains typically are bounded by routers 
(or, in a switched network, by VLANs) because routers do not forward broadcast 
frames.
collision
In Ethernet, the result of two nodes transmitting simultaneously. The 
frames from each device impact and are damaged when they meet on the physical 
media. See also collision domain.
collision domain
In Ethernet, the network area within which frames that have 
collided are propagated. Repeaters and hubs propagate collisions; LAN switches, 
bridges, and routers do not. 
connectionless
Data transfer without the existence of a virtual circuit. 
CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access collision detect)
A media-access mecha-
nism wherein devices ready to transmit data ﬁrst check the channel for a carrier. If 
no carrier is sensed for a speciﬁc period of time, a device can transmit. If two devices 
transmit at once, a collision occurs and is detected by all colliding devices. This colli-
sion subsequently delays retransmissions from those devices for some random length 
of time. CSMA/CD access is used by Ethernet and IEEE 802.3.
encapsulation
Wrapping of data in a particular protocol header. For example, upper-
layer data is wrapped in a speciﬁc Ethernet header before network transit. Also, when 
bridging dissimilar networks, the entire frame from one network simply can be placed 
behind the header used by the data link layer protocol of the other network.
Ethernet
A baseband LAN speciﬁcation invented by Xerox Corporation and devel-
oped jointly by Xerox, Intel, and Digital Equipment Corporation. Ethernet networks

Key Terms
307
Fast Ethernet
Any of a number of 100-Mbps Ethernet speciﬁcations. Fast Ethernet 
offers a speed increase 10 times that of the 10BASE-T Ethernet speciﬁcation, while 
preserving such qualities as frame format, MAC mechanisms, and MTU. Such similar-
ities allow the use of existing 10BASE-T applications and network-management tools 
on Fast Ethernet networks. Fast Ethernet is based on an extension to the IEEE 802.3 
speciﬁcation.
FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface)
A LAN standard, deﬁned by American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) 3T9.5, specifying a 100-Mbps token-passing 
network using ﬁber-optic cable, with transmission distances of up to 2 km. FDDI 
uses a dual-ring architecture to provide redundancy. 
full duplex
The capability for simultaneous data transmission between a sending 
station and a receiving station. 
ghost
Fluke Networks coined this new term to mean energy (noise) detected on the 
cable that appears to be a frame but that lacks a valid SFD. To qualify as a ghost, this 
“frame” must be at least 72 octets long (including preamble); otherwise, it is classiﬁed 
as a remote collision.
Gigabit Ethernet
Standard for a high-speed Ethernet, approved by the IEEE 802.3z 
standards committee in 1996.
half duplex
A capability for data transmission in only one direction at a time 
between a sending station and a receiving station. 
header
Control information placed before data when encapsulating that data for 
network transmission. 
IEEE 802.2
An IEEE LAN protocol that speciﬁes an implementation of the LLC sub-
layer of the data link layer. IEEE 802.2 handles errors, framing, ﬂow control, and the 
network layer (Layer 3) service interface. 
IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers)
A professional organization 
whose activities include the development of communications and network standards. 
IEEE LAN standards are the predominant LAN standards today.
IEEE 802.3
An IEEE LAN protocol that speciﬁes an implementation of the physical 
layer and the MAC sublayer of the data link layer. IEEE 802.3 uses CSMA/CD access 
at a variety of speeds over a variety of physical media. Extensions to the IEEE 802.3 
standard specify implementations for Fast Ethernet. Physical variations of the original 
IEEE 802.3 speciﬁcation include 10BASE2, 10BASE5, 10BASE-F, 10BASE-T, and 
10BROAD36. Physical variations for Fast Ethernet include 100BASE-TX and 
100BASE-FX.

Chapter 5: Ethernet Fundamentals
jabber
Deﬁned several places in the 802.3 standard as being a transmission of at least 
20,000 to 50,000 bit-times in duration. However, most diagnostic tools report jabber 
whenever a detected transmission exceeds the maximum legal frame size—which is 
considerably smaller than 20,000 to 50,000 bit-times. 
LLC (Logical Link Control)
The higher of the two data link layer sublayers deﬁned 
by the IEEE. The LLC sublayer handles error control, ﬂow control, framing, and 
MAC-sublayer addressing. The most prevalent LLC protocol is IEEE 802.2, which 
includes both connectionless and connection-oriented variants.
long frame
A frame that is longer than the maximum legal size and that takes into 
consideration whether the frame was tagged.
MAC (Media Access Control)
The lower of the two sublayers of the data link layer 
deﬁned by the IEEE. The MAC sublayer handles access to shared media, such as 
whether token passing or contention will be used. See also LLC.
MAC address
A standardized data link layer address that is required for every device 
that connects to a LAN. Other devices in the network use these addresses to locate 
speciﬁc devices in the network and to create and update routing tables and data struc-
tures. MAC addresses are 6 bytes long and are controlled by the IEEE. Also known as 
a hardware address, a MAC-layer address, or a physical address. 
MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
The maximum packet size, in bytes, that a 
particular interface can handle.
OUI (organizationally unique identiﬁer)
Three octets assigned by the IEEE in a 
block of 48-bit LAN addresses.
propagation delay
The time required for data to travel over a network from its 
source to its ultimate destination.
range error
A frame that had a legal-size value in the Length ﬁeld but that did not 
match the actual number of octets counted in the Data ﬁeld of the received frame.
segment
A section of a network that is bounded by bridges, routers, or switches.
simplex
The capability for transmission in only one direction between a sending 
station and a receiving station. Broadcast television is an example of a simplex 
technology. 
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
A network-management protocol 
used almost exclusively in TCP/IP networks. SNMP provides a means of monitoring 
and controlling network devices and managing conﬁgurations, statistics collection, 
performance, and security.

Chapter 6
Ethernet Technologies and
Ethernet Switching
Ethernet, along with its associated IEEE 802.3 protocols, is one of the world’s most 
important networking standards. Because of the great success of the original Ethernet 
and the soundness of its design, it has evolved over time. This evolution was in response 
to the developing needs of modern LANs. Ethernet most likely will continue to evolve in 
response to future demands for network capability. 
The previous chapter introduced both the history of Ethernet and the standards associated 
with Ethernet. You also learned that the term Ethernet refers a family of the Ethernet 
technologies. This chapter discusses the Ethernet technologies in more detail. 
In addition, this chapter introduces Layer 2 bridging and switching techniques. Switching 
and bridging are techniques that decrease congestion in LANs by reducing trafﬁc and 
increasing bandwidth. 
Finally, this chapter introduces the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), tells how STP works, 
and covers the STP switch port states.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and PhotoZooms 
that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
10-Mbps and 100-Mbps Ethernet
This section introduces the speciﬁcs of the most important varieties of Ethernet. The goal 
is not to memorize all the facts about each type of Ethernet, but rather to develop a sense 
of what is common to all forms of Ethernet and what are the speciﬁc strengths and weak-
nesses of the commercially important forms of Ethernet.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
Ethernet’s popularity began with the thick coaxial 10BASE5. However, Thicknet cable 
had undesirable installation properties. 10BASE2 used Thinnet—thinner coaxial cable that 
was easier to install and terminate; the distance decreased from 500 to 185 meters (m). 
This trend toward easy installation and lower cost took a great step forward with the 
introduction of UTP-based 10BASE-T. However, the length that an unrepeated signal 
could travel decreased to 100m, necessitating the introduction of repeaters and then 
multiport repeaters (hubs). The repeater concept allowed 10BASE-T networks of up 
to 500m. As workgroups grew in size and applications increased in complexity, the 
shared bandwidth of the hub became a limiting factor. The introduction of Ethernet 
10BASE-T switches addressed both the length and bandwidth limitations—station-to-
switch links were now point-to-point. 
The power, versatility, and cost-effectiveness of 10BASE-T coincided with an explosion 
in the number of LAN users, the number of Internet users (which also increased LAN 
trafﬁc), and the complexity of applications. Demand for higher bandwidth grew, and 
Fast Ethernet was introduced. The copper cable version of Fast Ethernet that became 
commercially successful was 100BASE-TX, and many clever features were developed for 
interoperability with 10BASE-T systems (the emergence of 10/100 interfaces, for example). 
To compete with the backbone/LAN technology of FDDI, ﬁber-based 100BASE-FX was 
introduced. Throughout all of these Ethernet technologies, the MAC addressing concept, 
the frame format, and the CSMA/CD MAC method were maintained.
10-Mbps Versions of Ethernet
Figure 6-1 shows a subset of physical layer implementations that you can deploy to 
support Ethernet. The 10BASE5, 10BASE2, and 10BASE-T implementations of Ether-
net are considered legacy implementations and are referred to as such in the sections

Four things are common among legacy Ethernet:
■Timing parameters
■Frame format
■Transmission process
■A basic design rule 
After you learn about what these three historically important versions have in common, 
you will examine each in more detail.
10BASE5, 10BASE2, and 10BASE-T all share the same timing parameters, as shown 
in Table 6-1. Note that 1 bit-time at 10 Mbps = 100 nanosecond = 0.1 µsecond = 1 
ten-millionth of a second.
The frame format is common to 10BASE5, 10BASE2, and 10BASE-T. Figure 6-2 
shows an Ethernet frame as observed at the MAC sublayer.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
The Legacy Ethernet transmission process is identical until the lower part of the OSI 
physical layer. As the frame passes from the MAC sublayer to the physical layer, further 
processes occur before the bits are placed on the medium from the physical layer. One 
process that is particularly important at this level is the signal quality error (SQE) signal. 
This signal is typical of what you will see in many networking technologies. At the phys-
ical layer, the network is “alive” with communications other than the user data to ensure 
a properly functioning network. SQE always is used in half duplex; it is not required but 
is permitted in full-duplex operation. SQE is active in the following instances: 
■Within 4 to 8 microseconds following a normal transmission, to indicate that 
the outbound frame successfully was transmitted.
■Whenever there is a collision on the medium.
■Whenever there is an improper signal on the medium. Improper signals might 
include detected jabber, or the reﬂections that result from a cable fault, such as a 
short. (There are separate conditions depending on which medium is attached.)
■Whenever a transmission has been interrupted as jabber—that is, it has transmitted 
longer than allowed. 
All 10-Mbps forms of Ethernet take octets received from the MAC sublayer and per-
form a process called line encoding. Line encoding describes how the bits actually are 
signaled on the wire. The simplest encodings (such as nonreturn to zero, or NRZ, in 
which a 1 bit is 5 volts [V] and the 0 bits are 0V) typically have undesirable timing and 
electrical characteristics. Therefore, line codes have been engineered to have desirable 
transmission properties and tailored to each medium. The form of line encoding used 
in 10-Mbps systems is called Manchester encoding. Figure 6-3 shows a Manchester 
encoding example. The y-axis is voltage; the x-axis is time.
Figure 6-3 Manchester Encoding Examples
NOTE
In NRZ encoding, sig-
nals are maintained 
at constant voltage 
levels, with no signal 
transitions (no return 
to a 0V level) during a 
bit interval.

Manchester encoding relies on the direction of the edge transition in the middle of the 
timing window to determine the binary value for that bit period. In the encoding exam-
ple shown in Figure 6-3, one timing window is highlighted vertically through all four 
waveform examples. The top waveform has a falling edge in the center of the timing 
window, so it is interpreted as a binary 0. 
The result is that in the center of the timing window for the second waveform, there is 
a rising edge, which is interpreted as a binary 1.
Instead of a repeating sequence of the same binary value in the third waveform example, 
there is an alternating binary sequence. In the ﬁrst two examples, the signal must tran-
sition back between each bit period so that it can make the same-direction transition 
each time in the center of the timing window. With alternating binary data, there is no 
need to return to the previous voltage level in preparation for the next edge in the center 
of the timing window. Thus, any time there is a long separation between one edge and 
the next, you can be certain that both edges represent the middle of a timing window. 
The fourth waveform example is random data that enables you verify that whenever 
there is a wide separation between two transitions, both edges are in the center of a 
timing window and represent the binary value for that timing window.
Legacy (10-Mbps) Ethernet has some common architectural features. All of these legacy 
versions are referred to as shared Ethernet because they share a common collision domain. 
It is not only allowed, but it is expected that an Ethernet network could contain multi-
ple types of media (for example, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BASE-T, and so on). The 
standard goes out of its way to ensure that interoperability is maintained. However, 
when implementing a mixed-media network, it is important to pay particular attention 
to the overall architecture design. It becomes easier to violate maximum delay limits as 
the network grows and becomes more complex. The timing limits are based on param-
eters such as these: 
■Cable length and its propagation delay
■Delay of repeaters
■Delay of transceivers (including NICs, hubs, and switches)
■Interframe gap shrinkage 
■Delays within the station
Lab Activity
Waveform Decoding
The purpose of this lab is to integrate knowledge of networking media; OSI 
Layers 1, 2, and 3; and Ethernet, by decoding a digital waveform of an 
Ethernet frame.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
5-4-3 Rule 
10-Mbps Ethernet operates within the timing limits offered by a series of no more than 
ﬁve segments separated by no more than four repeaters. That is, no more than four 
repeaters can be connected in series between any two distant stations. The coaxial 
implementations have a further requirement that there can be no more than three pop-
ulated segments between any two distant stations. The other two allowed coaxial seg-
ments are used to extend the diameter of the collision domain and are called link segments. 
The primary characteristic of a link segment is that it has exactly two devices attached. 
All twisted-pair links, such as 10BASE-T, meet the deﬁnition of a link segment.  
10BASE5
The original (1980) Ethernet product (10BASE5) transmitted 10 Mbps over a single 
thick coaxial cable bus, thus the name Thicknet. 10BASE5 is important for historical 
reasons: It was the ﬁrst medium used for Ethernet. 10BASE5 was part of the original 
802.3 standard. It can be found today as part of legacy installations. It is not a preferred 
choice for new networks because its primary beneﬁt, length, can be accomplished in 
other ways. Although 10BASE5 systems are inexpensive and require no conﬁguration 
(there is no need for hubs to extend the length of the system), basic components such 
as NICs are very difﬁcult to ﬁnd, and the technology is very sensitive to signal reﬂections 
on the cable. In addition, 10BASE5 systems are very cable-dependent across the whole 
collision domain and thus represent a large single point of failure.
The timing, frame format, and transmission process were described previously in 
Chapter 5, “Ethernet Fundamentals,” and are common to all 10-Mbps legacy Ethernet.
10BASE5 uses Manchester-encoded signals on thick coaxial cable. Figure 6-4 is an 
example of a 10BASE5 signal. It is transmitted from approximately 0V to –1V. 10BASE5 
potentially could be idle (0V) for days if no station wanted to transmit. 10BASE5 is 
asynchronous.

In Figure 6-4, timing marks have been added to aid you in recognizing the timing 
windows from which the binary data was decoded. The y-axis is voltage; the x-axis is 
time. Voltage has been measured between the central conductor and the outer sheath-
ing of the coaxial cable.
A 10BASE5 thick coax cable, as shown in Figure 6-5, has a solid central conductor, a 
minimum nominal velocity of propagation (NVP) of 0.77c, and 50 ohms of impedance/
termination resistance; it uses N-style screw-on connections. Each of the maximum ﬁve 
segments of thick coax can be up to 500m (1640 ft.) long, and each station is con-
nected to a transceiver on the coax via an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) cable that 
can be up to 50m (164 ft.) long. The cable is large, heavy, and difﬁcult to install, but 
the distance limitations were favorable; this prolonged its use in certain applications. 
Figure 6-5 10BASE5 Thicknet Cable
Other speciﬁcations or limitations of 10BASE5 cable include the following:
■Only one station can transmit at a time (or a collision will occur). 
■10BASE5 can run only in half-duplex mode, subject to the CSMA/CD rules. 
■Up to 100 stations, including repeaters, can exist on any individual 10BASE5 
segment.
10BASE2
10BASE2 (originally 802.3a-1985) was introduced in 1985 because its coaxial cable of 
a smaller size, lighter weight, and greater ﬂexibility made installation easier than 10BASE5. 
Because of its use of thinner cable, 10BASE2 often is referred to as Thinnet. 10BASE2 
still exists in legacy networks. Although there is little reason to install a 10BASE2 net-
work today, its low cost and lack of need for hubs are attractive. Essentially, 10BASE2 
requires no conﬁguration, although obtaining NICs is increasingly difﬁcult. Just like 
10BASE5 systems, 10BASE2 systems are very cable-dependent across the whole colli-
sion domain and represent a large single point of failure.
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously in Chapter 5 
and are common to all 10-Mbps Legacy Ethernet.

322
Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
10BASE2 uses Manchester-encoded signals on thin coaxial cable. A 10BASE2 signal 
is transmitted from approximately 0V to –1V. (The y-axis is voltage; the x-axis is time. 
Voltage is measured between the center conductor and the outer sheathing conductor.) 
10BASE2 potentially could be idle (0V) for days if no station wanted to transmit. 10BASE2 
is asynchronous.
The computers on the LAN were linked together like the beads of a necklace by an 
unbroken series of coaxial cable lengths. These lengths of coaxial cable were attached 
by British Naval Connectors (BNCs) to a T-shape connector on the NIC, as shown in 
Figure 6-6. This single coaxial cable was the shared bus for the network. Workstations 
easily could be moved and reattached, or new workstations could be added to the LAN. 
Otherwise, 10BASE2 used the same original Ethernet half-duplex protocol.
A 10BASE2 thin coax cable, as shown in Figure 6-8, has a stranded central conductor. 
(Be sure that stranded coax is speciﬁed when new cable is ordered. Some installers ﬁnd 
it hard to work with and use solid-core coax when possible.) It has a minimum nomi-
nal velocity of propagation (NVP) of 0.65c, has 50 ohms of impedance/termination 
resistance, and uses BNC T-style connections. Each of the maximum ﬁve segments of 
thin coax can be up to 185m long (600 ft.), and each station is connected directly to 
the BNC T connector on the coax.

10BASE-T
10BASE-T (originally 802.3i-1990) substituted the cheaper and easier-to-install UTP 
copper cable for coaxial cable. This cable plugged into a central connection device, a 
hub or a switch, that contained the shared bus. The type of cable used in 10BASE-T, 
the distances that the cable could extend from the hub, and the way in which the UTP 
was installed, interconnected, and tested were standardized in a “structured cabling

system,” which increasingly speciﬁed a star or extended star topology. 10BASE-T was 
originally a half-duplex protocol, but full-duplex features were added later. The explo-
sion in Ethernet’s popularity in the 1990s—when Ethernet came to dominate LAN 
technology—was 10BASE-T running on Category (Cat) 5 UTP. To reacquaint yourself 
with network topologies and networking media, refer back to Chapter 2, “Networking 
Fundamentals,” and Chapter 3, “Networking Media.”
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously and are common 
to all 10-Mbps legacy Ethernet.
10BASE-T uses Manchester line-encoded signals over Category 3 (now 5, 5e, or 
better) UTP. 
10-Mbps Ethernet is asynchronous, and the cable often is completely idle (0V) for long 
periods of time between transmissions. 10BASE-T links have a link pulse present about 
every 125 milliseconds (eight times per second), but can otherwise be idle. 10BASE-T 
networks are “alive” with link pulses.
A 10BASE-T unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) cable has a solid conductor for each wire 
in the maximum 90m horizontal cable, which should be 0.4 mm to 0.6 mm (26 to 22 
American Wire Gauge [AWG]) in diameter. The 10m of allowed patch cables use similar-
dimension stranded cable for durability because it is expected to experience repeated 
ﬂexing. Suitable UTP cable has a minimum NVP of 0.585c, has 100 ohms of impedance, 
and uses eight-pin RJ-45 modular connectors as speciﬁed in ISO/IEC 8877. Cables 
between a station and a hub generally are described as between 0m and 100m long 
(0 ft. to 328 ft.), although the precise maximum length is determined by propagation 
delay through the link segment (any length that does not exceed 1000 ns of delay is 
acceptable). Usually, 0.5 mm (24 AWG) diameter UTP wire in a multipair cable will 
meet the requirements at 100m.
Although Category 3 cable is adequate for use on 10BASE-T networks, it is strongly 
recommended that any new cable installations be made with Category 5e or better 
materials and wiring practices. Use all four pairs, and use either the T568A or T568B 
cable pinout arrangement. With this type of cable installation, it should be possible to 
operate many different media access protocols (including 1000BASE-T) over the same 
cable plant, without rewiring.

Table 6-2 shows the pinout for a 10BASE-T connection. Notice that two separate 
transmit/receive paths exists (whereas coaxial cable has only one).
Figure 6-7 shows conceptual and physical connections between two stations. A cross-
over cable is required, so Tx on device A sends signals to Rx on device B. Note that 
two point-to-point connections exist (TxA to RxB, and TxB to RxA).

Figure 6-8 shows the connection between stations and repeaters, multiport repeaters 
(hubs), or switches. The same connection would be used between a router and a hub 
or a switch. A straight-through cable is used. Note that inside the hub is a bus topol-
ogy, which is a collision domain. When a workstation is connected to a switch using a 
straight-through cable, all individual links are point-to-point. The switch fabric circuitry 
allows full bandwidth simultaneously between pairs of ports without collisions.
Figure 6-8 10BASE-T Straight-Through Cable
Because station-to-station, switch-to-switch, and station-to-switch connections all are 
point-to-point links, they have two physically separate communication pathways/
channels on two separate UTP wire pairs. In this case, collisions are not physical events, 
but rather the result of the decision to not allow simultaneous Tx and Rx. Thus, either 
half duplex (subject to the administrative imposition of CSMA/CD) or full duplex (no 
physical collisions occur) is a conﬁguration choice. Most of the time, you run these 
connections in full duplex, which not only eliminates collisions, but also doubles the 
throughput of the connection. When ﬁrst introduced, the relevant IEEE standard was 
entitled 802.3x-1997 Full-Duplex. However, station-to-hub connections involve the 
bus topology within the hub, an actual physical collision domain. Hence, this connec-
tion can run only half duplex and is subject to CSMA/CD because of the physical 
nature of the structure. 
10BASE-T carries 10 Mbps of trafﬁc in half-duplex mode; however, 10BASE-T in full-
duplex mode actually can exchange 20 Mbps of trafﬁc (although, again, some of this is 
overhead, not user data). This concept will become increasingly important with the 
desire to increase the speed of Ethernet links.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
10BASE-T Architecture
10BASE-T links generally consist of a connection between the station and a hub or 
switch. Hubs should be thought of as multiport repeaters and count toward the limit 
on repeaters between distant stations. Switches can be thought of as multiport bridges 
and are subject to 100m length limitations but no limit on switches between distant 
stations.
Although hubs can be linked in series (sometimes called daisy-chaining, or cascading), 
it is best to avoid this arrangement when possible, to keep from violating the limit for 
maximum delay between distant stations. The physical size of a 10BASE-T network is 
subject to the same rules as 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 concerning the number of repeaters. 
When multiple hubs are required, it is best to arrange them in hierarchical order, to 
create a tree structure instead of a chain. Also, performance will be improved if fewer 
repeaters separate stations. “Stackable” hubs, or concentrators with common backplanes 
that will support several multiport adapter cards, permit large numbers of stations to 
be connected to a device that counts as a single hub (repeater). Daisy-chaining switches 
is ﬁne and is not subject to restrictions.
All distances between stations are acceptable, although in one direction, the architecture 
is at its limit. The most important aspect to consider is how to keep the delay between 
distant stations to a minimum—regardless of the architecture and media types involved. 
A shorter maximum delay provides better overall performance. Consider the following 
architectures:
■In Figure 6-9, there are ﬁve segments and four repeaters from Station 1 to any 
other station in these paths. For 10BASE-T connections, the maximum of three 
segments with stations does not apply because no other stations are on the same 
cable. Each connection is described as a link segment.

327
■In Figure 6-10, from any station (except Station 1) to any other station, the 
path is only three repeaters. Because these alternate paths include 10BASE5 and 
10BASE2 links, the other requirements still apply there (such as only three seg-
ments with stations).
Figure 6-10 Example 10-Mbps Mixed Architecture 2
10BASE-T links can have unrepeated distances up to 100m. This might seem like a 
long distance, but it typically is used up quickly when wiring an actual building. Hubs 
can solve this distance issue, although a maximum of four repeaters could be chained 
together because of timing considerations. The widespread introduction of switches 
has made this distance limitation less important. As long as workstations are located 
within 100m of a switch, the 100m distance starts over at the switch, which could 
be connected via another 100m to another switch, and so on. Because most modern 
10BASE-T Ethernet is switched, these are the practical limits between devices. Ring, 
star, and extended star topologies all are allowed. The issue then becomes one of logi-
cal topology and data ﬂow, not timing or distance limitations.  
Table 6-3 shows a chart of the 10BASE-T link characteristics.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
100-Mbps Versions of Ethernet
100-Mbps Ethernet, also known as Fast Ethernet (in comparison to the original 10-Mbps 
Ethernet), was a series of technologies. The two technologies that became commercially 
important are 100BASE-TX (copper UTP-based) and 100BASE-FX (multimode optical 
ﬁber-based). This section examines the commonalities between these two technologies 
and then examines their differences individually. 
Three things are common to 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX: 
■The timing parameters
■The frame format
■Parts of the transmission process
Table 6-4 shows the parameters for 100-Mbps Ethernet operation.
100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX both share timing parameters. Note that 1 bit-time in 
1000-Mbps Ethernet is 10 nsec = .01 microseconds = 1 100-millionth of a second.
The 100-Mbps frame format is the same as the 10-Mbps frame. Unlike 10-Mbps 
Ethernet, in which the process was the same for all technologies until the signal was 
applied to the medium. 
Fast Ethernet represents a tenfold increase in speed. With this increase in speed comes 
extra requirements. The bits being sent get shorter in duration and occur more frequently. 
They require more careful timing, and their transmission requires frequencies closer to

medium-bandwidth limitations and become more susceptible to noise. In response to 
these issues of synchronization, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), two sepa-
rate encoding steps are used by 100-Mbps Ethernet. The basic idea is to use codes—
which can be engineered to have desirable properties—to represent the user data in a 
way that is efﬁcient to transmit, including synchronization, efﬁcient usage of band-
width, and improved SNR characteristics. The ﬁrst part of the encoding uses a technique 
called 4-bit/5-bit (4B/5B); the second part of the encoding is the actual line encoding 
speciﬁc to copper or ﬁber.
The two forms of 100-Mbps Ethernet of consideration in this course, 100BASE-TX 
and 100BASE-FX, encode nibbles (4-bit groupings) from the upper parts of the MAC 
sublayer. The 4-bit patterns are converted into 5-bit symbols; symbols sometimes con-
trol information (such as start frame, end frame, or medium-is-idle conditions). The 
entire frame to be transmitted is comprised of control symbols and data symbols (data 
code groups). Again, all of this extra complexity is necessary to achieve the tenfold 
increase in network speed.
After the 4B/5B encoding, the bits (in the form of code groups) still need to be placed 
on the medium (that is, they must be line-encoded). The conversion from 4 bits to 
5 bits also means that there are now 125 Mbps to be transmitted instead of 100 Mbps 
during the same time interval. This puts more strict requirements on the medium, 
transmitters, and receivers used. For example, the cable must be tested at higher fre-
quencies to ensure proper transmission characteristics. Any time that there is no data 
to be sent, “idle code” groups still are sent to ﬁll the empty periods and maintain syn-
chronization. At this point, the data path diverges depending on whether you are using 
copper (100BASE-TX) or ﬁber (100BASE-FX) media.
100BASE-TX
The need for faster networks led to the announcement of the 100BASE-T Fast Ethernet 
and autonegotiation standard in 1995 (originally 802.3u-1995). 100BASE-T increased 
Ethernet’s bit rate to 100 Mbps. 100BASE-TX was the Category 5 UTP version of 
100BASE-T that became commercially successful. Soon 10/100 hubs and switches 
enabled Ethernet transmissions at the original rate of 10 Mbps to share the network 
with frames sent at 100 Mbps. 
The original coaxial Ethernet used half-duplex transmission; therefore, only one device 
could transmit at a time. In 1997, Ethernet was expanded to include a full-duplex 
capability (originally 802.3x) that allowed more than one PC on a network to transmit 
at the same time. Devices called Ethernet switches were developed that enabled this 
full-duplex communication and handled network trafﬁc more efﬁciently than hubs.

330
Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
These switches increasingly replaced hubs in high-speed networks because of their full-
duplex capability and rapid handling of Ethernet frames. 
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously in Chapter 5 
and are common to both versions of 100-Mpbs Fast Ethernet considered in this chapter. 
100BASE-TX uses 4B/5B encoded data, which then is scrambled and converted to 
multilevel transmit—three levels, or MLT-3, line encoding on Category 5 UTP (or 
better). The MLT-3 encoding converts the binary data stream to an electrical wave-
form using a continuous signaling system. MLT-3 is different from nonreturn to zero 
inverted (NRZI), in that the signal level alternates between above and below the zero 
level instead of using only two levels.
Figure 6-11 shows some MLT-3 encoding examples. The basic rule of MLT-3 is that 
binary 1s cause the voltage level to cycle to the next level down and then back up again. 
Binary 0s do not cause a level transition.
Figure 6-11 MLT-3 Encoding Examples
In the encoding example in Figure 6-11, one timing window is highlighted vertically 
through all four waveform examples. The top waveform has no transition in the center 
of the timing window. No transition indicates that a binary 0 is present. If the example 
waveform was all 0s on that line, the signal level represented would be either a constant 
high, 0, or low across the waveform. A single 1 was introduced to move the remaining 
0s to a different voltage level and show that 0s can appear at more than one voltage 
level. The level depends upon what the previous (high or low) voltage level was and 
moves in the opposite direction. In this ﬁrst waveform, it is thus evident that the previ-
ous voltage level (not shown) was a low level. 
NOTE
In NRZI encoding, 
signals maintain con-
stant voltage levels 
with no signal transi-
tions (no return to a 
0V level) but interpret 
the presence of data at 
the beginning of a bit 
interval as a signal 
transition. Likewise, 
they interpret the 
absence of data as 
no transition.

The second waveform in Figure 6-11 has a transition in the center of the timing window. 
A binary 1 is represented by a transition. It does not matter whether the transition is 
rising or falling, or whether the new level reached is high, 0, or low. Instead of a repeat-
ing sequence of the same binary value in the third waveform example, there is an alter-
nating binary sequence. Again, this pattern helps demonstrate that the absence of a 
transition indicates a binary 0, and the presence of a transition indicates a binary 1. 
Rising or falling edges indicate 1s. The very steep signal changes from one extreme to 
the other, with a slight decrease in gradient at 0, indicate consecutive 1s. Any notice-
able horizontal line in the signal indicates a 0, or consecutive 0s.
Figure 6-12 is an example of 100BASE-TX signal taken from an oscilloscope. (In Fig-
ure 6-12, the y-axis is voltage; the x-axis is time. Voltage is measured as a differential 
signal between 2.)
Figure 6-12 100BASE-TX Signal Sample
During the initial process of establishing synchronization with the link partner to 
establish a link, the receiver circuit expects to see only 4B/5B idle code groups.
The cable pinout for a 100BASE-TX connection is identical to the one for 10BASE-T. 
Two separate transmit/receive paths exist. For the connection between two stations or 
two switches, a crossover cable is required. As for the connection between stations and 
repeaters/multiport repeaters (hubs), a straight-through cable is used. Note that inside 
an exclusively 100-Mbps hub is a bus topology, which is a collision domain. However, 
if the hub is a 10/100 autosensing hub, which is vastly more common, the internal 
topology is more complex, to account for the speed differential between 10BASE-T 
and 100BASE-TX. It should be noted that, even though a 100-Mbps Ethernet hub is 
signiﬁcantly faster than a 10-Mbps hub, collisions are still a problem because both are 
based on a shared bus architecture. Only through the use of switches and full duplex 
are collisions avoided. 
For the connection between a station and a switch, a straight-through cable is used. 
The switch fabric circuitry allows full bandwidth simultaneously on multiple ports 
without collisions.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
Station-to-station, switch-to-switch, and station-to-switch connections in Fast Ether-
net all are point-to-point links: They have two physically separate communication 
pathways/channels. In this case, collisions are not physical events, but rather the result 
of an administrative decision to not allow simultaneous Tx and Rx. Therefore, either 
half duplex (subject to the administrative imposition of CSMA/CD) or full duplex (no 
physical collisions occur) is a conﬁguration choice. Most of the time, you run these 
connections in full duplex.
However, station-to-hub connections must account for the bus topology within the 
hub, a collision domain. Hence, this connection can only run half duplex and is subject 
to CSMA/CD because of the physical nature of the structure. 
Can a 100-Mbps technology allow 200 Mbps of trafﬁc? 100BASE-TX carries 100 Mbps 
of trafﬁc in half-duplex mode (although some of this is overhead, not user data). But 
100BASE-TX in full-duplex mode can exchange 200 Mbps of trafﬁc (although, again, 
some of this is overhead, not user data). The concept of full duplex will become increas-
ingly important with the desire to increase the speed of Ethernet links. You will learn 
about the 100BASE-TX architecture rules later in this chapter.
100BASE-FX
Why use 100BASE-FX (introduced as part of the 802.3u-1995 standard)? At the time 
copper-based Fast Ethernet was introduced, a ﬁber version was desired for backbone 
applications, connections between ﬂoors and buildings where copper is less desirable, 
and high-noise environments. 100BASE-FX also was positioned as an alternative to 
the then-popular FDDI (100-Mbps dual ﬁber-optic Token Ring). However, the vast 
majority of Fast Ethernet installations today are 100BASE-TX. One reason for the 
relative lack of adoption of 100BASE-FX was the rapidity of the introduction of Giga-
bit Ethernet copper and ﬁber standards, which are now the dominant technology for 
backbone installations, high-speed cross-connects, and general infrastructure needs. 
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously in Chapter 5 and 
are common to both versions of 100-Mbps Fast Ethernet considered in this chapter. 
100BASE-FX uses 4B/5B encoded data with NRZI line encoding. Signals are LED pulses 
on multimode optical ﬁber. NRZI encoding relies on the presence or absence of a tran-
sition in the middle of the timing window to determine the binary value for that bit 
period. 100BASE-FX is synchronous. 
Figure 6-13 illustrates the NRZI encoding examples. (The y-axis is optical power; the 
x-axis is time.)

Figure 6-13 NRZI Encoding Examples
In the encoding examples in Figure 6-13, one timing window is highlighted vertically 
through all four waveform examples. The top waveform has no transition in the center 
of the timing window, so it is interpreted as a binary 0. No transition indicates that a 
binary 0 is present. If the example waveform was all 0s on that line, the signal level 
represented would be either low or high across the waveform. A single 1 was intro-
duced to indicate that 0s could be either level.
The second waveform has a transition in the center of the timing window. A binary 1 
is represented by a transition. It does not matter whether the transition is rising or fall-
ing. Instead of a repeating sequence of the same binary value in the third waveform, 
there is an alternating binary sequence. In this example, it is more obvious that no 
transition indicates a binary 0, and the presence of a transition indicates a binary 1.
The NRZI-encoded, serialized bit stream is ready for transmission using pulsed light. 
Because of cycle time problems related to turning the transmitter completely on and 
off each time, the light is pulsed using low and high power. A logic 0 is represented by 
low power, and a logic 1 is represented by high power.
Table 6-5 summarizes a 100BASE-FX link and the pinouts. A ﬁber pair with either 
(ST) or (SC) connectors most commonly is used.

Figure 6-14 shows an interface-to-interface ﬁber link. The two separate strands of mul-
timode ﬁber are often in the same cable structure, with dual connectors on each end.
Figure 6-14 Fiber Interface-to-Interface Connection
The MAC method treats the link as point-to-point, and ﬁber is intrinsically full duplex 
because of separate Tx and Rx ﬁbers. 100BASE-TX could run in half duplex, but this 
would have length implications (the timing is actually a codeterminant, along with 
attenuation/dispersion/ﬁber properties of length limitations and restrictions on numbers 
of segments). Again, physical collisions between voltages are not an issue—these are 
serial streams of light pulses on an optical ﬁber—but administratively can impose 
CSMA/CD based on not allowing simultaneous Tx and Rx.
Can 100-Mbps ﬁber technology allow 200 Mbps of trafﬁc? Somewhat analogous to 
the separate transmit and receive paths in UTP, there are two such paths in 100BASE-
FX optical ﬁber, and 200 Mbps is possible. 
Fast Ethernet Architecture
Fast Ethernet links generally consist of a connection between the station and a hub or 
switch. Hubs should be thought of as multiport repeaters and count toward the limit 
on repeaters between distant stations. Switches can be thought of as multiport bridges. 
They are subject to the 100m UTP media distance limitation, but they have no limitation 
on daisy-chaining.
Repeaters must be labeled with the word Class followed by a Roman numeral I or II 
inside a circle, indicating Class I or Class II. A Class I repeater can introduce up to 
140 bit-times of latency (delay). Any repeater that changes between one Ethernet imple-
mentation and another (for example, 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX) is a Class I 
repeater. Also assume that any unlabeled repeater is a Class I device. Figure 6-15 illustrates

the maximum collision domain diameter for a Class I repeater for 100BASE-TX. Using 
switches removes these restrictions, and the limiting factor becomes the media-determined 
maximum length between interfaces.
Figure 6-15 Maximum Collision Domain Diameter for a Class I Repeater
A Class II repeater can introduce only a maximum of 92 bit-times of latency. Because 
of the reduced latency, it is possible to have two Class II repeaters in a series, but only 
if the cable between them is very short. Figure 6-16 illustrates the maximum collision 
domain diameter for a Class II repeater for 100BASE-TX. Using switches removes 
these restrictions, and the limiting factor becomes the media-determined maximum 
length between interfaces.
Figure 6-16 Collision Domain Diameter for a Class II Repeater
As with 10-Mbps versions, it is possible to modify some of the architecture rules for 
100-Mbps versions; however, there is virtually no allowance for additional delay. If 
your network is implemented using new high-performance hardware, it is possible that 
some of these limits can be exceeded. For example, if a longer cable is used between 
repeaters, shorter cables would have to be used to each station. Modiﬁcation of the 
architecture rules strongly is discouraged for 100BASE-TX. Refer to the technical tim-
ing descriptions detailed in Clause 29 of the current 802.3 standard and the technical 
information about your hardware performance before attempting it. Any device that

adapts between different Ethernet speeds, such as between 10 Mbps and 100 Mbps, is 
an OSI Layer 2 bridge. It is not possible to adapt between speeds and still be a repeater. 
However, the same device can repeat between ports linked at the same speed. 
A 100BASE-TX UTP cable is about the same as a 10BASE-T cable, except that link 
performance must meet the higher-quality Category 5 or ISO Class D requirements. 
The 100BASE-TX cable between Class II repeaters cannot exceed 5m.
Links operating in full duplex can be substantially longer than what is shown in Table 6-6 
because they are limited only by the capability of the medium to deliver a robust enough 
signal for proper decoding, not the round-trip delay. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd Fast 
Ethernet operating in half duplex. However, half duplex is undesirable because the sig-
naling scheme is inherently full duplex, and forcing half-duplex communications rules 
onto a full-duplex signaling system is not a wise use of resources. 
It is recommended that all links between a station and a hub or switch be conﬁgured 
for autonegotiation, to permit the highest common performance conﬁguration to be 
established with risking misconﬁguration of the link. Disable autonegotiation and 
force connection conﬁgurations only if autonegotiation fails or on certain selected con-
nections. The average station connection should be established by autonegotiation.
Table 6-6 summarizes the architectural rules for Fast Ethernet.

Gigabit, 10-Gb, and Future Ethernet

100BASE-TX links can have unrepeated distances up to 100m. This might seem like a 
long distance, but it typically is used up quickly when wiring an actual building. Hubs 
can solve this distance issue, subject to the restrictions in Table 6-6 because of timing 
considerations. The widespread introduction of switches has made this distance limita-
tion less important. As long as workstations are located within 100m of a switch, the 
100m distance starts over at the switch, which could be connected via another 100m 
to another switch, and so on. Because most Fast Ethernet is switched, these are the 
practical limits between devices. Ring, star, and extended star topologies all are allowed. 
The issue then becomes one of logical topology and data ﬂow, not timing or distance 
limitations.
Gigabit, 10-Gb, and Future Ethernet
Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps) represented a major improvement over legacy Ethernet 
(10 Mbps). Yet the even more rapid progression from Fast Ethernet to Gigabit Ether-
net is testimony to the power of IEEE standards, engineering advances, and market 
forces. Gigabit Ethernet, 1000 Mbps, is a hundredfold increase in network speed 
over the wildly popular 10BASE-T. Although MAC addressing, CSMA/CD, and, 
most important, the frame format from earlier versions of Ethernet are preserved, 
many other aspects of the MAC sublayer, the physical layer, and the medium have 
been changed.
Copper interfaces capable of 10/100/1000 operation are now common. Gigabit switch 
and router ports and blades are becoming routine in wiring closets. More multimode 
and single-mode optical ﬁber is being installed. One major emphasis of Gigabit Ether-
net is optical ﬁber technology, but the need for a copper version—to use existing cable 
plants and to use the ruggedness of copper in user environments—led to a very clever 
scheme to get 1000 Mbps down the same Category 5 UTP used so successfully in 
10-Mbps and 100-Mbps Ethernet. All of the Gigabit technologies are intrinsically 
full duplex. The inexorable forward march of technology continues as standards and 
technologies for 40 Gbps, 100 Gbps, and 160 Gbps currently are being implemented. 
Most dramatic is the evolution of Ethernet from LAN applications only to an end-to-
end LAN, MAN, and WAN technology.
1000-Mbps Versions of Ethernet (Gigabit)
In 1998, the IEEE 802.3z committee adopted 1000BASE-X standard. This standard 
raised the data transmission rate to 1 Gbps full duplex over optical ﬁber, a hundred-
fold increase in speed over 10BASE-T. The 1000BASE-T standard, specifying 1 Gbps 
full duplex over Category 5 or higher UTP, was adopted in 1999.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
Table 6-7 shows the parameters for 1000-Mbps Ethernet operation.
1000BASE-T, 1000BASE-SX, and 1000BASE-LX all share the same timing parameters. 
Note that bit-time at 1000 Mbps = 1 nsec = .001 microseconds = 1 billionth of a sec-
ond. You also need to note that some differences in timing relative to legacy and Fast 
Ethernet now are appearing because of the special issues that arise with such short bit 
and slot times. 
The 1000-Mbps (Gigabit) Ethernet frame has the same format as is used for 10- and 
100-Mbps Ethernet. 1000-Mbps Ethernet has different paths for the process of con-
verting frames to bits on the cable, depending on which implementation is used.
Gigabit Ethernet is a tenfold increase in speed over Fast Ethernet. Just as with Fast 
Ethernet, with this increase in speed comes extra requirements—the bits being sent get 
shorter in duration (1 nanosecond), occur more frequently, and require more careful 
timing. Their transmission also requires frequencies closer to medium bandwidth limi-
tations, and they become more susceptible to noise. In response to these issues of syn-
chronization, bandwidth, and signal-to-noise ratio, Gigabit Ethernet uses two separate 
encoding steps. The basic idea is to use codes—which can be engineered to have desir-
able properties—to represent the user data in a way that is efﬁcient to transmit, includ-
ing synchronization, efﬁcient usage of bandwidth, and improved SNR characteristics.

Bit patterns from the MAC sublayer are converted into symbols, with symbols some-
times controlling information (such as start frame, end frame, and medium idle condi-
tions). The entire frame is broken up into control symbols and data symbols (data code 
groups). All of this extra complexity is necessary to achieve the tenfold increase in net-
work speed over Fast Ethernet. For 1000BASE-T, the ﬁrst part of the encoding uses a 
technique called 8Bit-1Quinary quarter (8B1Q4); the second part of the encoding is 
the actual line encoding speciﬁc to copper, called 4-dimensional 5 level pulse amplitude 
modulation (4D-PAM5). The 8B1Q4 encoding followed by the 4D-PAM5 line encod-
ing provide the synchronization, bandwidth, and SNR characteristics needed to make 
possible the four wire pairs (working in parallel) running full duplex on each wire pair 
simultaneously. For 1000BASE-X, 8-bit/10-bit (8B/10B) encoding (similar to the 4B/
5B concept) is used, followed by the simple NRZ line encoding of light on optical ﬁber.
1000BASE-T
Goals for 1000BASE-T (introduced as 802.3ab-1999 1000BASE-T Gigabit Ethernet 
over twisted-pair) included these:
■Capability to function over existing Category 5 copper cable plants
■Assurance that this cable would work by passing a Category 5e test, which 
most cable can pass after a careful retermination
■Interoperability with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX
■Applications such as building backbones, interswitch links, wiring closet applica-
tions, server farms, and high-end desktop workstations
■Provision of 10x bandwidth of Fast Ethernet, which became very widely installed 
by end users, helping to necessitate more speed upstream in the network
To achieve this speed running over Category 5e copper cable, 1000BASE-T needed 
to use all four pairs of wires. Category 5e cable reliably can carry up to 125 Mbps of 
trafﬁc. Using sophisticated circuitry, full-duplex transmissions on the same wire pair 
allow 250 Mbps per pair; multiplied by four wire pairs, this gives a total of 1000 Mbps 
(1 Gbps). For some purposes, it is helpful to think of these four wire pairs as “lanes” 
over which the data travels simultaneously (to be reassembled carefully at the receiver).
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously in Chapter 5 
and are common to all versions of 1000-Mbps Ethernet considered here.
1000BASE-T uses 8B1Q4 encoding with 4D-PAM5 line encoding on Cat 5e or better 
UTP. Achieving the 1-Gbps rate required use of all four pairs in full-duplex simulta-
neously. This results in a permanent collision on the wire pairs, which is very different 
from the ﬁrst coaxial Ethernet systems. The “permanent” collisions—transmission and 
receipt of data happens in both directions on the same wire at the same time—results

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
in very complex voltage patterns. But using sophisticated integrated circuits, which, 
among other things, use a technique called echo cancellation, works well.
Despite the constant collision of the signals, the system is capable of operating through 
a careful selection of voltage levels and use of Layer 1 forward error correction (FEC).
Figure 6-17 shows the outbound (transmitting [Tx]) 1000BASE-T signal (the y-axis is 
voltage; the x-axis is the time taken from an oscilloscope—voltage is a “differential sig-
nal” measured between two paired wires in one of the four pairs present in UTP cable).
Figure 6-17 Outbound (Tx) 1000BASE-T Signal
Figure 6-18 shows actually 1000BASE-T signal captured with a digital storage oscillo-
scope after several meters of cable. (the y-axis is voltage; the x-axis is time—voltage is 
a “differential signal” measured between two paired wires in one of the four pairs 
present in UTP cable).
Figure 6-18 Actual 1000BASE-T Signal 
It is quite remarkable that the signal can be recovered at all when it is revealed that 
during idle periods, there are nine voltage levels found on the cable, and during data 
transmission periods, there are 17 voltage levels on the cable. Note the complex line 
encoding to begin with. Then, in Figure 6-18, look at the actual signal on the wire with 
constant collisions, as well as attenuation effects and noise. The signal looks analog. 
The key here is that sophisticated circuitry is decoding all of this. However, the system 
is susceptible to cable problems, termination problems, and noise unless standards are 
followed. Gigabit Ethernet works very well if the cabling, termination, and noise 
guidelines are followed.
Table 6-8 summarizes the use of all four pairs in the UTP cable. A, B, C, and D could 
be considered “lanes” of data. The data from the sending station carefully is divided 
into four parallel streams, encoded, transmitted and detected in parallel, and then reas-
sembled into one received bit stream.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
It is especially important to desktop, ofﬁce, and wiring closet applications that there be 
interoperability among Gigabit, Fast, and 10BASE-T Ethernet. This might seem to be a 
hopeless affair. But upon close inspection, note that if the cabling installed in the walls 
tests out (as it often does or easily can be made to by retermination) at Category 5e 
and if all eight wires in the RJ-45 connectors and jacks are connected, the signal paths 
exists for Gigabit, Fast, and 10BASE-T Ethernet to interoperate. Just as 10/100 devices 
emerged in Fast Ethernet, 10/100/1000 interfaces have been developed for interopera-
bility. By using the same frame format, compatible wiring paths, and clever interface 
engineering, it all works well.
For historical reasons, CSMA/CD and half duplex are options on 1000BASE-T. But 
the overwhelming use of 1000BASE-T is full duplex. This is accomplished with sophis-
ticated hybrid circuits that can act as Tx and Rx at the same time for the same wires. 
Before communications can begin, the two link partners must determine which will 
source the master clock and which will use the data stream to recover the slave clock. 
The master clock and slave clock are used as time markers for signal transmission. 
This process usually is determined during autonegotiation, although it can be conﬁg-
ured manually. A number of other parameters also are determined in the same manner, 
including duplex type. Autonegotiation usually determines that a multiport device (a 
switch or hub) should become the master clock. The overall message here is that with 
the 1 nanosecond bit-times, 1 billion bps data transfer rate, and four wire pairs simul-
taneously transmitting and receiving, synchronization is extremely important.
When the topic of 1000BASE-X (1000BASE-SX and 1000BASE-LX) is presented, 
comparisons with 1000BASE-T architecture are included.
1000BASE-SX and 1000BASE-LX 
Gigabit Ethernet over ﬁber is one of the most recommended backbone technologies. Its 
beneﬁts are tremendous:
■1000-Mbps data transfer, which can aggregate groupings of widely deployed 
Fast Ethernet devices
■Noise immunity
■Lack of any ground potential problems between ﬂoors or buildings
■An explosion in 1000BASE-X device options
■Excellent distance characteristics
Gigabit Ethernet over ﬁber originally was introduced in the IEEE 802.3 supplement 
entitled “802.3z-1998 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet.” The only application for 
which 1000BASE-SX and 1000BASE-LX has not caught on as rapidly is the ofﬁce

desktop—1000BASE-TX is considered more “user-proof” in terms of day-to-day wear, 
and 10-/100-/1000-Mbps copper interfaces are common.
The timing, frame format, and transmission were described previously in Chapter 5 
and are common to all versions of 1000-Mbps Ethernet considered here.
1000BASE-X uses 8B/10B encoding converted to NRZ line encoding, with either 
lower-cost short-wavelength 850 nm laser (or sometimes LED) sources and multimode 
optical ﬁber (1000BASE-SX, S for short), or long-wavelength 1310 nm laser sources 
and single-mode optical ﬁber (1000BASE-LX, L for long). 
NRZ encoding relies on the signal level found in the timing window to determine the 
binary value for that bit period. Unlike most of the other encoding schemes described, 
this encoding system is level-driven instead of edge-driven.
In the encoding example in Figure 6-20, one timing window is highlighted vertically 
through all four waveform examples. The top waveform is low across the timing win-
dow. A low signal level represents a binary 0. A single 1 was introduced at the end of 
the waveform to show the other signal level.
Figure 6-20 NRZ Encoding Example
The second waveform is high across the timing window. A high signal level represents 
a binary 1. Again, a single 0 was introduced at the end of the waveform to show the 
other signal level. Instead of a repeating sequence of the same binary value in the third 
waveform, there is an alternating binary sequence. In this example, it is more obvious 
that a low signal level indicates a binary 0 and a high signal indicates a binary 1.

The fourth waveform example is random data. Three of these examples are good 
examples of why this encoding scheme has the potential to cause dc voltage drift on 
copper media. The second example is changing levels each bit period and would not 
suffer from dc voltage drift. It is very easy for a string of the same binary signal to 
cause a dc voltage bias on the cable, which has the potential of causing clocking errors. 
On ﬁber media, this is not an issue.
The NRZ-encoded serialized bit stream is ready for transmission using pulsed light as 
speciﬁed for 1000BASE-SX or 1000BASE-LX. Because of cycle time problems related 
to turning the transmitter completely on and off each time, the light is pulsed using 
low and high power. A logical 0 is represented by low power, and a logical 1 is repre-
sented by high power.
Table 6-9 shows the amazingly simple interface-to-interface interconnection for Gigabit 
Ethernet over ﬁber. SC ﬁber-optic connectors most commonly are used.
Figure 6-21 shows the interface-to-interface connection for 1000BASE-SX. Short-
wavelength laser (or sometimes LED) sources typically are used with multimode 
optical ﬁber.

The MAC method used treats the link as point-to-point, and ﬁber is intrinsically full 
duplex because separate Tx and Rx ﬁbers. Gigabit Ethernet permits a single repeater 
between two stations.
Gigabit Ethernet Architecture
Any device that adapts between different Ethernet speeds, such as between 100 Mbps 
and 1000 Mbps, is an OSI Layer 2 bridge. It is not possible to adapt between speeds 
and still be a repeater. 
Full-duplex links can be substantially longer that what is shown in Tables 6-9 and 6-10 
because they are limited only by the medium, not by the round-trip delay. Gigabit Ether-
net architecture is overwhelmingly station-to-station, station-to-switch, switch-to-switch, 
and switch-to-router connections running at full duplex. 1000BASE-SX is speciﬁed for 
multimode ﬁber. 1000BASE-LX is speciﬁed for multimode and single-mode ﬁber. 
Tables 6-10 and 6-11 show distance limitations for 1000BASE-SX and 1000BASE-LX. 
Because most Gigabit Ethernet is switched, these are the practical limits between devices. 
Daisy-chaining, star, and extended star topologies all are allowed. The issue then 
becomes one of logical topology and data ﬂow, not timing or distance limitations.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
A 1000BASE-T UTP cable is about the same as a 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX cable, 
except that link performance must meet the higher-quality Category 5e or ISO Class D 
(2000) requirements.
As with 10-Mbps and 100-Mbps versions, it is possible to modify some of the architec-
ture rules slightly; however, there is virtually no allowance for additional delay in half 
duplex. Modiﬁcation of the architecture rules strongly is discouraged for 1000BASE-T. 
At 100m, 1000BASE-T is operating close to the edge of the hardware’s capability to 
recover the transmitted signal. Any cabling problems or environmental noise could 
render an otherwise-compliant cable inoperable even at distances that are within the 
speciﬁcation. Refer to the technical timing descriptions in the current 802.3 standard 
and the technical information about your hardware performance before attempting 
any adjustments to the architecture rules.
Links operating in full-duplex links might be longer that what is indicated in Table 6-12 
because they are limited only by the capability of the medium to deliver a robust enough 
signal to decode the signaling; they are not limited by the round-trip delay. It is extremely 
rare to ﬁnd Gigabit Ethernet operating in half duplex. Half duplex is undesirable because 
the signaling scheme is inherently full duplex, and forcing half-duplex communications 
rules onto a full-duplex signaling system is not a wise use of resources. Operating under 
half-duplex rules requires adherence to slot time round-trip delay limitations that 
reduce the effective cable lengths, and there is also a substantial increase in overhead 
introduced by the carrier extension. Furthermore, very few Gigabit repeaters are in 
service, which means that the link is probably between a station and an OSI Layer 2 
bridge, or between two bridges, so the collision domain would end at the bridge anyway.
It is recommended that all links between a station and a switch be conﬁgured for auto-
negotiation, to permit the highest common performance conﬁguration to be established 
without risking misconﬁguration of the link, and to avoid accidental misconﬁguration 
of the other required parameters for proper Gigabit Ethernet operation.

Table 6-12 shows the speed case for half-duplex operation. But because most Gigabit 
Ethernet is switched, it is subject to link-by-link rules shown previously in Tables 6-10 
and 6-11.
10-Gbps Versions of Ethernet
Most recently, in 2002, IEEE 802.3ae was adapted. This standard speciﬁes 10-Gbps 
full-duplex transmission over ﬁber-optic cable. Taken as a whole, the similarities 
between 802.3ae and 802.3 (the original Ethernet) and all of the other varieties of 
Ethernet are remarkable. Metcalfe’s original design has evolved, but it is still very 
apparent in the modern Ethernet. Recently, 10-Gb Ethernet (10GbE) has emerged as 
the latest example of the extensibility of the Ethernet system. Usable for LANs, storage-
area networks (SANs), metropolitan-area networks (MANs), and WANs, 10GbE offers 
exciting new networking possibilities. What is 10GbE, and why should it be used?
Legacy Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and Gigabit Ethernet now dominate the LAN market. 
The next step in the evolution of Ethernet is to move to 10-Gb Ethernet (10GbE, oper-
ating at 10,000,000,000 bps). By maintaining the frame format and other Ethernet 
Layer 2 speciﬁcations, increasing bandwidth needs can be accommodated with the 
low-cost, easily implementable, and easily interoperable 10GbE. 10GbE runs only over 
optical ﬁber media. End-to-end Ethernet networks become possible. 
Because of massive growth in Internet- and intranet-based trafﬁc, and the rapidly increas-
ing use of Gigabit Ethernet, even higher bandwidth interconnections are needed. Internet
service providers (ISPs) and network service providers (NSPs) can use 10GbE to create 
high-speed, low-cost, easily interoperable connections between colocated carrier switches 
and routers. Points of presence (POPs), intranet server farms comprised of Gigabit 
Ethernet servers, digital video studios, SANs, and backbones already are envisaged 
applications.
Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, a major conceptual change comes with 10GbE. Ethernet 
traditionally is thought of as a LAN technology. But 10GbE physical layer standards 
allow both an extension in distance (to 40 km over single-mode ﬁber) and compatibility

with Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) 
networks. Operation at a 40 km distance makes 10GbE a viable MAN technology. 
Compatibility with SONET/SDH networks operating up to OC-192 speeds 
(9.584640 Gps) makes 10GbE a viable WAN technology. 10GbE also might com-
pete with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) for certain applications.
The following summarizes how 10GbE compares to other varieties of Ethernet:
■Frame format is the same, allowing interoperability among all varieties of legacy, 
Fast, Gigabit, and 10-Gb Ethernet, with no reframing or protocol conversions.
■Bit-time now at 0.1 nanoseconds. All other time variables scale accordingly.
■No need for CSMA/CD because only full-duplex ﬁber connections are used.
■IEEE 802.3 sublayers within OSI Layers 1 and 2 that are mostly preserved, with 
a few additions to accommodate 40-km ﬁber links and interoperability with 
SONET/SDH technologies.
■Possibility of ﬂexible, efﬁcient, reliable, relatively low cost end-to-end Ethernet 
networks.
■Capability to run TCP/IP over LANs, MANs, and WANs with one Layer 2 trans-
port method 
The basic standard governing CSMA/CD is IEEE 802.3. An IEEE 802.3 supplement, 
entitled 802.3ae, governs the 10GBASE family. As is typical for new technologies, a 
variety of implementations are being considered, including these:
■10GBASE-SR—Intended for short distances over already-installed multimode 
ﬁber, supports a range between 26 m and 82 m.
■10GBASE-LX4—Uses wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Supports 240 m 
to 300 m over already-installed multimode ﬁber, and 10 km over single-mode ﬁber.
■10GBASE-LR and 10GBASE-ER—Supports 10 km and 40 km over single-mode 
ﬁber.
■10GBASE-SW, 10GBASE-LW, and 10GBASE-EW—Intended to work with 
OC-192/STM SONET/SDH WAN equipment. 
The IEEE 802.3ae task force and the 10-Gb Ethernet Alliance (10 GEA) are working 
to standardize these emerging technologies. 
10-Gb Ethernet (IEEE 802.3ae) was standardized in June 2002. It is a full-duplex 
protocol that uses only ﬁber-optic ﬁber as a transmission medium. The maximum 
transmission distances depend on the type of ﬁber being used. When using single-mode 
ﬁber as the transmission medium, the maximum transmission distance is 40 km (25 miles). 
Some discussions between IEEE members suggest the possibility of standards for 40-Gbps, 
80-Gbps, and even 100-Gbps Ethernet. Given the history of Ethernet, there is no reason

349
to expect that its evolution will cease. The higher speeds and greater transmission dis-
tances that are making Ethernet both a LAN and a MAN protocol are not the only 
additions to the Ethernet standard that we are likely to see. Because ﬁber is being used 
as the transmission medium, the likelihood that an error in the data might occur during 
the passage of the Ethernet packet across the network is very low, much lower than in 
the original Ethernet. On a network with a very low error rate, it makes sense to trans-
mit larger packets of data.
The upper limit on the amount of data that can be carried in an Ethernet packet (a 
frame) is 1500 bytes. Sending more data than that in a frame would make it an invalid 
Ethernet frame and cause the network to discard it. This has been the standard since 
Ethernet was created. Given a low likelihood of errors on a network, large ﬁles could 
be moved over the network more efﬁciently if a larger amount of data could be carried 
in each frame. The reason for this is that it takes time for computers to generate and to 
process Ethernet headers and trailers. Each Ethernet frame must have a header and a 
trailer. For example, if six times as much data could be sent per frame, there would be 
fewer frames (only one sixth as many) needed to carry all the data in a ﬁle. This means 
that fewer headers and trailers would have to be generated by the transmitter and pro-
cessed by the receiver. The result is a shorter amount of time needed to move a large 
ﬁle over a network between two computers. WANs that use ﬁber as their transmission 
medium routinely transmit large data packets. 
For this reason, especially when multigigabit LANs are connected to WANs, it is likely 
that we will see the use of Jumbo Ethernet frames. A Jumbo frame is any Ethernet frame 
that is carrying more than 1500 bytes of data. The proposed upper limit for the amount 
of data carried in a Jumbo frame is about 9,000 bytes. Jumbo frames are not currently 
a part of the new IEEE 802.3ae standard. However, it is very likely that some vendors 
of Ethernet networking equipment will allow Jumbo frames to be carried on Ethernet 
networks built using only their equipment. This might force the IEEE 802.3 committee 
to make support for larger frame sizes an option in new multigigabit standards.

Amazingly, 10GbE uses the same frame format (with a few special case exceptions) as 
10-, 100-, and 1000-Mbps Ethernet.
10GbE Media, Connections, and Architecture
10-Gb Ethernet is a tenfold increase in speed over Gigabit Ethernet. Just as with Gigabit 
Ethernet, with this increase in speed comes extra requirements—the bits being sent get 
shorter in duration (1 ns), occur more frequently, and require more careful timing. In 
addition, their transmission requires frequencies closer to medium bandwidth limitations 
and they become more susceptible to noise. In response to these issues of synchroniza-
tion, bandwidth, and SNR, two separate encoding steps are used by 10-Gb Ethernet. 
The basic idea is to use codes—which can be engineered to have desirable properties—
to represent the user data in a way that is efﬁcient to transmit, including synchronization, 
efﬁcient usage of bandwidth, and improved SNR characteristics. 
Bit patterns from the MAC sublayer are converted into symbols, with symbols some-
times controlling information (such as start frame, end frame, and medium idle condi-
tions). The entire frame is broken up into control symbols and data symbols (data code 
groups). All of this extra complexity is necessary to achieve the tenfold increase in net-
work speed over Gigabit Ethernet. 8B/10B encoding (similar to the 4B/5B concept) is 
used, followed by several different types of line encoding on the optical ﬁber.

Figure 6-23 represents what happens to the 8B-10B before it is line-encoded. 10-Gb 
Ethernet uses a variety of complex encodings before line encoding, including 8B/10B 
and 64B/66B. Bits from these codes then are converted to line signals: low power light 
for binary 0 and higher power light for binary 1. Complex serial bit streams are used 
for all versions of 10GbE except for 10GBASE-LX4, which uses wide wavelength-
division multiplexing (WWDM) to multiplex 4-bit simultaneous bit streams as four 
wavelengths of light launched into the ﬁber at one time. 
Figure 6-23 How 10GbE Converts MAC Frames to Four Lanes of Bits
Figure 6-23 shows how 10GbE converts MAC frames to four lanes of bits for parallel 
transmission on four wire pairs of UTP or as a bit stream that is then serialized for 
laser transmission on single-mode ﬁber.
Figure 6-24 represents the particular case of using four slightly different-colored laser 
sources. Upon receipt from the medium, the optical signal stream is demultiplexed into 
four separate optical signal streams. The four optical signal streams then are converted 
back into four electronic bit streams as they travel in approximately the reverse pro-
cess back up through the sublayers to the MAC sublayer.
Currently, most 10GbE products are in the form of modules (line cards) for addition to 
high-end switches and routers. As the 10GbE technologies evolve, an increasing diver-
sity of signaling components can be expected. As optical technologies involve, improved 
transmitters and receivers will be incorporated into these products, further taking 
advantage of modularity. All 10GbE varieties use optical-ﬁber media. Fiber types 
include 10µm single-mode ﬁber, and 50µm and 62.5 µm multimode ﬁbers. A range of 
ﬁber attenuation and dispersion characteristics are supported, but they limit operating 
distances.

SC ﬁber optic connectors most commonly are used. Because optical ﬁber is the medium 
used by 10GbE, typically a ﬁber pair connects Tx for device 1 to Rx for device 2, and 
vice versa. The primary devices connecting currently via 10GbE are high-end modular 
switches and routers. Table 6-14 lists the pinout options for 10GbE.
10-Gb Ethernet is available in full-duplex mode only and runs only over optical ﬁber. 
Hence, collisions are nonexistent and CSMA/CD is unnecessary. 
As 10GbE standards and products evolve, a wide range of architectures and applica-
tion guidelines is becoming possible. Most important to consider is that the addition of 
10GbE, with its LAN, SAN, MAN, and WAN capabilities, enables network engineers 
to consider very sophisticated end-to-end Ethernet networks. LAN, SAN, MAN, and 
WAN topologies using Gigabit Ethernet all are being implemented. 
10-Gb Ethernet is supported only over ﬁber-optic media. Support is available for 62.5 µm
and 50 µm multimode ﬁber, as well as 10 µm single-mode ﬁber. Even though support is 
limited to ﬁber-optic media, some of the maximum cable lengths are surprisingly short. 
No repeater is deﬁned for 10-Gb Ethernet because half duplex explicitly is not supported.

As with 10-Mbps, 100,-Mbps and 1000-Mbps versions, it is possible to modify some 
of the architecture rules slightly. Possible architecture adjustments are related to signal 
loss and distortion along the medium. Because of dispersion of the signal and other 
issues, the light pulse becomes undecipherable beyond certain distances. Refer to the 
technical timing and spectral requirements in the current 802.3 standard, as well as 
the technical information about your hardware performance, before attempting any 
adjustments to the architecture rules.
Table 6-15 shows the 10-Gb Ethernet implementations. Both R and W speciﬁcations 
are covered by each appropriate entry (for example, 10GBASE-E covers both 
10GBASE-ER and 10GBASE-EW). 
Note the versatility of 10GbE. A diverse set of ﬁber types and laser sources can be used 
to achieve not only LAN, but also MAN and WAN distances.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
The Future of Ethernet
As the last several sections have documented, Ethernet has gone through an evolution 
from legacy to Fast to Gigabit to multigigabit technologies. Although other LAN tech-
nologies are still in place (legacy installations), Ethernet dominates new LAN installa-
tions—so much so that some have referred to Ethernet as the LAN “dial tone.” Ethernet 
is now the standard for horizontal, vertical, and interbuilding connections. In fact, 
recently developing versions of Ethernet are blurring the distinction between LANs, 
MANs, and WANs in terms of geographic distance covered as part of one network.
Figure 6-25 illustrates the expanding scope of Ethernet.
Figure 6-25 Ethernet’s Expanding Scope
Although Gigabit Ethernet is now widely available and 10-Gb products becoming 
more available, the IEEE and the 10-Gb Ethernet Alliance currently have released 
40-Gbps, 100-Gbps, and even 160-Gbps standards. Which technologies actually are 
adopted will depend on a number of factors, including the rate of maturation of the 
technologies and standards, the rate of adoption in the market, and cost.
Proposals for Ethernet arbitration schemes other than CSMA/CD have been made. 
But the problem of collisions, so fundamental to physical bus topologies of 10BASE5, 
10BASE2, 10BASE-T, and 100BASE-TX hubs, are no longer so common. Use of UTP 
and optical ﬁber, both of which have separate Tx and Rx paths, and the decreasing 
costs of switched instead of hubbed connections, make single shared-media, half-duplex 
media connections much less important.

Ethernet Switching
355
The future of networking media is threefold: 
■Copper (up to 1000 Mbps, perhaps more)
■Wireless (approaching 100 Mbps, perhaps more)
■Optical ﬁber (currently at 10,000 Mbps and soon to be more)
Unlike copper and wireless media, in which certain physical and practical limitations 
on the highest-frequency signals that can be transmitted are being approached, the 
bandwidth limitation on optical ﬁber is extremely large and is not a limiting factor for 
the foreseeable future. In ﬁber systems, the electronics technology (such as emitters 
and detectors) and the ﬁber-manufacturing processes most limit the speed. Therefore, 
upcoming developments in Ethernet likely will be heavily weighted toward laser light 
sources and single-mode optical ﬁber. 
When Ethernet was slower, half duplex (subject to collisions and a “democratic” process 
for prioritization) was not considered to have the quality of service (QoS) capabilities 
required to handle certain types of trafﬁc. This included such things as IP telephony 
and video multicast. 
However, the full-duplex, high-speed Ethernet technologies that now dominate the 
market are proving to be sufﬁcient at supporting even QoS-intensive applications. This 
makes the potential applications of Ethernet even wider. Ironically, end-to-end QoS 
capability helped drive a push for ATM to the desktop and to the WAN in the mid-
1990s, but now Ethernet, not ATM, approaching this goal.  
At 30 years old, Ethernet technologies continue to grow and have a very bright future.
Ethernet Switching
As more nodes are added to an Ethernet physical segment, the contention for the 
medium increases. The addition of more nodes increases the demands on the available 
bandwidth and places additional loads on the medium. With the additional trafﬁc, the 
probability of collisions increases, resulting in more retransmissions. A solution to the 
problem is to break the large segment into parts and separate it using Catalyst switches. 
This isolates these newly segmented sections into isolated collision domains. This reduces 
the number of collisions and increases the reliability of the network. 
Bridging and switching are technologies that decrease congestion in LANs by reducing 
trafﬁc and increasing bandwidth. LAN switches and bridges, operating at Layer 2 of 
the OSI reference model, forward frames based on the MAC addresses to perform the 
switching function. If the Layer 2 MAC address is unknown, the device ﬂoods the 
frame in an attempt to reach the desired destination. LAN switches and bridges also 
1102.book  Page 355  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

356
Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
forward all broadcast frames. The result could be storms of trafﬁc being looped end-
lessly through the network. The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a loop-prevention 
protocol; it is a technology that enables switches to communicate with each other to 
discover physical loops in the network. 
The sections that follow introduce Layer 2 bridging, Layer 2 switching, switching 
modes, and the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).
Layer 2 Bridging
A bridge is a Layer 2 device designed to create two or more LAN segments, each of 
which is a separate collision domain. In other words, bridges were designed to create 
more usable bandwidth. The purpose of a bridge is to ﬁlter trafﬁc on a LAN to keep 
local trafﬁc local, yet allow connectivity to other parts (segments) of the LAN for traf-
ﬁc that is directed there. To ﬁlter or selectively deliver network trafﬁc, bridges build 
tables of all MAC addresses located on a network segment and other networks, and 
map them to associated ports. The process is as follows:
■If data comes along the network medium, a bridge compares the destination 
MAC address carried by the data to MAC addresses contained in its tables. 
■If the bridge determines that the destination MAC address of the data is from the 
same network segment as the source, it does not forward the data to other seg-
ments of the network. This process is known as ﬁltering. By performing this 
process, bridges signiﬁcantly can reduce the amount of trafﬁc between network 
segments by eliminating unnecessary trafﬁc.
■If the bridge determines that the destination MAC address of the data is not from 
the same network segment as the source, it forwards the data to the appropriate 
segment.
■If the destination MAC address is unknown to the bridge, the bridge broadcasts 
the data to all devices on a network except the one on which it was received. The 
process is known as ﬂooding.
Generally, a bridge has only two ports and divides a collision domain into two parts. 
All decisions made by a bridge are based on MAC addresses or Layer 2 addressing, 
and do not affect the logical or Layer 3 addressing. Thus, a bridge divides a collision 
domain but not a logical or broadcast domain. No matter how many bridges are in a 
network, unless a device such as a router works on Layer 3 addressing, all of the net-
work will share the same logical (broadcast) address space. A bridge will create more 
(and smaller) collision domains but will not add broadcast domains. Because every 
device on the network must pay attention to broadcasts, bridges always forward them. 
Therefore, all segments in a bridged environment are considered to be in the same 
broadcast domain.

Layer 2 Switching
LAN switches are essentially multiport bridges that use microsegmentation to reduce 
the number of collisions in a LAN and increase the bandwidth. LAN switches also 
support features such as full-duplex communication and multiple simultaneous con-
versations. Figure 6-30 shows a LAN with three workstations, a LAN switch, and the 
LAN switch’s address table. The LAN switch has four interfaces (or network connec-
tions). Stations A and C are connected to the switch’s Interface 3, and Station B is on 
Interface 4. As indicated in Figure 6-26, Station A needs to transmit data to Station B. 
Figure 6-26 LAN Switch Operation
Remember that as this trafﬁc goes through the network, the switch operates at Layer 2, 
meaning that the switch can look at the MAC layer address. When Station A transmits 
and the switch receives the frames, the switch assesses the trafﬁc as it goes through to dis-
cover the source MAC address and store it in the address table, as shown in Figure 6-27.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
As the trafﬁc goes through the switch, an entry is made in the address table identifying 
the source station and the interface that it is connected to on the switch. The switch 
now knows where Station A is connected. When that frame of data is in the switch, it 
ﬂoods to all ports because the destination station is unknown, as shown in Figure 6-28.
Figure 6-28 Flooding Data to All Switch Ports
After the address entry is made in the table, however, a response comes back from 
Station B to Station A. The switch now knows that Station B is connected to Inter-
face 4, as shown in Figure 6-29.
Figure 6-29 Responding to the Flooding Message
The data is transmitted into the switch, but notice that the switch does not ﬂood the 
trafﬁc this time. The switch sends the data out of only Interface 3 because it knows 
where Station A is on the network, as shown in Figure 6-30.

The original transmission indicated where that MAC address came from, enabling the 
switch to deliver trafﬁc in the network more efﬁciently. 
Microsegmentation
As technology improved, it became possible to build bridges with more capability. 
Naturally, the ultimate goal is to have only one node on each port of a bridge. This 
would reduce the collision domains so that collisions would be nearly nonexistent. A 
switch does exactly that and is simply a bridge with many ports. These small physical 
segments are called microsegments.
Microsegmentation facilitates the creation of a dedicated segment and provides dedi-
cated bandwidth to each user on the network. Each user receives instant access to the 
full bandwidth and does not have to contend for available bandwidth with other users. 
This means that pairs of devices on the same switch can communicate in parallel with 
a minimum number of collisions. Microsegmentation reduces collisions in a network 
and effectively increases the capacity for each station connected to the network. 
In addition to faster microprocessors and memory, two other technological advances 
made switches possible. Content Addressable Memory (CAM) is memory that essentially 
works backward compared to conventional memory. Entering data into the memory 
returns the associated address. Using CAM allows a switch to directly ﬁnd the port 
that is associated with a MAC address without using search algorithms. An application-
speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) is a device consisting of undedicated logic gates that 
can be programmed to perform functions at logic speeds. Operations that might have 
been done in software now can be done in hardware using an ASIC. The use of these 
technologies greatly reduced the delays caused by software processing and enabled a 
switch to keep pace with the data demands of many microsegments and high bit rates.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
Full-Duplex Transmission
Another function of LAN switching that dramatically improves bandwidth is full-
duplex transmission, which effectively doubles the amount of bandwidth between 
nodes. Full-duplex transmission between stations is achieved by using point-to-point 
Ethernet connections. This feature can be important, for example, between high-band-
width consumers, such as a connection between a switch and a server. Full-duplex 
transmission provides a collision-free transmission environment. Because both nodes 
can transmit and receive at the same time, there are no negotiations for bandwidth. 
In 10-Mbps connections, for example, full-duplex transmission provides 10 Mb of 
transmit capacity and 10 Mb of receive capacity, for effectively 20 Mb of capacity on 
a single connection. Likewise, a 100-Mbps connection offers effectively 200 Mbps of 
throughput, as illustrated in Figure 6-31. Full-duplex communication also supports 
two data transmission paths, with speeds up to 1 Gbps.
Figure 6-31 Switching Technology: Full Duplex
Latency
Latency, sometimes called propagation delay, is the time that a frame, or packet, of 
data takes to travel from the source station or node to its ﬁnal destination on the net-
work. A wide variety of conditions can cause delays as a frame travels from source to 
destination:
■Media delays caused by the ﬁnite speed that signals can travel through the physi-
cal media. 
■Circuit delays caused by the electronics that process the signal along the path. 
■Software delays caused by the decisions that software must make to implement 
switching and protocols. 
■Delays caused by the content of the frame and where in the frame switching deci-
sions can be made. For example, a device cannot route a frame to a destination 
until the destination MAC address has been read. 
Latency is the time delay between when a frame ﬁrst starts to leave the source device 
and when the ﬁrst part of the frame reaches its destination.

Switch Modes
How the content of a frame is switched to the destination port is a trade-off of latency 
and reliability. The three modes of switching—store-and-forward, cut-through, and 
fragment-free switching—offer different performance and latency. 
Store-and-Forward Switching
In store-and-forward switching, the switch reads the entire frame of data, checks the 
frame for errors, decides where it needs to go, and then sends it on its way. Figure 6-32 
illustrates the operation of store-and-forward switching. The obvious trade-off here 
is that it takes the switch longer to read the entire frame. As it reads the entire frame, 
however, it detects any errors on that frame. If the frame is in error, the frame is not 
forwarded and is discarded. Although cut-through switching is faster, it offers no error 
detection. The latency introduced by store-and-forward switching is usually not a sig-
niﬁcant issue.
Figure 6-32 Store-and-Forward Switching
Cut-Through Switching
In cut-through switching, the switch reads the beginning of the frame up to the destina-
tion MAC address as the trafﬁc ﬂows through the switch and “cuts through” to its des-
tination without continuing to read the rest of the frame, as illustrated in Figure 6-33.
Cut-through switching decreases the latency of the transmission. However, cut-through 
switching has no error detection.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
Figure 6-33  Cut-Through Switching
Fragment-Free Switching
Fragment-free switching is a modiﬁed form of cut-through switching. Fragment-free 
switching ﬁlters out collision fragments, which are the majority of packet errors, before 
forwarding begins. Fragment-free switching waits until the received packet has been 
determined not to be a collision fragment before forwarding the packet. 
When to Use Each Switching Mode
When using cut-through and fragment-free modes, both the source port and the desti-
nation port must be operating at the same bit rate to keep the frame intact. This is 
called synchronous switching. If the bit rates are not the same, the frame must be stored 
at one bit rate before it is sent out at the other bit rate. This is known as asynchronous
switching. Store-and-forward mode must be used for asynchronous switching. Asym-
metric switching provides switched connections between ports of unlike bandwidths, 
such as a combination of 100 Mbps and 1000 Mbps. Asymmetric switching is opti-
mized for client/server trafﬁc ﬂows in which multiple clients simultaneously communi-
cate with a server, requiring more bandwidth dedicated to the server port to prevent a 
bottleneck at that port.
Introduction to the Spanning Tree Protocol
When multiple switches are connected, there is a possibility of creating a loop where 
there is no clear path from source to destination. If switches are arranged in a simple 
hierarchical tree, no loops will occur, as shown in Figure 6-34.

Chapter 6: Ethernet Technologies and Ethernet Switching
In Figure 6-35, the following steps are occurring:
1. Host 1 broadcasts.
2. SWA and SWB receive the frame. 
3. SWA forwards to SWB.
4. SWB forwards to SWA.
5. Each switch now begins to see multiple frames of the same broadcast, thus 
resulting in routing loops. 
To counteract the possibility of loops, switches are provided with a protocol for them 
to talk with each other to resolve the condition. A switch sends special messages called 
bridge protocol data units (BPDUs) out all its ports to let other switches know of its 
existence, as shown in Figures 6-36 and 6-37. The switches use a spanning tree algo-
rithm (STA) to resolve and shut down the redundant paths. The process of shutting 
down a port is called blocking. The result of resolving and eliminating the loops is a 
logical hierarchical tree created with no loops. However, the alternate paths are still 
available, in case they are needed. The protocol used to resolve and eliminate loops is 
known as the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). This creates another switch and bridge 
operation mode known as loop-avoidance mode.

Figure 6-37 BPDU Protocol Layout
Consequently, switches have ﬁve operating modes:
■Blocking—A port in blocking state sends and listens to BPDUs but does not for-
ward frames. By default, all ports are in blocking state when the switch is turned on.
■Listening—In listening state, a port listens to the BPDUs to make sure there are 
no loops on the network. No frames are forwarded in this state.
■Learning—In this state, a port learns MAC addresses and builds a address table, 
but it does not forward frames.
■Forwarding—A port in the forwarding state forwards frames. BPDUs are sent 
and listened to.
■Disabled—A port in the disabled state does not participate in the operation of 
STP. Therefore, it does not listen to BPDUs or forward frames.
Figure 6-38 illustrates some of the port states and operating modes in a switched net-
work using STP.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■Several types of Ethernet exist: Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 
10-Gb Ethernet. Each type is associated with a different transfer rate.
■Ethernet uses carrier sense multiple access collision detect (CSMA/CD).
■10-Mbps Ethernet operates within the timing limits offered by a series of no 
more than ﬁve segments separated by no more than four repeaters.
■Switches can provide dedicated access to improve shared LAN technologies. 
■A switch segments a LAN into microsegments. Microsegmentation reduces the 
number of collisions to a minimum and increases the effective bandwidth.
■Switches achieve high-speed transfer by reading the destination Layer 2 MAC 
address of the frame packet.

Key Terms
369
cut-through switching
A packet-switching approach that streams data through a 
switch so that the leading edge of a packet exits the switch at the output port before 
the packet ﬁnishes entering the input port. A device using cut-through packet switch-
ing reads, processes, and forwards packets as soon as the destination address is looked 
up and the outgoing port is determined. See also store-and-forward switching.
encoding
Process by which bits are represented by voltages.
fragment-free switching
Switching that ﬁlters out collision fragments, which are the 
majority of packet errors, before forwarding begins.
latency
Delay between the time when a device receives a frame and the time when 
that frame is forwarded out the destination port.
Manchester encoding
Digital encoding scheme, used by IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet, in 
which a mid–bit-time transition is used for clocking; a 1 is denoted by a high level dur-
ing the ﬁrst half of the bit time.
microsegmentation
The division of a network into smaller segments, usually with 
the intention of increasing aggregate bandwidth to network devices.
NRZ (nonreturn to zero)
Signals that maintain constant voltage levels with no signal 
transitions (no return to a 0V level) during a bit interval.
NRZI (nonreturn to zero inverted)
Signal that maintains constant voltage levels with 
no signal transitions (no return to a 0V level). It interprets the presence of data at the 
beginning of a bit interval as a signal transition and interprets the absence of data as 
no transition.
SNR (signal-to-noise ratio)

A packet-switching technique in which frames are pro-
cessed completely before being forwarded out the appropriate port. This processing 
includes calculating the CRC and checking the destination address. In addition, frames 
must be stored temporarily until network resources (such as an unused link) are avail-
able to forward the message. 
STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
Bridge protocol that uses the spanning tree algorithm, 
enabling a learning bridge dynamically to work around loops in a network topology 
by creating a spanning tree. Bridge exchange BPDU messages with other bridges to

Chapter 7
TCP/IP Protocol Suite and 
IP Addressing
This chapter presents an overview of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol 
(TCP/IP) protocol suite. It starts with the history and future of TCP/IP. Then it compares 
the TCP/IP protocol model to the OSI model, identifying and describing each layer of the 
TCP/IP protocol suite and how it relates to the Internet architecture. TCP/IP is covered in 
more detail in Chapter 9, “TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer.”
This chapter also discusses IP addressing in depth. This includes how to convert decimal 
and binary addresses and how to identify the different classes of IP addresses—Class A, 
B, C, D, and E. IPv4, which has been the standard by which IP addresses have been assigned 
for years, is being replaced by a much more advanced IP addressing scheme called IPv6. 
This chapter describes and compares IPv4 and IPv6.
Be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and PhotoZooms, 
which you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Introduction to TCP/IP
The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) created the TCP/IP reference model, shown in 
Figure 7-1, because it wanted a network that could survive any conditions. To illustrate 
further, imagine a world criss-crossed by different kinds of connections—wires, micro-
waves, optical ﬁbers, and satellite links. Then imagine a need for data to be transmitted, 
regardless of the condition of any particular node or network on the internetwork. The 
DoD wants its packets to get through every time, under any conditions, from any one 
point to any other point. It was this very difﬁcult design problem that brought about the 
creation of the TCP/IP model, which has since become the standard on which the Internet 
has grown.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Figure 7-1 TCP/IP Protocol Suite Layers
In reading about the TCP/IP model layers, keep in mind the original intent of the 
Internet; it will help explain why certain things are as they are. The TCP/IP model has 
four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the Internet layer, and the network 
access layer. It is important to note that some of the layers in the TCP/IP model have 
the same names as layers in the OSI model. Do not confuse the layer functions of the 
two models. The layer numbers are different, so the functions Layer 2 performs in the OSI 
model might not be the same as Layer 2 in the TCP/IP model. For example, in the 
OSI model, Layer 3 is IP, just as Layer 2 in the TCP/IP model is IP. Another case is 
the TCP/UDP functions at Layer 4 (the transport layer) in the OSI model and Layer 3 (the 
transport layer) in the TCP/IP model.
The present version of TCP/IP is old. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) was standard-
ized in September 1981. In 1992 the standardization of a new generation of Internet 
Protocol (IP), often called IPng, was supported by the Internet Engineering Task Force 
(IETF). IPng is now called Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). IPv6, shown in Figure 7-2, 
has not yet gained wide implementation, but it has already been released by most ven-
dors of networking equipment and will become the dominant standard in the future.

Application Layer
TCP/IP was designed with a high-level protocol layer that includes OSI session, presen-
tation, and application layer details. The application layer, shown in Figure 7-3, handles 
high-level protocols and issues of representation, encoding, and dialog control.
Figure 7-3 TCP/IP Application Layer Protocols
The TCP/IP protocol suite combines all application-related issues into one layer and 
ensures that this data is properly packaged for the next layer. TCP/IP includes not only 
Internet and transport layer speciﬁcations (such as IP and TCP) but also speciﬁcations 
for common applications. TCP/IP has protocols to support ﬁle transfer, e-mail, and 
remote login, including the following applications:
■Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)—The underlying protocol used by the 
World Wide Web. HTTP deﬁnes how messages are formatted and transmitted 
and what actions web servers and browsers should take in response to various 
commands.
■Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)—A connectionless service that uses User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP). TFTP is used on the router to transfer conﬁguration 
ﬁles and Cisco IOS images and to transfer ﬁles between systems that support 
TFTP. It is useful in some LANs because it operates faster than FTP in a stable 
environment.

■File Transfer Protocol (FTP)—A reliable, connection-oriented service that uses 
TCP to transfer ﬁles between systems that support FTP. It supports bidirectional 
binary ﬁle and ASCII ﬁle transfers.
■Network File System (NFS)—A distributed ﬁle system protocol suite developed 
by Sun Microsystems that allows remote ﬁle access across a network.
■Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)—Governs the transmission of e-mail over 
computer networks. It does not provide support for transmission of data other 
than plain text.
■Terminal emulation (Telnet)—Provides the capability to remotely access another 
computer. It lets a user log into an Internet host and execute commands. A Telnet 
client is called a local host; a Telnet server is called a remote host.
■Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)—A protocol that provides a 
means to monitor and control network devices and to manage conﬁgurations, 
statistics collection, performance, and security.
■Domain Name System (DNS)—A system used on the Internet to translate names 
of domains and their publicly advertised network nodes into IP addresses.
Transport Layer
The transport layer provides transport services from the source host to the destination 
host. It constitutes a logical connection between the network’s endpoints: the sending 
host and the receiving host. Transport protocols, shown in Figure 7-4, segment and 
reassemble data that upper-layer applications send, into the same data stream between 
endpoints. The transport layer data stream provides end-to-end transport services, 
sometimes called end-to-end services.

The transport layer data stream is a logical connection between a network’s endpoints. 
Using UDP, the transport layer’s primary duty is to transport data from source to desti-
nation. End-to-end control, provided by sliding windows and reliability in sequencing 
numbers and acknowledgments, is the primary duty of the transport layer when using 
TCP. The transport layer deﬁnes end-to-end connectivity between host applications. 
Transport services using TCP include all of the following services, whereas using UDP 
provides only the ﬁrst two:
■Segmenting upper-layer application data
■Sending segments from one end device to another end device
■Establishing end-to-end operations
■Flow control provided by sliding windows
■Reliability provided by sequence numbers and acknowledgments
The transport layer assumes that it can use the network as a “cloud” to send data packets 
from the sender source to the receiver destination, as shown in Figure 7-5. The cloud 
deals with issues such as which of several paths is best for a given route, as shown in 
Figure 7-6.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Internet Layer
In the OSI reference model, the network layer isolates the upper-layer protocols from 
the details of the underlying network and manages the connections across the network. 
IP is normally described as the TCP/IP network layer. Because of TCP/IP’s internet-
working emphasis, this is commonly called the Internet layer in the TCP/IP model (see 
Figure 7-7). All upper- and lower-layer communications travel through IP as they are 
passed through the TCP/IP protocol stack. The purpose of the Internet layer is to send 
packets from a device using the correct protocol that functions at this layer. Best path 
determination and packet switching occur at this layer. Think of it in terms of the postal 
system. When a letter is mailed, it doesn’t matter how it gets there (there are various 
possible routes), but it is important that it arrives.
Figure 7-7 TCP/IP Internet Layer Protocols
Several protocols operate at the TCP/IP Internet layer:
■IP—Provides connectionless, best-effort delivery routing of packets. It is not con-
cerned with the packets’ content. Instead, it looks for a way to move the packets 
to their destination.
■Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)—Provides control and messaging 
capabilities.
■Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)—Determines the data link layer addresses 
(Media Access Control [MAC] addresses) for known IP addresses.
■Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)—Determines IP addresses when 
data link layer addresses (MAC addresses) are known.
IP performs the following operations:
■Deﬁning a packet and an addressing scheme

■Transferring data between the Internet layer and the network access layer
■Routing packets to remote hosts
Finally, to clarify terminology, IP is sometimes referred to as an unreliable protocol. 
This does not mean that IP does not accurately deliver data across a network; it simply 
means that IP does not perform error checking and correction. That function is handled 
by upper-layer protocols from the transport or application layer.
Network Access Layer
The network access layer, shown in Figure 7-8, is also called the host-to-network layer. 
It is the layer that is concerned with all the issues that an IP packet requires to make a 
physical link to the network medium. It includes the LAN and WAN technology details 
and all the details contained in the OSI physical and data link layers.
Figure 7-8 TCP/IP Network Access Layer Protocols
Software applications and drivers that are designed for individual pieces of hardware, 
such as Ethernet or Token Ring network interface cards (NICs), ISDN, or modem cards, 
often handle the network access layer. This causes confusion for users because a wide 
variety of protocols are deﬁned by other standards that reside at the network access 
layer. The Internet and transport layer protocols (IP, TCP, and UDP) are much more 
quickly recognized, as are the application protocols (SMTP, HTTP, and FTP), as being 
part of TCP/IP.
Network access layer functions include mapping IP addresses to physical hardware 
addresses and encapsulating IP packets into frames. Based on the hardware type of the

network interface, the network access layer deﬁnes the connection with the physical 
network medium.
A good example of network access layer conﬁguration is setting up a Windows system 
using a third-party NIC. Depending on the version of Windows, the operating system 
automatically detects the NIC, and the proper drivers are installed. If an older version 
of Windows is being used, the user must specify the network card driver. The card 
manufacturer supplies these drivers on disks or CD-ROMs.

Figure 7-9 compares the OSI model and the TCP/IP model.
Figure 7-9 Comparing the TCP/IP Model to the OSI Model
Notice that the models have similarities and differences:
■Similarities
— Both have layers.
— Both have application layers, although they include very different services.
— Both have comparable transport and network layers.
— Packet-switched (not circuit-switched) technology is assumed.
— Networking professionals need to know both.
■Differences
— TCP/IP combines the presentation and session layers into its application 
layer.
— TCP/IP combines the OSI data link and physical layers into its network 
access layer.
— TCP/IP appears simpler because it has fewer layers.

Introduction to TCP/IP
383
— The TCP/IP transport layer using UDP does not always guarantee reliable 
delivery of packets, as the transport layer in the OSI model does.
TCP/IP protocols are the standards around which the Internet developed, so the TCP/
IP model gains credibility just because of its protocols. In contrast, networks typically 
aren’t built on the OSI protocol; the OSI reference model is used as a guide for under-
standing the communication process.
Internet Architecture
Although the Internet is complex, some basic ideas underlie its operation. This section 
investigates the basic architecture of the Internet—a deceptively simple idea that, when 
repeated on a large scale, enables nearly instantaneous worldwide data communications 
between anyone, anywhere, at any time. In Figure 7-10, X and Y represent computers 
that are connected and that can communicate with each other from across the world.
Figure 7-10 Routers Connecting Two Networks
One limitation of LANs is that they do not scale
■Beyond a certain number of stations
■Beyond a certain geographic separation
Astonishing progress is being made in the number of stations that can be efﬁciently 
attached to a hierarchical LAN, and there have been advances in technologies such as 
Metro Optical and Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. However, ultimately 
stations must make recourse to a long-distance, WAN-like, packet-switching network.
One assumption of the Internet’s architecture is that the details of host computers, and 
the LANs on which they reside, are separate from the details of getting messages from 
one network to another.
One approach to the big-picture architecture for the Internet was to focus on the appli-
cation layer interactions between the source and destination computers and any inter-
mediate computers. Identical instances of an application, put on all the computers in 
the network, could facilitate delivery of messages across the large network. However, 
this does not scale well. New software functionality would require new applications 
to be installed on every computer in the network; new hardware functionality would

require modifying the software. Failure of an intermediate computer or its application 
would break the chain on which the messages are passed.
Instead, the Internet uses the principle of network layer interconnection. Using the OSI 
model as an example, the goal is to build the network’s functionality in independent 
modules. The desire is to allow a diversity of LAN technologies at Layers 1 and 2. You 
want to allow a diversity of applications functioning at Layers 5, 6, and 7. However, 
you want a system that hides the details of the lower and upper layers, allowing inter-
mediate networking devices to relay trafﬁc without having to bother with the details of 
the LAN (best administered locally, and the network envisioned will be global) or the 
applications generating network trafﬁc.
This leads to the concept of internetworking—building networks of networks. A net-
work of networks is called an internet (with a lowercase i). (An uppercase I is used to 
refer to the networks that grew out of the DoD on which the WWW runs, and to refer 
to the Internet.) Internetworking must have the following characteristics:
■It must be scalable in the number of networks and computers attached.
■It must be able to handle the transport of data across vast distances, including 
entire-earth and near-earth space.
■It must be ﬂexible to account for constant technological innovations.
■It must adjust to dynamic conditions on the network.
■It must be cost-effective.
■It must be a system that permits anytime, anywhere data communications to 
anyone.
Figure 7-10 illustrated the connection of one physical network to another through a 
special-purpose computer called a router. This diagram is not unlike the problem that 
led to the beginning of Cisco Systems at Stanford University in 1984 and the invention 
of the router. These networks are described as “directly connected” to the router. The 
router here is useful for handling any “translations” required for the two networks to 
communicate. However, because users seek anytime and anywhere connections to any-
one, this scheme for connecting just two networks quickly becomes inadequate.
Figure 7-11 shows two routers connecting three physical networks. Now the routers 
must make more-complex decisions. Because all users on all networks want to com-
municate with each other, even without being directly connected to one another, the 
router must have some way of dealing with this.
1102.book  Page 384  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Introduction to TCP/IP
385
Figure 7-11 Local and Remote Networks
One way would be for the router to keep a list of all user computers and the paths to 
them. The router would decide whether and where to forward data packets based on 
this table of all users, forwarding based on the destination computer. However, this 
would quickly become problematic as the number of users grows—it is not scalable. 
What if the router could instead keep a list of all networks, leaving the local delivery 
details to the local physical networks? This solution is better and more scalable—for-
warding based on the destination network. In this case, the routers relay messages. In 
principle, if the routers can share some information about which networks they are 
connected to, doing so can scale this idea to many routers.
Figure 7-12 shows the results of this extension, showing the user’s desired view: uni-
versal interconnections, with a minimum of details required by the end users to get 
their packets across the “cloud.” Yet the physical/logical structure to accomplish this 
can be extremely complex. Indeed, the Internet cloud has grown exponentially, with 
devices and protocols constantly being improved to allow more users. The fact that 
the Internet has grown so large, with more than 90,000 core routes and more than 
300,000,000 end users, is testimony to the soundness of the basic Internet architecture.
Thus, two computers, anywhere in the world, following certain hardware, software, 
and protocol speciﬁcations, can communicate reliably (“anyplace/anytime/anyone”). 
Even when they are not directly connected (or even not close to being directly con-
nected), cooperation and procedures for moving data across this network of networks 
have made the Internet possible.

IP Addresses
The network layer is responsible for navigating data through a network. The function 
of the network layer is to ﬁnd the best path through a network. Devices use the net-
work layer addressing scheme to determine the destination of data as it moves through 
the network. This section examines IP addressing and the ﬁve classes of IP addresses, 
along with subnetworks and subnet masks and their roles in IP addressing schemes. 
In addition, this portion of the chapter discusses the differences between public and 
private addresses, IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, and unicast and broadcast messages.
32-Bit Dotted-Decimal IP Address
For any two systems to communicate, they must be able to identify and locate each 
other, as shown in Figure 7-13. Although these addresses are not actual network 
addresses, they represent the concept of address grouping. The A and B identify the 
network, and the number sequence identiﬁes the individual host. The combination of 
letter (network address) and number (host address) creates a unique address for each 
device on the network. In everyday life, names or numbers (such as telephone numbers) 
are often used as unique identiﬁers. Similarly, each computer in a TCP/IP network must 
be given at least one unique identiﬁer, or address. This address allows one computer to 
locate another on a network.

Figure 7-13 Host Addresses
A computer might be connected to more than one network, as shown in Figure 7-14. 
This is an example of a computer that is connected to two different networks. This is 
done by having two network interface cards in the computer. This is called a dual-homed 
device. The important thing to notice here is that the computer’s two interfaces are in 
completely different networks and consequently have different network identiﬁers in 
the addresses. One other important note is that this computer doesn’t pass data through 
it unless it is speciﬁcally conﬁgured to do so; it merely has access to both networks. If 
this is the case, the system must be given more than one address, each address identify-
ing its connection to a different network. Strictly speaking, a device cannot be said to 
have an address, but each of its connection points (or interfaces) to a network has an 
address that allows other computers to locate it on that particular network.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Inside a computer, an IP address is stored as a 32-bit sequence of 1s and 0s, as shown 
in Figure 7-15. To make the IP address easier to use, it is usually written as four decimal 
numbers separated by periods. For instance, an IP address of one computer is 192.168.1.2. 
Another computer might have the address 128.10.2.1. This way of writing the address 
is called dotted-decimal format. In this notation, each IP address is written as four 
parts separated by periods, or dots. Each part of the address is called an octet
because it is made up of 8 binary digits. For example, the IP address 192.168.1.8 is 
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001000 in binary notation. It is plain to see that it 
is easier for humans to understand dotted-decimal notation instead of the binary 1s 
and 0s. This prevents a large number of transposition errors that would result if only 
the binary numbers were used.
Figure 7-15 IP Addressing Format
Using dotted decimal also allows number patterns to be much more quickly understood, 
as shown in Figure 7-15. Both the binary and decimal numbers in the ﬁgure represent 
the same values, but it is much easier to see with the dotted-decimal values. This is one 
of the common problems with working directly with binary numbers. The long strings 
of repeated 1s and 0s make these numbers prone to transposition and omission errors. 
In other words, it is easier to see the relationship between these two numbers:
192.168.1.8
192.168.1.9
than it is to recognize the relationship between their dotted-decimal binary equivalents:
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001000
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001001
Looking at the binaries, it is almost impossible to see that they are consecutive numbers.

Decimal and Binary Conversion
There is usually more than one way to solve a math problem, and decimal-to-binary 
conversion is no exception. This section explores one method, but feel free to use 
another method if it is easier.
To convert a decimal number to binary, the idea is to ﬁrst ﬁnd the biggest power of 2 
that “ﬁts” into the decimal number, as shown in Table 7-1. If this process is designed 
to work with computers, the most logical place to start is with the largest values that 
ﬁt into 1 or 2 bytes.
As mentioned, the most common grouping of bits is 8, which make up one byte. But 
sometimes the largest value that can be held in 1 byte (255) is not large enough for the 
values needed. In this situation you must combine bytes, so instead of having two 8-bit 
numbers you have one 16-bit number, or instead of three 8-bit numbers you have one 
24-bit number. The same rules apply as for 8-bit numbers: You multiply the previous 
position value by 2 to get the present column value. Table 7-1 documents these values 
(starting with a 2-byte/16-bit number), which are very important when you’re learning 
the mechanics of subnetting.
Because working with computers often is referenced by bytes, it is easiest to start with 
byte boundaries and calculate from there, as shown in Table 7-2. To better demonstrate, 
look at the next couple of calculation examples, the ﬁrst being 6,783. Because this 
number is greater than 255, the largest value possible in a single byte, you use 2 bytes. 
Start calculating from 215. The result is that 6,783 equals 00011010 01111111.

The second example is 104. Because this number is less than 255, the conversion can 
be done in 1 byte, as shown in Table 7-3.
So 104 is 01101000.

This method works for any decimal number. Consider the decimal number 1,000,000. 
Because 1,000,000 is greater than the largest value that can be held in 2 bytes (65535), 
you need at least 3 bytes. By multiplying by 2 until you reach 24 bits (3 bytes), you get 
the value 8,388,608, meaning that the largest value that 24 bits can hold is 16,777,215. 
So starting at the 24 bit, follow the process until you get to 0. Continuing with the pro-
cedure, you’ll determine that the decimal number 1,000,000 equals the binary number 
00001111 01000010 01000000.
Binary-to-decimal conversion is just the opposite. Simply place the binary number in 
the table. If there is a 1 in a column position, add that value to the total. Table 7-4 
demonstrates an example of this. It shows converting 00000100 00011101 to decimal, 
resulting in 1053.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
IPv4 Addressing
IP forwards packets from the network on which they originate to the destination network, 
as shown in Figure 7-16. This addressing scheme, therefore, must include an identiﬁer 
for both the source and destination networks. By using the destination network identiﬁer, 
IP can deliver a packet to the destination network. When the packet arrives at a router 
connected to the destination network, IP must then locate the particular computer 
connected to that network. This works in much the same way as the postal system. 
When the mail is routed, it must ﬁrst be delivered to the post ofﬁce at the destination 
city using the zip code, and then that post ofﬁce must locate the ﬁnal destination in 
that city using the street address. This is a two-step process.
Figure 7-16 Communication Path
Accordingly, every IP address has two parts, as shown in Figure 7-17. One part identiﬁes 
the network to which the system is connected, and a second part identiﬁes that particular 
system on the network. This kind of address is called a hierarchical address, because it 
contains different levels, as shown in Figure 7-18. As Figure 7-18 illustrates, each octet 
ranges from 0 to 255. Each octet breaks down into 256 subgroups, and they break down 
into another 256 subgroups with 256 addresses in each. By referring to the group 
address directly above a group in the hierarchy, all the groups that branch from that 
address can be referenced as a single unit. An IP address combines these two identiﬁers 
into one number. This number must be unique, because duplicate addresses are not 
allowed. The ﬁrst part identiﬁes the system’s network address. The second part, the 
host part, tells which particular machine it is on that network.

Figure 7-17 Network and Host Portions of the IP Address

How does a user determine which portion of the address identiﬁes the network and 
which portion identiﬁes the host? The answer begins with the designers of the Internet, 
who thought networks would be built in different sizes, depending on the number of 
computers (hosts) they contained, as shown in Table 7-5.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
The assumption was that there would be a relatively small number of large networks, 
possibly with millions of computers. The designers envisioned a larger number of 
medium-sized networks, with perhaps thousands of computers each. Finally, they 
saw a great number of networks having several hundred or fewer machines. Thus, 
the designers divided the available IP addresses into classes to deﬁne the large (Class A), 
medium (Class B), and small (Class C) networks, as shown in Table 7-6. Knowing the 
class of an IP address is the ﬁrst step in determining which part of the address identiﬁes 
the network and which part identiﬁes the host.
IP Address Classes
To accommodate different-sized networks and to aid in classifying them, IP addresses 
are divided into groupings called classes, as shown in Figure 7-19. This is called classful 
addressing. Each complete 32-bit IP address is broken into a network part and a host 
part. A bit or bit sequence at the start of each address determines the class of the address, 
as shown in Figure 7-20. There are ﬁve IP address classes.

Figure 7-20 Address Class Preﬁxes
Class A Addresses
The Class A address, shown in Figure 7-21, was designed to support extremely large 
networks. A Class A IP address uses only the ﬁrst octet to indicate the network address. 
The remaining three octets enumerate host addresses.
Figure 7-21 Class A Addresses
The ﬁrst bit of a Class A address is always 0. With that ﬁrst bit a 0, the lowest number 
that can be represented is 00000000 (decimal 0), and the highest number that can be 
represented is 01111111 (decimal 127). However, these two numbers, 0 and 127, are 
reserved and cannot be used as a network address. Any address that has a value between 
1 and 126 in the ﬁrst octet is a Class A address.
Class B Addresses
The Class B address, shown in Figure 7-22, was designed to support the needs of 
moderate- to large-sized networks. A Class B IP address uses two of the four octets 
to indicate the network address. The other two octets specify host addresses.

Figure 7-22 Class B Addresses
The ﬁrst 2 bits of the ﬁrst octet of a Class B address are always 10. The remaining 6 bits 
may be populated with either 1s or 0s. Therefore, the lowest number that can be repre-
sented with a Class B address is 10000000 (decimal 128), and the highest number that 
can be represented is 10111111 (decimal 191). Any address that starts with a value in 
the range of 128 to 191 in the ﬁrst octet is a Class B address.
Class C Addresses
The Class C address, shown in Figure 7-23, is the most commonly used of the original 
address classes. This address space was intended to support a lot of small networks.
Figure 7-23 Class C Addresses
A Class C address begins with binary 110. Therefore, the lowest number that can be 
represented is 11000000 (decimal 192), and the highest number that can be represented 
is 11011111 (decimal 223). If an address contains a number in the range of 192 to 223 
in the ﬁrst octet, it is a Class C address.
Class D Addresses
The Class D address, shown in Figure 7-24, was created to enable multicasting in an 
IP address. A multicast address is a unique network address that directs packets that 
have that destination address to predeﬁned groups of IP addresses. Therefore, a single 
station can simultaneously transmit a single stream of data to multiple recipients.

The Class D address space, much like the other address spaces, is mathematically con-
strained. The ﬁrst 4 bits of a Class D address must be 1110. Therefore, the ﬁrst octet 
range for Class D addresses is 11100000 to 11101111, or 224 to 239. An IP address 
that starts with a value in the range of 224 to 239 in the ﬁrst octet is a Class D address.
Class E Addresses
A Class E address, shown in Figure 7-25, has been deﬁned. However, the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) reserves these addresses for its own research. Therefore, 
no Class E addresses have been released for use in the Internet. The ﬁrst 4 bits of a 
Class E address are always set to 1. Therefore, the ﬁrst octet range for Class E addresses 
is 11110000 to 11111111, or 240 to 255.

Table 7-7 shows the IP address range of the ﬁrst octet (in decimal and binary) for each 
IP address class.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Reserved IP Addresses
Certain addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices on a network. These 
reserved host addresses include the following:
■Network addresses are used to identify the network itself (see Figure 7-26). The 
upper box represents the 198.150.11.0 network. Data that is sent to any host 
on that network (198.150.11.1 to 198.150.11.254) is seen outside the LAN as 
198.159.11.0. The only time the host numbers matter is when the data is on the 
LAN. The LAN in the lower box is treated the same as the upper LAN, except 
that its network number is 198.150.12.0.
■The broadcast address is used to broadcast packets to all the devices on a net-
work (see Figure 7-27). The upper box represents the 198.150.11.255 broadcast 
address. Data that is sent to the broadcast address is read by any host on that 
network (198.150.11.1 to 198.150.11.254). The LAN in the lower box is treated 
the same as the upper LAN, except that its broadcast address is 198.150.12.255.
Figure 7-26 Network Address
An IP address that has binary 0s in all host bit positions is reserved for the network
address, as shown in Figure 7-28. This Class B address has all its host bits set to 0. That 
is why it is identiﬁed as the network address. Therefore, as a Class A network example, 
113.0.0.0 is the IP address of the network containing the host 113.1.2.3. A router uses 
the network IP address when it forwards data on the Internet. As a Class B network 
example, the IP address 176.10.0.0 is a network address, as shown in Figure 7-28.

Figure 7-27 Broadcast Address
Figure 7-28 Network Address
In a Class B network address, the ﬁrst two octets, written as dotted-decimal numbers, 
are assigned by default. The last two octets contain 0s because those 16 bits are for 
host numbers and identify devices that are attached to the network. This is called a 
unicast address (uni means one). A unicast address points to just one host on the net-
work. The IP address in the example (176.10.0.0) is reserved for the network address 
and is never used as an address for any device that is attached to it. An example of 
an IP address for a device on the 176.10.0.0 network is 176.10.16.1. In this example, 
176.10 is the network address portion, and 16.1 is the host address portion.
To send data to all the devices on a network, a broadcast address is needed. A broadcast 
occurs when a source sends data to all devices on a network, as shown in Figure 7-29. 
This Class B address is the broadcast address for this network. When packets are received 
with this destination address, the data is processed by every computer. To ensure that

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
all the other devices on the network process the broadcast, the sender must use a desti-
nation IP address that they can recognize and process. Broadcast IP addresses end with 
binary 1s in the entire host part of the address (the Host ﬁeld).
Figure 7-29 Broadcast Address
For the network 176.10.0.0, where the last 16 bits make up the Host ﬁeld (or the host 
part of the address), the broadcast that is sent to all devices on that network includes a 
destination address of 176.10.255.255 (because 255 is the decimal value of an octet 
containing 11111111).
Public and Private Addresses
Internet stability depends directly on the uniqueness of publicly used network addresses. 
As shown in Figure 7-30, there is an issue with the networking addressing scheme. Both 
networks have a network address of 198.150.11.0. When data transmissions reach the 
router, which network would it forward to? A scheme such as this one would greatly 
increase the amount of network trafﬁc and would defeat a router’s basic function. 
Therefore, some mechanism was needed to ensure that addresses were, in fact, unique. 
This responsibility originally rested with the InterNIC (Internet Network Information 
Center). This organization is now defunct and has been succeeded by the Internet 
Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). IANA carefully manages the remaining supply 
of IP addresses to ensure that duplication of publicly used addresses does not occur. 
Such duplication would cause instability in the Internet and compromise its capability 
to deliver datagrams to networks using the duplicated addresses.

IP Addresses
401
Figure 7-30 Required Unique Addresses
Public IP addresses are unique. No two machines that connect to a public network can 
have the same IP address, because public IP addresses are global and standardized. All 
machines connected to the Internet agree to adhere to the system. Public IP addresses 
must be obtained from an Internet service provider (ISP) or a registry at some expense.
With the rapid growth of the Internet, public IP addresses were beginning to run out, so 
new addressing schemes such as classless interdomain routing (CIDR) and IPv6 were 
developed to help solve the problem. CIDR and IPv6 are discussed later.
Another solution that was developed is the use of private IP addresses, as shown in 
Table 7-8. As stated previously, Internet hosts require a globally unique IP address. 
However, private networks that are not connected to the Internet can use any valid 
address, as long as it is unique within the private network. Many private networks 
exist alongside public networks. Grabbing “just any address” is strongly discouraged 
because that network might eventually be connected to the Internet.
RFC 1918 sets aside three blocks of IP addresses (a single Class A address, a range of 
Class B addresses, and a range of Class C addresses) for private, internal use. Addresses 
in this range are not routed on the Internet backbone; Internet routers immediately 
discard private addresses.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
If you are addressing a nonpublic intranet, a test lab, or a home network, these private 
addresses can be used instead of globally unique addresses. Private IP addresses can be 
intermixed with public IP addresses, as shown in Figure 7-31, to conserve the number 
of addresses used for internal connections.
Figure 7-31 Using Private IP Addresses Within the WAN
Connecting a network to the Internet using private addresses requires translating the 
private addresses to public addresses. This translation process is called Network Address 
Translation (NAT). A router usually is the device that performs NAT.
Introduction to Subnetting
Another way to conserve IP addresses, like CIDR, IPv6, and private addresses, is the 
use of subnetting. This method of dividing full network address classes into smaller 
pieces has helped prevent complete IP address exhaustion. Figure 7-32 shows a Class B 
network (131.108.0.0) divided into three subnetworks. It is impossible to cover TCP/IP 
without mentioning subnetting. As a system administrator, you must understand sub-
netting as a means of dividing and identifying separate networks throughout the LAN. 
It is not always necessary to subnet a small network, but for large or extremely large 
networks, subnetting is required. Simply stated, subnetting a network means using the 
subnet mask to divide the network and break a large network into smaller, more efﬁ-
cient, more manageable segments, or subnets, as shown in Figure 7-33. This is like the

American telephone system, which breaks the system into area codes, and then exchange 
codes, and ﬁnally local numbers. These elements of the phone system are comparable 
to network numbers, subnets, and individual host addresses, respectively, in an IP 
internetwork.
Figure 7-32 Addressing with Subnets
Figure 7-33 Subnet Addresses
The system administrator must resolve these issues when adding and expanding the 
network. It is important to know how many subnet/networks are needed and how 
many hosts are allowed to be on each network. With subnetting, the network is not 
limited to the standard Class A, B, or C network masks and there is more ﬂexibility in 
the network design.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Subnet addresses include the Class A, Class B, or Class C network portion, plus a Subnet 
ﬁeld and a Host ﬁeld. These ﬁelds are created from the original host portion for the 
entire network. The ability to decide how to divide the original host portion into the new 
Subnet and Host ﬁelds provides addressing ﬂexibility for the network administrator.
To create a subnet address, a network administrator borrows bits from the Host ﬁeld 
and designates them as the Subnet ﬁeld, as shown in Table 7-9. The minimum number 
of bits that can be borrowed is 2. If you were to borrow only 1 bit, to create a subnet, 
you would have only a network number (the .0 network) and a broadcast number (the 
.255 network). The maximum number of bits that can be borrowed can be any number 
that leaves at least 2 bits for the host number. In Table 7-9’s example of a Class C IP 
address, bits from the Host ﬁeld have been borrowed for the Subnet ﬁeld.
IPv4 Versus IPv6
When TCP/IPa was adopted in the 1980s, it relied on a two-level addressing scheme, 
which at the time offered adequate scalability. Unfortunately, the architects of TCP/IP 
could not have predicted that their protocol would eventually sustain a global network 
of information, commerce, and entertainment. More than 20 years ago, IPv4 offered 
an addressing strategy that, although scalable for a time, resulted in an inefﬁcient allo-
cation of addresses.

IP Addresses
405
Class A and B addresses make up 75 percent of the IPv4 address space, as shown in 
Figure 7-34, but a relative handful of organizations (fewer than 17,000) can be assigned 
a Class A or B network number. Class C network addresses are far more numerous than 
Class A and Class B addresses, but they account for only 12.5 percent of the possible 
4 billion IP addresses.
Figure 7-34 IPv4 Address Allocation
Unfortunately, Class C addresses are limited to 254 hosts, not meeting the needs of 
larger organizations that cannot acquire a Class A or B address. Even if there were 
more Class A, B, and C addresses, too many network addresses would cause Internet 
routers to grind to a halt under the weight of the enormous routing tables required to 
store the routes to reach the networks.
As early as 1992, the IETF identiﬁed two speciﬁc concerns:
■Exhaustion of the remaining, unassigned IPv4 network addresses—At the time, 
the Class B space was on the verge of depletion.
■The rapid and substantial increase in the size of Internet routing tables because 
of the Internet’s growth—As more Class C networks came online, the resulting 
ﬂood of new network information threatened the capability of Internet routers to 
cope effectively.
Over the past two decades, numerous extensions to IPv4 have been developed that are 
speciﬁcally designed to improve the efﬁciency with which the 32-bit address space can 
be used. Two of the more important are subnet masks and CIDR.
Meanwhile, an even more extensible and scalable version of IP, IPv6, has been deﬁned 
and developed. IPv6 uses 128 bits rather than the 32 bits currently used in IPv4, as

shown in Figure 7-35. IPv6 uses hexadecimal numbers to represent the 128 bits. It pro-
vides 16 billion IP addresses (3.4 × 1038 addresses). This version of IP should provide 
sufﬁcient addresses for future communication needs.
Figure 7-35 IPv4 and IPv6
The IPv6 shorthand representation of the 128 bits uses eight 16-bit numbers, shown as 
four hexadecimal digits, as shown in Figure 7-36. The groups of four hex digits are 
separated by colons. If there are leading 0s in the hex digits, they may be omitted.
Figure 7-36 IPv4 and IPv6
After years of planning and development, IPv6 is slowly being implemented in select 
networks. Eventually, IPv6 might replace IPv4 as the dominant Internet protocol.

IP Address Assignment, Acquisition, and Hierarchy
407
IP Address Assignment, Acquisition, and Hierarchy
This section discusses how network devices obtain IP addresses. For a network to keep 
functioning, the IP addresses must be assigned according to a speciﬁc hierarchy. How 
and why this is done are discussed in the following section. IP addresses can be assigned 
either statically or dynamically. Both methods are covered here.
Obtaining an Internet Address
For a host on a network to function on the Internet, it needs to obtain a globally unique 
address. A host’s physical or MAC address is only locally signiﬁcant. Being locally sig-
niﬁcant means that the address can only identify the host in its own LAN. It has no 
meaning to any device that is not in that LAN.
IP is the most widely used global addressing scheme. It is a hierarchical addressing 
scheme that allows individual addresses to be associated and treated as groups, as 
shown in Figure 7-37. These groups of addresses allow efﬁcient transfer of data across 
the Internet.
Figure 7-37 Internet Address Hierarchy
There are essentially two methods for assigning IP addresses—static addressing and
dynamic addressing. The next few sections cover static and dynamic addressing. Regard-
less of which addressing scheme is chosen, no two interfaces can have the same IP 
address. This would cause a conﬂict that might cause both the hosts involved not to 
operate properly.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Static Assignment of an IP Address
When IP addresses are assigned statically, each device must be conﬁgured with an IP 
address. Each operating system has its own way of conﬁguring TCP/IP. This method 
requires records of the address assignments to be kept, because problems can occur 
in a network if duplicate IP addresses are used. Some operating systems, such as Win-
dows 95 and Windows NT, send an ARP request to check for a duplicate IP address 
when they attempt to initialize TCP/IP. If a duplicate is discovered, the operating system 
does not initialize TCP/IP and generates an error message. Not all operating systems 
identify duplicate IP addresses. This again emphasizes the need for good record-keeping.
The main reason that a device would be assigned a static IP address is if the device needs 
to be referenced by other devices. A good example is a web server. If a web server got a 
new IP address each time it started up, it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd the web server. As 
an example of this address changing, if a city were to constantly change street names 
and building addresses, maps would no longer help you locate a particular building. If 
an address changes, it is no longer easy to return to the location. If a building is difﬁ-
cult to get to, people will stop trying to locate it.
Certain types of devices need to maintain a static IP address. Web servers, network 
printers, application servers, and routers are good examples of devices that require 
permanent IP addresses.
Address Resolution Protocol
For devices to communicate, the sending device needs the destination device’s IP address 
and MAC address. When a device tries to communicate with a device whose IP addresses it 
knows, it must determine the MAC addresses. The TCP/IP suite has a protocol called 
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) that can automatically obtain the MAC address. 
ARP lets a computer ﬁnd the MAC address of the computer that is associated with an 
IP address, as shown in Figure 7-38.
Some devices keep ARP tables, which contain the MAC addresses and IP addresses 
of other devices that are connected to the same LAN. ARP tables map IP addresses to 
the corresponding MAC addresses. ARP tables are sections of RAM memory that are 
maintained automatically on each device, as shown in Tables 7-10 and 7-11. It is rare 
that you must manually make an ARP table entry. Each computer on a network main-
tains its own ARP table.

Whenever a network device wants to send data across a network, it uses information

Figure 7-39 ARP Tables
ARP Operation Within a Subnet
If a host wants to send data to another host, it must know the destination IP and MAC 
addresses. If it cannot locate a MAC address for the destination IP address in its ARP 
table, the host initiates a process called an ARP request, as shown in Figure 7-39.
An ARP request lets a host discover the destination MAC address. A host builds an 
ARP request packet and sends it to all devices on the network. This ARP request 
packet is divided into two parts:
■The frame header
■The ARP message
To ensure that all devices see the ARP request, the source uses a broadcast MAC address. 
The broadcast address in a MAC addressing scheme has all places set to hexadecimal F. 
Thus, a MAC broadcast address has the form FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF. Because ARP request 
packets travel in a broadcast mode, all devices on the local network receive the packets 
and pass them up to the network layer for further examination. If a device’s IP address 
matches the destination IP address in the ARP request, that device responds by sending 
the source its MAC address. This is called the ARP reply.
When the originating device receives the ARP reply, it extracts the MAC address from 
the sender hardware address ﬁeld and updates its ARP table. The originating device can

then properly address its data with both a destination MAC address and a destination 
IP address. It uses this new information to perform Layer 2 and Layer 3 encapsulations 
of the data before it sends them out over the network. When the data arrives at the 
destination, the data link layer makes a match, strips the MAC header, and transfers 
the data up to the network layer. The network layer examines the data and ﬁnds that 
its IP address matches the destination IP address carried in the IP header. The network 
layer strips the IP header and transfers the encapsulated data to the next-highest layer 
in the OSI model, the transport layer (Layer 4). This process is repeated until the rest 
of the packet’s partially de-encapsulated data reaches the application, where the user 
data can be read.
Default Gateway
A default gateway is the IP address of the interface on the router that connects to the 
network segment on which the source host is located. The default gateway’s IP address 
must be in the same network segment as the source host, as shown in Figure 7-40.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
RARP IP Address Assignment
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) binds MAC addresses to IP addresses. 
This binding allows some network devices to encapsulate data before sending it out on 
the network. A network device or workstation might know its MAC address but not 
its IP address. Devices using RARP require that a RARP server be present on the net-
work to answer RARP requests, as shown in Figure 7-41.
Figure 7-41 RARP IP Address Assignment
Consider an example in which a source device wants to send data to another device. 
The source knows the destination’s MAC address but is unable to locate its IP address 
in the ARP table. For the destination device to retrieve the data, pass it to higher layers 
of the OSI model, and respond to the originating device, the source must include both 
its MAC address and IP address. Therefore, the source initiates a process called a RARP 
request, which helps it detect its own IP address. The device builds a RARP request 
packet, as shown in Figure 7-42, and sends it out on the network. To ensure that all devices 
see the RARP request on the network, the device uses a broadcast MAC address.

RARP Header Structure

414
Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
RARP uses the same packet format as ARP. But in a RARP request, the MAC headers 
and operation code are different from an ARP request. The RARP packet format con-
tains places for MAC addresses of both destination and source. The source IP address 
ﬁeld is empty. The broadcast goes to all devices on the network; therefore, the destina-
tion MAC address is set to all binary 1s. Workstations running RARP have codes in 
ROM that direct them to start the RARP process. Figure 7-43 shows the RARP process.
Figure 7-43 RARP Process
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) IP Address Assignment
Like RARP, BOOTP operates in a client/server environment and requires only a single 
packet exchange to obtain IP information. However, unlike RARP, which sends back 
only a four-octet IP address, BOOTP packets can include the IP address as well as the 
address of a router (default gateway), the address of a server, and vendor-speciﬁc infor-
mation, as shown in Figure 7-44.
One of the problems with BOOTP is that it was not designed to provide dynamic 
address assignment. With BOOTP, a network administrator creates a conﬁguration ﬁle 
that speciﬁes the parameters for each device. The administrator must add hosts and 
maintain the BOOTP database. Also, even though the addresses are dynamically 
assigned, there is still a one-to-one relationship between the number of IP addresses 
and the number of hosts. This means that for every host on the network, there must be 
a BOOTP proﬁle with an IP address assignment. No two proﬁles can have the same IP 
address, because those proﬁles might be used at the same time, and that would mean 
that two hosts have the same IP address.

IP Address Assignment, Acquisition, and Hierarchy
415
Figure 7-44 BOOTP Message Structure
A device uses BOOTP when it starts up to obtain an IP address. BOOTP uses UDP 
to carry messages; the UDP message is encapsulated in an IP packet. A computer 
uses BOOTP to send a broadcast IP packet (using a destination IP address of all 1s—
255.255.255.255—in dotted-decimal notation). A BOOTP server receives the broad-
cast and then sends back a broadcast. The client receives a frame and checks the MAC 
address. If it ﬁnds its own MAC address in the destination address ﬁeld and a broad-
cast in the IP destination ﬁeld, it takes and stores the IP address and other information 
supplied in the BOOTP reply message.
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) IP Address 
Assignment
Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) is the successor to BOOTP. Unlike 
BOOTP, DHCP allows a host to obtain an IP address dynamically without the net-
work administrator’s having to set up an individual proﬁle for that machine. All that is 
required for using DHCP is a deﬁned range of IP addresses on a DHCP server. As hosts 
come online, they contact the DHCP server and request an address. The DHCP server 
chooses an address and leases it to that host. With DHCP, the entire computer’s TCP/IP 
conﬁguration can be obtained in one message. This includes all the data supplied by 
the BOOTP message, plus a leased IP address and subnet mask.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
The major advance that DHCP makes over BOOTP is that it allows users to be mobile. 
This allows them to freely change network connections from location to location. There 
is no longer a requirement for a ﬁxed proﬁle for every device attached to the network 
as there is with the BOOTP system. The key to this DHCP advancement is its capabil-
ity to lease an IP address to a device and then reclaim that IP address for another user 
after the ﬁrst user releases it. This means that there is now a one-to-many ratio of IP 
addresses and that an address is available to anyone who connects to the network.
DHCP uses the same message format as BOOTP, as shown in Figure 7-45, with the 
following exceptions. The unused ﬁeld in the BOOTP format now represents a Flags 
ﬁeld. The most-signiﬁcant bit is the only ﬂag deﬁned currently. It represents a broad-
cast message. DHCP and BOOTP also deﬁne the vendor-speciﬁc area, as follows:
■1-byte Option ﬁeld
■1-byte Length ﬁeld
■Variable-length (speciﬁed by the Length ﬁeld) Option Data ﬁeld
Figure 7-45 DHCP Message Structure
For DHCP message types, the values for the ﬁelds are as follows:
■53 for the Option ﬁeld, indicating a DHCP message
■1 for the Length ﬁeld, indicating that the Data ﬁeld is 1 byte long

When a DHCP client boots, it enters an initialize state. It sends DHCPDISCOVER 
broadcast messages, which are UDP packets with the port number set to the BOOTP 
port. After sending the DHCPDISCOVER packets, the client moves into the select state 
and collects DHCPOFFER responses from DHCP servers. The client then selects the 
ﬁrst response it receives and negotiates the lease time (how long it can keep the address 
without renewing it) with the DHCP server by sending a DHCPREQUEST packet. Next, 
the DHCP server acknowledges a client request with a DHCPACK packet. The client 
can now enter the bound state and begin using the address. Figure 7-46 summarizes 
the DHCP state.
Figure 7-46 DHCP Startup States
Problems in Address Resolution
One of the major problems in networking is how to communicate with other network 
devices. In TCP/IP communications, a datagram on a LAN must contain both a desti-
nation MAC address and a destination IP address. In Figure 7-47, computer 176.10.16.1 
wants to send data to 176.10.16.4. It has its IP address, but data transmission requires 
both the IP and MAC address of 176.10.16.4. How does it get that MAC address to 
perform the data transmission?

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Figure 7-47 Address Resolution Issues
These addresses must be correct and match the destination host’s MAC and IP addresses, 
or the destination host discards them. So on LANs there must be a way to automati-
cally resolve (or translate) IP addresses to MAC addresses. Doing the resolution manu-
ally would be much too rigid and time-consuming for the user. This solution covers 
only LAN issues; a different set of issues are raised when data is sent outside the LAN.
There are two parts to the problem in communicating with devices that are not on the 
same physical network segment:
■Obtaining the MAC address of the intermediate devices
■Transferring the data packets from one network segment to another to get to the 
destination host
Figure 7-48 illustrates this problem with an example. Computer 192.168.10.34 needs 
to communicate with computer 192.168.1.1. How does it get the MAC address for 
192.168.1.1, and would it do any good if it could get the MAC address? Remember 
that MAC addresses are useful only in LANs. They won’t be any help outside the 
192.168.10.0 network. So you need the router’s MAC address to get the data out of 
the LAN and on to the WAN system.

Summary
419
Routers running proxy ARP capture ARP packets. They respond with their MAC 
addresses for those requests in which the IP address is not in the range of addresses of 
the local subnet. For example, in Figure 7-49, if Machine A sends an ARP requests to 
Machine F, the router processes the request and replies to A with its own MAC address 
to be mapped to the IP address of Machine F. In the previous description of how data 
is sent to a host on a different subnet, the default gateway is conﬁgured. If the source 
host does not have a default gateway conﬁgured, it sends an ARP request. All hosts on 
the segment, including the router, receive the ARP request. The router compares the IP 
destination address with the IP subnet address to determine whether the destination 
IP address is on the same subnet as the source host. If the subnet address is the same, 
the router discards the packet. The packet is discarded because the destination IP address 
is on the same segment as the source’s IP address. This means that the destination 
device on the segment should respond to the ARP request. The exception to this is that 
the destination IP address is not currently assigned, which generates an error response 
on the source host.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■To provide extra ﬂexibility for the network administrator, networks—particularly 
large ones—are often divided into smaller networks called subnetworks or sub-
nets. Subnetting allows a network administrator to get around IPv4’s limitations 
by dividing a single network address into many subnets visible only within that 
single network.
■The function of a subnet mask is to tell devices which part of an address is the 
network number, including the subnet, and which part is the host.
■Internetworking functions of the network layer include network addressing and 
best-path selection for data trafﬁc.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
■How to explain IP addressing, IP address classes, reserved IP address space, 
private IP address space, and IP subnetting
■How to explain the evolution of IP addressing, including the need for an increase 
in the size of the IP address space
■A computer needs an IP address (hierarchical address) to communicate on the 
Internet.
■There are two ways to conﬁgure IP addresses: statically and dynamically.
■There are multiple ways to assign an IP address dynamically.
■When a device does not know its own IP address, it uses RARP, BOOTP, or DHCP.
■When the device that originated a RARP request receives a RARP reply, it copies 
its IP address into its memory cache, where it resides for as long as the session lasts.
■BOOTP supplies more information to a client than just an IP address.
■DHCP allows computers to be mobile, connecting to many different networks 
as needed.

Key Terms
421
Key Terms
application layer
Handles high-level protocols and issues of representation, encoding, 
and dialog control. The TCP/IP protocol suite combines all application-related issues 
into one layer and ensures that this data is properly packaged for the next layer.
broadcast address
Used to broadcast packets to all the devices on a network.
Class A address
Designed to support extremely large networks. A Class A IP address 
uses only the ﬁrst octet to indicate the network address. The remaining three octets 
enumerate host addresses.
Class B address
Designed to support the needs of moderate- to large-sized networks. 
A Class B IP address uses two of the four octets to indicate the network address. The 
other two octets specify host addresses.
Class C address
The most commonly used of the original address classes. This address 
space was intended to support a lot of small networks.
Class D address
Created to enable multicasting in an IP address.
Class E address
The IETF reserves these addresses for its own research. Therefore, 
no Class E addresses have been released for use in the Internet.
dotted-decimal format
In this notation, each IP address is written as four parts 
separated by periods, or dots.
IP address class
A 32-bit IP address is broken into a network part and a host part. 
A bit or bit sequence at the start of each address determines the address’s class.
IP Version 6 (IPv6)
The replacement for the current version of IP (Version 4). IPv6 
includes support for ﬂow ID in the packet header, which can be used to identify ﬂows. 
Formerly called IPng (IP next generation).
multicast address
A unique network address that directs packets that have that 
destination address to predeﬁned groups of IP addresses.
network access layer
The layer that is concerned with all the issues that an IP packet 
requires to make a physical link to the network medium.
subnetting
The method of dividing full network address classes into smaller pieces. 
This has prevented complete IP address exhaustion.

Chapter 7: TCP/IP Protocol Suite and IP Addressing
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
The common name for the 
suite of protocols developed by the U.S. DoD in the 1970s to support the construction of 
worldwide internetworks. TCP and IP are the two best-known protocols in the suite.
transport layer
Provides transport services from the source host to the destination 
host. It constitutes a logical connection between the network’s endpoints: the sending 
host and the receiving host.

Chapter 8
Routing Fundamentals and 
Subnets
This chapter covers topics related to the Internet Protocol (IP). IP is the fundamental pro-
tocol used in the Internet. Topics discussed include how IP is delivered, how the header is 
modiﬁed at Layer 3 devices, and the actual layout of the IP packet. This chapter also covers 
the relationship between connectionless and connection-oriented networking services. You 
will learn the difference between routing and routed protocols and how routers track dis-
tance between locations. This chapter introduces the distance-vector, link-state, and hybrid 
routing approaches and how each resolves common routing problems.
Be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and PhotoZooms, 
which you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
A protocol is a standards-based set of rules that determines how computers communicate 
with each other across networks. A protocol also serves as the common denominator or 
medium by which different applications, hosts, or systems communicate. When computers 
communicate with one another, they exchange data messages. To accept and act on these 
messages, computers must have deﬁnitions of how a message is deﬁned and what it means. 
Examples of messages include establishing a connection to a remote machine, sending or 
receiving e-mail, and transferring ﬁles and data.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
A protocol describes
■The format that a message must take
■The way in which computers must exchange a message within the context of a 
particular activity, such as sending messages across networks
Because of the similarity of a routed/routable protocol versus a routing protocol, 
confusion over these terms often exists. The following provides some clariﬁcation:
■Routed protocol—Any network protocol that provides enough information in 
its network layer address to allow a packet to be forwarded from one host to 
another host based on the addressing scheme. Routed protocols deﬁne the ﬁeld 
formats within a packet. Packets are generally conveyed from end system to end 
system. A routed protocol uses the routing table to forward packets. Examples of 
routed or routable protocols are shown in the routing table in Figure 8-1. They 
include the following:
— Internet Protocol (IP)
— Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX)
— AppleTalk

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
429
■Routing protocol—Supports a routed protocol by providing mechanisms for shar-
ing routing information. Routing protocol messages move between the routers. A 
routing protocol allows the routers to communicate with other routers to update 
and maintain tables. Here are some TCP/IP examples of routing protocols:
— Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
— Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
— Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
— Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
For a protocol to be routable, it must provide the capability to assign a network number, 
as well as a host number, to each individual device. Some protocols, such as Internet-
work Packet Exchange (IPX), only require that an administrator assign a network 
number, because they use a host’s Media Access Control (MAC) address for the physical 
number. Other protocols, such as IP, require that a complete address be provided, as 
well as a network mask.
Both the IP address and network mask are required to have a routed network. A net-
work mask separates the network and host portions of a 32-bit IP address. IPX uses 
the MAC address concatenated with an administrator-assigned network address to 
create the complete address and does not use a network mask. With IP addresses, the 
network address is obtained by comparing the address with the network mask.
A network mask allows groups of sequential IP addresses to be treated as a single unit. 
If this grouping were not allowed, each host would have to be mapped individually 
for routing. That would not be possible with the millions of hosts on the Internet. As 
shown in Figure 8-2, all 254 addresses in the sequence of 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.254 
can be represented by the network address 192.168.10.0. This allows data to be sent 
to any one of these hosts just by locating the network address. This means that routing 
tables need to contain only one entry of 192.168.10.0 instead of all 254 individual 
entries. This is according to the Internet Software Consortium (www.isc.org). For 
routing to function, this process of grouping must be used.
The following sections describe the router’s use and operations in performing the key 
internetworking function of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model’s 
network layer, Layer 3. In addition, you’ll learn about the difference between routing 
and routed protocols and how routers track distance between locations. Finally, you’ll 
learn more about distance-vector, link-state, and hybrid routing approaches and how 
each resolves common routing problems.

Routing Overview
Routing is an OSI Layer 3 function. It functions as a hierarchical organizational scheme 
that allows individual addresses to be grouped and treated as a single unit until the 
individual address is needed for ﬁnal delivery of the data. Routing is the process of 
ﬁnding the most efﬁcient path from one device to another, as shown in Figure 8-3. The 
main device that performs this process is the router.

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
431
A router has two key functions:
■To maintain routing tables and make sure other routers know of changes in 
the network topology. This function is performed using a routing protocol to 
communicate network information to other routers.
■When packets arrive at an interface, the router must use the routing table to 
determine where to send the packets. It switches them to the appropriate inter-
face, adds the necessary framing for the interface, and then transmits the frame.
A router is a network layer device that uses one or more routing metrics to determine 
the optimal path along which network trafﬁc should be forwarded. The routing metric 
is a value used to determine the route’s desirability. Routing protocols use various 
combinations of criteria for determining the routing metric, as shown in Figure 8-4.
Figure 8-4 Routing Protocol Metrics
The metrics of hop count, bandwidth, delay, reliability, load, and cost are calculated 
in various combinations to determine the best path through an internetwork. Routers 
interconnect network segments or entire networks. They pass data frames between 
networks based on Layer 3 information. Routers make logical decisions regarding 
the best path for the delivery of data on an internetwork and then direct packets to 
the appropriate output port to be encapsulated for transmission. The encapsulation/
de-encapsulation process occurs each time a packet passes through a router and data is 
sent from one device to another, as shown in Figure 8-5. Encapsulation breaks the data 
stream into segments, adds the appropriate headers and trailers, and transmits the data. The 
de-encapsulation process is the opposite, removing the headers and trailers and then 
recombining the data into a seamless stream. Routers take frames from LAN devices 
(for example, workstations) and, based on Layer 3 information, forward them through 
the network.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Figure 8-5 Data Encapsulation
This chapter and the rest of the book focus on the most commonly used routable (or 
routed) protocol—IP. Even though the focus is on IP, it is important to know that there 
are other routable protocols, such as IPX/SPX and AppleTalk.
Protocols such as IP, IPX/SPX, and AppleTalk provide Layer 3 support and therefore 
are routable. Protocols that do not support Layer 3 are called nonroutable protocols. 
The most common of these is NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI)—a small, 
fast, efﬁcient protocol that is limited to running on one segment.
Routing Versus Switching
Routing is often contrasted with Layer 2 switching, which might seem to perform the 
same function to the casual observer. The primary difference between the two is that 
switching occurs at Layer 2 (the data link layer) of the OSI model, and routing occurs 
at Layer 3. This distinction means that routing and switching use different information 
in the process of moving data from source to destination.
The relationship between switching and routing parallels that of local and long distance 
telephone calls. When a telephone call is made to another local number (a number 
with the same area code), a local switch handles the call. However, the local switch 
cannot keep track of all the telephone numbers in the world—only its own local num-
bers. When the switch receives a request for a call outside its area, it switches the call 
to a higher-level switch that recognizes area codes. The higher-level switch switches the 
call so that it eventually gets to the local switch for the area code dialed.

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
433
The router performs a function similar to that of the higher-level switch in the telephone 
network, as shown in Figure 8-6. Layer 2 switching takes place within the LAN, also 
called a broadcast domain. Layer 3 routing moves trafﬁc between broadcast domains. 
This requires the hierarchical addressing scheme that a Layer 3 addressing scheme like 
IP provides. The Layer 2 switch cannot recognize the Layer 3 IP address—only local 
MAC addresses. When a host has data for a nonlocal IP address, it sends the frame to 
its default gateway, the router, by using the router’s MAC address.
Figure 8-6 Layer 2 Switching and Layer 3 Routing
A Layer 2 switch interconnects segments belonging to the same logical network or 
subnetwork. If Host X needs to send a frame to another host on a different network 
or subnetwork, Host X sends the frame to the router that is also connected to the 
switch. Host X knows the router IP address because the Host IP conﬁguration includes 
the IP address of the default gateway, but it does not know its MAC address. Host X 
learns the router’s MAC address by using an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request, 
which translates IP addresses to MAC addresses. The switch forwards the frame to the 
router based on the router’s destination MAC address. The router examines the packet’s 
Layer 3 destination address to make the forwarding decision. The default gateway is 
the router that is on the same network or subnetwork as Host X.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Much like the way a Layer 2 switch keeps a table of known MAC addresses, the router 
keeps a table of IP network addresses called a routing table, as shown in Figure 8-7. 
Each computer and router Ethernet interface maintains an ARP table for Layer 2 com-
munication. The ARP table is effective only for the broadcast domain that it is connected 
to. The router also maintains a routing table that allows it to route data outside the 
broadcast domains. Each ARP table contains the IP-MAC address pair. (The MAC 
address in Figure 8-7 is represented by the acronym MAC because the actual addresses 
are too long to ﬁt in the ﬁgure.) The routing tables show how the route was learned—
in this case, directly connected (C) and RIP (R)—the network IP address for reachable 
networks, the hop count to get those networks, and the interface the data must be sent 
out to get to the destination network. The difference between these two types of addresses 
is that the MAC address is not organized in any particular way. This is OK, though, 
because any individual network segment does not have a large number of hosts, so it is 
manageable. If the IP network addresses were treated the same way, the Internet simply 
would not work. There would be no way to organize all the addresses and the directions 
on how to get to them (hierarchically or otherwise). Organizing IP addresses hierarchi-
cally lets you group addresses to be treated as a single unit until you need to locate 
an individual host. A way to understand this is to think of a library that contains only 
millions of individual pages in a large pile. This material is useless, because it is impossible 
to locate an individual document. If the pages were organized into books, and each 
page were individually identiﬁed, and if the books were listed in an index, it would be 
much easier to ﬁnd and use the data.

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
435
Another difference between switched and routed networks is that Layer 2 switched 
networks do not block Layer 3 broadcasts. As a result, they can be swamped by 
broadcast storms. Routers normally block broadcasts so that a broadcast storm affects 
only the broadcast domain it originated on. Routers also provide higher security and 
bandwidth control than Layer 2 switches because they block broadcasts.
Table 8-1 compares routers and switches.
Routed Versus Routing
There are two categories of protocols at the network layer—routed and routing (see 
Figure 8-8). Routed protocols transport data across a network, and routing protocols 
allow routers to properly direct the data from one location to another.
Protocols that transfer data from one host to another across a router are routed or 
routable protocols.
A routed protocol operates as shown in Figure 8-9:
■It includes any network protocol suite that provides enough information in its 
network layer address to allow a router to forward it to the next device and 
ultimately to its destination.
■It deﬁnes the format and use of the ﬁelds within a packet. Packets generally are 
conveyed from end system to end system.
IP and IPX are examples of routed protocols. Other examples include DECnet, Apple-
Talk, Banyan VINES, and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).
Routers use routing protocols to exchange routing tables and share routing information. 
In other words, routing protocols let routers route routed protocols after a path has 
been determined.

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
437
A routing protocol operates as shown in Figure 8-10:
■It provides processes for sharing routing information.
■It allows routers to communicate with other routers to update and maintain 
the routing tables.
Examples of routing protocols that support IP routed protocols include RIP, IGRP, 
OSPF, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and EIGRP.
Figure 8-10 Routing Protocol
Path Determination
Path determination occurs at Layer 3 (the network layer). It lets a router evaluate the 
available paths to a destination and establish the preferred handling of a packet. Routing 
services use network topology information when evaluating network paths, as shown 
in Figure 8-11. Path determination is the process that a router uses to choose the next 
hop in a path toward a packet’s ultimate destination. This process is also called routing
the packet.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Path determination for a packet can be compared to a person driving a car from one 
side of a city to another. The driver has a map that shows the streets to take to get to 
the destination. The drive from one intersection to another is a hop. Similarly, a router 
uses a map that shows the available paths to a destination. Routers can also make their 
decisions based on the trafﬁc density and the link’s speed (bandwidth), just as a driver 
might choose a faster path (a highway) or use less-crowded back streets. In this section, 
you’ll see how a router determines the best path for packets traveling from one net-
work to another.
Network Layer Addressing
A network address helps the router identify a path within the network cloud and also 
provides hierarchical or subnet information. The router uses the network address to 
identify the destination network of a packet within an internetwork. In addition to 
the network address, network protocols use some form of host, or node, address. For 
some network layer protocols, a network administrator assigns host addresses accord-
ing to some predetermined network addressing plan. For other network layer protocols, 
assigning host addresses is partially or completely dynamic or automatic. Figure 8-12 
shows three devices in Network 1 (two workstations and a router), each with its own 
unique host address. (The ﬁgure also shows that the router is connected to two other 
networks—networks 2 and 3.)

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
439
Logical addressing occurs at the network layer. Recall the analogy that compares net-
work addresses to telephone numbers. The ﬁrst portions of a phone number are the 
area code and the ﬁrst three digits. The last four digits of a phone number tell the phone 
company equipment which speciﬁc phone to ring. This is similar to the function of 
the host portion of an address. The host portion tells the router the speciﬁc device to 
which it should deliver a packet.
Without network layer addressing, routing cannot take place. Routers require network 
addresses to ensure proper delivery of packets. Without some hierarchical addressing 
structure, packets could not travel across an internetwork. Similarly, without some 
hierarchical structure to telephone numbers, postal addresses, or transportation systems, 
there would be no smooth delivery of goods and services.
A MAC address can be compared to your name, and a network layer address can be 
compared to your mailing address (network and host address). For example, if you 
were to move to another town, your name would remain unchanged, but your mailing 
address would indicate your new location. Network devices (routers as well as individual 
computers) have both a MAC address and a protocol (network layer) address. When 
you move a computer to a different network, the computer maintains the same MAC 
address, but you must assign it a new network layer address.
The Communication Path
The function of the network layer is to ﬁnd the best path through the network. To be 
truly practical, a network must consistently represent the paths available between routers. 
As Figure 8-13 shows, each line between the routers has a number that the routers use 
as a network address. These addresses must convey information that can be used by a 
routing process. This means that an address must have information about the path of 
media connections that the routing process uses to pass packets from a source toward 
a destination.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Using these addresses, the network layer can provide a relay connection that intercon-
nects independent networks. The consistency of Layer 3 addresses across the entire 
internetwork also improves the use of bandwidth by preventing unnecessary broadcasts. 
Broadcasts invoke unnecessary process overhead and waste capacity on any devices or 
links that do not need to receive the broadcast. By using consistent end-to-end address-
ing to represent the path of media connections, the network layer can ﬁnd a path to the 
destination without unnecessarily burdening the devices or links on the internetwork 
with broadcasts.
Routing Tables
To aid in the process of path determination, routing protocols build and maintain 
routing tables, which contain route information, as shown in Figure 8-14. Route infor-
mation varies, depending on the routing protocol used. Routing protocols ﬁll routing 
tables with a variety of information.
Figure 8-14 Routing Tables
Routers keep track of important information in their routing tables:
■Protocol type—The type of routing protocol that created the routing table entry.
■Destination/next-hop associations—Tell a router that a particular destination is 
either directly connected to the router or that it can be reached via another router 
called the next hop on the way to the ﬁnal destination. When a router receives an 
incoming packet, it checks the destination address and attempts to match it with 
a routing table entry.

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols
441
■Routing metrics—Different routing protocols use different routing metrics. Routing 
metrics are used to determine a route’s desirability. For example, RIP uses hop
count as its routing metric. IGRP uses bandwidth, load, delay, and reliability to 
create a composite metric value. This is covered in more depth in CCNA2.
■Outbound interface—The interface that the data must be sent out to reach the 
ﬁnal destination.
Routers communicate with one another to maintain their routing tables through the 
transmission of routing update messages. Depending on the particular routing protocol, 
routing update messages can be sent periodically or only when there is a change in the 
network topology. The routing protocol also determines whether just the changed 
routes or the entire routing table is sent in the routing update. By analyzing the routing 
updates from the neighboring routers, a router can build and maintain its routing table.
Routing Algorithms and Metrics
Routing protocols often have one or more of the following design goals:
■Optimization—Optimization describes the capability of the routing protocol/
algorithm to select the best route, depending on metrics and metric weightings 
used in the calculation. For example, one algorithm might use hop count and 
delay for its metric but might weigh delay more heavily in the calculation.
■Simplicity and low overhead—Ideally efﬁcient routing algorithm functionality is 
achieved if the routers have minimum CPU and memory overhead. This is impor-
tant so that the network can scale to large proportions, such as the Internet.
■Robustness and stability—A routing algorithm should perform correctly in the 
face of unusual or unforeseen circumstances, such as hardware failures, high 
load conditions, and implementation errors.
■Rapid convergence—Convergence is the process of all routers agreeing on routes. 
When a network event causes changes in router availability, recalculations are 
needed to reestablish network connectivity. Routing algorithms that converge 
slowly can cause data to not be delivered.
■Flexibility—A routing algorithm should quickly adapt to a variety of network 
changes. These changes include router availability, changes in bandwidth, queue 
size, and network delay.
■Scalability—Some routing protocols are better designed for scalability than others. 
It is important to keep in mind that if the network is intended to grow (or even if 
this option is to be left open), a routing protocol such as EIGRP rather than RIP 
should be used.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
When a routing algorithm updates a routing table, its primary objective is to determine 
the best information to include in the table. Routing algorithms use different metrics 
to determine the best route. Each routing algorithm interprets what is best in its own 
way. The routing algorithm generates a number, called the metric value, for each path 
through the network. Sophisticated routing algorithms can base route selection on 
multiple metrics, combining them in a single composite metric, as shown in Figure 8-15. 
Typically, the smaller the metric, the better the path.
Figure 8-15 Routing Metrics
Metrics can be based on a single characteristic of a path or can be calculated based on 
several characteristics. The metrics that are most commonly used by routing protocols 
are as follows:
■Bandwidth—A link’s data capacity. (Normally, a 10-Mbps Ethernet link is pref-
erable to a 64-kbps leased line.)
■Delay—The length of time required to move a packet along each link from 
source to destination. Delay depends on the bandwidth of intermediate links, 
port queues at each router, network congestion, and physical distance.
■Load—The amount of activity on a network resource such as a router or link.
■Reliability—Usually refers to the error rate of each network link.
■Hop count—The number of routers that a packet must travel through before 
reaching its destination. Whenever data goes through a router, this is one hop. 
A path that has a hop count of 4 indicates that data traveling along that path 
passes through four routers before reaching its ﬁnal destination. If there are mul-
tiple paths to a destination, the router chooses the path with the fewest hops.

■Cost—An arbitrary value, usually based on bandwidth, monetary expense, or 
another measurement, that is assigned by a network administrator.
Interior and Exterior Routing Protocols
Routers use routing protocols to exchange routing information. In other words, routing 
protocols determine how routed protocols are routed. Two families of routing protocols 
are the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) and the Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs),
as shown in Figure 8-16. These families are classiﬁed based on how they operate with 
regard to autonomous systems.
Figure 8-16 IGPs and EGPs
An autonomous system is a network or set of networks that are under the administra-
tive control of a single entity, such as the cisco.com domain. An autonomous system 
consists of routers that present a consistent view of routing to the external world. The 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates autonomous system numbers 
to the regional registries. These registries are ARIN (hostmaster@arin.net) for the 
Americas, the Caribbean, and Africa; RIPE-NCC (ncc@ripe.net) for Europe; and 
AP-NIC (admin@apnic.net) for the Asia Paciﬁc region. This autonomous system is a 
16-bit number. A routing protocol such as BGP requires that you specify this unique, 
assigned autonomous system number in your conﬁguration.
IGPs route data within an autonomous system. Here are some examples of IGPs:

■OSPF
■Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol
EGPs route data between autonomous systems. BGP is the most pervasive example of 
an EGP.
Routing Protocols
Routing protocols can be classiﬁed in many different ways, such as IGPs or EGPs. Another 
classiﬁcation that describes routing protocols is distance-vector or link-state. Whereas IGP 
and EGP describe the physical relationships of routers, the distance-vector and link-state 
categories describe how routers interact with each other in terms of routing updates.
Distance-Vector Protocols
The distance-vector routing approach determines the direction (vector) and distance 
(hop count) to any link in the internetwork. Distance-vector algorithms periodically 
(such as every 30 seconds) send all or some portion of their routing table to their adjacent 
neighbors. Routers running a distance-vector routing protocol send periodic updates 
even if there are no changes in the network. By receiving a neighbor’s routing table, a 
router can verify all the known routes and make changes to the local routing table based 
on updated information received from the neighboring router. This process is called 
“routing by rumor” because the understanding that a router has of the network is 
based on the neighbor’s perspective of the network topology. Distance-vector protocols 
use the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to calculate the best paths.
Examples of distance-vector protocols include the following:
■Routing Information Protocol (RIP)—The most common IGP in the Internet, 
RIP uses hop count as its routing metric.
■Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)—Cisco developed this IGP to 
address the issues associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks.
Link-State Protocols
Link-state routing protocols were designed to overcome the limitations of distance-
vector routing protocols. Link-state routing protocols respond quickly to network changes, 
send trigger updates only when a network change has occurred, and send periodic 
updates (called link-state refreshes) at long time intervals, such as every 30 minutes.
When a link changes state, the device that detected the change creates a link-state 
advertisement (LSA) concerning that link (route), and that LSA is propagated to all 
neighboring devices. Each routing device takes a copy of the LSA, updates its link-
state (topological) database, and forwards the LSA to all neighboring devices. This 
1102.book  Page 444  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Routed, Routable, and Routing Protocols

ﬂooding of the LSA is required to ensure that all routing devices update their data-
bases before creating an updated routing table that reﬂects the new topology, as 
shown in Figure 8-17.
Figure 8-17 Link-State Routing Protocols
The link-state database is used to calculate the best paths through the network. Link-
state routers ﬁnd the best paths to destinations by applying the Dijkstra Shortest Path 
First (SPF) algorithm against the link-state database to build the SPF tree. The best 
(shortest) paths are then selected from the shortest-path-ﬁrst tree and are placed in the 
routing table.
Examples of link-state protocols are OSPF and IS-IS, as shown in Figure 8-18.

The following sections describe the metrics, network usability, and other signiﬁcant 
characteristics of the most commonly used routing protocols.

Figure 8-18 Link-State Routing Protocols: OSPF and IS-IS
RIP
RIP uses hop count to determine the direction and distance to any link in the internet-
work, as shown in Figure 8-19. If there are multiple paths to a destination, RIP selects 
the path with the fewest hops. However, because hop count is the only routing metric 
RIP uses, it does not necessarily select the fastest path to a destination. RIP-1 uses only 
classful routing. This means that all devices in the network must use the same subnet 
mask, because RIP-1 does not include the subnet information with the routing update.
RIP-2 provides what is called preﬁx routing and sends subnet mask information with 
the route updates. This supports the use of classless routing. With classless routing 
protocols, different subnets within the same network can have different subnet masks. 
The use of different subnet masks within the same network is called variable-length 
subnet masking (VLSM).
IGRP
IGRP is a distance-vector routing protocol developed by Cisco speciﬁcally to address 
problems associated with routing in large networks that are beyond the scope of pro-
tocols such as RIP. IGRP can select the fastest path based on the delay, bandwidth, load, 
and reliability. By default, IGRP uses bandwidth and delay metrics only and uses a 
24-bit metric. IGRP also has a much higher maximum hop-count limit than RIP to 
allow the network to scale. IGRP uses only classful routing.

EIGRP
Like IGRP, EIGRP is a proprietary Cisco protocol. EIGRP is an advanced version of 
IGRP and uses a 32-bit metric. Speciﬁcally, EIGRP provides superior operating efﬁ-
ciency such as faster convergence and lower overhead bandwidth. It is an advanced 
distance-vector protocol. EIGRP also uses some of the link-state protocol functions. 
Hence, the term hybrid is also used to describe EIGRP.
OSPF
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) 
developed OSPF in 1988. The most recent version, OSPF Version 2, is described in 
RFC 2328. OSPF is an IGP, which means that it distributes routing information 
between routers belonging to the same autonomous system. OSPF was written to 
address the needs of large, scalable internetworks that RIP could not.
IS-IS
Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) is the dynamic link-state routing 
protocol for the OSI protocol stack. As such, it distributes routing information for 
routing Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP) data for the ISO Connectionless

Network Service (CLNS) environment. Integrated IS-IS is an implementation of the 
IS-IS protocol for routing multiple network protocols. Integrated IS-IS tags CLNP 
routes with information about IP networks and subnets. It provides an alternative to 
OSPF in the IP world, mixing ISO CLNS and IP routing in one protocol. It can be used 
purely for IP routing, purely for ISO routing, or for a combination of the two.
BGP
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an example of an EGP. BGP exchanges routing 
information between autonomous systems while guaranteeing loop-free path selection. 
It is the principal route advertising protocol used by major companies and ISPs on the 
Internet. BGP-4 is the ﬁrst version of BGP that supports classless interdomain routing 
(CIDR) and route aggregation. Unlike common IGPs such as RIP, OSPF, and EIGRP, 
BGP does not use metrics such as hop count or bandwidth or delay. Instead, BGP 
makes routing decisions based on network policies or rules using various BGP path 
attributes.
IP as a Routed Protocol
IP is the most widely used implementation of a hierarchical network addressing scheme. 
IP is a connectionless, unreliable, best-effort delivery system protocol used on the Inter-
net. The term connectionless means that no dedicated circuit connection is required, as 
there would be for a telephone call. There is no call setup before data is transferred 
between hosts. The IP protocol takes whichever route is the most efﬁcient based on the 
routing protocol decision. Unreliable and best-effort do not mean that the system is 
unreliable and doesn’t work well, but that the IP protocol does not make any effort to 
see if the packet was delivered. This function is handled by the upper-layer protocols.
As information ﬂows down the layers of the OSI model, the data is processed at each 
layer. At the network layer, the data is encapsulated within packets called datagrams,
as shown in Figure 8-20.
Lab Activity
Small Router Purchase (Cable/DSL Router)
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the variety and prices of network 
components in the market. This lab looks speciﬁcally at small routers used 
by telecommuters when working from home.
NOTE
CLNP refers to the 
OSI network layer 
protocol that does not 
require a circuit to be 
established before 
data is transmitted.

Figure 8-20 Encapsulation
IP determines the form of the IP packet header (which includes addressing and other 
control information) but does not concern itself with the actual data. It accepts what-
ever is passed down from the higher layers, as shown in Figure 8-21.
Figure 8-21 IP Header
Packet Propagation and Switching Within a Router
As a packet travels through an internetwork to get to its ﬁnal destination, the frame’s 
headers and trailers are stripped and replaced at every router (Layer 3) device, as shown 
in Figure 8-22. The reason for this is that Layer 2 units (frames) are for local address-
ing and Layer 3 units (packets) are for end-to-end addressing.
Layer 2 Ethernet frames are meant to work within a broadcast domain and to work 
with the MAC addresses that are assigned to the physical devices. Other Layer 2 frame 
types include point-to-point serial links and Frame Relay WAN connections that use 
their own Layer 2 addressing scheme. The main point is that no matter what type of 
Layer 2 addressing is used, it is designed to stay within a Layer 2 broadcast domain. 
As the data crosses a Layer 3 device, the Layer 2 information changes.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Figure 8-22 Network Layer Device Data Flow
The exact process that is performed at a Layer 3 device is detailed in Figure 8-23 and 
the following paragraph.
As a frame is accepted at a router interface, the destination MAC address is extracted 
and checked, as is done by all devices in a collision domain, to see if the frame is 
directly addressed to the interface or is a broadcast. In either of these cases, the packet 
is accepted; otherwise, it is discarded, because it was destined for another device on the 
collision domain. The accepted frame has the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) extracted 
from the frame trailer and is calculated to verify that the frame arrived without error 
at the interface. If the check fails, the frame is discarded. If the check is valid, the frame 
header and trailer are stripped, and the packet is passed up to Layer 3. The packet is 
then checked to see if it is destined for the router or is to be routed to another device 
in the internetwork. The types of packets that are destined for the router have an IP 
address of one of the router interfaces as the destination IP address. This packet has 
the Layer 3 header stripped and passed up to Layer 4. If the packet is to be routed, the 
destination IP address is compared to the routing table. If a match is found or there is 
a default route, the packet is sent to the interface speciﬁed in the matching routing 
table statement.

Figure 8-23 Encapsulation Changes in a Router
When the packet is switched to the outgoing interface, a new CRC value is added as a 
frame trailer, and, depending on the type of interface (Ethernet, serial, or Frame Relay), 
the proper frame header is added to the packet. The frame is then transmitted to the 
next broadcast domain for the next part of the trip to the ﬁnal destination.
Connectionless Versus Connection-Oriented Network Services
Most OSI model network services use a connectionless delivery system (TCP), as shown 
in Figure 8-24. They treat each packet separately and send it on its way through the 
network. The packets might take different paths to get through the network, but they 
are reassembled when they arrive at the destination. In a connectionless system, the 
destination is not contacted before a packet is sent. A good analogy for a connectionless 
system is the postal system. The recipient is not contacted before a letter is sent from 
one destination to another. The letter is sent on its way, and the recipient learns of the 
letter when it arrives.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Figure 8-24 Connectionless Delivery System for Network Services
Connectionless network processes are often referred to as being packet-switched. In 
these processes, as the packets pass from source to destination, they can switch to dif-
ferent paths, as well as (possibly) arrive out of order. Devices make the path determi-
nation for each packet based on a variety of criteria. Some of the criteria (such as 
available bandwidth) might differ from packet to packet.
The Internet is a huge connectionless internetwork in which all packet deliveries are 
handled by IP. TCP (Layer 4) adds connection-oriented and reliable services on top of 
IP (Layer 3). TCP segments are encapsulated into IP packets for transport across the 
Internet.
IP is a connectionless system; it treats each packet independently. For example, if you 
use an FTP program to download a ﬁle, IP does not send the ﬁle in one long stream of 
data; it treats each packet independently. Each packet can travel different paths; some 
can even get lost. IP relies on the transport layer protocol to determine whether pack-
ets have been lost and to request retransmission. The transport layer is also responsible 
for reordering the packets.
In connection-oriented systems, a connection is established between the sender and 
the recipient before any data is transferred, as shown in Figure 8-25. An example of a 
connection-oriented network is the telephone system. You place a call, a connection is 
established, and then communication occurs. Connection-oriented network processes 
ﬁrst establish a connection with the recipient and then begin the data transfer. All packets 
travel sequentially across the same physical circuit—or, more commonly, across the 
same virtual circuit.

Anatomy of an IP Packet
The Layer 3 packet/datagram becomes Layer 2 data, which is then encapsulated into 
frames as previously discussed.
Similarly, the IP packet, shown in Figure 8-26, consists of the data from upper layers 
plus an IP header:
■Version—A 4-bit ﬁeld that indicates the version of IP currently used. All devices 
must be running the same version of IP, or the device that is different rejects the 
packets.
■IP Header Length (HLEN)—A 4-bit ﬁeld that indicates the datagram header 
length in 32-bit words. This is the total length of all header information, 
accounting for the two variable-length header ﬁelds.
■Type of Service (TOS)—An 8-bit ﬁeld that speciﬁes the level of importance that 
has been assigned by a particular upper-layer protocol.
■Total Length—A 16-bit ﬁeld that speciﬁes the length of the entire packet in bytes, 
including data and header. To get the length of the data payload, subtract the 
HLEN from the total length.
■Identiﬁcation—A 16-bit ﬁeld that contains an integer that identiﬁes the current 
datagram. This is the sequence number.
■Flags—A 3-bit ﬁeld in which the 2 low-order bits control fragmentation. The 
ﬁrst bit speciﬁes whether the packet can be fragmented, and the second bit speci-
ﬁes whether the packet is the last fragment in a series of fragmented packets.
■Fragment Offset—A 13-bit ﬁeld that helps piece together datagram fragments. 
This ﬁeld allows the Flags ﬁeld to end at a 16-bit boundary.
■Time-to-Live (TTL)—An 8-bit ﬁeld that maintains a counter that gradually 
decreases, in increments, to 0. At this point, the datagram is discarded, keeping 
the packets from looping endlessly. An example is hop count.

■Protocol—An 8-bit ﬁeld that indicates which upper-layer protocol receives 
incoming packets after IP processing has been completed. Examples are TCP 
and UDP.
■Header Checksum—A 16-bit ﬁeld that helps ensure IP header integrity.
■Source IP Address—A 32-bit ﬁeld that speciﬁes the sending node IP address.
■Destination IP Address—A 32-bit ﬁeld that speciﬁes the receiving node 
IP address.
■Options—A variable-length ﬁeld that allows IP to support various options, 
such as security.
■Padding—Extra 0s are added to this ﬁeld to ensure that the IP header is always 
a multiple of 32 bits.
■Data—A variable-length (maximum 64 Kb) ﬁeld that contains upper-layer 
information.
Figure 8-26 IP Packet Contents
The IP packet consists of upper-layer data and the header information just described. 
Although the focus of this book so far has been the IP source and destination addresses, 
the other header ﬁelds are what make IP so ﬂexible and resilient. The header ﬁelds are 
the information that is provided to the upper-layer protocols that deﬁnes the data in 
the packet. Several earlier chapters discussed the idea of layer independence; the header 
information in the preceding list is what allows that independence to happen.

The Mechanics of Subnetting

The Mechanics of Subnetting
The Internet’s original two-level hierarchy assumed that each site would have only a 
single network. Therefore, each site would need only a single connection to the Inter-
net. Initially, these were safe assumptions. Over time, however, network computing 
matured and expanded. By 1985, it was no longer safe to assume that an organization 
would have only a single network or that it would be satisﬁed with a single connection 
to the Internet.
As sites began to develop multiple networks, it became obvious to the IETF that a 
mechanism was needed to differentiate among the multiple logical networks that were 
emerging as subsets of the Internet’s second tier. Otherwise, there could be no efﬁcient 
way to route data to speciﬁc end systems in sites with multiple networks.
Introduction to and Reasons for Subnetting
To create the subnetwork structure, host bits must be reassigned as network bits by 
dividing the host octet(s). This is often called borrowing bits, but a more accurate term 
would be lending bits. The starting point for this process is always the leftmost host 
bit, dependent on the IP class.
In addition to the need for manageability, subnetworking lets the network administrator 
provide broadcast containment and low-level security on the LAN. Security, through 
subnetting on the LAN, is provided because access to other subnets is provided by a 
router. The router, as you will learn in Chapter 20, “Access Control Lists,” can be 
conﬁgured to permit or deny access to a subnet based on varied criteria, thereby pro-
viding security. Some owners of Class A and Class B networks have also discovered 
that subnetting creates a revenue source for the organization through the leasing or 
sale of previously unused IP addresses.
In such multiple-network environments, each subnetwork is connected to the Internet 
via a common point—a router, as shown in Figure 8-27. The details of the internal 
network environment are inconsequential to the Internet. They comprise a private 
network that is (or should be) capable of delivering its own datagrams. Therefore, the 
Internet must concern itself only with how to reach that network’s gateway router to 
the Internet. Inside the private network, the host portion of the IP address can be sub-
divided to create subnetworks.
Because the subnet address is taken from the host number portion of Class A, Class B, 
and Class C addresses, it is assigned locally, usually by the network administrator. 
Also, like the other portions of IP addresses, each subnet address must be unique 
within its scope, as shown in Figure 8-28.

Subnetting is frequently necessary when LANs are to be interconnected to form a WAN. 
For example, if you want to connect two LANs in geographically separate locations, 
you can assign a unique subnet to each of the LANs and to the WAN link between 
them. Two routers can then be used (one on each LAN) to route packets between the 
LANs (subnets).

The Mechanics of Subnetting
457
Another primary reason for using subnets is to reduce the size of a broadcast domain. 
Broadcasts are sent to all hosts on a network or subnetwork. When broadcast trafﬁc 
begins to consume too much of the available bandwidth, network administrators 
might choose to reduce the size of the broadcast domain.
The outside world sees a LAN as a single network with no knowledge of the internal 
network structure. This view of the network keeps the routing tables small and efﬁcient. 
Given a local node address of 192.168.10.14, the world outside the LAN sees only 
the advertised major network number of 192.168.10.0. The reason for this is that the 
local address of 192.168.10.14 is valid only within the LAN 192.168.10.0. It cannot 
function anywhere else.
Subnet addresses include the Class A, Class B, and Class C network portion, plus a 
subnet ﬁeld and a host ﬁeld. These ﬁelds are created from the original host portion 
of the major IP address by assigning bits from the host portion to the original network 
portion of the address. The ability to divide the original host portion of the address 
into the new subnet and host ﬁelds provides addressing ﬂexibility for the network 
administrator, as shown in Figures 8-29, 8-30, and 8-31. This simply means that the 
administrator has more options available when it comes to assigning an IP addressing 
scheme both initially and when it is time to expand the network.

Figure 8-31 Subdividing the Host Octets of a Class A Address
Establishing the Subnet Mask Address
Selecting the number of bits to use in the subnet process depends on the required max-
imum number of hosts per subnet. To calculate the result of using host bits to create 
subnetworks, you must understand some basic binary math and the position value of 
the bits in each octet, as shown in Table 8-2.
Regardless of the IP address class, the last 2 bits in the last octet can never be assigned 
to the subnetwork. These are called the last two signiﬁcant bits. Using all the available 
bits except these two results in subnets with only two usable hosts. This is a practical 
address conservation method for addressing serial router links. However, for a work-
ing LAN, this would result in prohibitive equipment costs.
To create the subnet mask that gives the router the information required to compute 
which subnet a particular host resides on, select the column with the number of bits 
and refer to the mask number above it, as shown later in Figure 8-35. This number is 
calculated by adding the position value of the bits used. If 3 bits were used, the mask 
for a Class C address would be 255.255.255.224, as shown in Table 8-3. This mask 
can also be illustrated in the slash format as /27. The number following the slash is the 
total number of bits in the network portion and subnet mask.

The Mechanics of Subnetting
459
To determine the number of bits to be used, the network designer needs to calculate 
how many hosts the largest subnetwork requires and the number of subnetworks. For 
example, assume that this requirement is 30 hosts and ﬁve subnetworks. To calculate 
how many bits to reassign, consult the Usable Hosts row in Table 8-4. For example, 
for 30 usable hosts, 3 bits are required. This also creates six usable subnetworks, which 
satisﬁes the requirements of this scheme. Again, the difference between usable and total 
hosts is a result of using the ﬁrst available address as the ID and the last available 
address as the broadcast for each subnetwork. Classful routing does not provide the 
capability to use these subnetworks, whereas classless routing recovers many of these 
“lost” addresses, as shown in Table 8-4. This table illustrates the loss of subnets and 
hosts when you don’t use a classless routing protocol.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
An alternative way to compute the subnet mask and the number of networks is to use 
the following formulae:
The number of usable subnets equals 2 to the power of the assigned subnet bits 
minus 2:
(2power of bits assigned) – 2 = usable subnets
For example, 23 – 2 = 6
The number of usable hosts equals 2 to the power of the bits remaining minus 2:
(2power of bits remaining) – 2 = usable hosts
For example, 25 – 2 = 30
Creating a Subnet
To create subnets, you must extend the routing portion of the address. The Internet 
“knows” your network as a whole, identiﬁed by the Class A, B, or C address, which 
deﬁnes 8, 16, or 24 routing bits (the network number). The subnet ﬁeld represents 
additional routing bits so that the routers within your organization can recognize dif-
ferent locations, or subnets, within the whole network.
Subnet masks use the same format as IP addresses. In other words, each subnet mask 
is 32 bits long and is divided into four octets. Subnet masks have all 1s in the network 
and subnetwork portion and all 0s in the host portion. By default, if no bits are bor-
rowed, the subnet mask for a Class B network is 255.255.0.0. However, if 8 bits were 
borrowed, the subnet mask for the same Class B network would be 255.255.255.0, 
as shown in Figures 8-32 and 8-33. However, because there are two octets in the host 
ﬁeld of a Class B network, up to 14 bits can be borrowed to create subnetworks. A 
Class C network has only one octet in the host ﬁeld. Therefore, only up to 6 bits can 
be borrowed in Class C networks to create subnetworks.
The subnet ﬁeld always immediately follows the network number. That is, the borrowed 
bits must be the ﬁrst n bits of the default host ﬁeld, where n is the desired size of the new 
subnet ﬁeld, as shown in Figure 8-34. The subnet mask is the tool used by the router to 
determine which bits are routing bits and which bits are host bits.
Determining Subnet Mask Size
Again, subnet masks contain all 1s in the network bit positions (determined by the 
address class) as well as the subnet bit positions, and they contain all 0s in the remain-
ing bit positions, designating them as the host portion of an address.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
By default, if you borrow no bits, the subnet mask for a Class B network would be 
255.255.0.0, which is the dotted-decimal equivalent of 1s in the 16 bits corresponding 
to the Class B network number and 0s in the other 16 bits.
If 8 bits were borrowed for the subnet ﬁeld, the subnet mask would include 8 additional 
1 bits and would become 255.255.255.0. For example, if the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 
were associated with the Class B address 130.5.2.144 (8 bits borrowed for subnetting), 
the router would know to route this packet to subnet 130.5.2.0 rather than just to net-
work 130.5.0.0, as shown in Figure 8-35.
Figure 8-35 Subnet Masking: Class B Address
Another example is the Class C address 197.15.22.131 with a subnet mask of 
255.255.255.224. With a value of 224 in the ﬁnal octet (11100000 in binary), the 
24-bit Class C network portion has been extended by 3 bits to make the total 27 bits. The 
131 in the last octet presents the third usable host address in the subnet 197.15.22.128, as 
shown in Figure 8-36. The routers in the Internet (that don’t know the subnet mask) 
only worry about routing to the Class C network 197.15.22.0. The routers inside that 
network, knowing the subnet mask, look at 27 bits to make a routing decision.
Figure 8-36 Subnet Masking: Class C Address
Computing the Subnet Mask and IP Address
Whenever you borrow bits from the host ﬁeld, it is important to note the number of 
additional subnets that are being created each time you borrow one more bit. You have 
already learned that you cannot borrow only 1 bit; the fewest you can borrow is 2. 
Borrowing 2 bits creates four possible subnets (2 × 2) (but you must remember that 
there are two reserved/unusable subnets). Each time you borrow another bit from the

The Mechanics of Subnetting

host ﬁeld, the number of subnets created increases by a power of 2. Eight possible sub-
nets are created by borrowing 3 bits (2 × 2 × 2). Sixteen possible subnets are created by 
borrowing 4 bits (2 × 2 × 2 × 2). From these examples and from the binary conversion 
chart that was shown in Figure 8-33, it is easy to see that each time you borrow another 
bit from the host ﬁeld, the number of possible subnets doubles.
Computing Hosts Per Subnetwork
Each time you borrow 1 bit from a host ﬁeld, there is 1 less bit remaining that can be 
used for host numbers. Speciﬁcally, each time you borrow another bit from the host 
ﬁeld, the number of host addresses that you can assign decreases by a power of 2 (gets 
cut in half).
To understand how this works, consider a Class C network address. If there is no sub-
net mask, all 8 bits in the last octet are used for the host ﬁeld. Therefore, 256 (28)
possible addresses are available to assign to hosts (254 usable addresses after you 
subtract the two you know you can’t use). Now, imagine that this Class C network 
is divided into subnets. If you borrow 2 bits from the default 8-bit host ﬁeld, the host 
ﬁeld decreases in size to 6 bits. If you wrote out all the possible combinations of 0s and 
1s that could occur in the remaining 6 bits, you would discover that the total number 
of possible hosts that could be assigned in each subnet would be reduced to 64 (26).
The number of usable host numbers would be reduced to 62.
In the same Class C network, if you borrow 3 bits, the size of the host ﬁeld decreases 
to 5 bits, and the total number of hosts you can assign to each subnet is reduced to 
32 (25). The number of usable host numbers decreases to 30.
The number of possible host addresses that can be assigned to a subnet is related to 
the number of subnets that have been created. In a Class C network, for example, if 
a subnet mask of 255.255.255.224 has been applied, 3 bits (224 in decimal equals 
11100000 in binary) are borrowed from the host ﬁeld. Six usable subnets are created 
(8 – 2), each having 30 (32 – 2) usable host addresses.
Calculating the Resident Subnetwork Through ANDing
As mentioned earlier, the network or subnet address has all 0s in the host portion. To 
route a data packet, the router must ﬁrst determine the destination network/subnet 
address. To accomplish this, the router performs a logical AND using the destination 
host’s IP address and the subnet mask for that network.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
Imagine that you have a Class B network with the network number 172.16.0.0. After 
assessing your network’s needs, you decide to borrow 8 bits to create subnets. As you 
learned earlier, when you borrow 8 bits with a Class B network, the subnet mask is 
255.255.255.0, as shown in Figure 8-37.
Figure 8-37 8 Bits of Subnetting
Someone outside the network sends data to the IP address 172.16.2.120. To determine 
where to deliver the data, the router ANDs this address with the subnet mask.
When the two numbers are ANDed, the host portion of the result is always 0. What 
is left is the network number, including the subnet. Thus, the data is sent to subnet 
172.16.2.0, and only the ﬁnal router notices that the packet should be delivered to 
host 120 in that subnet.
Now, imagine that you have the same network, 172.16.0.0. This time, however, you 
decide to borrow only 7 bits for the subnet ﬁeld. The binary subnet mask for this is 
11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000. What is this in dotted-decimal notation?
Again, someone outside the network sends data to host 172.16.2.120. To determine 
where to send the data, the router again ANDs this address with the subnet mask. As 
before, when the two numbers are ANDed, the host portion of the result is 0. So what 
is different in this second example? Everything looks the same—at least, in decimal. 
The difference is in the number of subnets available and the number of hosts available 
per subnet. You can see this only by comparing the two different subnet masks, as 
shown in Figure 8-38.

Summary
465
With 7 bits in the subnet ﬁeld, there can be only 126 subnets. How many hosts can 
there be in each subnet? How long is the host ﬁeld? With 9 bits for host numbers, there 
can be 510 hosts in each of those 126 subnets.

■The differences between, mechanics of, and characteristics of routing and routed 
protocols.

usable subnets and hosts. You also use the ANDing process to determine if a 
destination IP address is local or remote. Finally, you identify valid and invalid 
IP host addresses based on a given a network number and subnet mask.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
■To provide extra ﬂexibility for the network administrator, networks—particu-
larly large ones—are often divided into smaller networks called subnetworks or 
subnets. Subnetting allows a network administrator to get around the limitations 
of availability of IP addresses by dividing a single network address into many 
subnets visible only within that single network.
■The function of a subnet mask is to tell devices which part of an address is the 
network number, including the subnet, and which part is the host.
■Internetworking functions of the network layer include network addressing and 
best-path selection for data trafﬁc.
■How to explain IP addressing, IP address classes, reserved IP address space, 
private IP address space, and IP subnetting.

a particular source to a particular destination.
autonomous system
A network or set of networks that are under the administrative

broadcast domain
A set of all devices that receive broadcast frames originating from 
any device within the set. Broadcast domains are typically bounded by routers (or, in a 
switched network, by VLANs) because routers do not forward broadcast frames.
classless interdomain routing (CIDR)
A technique supported by BGP and based on

of routing information carried by the core routers. With CIDR, several IP networks 
appear to networks outside the group as a single, larger entity.

In Ethernet, the network area within which frames that have collided 
are propagated. Repeaters and hubs propagate collisions; LAN switches, bridges, and 
routers do not.

call for each router to send its entire routing table in each update, but only to its 
neighbors. Distance-vector routing algorithms can be prone to routing loops but are 
computationally simpler than link-state routing algorithms. Also called the Bellman-
Ford routing algorithm.
Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
An Internet protocol used to exchange routing 
information between autonomous systems. Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the 
most common EGP.

Chapter 8: Routing Fundamentals and Subnets
hop
The passage of a data packet from one network node, typically a router, to 
another.
hop count
A routing metric used to measure the distance between a source and a 
destination. RIP uses hop count as its sole metric.
Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
An Internet protocol used to exchange routing 
information within an autonomous system. Examples of common Internet IGPs are 
IGRP, OSPF, and RIP.
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
An IGP developed by Cisco to address 
the problems associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks.
IP address
A 32-bit address assigned to hosts using TCP/IP. An IP address belongs 
to one of ﬁve classes (A, B, C, D, or E) and is written as four octets separated by periods 
(that is, dotted-decimal format). Each address consists of a network number, an optional 
subnetwork number, and a host number. The network and subnetwork numbers 
together are used for routing, and the host number is used to address an individual 
host within the network or subnetwork. A subnet mask is used to extract network and 
subnetwork information from the IP address. CIDR provides a new way to represent 
IP addresses and subnet masks. Also called an Internet address.
MAC address
A standardized data link layer address that is required for every device 
that connects to a LAN. Other devices in the network use these addresses to locate 
speciﬁc devices in the network and to create and update routing tables and data struc-
tures. MAC addresses are 6 bytes long and are controlled by the IEEE. Also called a 
hardware address, MAC-layer address, or physical address.
NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI)
An enhanced version of the NetBIOS 
protocol used by network operating systems such as LAN Manager, LAN Server, 
Windows for Workgroups, and Windows NT. NetBEUI formalizes the transport frame 
and adds functions. NetBEUI implements the OSI LLC2 protocol.
octet
8 bits. In networking, the term octet is often used (rather than byte) because 
some machine architectures employ bytes that are not 8 bits long.
packet
A logical grouping of information that includes a header containing control 
information and (usually) user data. Packets most often refer to network-layer units of 
data. The terms datagram, frame, message, and segment also describe logical informa-
tion groupings at various layers of the OSI reference model and in various technology 
circles.

Key Terms
469
protocol stack
A set of related communications protocols that operate together and, 
as a group, address communication at some or all of the seven layers of the OSI refer-
ence model. Not every protocol stack covers each layer of the model, and often a single 
protocol in the stack addresses a number of layers at once. TCP/IP is a typical protocol 
stack.
routed protocol
Any network protocol that provides enough information in its net-
work layer address to allow a packet to be forwarded from one host to another host 
based on the addressing scheme.
router
A network-layer device that uses one or more metrics to determine the optimal 
path along which network trafﬁc should be forwarded. Routers forward packets from 
one network to another based on network-layer information contained in routing 
updates. Occasionally called a gateway (although this deﬁnition of gateway is becoming 
increasingly outdated).
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
An IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet. RIP uses hop count as a routing metric.
routing metric
A method by which a routing algorithm determines that one route is 
better than another. This information is stored in routing tables and is sent in routing 
updates. Metrics include bandwidth, communication cost, delay, hop count, load, 
MTU, path cost, and reliability. Sometimes simply called a metric.
routing protocol
A protocol that accomplishes routing through the implementation of 
a speciﬁc routing algorithm. Examples of routing protocols are IGRP, OSPF, and RIP.
routing table
A table stored in a router or some other internetworking device that 
keeps track of routes to particular network destinations and, in some cases, metrics 
associated with those routes.
subnet address
A portion of an IP address that is speciﬁed as the subnetwork by the 
subnet mask.
subnet mask
A 32-bit address mask used in IP to indicate the bits of an IP address 
that are used for the subnet address. Sometimes simply called a mask.
subnetwork
1. In IP networks, a network sharing a particular subnet address. Sub-
networks are networks arbitrarily segmented by a network administrator to provide 
a multilevel, hierarchical routing structure while shielding the subnetwork from the 
addressing complexity of attached networks. Sometimes called a subnet. 2. In OSI net-
works, a collection of ESs and ISs under the control of a single administrative domain 
and using a single network access protocol.

Chapter 9
TCP/IP Transport and 
Application Layer
The transport layer uses the services provided by the network layer, such as best-path 
selection and logical addressing, to provide end-to-end communication between source 
and destination. This chapter describes how the transport layer regulates the ﬂow of 
information from source to destination reliably and accurately. The primary characteristics 
of the transport layer are discussed, including the following:
■The transport layer data stream is a logical connection between the endpoints of a 
network.
■End-to-end control and reliability are provided by sliding windows, sequencing 
numbers, and acknowledgments.
■Layer 4 protocols TCP and UDP use port numbers to keep track of different conver-
sations that cross the network at the same time, and to pass information to the 
upper layers.
The primary characteristics of the TCP/IP application layer include the following: 
■End-user applications reside at this layer. 
■Commonly used applications include NFS, DNS, ARP, rlogin, talk, FTP, NTP, and 
traceroute.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
Understanding the TCP/IP Transport Layer
The phrase “quality of service” often is used to describe the purpose of Layer 4, the 
transport layer. UDP, which is covered later, also operates at Layer 4 and provides con-
nectionless transport services. However, the primary protocol operating at this layer 
is connection-oriented TCP. Its main function is to transport and regulate the ﬂow of 
information from source to destination reliably and accurately. The primary duties of 
the transport layer are to provide end-to-end control, to provide ﬂow control via slid-
ing windows, and to ensure reliability via sequencing numbers and acknowledgments.
To understand reliability and ﬂow control, think of a person who speaks really fast. In 
conversation, the listener might need to ask this person to repeat some words if they 
are not understood (for reliability) and to speak slowly, so the listener can catch the 
words (ﬂow control), as shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1 Transport Layer Analogies
The transport layer provides transport services from the source host to the destina-
tion host. It constitutes a logical connection between the endpoints of the network. 
Transport services segment and reassemble data that is sent by several upper-layer 
applications onto the same transport layer data stream. This transport layer data 
stream provides end-to-end transport services.
The transport layer data stream is a logical connection between the endpoints of a net-
work. The transport layer deﬁnes end-to-end connectivity between host applications. 
Figure 9-2 illustrates the transport layer.

Figure 9-2 Transport Layer Role in Communication Between Network Devices
The transport layer provides the following basic services: 
■Segmenting upper-layer application data
■Establishing end-to-end operations
■Sending segments from one end host to another end host
■Ensuring ﬂow control provided by sliding windows
■Ensuring reliability provided by sequence numbers and acknowledgments 
The transport layer assumes that it can use the network as a “cloud,” to send data 
packets from source to destination. The cloud deals with issues of which of several 
paths is best for a given route. This starts to illustrate the role that routers perform 
in this process.
TCP/IP is a combination of two individual protocols, TCP and IP. IP is a Layer 3 pro-
tocol, a connectionless service that provides best-effort delivery across a network. TCP 
is a Layer 4 protocol, a connection-oriented service that provides ﬂow control as well 
as reliability. Pairing the protocols enables them to provide a wider range of services. 
The TCP/IP protocol suite is made up of many protocols, but TCP and IP are the key 
ones. TCP/IP is the protocol suite on which the Internet is based.
Flow Control
As the TCP transport layer protocol sends data segments, it can ensure the integrity 
of the data. One method of doing this is called ﬂow control. Flow control avoids the 
problem of a transmitting host overﬂowing the buffers in the receiving host. Overﬂows 
can present serious problems because they can result in the loss of data.
Transport layer services enable reliable data transport between hosts and destinations. 
To obtain such reliable transport of data, a connection-oriented relationship is used

between the communicating end systems. Reliable transport can accomplish the 
following:
■Ensure that segments delivered will be acknowledged to the sender
■Provide for retransmission of any segments that are not acknowledged
■Put segments back into their correct sequence at the destination
■Provide congestion avoidance and control
Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination Overview
In the OSI and TCP/IP reference models, multiple applications can share the same 
transport connection. Transport functionality is accomplished segment by segment. 
This means that different applications can send data segments on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-
served basis. Such segments can be intended for the same destination or for different 
destinations. This setup sometimes is referred to as the multiplexing of upper-layer 
conversations, as shown in Figure 9-3. 
Figure 9-3 Multiple Types of Application Layer Data Share the Transport Layer 
One function of the transport layer is to establish a connection-oriented session with 
its peer system. For data transfer to begin, both the sending and the receiving applica-
tions inform their respective operating systems that a connection will be initiated. One 
machine initiates a connection that must be accepted by the other. Protocol software 
modules in the two operating systems communicate by sending messages across the 
network to verify that the transfer is authorized and that both sides are ready.
After all synchronization has occurred, a connection is said to be established and the 
transfer of data begins. During transfer, the two machines continue to communicate 
with their protocol software to verify that data is received correctly.
Figure 9-4 shows a typical connection between sending and receiving systems. The ﬁrst 
handshake requests synchronization. The second and third handshakes acknowledge

the initial synchronization request, as well as synchronize connection parameters in the 
opposite direction. The ﬁnal handshake segment is an acknowledgment used to inform 
the destination that both sides agree that a connection has been established. After the 
connection is established, data transfer begins.
Figure 9-4 Establishing a Connection with a Peer System
When data transfer is in progress, congestion can occur for two reasons. First, a high-
speed computer might be capable of generating trafﬁc faster than a network can trans-
fer it. Second, if many computers simultaneously need to send datagrams to a single 
destination, that destination can experience congestion, although no single source 
caused the problem.
When datagrams arrive too quickly for a host or gateway to process, they temporarily 
are stored in memory. If the trafﬁc continues, the host or gateway eventually exhausts 
its memory and must discard additional datagrams that arrive.
Instead of allowing data to be lost, the transport function can issue a “not ready” indi-
cator to the sender. Acting like a stop sign, this indicator signals the sender to stop 
sending data. When the receiver can handle additional data, the receiver sends a “ready” 
transport indicator, which is like a go signal. When it receives this indicator, the sender 
can resume segment transmission.
At the end of data transfer, the sending host sends a signal that indicates the end of the 
transmission. The receiving host at the end of the data sequence acknowledges the end 
of transmission, and the connection is terminated.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
Three-Way Handshake 
TCP is connection-oriented, so it requires connection establishment before data transfer 
begins. For a connection to be established or initialized, the two hosts must synchronize 
on each other’s initial sequence numbers (ISNs). Synchronization is done in an exchange 
of connection-establishing segments that carry a control bit called SYN (for synchro-
nize) and the ISNs. Segments that carry the SYN bit also are called SYNs. Hence, the 
solution requires a suitable mechanism for picking an initial sequence number and a 
slightly involved handshake to exchange the ISNs.
The synchronization requires each side to send its own initial sequence number and to 
receive a conﬁrmation of it in an acknowledgment (ACK) from the other side. Each 
side also must receive the other side’s INS and send a conﬁrming ACK. The sequence 
follows:
1. A→B SYN—My initial sequence number is X, the ACK number is 0, and the 
SYN bit is set, but the ACK bit is not set.
2. B→A ACK—Your sequence number is X+1, my initial sequence number is Y, 
and the SYN and ACK bits are set.
3. A→B ACK—Your sequence number is Y+1, my sequence number is X+1, and 
the ACK bit is set, but the SYN bit is not set.
This exchange, shown in Figure 9-5, is called the three-way handshake.

Windowing
483
A three-way handshake is an asynchronous connection mechanism, which is necessary 
because sequence numbers are not tied to a global clock in the network; therefore, TCP 
protocols can have different mechanisms for picking the ISN. The three-way hand-
shake addresses a lot more issues than just the sequence numbers. Other issues that are 
addressed include window size, MTU, and any network latency to expect. The receiver 
of the ﬁrst SYN has no way of knowing whether the segment was an old delayed one, 
unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the connection (which is not 
always possible), so it must ask the sender to verify this SYN.
Windowing
In the most basic form of reliable, connection-oriented data transfer, data packets must 
be delivered to the recipient in the same order in which they were transmitted. The 
protocol fails if any data packets are lost, damaged, duplicated, or received in a differ-
ent order. The basic solution is to have a recipient acknowledge the receipt of each 
data segment. 
If the sender must wait for an acknowledgment after sending each segment, as shown 
in Figure 9-6, throughput is low. Therefore, most connection-oriented, reliable proto-
cols allow more than one frame or segment to be outstanding at a time. Because time is 
available after the sender ﬁnishes transmitting the data packet and before the sender 
ﬁnishes processing any received acknowledgment, the interval is used for transmitting 
more data. The number of data packets that the sender is allowed to have outstanding 
without having received an acknowledgment is known as the window.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
TCP uses expectational acknowledgments, meaning that the acknowledgment number 
refers to the octet that is expected next. Windowing refers to the fact that the window 
size is negotiated dynamically during the TCP session. Windowing is a ﬂow-control 
mechanism requiring that the source device receive an acknowledgment from the desti-
nation after transmitting a certain amount of data. 
To govern the ﬂow of data between devices, TCP uses a ﬂow-control mechanism. The 
receiving TCP device reports a “window” to the sending TCP device. This window 
speciﬁes the number of octets, starting with the acknowledgment number, that the 
receiving TCP device currently is capable of receiving.
For example, with a window size of 3, the source device can send three octets to the 
destination. It then must wait for an acknowledgment. If the destination receives the three 
octets, it sends an acknowledgment to the source device, which now can transmit three more 
octets. If the destination does not receive the three octets—for example, because of 
overﬂowing buffers—it does not send an acknowledgment. Because the source does 
not receive an acknowledgment, it knows that the octets should be retransmitted and 
that the transmission rate should be slowed.
TCP window sizes are variable during the lifetime of a connection. Each acknowledg-
ment contains a window advertisement that indicates the number of bytes that the 
receiver can accept. TCP also maintains a congestion-control window, which is nor-
mally the same size as the receiver’s window but is cut in half when a segment is lost 
(for example, there is congestion). This approach permits the window to be expanded 
or contracted as necessary to manage buffer space and processing. A larger window 
size controls the permissible number of octets that can be transmitted.
If the sender sends three octets, it is expecting an ACK of 4. If the receiver can handle 
a window size of only two octets , it drops packet 3, speciﬁes 3 as the next octet, and 
speciﬁes a new window size of 2. The sender sends the next two octets but still speciﬁes 
its own window size of 3 (for example, it still can accept three octets from the receiver). 
The receiver replies by requesting octet 5 and specifying a window size of 2.
Acknowledgment
Reliable delivery guarantees that a stream of data sent from one machine is delivered 
through a data link to another machine without duplication or data loss. Positive 
acknowledgment with retransmission is one technique that guarantees reliable delivery 
of data. Positive acknowledgment requires a recipient to communicate with the source, 
sending back an acknowledgment message when it receives data. The sender keeps a 
record of each data packet (TCP segment) that it sends and expects an acknowledgment. 
1102.book  Page 484  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Windowing
485
The sender also starts a timer when it sends a segment, and it retransmits a segment if 
the timer expires before an acknowledgment arrives.
Figure 9-7 shows the sender transmitting data packets 1, 2, and 3. The receiver acknowl-
edges receipt of the packets by requesting packet 4. Upon receiving the acknowledgment, 
the sender sends packets 4, 5, and 6. If packet 5 does not arrive at the destination, the 
receiver acknowledges with a request to resend packet 5. The sender resends packet 5 
and then receives an acknowledgment to continue with the transmission of packet 7.
Figure 9-7 Window Size of 3
TCP provides sequencing of segments with a forward reference acknowledgment. Each 
datagram is numbered before transmission, as shown in Figure 9-8. At the receiving 
station, TCP reassembles the segments into a complete message. TCP must recover from 
data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order by the Internet com-
munication system. This is achieved by assigning a sequence number to each octet 
transmitted and requiring a positive acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiving TCP. 
If the ACK is not received within a timeout interval, the data is retransmitted. At the 
receiver, the sequence numbers are used to correctly order segments that might be received 
out of order and to eliminate duplicates. Damage is handled by adding a checksum to 
each segment transmitted, checking it at the receiver, and discarding damaged segments.

TCP
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol 
that provides reliable full-duplex data transmission. TCP is part of the TCP/IP proto-
col stack. In a connection-oriented environment, a connection is established between 
both ends before transfer of information can begin. TCP is responsible for breaking 
messages into segments, reassembling them at the destination station, resending any-
thing that is not received, and reassembling messages from the segments. TCP supplies 
a virtual circuit between end-user applications.
These protocols use TCP: 
■File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
■Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
■Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
■Domain Name System (DNS)
Figure 9-9 shows the TCP segment format.

UDP
User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the segment format for which is shown in Figure 9-10, 
is the connectionless transport protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple 
protocol that exchanges datagrams without acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery. 
This simplicity is evident when comparing the UDP segment format with that of TCP. 
Error processing and retransmission must be handled by upper-layer protocols. For 
example, if a TFTP download gets interrupted for some reason, the human operator 
can just retry until it is successfully done.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
UDP uses no windowing or acknowledgments; therefore, application layer protocols 
provide reliability. UDP is designed for applications that do not need to put sequences 
of segments together.  
These protocols use UDP: 
■Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
■Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
■Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP)
■Domain Name System (DNS)
TCP and UDP Port Numbers
Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to pass information to the upper layers. The 
combination of an IP address and a port number is referred to as a socket. Port numbers 
are used to keep track of different conversations crossing the network at the same time. 
Application software developers agree to use well-known port numbers that are con-
trolled by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, any conver-
sation bound for the FTP application uses the standard port numbers 20 (for the data) 
and 21 (for control), as shown in Figure 9-11. Conversations that do not involve an 
application with a well-known port number are assigned port numbers randomly from 
within a speciﬁc range above 1023. Some ports are reserved in both TCP and UDP, but 
applications might not be written to support them, as shown in Table 9-1. Port num-
bers have the assigned ranges shown in this table.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
As shown in Figure 9-12, end systems use port numbers to select the proper application. 
Originating source port numbers are assigned dynamically by the source host, with 
some number greater than 1023. As an example, a host attempting to connect to 
another using FTP sends a packet with a destination TCP port number of 21 (FTP) and 
a dynamically generated source port number such as 1028. This pair of port numbers 
(destination and source) deﬁnes the unique “conversation” between these hosts. If 
the same host initiates another FTP session to a second host, the destination port still 
is 21, but the source port generated is different (for example, 1030), to keep the two 
sessions separate.

TCP/IP Application Layer
491
TCP/IP Application Layer
The last layer of both the OSI and the TCP/IP model is referred to as the application 
layer. The application layer is the closest to the end user when interacting with soft-
ware applications such as sending and receiving e-mail over a network. You see how 
the application layer deals with data packets from client/server applications, domain 
name services, and network applications by examining the following elements:
■Client/server
■Redirectors
■Domain Name System
■E-mail
■Telnet
■FTP
■HTTP
Introduction to the Application Layer
In the context of the OSI reference model, the application layer (Layer 7) supports the 
communicating component of an application, as shown in Figure 9-13. The applica-
tion layer is responsible for the following:
■Identifying and establishing the availability of intended communication partners
■Synchronizing cooperating applications
■Establishing agreement on procedures for error recovery
■Controlling data integrity

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
The application layer is the layer closest to the end user. This determines whether sufﬁ-
cient resources exist for communication between systems. Without the application layer, 
there would be no network communication support. The application layer does not 
provide services to any other layer, but it does provide services to application processes 
lying outside the scope of the TCP/IP model, such as spreadsheet programs, word 
processing programs, and banking terminal programs. Additionally, the application 
layer provides a direct interface to the rest of the model for network applications (such 
as browser or e-mail program) or an indirect interface for standalone applications 
(such as word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation managers) with a network 
redirector.
Direct Network Applications
Most applications that work in a networked environment are classiﬁed as client/server 
applications. These applications, such as FTP clients (not protocols), web browsers, 
and e-mail programs, all have two components that allow them to function—the client 
side and the server side. The client side is located on the local computer and is the 
requestor of the services. The server side is located on a remote computer and provides 
services in response to the client’s requests.
A client/server application works by constantly repeating the following looped routine: 
client request, server response; client request, server response. For example, a web 
browser accesses a web page by requesting a uniform resource locator (URL), which is 
resolved to an IP address on a remote web server. After it locates the URL, the web 
server that is identiﬁed by that URL responds to the request. Then, based on the infor-
mation received from the web server, the client can request more information from the 
same web server or can access another web page from a different web server.
Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer are probably the most commonly used net-
work applications. An easy way to understand a web browser is to compare it to a 
television remote control. A remote control gives you the capability to directly control 
a TV’s functions: volume, channels, brightness, and so on. For the remote control to 
function properly, you do not need to understand how the remote control functions 
electronically. The same is true of a web browser; the browser gives you the capability 
to navigate through the web by clicking hyperlinks. For the web browser to function 
properly, it is not necessary for you to understand how the lower-layer OSI protocols 
work and interact.
Indirect Network Support
Within a LAN environment, indirect-application network support is also a client/server 
function. If a client wants to save a ﬁle from a word processor to a network server, the 
1102.book  Page 492  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

TCP/IP Application Layer
493
redirector enables the word-processing application to do so transparently. Remember 
that this transparency is supplied by the session layer Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
functionality.
A redirector is an OSI model session layer function that works with computer operat-
ing systems and network clients instead of speciﬁc application programs.
Examples of protocols that use redirectors are as follows:
■AppleTalk Filing Protocol
■NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI)
■Novell IPX/SPX protocols
■Network File System (NFS) of the TCP/IP protocol suite
A redirector enables a network administrator to assign remote resources to logical names 
on the local client. When you select one of these logical names to perform an operation 
such as saving a ﬁle or printing a ﬁle, the network redirector sends the selected ﬁle to 
the proper remote resource on the network for processing. If the resource is on a local 
computer, the redirector ignores the request and allows the local operating system to 
process the request.
The advantage of using a network redirector on a local client is that the applications 
on the client never have to recognize the network. In addition, the application that 
requests service is located on the local computer, and the redirector reroutes the request 
to the proper network resource, while the application treats it as a local request.
Redirectors expand the capabilities of non-network software. They also enable users 
to share documents, templates, databases, printers, and many other resource types 
without having to use special application software.
Networking has had a great inﬂuence on the development of programs such as word 
processors, spreadsheets, presentation managers, database programs, graphics, and 
productivity software. Many of these software packages are now network-integrated 
or network-aware; they have the capabilities of launching integrated web browsers or 
Internet tools and publishing their output to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
for easy web integration.
Making and Breaking a Connection
It is important to note that in each of the examples mentioned in the preceding sections, 
the connection to the server was maintained only long enough to complete a single 
task. In the web example, the connection was maintained just long enough to download 
the current web page. In the printer example, the connection was maintained just long 
1102.book  Page 493  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

494
Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
enough to send the document to the print server. After the processing was completed, 
the connection was broken and had to be re-established for the next processing request 
to take place. This is one of the two ways that communication sessions take place.
Later in this chapter, you learn about the second method in which communication ses-
sions take place. This is illustrated by the Telnet and FTP examples, in which a connec-
tion to the server is established and maintained until all processing has been performed. 
The client computer terminates the connection when the user determines that he or she 
has ﬁnished. All communication activity falls into one of these two categories. In the 
next section, you learn about the Domain Name System (DNS), which is supported by 
the application layer processes.
DNS
The Internet is built on a hierarchical addressing scheme. This allows for routing that 
is based on classes of addresses, as opposed to individual addresses. The problem that 
this creates for the user is associating the correct address with the Internet site. The 
only difference between the addresses 198.151.11.12 and 198.151.11.21 is one trans-
posed digit. It is very easy to forget an address to a particular site because there is 
nothing to associate the contents of the site with its address.
To associate the contents of the site with its address, a domain-naming system was devel-
oped. DNS is a system used on the Internet for translating names of domains and their 
publicly advertised network nodes into IP addresses. A domain is a group of computers 
that are associated by their geographical location or their business type. A domain 
name is a string of characters and/or numbers, usually a name or abbreviation that 
represents the numeric address of an Internet site. More than 200 top-level domains 
exist on the Internet; examples include the following: 
■.us—United States 
■.uk—United Kingdom 
There are also generic names, examples of which include the following:
■.edu—Educational sites 
■.com—Commercial sites 
■.gov—Government sites 
■.org—Nonproﬁt sites 
■.net—Network service 
■.mil—U.S. military sites
■.int—International database/treaty organization sites

site (www.iana.org/

495
The Domain Name Server
The Domain Name System (DNS) server is a device on a network that responds to 
requests from clients to translate a domain name into the associated IP address. The 
DNS system is set up in a hierarchy that creates different levels of DNS servers.
If a local DNS server is capable of translating a domain name into its associated IP 
address, it does so and returns the result to the client. If it cannot translate the address, 
it passes the request up to the next higher-level DNS server on the system, which then 
tries to translate the address. If the DNS server at this level is capable of translating the 
domain name into an associated IP address, it does so and returns the result to the 
client. If not, it sends the request to the next higher level. This process repeats itself 
until the domain name has been translated or until the top-level DNS server has been 
reached. If the domain name cannot be found on the top-level DNS server, it is con-
sidered to be an error and the corresponding error message is returned. Any type of 
application that uses domain names to represent IP addresses uses the DNS server to 
translate that name into its corresponding IP address.
FTP and TFTP
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is designed to download ﬁles (received or gotten from 
the Internet) and upload ﬁles (sent or put to the Internet). The capability to upload and 
download ﬁles is one of the most valuable features of the Internet. This is especially 
helpful for people who rely on computers for many purposes and who might need 
software drivers and upgrades immediately. Network administrators rarely can wait 
even a few days to get the necessary drivers that enable their network servers to function 
again. The Internet can provide these ﬁles immediately by using FTP. Like e-mail and 
Telnet, FTP is a client/server application. It requires server software running on a host 
that can be accessed by client software.
An FTP session is established the same way in which a Telnet session is established. 
Just like Telnet, the FTP session is maintained until the client terminates it or until 
there is some sort of communication error. When you establish a connection to an FTP 
process or daemon, you must supply a login ID and a password. Normally, you use 
Anonymous as the login ID and your e-mail address as the password. This type of con-
nection is known as anonymous FTP. After your identity is established, a command 
link opens between your client machine and the FTP server. This is similar to a Telnet 
session, in which commands are sent and executed on the server and the results are 
returned to the client. This feature enables you to create and change folders, erase and 
rename ﬁles, and execute many other functions associated with ﬁle management.
1102.book  Page 495  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

496
Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
The main purpose of FTP is to transfer ﬁles from one computer to another by copying 
and moving ﬁles from servers to clients and from clients to servers. When you copy 
ﬁles from a server, FTP establishes a second connection, a data link between the com-
puters, across which the data is transferred. Data transfer can occur in American Stan-
dard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) mode or binary mode. These two modes 
determine how the data ﬁle is to be transferred between the stations. ASCII format 
returns a human-readable representation of the number in seven ASCII characters. The 
ﬁrst character is a space or a negation sign, followed by three digits, a decimal point, 
and two more digits. If a number has less than three digits to the left of the decimal 
point, then the optional sign and digits are right-justiﬁed in the seven character ﬁeld, 
and spaces are ﬁlled in on the left. Because binary-mode numbers take only 4 bytes 
each, compared to the 7 of an ASCII representation, the binary representation takes 
less time to send over the serial link to the computer. However, there are marked 
advantages to using the ASCII representation. After the ﬁle transfer has ended, the 
data connection terminates automatically. After you complete the entire session of 
copying and moving ﬁles, you might log off, thus closing the command link and end-
ing the session.
The Trivial File Transport Protocol (TFTP) is a connectionless service that uses UDP. 
TFTP is used on routers and switches to transfer conﬁguration ﬁles and Cisco IOS 
Software images, and to transfer ﬁles between systems that support TFTP. It is designed 
to be small and easy to implement. Therefore, it lacks most of the features of regular 
FTP. The only thing it can do is read and write ﬁles (or mail) from or to a remote server. 
It cannot list directories, and currently it has no provisions for user authentication. It is 
useful in some LANs because it operates faster than FTP in a stable environment.
Another protocol that has the capability to download ﬁles is Hypertext Transfer Pro-
tocol (HTTP), as discussed in the next section. One limitation of HTTP is that you can 
use it only to download ﬁles, not upload them.
HTTP
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) works with the World Wide Web, which is 
the fastest-growing and most used part of the Internet. One of the main reasons for the 
extraordinary growth of the web is the ease in which it allows access to information. A 
web browser is a client/server application, which means that it requires both a client 
and a server component to function. A web browser presents data in multimedia formats 
on web pages that use text, graphics, sound, and video. The web pages are created 
with a format language called the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML directs 
a web browser on a particular web page to produce the appearance of the page in a 
speciﬁc manner. In addition, HTML speciﬁes locations for the placement of text, ﬁles, 
and objects that are to be transferred from the web server to the web browser. 
1102.book  Page 496  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

TCP/IP Application Layer
497
Hyperlinks make the World Wide Web easy to navigate. A hyperlink is an object (word, 
phrase, or picture) on a web page that, when clicked, transfers you to a new web page. 
The web page contains (often hidden within its HTML description) an address location 
known as a uniform resource locator (URL). 
Table 9-2 shows the components of a standard URL address (http://www.cisco.com/edu/ 
in this case).
When you open a web browser, the ﬁrst thing you usually see is a starting (or “home”) 
page. The URL of the home page already has been stored in the conﬁguration area of 
your web browser and can be changed at any time. From the starting page, you can 
click one of the web page hyperlinks or type a URL in the browser’s address bar. The 
web browser then examines the protocol to determine whether it needs to open another 
program, and it determines the IP address of the web server. After that, the transport 
layer, network layer, data link layer, and physical layer initiate a session with the web 
server. The data that is transferred to the HTTP server contains the folder name of 
the web page location (the data also can contain a speciﬁc ﬁlename for an HTML 
page). If no name is given, the server uses a default name (as speciﬁed in the server’s 
conﬁguration).
The server responds to the request by sending all of the text, audio, video, and graphic 
ﬁles, as speciﬁed in the HTML instructions, to the web client. The client browser reas-
sembles all the ﬁles to create a view of the web page and then terminates the session. If 
you click another page that is located on the same server or a different server, the whole 
process begins again.
SMTP
E-mail servers communicate with each other using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP) to send and receive mail. The SMTP protocol transports e-mail messages in 
ASCII format using TCP. You can connect to an SMTP server by performing a ping 
test to the SMTP port (25). This is a good way to test if a mail server is reachable.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
When a mail server receives a message destined for a local client, it stores that message 
and waits for the client to collect the mail. Mail clients can collect their mail in several 
ways: They can use programs that access the mail server ﬁles directly or can use one 
of many network protocols. The most popular mail client protocols are Post Ofﬁce 
Protocol Version 3 (POP3) and Internet Messaging Access Protocol Version 4 (IMAP4), 
which both use TCP to transport data. Even though mail clients use these special pro-
tocols to collect mail, they almost always use SMTP to send mail. Because two different 
protocols, and possibly two different servers, are used to send and receive mail, it is 
possible that mail clients can perform one task and not the other. Therefore, you should 
troubleshoot the sending of mail and the receiving of mail separately.
When verifying the conﬁguration of a mail client, both the mail relay server (SMTP) 
and mail servers (POP or IMAP) should be veriﬁed. SMTP does not offer much in 
the way of security and does not require any authentication. To prevent unauthorized 
users from bouncing mail messages off their servers, administrators often don’t allow 
hosts that are not part of their network to use their SMTP server to send (or relay) 
mail.
SNMP
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application layer protocol 
that facilitates the exchange of management information between network devices. 
SNMP enables network administrators to manage network performance, ﬁnd and 
solve network problems, and plan for network growth.
An SNMP-managed network consists of the following three key components: 
■Managed device—A network node that contains an SNMP agent and that resides 
on a managed network. Managed devices collect and store management informa-
tion and make this information available to NMSs using SNMP. Managed 
devices, sometimes called network elements, can be routers and access servers, 
switches and bridges, hubs, computer hosts, or printers.
■Agent—A network-management software module that resides in a managed device. 
An agent has local knowledge of management information and translates that 
information into a form compatible with SNMP.
■Network-management system (NMS)—Executes applications that monitor and 
control managed devices. NMSs provide the bulk of the processing and memory 
resources required for network management. One or more NMSs must exist on 
any managed network.

TCP/IP Application Layer

Telnet
Terminal emulation (Telnet) software provides the capability to remotely access another 
computer. It enables you to log in to an Internet host and execute commands. Telnet 
commonly is used for remote administration of servers and network equipment such as 
routers and switches. A Telnet client is referred to as a local host, and a Telnet server, 
which uses special software called a daemon, is referred to as a remote host, as shown 
in Figure 9-14.
Figure 9-14 Telnet
To make a connection from a Telnet client, you must select a connection option. The 
host name and terminal type will need to be entered on the command-line prompt. 
The host name is the IP address (DNS) of the remote computer to which you connect. 
The terminal type describes the type of terminal emulation that you want the computer 
to perform. The Telnet operation uses none of the transmitting computer’s processing 
power. Instead, it transmits the keystrokes to the remote host and sends the resulting 
screen output back to the local monitor. All processing and storage takes place on the 
remote computer. 
When a DNS name for a Telnet location is entered, the name must be translated into 
its associated IP address before a connection can be established. The Telnet application 
works mainly at the top three layers of the OSI model—the application layer (commands), 
the presentation layer (formats, usually ASCII), and the session layer (transmits). The data 
then passes to the transport layer, where it is segmented, and the port address and error 
checking are added. The data then passes to the network layer, where the IP header 
(containing the source and destination IP addresses) is added. Next, the packet travels 
to the data link layer, which encapsulates the packet in a data frame, adds the source 
and destination MAC address, and adds a frame trailer. If the source computer doesn’t 
have the MAC address of the destination computer, it performs an ARP request. When 
the MAC address has been determined, the frame travels across the physical medium 
(in binary form) to the next device. Telnet is a good network troubleshooting tool 
because it tests all seven layers of the OSI model and allows remote diagnostics to be 
performed.

Chapter 9: TCP/IP Transport and Application Layer
When the data reaches the remote host computer, the data link layer, the network layer, 
and the transport layer reassemble the original data commands. The remote host com-
puter executes the commands and transmits the results back to the local client computer 
by using the same process of encapsulation that delivered the original commands. This 
whole process repeats itself, sending commands and receiving results until the local 
client has completed the work that needs to be done. When the work is done, the client 
terminates the session.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the functions of the TCP/IP application layer and 
transport layer. You also learned about the different processes that occur as data pack-
ets travel through this layer. More speciﬁcally, you learned that the application layer is 
responsible for these actions:
■Identiﬁes and establishes the availability of intended communication partners
■Synchronizes cooperating applications
■Establishes agreement on procedures for error recovery
■Controls data integrity
In addition, you learned that the application layer supports the following:
■Direct and indirect network applications
■The Domain Name System
■Telnet, FTP, and HTTP
■TCP, UDP, SMTP, and SNMP
To supplement all that you’ve learned in this chapter, refer to the chapter-speciﬁc Videos, 
PhotoZooms, and e-Lab Activities on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.

Key Terms
501
Key Terms
acknowledgment
Notiﬁcation sent from one network device to another to acknowledge 
that some event (for example, receipt of a message) occurred. Sometimes abbreviated 
ACK.
application
A program that performs a function directly for a user. FTP and Telnet 
clients are examples of network applications.
application layer
Layer 7 of the OSI reference model. This layer provides services 
to application processes (such as e-mail, ﬁle transfer, and terminal emulation) that are 
outside the OSI reference model. The application layer identiﬁes and establishes the 
availability of intended communication partners (and the resources required to con-
nect with them), synchronizes cooperating applications, and establishes agreement 
on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity. 
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
An 8-bit code (7 bits 
plus parity) for character representation.
DNS (Domain Name System)
The system used in the Internet for translating names 
of network nodes into addresses.
ﬂow control 
A technique for ensuring that a transmitting entity does not overwhelm 
a receiving entity with data. When the buffers on the receiving device are full, a mes-
sage is sent to the sending device to suspend the transmission until the data in the buffers 
has been processed. In IBM networks, this technique is called pacing.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
An application protocol, part of the TCP/IP protocol 
stack, used for transferring ﬁles between network nodes. FTP is deﬁned in RFC 959.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
A simple hypertext document formatting lan-
guage that uses tags to indicate how a given part of a document should be interpreted 
by a viewing application, such as a web browser.
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
The protocol used by web browsers and web 
servers to transfer ﬁles, such as text and graphics ﬁles.
port
In IP terminology, an upper-layer process that receives information from lower 
layers. Ports are numbered, and many are associated with a speciﬁc process. For exam-
ple, SMTP is associated with port 25. A port number of this type is called a well-known 
port or address. 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
A connection-oriented transport-layer protocol 
that provides reliable full-duplex data transmission. TCP is part of the TCP/IP proto-
col stack.

Telnet
A standard terminal emulation protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Telnet 
is used for remote terminal connection, enabling users to log in to remote systems and 
use resources as if they were connected to a local system. Telnet is deﬁned in RFC 854.
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
A simpliﬁed version of FTP that allows ﬁles to 
be transferred from one computer to another over a network.
three-way handshake
A sequence of messages exchanged between two or more net-
work devices to ensure transmission synchronization before sending user data.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
A connectionless transport layer protocol in the 
TCP/IP protocol stack. UDP is a simple protocol that exchanges datagrams without 
acknowledgments or guaranteed delivery, requiring that error processing and retrans-
mission be handled by other protocols. UDP is deﬁned in RFC 768.
windowing
A ﬂow-control mechanism requiring that the source device receive an 
acknowledgment from the destination after transmitting a certain amount of data.

WANs and Routers
In this chapter, you learn about WAN devices, technologies, and standards. In addition, 
you learn about the function of a router in a WAN.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that you will ﬁnd 
on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed to supple-
ment the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
WAN Characteristics
A wide-area network (WAN) is a data communications network that extends across a 
large geographic area. WANs often use transmission facilities provided by common carriers, 
for example, telephone companies.
A WAN differs from a local-area network (LAN) in several ways. For example, unlike a 
LAN, which connects workstations, peripherals, terminals, and other devices in a single 
building or other small geographic area, a WAN makes data connections across a broad 
geographic area. Companies use a WAN to connect various company sites so that infor-
mation can be exchanged between distant ofﬁces.
A WAN operates at the physical layer (Layer 1) and the data link layer (Layer 2) of the 
OSI reference model. It interconnects LANs that are usually separated by large geographic 
areas. WANs provide for the exchange of data packets/frames between routers/switches
and the LANs they support.
Table 10-1 lists some CPU information indicative of speciﬁc examples of data networks.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
As shown in Figure 10-1, the major characteristics of WANs are as follows:
 
■They connect devices that are separated by wide geographical areas.
 
■They use the services of carriers such as the regional Bell operating companies 
(RBOCs), Sprint, and MCI.
 
■They use serial connections of various types to access bandwidth over large 
geographic areas.
 
■They connect devices that are separated by wide geographical areas.

Component Uptime
Each physical component of the WAN can be monitored and measured for its availability using 
uptime. Uptime is the opposite of downtime: It is the amount of time that the device is func-
tional and in service relative to the users’ requirements for its availability. It is common for 
uptime to be statistically overstated by measuring it on a 7-day-24-hour basis, even though the 
users' requirements might be for only 5 days-a-week 12 hours a day. Remember to tailor this 
metric and every other metric as closely as possible to your users’ stated requirements for net-
work performance.
Although electronic devices are highly reliable, they eventually fail. Most manufacturers pro-
vide a mean time between failure (MTBF) rating for their equipment as a reassurance of how 
reliable their products really are. Typically, MTBF ratings are in the tens of thousands of hours. 
These hours could conceivably translate into years of trouble-free service. Unfortunately, these 
ratings are statistically derived. The actual time between failures of any given device depends 
greatly on a number of factors, including the following:
 
■Ambient temperature ranges of the operating environment
 
■Cleanliness of the commercial electric power
 
■Quality of the handling of the devices before and during operation
Monitoring and tracking uptime of individual components enables you to demonstrate to your 
user community how well you are satisfying their requirements for the network’s availability. 
Component uptime data can also be charted over time to identify potentially problematic com-
ponents in your network infrastructure. Such trends can provide information about the general 
reliability of a given type or brand of hardware, which then can be used to identify individual 
components that might be at risk of failure.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
More Information: WAN Performance Criteria (Continued)
Note that the term availability is sometimes used to generically describe aggregate network 
uptime. Unfortunately, it is not a good metric. In theory, network availability provides a quanti-
ﬁed synopsis of the network’s readiness. In practice, availability is so nebulous that it is virtu-
ally meaningless.
To illustrate this point, if a router at a premise location fails, the entire network is unavailable to 
the users at that location. The network, however, is available to users at every other location. 
They will not be able to access hosts at the affected location, but they will also not be impeded 
from accessing every other host in the network. The extent to which the network is available 
varies greatly by location and by usage requirements. Therefore, quantifying network availabil-
ity can be more onerous than it is valuable.
Trafﬁc Volumes
One of the more important metrics for any WAN is the volume of trafﬁc that it is expected to 
support. Volume is almost always volatile; it varies with time, business cycles, seasons, and so 
on. In other words, you can count on trafﬁc volumes being anything but constant. Given this 
volatility, it is important to measure volumes in two different ways, maximum volumes and 
average volumes:
 
■The maximum volume that you expect the network to support is known as the peak
volume. As its name implies, this peak volume is the greatest amount of trafﬁc that 
you expect the network to have to support.
 
■Average volumes are the trafﬁc loads that you can reasonably expect during the course of 
a business day from any given work location.
Establishing these two trafﬁc volumes is critical to sizing the WAN’s transmission facilities, as 
well as the facilities of its routers. If you expect any given location to generate a trafﬁc load of 
100 kbps during the course of a business day, for example, a 56-kbps transmission facility is 
clearly inadequate.
Delay
Delay is one of the more common metrics that can be used to measure network performance. 
Delay is the time that elapses between two events. In data communications, these two events 
are typically the transmission and reception of data. Therefore, delay is the total amount of 
time that is required by the network to transport a packet from its point of origin to its destina-
tion. Given this deﬁnition, delay is an aggregate phenomenon with many potential causes. 
Three of the more common types of delay are the following:
 
■Propagation delay—Propagation delay is the cumulative amount of time required to trans-
mit, or propagate, the data across an end-to-end transmission path. The network infra-
structure within each transmission facility in the network path directly contributes to the 
aggregate forwarding delay of any given transmission. An additional factor in propagation 
delay is trafﬁc volume. The more trafﬁc that is ﬂowing across a given facility, the less 
bandwidth that is available for new transmissions. Propagation delay is inherent in terres-
trial circuits, regardless of whether they traverse glass or copper media or are transmitted 
through the air using microwave radio frequencies.

WAN Devices
The following devices are used in WANs, as represented in Figure 10-2:
 
■Routers—Offer many services, including internetworking and WAN interface ports.
 
■Switches—Connect to WAN bandwidth for voice, data, and video communication.
 
■Modems—Include interfaces to voice-grade services (analog dialup modems); 
channel service units/digital service units (CSU/DSUs) that interface T1/E1 ser-
vices; and terminal adapters/Network Termination 1s (TAs/NT1s) that interface 
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) services.
 
■Communication servers—Concentrate dial-in and dial-out user communication.
Figure 10-2 Common WAN Devices
WAN Standards
WAN data-link protocols describe how frames are carried between systems on a single 
data link. They include protocols designed to operate over dedicated point-to-point, 
multipoint, and multiaccess switched services, such as Frame Relay. WAN standards 
are deﬁned and managed by a number of recognized authorities, including the follow-
ing agencies:
 
■International Telecommunication Union-Telecommunication Standardization 
Sector (ITU-T), formerly the Consultative Committee for International Tele-
graph and Telephone (CCITT)
More Information: WAN Performance Criteria (Continued)
 
■Satellite uplink/downlink delays—Some transmission facilities are satellite-based, requir-
ing the signal to be transmitted up to the satellite and then transmitted back down from 
the satellite. Because of the great distances between the terrestrial transmission facilities 
and the satellite, these delays can be quite noticeable.
 
■Forwarding delay—Forwarding delay in a network is the amount of time that a physical 
device needs to receive, buffer, process, and forward data. The actual forwarding delay of 
any given device can vary over time. Individual devices operating at or near capacity will 
likely experience a greater forwarding delay than comparable devices that are less utilized. 
Additionally, forwarding delay can be exacerbated by heavy trafﬁc or error conditions in 
the network. Forwarding delay can be described as latency within individual components.

The WAN physical layer describes the interface between the data terminal equipment 
(DTE) and the data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE). Typically, a DCE device 
is service provider equipment that provides clocking and switching services within a 
network, and a DTE device is an attached customer device. In this model, the services 
offered to the DTE are made available through a modem or a CSU/DSU (see Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-3 WAN Services
To ensure that the correct protocol is used, you must conﬁgure the appropriate Layer 2 
encapsulation on the router. The choice of the protocol depends on the WAN technol-
ogy and communicating equipment being utilized.
WAN physical layer protocols describe how to provide electrical, mechanical, opera-
tional, and functional connections for WAN services. These services are usually 
obtained from WAN service providers, such as RBOCs; alternate carriers; and Post, 
Telephone, and Telegraph (PTT) agencies.
The following physical layer standards are speciﬁed:
 
■EIA/TIA-232—Common physical layer interface standard that supports unbal-
anced circuits at signal speeds of up to 64 kbps. Closely resembles the V.24 
speciﬁcation.
 
■EIA/TIA-449—A faster (up to 2 Mbps) version of EIA/TIA-232 capable of 
longer cable runs.
 
■V.24—Physical layer interface between DTE and DCE. V.24 is essentially the 
same as the EIA/TIA-232.
 
■V.35—A synchronous, physical layer protocol for communications between a 
network access device and a packet network. V.35 is most commonly used in the 
United States and in Europe and is recommended for speeds up to 48 kbps.

High-Level Data Link 
Control (HDLC)
An IEEE standard.
Is the default encapsulation on point-to-point dedicated 
links, and circuit-switch connections.
Cisco HDLC is a proprietary version, bit-oriented, syn-
chronous data link layer protocol typically used when 
communicating between two Cisco devices.
Cisco HDLC might be incompatible with other ven-
dors’ versions due to the method of implementation 
those vendors have chosen.
Supports both point-to-point and multipoint conﬁgura-
tions with minimal overhead.
Frame Relay
Uses high-quality digital facilities.
Uses simpliﬁed framing with no error correction mech-
anisms, which means it can send Layer 2 information 
much more rapidly than other WAN protocols.
Industry-standard switched data link layer protocol 
that handles multiple virtual circuits.
Next generation to X.25, Frame Relay is streamlined to 
eliminate some of the time-consuming processes that 
were employed in X.25, such as error correction and 
ﬂow control.

POTS and ISDN are dialup services, which means that when the call is made, an end-
to-end physical path is set up and the bandwidth is reserved end to end. Both POTS 
and ISDN use straight time-division multiplexing (TDM), which is sometimes referred 
to as synchronous transfer mode (STM).
Packet-Switched Services
Packet-switched services route small units of data called packets through a network 
based on the destination address contained within each packet. Figure 10-8 shows an 
example network topology that supports packet-switched services.

Table 10-4 describes the characteristics of two most common packet-switched 
services—X.25 and Frame Relay.
X.25 is both connection-oriented and reliable at both Layers 2 and 3, which is a big 
part of why it is so much slower than Frame Relay.
Frame Relay is typically regarded as a much faster, sleeker version of X.25; it has no 
deﬁned Layer 3 protocol, nor is it reliable. However, it is connection-oriented. 
Circuit-switched services use time-division multiplexing (TDM) and are said to be syn-
chronous (they use STM), whereas packet-switched services use statistical TDM and 
are sometimes said to be asynchronous (similar to ATM).

T1, T3, E1, E3
The T series of services in the U.S. and the E series of services in 
Europe are extremely important WAN technologies.
They use TDM to slice up and assign time slots for data 
transmission.
Bandwidths for the T and E series lines are 1.544 Mbps for T1, 
44.736 Mbps for T3, 2.048 Mbps for E1, and 34.368 Mbps 
for E3. Other bandwidths are also available.
The media used are typically twisted-pair copper wire and opti-
cal ﬁber.
Usage is extremely widespread.
Cost is moderate.
xDSL
A new and developing family of WAN technologies intended 
primarily for home use.
xDSL indicates the entire family of DSL technologies, including 
high-bit-rate DSL (HDSL), single-line DSL (SDSL), asymmetric 
DSL (ADSL), and very-high-data-rate DSL (VDSL).
Bandwidth decreases with increasing distance from the phone 
company’s equipment.
Top speeds of 51.84 Mbps are possible near a phone company 
ofﬁce; however, most bandwidths are much lower from hun-
dreds of kbps to several Mbps.
Cost is moderate and decreasing.
SONET
A family of very high-speed physical layer technologies.
Designed for optical ﬁber, but can also run on copper cables.

Implemented at different Optical Carrier (OC) levels, ranging 
from 51.84 Mbps (OC-1) to 9,952 Mbps (OC-192).
Can achieve high data rates by using wavelength division multi-
plexing (WDM). WDM is when lasers are tuned to slightly 
different colors, or wavelengths, to send huge amounts of data 
optically.
Usage is widespread among Internet backbone entities.
The cost is expensive. This is not a technology that connects to 
homes.

More Information: Costs of the WAN
Tempering the various performance criteria of the WAN is cost. The costs of owning and oper-
ating a WAN include the initial startup costs, as well as the monthly recurring expenses. Not 
surprisingly, the larger and more powerful network components are much more expensive 
than smaller, less-robust components. Therefore, designing a WAN becomes an economic 
exercise in which a careful balance of performance and cost is achieved.
Achieving this balance can be painful. No one wants to design a WAN that disappoints the 
users with its performance, but no one wants to design a WAN that blows the budget, either! 
Fortunately, the following suggestions can help guide the design of a WAN that satisﬁes exist-
ing requirements, provides ﬂexibility for future growth, and doesn’t exceed the budget:
■The capital investments in routers and other network hardware become a ﬁxed part of the 
network. After the hardware components are placed in operation, the logistics of replacing 
hardware become quite complicated. And, depending on your depreciation schedule for 
capital equipment, you might ﬁnd yourself obligated to use the hardware for ﬁve or more 
years! It might behoove you to purchase a larger router that is relatively low in port den-
sity. You can add hardware (memory, CPUs, and interfaces) in the future as the need for 
them arises. This method allows future expansion at modest incremental costs and little (if 
any) operational downtime.
■The transmission facilities are relatively easy to replace with other transmission facilities. 
They are an expense item, not a capital investment, so there is no depreciation expense to 
retire. These can be replaced with other facilities as often as your lease agreement with 
the carrier permits. Therefore, you might want to explore your options for meeting perfor-
mance requirements with the various available transmission facilities and technologies.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
More Information: Resource Utilization Rates
The degree to which the various physical resources of the WAN are being utilized is also a good 
indicator of how well, or how poorly, the WAN is performing relative to the performance 
requirements. Two main categories of resource utilization rates should be monitored carefully:
■Router CPU and memory utilization rates
■Transmission facility utilization rates
Router Physical Resource Rates
Routers are one of the most vital components of any WAN. And, unlike the transmission facili-
ties, they are outside the view of the telecommunications carrier. Therefore, they are distinctly 
the responsibility of the customer. Fortunately, routers are intelligent devices that contain their 
own CPU and memory. These physical resources are indispensable in the calculation of WAN 
routes and the forwarding of packets. They can also be used to monitor the performance of the 
router.
If either CPU or memory utilization rates approach 100 percent, performance suffers. Numer-
ous conditions can result in either utilization rate temporarily spiking upward with subsequent 
performance degradation. One example is a sudden increase in transmissions from the LAN to 
the WAN. LANs can operate at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, but they usually operate only at 10, 16, 
or 100 Mbps. Any of these speeds is a gross mismatch against the typical WAN transmission 
facility, which offers a paltry 1.544 Mbps of bandwidth. This mismatch in bandwidth must be 
buffered by the router’s memory. It won’t take long for a router to become resource constricted 
given a sustained period of heavy LAN transmissions.
If such situations are rarely experienced, they should be considered aberrations. Aberrations 
should be monitored, but they shouldn’t drive physical upgrades. If these resource constrictions 
recur or constitute a trend, however, something needs to be done. Usually this requires an 
upgrade, either to the next larger router or via an expansion of memory. If a router is chronically 
at or near 100 percent of capacity with its memory, it is time to purchase additional memory.
However, responding to chronically high CPU utilization rates might not be as simple as a 
memory upgrade. Really, only three options exist for improving high CPU utilization rates:
■If possible, add another CPU to the router.
■Upgrade to a more powerful router.
■Investigate the WAN’s trafﬁc patterns to see if the load on the problematic router can be 
reduced.
Manipulating trafﬁc patterns is really only a viable option in larger WANs with complex topolo-
gies that can afford route redundancy.
Transmission Facility Rates
Transmission facilities can also be monitored for utilization. Typically, this utilization rate is 
expressed in terms of the percentage of consumed bandwidth. If you are using a T1, for exam-
ple, a given sample might indicate that 30 percent of its 1.544 Mbps of available bandwidth is 
currently being utilized.

WAN Routers
529
WAN Routers
Just as computers need operating systems to run software applications, routers need 
Cisco IOS Software to run conﬁguration ﬁles. These conﬁguration ﬁles contain the 
instructions and parameters that control the ﬂow of trafﬁc in and out of the routers. 
Speciﬁcally, by using routing protocols to direct routed protocols and routing tables, 
routers make decisions regarding the best path for packets. The conﬁguration ﬁle spec-
iﬁes all the information the router needs to make these decisions.
Router Internal Components
Table 10-9 outlines the main internal conﬁguration components of the router.
More Information: Resource Utilization Rates (Continued)
These rates can be tricky to analyze and might even be misleading. It is not uncommon, for 
example, for network-management software packages to capture utilization data in time inter-
vals. These intervals can be 1 hour, 5 minutes, or just about any other interval. If set too 
coarsely, the sampling frequency can miss short-duration ﬂuctuations in bandwidth consump-
tion. If the sampling is too frequent, you can ﬁnd yourself mired in a meaningless morass of 
data points. The trick is ﬁnding the right frequency that provides meaningful data about how 
the network is performing relative to the users’ expectations.
Beyond merely selecting the sampling rate is the issue of sampling window. The sampling 
window should be determined by the users’ requirements for WAN availability. If the utilization 
samples are spread over a 24-hour day and a 7-day week, whereas the users work only 
10 hours per day, 5 days per week, the statistical data is not indicative of how well the users’ 
requirements are being met.
Utilization rates are a wonderful statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the status of 
transmission facilities. However, they are not the only metric for assessing a network’s perfor-
mance. The network is successful only if it satisﬁes the users’ requirements. Therefore, a com-
bination of performance metrics that provides a multifaceted, composite perspective is likely to 
provide a better assessment of the network’s success than any single metric can offer.

WAN Routers
531
More Information: A Closer Look at Routers
Routers are designed to interconnect multiple networks. This interconnection enables machines 
on different networks to communicate with each other. Interconnected networks can be 
co-located or geographically dispersed. Networks that are geographically dispersed are usually 
interconnected via a WAN. WANs are constructed of numerous different technologies, includ-
ing routers, transmission facilities, and line drivers. It is the router’s capability to interconnect 
networks in a WAN that has made it indispensable.
A router is an intelligent network device that operates predominantly at the ﬁrst three layers of 
the OSI reference model. Routers, like any host, are actually capable of operating at all seven 
layers of the OSI reference model. Depending on your particular conﬁguration, you might or 
might not use all seven layers of functionality. However, the need for the ﬁrst three layers is 
virtually universal. Communication across the ﬁrst two layers allows routers to communicate 
directly with LANs (data link layer constructs). More importantly, routers can identify routes 
through networks based on Layer 3 addresses. This enables routers to internetwork multiple 
networks by using network layer addressing, regardless of how near or far they might be rela-
tive to each other.
Understanding routers and routing requires examining a router from two different perspec-
tives: physical and logical. From a physical perspective, routers contain myriad parts, each of 
which has a speciﬁc function. From a logical perspective, routers perform many functions, 
including ﬁnding other routers in the network, learning about potential destination networks 
and hosts, discovering and tracking potential routes, and forwarding datagrams toward their 
speciﬁed destination. Together, these physical components and logical functions enable you to 
build and use internetworks, including WANs.
Physical Components of a Router
A router is a remarkably complex device. Its complexity lies in its routing engine logic that 
enables the physical device to perform the various routing functions. The complexity of routing 
logic is hidden by the relative simplicity of the router’s physical form. The most common type 
of router is actually a highly specialized type of computer; it contains the same basic compo-
nents as any other computer. These components include the following:
■A central processing unit (CPU)
■Random-access memory (RAM)
■A basic input/output system (BIOS)
■An operating system (OS)
■A motherboard
■Physical input/output (I/O) ports
■A power supply, chassis, and sheet-metal skin

532
Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
More Information: A Closer Look at Routers (Continued)
The vast majority of a router’s components will remain forever shielded from the eyes of net-
work administrators by the chassis’ sheet-metal skin. These components are extremely reliable 
and, under normal operating conditions, shouldn’t see the light of day. The obvious exceptions 
to this general statement are born of expansion. Any time you need to add more resources to 
the router, you might have to take off its cover. Such resources usually include either memory 
or I/O ports.
The components that a network administrator will encounter most often are the OS and the I/O 
ports. A router’s OS (in Cisco Systems’ case, the Internetwork Operating System or IOS) is the 
software that controls the various hardware components and makes them usable. Network 
administrators mostly use a command-line interface to develop a logical conﬁguration. The 
conﬁguration is a proﬁle of the system: the numbers, the locations, the types of each I/O port, 
and details such as addressing and bandwidth information. A router’s conﬁguration can also 
include security information such as which users are permitted access to speciﬁc I/O ports and 
conﬁguration modes.
The I/O ports are the one physical router component that network administrators see on a rou-
tine basis. These ports bear out the router’s unique capability to interconnect seemingly end-
less combinations of LAN and WAN transmission technologies. Each one of these ports, 
whether LAN or WAN, must have its own I/O port on the router. These ports function like a net-
work interface card (NIC) in a LAN-attached computer; they are related to the medium and 
framing mechanisms expected and provide the appropriate physical interfaces. Many of these 
physical interfaces appear quite similar to each other. This physical similarity belies the differ-
ences between the higher-layer functions of those technologies. Therefore, you will ﬁnd it more 
useful to examine transmission technologies than to examine speciﬁc physical interfaces.
Functions of a Router 
The logical functions that a router performs are just as important as providing physical inter-
connectivity for multiple networks. These functions make the physical interconnections usable. 
For example, internetworked communications require that at least one physical path intercon-
nect the source and destination machines. However, having and using a physical path are two 
very different things. Speciﬁcally, the source and destination machines must speak a common 
language (a routed protocol). It also helps if the routers that lie between them also speak a 
common language (a routing protocol) and agree on which speciﬁc physical path is the best 
one to use.
Therefore, some of the more salient functions that a router provides are
■Physical interconnectivity
■Logical interconnectivity
■Route calculation and maintenance
■Security

WAN Routers
533
More Information: A Closer Look at Routers (Continued)
Physical Interconnectivity
A router has a minimum of two (and frequently many more) physical I/O ports. I/O ports, or 
interfaces as they are better known, are used to physically connect network transmission facili-
ties to a router. Each port is connected to a circuit board that is attached to the router’s mother-
board. Thus, the motherboard actually provides the interconnectivity among multiple networks.
The network administrator must conﬁgure each interface via the router’s console. Conﬁgura-
tion includes deﬁning the interface’s port number in the router, the speciﬁc transmission tech-
nology and bandwidth available on the network connected to that interface, and the types of 
protocols that will be used through that interface. The actual parameters that must be deﬁned 
vary based on the type of network interface.
Note that on the higher-end platforms (7500 and 12000) the interfaces (VIP2 or line card) can 
forward packets without interrupting the main CPU.
Logical Interconnectivity
As soon as a router interface is conﬁgured, it can be activated. The interface’s conﬁguration 
identiﬁes the type of transmission facility that it connects to, the interface’s IP address, and the 
address of the network that it connects to. Upon activation of a port, the router immediately 
begins monitoring all the packets that are being transmitted on the network attached to the 
newly activated port. This monitoring allows it to “learn” about network and host IP addresses 
that reside on the networks that can be reached via that port. These addresses are stored in 
tables called routing tables. Routing tables correlate the port number of each interface in the 
router with the network layer addresses that can be reached (either directly or indirectly) via 
that port.
A router can also be conﬁgured with a default route. A default route associates a speciﬁc router 
interface with all unknown destination addresses. This association allows a router to forward a 
datagram to destinations that it has not yet learned of. Default routes can be useful in other 
ways, too. Default routes can be used to minimize the growth of routing tables, for example, or 
can be used to reduce the amount of trafﬁc generated between routers as they exchange rout-
ing information.
However, consider your default route carefully because it could potentially cause problems if 
not thoroughly thought out as for trafﬁc ﬂow.
Route Calculation and Maintenance
Routers communicate with each other using a predetermined protocol, a routing protocol. 
Routing protocols enable routers to do the following:
■Identify potential routes to speciﬁc destination networks
■Perform a mathematical calculation, based on the routing protocol’s algorithm, to deter-
mine the best path to each destination
■Continuously monitor the network to detect any topology changes that might render 
known routes invalid

More Information: A Closer Look at Routers (Continued)
Many different types of routing protocols exist. Some, such as the Routing Information Proto-
col (RIP), are quite simple. Others, such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), are remarkably 
powerful and feature-rich but complicated. In general, routing protocols can use two approaches 
to make routing decisions: distance vectors and link states. A distance-vector routing protocol 
makes its decisions based on some measurement of the distance between source and destination 
machines. A link-state protocol bases its decisions on various states of the links, or transmis-
sion facilities, that interconnect the source and destination machines. Neither one is right or 
wrong; they are just different ways of making the same decisions. However, they result in 
different levels of performance, including convergence times.
You can evaluate routing protocols using numerous, more-speciﬁc criteria than just which 
approaches they use. Some of the more meaningful criteria include the following:
■Optimality—Optimality describes a routing protocol’s capability to select the best avail-
able route. Unfortunately, the word best is ambiguous. Many different ways exist to evalu-
ate different routes to any given destination. Each way could result in the selection of a 
different “best” route depending on the criteria used. The criteria used by routing proto-
cols to calculate and evaluate routes are known as routing metrics. A wide variety of met-
rics are used, and they vary widely by routing protocol. One simple metric is hop count,
the number of hops, or routers, that lie between the source and destination machines.
■Efﬁciency—Another criterion to consider when evaluating routing protocols is their opera-
tional efﬁciency. Operational efﬁciency can be measured by examining the physical 
resources, including router RAM and CPU time, and network bandwidth required by a 
given routing protocol. You might need to consult your router manufacturer or vendor to 
determine the relative efﬁciencies of any protocols you are considering.
■Robustness—A routing protocol should perform reliably at all times, not just when the 
network is stable. Error conditions, including hardware or transmission-facility failures, 
router conﬁguration errors, and even heavy trafﬁc loads, adversely affect a network. 
Therefore, that a routing protocol functions properly during periods of network failure or 
instability is critical.
■Convergence—Because they are intelligent devices, routers can automatically detect 
changes in the internetwork. When a change is detected, all the routers involved must con-
verge on a new agreement of the network’s topology and recalculate the routes to known 
destinations accordingly. This process of reaching mutual agreement is called conver-
gence. Each routing protocol uses different mechanisms for detecting and communicating 
network changes. Therefore, each one converges at a different rate. In general, the slower 
a routing protocol converges, the greater the potential for disrupting service across the 
internetwork.
■Scalability—A network’s scalability is its capability to grow. Although growth isn’t a 
requirement in every organization, the routing protocol that you select should be capable 
of scaling upward to meet your network’s projected growth.

WAN Routers
535
Router External Connections
The three basic types of connections on a router are LAN interfaces, WAN interfaces, 
and management ports, as illustrated by Figure 10-10. LAN interfaces allow the router 
to connect to the LAN media, which is usually some form of Ethernet. However, it 
could be some other LAN technology such as Token Ring or ATM.
Figure 10-10 Router External Connections
WAN connections provide connections through a service provider to a distant site or 
to the Internet. These connections can be serial connections or any number of other 
WAN interfaces. With some types of WAN interfaces, an external device such as a 
CSU is required to connect the router to the service provider’s local connection. With 
other types of WAN connections, the router might be directly connected to the service 
provider.
The function of management ports is different from that of the other connections. The 
LAN and WAN connections provide network connections through which frame packets 
are passed.The management port provides a text-based connection for the conﬁgura-
tion and troubleshooting of the router. The common management interfaces are the 
console and auxilliary ports. These are EIA-232 asynchronous serial ports. They are 
connected to a communications port on a computer. The computer will run a terminal 
emulation program to provide a text-based session with the router. Through this ses-
sion the network administrator can manage the device.
Management Port Connections
The console port and the auxiliary (AUX) port are management ports. These asynchro-
nous serial ports are not designed as networking ports. One of these two ports is 
required for the initial conﬁguration of the router. The console port is recommended 
for this initial conﬁguration. Not all routers have an auxiliary port.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
When the router is ﬁrst put into service, no networking parameters are conﬁgured. 
Therefore, the router cannot communicate with any network. To prepare for initial star-
tup and conﬁguration, attach an RS-232 ASCII terminal, or a computer emulating an 
ASCII terminal, to the system console port. Then you can enter conﬁguration com-
mands to set up the router.
Once you enter this initial conﬁguration into the router through the console or auxil-
iary port, you can then connect the router to the network for troubleshooting or 
monitoring.
You can also conﬁgure the router from a remote location by dialing to a modem con-
nected to the console or auxiliary port on a router.
The console port is also preferred over the auxiliary port for troubleshooting. This 
preference for the console port is because it displays router startup, debugging, and 
error messages by default. You can use the console port when the networking services 
have not been started or have failed. Therefore, you can use the console port for disas-
ter and password recovery procedures.
The Function of a Router in a WAN
While you can use routers to segment LANs, the major use for a router is as a WAN 
device. Routers have both LAN and WAN interfaces. In fact, WAN technologies are 
frequently used to connect routers. These routers communicate with each other through 
WAN connections. Routers are the backbone devices of large intranets and of the 
Internet. They operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, making decisions based on net-
work addresses (on the Internet, by using IP).
The two main functions of a router are as follows:
■The selection of best paths for incoming data packets
■The switching of packets to the proper outgoing interface
Routers accomplish these functions by building routing tables and exchanging the net-
work information contained within them with other routers.
An administrator can maintain routing tables by conﬁguring static routes. However, 
routing tables are generally maintained dynamically through the use of a routing pro-
tocol that exchanges network topology, or path, information with other routers.
An example is when computer x needs to communicate with computer y and computer z. 
Both computer y and computer z are located in distant parts of the world. For com-
puter x to communicate with the other computers, a routing feature for information

ﬂow is required, as well as redundant paths for reliability. Many network design deci-
sions and technologies can be traced back to the need for computers x, y, and z to 
communicate, or internetwork.
Note, however, that an internetwork must also include the following:
■Consistent end-to-end addressing
■Addresses that represent network topologies
■Best path selection
■Dynamic routing and/or static routing
■Switching

More Information: Roles of the Router in WANs
More often than not, internetworks are extensive in terms of the number of routers, transmis-
sion facilities, and attached end systems. In an extensive internetwork, such as the Internet or 
even large private networks, it is virtually impossible for any given machine to know about 
every other machine. Therefore, some semblance of hierarchy is needed. Hierarchical organiza-
tion of internetworked machines creates the need for specialized routing functions.

Routers can specialize in learning about and distributing routing information within their 
domain. These routers are called interior gateways. Alternatively, routers can specialize in col-
lecting routing information about networks that lie beyond their domain. These routers are 
known as exterior gateways.
Networking is often used as a generic or universal term. However, networked machines com-
municate in tremendously different ways. Routers can function in different capacities in an 
internetwork, for example, as interior, exterior, or border routers.
As you might have noticed in the previous paragraphs, ﬁnding interior routers, exterior routers, 
and border routers described as interior gateways, exterior gateways, and border gateways,
respectively, is not uncommon. The term gateway is as old as routing itself. Over time, this 
term has lost some of its descriptive value. Consequently, both sets of terms are technically 
correct, except in the presence of technological purists. Then you have to determine which ter-
minology they consider correct!
These functional specializations are more than merely academic. Understanding the differ-
ences among them requires examining them in the context of a WAN. Therefore, a logical start-
ing point is an examination of the context. The terms WAN, network, internetwork, and 
autonomous system are all used interchangeably, yet each has a slightly different meaning:
■WAN—A WAN is a collection of related LANs linked via routers and serial transmission 
facilities, such as leased lines or Frame Relay circuits. Implicit in this deﬁnition is that the 
LANs in the WAN might be geographically dispersed, but they still fall under the auspices 
of a single organization such as a company or school.
■Network—Network is a more nebulous term that deﬁes speciﬁcity. Everything from LANs 
to WANs can be classiﬁed as a network. Consequently, for the purposes of this book, a 
network identiﬁes a generic collection of related networking mechanisms. Therefore, 
a network can be a LAN or a WAN, but it must belong to a single organization and feature a 
consistent addressing architecture. This term is sometimes used to indicate an internet-
work or even the Internet.
■Internetwork—Internetwork is only slightly more concrete than network. An internetwork 
is a collection of loosely related networks that are interconnected. The interconnected net-
works can belong to different organizations. For example, two companies can use the 
Internet to interconnect their private WANs. The resulting internetwork consists of one 
public network and two private networks linked together. The most common deﬁnition of 
internetwork is a set of networks linked by routers. This internetwork is not necessarily a 
loosely related set of networks, although the term is applied to both a single domain or 
autonomous system (AS) internetwork or an internetwork comprised of separate autono-
mous systems.

WAN Routers
539
More Information: Roles of the Router in WANs (Continued)
■Autonomous system—An autonomous system (AS) is a network or internetwork (either 
LAN or WAN) that is relatively self-contained. It is administered by a single person (or 
organization), features a single routed protocol, has an address architecture, and usually 
involves just one routing protocol. An autonomous system can support connections to 
other autonomous systems owned and operated by the same organization. Alternatively, 
an AS might have connections to other networks, such as the Internet, yet it retains auton-
omy of operation. This term is usually used in conjunction with speciﬁc routing protocols, 
such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), that enable a 
network to be carved into numbered subsections.
Given these deﬁnitions, it is possible to better deﬁne the functional classes of routers. An inte-
rior router is one that can be used by end systems in a network to access other end systems 
within the same network. The interior router supports no connections to any other network. 
Figure 10-11 illustrates a small network and identiﬁes those devices that function as interior 
routers.
Figure 10-11 Interior Routers in a Network
An exterior router is one that lies beyond the boundaries of any given network. Figure 10-12, 
although not pretending to depict the Internet’s actual topology, presents a highly simpliﬁed 
Internet topology that is solely intended to demonstrate what an exterior router is.

The last functional class of router is the border router. As the name implies, border routers 
interconnect a network with other networks. It is important to note that a single entity might 
own and operate multiple autonomous systems. Therefore, a border router may denote the 
boundary between two autonomous systems rather than the border between a private network 
and some other network. Figure 10-13 identiﬁes the border routers in the sample network that 
was used in Figure 10-11 and Figure 10-12.

Lab WAN Simulation
A viable WAN connection can connect routers from around the world. In an academy 
lab, all the networks are connected with a serial or Ethernet cable, and the students 
can see and physically touch the equipment. In a real-world situation, one router could 
be in New York, while another router could be in Sydney, Australia. An administrator 
located in Sydney would have to connect to the router in New York through the WAN 
cloud to troubleshoot the New York router.
In the academy lab, the whole dedicated circuit cloud has been made extremely small 
and put in the “crack” between the back-to-back DTE-DCE cables. The connection 
from one router’s interface s0/0 to another's router interface s0/1 simulates the entire 
circuit cloud.
Note that clocking must be conﬁgured, or this will not work properly for the use of 
CSU/DSU.
More Information: Internetworking Scenarios
Having examined the concepts underlying routing and internetworking, as well as some of the 
terminology inherent with these topics, you can see how they are used by examining three 
internetworking scenarios. Each scenario demonstrates some of the issues that need to be 
addressed in any network or internetwork:
■Routing within a network
■Routing between adjacent networks
■Routing between nonadjacent networks
These three generic aspects encompass virtually every form of internetworking that you are 
likely to encounter. Each one holds different implications for the network administrator, includ-
ing such routing aspects as route calculation and distribution, convergence, and security. The 
following sections provide an overview of each internetworking scenario and highlight the 
areas of concern for a network administrator. The various potential resolutions to these routing 
concerns are presented throughout this book.
Routing Within a Network
The simplest form of routing is routing within the conﬁnes of a single network. Such a network 
contains just interior routers. In theory, this form of network uses just one routed protocol, one 
address architecture, and a minimum number of destinations. This structure greatly reduces 
the workload of each router and maximizes potential network performance. Therefore, the 
routing issues in intranetwork routing are more closely related to the network’s size and topol-
ogy than to its address architectures and routing protocols. The topology must be carefully 
selected to match the requirements of the user community.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
More Information: Internetworking Scenarios (Continued)
If the network is small enough, it might be feasible for the administrator to preprogram all the 
possible routes statically rather than introduce the complexity of a dynamic routing protocol. 
Statically programmed routes, however, can become an onerous burden in a growing or con-
stantly changing network. You have to go to each router and manually update each time a 
change occurs in the network rather than having routers automatically update.
Routing Between Adjacent Networks
A small step up in complexity from intranetwork routing is internetwork routing between adja-
cent networks. Physical adjacency means that the two networks are directly connected to each 
other. Such an adjacency might have been designed to promote rapid convergence, improve 
security, or satisfy any number of other performance criteria.
The logical separation of the multiple networks implies that the border routers must summa-
rize and redistribute routing information between them. In this fashion, the end systems of one 
network can directly address the end systems in another network. Figure 10-14 illustrates this 
type of routing.
Figure 10-14 Routing Between Adjacent Networks
The routing issues you need to address in this type of internetwork arise from the differences 
between the two networks. Some of the potential differences that must be identiﬁed include 
the following:
■Do the networks belong to the same organization? If not, the border routers need to 
secure the network’s perimeter.
■Do the networks use the same routing protocol? If not, you need to ﬁnd some mutually 
acceptable metric.
■Do the networks use the same routed protocol? If not, you might have to support a second 
routed protocol in your network to facilitate internetworking.

More Information: Internetworking Scenarios (Continued)
Additionally, topology can affect routing between adjacent networks. Using a single point of 
interconnection between the two networks, for example, makes it easy to control the calculation 
and redistribution of routing information between the networks. This convenience introduces 
a single point of failure, however, and it might not be acceptable to your users. Introducing a 
second (or more) interconnection point solves the single point of failure problem but can 
create the opportunity for inﬁnite routing loops to occur. Resolving such a dilemma requires an 
understanding of your users’ tolerance for downtime and risk. Armed with this understanding, 
you can evaluate speciﬁc routing protocols for their capabilities to converge quickly and com-
pensate for potential routing problems.
Routing Between Nonadjacent Networks
Routing between nonadjacent networks is simultaneously the most complicated and useful 
type of routing. Two networks can use a third network as an intermediary. It is highly likely that 
the three different networks will use different routing protocols, routed protocols, and address 
architectures. Therefore, the boundary router’s job is to overcome these obstacles to commu-
nication while also guarding the border of its network. Figure 10-15 illustrates routing between 
nonadjacent small networks.
Figure 10-15 Routing Between Nonadjacent Networks
The border router of each private network in this illustration needs to protect the border of its 
network from unwanted intrusion. Because the two networks that need to communicate aren’t 
adjacent and the intermediary network is beyond their control, the risks of unwanted intrusion 
are much higher than if the networks were directly internetworked. Therefore, the network 
administrators must develop a set of criteria for allowing speciﬁc external users into their net-
work, while disallowing access to everyone else. The border router implements these criteria 
in an access control list.

Chapter 10: WANs and Routers
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following the key points:
■The Internet is the interconnection of thousands of large and small networks all 
over the world.
■A WAN is used to interconnect LANs that are separated by a large geographic 
distance.
■Dedicated line, circuit-switching, packet-switching, and cell-switching are some 
of the common WAN connection types.
■Many types of WAN services are available to the WAN subscriber, who must 
know how to interface to the WAN provider’s service.
■WAN devices include routers, WAN switches, modems, CSUs/DSUs, and access 
servers.
■WAN physical layer protocols describe how to provide electrical, mechanical, 
operational, and functional connection for WAN services.
■WAN data link layer protocols describe how frames are carried between systems 
on a single data link.
To supplement all that you’ve learned in this chapter, refer to the chapter-speciﬁc Videos, 
PhotoZooms, and e-Lab activities on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.
More Information: Internetworking Scenarios (Continued)
Another responsibility of the border router is to summarize the internal routes and redistribute 
this information to the networks beyond. This process enables users outside the bounds of the 
private network to access its end systems. If this routing information isn’t distributed, no one 
outside that private network is able to access its end systems.
Finally, it is highly likely that the border routers will have to be conﬁgured to use multiple routing 
protocols. An interior gateway protocol will likely be selected for intranetwork routing 
purposes. Calculating routes across the internetwork, however, might require a different proto-
col—one that features stronger support for route summarization. Route summarization can 
reduce routing table size by aggregating routes to multiple networks into one or two routing 
entries.

Chapter 11
Router Fundamentals
In this chapter, you learn how to start a router for the ﬁrst time by using the correct com-
mands and startup sequence to do an initial conﬁguration of the router. This chapter also 
explains the startup sequence of a router and the setup dialog that the router uses to create 
an initial conﬁguration ﬁle using current versions of Cisco Internetwork Operating System 
(IOS) Software. 
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Lab Activities, Videos, and PhotoZooms 
that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Router Boot Sequence and Setup Mode
A router initializes by loading the bootstrap, the operating system, and a conﬁguration 
ﬁle. If the router cannot ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle, it enters setup mode. The router stores 
a backup copy of the new conﬁguration created from setup mode in nonvolatile random-
access memory (NVRAM).
When a Cisco router powers up, it performs a power-on self-test (POST). During this 
self-test, the router performs diagnostics from ROM on all hardware modules. These 
diagnostics verify the basic operation of the CPU, memory, and network interface ports. 
After verifying the hardware functions, the router proceeds with software initialization, 
characterized by the following two processes:
■System startup routines initiate router software.
■Fallback routines provide startup alternatives as needed.
1102.book  Page 553  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
The goal of the startup routines for Cisco IOS Software is to start the router opera-
tions. The router must deliver reliable performance in its job of connecting the user 
networks that it was conﬁgured to serve. To do this, the startup routines must do the 
following:
1. Make sure that the router hardware is tested and functional. 
2. Find and load the Cisco IOS software that the router uses for its operating 
system.
3. Find and apply the startup conﬁguration ﬁle or enter the setup mode.
Router Startup Sequence
After the POST, the following events occur as the router initializes:
1. The generic bootstrap loader in ROM is carried out. A bootstrap is a simple, pre-
set operation that loads instructions. These instructions then cause other instruc-
tions to be loaded into memory or cause entry into other conﬁguration modes. 
2. The Cisco IOS Software image can be found in several places. The boot ﬁeld of 
the conﬁguration register determines the location to be used in loading Cisco IOS 
Software images. If the boot ﬁeld indicates a Flash memory or network load, boot
system commands in the conﬁguration ﬁle indicate the exact name and location 
of the image. 
3. The Cisco IOS Software image is loaded. Then, when Cisco IOS Software is 
loaded and operational, the operating system locates the hardware and software 
components and lists the results on the console terminal. 
4. The conﬁguration ﬁle saved in NVRAM is loaded into main memory and exe-
cuted one line at a time. The conﬁguration commands start routing processes, 
supply addresses for interfaces, set media characteristics, and so on. 
5. If no valid conﬁguration ﬁle exists in NVRAM, or if NVRAM is erased, the oper-
ating system executes a question-driven initial conﬁguration routine referred to 
as the system conﬁguration dialog, also called the setup dialog when the router is 
rebooted.
Figure 11-1 shows the startup sequence.

Router Boot Sequence and Setup Mode

Figure 11-1 Startup Sequence
System Conﬁguration Dialog
Setup is not intended as the mode for entering complex protocol features in the router. 
The main purpose of setup mode is to quickly install a minimal conﬁguration for any 
router that cannot ﬁnd its conﬁguration from another source.
For many of the prompts in the system conﬁguration dialog of the setup command 
facility, default answers appear in square brackets ([ ]) following the question. Press 
the Enter key to use these defaults.
If the system has been previously conﬁgured, the defaults that appear will be the cur-
rently conﬁgured values. To get a fresh start, the command erase startup-conﬁg can be 
used to remove the current conﬁguration ﬁle from NVRAM. The reload command 
reboots the router and initiates setup again. If the system is being conﬁgured for the 
ﬁrst time, the factory defaults are provided. If there is no factory default, as in the case 
of passwords, nothing is displayed after the question mark (?). During the setup pro-
cess, you can press Ctrl-C at any time to terminate the process and start over. When 
setup is terminated, all interfaces will administratively are shut down. Example 11-1 
shows the setup command.

When the conﬁguration process is completed in setup mode, the screen displays the 
conﬁguration that was created. When you are asked whether to use this conﬁguration, 
enter yes; the conﬁguration executes and is saved to NVRAM. If you enter no, the con-
ﬁguration is not saved and the process begins again. If a --More-- prompt appears, 
press the spacebar to continue to another screen of information.
Setting Up Global Parameters
After you view the current interface summary, a prompt appears on your monitor, as 
shown in Example 11-2, indicating that you must enter the global parameters for your 
router. These parameters are the conﬁguration values that you select.
The ﬁrst statement indicates that you are conﬁguring the global parameters in the 
router. The ﬁrst global parameter enables you to set the router host name. This host 
name will be part of the Cisco IOS Software prompts for all EXEC modes. At initial 
conﬁguration, the router name default is displayed between square brackets as [Router]. 
After you set the router name default, you need to set the various passwords used on 
the router.
Use ctrl-c to abort configuration dialog at any prompt.
Default settings are in square brackets '[]'.
Basic management setup configures only enough connectivity

You must enter an enable password. When you enter a string of password characters 
for the prompt Enter enable secret, the characters are processed by Cisco-proprietary 
encryption. This enhances the security of the password string. Whenever anyone lists 
the contents of the router conﬁguration ﬁle, this enable password appears as a mean-
ingless string of characters.
Setup recommends, but does not require, that the enable password be different than 
the enable secret word. The enable secret word is a one-way cryptographic secret word 
that is used instead of the enable password, when it exists. The enable password is 
used when no enable secret word exists. Because of this one-way encryption, the enable 
secret password cannot be recovered if forgotten, whereas the enable password is clear 
text and can be read from the conﬁg ﬁle.
The enable password also is used with other versions of Cisco IOS Software. All pass-
words are case sensitive and can be alphanumeric.
It is possible to secure the router by using passwords to restrict access to individual 
lines as well. Example 11-3 uses the line-console 0 command followed by the login and
password subcommands to establish a login password for the console terminal. The 
purpose here is to establish the need for a user to log into the console before gaining 
Example 11-2 Global Parameters 
Configuring global parameters:
  Enter host name [Router]: Cisco
  The enable secret is a password used to protect access to
  privileged EXEC and configuration modes. This password, after
  entered, becomes encrypted in the configuration.
  Enter enable secret: cougars
  The enable password is used when you do not specify an
  enable secret password, with some older software versions, and
  some boot images.
  Enter enable password: lumberjacks
  The virtual terminal password is used to protect
  access to the router over a network interface.
  Enter virtual terminal password: matadors

access to the router. console 0 designates the router’s console connection, and login
prompts the user for a password before allowing console connectivity.
As demonstrated in Example 11-4, the line vty 0 4 command followed by the pass-
word subcommand establishes a login password on incoming Telnet sessions.
After you enter the passwords for the various ports, the router asks you to enter the 
routing protocols that are to be used, as shown in Example 11-5. When you are 
prompted for parameters for each protocol, use the conﬁguration values that you have 
selected for your router. Whenever you answer yes to a prompt, additional questions 
might appear regarding the protocol.

Router LED Indicators
Cisco routers use light-emitting diode (LED) indicators to provide status information. 
Depending on the Cisco router model, the LED indicators vary.
The upper LED on the daughter card indicates the activity on serial 1 port on the 
daughter card. The lower LED on the daughter card indicates the activity of the WAN, 
or BRI port. Figures 11-2 and 11-3 illustrate the router LED indicators.
Do you want to configure Serial1  interface? [yes]: n

The LEDs on the interface indicate the activity of the corresponding interface. If the 
LED is not on when the interface is active, and the interface is correctly connected, 
this might indicate a problem. If an interface is extremely busy, its LED is always on. 
The green OK LED on the bottom of both WAN interface cards comes on after the 
system initializes correctly.
Initial Router Boot-Up Output
Each time a router is powered on, it goes through the following boot sequence:
1. The router goes through POST diagnostics to verify basic operation of the CPU, 
memory, and interfaces.

2. To verify that the system bootstrap software is loaded correctly, the boot image 
executes and searches for a valid Cisco IOS Software image (router operating 
system software). The source of the Cisco IOS Software image, whether a Flash 
memory or a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server, is determined by the 
conﬁguration register setting. The factory-default setting for the conﬁguration 
register is 0x2102. This indicates that the router should attempt to load a Cisco 
IOS Software image from Flash memory.
3. If after ﬁve attempts a valid Cisco IOS Software image is not found in Flash 
memory, the router reverts to boot ROM mode. This mode is used to install 
or upgrade a Cisco IOS Software image.
4. If a valid Cisco IOS Software image is found, the router searches for a valid 
conﬁguration ﬁle.
5. If a valid conﬁguration ﬁle is not found in NVRAM, the router searches for a TFTP 
server over all interfaces. If a conﬁguration ﬁle is not found, the router runs the 
system conﬁguration dialog so a conﬁguration can be manually conﬁgured.
In Examples 11-6 and 11-7, the messages displayed vary, depending on the interfaces 
in the router and the Cisco IOS release. The screen displays in this graphic are for ref-
erence only and might not exactly reﬂect the screen displays on the console. 
Notice in Example 11-6 that the NVRAM is invalid; this is possibly because of write 
erase. This tells the user that the router has not been conﬁgured for the ﬁrst time or 
that the NVRAM has been erased. A router cannot be used until it is conﬁgured.

Establishing a HyperTerminal Session
All Cisco routers include an EIA/TIA-232 asynchronous serial console port (RJ-45). 
Cables and adapters are needed to connect a console terminal (an ASCII terminal or 
PC running terminal emulation software) to the console port. To connect a PC running 
terminal emulation software to the console port, use the RJ-45–to–RJ-45 rollover 
cable with a female RJ-45–to–DB-9 or RJ-45–to–DB-25 adapter.

The default parameters for the console port are 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 
1 stop bit, and no ﬂow control. The console port does not support hardware ﬂow 
control.
Take the following steps to connect a terminal to the console port on the router:
Step 1
Connect the terminal or PC using the RJ-45–to–RJ-45 rollover cable 
and an RJ-45–to–DB-9 or RJ-45–to–DB-25 adapter.
Step 2
Conﬁgure the terminal or PC terminal emulation software for 9600 
baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, and no ﬂow control.

Logging into the Router
565
Logging into the Router
To conﬁgure Cisco routers, the user interface must be accessed on the router with a ter-
minal or by remote access. When accessing a router, a user must log into the router 
before any other commands are entered. 
For security purposes, the router has two levels of access to commands, as demonstrated 
by Example 11-9:
■User EXEC mode—Typical tasks include those that check the router status. 
In this mode, router conﬁguration changes are not allowed. 
■Privileged EXEC mode—Typical tasks include those that change the router 
conﬁguration.
The user EXEC mode prompt is displayed upon login to a router. Commands available 
at this user level are a subset of the commands available at the privileged EXEC level. 
For the most part, these commands enable a user to display information without 
changing router conﬁguration settings.
To access the full set of commands, privileged EXEC mode must be entered. At the > 
prompt, type enable. At the password prompt, enter the password that has been set 
with the enable secret command. When the login steps have been completed, the prompt 
changes to a #, to indicate that you are now in privileged EXEC mode. From privileged 
EXEC mode, global conﬁguration mode and other speciﬁc modes, including the fol-
lowing, can be accessed:
■Interface (central_2(conﬁg-if)#)
■Subinterface (central_2(conﬁg-subif)#
■Line (central_2(conﬁg-line)#)
■Router (central_2(conﬁg-router)#)
■Route-map (central_2(conﬁg-map-class)#)

one time. The --More-- prompt at the bottom of the display indicates that multiple 
screens are available as output. Whenever a --More-- prompt appears, you can view 
the next available screen by pressing the spacebar. To display just the next line, press 
the Enter key. Press any other key to return to the prompt.
More Information: Basic Operation of Cisco IOS Software
The Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) Software platform is implemented on the various 
hardware used in this course. It is the embedded software architecture in all the Cisco routers.
Cisco IOS Software enables the following network services in these products:
■Features to carry the chosen network protocols and functions
■Connectivity for high-speed trafﬁc between devices
■Security to control access and discourage unauthorized network use
■Scalability to add interfaces and capability as needed for network growth
■Reliability to ensure dependable access to networked resources
The Cisco IOS Software command-line interface (CLI) can be accessed through a console con-
nection, a modem connection, or a Telnet session. Regardless of which connection method is 
used, access to the IOS command-line interface generally is referred to as an EXEC session.

Router Help Functions
Suppose that a user wants to set the router clock. If the necessary command is not 
known, that user can use the help function to check the syntax for setting the clock. 
The following exercise illustrates one of the many uses of the help function. The task is 
to set the router clock. Assuming that the command is not known, proceed using the 
following steps:
Step 1
Use ? to ﬁnd the command for setting the clock. The help output shows 
that the clock command is required. 
Step 2
Check the syntax for changing the time. 
Step 3
Enter the current time by using hours, minutes, and seconds, as shown. 
The system indicates that additional information needs to be provided to 
complete the command. The help output in Example 11-12 shows that 
the set keyword is required.

Cisco IOS Software Editing Commands
571
Step 5
Press Ctrl + P or the up arrow to repeat the previous command entry 
automatically. Then add a space and a question mark (?) to reveal the 
additional arguments. Now the command entry can be completed. 
Step 6
The caret symbol (^) and help response indicate that there is an error. 
The placement of the caret symbol shows where the possible problem 
is located. To input the correct syntax, re-enter the command up to the 
point where the caret symbol is located, and then enter a question mark (?).
Step 7
Enter the year, using the correct syntax, and press Enter to execute the 
command.
The user interface provides syntax checking by placing a ^ where the error occurred. 
The ^ appears at the point in the command string where an incorrect command, key-
word, or argument was entered. The error location indicator and interactive help system 
enable syntax errors to be found and easily corrected.
Cisco IOS Software Editing Commands
The user interface includes an enhanced editing mode that provides a set of editing 
key functions with which the user can edit a command line as it is being typed. Use 
the key sequences indicated in Table 11-2 to move the cursor at the command line for 
corrections or changes. Although enhanced editing mode automatically is enabled with 
the current software release, it can be disabled if written scripts do not interact well 
while enhanced editing is enabled. To disable enhanced editing mode, type terminal no 
editing at the privileged EXEC mode prompt.

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
The editing command set provides a horizontal scrolling feature for commands that 
extend beyond a single line on the screen. When the cursor reaches the right margin, 
the command line shifts ten spaces to the left. The ﬁrst ten characters of the line cannot 
be seen, but a user can scroll back and check the syntax at the beginning of the com-
mand. To scroll back, press Ctrl+ b or the left arrow key repeatedly until the beginning 
of the command entry is reached. Ctrl + a returns a user directly to the beginning of 
the line.
In Example 11-14, the command entry extends beyond one line. When the cursor ﬁrst 
reaches the end of the line, the line is shifted ten spaces to the left and is redisplayed. 
The dollar sign ($) indicates that the line has been scrolled to the left. Each time the 
cursor reaches the end of the line, the line again is shifted ten spaces to the left.
Screen output varies, depending on the Cisco IOS Software level and router conﬁguration.
The Ctrl + z command backs out of conﬁguration mode. This command returns the 
user to the privileged EXEC mode prompt.
Router Command History
The user interface provides a history, or record, of commands that have been entered. 
This feature is particularly useful for recalling long or complex commands or entries. 
With the command history feature, the following tasks can be completed:
■Set the command history buffer size 
■Recall commands 
■Disable the command history feature 
Esc + b
Moves back one word
Ctrl + f
Moves forward one character
Ctrl + b

By default, the command history is enabled and the system records ten command lines 
in its history buffer. To change the number of command lines that the system records 
during a terminal session, use the terminal history size or the history size commands. 
The maximum number of commands is 256. Table 11-3 shows command history 
commands.
To recall commands in the history buffer, beginning with the most recent command, 
press Ctrl + p. Continue to press Ctrl + p or the up arrow key to recall successively 
older commands. To return to more recent commands in the history buffer, after using 
the Ctrl + p or the up arrow, press Ctrl + n or the down arrow key repeatedly to recall 
successively more recent commands.
When typing commands, as a shortcut, you can enter the unique characters for a com-
mand. Press the Tab key, and the interface ﬁnishes the entry. When the typed letters 
uniquely identify the command, the Tab key simply acknowledges visually that the 
router has understood the speciﬁc command that was intended.
On most computers, additional select and copy functions are available. A previous 
command string can be copied and then pasted or inserted as the current command 
entry.

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
Cisco IOS Software Fundamentals
Like any computer, a router or switch cannot function without an operating system. 
Cisco calls its operating system the Cisco Internetwork Operating System, or Cisco 
IOS Software. It is the embedded software architecture in almost all of the Cisco routers 
and Catalyst switches. Some Catalyst switches use a Cisco command-line interface 
(CLI). A router does not become functional until it loads Cisco IOS Software. Without 
an operating system, the hardware has no capability. Cisco IOS Software provides the 
following network services:
■Basic routing and switching functions
■Reliable and secure access to networked resources
■Network scalability
Operation of Cisco IOS Software
Cisco IOS Software devices have three distinct operating environments or modes: 
■ROM monitor
■Boot ROM
■Cisco IOS
The startup process of the router normally loads into RAM and performs in one of 
these operating environments. The conﬁguration register setting can be used by system 
administrators to control which of these modes is used by the router to load. 
The ROM monitor performs the bootstrap process and provides low-level functionality 
and diagnostics. The ROM monitor is used to recover from system failures and to 
recover a lost password. The ROM monitor cannot be accessed through any of the 
network interfaces, but only through a console port session. 
When the router is running in boot ROM mode, only a limited subset of the Cisco IOS 
Software feature set is available. Boot ROM allows write operations to Flash memory 
and is used primarily to replace the Cisco IOS Software image that is stored in Flash 
Lab Activity
Command Line Fundamentals
In this lab, you log into a router in both user and privilege modes. You use 
several basic router commands to determine how the router is conﬁgured. You 
also become familiar with the router help facility and use the command history 
and editing features.

Cisco IOS Software Fundamentals
575
memory. The Cisco IOS Software image can be modiﬁed in boot ROM mode by using 
the copy tftp ﬂash command, which copies an IOS image stored on a TFTP server into 
the Flash memory of the router. 
The normal operation of a router requires the full Cisco IOS Software image from 
Flash memory. In some devices, the IOS is performed directly from Flash. However, 
most Cisco routers require a copy of the Cisco IOS Software image to be loaded into 
RAM and also executed from RAM. Some Cisco IOS Software images are stored in 
Flash in a compressed format and must be expanded when copied to RAM.
To see the Cisco IOS Software image and version that is running, use the show version 
command, which also indicates the conﬁguration register setting. The show ﬂash com-
mand in Example 11-15 veriﬁes that the system has sufﬁcient memory to load a new 
Cisco IOS Software image. 
Cisco IOS Software Features
Cisco provides Cisco IOS Software images for devices spanning a wide range of net-
work product platforms. To optimize the Cisco IOS Software required by various 
product platforms, Cisco is working to develop many different Cisco IOS Software 
images. Each image represents a different feature set that serves the various device 
platforms, available memory resources, and customers’ needs.
Numerous Cisco IOS Software images exist for different Cisco device models and 
feature sets. However, the basic conﬁguration command structure is the same. The 
conﬁguration and troubleshooting skills acquired on any one device apply across a 
wide range of products.
The naming convention for the different Cisco IOS Software releases contains three parts: 
■The platform on which the image runs 
■The special capabilities supported in the image 
■Where the image runs and whether it has been zipped or compressed
Example 11-15 Verifying the Cisco IOS Software Image

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
This material is covered in more detail in Chapter 14, “Managing Cisco IOS Software.” 
The Cisco IOS Software naming conventions, image content, and other details are 
subject to change. 
After choosing the options that meet the network requirements, select a Cisco IOS 
Software release that is supported by the hardware. The software requirements of each 
device are listed in the “Cisco Product Documentation” section of the Documentation 
CD. The Cisco Software Advisor is an interactive tool that provides the most current 
information.
One of the main considerations when selecting a new IOS image is that it is compatible 
with the router ﬂash and RAM memory. In general, the newer the release is and the 
more features it provides, the more memory it requires. Use the show version com-
mand, as shown in Example 11-13, from the Cisco device to check the current image 
and available Flash memory. The Cisco support site has tools available to help determine 
the amount of Flash memory and RAM required for each image. 
Before installing a new Cisco IOS Software image on the router, check to see if the 
router meets the memory requirements for that image. To see the amount of RAM, 
issue the show version command and look for the following output in Example 11-16.
The highlighted line shows how much main and shared memory is installed in the 
router. Some platforms use a fraction of dynamic RAM (DRAM) as shared memory. 
The memory requirements take this into account, so both numbers must be added to 
determine the amount of DRAM installed on the router. 
To determine the amount of free Flash memory, issue the show ﬂash command, as 
shown in Example 11-17.

The show version Command
The show version command displays information about the Cisco IOS Software version 
that currently is running on the router. This includes the conﬁguration register and the 
boot ﬁeld setting.

■Bootstrap ROM version
■Boot ROM version
■Router up time
■Last restart method
■System image ﬁle and location

Router User Interface
Recall that the Cisco IOS Software uses a command-line interface (CLI) as its tradi-
tional console environment. Cisco IOS Software is a core technology that extends 
across most of the Cisco product line. Its operation details vary, depending upon the 
internetworking device using it.
This CLI environment is accessible through several methods: 
■Through a console session. A console uses a low-speed serial connection directly 
from a computer or terminal to the console connection on the router. This method 
does not require the conﬁguration of network services on the router.
■Through a dialup connection by using a modem or a null modem connected to 
the router AUX port. This method does not require the conﬁguration of network 
services on the router, either.

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
■Through a Telnet connection to the router as a virtual terminal. To establish a 
Telnet session to the router, at least one interface must be conﬁgured for IP. Virtual 
terminal sessions also must be conﬁgured for login and passwords.
Router User Interface and Modes
The Cisco CLI uses a hierarchical structure. This structure requires entry into different 
modes to accomplish particular tasks. For example, interface conﬁguration mode must 
be entered to conﬁgure a router interface. From interface conﬁguration mode, all con-
ﬁgurations entered apply only to that particular interface. Each command mode is 
indicated with a distinctive prompt and allows only commands that are appropriate 
for that mode.
Cisco IOS Software provides a command interpreter service known as the command 
executive (EXEC). After each command is entered, the EXEC validates and executes 
the command.
As a security feature, Cisco IOS Software separates the EXEC sessions into two access 
levels. These levels are user EXEC mode and privileged EXEC mode, which is also 
known as enable mode.
User EXEC mode allows only a limited number of basic monitoring commands. This 
often is referred to as a view-only mode. The user EXEC level does not allow any com-
mands that could change the conﬁguration of the router. The user EXEC mode can be 
identiﬁed by the > prompt. 
Privileged EXEC mode provides access to all router commands. Privileged EXEC mode 
can be protected by requiring a user ID and a password. This mode allows only autho-
rized users to access the router. Conﬁguration and management commands require 
that the network administrator be at the privileged EXEC level. Global conﬁguration 
mode and all other more speciﬁc conﬁguration modes can be reached only from privi-
leged EXEC mode. Privileged EXEC mode can be identiﬁed on the CLI session by the 
# prompt.
To access the privileged EXEC level from the user EXEC level, enter the enable com-
mand at the > prompt. If a password is conﬁgured, the router asks for a password at 
this point. For security reasons, a Cisco network device will not show the password 
that is entered. When the correct password is entered, the router prompt changes to #, 
indicating that the user is now at the privileged EXEC level. Entering a question mark 
(?) at the privileged EXEC level reveals many more command options than those avail-
able at the user EXEC level.

Troubleshooting Cisco IOS Software
579
Troubleshooting Cisco IOS Software
Several things could prevent the router from booting properly:
■Conﬁguration ﬁle with a missing or incorrect boot system statement
■Incorrect conﬁguration register value
■Corrupted Flash image
■Hardware failure
When the router boots, it looks in the conﬁguration ﬁle for a boot system statement. 
This statement can force the router to boot from another image instead of the Cisco 
IOS Software image in Flash. To identify the boot image source, type the show version 
command and look for the line that identiﬁes the image boot source, as shown in 
Example 11-18. 
An incorrect conﬁguration register setting prevents the Cisco IOS Software from loading 
from Flash memory. The value in the conﬁguration register tells the router where to 
get the Cisco IOS Software image. This can be conﬁrmed by using the show version 
command and looking at the last line for the conﬁguration register, as shown in 
Example 11-19.
The correct value varies in different hardware platforms. The Cisco IOS Software doc-
umentation should include a printed copy of the show version output. If that docu-
mentation is not available, there are resources on the Cisco Documentation CD or at 
Cisco.com to identify the correct conﬁguration register value. Correct this by changing 
the conﬁguration register in the conﬁguration and saving this as the startup conﬁguration.

Chapter 11: Router Fundamentals
If there is still a problem, the router might have a corrupted Flash image ﬁle. If this is 
the case, an error message should be displayed during boot. The error message might 
display as follows:
open: read error...requested 0x4 bytes, got 0x0
trouble reading device magic number
boot: cannot open "flash:"
boot: cannot determine first file name on device "flash:"ú
If the Flash image is corrupt, a new Cisco IOS Software image should be uploaded into 
the router. If the problem has not been identiﬁed in this section, the router could have 
a hardware failure. If this is the case, you should contact the Cisco Technical Assistance 
Center (TAC). Although hardware failures are rare, they do occur.
Table 11-4 lists and describes other helpful router status commands. You can obtain a 
list of all show commands by entering the show command followed by a space and a 
question mark.

An interface that enables the user to interact with 
the operating system by entering commands and optional arguments.
daughter card
Similar to an expansion board, but it accesses the motherboard 
components (memory and CPU) directly instead of sending data through the slower 
expansion bus.
Flash memory
A special type of EEPROM that can be erased and reprogrammed 
in blocks instead of 1 byte at a time. Many modern PCs have their BIOS stored on a 
Flash memory chip so that it can be updated easily, if necessary. Flash memory is also 
popular in modems because it enables the modem manufacturer to support new protocols 
as they become standardized.
light-emitting diode (LED)
Semiconductor device that emits light produced by 
converting electrical energy. Status lights on hardware devices are typically LEDs.
nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM)
RAM that retains its contents when a unit is powered off. 
power-on self-test (POST)
Set of hardware diagnostics that runs on a hardware 
device when that device is powered up.

Chapter 12
Router Conﬁguration
This chapter covers the router modes and conﬁguration methods to update a router’s con-
ﬁguration ﬁle. It is important to have a ﬁrm understanding of Cisco IOS Software and 
know the procedures for starting a router. In addition, this chapter describes the tasks 
necessary for password recovery.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that you will ﬁnd 
on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed to supple-
ment the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Command-Line Interface Command Modes
To gain access to a router, a login is required. After login, there is a choice of modes. The 
modes interpret the commands that are typed and carry out the operations. Two EXEC 
modes exist:
■User mode
■Privilege mode (or enable mode)
The following sections deﬁne the two command modes and their associated commands.
User Command List
A user is automatically in user EXEC mode upon ﬁrst login to the router. User mode is a 
limited examination of the router. Table 12-1 provides the user mode commands and 
their descriptions.

Privileged Mode Command List
Privileged EXEC mode provides a detailed examination of the router and allows con-
ﬁguration changes to be made to the router. A speciﬁc mode is entered depending upon 
the conﬁguration change that is required. From privileged EXEC mode, other modes 
can be entered; privileged EXEC mode must be entered before entering these other 
modes (see the next section, “Router Conﬁguration Modes”). 
To access privileged mode from user EXEC mode, type enable (or the abbreviation en):
Router>enable
Password:
Router>en
Password:
You are prompted for a password. If you type a question mark (?) at the privileged 
mode prompt Router#?, the screen displays a longer list of commands than it would at 
the user mode prompt. Table 12-2 provides a complete list with descriptions of privi-
leged mode commands.

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Router Conﬁguration Modes
Global conﬁguration commands are used in a router to apply conﬁguration statements 
that affect the system as a whole. Use the privileged EXEC command conﬁgure to 
enter global conﬁguration mode. After this command is entered, a prompt asking for 
the source of the conﬁguration commands appears, at which you can specify terminal, 
nvram, or network. The default selection is to type in commands from the terminal 
console. Pressing the Enter key begins this conﬁguration method.
The ﬁrst conﬁguration mode is referred to as global conﬁguration mode, or global con-
ﬁg, for short. Table 12-3 describes some of the conﬁguration modes that you access 
from global conﬁguration mode.

Typing exit at one of these speciﬁc conﬁguration modes returns the router to global 
conﬁguration mode. Pressing Ctrl-Z leaves the conﬁguration modes completely and 
returns the router to privileged EXEC mode.

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Router Startup Modes
Whether it is accessed from the console or by a Telnet session through a vty port, 
a router can be placed in several modes. Each mode provides different functions:
■ROM monitor mode is generally a recovery mode. It allows certain conﬁguration 
tasks, such as recovering a lost password or downloading software (IOS). The 
router boots into ROM monitor mode if the router does not ﬁnd a valid system 
image or if the boot sequence is interrupted during startup. In many routers, 
Rommon> is the default prompt for ROM monitor mode.
■Setup mode is a prompted dialog that helps users create a ﬁrst-time basic conﬁg-
uration. Setup mode consists of a series of questions with default answers in 
brackets. Setup mode does not have a deﬁning default prompt. The router 
prompts the user to enter setup mode if a valid startup conﬁguration ﬁle is not 
found. Setup can also be entered by typing setup from privileged mode. Note that 
setup mode also can be invoked manually if the user erased the NVRAM and 
rebooted the router. 
■RXBoot mode is a special mode that the router can enter by changing the set-
tings of the conﬁguration register and rebooting the router. RXBoot mode pro-
vides the router with a subset of Cisco IOS Software and enters a streamlined 
setup mode. The streamlined setup mode differs from the standard setup mode 
because streamlined setup does not conﬁgure global router parameters. There are 
prompts only to conﬁgure interface parameters, which permit the router to boot. 
This allows the router to boot when it cannot ﬁnd a valid Cisco IOS Software 
image in Flash memory. The default prompt is the host name followed by 
<boot>.
Table 12-4 brieﬂy describes some of the commonly used conﬁguration commands.

Conﬁguring a Router Name
One of the ﬁrst basic conﬁguration tasks is to name the router, as shown in Example 12-2. 
Naming a router helps to better manage the network by uniquely identifying each 
router within the network. The router is named in global conﬁguration mode. The 
name of the router is called the host name and is displayed as the system prompt. If a 
router is not named, the system default is Router.

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Conﬁguring and Protecting Router Passwords 
A router can be secured to restrict access by using passwords. Passwords can be estab-
lished for virtual terminal lines and the console line. Privileged mode EXEC also can 
have a password.
From global conﬁguration mode, use the enable password command to restrict access 
to privileged mode. This password, however, will be visible from the router’s conﬁgu-
ration ﬁles. To enter an encrypted password in privileged mode, use the command 
enable secret. If an enable secret password is conﬁgured, it is used instead of the enable 
password. From the conﬁguration ﬁles, a person can view only the encryption, not the 
actual password.
Enable secret passwords cannot be read; another user might be able to break into the 
conﬁguration, but the only thing that can be done is to overwrite the password 
because it is one-way encrypted and cannot be converted back to clear text. 
Passwords can be further protected from display through the use of the service
password-encryption command. This command is entered from global conﬁguration 
mode.
The line console 0 conﬁguration mode can be used to establish a login password on the 
console terminal. This is useful on a network on which multiple people have access to 
the router. This prevents anyone not authorized from accessing the router. 
Telnet requires a password check. Different hardware platforms have different num-
bers of vty lines deﬁned. The range 0 through 4 is used to specify ﬁve vty lines. These 
ﬁve incoming Telnet sessions can be simultaneous. The same password can be used for

all lines, or one line can be set uniquely. This often is used in large networks with many 
network administrators. If a catastrophic problem occurs on a network and all com-
mon vty lines are used, the one unique line can be reserved for recovery.
Use the command line vty 0 4 to establish a login password on incoming Telnet 
sessions. Example 12-3 demonstrates the different ways to conﬁgure and protect 
passwords.
Examining the show Commands
Many show commands exist, which help examine the contents of ﬁles in the router 
and are useful in troubleshooting. From each mode in the router, the show ? command
can be used to see all the available options. Table 12-5 lists some of the show com-
mand options.
Example 12-3 Conﬁguring/Protecting Passwords
! Console Password
Router(config)# line console 0
Router(config-line)# login

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Conﬁguring a Serial Interface 
A serial interface can be conﬁgured from the console or through a virtual terminal line. 
Serial interfaces require a clock signal to control the timing of the communications. In 
most environments, a data communications equipment (DCE) device such as a channel 
service unit/data service unit (CSU/DSU) provides the clock. By default, Cisco routers 
are data terminal equipment (DTE) devices, but they can be conﬁgured as DCE devices.
On serial links that are directly interconnected, one side must be considered as a DCE 
and provide a clocking signal. The clock is enabled and its speed is speciﬁed with the 
clockrate command. The available clock rates in bits per second are 1200, 2400, 9600, 
19,200, 38,400, 56,000, 64,000, 72,000, 125,000, 148,000, 500,000, 800,000, 
1,000,000, 1,300,000, 2,000,000, and 4,000,000. However, some bit rates might not 
be available on certain serial interfaces depending on their capacity.
To conﬁgure a serial interface, perform the following steps and see Example 12-7:
Step 1
Enter global conﬁguration mode.
Step 2
Enter interface mode.

Configuring an Ethernet Interface
601
Step 4
Set the DCE clock rate (skip this step on DTE).
Step 5
Turn on the interface.
By default, interfaces are turned off. To turn on an interface, you must enter the com-
mand no shutdown. The interface might need to be administratively turned off to 
perform hardware maintenance, change the interface conﬁguration, perform trouble-
shooting, or perform other maintenance. The command shutdown turns off an interface.
The following command administratively turns off the interface:
Router(config-if)# shutdown
The following command turns on an interface that has been shut down:
Router(config-if)# no shutdown
The following command quits the current interface conﬁguration mode:
Router(config-if)# exit
Conﬁguring an Ethernet Interface 
An Ethernet interface can be conﬁgured from the console or a virtual terminal line. 
Each Ethernet interface must have an IP address and subnet mask.
To conﬁgure an Ethernet interface, perform the following steps and see Example 12-8:
Step 1
Enter global conﬁguration mode.
Step 2
Enter interface conﬁguration mode.
Step 3
Specify the interface address and subnet mask.
Step 4
Turn on the interface.
Example 12-7 Conﬁguring a Serial Interface
Router(config)# interface serial 1/0
Router(config-if)# bandwidth 56
Router(config-if)# clockrate 56000

Lab Activity
Conﬁguring a Serial Interface
In this lab, you conﬁgure a serial interface on two  routers so that they can

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
By default, interfaces are turned off. To turn on an interface, enter the command no
shutdown. The interface might need to be administratively turned off to perform hard-
ware maintenance, change the interface conﬁguration, perform troubleshooting, or 
perform other maintenance. The command shutdown turns off an interface.
Executing Changes to the Router 
If a change is needed to a conﬁguration, enter the appropriate mode and make the 
change. For example, if an interface was not turned on, enter global conﬁguration 
mode and then enter interface mode, and issue the command no shutdown.
To verify changes, use the show running-conﬁg command. This command displays the 
current conﬁguration. If the variables displayed are not what was intended, the envi-
ronment can be corrected by doing the following:
■Issuing the no form of a conﬁguration command 
■Restarting the system and reloading the original conﬁguration ﬁle from NVRAM
■Removing the startup conﬁguration ﬁle with the erase startup-conﬁguration 
command, restarting the router, and entering setup mode
To save the conﬁguration variables to the startup conﬁguration ﬁle in NVRAM, enter 
the following command at the privileged EXEC prompt:
Router# copy running-configuration startup-configuration

Finishing the Conﬁguration
The following lists recommended tasks for ﬁnishing the conﬁguration. (Some organi-
zations do not have some of the recommended conﬁguration tasks, such as a message-
of-the-day.)
■Establishing conﬁguration standards
■Providing and conﬁguring interface descriptions
■Conﬁguring login banners
■Conﬁguring a message-of-the-day (MOTD) banner
■Performing host name resolution
■Performing conﬁguration backup and documentation
Importance of Conﬁguration Standards
It is important to develop standards for conﬁguring ﬁles within an organization. This 
facilitates control of the number of conﬁguration ﬁles that must be maintained, how 
the ﬁles are stored, and where the ﬁles are stored. 
A standard is a set of rules or procedures that are either widely used or ofﬁcially speci-
ﬁed. Without standards in an organization, a network could be in chaos if an interrup-
tion in service occurs.

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
To manage a network, there must be a centralized support standard. Conﬁguration, 
security, performance, and other issues must be adequately addressed for the network 
to function smoothly. Creating standards for network consistency helps reduce net-
work complexity, the amount of unplanned downtime, and exposure to events that 
might have an impact on network performance.
Providing Interface Descriptions
An interface description should be used to identify important information such as a 
distant router, a circuit number, or a speciﬁc network segment. A description of an 
interface can help a network user remember speciﬁc information about the interface, 
such as what network the interface services. The next section, “Conﬁguring Interface 
Descriptions,” provides a speciﬁc example.
The description is meant solely as a comment about the interface. Although the descrip-
tion appears in the conﬁguration ﬁles that exist in router memory, a description does 
not affect the operation of the router. Descriptions are created by following a standard 
format that applies to each interface. The description can include the purpose and 
location of the interface, other devices or locations connected to the interface, and 
circuit identiﬁers. Descriptions enable support personnel to better understand the 
scope of problems related to an interface and allow for faster resolution of problems. 
Conﬁguring Interface Descriptions
Enter global conﬁguration mode to conﬁgure an interface description. Perform the 
following steps and see Example 12-9:
Step 1
Enter global conﬁguration mode by entering the command conﬁgure
terminal.
Step 2
Enter speciﬁc interface mode (for example, interface Ethernet 0) by enter-
ing the command interface ethernet 0.
Step 3
Enter the command description, followed by the information that is to be 
displayed (for example, XYZ Network, Building 10).
Step 4
Exit interface mode back to privileged EXEC mode by pressing Ctrl-z.
Step 5
Save the conﬁguration changes to NVRAM by using the command copy
running-conﬁg startup-conﬁg.

Login Banners
A login banner is a message that is displayed at login. The login banner is useful for 
conveying messages that affect all network users, such as notices of impending system 
shutdowns.
Anyone can see login banners. Therefore, careful attention should be used in the word-
ing of a banner message. “Welcome” is an invitation for anyone to enter a router and 
is probably not an appropriate message.
A login banner should be a warning not to attempt login unless authorized. A message 
such as, “This is a secure system, authorized access only!” instructs unwanted visitors 
that any further intrusion or attempt is unwanted and illegal. Example 12-10 shows an 
example of a login banner.

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Conﬁguring a Message of the Day
A message-of-the-day (MOTD) or login banner can be displayed on all connected 
terminals.
Enter global conﬁguration mode to conﬁgure a MOTD banner. Use the banner motd
command, followed by a space and a delimiting character, such as the pound sign (#). 
Add a message of the day followed by a space and the delimiting character again.
Perform the following steps to create and display a message of the day. See Example 12-11:
Step 1
Enter global conﬁguration mode by using the command conﬁgure
terminal.
Step 2
Enter the command banner motd # The message of the day goes here #.
Step 3
Save changes by issuing the command copy running-conﬁguration 
startup-conﬁguration, or copy run start for a shortcut.
Host Name Resolution
Host name resolution is the process that a computer system uses to associate a host 
name with a network address.
Protocols such as Telnet use host names to identify network devices. To use host names 
to communicate with other IP devices, network devices, such as routers, must be capable 
of associating the host names with IP addresses. A list of host names and their associ-
ated IP addresses is called a host table. Table 12-7 shows a sample host table.

Lab Activity
Conﬁguring Message-of-the-Day
In this lab, you use global conﬁguration mode to enter a message-of-the-day 
into the router. This procedure enables all users to view the message upon 
entering the router.

1102.book  Page 606  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Finishing the Configuration
607
A host table might include all devices in a network organization. Each unique IP 
address can have a host name associated with it. Cisco IOS Software maintains a cache 
of host name-to-address mappings for use by EXEC commands. This cache speeds up 
the process of converting names to addresses.
Host names, unlike Domain Name System (DNS) names, are signiﬁcant only on the 
router on which they are conﬁgured. Example 12-12 shows the conﬁguration of a host 
table on a router.
This host table enables the network administrator to type either the host name or the 
IP address to Telnet to a remote host. An example to use as the host name would be 
Auckland or 172.16.32.1 for the IP address. To display a list of hosts and their associ-
ated IP addresses that are deﬁned for a particular router, use the command show hosts.
Conﬁguration Backup and Documentation
The conﬁguration of network devices determines the way the network behaves or acts. 
Management of device conﬁguration includes the following tasks:
■Listing and comparing conﬁguration ﬁles on running devices
■Storing conﬁguration ﬁles on network servers
■Performing software installations and upgrades

Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Conﬁguration ﬁles should be stored as backup ﬁles in case a problem arises. Conﬁgu-
ration ﬁles can be stored on a network server, on a TFTP server, or on a disk stored in 
a safe place. Documentation should be included with this ofﬂine information. 
The conﬁguration on the router also can be saved to a disk by capturing text in the router 
and saving it to the disk or hard drive. If the ﬁle needs to be copied back to the router, it 
can be pasted into the router. These methods of saving and restoring the router conﬁgura-
tion are covered in greater detail in Chapter 14, “Managing Cisco IOS Software.”

Password Recovery
609
Password Recovery
This section explains several password-recovery techniques for Cisco routers and 
Catalyst switches. You can perform password recovery on most of the platforms 
without changing hardware jumpers, but all platforms require that the router be 
rebooted. Password recovery can be done only from the console port (physically 
attached to the router).
Overview of Password Recovery
Three ways exist for restoring access to a router when the password is lost. You can 
view the password, change the password, or erase the conﬁguration and start over as if 
the box was new.
Each procedure follows these basic steps:
Step 1
Conﬁgure the router to start up without reading the conﬁguration mem-
ory (NVRAM). This is done from what sometimes is called test system 
mode, ROM mode, or boot mode.
Step 2
Reboot the system.
Step 3
Access enable mode (which can be done without a password if you set 
the conﬁguration register correctly in Step 1).
Step 4
View or change the password, or erase the conﬁguration.
Step 5
Reconﬁgure the router to boot up and read the NVRAM as it normally 
does.
Step 6
Reboot the system.
Some password recovery requires a terminal to issue a BREAK signal; you must be 
familiar with how your terminal or PC terminal emulator issues this signal. In Pro-
Comm, for example, the keys Alt-B generate the BREAK signal by default; in Windows 
HyperTerminal, you press Break or Ctrl-Break. Windows HyperTerminal also enables 
you to deﬁne a function key as BREAK. From the terminal window, select Function 
Keys and deﬁne one as Break by ﬁlling in the characters ^$B (Shift-6, Shift-4, and 
uppercase B). Several free terminal-emulation packages also are available for down-
load on the Internet, which you might ﬁnd preferable.
The following sections contain detailed instructions for speciﬁc Cisco routers. Locate 
your product at the beginning of each section to determine which technique to use.
1102.book  Page 609  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

610
Chapter 12: Router Configuration
Password Recovery Technique 1
The following are the relevant devices for this technique: 
■Cisco 2500 series
■Cisco 3000 series
■Cisco 7000 series running Cisco IOS Software Release 10.0 or later in ROMs
This technique can be used on the Cisco 7000 and Cisco 7010 series only if the router 
has Cisco IOS Software Release 10.0 ROMs installed on the Route Processor (RP) 
card. It might be booting Flash Cisco IOS Software Release 10.0, but it needs the 
actual ROMs on the processor card as well. The following steps outline password 
recovery technique 1:
Step 1
Attach a terminal or PC with terminal emulation to the console port of 
the router. To connect a PC to the console port, attach a null modem 
adapter (Tandy Null Modem Adapter No. 26-1496 has been tested) to 
the console port, and then attach a straight-through modem cable to the 
null modem adapter.
Step 2
Type show version and record the setting of the conﬁguration register. It 
is usually 0x2102 or 0x102. If you do not get the router prompt to do a 
show version, look on a similar router to obtain the conﬁguration regis-
ter number, or try using 0x2102.
Step 3
Power-cycle the router.
Step 4
Press the Break key on the terminal within 60 seconds of the power-up. 
You should see the > prompt with no router name. If you don’t see this, 
the terminal is not sending the correct BREAK signal. In that case, check 
the terminal or terminal emulation setup.
Step 5
Type o/r 0x42 at the > prompt to boot from Flash memory, or type o/r
0x41 to boot from the boot ROMs. (Note that this is the letter o, not the 
numeral zero.) If you have Flash memory and it is intact, 0x42 is the best 
setting because it is the default. Use 0x41 only if the Flash memory is 
erased or is not installed. If you use 0x41, you can either view or erase 
the conﬁguration. You cannot change the password.
Step 6
Type i at the > prompt. The router reboots but ignores its saved conﬁgu-
ration.
Step 7
Answer no to all the setup questions, or press Ctrl-C.
Step 8
Type enable at the Router> prompt. You’re then in enable mode and can 
see the Router# prompt.

611
Step 9
Choose one of the following three options:
■To view the password, type show start.
■To change the password (in case it is encrypted, for example), do 
the following:
a. Type copy start run to copy the NVRAM into memory.
b. Type show run.
c. If you have the enable secret password set, perform the following:
Type conﬁg term and make the changes.
Type enable secret new_password.
Press Ctrl-Z.
d. If you do not have enable secret xxxx, type enable password 
new_password and press Ctrl-Z.
e. Type copy run start to commit the changes.
■To erase the conﬁg, type erase start.
Step 10 Type conﬁg term at the prompt.
Step 11 Type conﬁg-register 0x2102, or whatever value you recorded in Step 2.
Step 12 Press Ctrl-Z to return to privileged EXEC mode.
Step 13 Type reload at the prompt. You do not need to write memory.
Password Recovery Technique 2
Use this procedure to recover lost passwords on the following routers:
■Cisco 1003
■Cisco 1600 series
■Cisco 2600 series
■Cisco 3600 series
■Cisco 4500 series
■Cisco 7100 series
■Cisco 7200 series
■Cisco 7500 series
■IDT Orion-based routers
■AS5200 and AS5300 platforms

612
Chapter 12: Router Configuration
To recover a password using procedure 2, perform the following steps:
Step 1
Attach a terminal or PC with terminal-emulation software to the console 
port of the router.
Step 2
Enter show version and record the setting of the conﬁguration register. 
It is usually 0x2102 or 0x102.
The conﬁguration register value is on the last line of the display. Note 
whether the conﬁguration register is set to enable Break or disable Break.
The factory-default conﬁguration register value is 0x2102. Notice that 
the third digit from the left in this value is 1, which disables Break. If the 
third digit is not 1, Break is enabled.
Step 3
Turn off the router and then turn it on again.
Step 4
Press the Break key on the terminal within 60 seconds of turning on the 
router. The rommon> prompt appears. If it does not appear, the terminal 
is not sending the correct Break signal.
If the prompt does not appear, check the terminal or terminal emulation 
setup.
Step 5
Enter confreg at the rommon> prompt.
The following prompt appears:
Do you wish to change configuration [y/n]?
Step 6
Enter yes and press Return.
Step 7
Enter no to subsequent questions until the following prompt appears:
ignore system config info [y/n]?
Step 8
Enter yes.
Step 9
Enter no to subsequent questions until the following prompt appears:
change boot characteristics [y/n]?
Step 10 Enter yes.
The following prompt appears:
enter to boot:
Step 11 At this prompt, either enter 2 and press Enter if booting from Flash mem-
ory, or, if Flash memory is erased, enter 1.
If Flash memory is erased, the Cisco 4500 must be returned to Cisco for 
service. If you enter 1, you can only view or erase the conﬁguration; you 
cannot change the password.

Step 13 Enter reset at the privileged EXEC prompt or, for Cisco 4500 series and 
Cisco 7500 series routers, power-cycle the router.
Step 14 As the router boots, enter no to all the setup questions until the following 
prompt appears:
Router>
Step 15 Enter enable to enter enable mode.
The Router# prompt appears.
Step 16 Choose one of the following options:
■To view the password, if it is not encrypted, enter 
more nvram:startup-conﬁg.
■To change the password (if it is encrypted, for example), enter the 
following commands:
Router# configure memory
Router# configure terminal
Router(config)# enable secret 1234abcd
Router(config)# ctrl-z
Router# write memory
The enable secret command provides increased security by storing 
the enable secret password using a nonreversible cryptographic 
function; however, you cannot recover a lost password that has 
been encrypted.
Step 17 Enter conﬁgure terminal at the prompt.
Step 18 Type conﬁg-register and whatever value you recorded in Step 2.
Step 19 Press Ctrl-Z to quit the conﬁguration editor.
Step 20 Enter reload at the prompt and enter write memory to save the 
conﬁguration.

Summary
This chapter summarized the key points in conﬁguring a router:
■The router has several modes:
— User mode
— Privileged mode
— Global conﬁguration mode
— Other conﬁguration modes
■The command-line interface (CLI) is used to change conﬁgurations, including 
doing the following:
— Setting the host name
— Setting passwords
— Conﬁguring interfaces
— Modifying conﬁgurations
— Showing conﬁgurations
■Interface descriptions include important information to help network adminis-
trators understand and troubleshoot their networks.
■Login banners and messages of the day provide users with information upon 
login to the router. 
■Host name resolutions translate names to IP addresses to allow the router to 
quickly convert names to addresses.
■Three ways exist for restoring access to a router when the password is lost:
— You can view the password.
— You can change the password.
— You can erase the conﬁguration and start over as if the box was new.
■Conﬁguration standards are key elements in the success of any organization in 
maintaining an efﬁcient network. Conﬁguration backup and documentation is 
extremely important to keep a network operating smoothly.

Chapter 13
Learning About Neighboring 
and Remote Devices
In this chapter, you learn how to implement, monitor, and maintain Cisco Discovery 
Protocol by using the correct router commands. In addition, this chapter explains the 
commands most often used to perform address-related troubleshooting.
Please be sure to look at the e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms associated with this chapter 
that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concents introduced in this chapter.
Introduction to CDP
Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a Layer 2 protocol that connects lower physical media 
and upper network layer protocols, as shown in Figure 13-1. CDP is used to obtain infor-
mation about neighboring devices. This information shows the types of devices connected, 
the router interfaces they are connected to, the interfaces used to make the connections, 
and the model numbers of the devices. CDP is media and protocol independent, and runs 
on all Cisco equipment, over the Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP). CDP is a propri-
etary protocol native to Cisco networking devices and will run only on Cisco networking 
devices.
CDP Version 2 (CDPv2) is the most recent release of the protocol. Cisco IOS Software 
Release 12.0(3)T version or later supports CDPv2. CDP Version 1 (CDPv1) is enabled 
globally by default with Cisco IOS Software Release 10.3 or later.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
Figure 13-1 Where CDP Fits In
When a Cisco device boots up, CDP starts up automatically and allows the device to 
detect neighboring devices that are also running CDP. CDP runs over the data link 
layer and allows two systems to learn about each other, even if they are using different 
network layer protocols.
Each device conﬁgured for CDP sends periodic messages, known as advertisements, to 
multiple routers. Each device advertises at least one address at which it can receive 
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) messages. The advertisements also 
contain Time-To-Live (TTL) or holdtime information. This holdtime information indi-
cates the length of time that receiving devices hold CDP information before discarding 
it. Additionally, each device listens to periodic CDP messages sent by others to learn 
about neighboring devices.
Obtaining Information with CDP
The primary use of CDP is to discover all Cisco devices that are directly connected to a 
local device. A CDP frame can be small, yet can retrieve many useful information 
about neighboring routers and switches. Use the command show cdp entry [device
name], as demonstrated in Example 13-1, to display a single cached CDP entry.

Notice that the output from this command includes all the Layer 3 addresses present 
in the neighbor router, Router B. An administrator can view the IP addresses of the 
targeted CDP neighbor (Router B) with the single command entry on Router A. The 
holdtime value indicates the amount of elapsed time since the CDP frame arrived with 
this information. The show cdp entry [device name] command includes abbreviated 
version information about Router B. Knowing the version of neighboring devices 
provides you with an idea of the exact physical topology of the network to properly 
conﬁgure the devices.
Showing CDP Neighbors
Figure 13-2 displays an example of how CDP delivers its collection of information to a 
network administrator. Each router that is running CDP exchanges protocol informa-
tion with its neighbors. The network administrator displays the results of this CDP 
information exchange on a console that is connected to a local router.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
You use the show cdp neighbors command to display information about the networks 
directly connected to the router. CDP provides information about each CDP neighbor 
device by transmitting Type Length Values (TLVs). TLVs are blocks of information 
embedded in CDP advertisements.
Device TLVs displayed by the show cdp neighbors command, and as shown in 
Example 13-2, include the following:
■Device ID
■Local Interface
■Holdtime
■Capability
■Platform
■Port ID
■VTP Management Domain Name (CDPv2 only)
■Native VLAN (CDPv2 only)
■Full/Half-Duplex (CDPv2 only)
To display all the information output generated by show cdp neighbors, as well as 
information like that from show cdp entry, you use the optional show cdp neighbors 
detail command, as demonstrated in Example 13-3.

Notice that the lowest router in Figure 13-2 is not directly connected to the adminis-
trator’s console router. To obtain CDP information about this device, the administrator 
needs to Telnet to a router that is directly connected to this device. As previously 
stated, you will ﬁnd this information helps you gain full knowledge about the devices 
that are on the network, which provides you a better understanding of the physical 
topology.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
Use the cdp run command to enable CDP globally on the router. By default, CDP is 
globally enabled. Use the cdp enable command to enable CDP on a particular inter-
face. On Cisco IOS Software Release 10.3 and later, CDP could be enabled on each 
interface of the device by using the cdp enable command. Even though CDP is enabled 
by default on most Cisco devices, you might encounter instances in which you need to 
manually enable CDP on a per interface basis. Examples of when this manual enabling 
might need to be done occur on 1900 series switches that do not support using the cdp
run command. On 1900 series switches, you need to enable or disable CDP on a per 
interface basis. Other examples include particular interfaces thatmight not have CDP 
enabled for security purposes.
Use the show cdp interface command to gather information that CDP uses for its 
advertisement and discovery frame transmission. Example 13-4 demonstrates some 
sample output from this command. This information helps provide detailed informa-
tion about such things as the holdtime, the frequency at which CDP packets are sent, 
the encapsulation time for the interface, and the administrative and protocol condi-
tions of the interface.

Introduction to CDP
627
Creating a Network Map of the Environment
CDP was designed and implemented as a simple, low-overhead protocol. Though a 
CDP frame can be very small, CDP can retrieve a great deal of useful information 
about connected neighboring routers.
The show cdp neighbors command can be used to obtain the following information:
■Device ID
■Address
■Port ID
■Capabilities
■Version
■Platform
■IP Network Preﬁx
■VTP Management Domain Name (CDPv2 only)
■Native VLAN (CDPv2 only)
■Full/Half-Duplex (CDPv2 only)
This information can be used to create a network map of the connected devices. Devices 
connected to neighboring devices can be discovered by using Telnet to connect to the 
neighbors. Use the show cdp neighbors detail command to discover what devices are 
connected to those neighbors.
Disabling and Troubleshooting CDP
As previously mentioned, CDP is globally enabled on the router by default. To disable
CDP at the global level, use the no cdp run command in global conﬁg mode. If CDP 
is disabled globally, the interface cannot be enabled for CDP. For example, you might 
disable CDP for security purposes when you do not want information made available 
about a particular device.
Example 13-4 show cdp interface Command Output
routerA# show cdp interface
Serial 0 is up, line protocol is up, encapsulation is Frame Relay
  Sending CDP packets every 60 seconds
  Holdtime is 180 seconds
Ethernet0 is up, line protocol is up, encapsulation is ARPA
  Sending CDP packets every 60 seconds
  Holdtime is 180 seconds

628
Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
On Cisco IOS Software Release 10.3 and later, CDP is disabled by default on each of 
interface of the device. You must use the cdp enable command before CDP is enabled 
and CDP messages can be sent and received. To disable CDP on a speciﬁc interface 
after it has been enabled, use the no cdp enable command in interface conﬁg mode.
Table 13-2 lists and describes troubleshooting commands that you can use to show the 
version, update information, tables, and trafﬁc.

Getting Information About Remote Devices
This section describes Telnet, ping, and traceroute, which can be used to obtain infor-
mation about remote devices, as shown in Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-3 Testing Process Overview
Telnet
Telnet is a virtual terminal protocol that is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Telnet 
enables you to make connections to remote hosts and makes it possible for a network 
terminal to remotely log in. telnet is a Cisco IOS Software EXEC command used to 
verify the application layer software between source and destination. This command is 
the most complete test mechanism available.
Telnet performs at the application layer of the OSI model, and it depends on TCP to 
guarantee the correct and orderly delivery of data between the client and server.
A router can have simultaneous incoming Telnet sessions. The range 0 through 4 spec-
iﬁes ﬁve vty or Telnet lines. These ﬁve incoming Telnet sessions can take place at one 
time.
Verifying the application layer connectivity is a byproduct of Telnet. Telnet is mainly 
used to connect to remote network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers, to 
gather information or perform maintenance. It is a simple and universal application 
program.
Establishing and Verifying a Telnet Connection
The telnet Cisco IOS Software EXEC command allows a user to Telnet from one Cisco 
device to another. With the Cisco implementation of TCP/IP, you do not have to enter 
the command connect or telnet to establish a Telnet connection. Just enter the host name 
or the IP address of the remote router. To end a Telnet session, use the EXEC commands 
exit or logout. Figure 13-4 demonstrates initiating and exiting a Telnet connection.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
Figure 13-4 Telnet Operation
A host name table or access to DNS for Telnet must be present for a name to work in 
a Telnet session; otherwise, the IP address of the host must be entered. To initiate a 
Telnet session, use any of the following alternatives:
Denver>connect paris 
Denver>paris 
Denver>131.108.100.152 
Denver>telnet paris
You can use Telnet to perform a test to determine whether access can or cannot be 
obtained from a remote router. As shown in Figure 13-5, if Telnet is successful in con-
necting the York router to the Paris router, a basic test of the network connection is 
successful. This operation can be performed at either the user or privileged EXEC levels.
Figure 13-5 Testing the Application Layer
If remote access can be obtained through another router, at least one TCP/IP applica-
tion can reach the remote router. A successful Telnet connection indicates that the 
upper-layer application functions properly.
A successful Telnet can occur to one router, but fail to another router. Speciﬁc addressing, 
naming, or access permission problems are likely culprits for Telnet failure. Further, it is

possible that the problem exists on the source router or on the router that failed as a 
Telnet target. In this case, the next step is to try ping, which is covered later in this 
chapter. ping allows testing of end-to-end connections at the network layer.
Once the Telnet is completed, log off the host. The EXEC terminates any connection 
after ten minutes of inactivity by default or when you enter the exit command at the 
EXEC prompt.
Advanced Telnet Operation
You might have several concurrent Telnet sessions open, and you can switch back and 
forth between these sessions. The number of open sessions that are allowed at one time 
is deﬁned by the session limit command.
To switch between sessions by escaping from one session and resuming a previous 
opened session, use the following commands:
■Ctrl + Shift + 6 followed by hitting the letter x—Escapes the current connection 
and returns to the EXEC prompt
■resume—Makes the connection
You can make a new connection while at the EXEC prompt. Most routers are limited 
to ﬁve simultaneous sessions.
You can use and suspend multiple Telnet sessions with the Ctrl + Shift + 6 followed by 
hitting the letter x sequence. The session can be resumed by using the Enter key. If the 
Enter key is used, Cisco IOS Software resumes the connection to the most recently sus-
pended Telnet connection. Using the resume command requires a connection ID, and 
you can display the connection IDs for all open sessions by using the show sessions
command.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
Alternative Connectivity Tests
The following sections cover many of the commands that can be used to test and 
examine connectivity between devices. The tools and commands described in this 
section are as follows:
■ping
■traceroute
■show ip route
■show interfaces serial
■show interfaces/clear counter
■debug
The ping Command
Many network protocols support an echo protocol as an aid to diagnosing basic net-
work connectivity. Echo protocols test whether or not protocol packets are being 
routed.
The ping command sends a packet to the destination host and then waits for a reply 
packet from that host. Results from this echo protocol can help evaluate the path-to-
host reliability, delays over the path, and if the host can be reached or is functioning. 
This command is a basic testing mechanism, and its operation can be performed in 
either the user or privileged EXEC modes.
The ping user EXEC command can be used to diagnose basic network connectivity. 
Use the ping command as follows:
1. ping IP address or name of destination.
2. Press the Enter key.
Table 13-3 shows the Cisco ping return codes. ping uses Internet Control Message 
Protocol (ICMP).
Lab Activity
Advanced Telnet Operation
In this activity, you use the telnet command to remotely access other routers, 
verifying that the application layer between source and destination is working 
properly. You suspend a Telnet session and engage in multiple Telnet sessions. 
You return to the suspended session and disconnect from the Telnet session.

The exclamation points (!) indicate each successful echo. If one or more periods (.) are 
received instead of exclamations on the display, the application on the router timed 
out waiting for a given packet echo from the ping target.
The traceroute Command
The traceroute command (abbreviated as trace) is the ideal tool for ﬁnding where data 
is being sent in a network. The traceroute command is similar to the ping command,
except that instead of testing end-to-end connectivity, traceroute tests each step along 
the way. This operation can be performed at either the user or privileged EXEC levels.
Use the traceroute command as follows:
1. traceroute IP address or name of destination.
2. Press the Enter key.
Table 13-4 shows the Cisco traceroute return codes.

In this activity, you use the ping command to send ICMP datagrams to a target 
host and verify that the network layer between source and destination is work-
ing properly. You retrieve information to evaluate the path-to-host reliability, 
determine delays over the path, and determine if the host can be reached or is 
functioning.

traceroute command will continue attempting to reach the next step until the Ctrl-
Shift-6 escape sequence is used.
The traceroute command takes advantage of the error messages generated by routers 
when a packet exceeds its TTL or hop count value. The traceroute command sends 
several ping packets with an incrementing TTL value and displays the round-trip time 
for each. Because the TTL value is incremented each time a ping is sent, each succes-
sive ping gets closer to the destination. The beneﬁt of the traceroute command is that it 
also tells which router in the path was the last one to be reached, which allows for 
fault isolation.
Testing the Network Layer with the show ip route Command
The router offers some powerful tools at this point in the search. You can actually look 
at the routing table, which contains directions that the router uses to determine how it 
will direct trafﬁc across the network, and use another basic test that focuses on the net-
work layer. Use the show ip route command as demonstrated in Example 13-5 to 
determine whether a routing table entry exists for the target network. The output in 
Example 13-5 shows that Rome (131.108.33.0) is reachable by Paris (131.108.16.2) 
via the Ethernet1 interface.

Testing the Physical and Data Link Layers with the show interfaces 
serial Command
Figure 13-8 shows a serial connection between two router interfaces. The interface has 
two pieces, physical (hardware) and logical (software):
■The hardware (including cables, connectors, and interfaces) must make the 
actual connection between the devices.
■The software is responsible for the messages, such as keepalive messages, control 
information, and user information, that are passed between adjacent devices. 
This data is being passed between the two connected router interfaces.
Figure 13-8 Testing the Physical and Data Link Layers
When you test the physical and data link layers, ask these questions:
■Is there a carrier detect signal?
■Is the physical link between devices good?
■Are the keepalive messages being received?
■Can data packets be sent across the physical link?
One of the most important elements of the show interfaces serial command output is 
the display of the line and data link protocol status. Figure 13-9 indicates the key sum-
mary line used to check the status of the line and the data link protocol.
Lab Activity
Alternate Connectivity Tests (traceroute and show ip route)
In this activity, you use the traceroute Cisco IOS Software command to verify 
that the network layer between source, destination, and each router along the 
way is working properly. The tracert Windows OS command is used from 
source workstation to destination router. You also use the show ip route
command to display the router’s routing table.

Figure 13-9 Identifying Line and Protocol Problems
The line status in this example is triggered by a carrier detect signal and refers to the 
physical layer status. However, the line protocol, triggered by keepalive frames, refers 
to data link framing (a Layer 2 function).
Using the show interfaces and clear counters Commands
The router tracks statistics that provide information about the interfaces. Use the show
interfaces command to display the statistics, as demonstrated in Example 13-6.
Example 13-6 show interfaces Command Output

The statistics reﬂect router operation since the last time the counters were cleared. Use 
the clear counters command to reset the counters to 0. By starting from 0, you get a 
better picture of the current status of the network. The show interfaces command can 
also be used to check the status of other interface types, such as Ethernet (E0), Fast 
Ethernet (Fa0), and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) (BRI0).
Checking Real-Time Trafﬁc with the debug Command
The router includes hardware and software to aid it in tracking down problems on it 
or on other hosts in the network. The debug privileged EXEC command starts the con-
sole display of the network events speciﬁed in the command parameter. Use the termi-
nal monitor command to forward debug output to your Telnet session terminal.
Figure 13-10 displays the data-link broadcasts received by the router using the debug
broadcasts command. Use the undebug all (or no debug all) command to turn off 
debugging when you no longer need it. Debugging is really intended for solving 
problems.
Figure 13-10 Checking Real-Time Trafﬁc with the debug Command
By default, the router sends system error messages and output from the debug EXEC
command to the console terminal. However, you can redirect messages to a UNIX host 
or to an internal buffer. The terminal monitor command enables you to redirect these 
messages to a terminal, which can be useful in cases where you use a UNIX or Linux 
host instead of the console terminal as a means of administering the devices.
    22146 packets output, 2383680 bytes, 0 underruns
    0 output errors, 0 collisions, 2 interface resets, 0 restarts

CAUTION
Be careful with the 
debug command on a 
live network. Substan-
tial debugging on a 
busy network slows 
the network signiﬁ-
cantly. Do not leave 
debugging turned on; 
use it to diagnose a 
problem, and then 
turn it off. Excessive 
debugging on routers 
with minimal RAM 
can cause the router 
to force a reload.

Chapter 13: Learning About Neighboring and Remote Devices
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following the key points:
■CDP is a media- and protocol-independent, Cisco-proprietary protocol used for 
neighbor discovery.
■CDP shows information only about directly connected neighbors.
■You use CDP to show Layer 2 and 3 information about neighbors.
■You should test network connectivity layer by layer.
■Dealing with connectivity issues is the most common problem situation that 
occurs on IP networks. The following three commands are used to perform 
address-related troubleshooting:
— ping uses the ICMP protocol to verify the hardware connection and the 
IP address of the network layer. This command is a very basic testing 
mechanism.
— telnet veriﬁes the application layer software between source and destina-
tion. This command is the most complete test mechanism available.
— traceroute allows the location of failures in the path from the source to des-
tination. traceroute, or trace, uses TTL values to generate messages from 
each router along the path.
To supplement all that you’ve learned in this chapter, refer to the chapter-speciﬁc Videos, 
PhotoZooms, and e-Lab Activities on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.

Key Terms
CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
 Used to obtain information about neighboring 
devices, such as the types of devices connected, the router interfaces they are connected 
to, the interfaces used to make the connections, and the model numbers of the devices.
debugging
To ﬁnd and remove errors (bugs) from a program or design.
ping
Packet internet groper. ICMP echo message and its reply. Often used in IP 
networks to test the reachability of a network device.
SNAP (Subnetwork Access Protocol)
Internet protocol that operates between a 
network entity in the subnetwork and a network entity in the end system. SNAP 
speciﬁes a standard method of encapsulating IP datagrams and ARP messages on IEEE 
networks. The SNAP entity in the end system makes use of the services of the subnet-
work and performs three key functions: data transfer, connection management, and 
QoS selection.
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
Network management protocol 
used almost exclusively in TCP/IP networks. SNMP provides a means to monitor and 
control network devices, and to manage conﬁgurations, statistics collection, perfor-
mance, and security.
Telnet
Standard terminal emulation protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Telnet is 
used for remote terminal connection, enabling users to log in to remote systems and 
use resources as if they were connected to a local system.
TLVs (Type Length Values)
Blocks of information embedded in CDP advertisements.
traceroute
Program available on many systems that traces the path a packet takes to 
a destination. It is used mostly to debug routing problems between hosts.

Chapter 14
Managing Cisco IOS Software
This chapter examines the stages of the router boot sequence, including how the Cisco 
router locates and loads Cisco IOS Software. This chapter also introduces the boot system 
command and explains how the boot system command tells the router to boot up. Also, 
you learn how to use a variety of Cisco IOS Software source options and execute commands 
to load Cisco IOS Software onto the router, maintain backup ﬁles, and upgrade Cisco 
IOS Software. In addition, you learn about the functions of the conﬁguration register and 
how to determine which version of the Cisco IOS Software image ﬁle you have. Finally, 
this chapter describes how to use a TFTP server as a software source for the Cisco IOS 
Software image and conﬁguration ﬁles.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that 
you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed 
to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Stages of the Router Power-On/Boot Sequence
A router initializes by loading the bootstrap, the operating system, and a conﬁguration 
ﬁle. If the router cannot ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle, then it enters setup mode. The router 
stores a backup copy of the new conﬁguration from setup mode in nonvolatile random-
access memory (NVRAM). Figure 14-1 shows the events that occur as the router initializes.
1102.book  Page 645  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

646
Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
Figure 14-1 Router Startup Sequence
The goal of the startup routines for Cisco IOS Software is to start the router opera-
tions. The router must deliver reliable performance in connecting to the user networks 
it was conﬁgured to serve. To do this, the startup routines must do the following:
1. Make sure that the router loads ROM.
2. Find and load the Cisco IOS Software image that the router uses for its operating 
system.
3. Find and apply conﬁguration statements, including protocol functions and inter-
face addresses.
When a Cisco router powers up, it performs a power-on self test (POST). During this 
self test, the router executes diagnostics from ROM on all hardware modules. These 
diagnostics verify the basic operation of the CPU, memory, and network interface ports. 
After verifying the hardware functions, the router proceeds with software initialization.
Locating and Loading Cisco IOS Software
The default source for Cisco IOS Software startup depends on the hardware platform. 
However, the router usually looks to the boot system commands saved in NVRAM. 
Cisco IOS Software does, however, allow you to use several alternatives. You can spec-
ify that the router look at other sources for software. Also, the router can use its own 
fallback sequence, as necessary, to load the software. Figure 14-2 illustrates how the 
Cisco IOS Software image is located.

Locating and Loading Cisco IOS Software
647
Figure 14-2 Locating Cisco IOS Software
The settings in the conﬁguration register enable the following alternatives:
■You can specify global conﬁguration mode boot system commands to enter fall-
back sources for the router to use in sequence. When the router restarts, it uses 
these commands in sequence as needed.
■If NVRAM does not have boot system commands that the router can use, the 
system uses the Cisco IOS Software in Flash memory by default.
■If Flash memory is empty, the router next attempts to use Trivial File Transfer 
Protocol (TFTP) to load a Cisco IOS Software image from the network. The 
router uses the conﬁguration register value to form a ﬁlename from which to 
boot a default system image stored on a network server.
■If a TFTP server is unavailable, the router will load the limited version Cisco IOS 
Software image stored in ROM.
Using the boot system Command
You can enter multiple boot system commands to specify the fallback sequence for 
booting Cisco IOS Software. Examples 14-1, 14-2, and 14-3 show boot system entries
that specify that a Cisco IOS Software image will load ﬁrst from Flash memory, then 
from a network server, and ﬁnally from ROM.

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
The command copy running-conﬁg startup-conﬁg saves the commands in NVRAM. 
The router executes the boot system commands as needed and in the order in which 
they were originally entered into conﬁguration mode. To see if any boot system com-
mands have been entered, issue the show startup-conﬁg command.
Booting from Flash Memory
Booting from Flash memory involves loading a system image from electrically erasable 
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). The advantage here is that information 
stored in Flash memory is not vulnerable to network failures that can occur when load-
ing system images from TFTP servers. Example 14-1 speciﬁes that the gsnew-image
Cisco IOS Software ﬁle be loaded from Flash.
Booting from a Network Server
In case Flash memory becomes corrupted, a system image can provide a backup by 
specifying that it should be loaded from a TFTP server. Example 14-2 speciﬁes that the 
test.ext image ﬁle be loaded from the TFTP server at IP address 172.16.13.111.
Booting from ROM
If Flash memory is corrupted and the network server fails to load the image, booting 
from ROM is the ﬁnal bootstrap option in software. However, the system image in 
ROM will likely be a subset of Cisco IOS Software. This subset lacks the protocols, 
features, and conﬁgurations of full Cisco IOS Software. Also, if the software has been 
updated since the router was purchased, the router might have an older version of 
Cisco IOS Software. Example 14-3 demonstrates this last bootstrap option.
Example 14-1 Booting from Flash Memory
Router# configure terminal
Router#(config)# boot system flash gsnew-image
[Ctrl-Z]
Router# copy running-config startup-config
Example 14-2 Booting from a Network Server
Router# configure terminal
Router#(config)# boot system tftp  IOS_image  172.16.13.111
[Ctrl-Z]
Router# copy running-config startup-config

Locating and Loading Cisco IOS Software
649
Conﬁguration Register Values
The order in which the router looks for Cisco IOS Software images to load depends on 
the boot ﬁeld setting in the conﬁguration register. You can change the default conﬁgu-
ration register setting with the global conﬁguration command conﬁg-register. Use a 
hexadecimal number as the argument for this command, as shown in Example 14-4.
The conﬁguration register is set so that the router examines the startup ﬁle in NVRAM 
for boot system options. The conﬁguration register is a 16-bit register in NVRAM. The 
lowest 4 bits of the conﬁguration register (bits 3, 2, 1, and 0) form the boot ﬁeld. To 
change the boot ﬁeld and leave all other bits set at their original values, follow these 
guidelines:
■Set the conﬁguration register value to 0x100 if the ROM monitor needs to be 
entered. This setting is primarily a programmer’s environment. Boot the operat-
ing system manually from the ROM monitor. Use the b command at the ROM 
monitor prompt to boot the system. This value sets the boot ﬁeld bits to 0-0-0-0.
■Set the conﬁguration register to 0x101 to conﬁgure the system to boot automati-
cally from the limited Cisco IOS Software image in ROM. This value sets the 
boot ﬁeld bits to 0-0-0-1.
Example 14-3 Booting from ROM
Router# configure terminal
Router#(config)# boot system rom
[Ctrl-Z]
Router# copy running-config startup-config

Using the boot system Command
In this activity, you gather information about the Cisco IOS Image and deter-
mine its boot source. You also check the conﬁg register settings and document 
a fallback boot sequence.

Router(config)# config-register 0x10F
[Ctrl – Z]

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
 
■Set the conﬁguration register to any value from 0x102 to 0x10F to conﬁgure the 
system to use the boot system commands in NVRAM. This setting is the default. 
These values set the boot ﬁeld bits to 0-0-1-0 through 1-1-1-1.
If there are no boot system commands in NVRAM, the system will typically look to 
Flash memory for the Cisco IOS Software image.
Table 14-1 shows the boot ﬁeld values in the conﬁguration register.
To check the boot ﬁeld setting and to verify the conﬁg-register command, use the show
version command.
Displaying the Currently Running Cisco IOS Software Version
The show version command, as shown in Example 14-5, displays information about 
the Cisco IOS Software version that is currently running on the router. This version 
information includes the conﬁguration register and the boot ﬁeld setting.
Table 14-1 Boot Field Values in the Conﬁguration Register

Description
0x100

Managing Cisco IOS Software Images
Routers and switches depend on software for their operation. The two types of software 
required are operating systems and conﬁguration.
The operating system used in almost all Cisco devices is the Cisco Internetwork 
Operating System (IOS). Cisco IOS Software allows the hardware to function as a 
router or switch. The Cisco IOS Software ﬁle is several megabytes in size. Cisco IOS 
Software is the platform that ensures that the network provides the connectivity, reli-
ability, security, quality of service, scalability, and management capabilities required 
for applications.

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
The software a router or switch uses is referred to as the conﬁguration ﬁle or the conﬁg.
The conﬁguration ﬁle contains the instructions that deﬁne how the device is to route 
or switch. A network administrator creates a conﬁguration ﬁle that deﬁnes the desired 
functions of the Cisco device. Examples of the functions that can be speciﬁed by the 
conﬁg are the IP addresses of the interfaces, routing protocols, and networks to be 
advertised. The conﬁguration ﬁle typically is a few hundred to a few thousand bytes 
in size.
Each of the software components is stored in memory as a separate ﬁle. These ﬁles are 
also stored in different types of memory.
The Cisco IOS Software image is stored in a memory area called Flash. Flash memory 
provides nonvolatile storage of a Cisco IOS Software image that can be used as an 
operating system at startup. Flash allows you to upgrade Cisco IOS Software or to 
store multiple Cisco IOS Software ﬁles. In many router architectures, the Cisco IOS 
Software image is copied from Flash and run from random-access memory (RAM).
A copy of the conﬁguration ﬁle is stored in NVRAM to be used as a conﬁguration 
during startup. This NVRAM conﬁguration is referred to as the startup conﬁg. The 
startup conﬁg is copied into RAM at boot time. This conﬁguration in RAM is the 
conﬁguration used to operate the router. The RAM conﬁguration is referred to as the 
running conﬁg.
A single interface to all the ﬁle systems that a router uses is provided in Software 
Release 12 of Cisco IOS Software. This version is referred to as the Cisco IOS File 
System (IFS). The IFS provides a single method to perform all the ﬁle system manage-
ment that a router uses. This IFS includes the Flash memory ﬁle systems, the network 
ﬁle systems, and reading or writing data. The network ﬁle systems include TFTP, remote
copy protocol (RCP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP). The reading or writing data 
includes NVRAM, the running conﬁguration, and ROM. The IFS uses a common set 
of preﬁxes to specify ﬁle system devices. Table 14-2 provides an overview of the IFS.
Table 14-2 IOS File System

platforms. For platforms that do not have a 
device named Flash, the preﬁx ﬂash: is aliased 
to slot0:. Therefore, the preﬁx ﬂash: can be 
used to refer to the main Flash memory stor-
age area on all platforms.

The IFS uses the Universal Resource Locator (URL) convention to specify ﬁles on 
network devices and the network. The URL convention identiﬁes the location of the 
conﬁguration ﬁles following the colon as [[[//location]/directory]/ﬁlename]. The IFS 
also supports FTP ﬁle transfer. Table 14-3 lists the commands used to manage Cisco 
IOS Software for Software Release 12.0 and compares them against counterpart com-
mands used in Cisco IOS Software releases prior to 12.0.

Cisco IOS Software Naming Conventions
Cisco develops many different versions of Cisco IOS Software. Cisco IOS Software 
supports varied hardware platforms and features. Cisco continuously develops and 
releases new versions of Cisco IOS Software.
Cisco has a naming convention for Cisco IOS Software ﬁles to identify the different 
versions of these Cisco IOS Software ﬁles, as illustrated by Figure 14-3.

Figure 14-3 Cisco IOS Software Naming Conventions
As Figure 14-3 shows, this Cisco IOS Software naming convention uses different ﬁelds 
in the name:
■Hardware Platform—The ﬁrst part of the ﬁlename identiﬁes the hardware plat-
form. This image is designed for the hardware platform.
■Feature Set—The second part of the ﬁlename identiﬁes the various features that 
the Cisco IOS Software ﬁle contains. You can choose from many different features, 
and these features are packaged in “software images.” Each feature set contains 
a speciﬁc subset of Cisco IOS Software features. Examples of the feature set cate-
gories are as follows:
— Basic—Basic is a basic feature set for the hardware platform. Examples 
of Basic are IP and IP/FW.
— Plus—Plus is a basic feature set plus additional features such as IP Plus, 
IP/FW Plus, and Enterprise Plus.
— Encryption—Encryption has the 56-bit data encryption feature sets added 
to either a Basic or Plus feature set. Examples include IP/ATM PLUS IPSEC 
56 or Enterprise Plus 56. The encryption designators are k8/k9 starting 
with the Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2. k8 is less than or equal to 64-bit 
encryption on Release 12.2 and up. k9 is greater than 64-bit encryption on 
Release 12.2 and up.
■File Format—The third part of the IOS ﬁlename indicates the ﬁle format. The 
third part speciﬁes if Cisco IOS Software is stored in Flash memory in a com-
pressed format and if the Cisco IOS Software image is relocatable. If the Flash 
image is compressed, Cisco IOS Software must be expanded during boot as the 
image is copied to RAM. A relocatable image is copied from Flash memory into 
RAM to run. A non-relocatable image is run directly from Flash memory.

■Version and Release—The fourth part of the IOS ﬁlename identiﬁes the version 
number and release of Cisco IOS Software. As Cisco develops newer versions of 
Cisco IOS Software, the numerical version number increases.
Managing Conﬁguration File Using TFTP
In a Cisco router or switch, the active conﬁguration is in RAM. The default location 
for the startup conﬁguration in a Cisco router or switch is NVRAM. In the event the 
conﬁguration is lost, you should back up this startup conﬁguration. You can store one 
of these backup copies of the conﬁguration on a TFTP server. You can use the copy
running-conﬁg tftp command to back up the conﬁguration. The steps to perform this 
backup process are as follows:
Step 1
Enter copy tftp running-conﬁg.
Step 2
Enter the IP address of the TFTP server that is to store the conﬁguration 
ﬁle at the prompt.
Step 3
Enter the name to assign to the conﬁguration ﬁle or accept the default 
name.
Step 4
Conﬁrm the choices by typing yes each time.
Example 14-6 demonstrates the actual process.
You can restore the router conﬁguration by loading the backup conﬁguration ﬁle from 
a TFTP server. The steps you can take to restore the conﬁguration are as follows:
Step 1
Enter copy tftp running-conﬁg.
Step 2
Select a host or network conﬁguration ﬁle at the prompt.
Step 3
At the system prompt, enter the IP address of the TFTP server where the 
conﬁguration ﬁle is located.
Step 4
At the system prompt, enter the name of the conﬁguration ﬁle or accept 
the default name.
Step 5
Conﬁrm the conﬁguration ﬁlename and the server address that the system 
supplies.
Example 14-6 Backing Up the Startup Conﬁguration on a TFTP Server
Cougar# copy running-config tftp
Address or name of remote host [] 192.168.119.20
Destination file name [Cougar-config]?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
624 bytes copied in 7.05 secs
Cougar#
NOTE
If the router conﬁg 
ﬁle is missing or if the 
erase startup-conﬁg
and reload commands
have been used, the 
router will not have 
any interfaces conﬁg-
ured. TFTP requires 
IP to make a connec-
tion, so you will need 
to connect to the 
router using the con-
sole port and conﬁg-
ure an IP address for 
the interface that will 
provide access to the 
TFTP server.

Example 14-7 demonstrates the process of restoring the conﬁguration from a TFTP 
server.
To copy the conﬁguration ﬁle from the TFTP server back to the router, perform the fol-
lowing steps: 
Step 1
Enter conﬁguration mode by entering the copy tftp running-conﬁg
command.
Step 2
At the system prompt, select a host or network conﬁguration ﬁle. The 
network conﬁguration ﬁle contains commands that apply to all routers 
and terminal servers on the network. The host conﬁguration ﬁle contains 
commands that apply to one router in particular. At the system prompt, 
enter the optional IP address of the remote host where the conﬁguration 
ﬁle is located. In Example 14-8, the router is conﬁgured from the TFTP 
server at IP address 131.108.2.155.
Step 3
At the system prompt, enter the name of the conﬁguration ﬁle or accept 
the default name. The ﬁlename convention is UNIX-based. The default 
ﬁlename is hostname -conﬁg for the host ﬁle and network -conﬁg for the 
network conﬁguration ﬁle. In the DOS environment, the server ﬁlenames 
are limited to eight characters plus a three-character extension. An 
example is router.cfg. Conﬁrm the conﬁguration ﬁlename and the server 
address that the system supplies. Notice in Example 14-8 that the router 
prompt changes to tokyo immediately. This change is evidence that the 
reconﬁguration happens as soon as the new ﬁle is downloaded.
Example 14-7 Restoring the Startup Conﬁguration from a TFTP Server
Cougar# copy tftp running-config

Example 14-8 demonstrates the process of copying the conﬁguration ﬁle from a 
TFTP server.
Managing Conﬁguration Files with HyperTerminal
Capturing the output of the show running-conﬁg command is another way to create a 
backup copy of the conﬁguration. You can perform this backup from the terminal ses-
sion by copying the output, pasting to a text ﬁle, and saving the text ﬁle. However, this 
ﬁle needs some editing done before you can use it to restore conﬁguration to the router. 
Figure 14-4 shows an example of cutting and pasting conﬁgurations.
To capture the conﬁguration in HyperTerminal text that is displayed on the screen to a 
text ﬁle, use the following steps:
Step 1
Select Transfer.
Step 2
Select Capture Text.
Step 3
Specify the name for the text ﬁle to the capture conﬁguration.
Step 4
Select Start to start capturing text.
Step 5
Display the conﬁguration to the screen by entering show running-conﬁg.
Step 6
Press the space bar when each “-More -” prompt appears, which contin-
ues with the conﬁguration until the end is reached.
Step 7
When the complete conﬁguration has been displayed, stop the capture 
using the following steps:
a. Select Transfer.
b. Select Capture Text.
c. Select Stop.

Figure 14-4 Capturing the Conﬁg File
After the capture is complete, you need to edit the conﬁguration ﬁle to remove extra 
text. To create this ﬁle in a form to be copied and pasted back into the router, remove 
any unnecessary information from the captured conﬁguration. You can add comments 
to the text to explain the various parts of the conﬁguration. Add a comment by begin-
ning a line with an exclamation mark (!).
You can edit the conﬁguration ﬁle from a text editor such as Notepad. To edit the ﬁle 
from Notepad, complete the following steps:
Step 1
Click File > Open.
Step 2
Find the captured ﬁle and select it.
Step 3
Click Open.
The lines you need to delete contain the following:
■show running-conﬁg
■Building conﬁguration...
■Current conﬁguration:
■- More -
■Any lines that appear after the word End

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
At the end of each of the interface sections, add the no shutdown command. Clicking 
File > Save saves the clean version of the conﬁguration.
You can then restore the backup conﬁguration from a HyperTerminal session. How-
ever, before you restore the conﬁguration, remove any remaining conﬁguration from 
the router, which you can do by entering the command erase startup-conﬁg at the 
enable router prompt and then restarting the router by entering reload.
After you remove any remaining conﬁguration, you can use HyperTerminal to restore 
a conﬁguration. You can copy the clean backup of the conﬁguration into the router as 
follows:
Step 1
Go into the router global conﬁguration mode.
Step 2
From the HyperTerminal, choose Transfer > Send > Text File.
Step 3
Select the name of the ﬁle for the saved backup conﬁguration.
Step 4
The lines of the ﬁle are entered into the router as if the lines are being 
typed.
Step 5
Look for any errors.
Step 6
After the conﬁguration is entered, press Ctrl + z to exit the global conﬁg-
uration mode.
Step 7
Restore the startup conﬁguration with copy running-conﬁg startup-conﬁg.
Managing Cisco IOS Software Images with TFTP
Occasionally, the router will need to have the Cisco IOS Software image upgraded or 
restored. The ﬁrst time a router is used, the Cisco IOS Software should be backed up 
to a TFTP server using the copy ﬂash tftp command. This Cisco IOS Software image 
can be stored in a central server with other Cisco IOS Software images to restore or 
upgrade the Cisco IOS Software image on routers and switches in the internetwork.
This server should have a TFTP service running. You can initiate the Cisco IOS Soft-
ware upgrade from the privilege EXEC mode with the copy tftp ﬂash command as 
shown in Example 14-9.
Lab Activity
Copying, Editing, and Pasting Conﬁgurations
In this activity, you capture the running conﬁguration of a router to an ASCII 
text ﬁle with HyperTerminal. You clean up the conﬁguration by editing or 
modifying the captured text ﬁle with a text editor such as Notepad. Then, you 
upload the clean text ﬁle to conﬁgure another router using HyperTerminal.

Managing Cisco IOS Software Images
661
The router prompts you to enter the IP address of the TFTP server. When you are 
prompted for the ﬁlename of the Cisco IOS Software image on the server, the router 
might then prompt you to erase Flash. This prompt to erase Flash often happens if 
there is not sufﬁcient Flash memory available for the new image. As the image is erased 
from Flash, a series of letter “e”s appear to show the erase process.
As each datagram of the Cisco IOS Software image ﬁle is downloaded, an “!” will be 
displayed. This Cisco IOS Software image is several megabytes in size and might take 
some time to download.
The new Flash image is veriﬁed after it is downloaded. The router is now ready to be 
reloaded to use the new Cisco IOS Software image.
Example 14-10 uses a different router and TFTP server and provides additional infor-
mation on the steps used to copy the Cisco IOS Software image from the TFTP server 
back to the router.
After you enter the copy tftp ﬂash command, as shown in Example 14-10, the system 
prompts you for the IP address (or name) of the TFTP server. This address or name can 
be another router serving ROM or Flash software images. The system then prompts 
you for the ﬁlename of the software image. Example 14-10 shows sample output from 
copying a system image, named C4500-I, into Flash memory.

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
If you attempt to copy into Flash memory a ﬁle that is already there, a prompt tells 
you that a ﬁle with the same name already exists. This ﬁle is deleted when you copy 
the new ﬁle into Flash memory. If there is room for both copies in Flash memory, the 
ﬁrst copy of the ﬁle still resides within Flash memory, but is rendered unusable in favor 
of the newest version; it will be listed with the [deleted] tag when you use the show
ﬂash command.
If you abort the copy process, the newer ﬁle will be marked (deleted) because the entire 
ﬁle was not copied and is, therefore, not valid. In this case, the original ﬁle still resides 
within Flash memory and is available to the system.
Managing Cisco IOS Software Images with ROMmon
If the Cisco IOS Software image in Flash has been erased or corrupted, you might need 
to restore the Cisco IOS Software image from the ROM monitor mode (ROMmon). In 
many of the Cisco hardware architectures, the ROMmon mode is identiﬁed from the 
rommon# > prompt.

Managing IOS Images with TFTP
In this activity, you back up a copy of a router’s Cisco IOS image to a TFTP

ory on the router.
1102.book  Page 662  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Managing Cisco IOS Software Images
663
The ﬁrst step in this process is to identify why the Cisco IOS Software image did not 
load from Flash. This problem could be due to a corrupt or missing image or damaged 
Flash memory. Examine the Flash memory with the dir ﬂash: command.
If you locate an image that appears to be valid, attempt to boot from that image. You 
perform this boot attempt by using the boot ﬂash: command. For example, if the image 
name is c2600-is-mz.121-5, the command is as follows:
rommon > boot flash:c2600-is-mz.121-5
You need to check a couple of items if the router boots properly because you need to 
be determine why the router booted to the ROMmon instead of using Cisco IOS Soft-
ware from Flash. First, use the show version command to check the conﬁguration reg-
ister to ensure that it is conﬁgured for the default boot sequence. If the conﬁguration 
register value is correct, use the show startup conﬁg command. This command shows 
if there is a boot system command instructing the router to use the Cisco IOS Software 
for ROMmon.
If the router will not properly boot from the image or there is no Cisco IOS Software 
image, you need to download a new Cisco IOS Software image. You can recover the 
Cisco IOS Software ﬁle either through using Xmodem to restore the image through 
the console or by downloading the image using TFTP from the ROMmon mode.
Downloading Cisco IOS Software Using Xmodem from ROMmon
To restore the Cisco IOS Software image through the console, the local PC needs to 
have a copy of the Cisco IOS Software ﬁle to restore and a terminal emulation pro-
gram such as HyperTerminal. You can restore the Cisco IOS Software image using the 
default console speed of 9600 bps. You can change the baud rate to 115200 bps to 
speed up the download. You can change the console speed from ROMmon mode using 
the confreg command. After you enter the confreg command, the router will prompt 
for the various parameters that can be changed, as shown in Example 14-11.

You must reset or power cycle for the new conﬁg to take effect.
When prompted: “change console baud rate? y/n [n]:” selecting y provides you with a 
prompt to select the new speed. After changing the console speed, restart the router 
into the ROMmon mode. The terminal session at 9600 bps is terminated, and a new 
session is started at 115200 bps to match the console speed.
You can use the xmodem command from the ROMmon mode to restore a Cisco IOS 
Software image from the PC. The format for the xmodem command is as follows:
xmodem -c image_file_name
For example, to restore a Cisco IOS Software image ﬁle with the name c2600-is-
mz.122-10a.bin, type the command as shown in Example 14-12.

The -c in the command format instructs the Xmodem process to use cyclic redundancy 
check (CRC) for error checking during the download.
You will receive a prompt from the router to not begin the transfer and a warning mes-
sage will be shown. The warning message indicates that the bootﬂash will be erased, 
and the router asks to conﬁrm whether or not to continue with the process. When you 
continue the process, the router then prompts to start the transfer.
You now need to start the Xmodem transfer from the terminal emulator. In Hyper-
Terminal, select Transfer > Send. Then, in the Send File popup, specify the image 
name/location, select Xmodem as the protocol, and start the transfer. During the trans-
fer, the Sending File popup displays the status of the transfer.
After the transfer is complete, a message appears indicating that ﬂash is being erased. 
This message is followed by the “Download Complete!” message. Before restarting the 
router, you need to set the console speed back to 9600 bps and the conﬁguration register 
back to 0x2102. Use the confreg 0x2102 command at the privileged EXEC prompt to 
set back the conﬁguration register.
While the router is rebooting, you need to end the 115200 bps terminal session and 
begin a 9600 bps session.
Using Environmental Variables for Restoring Cisco IOS Software 
Images
You can also restore the Cisco IOS Software from a TFTP session. Downloading the 
image using TFTP from ROMmon is the fastest way to restore a Cisco IOS Software 
image to the router. You perform this process by setting the environmental variables 
and then using the tftpdnld command.
   rommon 2 > xmodem -c c2600-is-mz.122-10a.bin 
 Do not start the sending program yet...

Chapter 14: Managing Cisco IOS Software
Because ROMmon has limited functions, no conﬁguration ﬁle is loaded during boot. 
The router, therefore, has no IP or interface conﬁguration. The environmental vari-
ables provide a minimal conﬁguration to allow for the TFTP of the Cisco IOS Soft-
ware image. The ROMmon TFTP transfer works only on the ﬁrst LAN port, so a 
simple set of IP parameters are set for this interface. To set a ROMmon environment 
variable, you type the variable name, then the equal sign (=), and the value for the vari-
able (VARIABLE_NAME=value). For example, to set the IP address to 10.0.0.1, type 
IP_ADDRESS=10.0.0.1 at the ROMmon prompt.
The minimum variables required to use tftpdnld are as follows:
■IP_ADDRESS—The IP address on the LAN interface
■IP_SUBNET_MASK—The subnet mask for the LAN interface
■DEFAULT_GATEWAY—The default gateway for the LAN interface
■TFTP_SERVER—The IP address of the TFTP server
■TFTP_FILE—The Cisco IOS Software ﬁlename on the server
To check the ROMmon environment variables, you can use the set command, as 
shown in Example 14-13.
Once you set the variables for the Cisco IOS Software download, you enter the 
tftpdnld command, as shown in Example 14-14, with no arguments. The ROMmon 
echoes the variables, and then a conﬁrmation prompt appears with a warning that this 
process will erase the Flash memory.
Example 14-13 Checking ROMmon Environmental Variables

         IP_ADDRESS=10.0.0.1

As each datagram of the Cisco IOS Software ﬁle is received, a “!” is displayed. When 
the complete Cisco IOS Software ﬁle has been received, the Flash is erased and the new 
IOS image ﬁle is written. Appropriate messages are displayed as the process is completed.
When the new image is written into Flash and the ROMmon prompt is displayed, you 
can restart the router by typing i. The router now boots from the new Cisco IOS Soft-
ware image in Flash memory.
Verifying the File System
You can use several commands to verify the router ﬁle system. One of those commands 
is the show version command, which you can use to check the current image and the 
total amount of Flash memory This command also veriﬁes two other items concerning 
loading the Cisco IOS Software image. The show version command identiﬁes the source 
of the Cisco IOS Software image that the router used to boot and displays the conﬁgu-
ration register. You can examine the boot ﬁeld setting of the conﬁguration register to 
determine where the router is to load the Cisco IOS Software image. If the current 
image and the boot ﬁeld setting of the conﬁguration register do not agree, there might 
be a corrupt or missing Cisco IOS Software image in Flash or there might be boot sys-
tem commands in the startup conﬁg.
Example 14-15 demonstrates use of the show version command.
TFTP_FILE: GAD/original_2003_Jan_22/c2600-i-mz.121-5

You can also use the show ﬂash command to verify the ﬁle system and to identify the 
Cisco IOS Software image or images in Flash and the amount of Flash memory that is 
available. The show ﬂash command is often used to conﬁrm that there is enough space 
to store a new Cisco IOS Software image. Example 14-16 demonstrates sample output 
from the show ﬂash command.
As mentioned, the conﬁguration ﬁle might contain boot system commands. You can 
use these commands to identify the source of the desired Cisco IOS Software boot 
image. You can use multiple boot system commands to create a fallback sequence to 
discover and load a Cisco IOS Software image. These boot system commands are pro-
cessed in the order of their appearance in the conﬁguration ﬁle.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following key points:
■The default source for Cisco IOS Software depends on the hardware platform, 
but, most commonly, the router looks to the conﬁguration commands saved in 
NVRAM.
■You can use the show version command to display information about the 
Cisco IOS Software version that is currently running on the router.
■You can enter multiple boot system commands to specify the fallback sequence 
for booting Cisco IOS Software. Routers can boot Cisco IOS Software from 
Flash memory, from a TFTP server, and from ROM.
■You use the show ﬂash command to verify that you have sufﬁcient memory on 
your system for the Cisco IOS Software that you want to load.
■With Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2 and later, the naming convention for 
Cisco IOS contains the following three parts:
— The platform on which the image runs
— The special capabilities of the image
— Where the image runs and whether it has been zipped or compressed
■You can copy a system image back to a network server. This copy of the system 
image can serve as a backup copy and can be used to verify that the copy in Flash 
memory is the same as the original ﬁle.
■If you need to load the backup Cisco IOS Software version, you can use a varia-
tion of the copy command, copy tftp ﬂash, to download the image that you pre-
viously uploaded to the TFTP server.
To supplement all that you’ve learned in this chapter, refer to the chapter-speciﬁc Videos, 
PhotoZooms, and e-Lab Activities on the CD-ROM accompanying this book.

A special type of EEPROM that can be erased and reprogrammed in 
blocks instead of one byte at a time. Many modern PCs have their BIOS stored on a 
Flash memory chip so that it can be updated easily if necessary. Such a BIOS is some-
times called a Flash BIOS. Flash memory is also popular in modems because it enables 
the modem manufacturer to support new protocols as they become standardized.
NVRAM (nonvolatile random-access memory)
RAM that retains its contents when a 
unit is powered off.
RAM (random-access memory)
Volatile memory that can be read and written by a

Protocol that allows users to copy ﬁles to and from a ﬁle 
system residing on a remote host or server on the network.
TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
Simpliﬁed version of FTP that allows ﬁles to be 
transferred from one computer to another over a network, usually without the use of 
client authentication (for example, username and password).

Chapter 15
Routing and Routing Protocols
In this chapter, you learn more about the router’s use and operations in performing the 
key internetworking function of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference model’s 
network layer, Layer 3. In addition, you review the difference between routing and routed 
protocols and how routers track distance between locations. Finally, you learn more about 
distance vector, link-state, and hybrid routing approaches and how each resolves common 
routing problems.
Please be sure to look at the e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms associated with this chapter 
that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Routing Basics
Path determination for trafﬁc going through a network cloud occurs at the network layer 
(Layer 3). The path-determination function enables a router to evaluate the available paths 
to a destination and to establish the preferred handling of a packet. Routing services use 
network topology information when evaluating network paths. This information can be 
conﬁgured by the network administrator or can be collected through dynamic processes 
running in the network.
The network layer provides best-effort end-to-end packet delivery across interconnected 
networks. The network layer uses the IP routing table to send packets from the source net-
work to the destination network. After the router determines which path to use, it proceeds 
with forwarding the packet. The router forwards the packet that it accepted on one inter-
face to another interface or port that reﬂects the best path to the packet’s destination.
Routing is the process that a router uses to forward packets toward the destination net-
work. A router makes decisions based upon the destination IP address of a packet. All 
devices along the way use the destination IP address to point the packet in the correct 
1102.book  Page 675  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

676
Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
direction. The destination IP address enables the packet to eventually arrive at its des-
tination. To make the correct decisions, routers must learn the direction to remote net-
works. When routers use dynamic routing, the direction to remote networks is learned 
from other routers. When static routing is used, a network administrator conﬁgures 
information about remote networks manually.
Because static routes must be conﬁgured manually, any network topology changes 
require the network administrator to add and delete static routes to account for the 
changes. In a large network, this manual maintenance of routing tables could require a 
tremendous amount of administrative time. On small networks with very few possible 
changes, static routes require very little maintenance. Static routing does not have the 
scalability of dynamic routing because of the extra administrative requirements. However, 
even in large networks, static routes that are intended to accomplish a very speciﬁc 
purpose often are conﬁgured in combination with a dynamic routing protocol. Although 
dynamic routing protocols can determine automatically routes, they still must be acti-
vated initially and conﬁgured by a network administrator to accomplish this. 
The sections that follow cover various routing concepts:
■The process of routing packets from source to destination
■Addressing
■Path selection and packet switching
■Routed and routing protocols
How Routers Route Packets from Source to Destination
To be truly practical, a network must consistently represent the paths available between 
routers. As Figure 15-1 shows, each line between the routers has a number that the 
routers use as a network address. These addresses must convey information that can 
be used by a routing process to pass packets from a source toward a destination. Using 
these addresses, the network layer can provide a relay connection that interconnects 
independent networks.
The consistency of Layer 3 addresses across the entire internetwork also improves the 
use of bandwidth by preventing unnecessary broadcasts. Broadcasts invoke unneces-
sary process overhead and waste capacity on any devices or links that do not need to 
receive the broadcasts. By using consistent end-to-end addressing to represent the path 
of media connections, the network layer can ﬁnd a path to the destination without 
unnecessarily burdening the devices or links on the internetwork with broadcasts.

Figure 15-1 Network Addresses
Network and Host Addressing
The router uses the network address to identify the destination network of a packet 
within an internetwork. Figure 15-2 shows three network numbers identifying seg-
ments connected to the router.
Figure 15-2 Network Addresses with Host Portions
Most network protocol-addressing schemes use some form of host or node address. 
For some network layer protocols, a network administrator assigns network host 
addresses according to a predetermined internetwork addressing plan. For other net-
work layer protocols, assignment of host addresses is partially or completely dynamic. 
In Figure 15-2, three hosts share the network number 1.

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Path Selection and Packet Switching
A router generally relays a packet from one data link to another using two basic functions:
■A path-determination function
■A switching function
Figure 15-3 illustrates how routers use addressing for these routing and switching 
functions. The router uses the network portion of the address to make path selections 
to pass the packet to the next router along the path.
The switching function allows a router to accept a packet on one interface and for-
ward it through a second interface. The path-determination function enables the router 
to select the most appropriate interface for forwarding a packet. The node portion of 
the address is used by the ﬁnal router (the router connected to the destination network) 
to deliver the packet to the correct host.
Figure 15-3 How Routers Use Addressing for Routing and Switching Functions
Routed Protocols Versus Routing Protocols
Because of the similarity of the two terms, confusion often exists regarding the routed 
protocol and the routing protocol (see Figure 15-4). The following provides some 
clariﬁcation:
■Routed protocol—Any network protocol that provides enough information in its 
network layer address to allow a packet to be forwarded from one host to another 
host based on the addressing scheme. Routed protocols deﬁne the ﬁeld formats 
within a packet. Packets generally are conveyed from end system to end system. 
A routed protocol uses the routing table to forward packets. The Internet Proto-
col (IP) is an example of a routed protocol.

■Routing protocol—Protocol that supports a routed protocol by providing mech-
anisms for sharing routing information. Routing protocol messages move between 
the routers. A routing protocol allows the routers to communicate with other 
routers to update and maintain tables. TCP/IP examples of routing protocols are 
listed here:
— Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
— Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)
— Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
— Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
Figure 15-4 Router and Routing Protocols
Network Layer Protocol Operations
Suppose that a host application needs to send a packet to a destination on a different 
network. The host addresses the data link frame to the router, using the address of one 
of the router’s interfaces. The router’s network layer process examines the incoming 
packet’s Layer 3 header to determine the destination network and then references the 
routing table, which associates networks to outgoing interfaces (see Figure 15-5). The 
packet is encapsulated again in the data link frame that is appropriate for the selected 
interface and is queued for delivery to the next hop in the path.

When the packet reaches the router that is connected to the destination host’s network, 
it is encapsulated in the destination LAN’s data link frame type and is delivered to the 
destination host.
Multiprotocol Routing
Routers are capable of supporting multiple independent routing protocols and main-
taining routing tables for several routed protocols. This capability allows a router to 
deliver packets from several routed protocols over the same data links (see Figure 15-6).

Static Routing

Static Routing
Routing is nothing more than directions for getting from one network to another. 
These directions, also known as routes, can be given to the router dynamically by 
another router. An administrator also can statically assign these directions to the 
router. This section concentrates on routes that are assigned by an administrator.
Static Versus Dynamic Routes
Static route knowledge is administered manually by a network administrator who 
enters it into a router’s conﬁguration. The administrator must update this static route 
entry manually whenever an internetwork topology change requires an update.
Dynamic route knowledge works differently. After a network administrator enters 
conﬁguration commands to start dynamic routing, the route knowledge automatically 
is updated by a routing process whenever new information is received from the inter-
network. Changes in dynamic knowledge are exchanged between routers as part of the 
update process.
The Purpose of a Static Route
Static routing has several useful applications. Dynamic routing tends to reveal every-
thing known about an internetwork; for security reasons, however, you might want to 
hide parts of an internetwork. Static routing enables you to specify the information 
that you want to reveal about restricted networks.
When a network is accessible by only one path, a static route to the network can be 
sufﬁcient. This type of network is called a stub network. A stub network is an OSPF 
area that carries a default route, intra-area routes, and interarea routes, but that does 
not carry external routes. Conﬁguring static routing to a stub network avoids the over-
head of dynamic routing, as shown in Figure 15-7.
Static Route Operation
Static route operations can be summarized into a three-part sequence:
1. The network administrator conﬁgures the route.
2. The router installs the route in the routing table.
3. Packets are routed using the static route.

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Figure 15-7 Static Route Operation 
Because a static route is conﬁgured manually, the administrator must conﬁgure the 
static route on the router using the ip route command. The correct syntax for the ip 
route command is as follows:
Router(config)# ip route  prefix mask {address | interface}[distance]
In Figure 15-8, the network administrator of the Hoboken router needs to conﬁgure 
a static route pointing to the 172.16.1.0/24 and 172.16.5.0/24 networks on the other  
routers.

Static Routing
683
The administrator could enter one of two commands to accomplish this objective. The 
method in Example 15-1 speciﬁes the outgoing interface (Serial 0). The method in 
Example 15-2 speciﬁes the next-hop IP address of the adjacent router (172.16.2.2). 
Either of the commands installs a static route in the routing table of Hoboken. The 
only difference between the two commands is in the administrative distance that the 
router assigns to the route as it is placed in the routing table.
The administrative distance is an optional parameter that provides a measure of the 
reliability of the route. A lower value for the administrative distance indicates a more 
reliable route. This means that a route with a lower administrative distance will be 
installed before an identical route with a higher administrative distance. The default 
administrative distance when using next-hop address is 1. The default administrative 
distance when using the outgoing interface is 0. Table 15-1 show Cisco’s administrative 
distance values for each supported protocol. Routes with lower administrative distances 
are trusted over identical routes with higher administrative distances. If an administra-
tive distance other than the default is desired, a value between 0 and 255 is entered 
after the next-hop or outgoing interface, as follows:
ip route 172.16.3.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1 255
Example 15-1 IP Route Using Interface
Sterling(config)# ip route  172.16.3.0  255.255.255.0  s0
Example 15-2 IP Route Using Next-Hop Router IP
Sterling(config)# ip route  172.16.3.0  255.255.255.0  172.16.2.2

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
If the router cannot reach the outgoing interface that is being used in the route, the 
route will not be installed in the routing table. This means that if the interface is
down, the route will not be placed in the routing table. 
Sometimes static routes are used for backup purposes. A static route can be conﬁgured 
on a router that will be used only when the dynamically learned route has failed. To 
use a static route in this manner, set the administrative distance higher than that of the 
dynamic routing protocol being used.
Conﬁguring Static Routes
This section lists the steps for conﬁguring static routes and gives an example of a simple 
network for which static routes might be conﬁgured.
Use the following steps to conﬁgure static routes:
Step 1
Determine all desired destination networks, their subnet masks, and their 
gateways. A gateway can be either a local interface or a next-hop address 
that leads to the desired destination.
Step 2
Enter global conﬁguration mode.
Step 3
Type the ip route command with a destination network address and subnet 
mask followed by their corresponding gateway from Step 1. Including an 
administrative distance is optional.
Step 4
Repeat Step 3 for as many destination networks as were deﬁned in Step 1.
Step 5
Exit global conﬁguration mode.
Step 6
Save the active conﬁguration to NVRAM by using the copy running-
conﬁg startup-conﬁg or write memory commands.

The example network in Figure 15-9 is a simple three-router conﬁguration. Hoboken 
must be conﬁgured so that it can reach the 172.16.1.0 network and the 172.16.5.0 
network. Both of these networks have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 
Figure 15-9 Static Route Operation
Packets that have a destination network of 172.16.1.0 need to be routed to Sterling. Pack-
ets that have a destination address of 172.16.5.0 need to be routed to Waycross. Static 
routes can be conﬁgured to accomplish this using the outgoing router interfaces (S0 
and S1), as shown in Example 15-3.
Both static routes ﬁrst are conﬁgured to use a local interface as the gateway to the 
destination networks, as in Figure 15-10. Because the administrative distance was not 
speciﬁed, it defaults to 0 when the route is installed in the routing table. Remember 
that an administrative distance of 0 is the same as a directly connected network.
Example 15-3 IP Route with Outgoing Interfaces
Hoboken(config)#ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 s1
Hoboken(config)#ip route 172.16.5.0 255.255.255.0 s0

The same two static routes also can be conﬁgured using a next-hop address as their 
gateway. The ﬁrst route to the 172.16.1.0 network has a gateway of 172.16.2.1. The 
second route to the 172.16.5.0 network has a gateway of 172.16.4.2. Example 15-4 
shows conﬁguring static routes using the next-hop interface address and includes 
comments (preceded by !) that will show up in the conﬁguration ﬁle. Because the 
administrative distance was not speciﬁed, it defaults to 1.
Example 15-4 IP Route with Next Hop and Comment
Hoboken(config)# ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.2.1
!This command points to Sterling's LAN
Hoboken(config)# ip route 172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.4.2
!This command points to Waycross LAN

How a Default Route Is Used
Figure 15-11 shows a use for a default route, a routing table entry that directs packets 
to the next hop when that hop is not explicitly listed in the routing table. You can set 
default routes as part of the static conﬁguration.
In this example, the Company X routers possess speciﬁc knowledge of the topology of 
the Company X network, but not of other networks. Maintaining knowledge of every 
other network accessible by way of the Internet cloud is unnecessary and unreasonable, 
if not impossible.
Instead of maintaining speciﬁc network knowledge, each router in Company X is 
informed of the default route that it can use to reach any unknown destination by 
directing the packet to the Internet.
Figure 15-11 Static Default Route Using Next Hop
Conﬁguring Default Route Forwarding
Default routes route packets with destinations that do not match any of the other 
routes in the routing table. Routers typically are conﬁgured with a default route for 
Internet-bound trafﬁc because it is often impractical and unnecessary to maintain 
routes to all networks in the Internet. A default route is actually a special static route 
that uses the following format:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop-address | outgoing interface] 
Use the following steps to conﬁgure default routes:
Step 1
Enter global conﬁguration mode.

B
Company X

No entry for destination net.
Try Router B default route.
C

NOTE
The 0.0.0.0 mask, 
when logically ANDed 
to the destination IP 
address of the packet 
to be routed, always 
yields the network 
0.0.0.0. If the packet 
does not match a more 
speciﬁc route in the 
routing table, it is 
routed to the 0.0.0.0 
network.
1102.book  Page 687  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

688
Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Step 2
Type the ip route command with 0.0.0.0 for the destination network 
address and 0.0.0.0 for the subnet mask. The gateway for the default 
route can be either the local router interface that connects to the outside 
networks or the IP address of the next-hop router. In most cases, it is pre-
ferred that the IP address of the next hop router is speciﬁed.
Step 3
Exit global conﬁguration mode.
Step 4
Save the active conﬁguration to NVRAM by using the copy running-
conﬁg startup-conﬁg command.
Earlier in this chapter, in Figure 15-8, static route conﬁguration was demonstrated on 
router Hoboken to make networks 172.16.1.0 on Sterling and 172.16.5.0 on Waycross 
accessible. It should now be possible to route packets to both of these networks from 
Hoboken. However, as conﬁgured, neither Sterling nor Waycross will know how to 
return packets to any network that is not directly connected. A static route could be 
conﬁgured on Sterling and Waycross for each of the destination networks that are not 
directly connected, but on a larger network this would not be a scalable solution.
Sterling connects to all non-directly connected networks via interface s0. Waycross has 
only one connection to all non-directly connected networks. This is through interface 
Serial 1. A default route on both Sterling and Waycross provides routing for all packets 
that are destined for networks that are not directly connected, as demonstrated in 
Figure 15-12. Examples 15-5 and 15-6 show the commands necessary to deﬁne a 
default static route on Waycross and Sterling, respectively.

Verifying Static Route Conﬁguration
It is important to verify that the static routes are present in the routing table and that 
routing is working as expected after the static routes are conﬁgured. The command 
show running-conﬁg is used to view the active conﬁguration in NVRAM to verify that 
the static route was entered correctly. The show ip route command is used to make 
sure that the static route is present in the routing table. 
Use the following steps to verify static route conﬁguration:
Step 1
In privileged mode, enter the command show running-conﬁg to view the 
active conﬁguration.
Step 2
Verify that the static route has been entered correctly. If the route is not 
correct, it will be necessary to go back into global conﬁguration mode to 
remove the incorrect static route and enter the correct one.
Step 3
Enter the command show ip route.
Step 4
Verify that the route that was conﬁgured is in the routing table.
Troubleshooting Static Route Conﬁguration 
Having knowledge of troubleshooting tools and procedures is just as important in 
static routing as in any other aspect of networking. You can use the show interfaces
command to check the state and conﬁguration of the interface that is to be used for the 
route gateway. Using the ping command helps you to determine whether end-to-end 
connectivity exists. If an echo reply is not received after a ping, you can use the tracer-
oute command to determine which router in the route path is dropping the packets. 
The routing process must happen on each router the packet travels through, or the 
packet will be dropped. In many cases, packets actually reach their destination, but the 
remote network router has no knowledge of a route to reply to the sender.
Use the following steps to troubleshoot a static route conﬁguration:
Step 1
Make sure that the link that is to be used as the gateway by the route is 
available.
Step 2
Enter the command show interfaces, and verify that the interface is up 
and that the line protocol is up. 
Example 15-5 Default Route for Waycross
Waycross(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s1
Example 15-6 Default Route for Sterling
Sterling(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0
1102.book  Page 689  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

690
Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Step 3
Verify that the IP address being used on the interface is correct.
Step 4
ping the IP address on the remote router interface that is connected 
directly to the route gateway. If the ping is not successful, the problem is 
not related to routing. The interfaces of one or both of the directly con-
nected routers might be conﬁgured incorrectly, or a physical problem 
might exist with the link. Return to Step 1 to troubleshoot.
Step 5
If the ping of the far-end router fails, use the traceroute command to 
determine which router in the route path is dropping the packet.
Step 6
Log into the router with the failed traceroute. Return to Step 1 and start 
again.
Step 7
If the ping is successful, attempt to ping the far-end router. If this ping is 
successful, complete end-to-end connectivity has been achieved. The test 
of the static route is complete.
Dynamic Routing Overview
Dynamic routing is necessary to allow networks to update and adapt quickly to changes. 
The network shown in Figure 15-13 adapts differently to topology changes depending 
on whether it uses statically or dynamically conﬁgured routing information.
Figure 15-13 Dynamic Route 
Static routing allows routers to properly route a packet from network to network based 
on manually conﬁgured information. In the example, Router A always sends trafﬁc 
destined for Router C to Router D. The router refers to its routing table and follows 
A
X
D
B
C
1102.book  Page 690  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Dynamic Routing Overview
691
the static knowledge residing there to relay the packet to Router D. Router D does the 
same and relays the packet to Router C. Router C delivers the packet to the destina-
tion host.
If the path between Router A and Router D fails, Router A is not capable of relaying 
the packet to Router D using that static route. Until Router A manually is reconﬁgured 
to relay packets by way of Router B, communication with the destination network 
is impossible. Dynamic routing offers more ﬂexibility. According to the routing table 
generated by Router A, a packet can reach its destination over the preferred route 
through Router D.
However, a second path to the destination is available by way of Router B. When 
Router A recognizes that the link to Router D is down, it adjusts its routing table, 
making the path through Router B the preferred path to the destination. The routers 
continue sending packets over this link.
When the path between Routers A and D is restored to service, Router A again can 
change its routing table to indicate a preference for the counterclockwise path through 
Routers D and C to the destination network. Dynamic routing protocols also can direct 
trafﬁc from the same session over different paths in a network for better performance. 
This is known as load sharing.
Routing Protocol Examples
This section provides a brief overview of some of the most common routing protocols 
and their key characteristics.
RIP originally was speciﬁed in RFC 1058. Its key characteristics include the following:
■It is a distance vector routing protocol. 
■It uses hop count as the metric for path selection. If the hop count is greater than 
15, the packet is discarded. 
■By default, routing updates are broadcast every 30 seconds.
IGRP is a distance vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. IGRP sends routing 
updates at 90-second intervals, advertising networks for a particular autonomous system. 
IGRP offers the following design characteristics and features: 
■Versatility for automatically handling indeﬁnite or complex topologies 
■Flexibility for handling segments with different bandwidth and delay characteristics 
■Scalability for functioning in large networks 
1102.book  Page 691  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

692
Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
By default, IGRP uses two metrics, bandwidth and delay. IGRP can be conﬁgured to 
use a combination of variables to determine a composite metric. Possible conﬁgurations 
include the following variables:
■Bandwidth
■Delay
■Load
■Reliability
OSPF is a link-state routing protocol used for IP. Link-state protocols keep a detailed 
topology, which allows the protocol to use calculations that prevent loops. With OSPF, 
the subnet mask also is transmitted, enabling features such as variable-length subnet 
masking (VLSM) and route summarization.
EIGRP is a balanced hybrid routing protocol developed by Cisco. EIGRP has charac-
teristics in common with both distance vector protocols and link-state protocols. EIGRP 
calculates the best route to each network or subnet and provides alternative routes that 
can be used if the current route fails. EIGRP also transmits the subnet mask for each 
routing entry. Therefore, features such as VLSM and route summarization easily are 
supported.
BGP is an exterior routing protocol. BGP is designed to operate between autonomous 
systems. BGPs can be used between two ISPs or between a company and an ISP.
Purpose of a Routing Protocol and Autonomous Systems 
The goal of a routing protocol is to build and maintain the routing table. This table 
contains the learned networks and associated ports for those networks. Routers use 
routing protocols to manage information received from other routers and information 
generated from the conﬁguration of its own interfaces. 
The routing protocol identiﬁes all available routes, places the best routes into the rout-
ing table, and removes routes when they are no longer valid. The router uses the infor-
mation in the routing table to forward routed protocol packets.
The routing algorithm is fundamental to dynamic routing. Whenever the topology of 
a network changes because of growth, reconﬁguration, or failure, the network knowl-
edge base also must change. The network knowledge needs to reﬂect an accurate and 
consistent view of the new topology. 
When all routers in an internetwork are operating with the same knowledge, the inter-
network is said to have converged. Fast convergence is desirable because it reduces the 
time period of incorrect routing decisions.
1102.book  Page 692  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Dynamic Routing Overview
693
Autonomous systems divide the global internetwork into smaller and more manage-
able networks. Each AS has its own set of rules and policies and an AS number that 
distinguishes it from all other autonomous systems in the world.
Dynamic Routing Operations
The success of dynamic routing depends on two basic router functions:
■Maintenance of a routing table
■Timely distribution of knowledge, in the form of routing updates, to other routers 
(see Figure 15-14)
Figure 15-14 Routing Protocols Maintain Routing Information 
Dynamic routing relies on a routing protocol to share knowledge among routers. A 
routing protocol deﬁnes the set of rules used by a router when it communicates with 
neighboring routers. For example, a routing protocol describes the following:
■How to send updates
■What knowledge is contained in these updates
■When to send this knowledge
■How to locate recipients of the updates
How Distances on Network Paths Are Determined by 
Various Metrics
When a routing algorithm updates a routing table, its primary objective is to determine 
the best information to include in the table. Each routing algorithm interprets what is 
best in its own way. The algorithm generates a number called the metric value for each 
path through the network. Typically, the smaller the metric number is, the better the 
path is, as shown in Figure 15-15.

Figure 15-15 Metrics Used to Deﬁne Best Path 
You can calculate simple metrics based on a single characteristic such as path, or you 
can calculate more complex metrics by combining several characteristics. The metric 
characteristics that most commonly are used by routers are as follows:
■Bandwidth—The data capacity of a link. (Normally, a 10-Mbps Ethernet link is 
preferable to a 64-kbps leased line.)
■Delay—The length of time required to move a packet along each link from 
source to destination.
■Load—The amount of activity on a network resource such as a router or a link.
■Reliability—Usually a reference to the error rate of each network link.
■Hop count—The number of routers that a packet must travel through before 
reaching its destination.
■Ticks—The delay on a data link using IBM PC clock ticks (approximately 
55 milliseconds, or 1/18 second).
■Cost—An arbitrary value, usually based on bandwidth, monetary expense, or 
other measurement, that is assigned by a network administrator.
Identifying the Classes of Routing Protocols
Most routing algorithms can be classiﬁed under one of the following three categories:
■Distance vector
■Link-state
■Balanced hybrid

Identifying the Classes of Routing Protocols
695
The distance vector routing protocol approach determines the direction, or the vector, 
and the distance to any link in the internetwork. The link-state routing protocol
approach, also called shortest path ﬁrst (SPF), recreates the exact topology of the entire 
internetwork. The balanced hybrid routing protocol approach combines aspects of the 
link-state and distance vector algorithms. 
Distance Vector Routing Protocol Features 
Distance vector routing algorithms pass periodic copies of a routing table from router 
to router. These regular updates between routers communicate topology changes. Dis-
tance vector–based routing algorithms also are known as Bellman-Ford algorithms. 
In Figure 15-16, each router receives a routing table from its neighboring routers. 
Router B receives information from Router A. Router B adds a distance vector number, 
such as a number of hops, which increases the distance vector. Then Router B passes 
this new routing table to its other neighbor, Router C. This step-by-step process occurs 
in all directions between all neighbor routers.
Figure 15-16 Distance Vector Concepts 
The algorithm accumulates network distances so that it can maintain a database of 
network topology information. However, distance vector algorithms do not provide 
routers with the exact topology of an internetwork because each router is aware of 
only its neighbor routers.

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Each router that uses distance vector routing begins by identifying its neighbors. Fig-
ure 15-17 shows distance vector discovery. The interface that leads to each directly 
connected network is shown as having a distance of 0. As the distance vector network 
discovery process proceeds, routers discover the best path to destination networks based 
on the information they receive from each neighbor. For example, Router A learns 
about other networks based on the information that it receives from Router B. Each 
of the other network entries in the routing table has an accumulated distance vector to 
show how far away that network is in a given direction.
Figure 15-17 Distance Vector Network Discovery 
Routing table updates occur when the topology changes. As with the network discov-
ery process, topology change updates proceed step by step from router to router, as 
shown in Figure 15-18. Distance vector algorithms call for each router to send its entire 
routing table to each of its adjacent neighbors. The routing tables include information 
about the total path cost as deﬁned by its metric and the logical address of the ﬁrst 
router on the path to each network contained in the table. The metric is made up of 
several components, as shown in Figure 15-19.

Figure 15-19 Distance Vector Routing Metric Components 
Routing Updates Explained
Each router receives a routing table from its directly connected neighboring routers. 
For example, in Figure 15-18, Router B receives information from Router A. Router B 
adds a distance vector number (such as a number of hops), which increases the distance 
vector and passes this new routing table to its another neighbor router. This same step-
by-step process occurs in all directions between direct-neighbor routers.
A distance vector is comparable to the signs along a highway. Highway signs direct 
drivers toward a destination and indicate the distance to that destination. Farther down 
the highway, additional signs point toward the same destination, but now the distance 
is shorter. As long as the distance continues to become shorter, the trafﬁc is on the right 
path.
Link-State Routing Basics
The second basic algorithm used for routing is the link-state algorithm. Link-state algo-
rithms are also known as Dijkstras algorithm or as shortest path ﬁrst (SPF) algorithms. 
They maintain a complex database of topology information. Whereas the distance 
vector algorithm has nonspeciﬁc information about distant networks and no knowl-
edge of distant routers, a link-state routing algorithm maintains full knowledge of dis-
tant routers and how they interconnect. Link-state routing uses the following:
■Link-state advertisements (LSAs)—Small packets of routing information that 
are sent between routers
■Topological database—A collection of information gathered from LSAs
■Shortest path ﬁrst (SPF) algorithm—A calculation performed on the database 
resulting in the SPF tree
■Routing table—A list of the known paths and interfaces

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Engineers have implemented this link-state concept in Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) 
routing. RFC 1583 contains a description of OSPF link-state concepts and operations.
Figure 15-20 illustrates these link-state concepts.
Figure 15-20 Link-State Concepts 
Network Discovery Processes for Link-State Routing
LSAs are exchanged between routers, starting with directly connected networks. Each 
router, in parallel with others, constructs a topological database consisting of all the 
exchanged LSAs. 
The SPF algorithm computes network accessibility. The router constructs this logical 
topology as a tree, with itself as the root, consisting of all possible paths to each net-
work in the link-state protocol internetwork. It then sorts these paths using SPF. The 
router lists the best paths and the interfaces to these destination networks in the rout-
ing table. The router also maintains other databases of topology elements and status 
details.
How Link-State Protocols Exchange Routing Information
Link-state network-discovery mechanisms are used to create a common picture of the 
entire network. All link-state routers share this view of the network. This is similar to 
having several identical maps of a town. In Figure 15-21, four networks (W, X, Y, and

Z) are connected by three link-state routers. Network discovery for link-state routing 
uses the following processes:
1. Routers exchange LSAs with each other. Each router begins with directly con-
nected networks for which it has direct, ﬁrsthand information.
2. Each router, in parallel with the others, constructs a topological database consist-
ing of all the LSAs from the internetwork.
3. The SPF algorithm computes network reachability. The router constructs this 
logical topology as a tree, with itself as root, consisting of all possible paths to 
each network in the link-state protocol internetwork. It then sorts these paths by 
shortest path ﬁrst (SPF).
4. The router lists its best paths and the ports to these destination networks in the 
routing table. It also maintains other databases of topology elements and status 
details.
Figure 15-21 Link-State Algorithm Shortest Path Calculations
When a router becomes aware of a link-state topology change, it forwards the infor-
mation so that all other routers can use it for updates. This involves sending common 
routing information to all routers in the internetwork. To achieve convergence, each 
router keeps track of its neighbor routers, the router name, interface status, and the 
cost of the link to the neighbor. The router constructs an LSA packet that lists this infor-
mation along with new neighbors, changes in link costs, and links that are no longer 
valid. The LSA packet then is sent out so that all other routers receive it. Figure 15-22 
shows an example of link-state topology changes.

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
Figure 15-22 Link-State Topology Changes
When the router receives an LSA packet, the database is updated with the most recent 
information. The accumulated data is used to compute a map of the internetwork, and 
the SPF algorithm calculates the shortest path to other networks. Each time an LSA 
packet changes the link-state database, SPF recalculates the best paths and updates the 
routing table. Every router takes the topology change into account to determine the 
shortest path to use for packet routing.
Three Link-State Concerns
Running link-state protocols brings up three primary concerns:
■Processor overhead
■Memory requirements
■Bandwidth consumption 
Routers running link-state protocols require more memory and perform more process-
ing than distance vector routing protocols. Routers must have enough memory to hold 
all the information from the various databases, the topology tree, and the routing table, 
as shown in Figure 15-23. Initial link-state packet ﬂooding consumes bandwidth. Dur-
ing the initial discovery process, all routers using link-state routing protocols send LSA 
packets to all other routers. This action ﬂoods the internetwork and temporarily reduces 
the bandwidth available for routed trafﬁc carrying user data. After this initial ﬂooding, 
link-state routing protocols generally require only minimal bandwidth to send infre-
quent or event-triggered LSA packets reﬂecting topology changes.

Configuring a Router to Use Routing Protocols
701
Figure 15-23 Link State Concerns 
Hybrid Routing Protocol Features
A third type of routing protocol, balanced hybrid routing, combines aspects of both 
distance vector and link-state routing protocols. Balanced hybrid routing protocols use 
distance vectors with more accurate metrics to determine the best paths to destination 
networks. However, they differ from most distance vector protocols by using topology 
changes to trigger routing database updates instead of periodic updates.
Like link-state protocols, the balanced hybrid routing protocol converges rapidly. How-
ever, it differs from distance vector and link-state protocols by using less bandwidth, 
memory, and processor overhead. Examples of hybrid protocols are Intermediate 
System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing 
Protocol (EIGRP). 
Conﬁguring a Router to Use Routing Protocols
To enable an IP routing protocol on a router, both global and interface parameters 
must be set. Global tasks include selecting a routing protocol, such as RIP, IGRP, 
EIGRP, or OSPF. The major task in the routing conﬁguration mode is to indicate IP

Chapter 15: Routing and Routing Protocols
network numbers. Dynamic routing uses broadcasts and multicasts to communicate 
with other routers. The routing metric helps routers ﬁnd the best path to each network 
or subnet. 
The router command starts a routing process. The syntax for the router command is as 
follows:
Router(config)#router protocol {options}
where
■protocol is either RIP, IGRP, or EIGRP.
■options refers to autonomous system number such as those used by IGRP and 
EIGRP.
The network command is necessary because it enables the routing process to identify 
the interfaces that participate in the sending and receiving of routing updates. The syn-
tax for the network command is as follows:
Router(config-router)#network network number
where network number is the IP network number of a directly connected network.
For RIP and IGRP, the network numbers must be based on the network class 
addresses, not subnet addresses or individual host addresses. Major network addresses 
are limited to Class A, B, and C network numbers.
At the Internet layer of the TCP/IP suite of protocols, a router can use an IP routing 
protocol to accomplish routing through the implementation of a speciﬁc routing 
algorithm. Examples of IP routing protocols include the following, as shown in 
Figure 15-24:
■Routing Information Protocol (RIP)—A distance vector interior routing protocol 
■Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)—A distance vector interior routing 
protocol developed by Cisco
■Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)—A link-state interior routing protocol 
■Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)—A balanced hybrid 
interior routing protocol developed by Cisco
■Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)—An exterior routing protocol

Autonomous Systems and IGP vs. EGP

Figure 15-24 Routing Protocols 
Autonomous Systems and IGP vs. EGP 
An interior gateway protocol (IGP) is designed for use in a network controlled or 
administered by a single organization. An IGP is designed to ﬁnd the best path through 
the network. In other words, the metric and how that metric is used is the most impor-
tant element in an IGP. 
An exterior gateway protocol (EGP) is designed for use between networks that are 
controlled by two different organizations. EGPs typically ARE used between Internet 
service providers (ISPs) or between a company and an ISP. For example, a company 
would run BGP, an EGP, between one of its routers and a router inside an ISP. IP EGPs 
require the following three sets of information before routing can begin:
■A list of neighbor routers to exchange routing information with
■A list of networks to advertise as directly reachable
■The autonomous system number of the local router
An EGP must isolate autonomous systems. Because autonomous systems are managed 
by different administrations, networks must have a protocol to communicate between 
different systems. Figure 15-25 shows an autonomous system.

distance vector routing protocol
A class of routing algorithms that iterate on the 
number of hops in a route to ﬁnd a shortest-path spanning tree. Distance vector routing 
algorithms call for each router to send its entire routing table in each update, but only 
to its neighbors. Distance vector routing algorithms can be prone to routing loops but 
are computationally simpler than link-state routing algorithms. Also called a Bellman-
Ford routing algorithm.
dynamic routing
Routing that adjusts automatically to network topology or trafﬁc 
changes. Also called adaptive routing. Requires that a routing protocol be run between 
routers.
exterior gateway protocol (EGP)
A routing protocol designed for use between 
networks that are controlled by two different organizations. 
interior gateway protocol (IGP)
A routing protocol that is designed for use in a 
network controlled or administered by a single organization.

Small packets of routing information that are sent 
between routers.
link-state routing protocol
A routing algorithm in which each router broadcasts or 
multicasts information regarding the cost of reaching each of its neighbors to all nodes 
in the internetwork. Link-state algorithms create a consistent view of the network and 
are therefore not prone to routing loops. However, they achieve this at the cost of rela-
tively greater computational difﬁculty and more widespread trafﬁc than do distance 
vector routing algorithms.

When dynamic routing protocols direct trafﬁc from the same session 
over different paths in a network for better performance.
metric

Typically, the smaller the metric number is, the better the path is.
routed protocol
A protocol that can be routed by a router. A router must be capable 
of interpreting the logical internetwork as speciﬁed by that routed protocol. Examples

Chapter 16
Distance Vector Routing 
Protocols
Now that you have learned about routing protocols, you are ready to conﬁgure IP routing 
protocols. As you know, routers can be conﬁgured to use one or more IP routing protocols. 
In this chapter, you learn the initial conﬁguration of the router to enable the Routing 
Information Protocol (RIP) and the Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP). In addition, 
you learn how to monitor IP routing protocols.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that 
you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed 
to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Initial Router Conﬁguration
After testing the hardware and loading the Cisco IOS Software image, the router ﬁnds 
and applies the conﬁguration statements. These entries provide the router with details 
about router-speciﬁc attributes, protocol functions, and interface addresses. Remember 
that if the router cannot locate a valid startup-conﬁg ﬁle, it enters an initial router conﬁg-
uration mode called setup mode or system conﬁguration dialog.
With the setup mode command facility, you can answer questions in the system conﬁgu-
ration dialog. This facility prompts you for basic conﬁguration information. The answers 
that you enter enable the router to build a sufﬁcient but minimal router conﬁguration. 
The setup facility provides the following:
■An inventory of interfaces
■An opportunity to enter global parameters
■An opportunity to enter interface parameters
■A setup script review
■An opportunity to indicate whether or not you want the router to use this 
conﬁguration
1102.book  Page 711  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

712
Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
After you conﬁrm setup mode entries, the router uses the entries as a running conﬁgu-
ration. The router also stores the conﬁguration in nonvolatile random-access memory 
(NVRAM) as a new startup-conﬁg, and you can start using the router. For additional 
protocol and interface changes, you can then use the enable mode and enter the com-
mand conﬁgure.
Distance Vector Routing
This section discusses distance vector routing protocols and their shortcomings, as well 
as identiﬁes solutions to the problems presented by distance vector routing. Distance 
vector–based routing logarithms pass periodic copies of a routing table from router to 
router. These regular updates between routers communicate topology changes.
Maintaining Routing Information Through Distance Vector 
Protocols
Routing table updates occur periodically when the topology in a distance vector proto-
col network changes. It is important for a routing protocol to be efﬁcient in updating 
the routing tables. As with the network discovery process, topology change updates 
proceed systematically from router to router. Figure 16-1 illustrates how distance vector 
protocols handle topology changes.
Figure 16-1 Distance Vector Topology Changes
Distance vector algorithms instruct each router to send its entire routing table to each 
of its adjacent neighbors. The routing tables include information about the total path 
cost, as deﬁned by the metrics, and the logical address of the advertising router on the 
path to each network.

Load Balancing Across Multiple Paths
Load balancing describes the capability of a router to transmit packets to a destination 
IP address over multiple paths. Load balancing is a concept that allows a router to take 
advantage of multiple paths to a given destination. The paths are derived either stati-
cally or with dynamic protocols, such as RIP, Enhanced IGRP (EIGRP), Open Shortest 
Path First (OSPF), and IGRP. Figure 16-2 shows an example of load balancing.
When a router learns of multiple routes to a speciﬁc network through multiple routing 
processes or routing protocols, it installs the route with the lowest administrative dis-
tance into the routing table. Sometimes, the router must choose from many routes pro-
vided by the same routing process with the same administrative distance. In this case, 
the router chooses the path with the lowest cost or metric to the destination. Each 
routing process calculates its cost differently, and the costs might need to be manually 
conﬁgured to achieve load balancing.
If the router receives and installs multiple paths with the same administrative distance 
and cost to a destination, load balancing can occur. Cisco IOS Software imposes a six 
equal-cost routes limit on the routing table, but some Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) 
set their own limitations. For example, EIGRP allows up to four equal-cost routes.
By default, most IP routing protocols install a maximum of four parallel routes in a 
routing table. Static routes always install six routes. The exception is the exterior rout-
ing protocol Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which by default allows only one path 
to a destination.
The number of maximum paths ranges from one to six paths. To change the maximum 
number of parallel paths allowed in a routing table, use the following command while 
in router conﬁguration mode:
 
maximum-paths 
 
maximum
IGRP can load balance up to six unequal links. RIP networks must have the same hop 
count to load balance, whereas IGRP uses bandwidth to determine how to load balance.
In Figure 16-2, there are three ways to access Network X:
 
■E to B to A with a metric of 30
 
■E to C to A with a metric of 20
 
■E to D to A with a metric of 45
Router E chooses the second path, E to C to A with a metric of 20, which is a lower 
cost than 30 and 45. If two or more of the paths had the same metric, load balancing 
could occur.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
Figure 16-2 Load Balancing
When routing IP, Cisco IOS Software offers two methods of load balancing:
 
■Per-packet load balancing
 
■Per-destination load balancing
If process switching is enabled, the router alternates paths on a per-packet basis. If 
fast switching is enabled, only one of the alternate routes is cached for the destination 
address, so all packets in the packet stream bound for a speciﬁc host take the same 
path. Packets bound for a different host on the same network might use an alternate 
route, in which case trafﬁc is load balanced on a per-destination basis.
How Routing Loops Occur in Distance Vector
Routing loops can occur if a network experiences slow convergence as the result changes 
in the network or routing topology causing inconsistent routing entries. Figure 16-3 
demonstrates routing loops.

Distance Vector Routing
715
The process of how a routing loop occurs (based on Figure 16-3) is as follows:
1. Just before the failure of Network 1, all routers have consistent knowledge and 
correct routing tables. The network is said to have converged. Assume for the 
remainder of this example that for Router C, the preferred path to Network 1 is 
by way of Router B, and the distance from Router C to Network 1 is three.
2. When Network 1 fails, Router E sends an update to Router A. Router A stops 
routing packets to Network 1, but Routers B, C, and D continue to do so 
because they have not yet been informed of the failure. When Router A sends 
out its update, Routers B and D stop routing to Network 1. However, Router C 
has not received an update. To Router C, Network 1 is still reachable through 
Router B.
3. Now Router C sends a periodic update to Router D, indicating a path to Net-
work 1 by way of Router B. Router D changes its routing table to reﬂect this 
incorrect information, and sends the information to Router A. Router A sends 
the information to Routers B and E, and so on. Any packet destined for Network 
1 now loops from Router C to B to A to D and back again to C.
Deﬁning a Maximum to Prevent Count to Inﬁnity
The invalid updates of Network 1 continue to loop until some other process stops the 
looping. This condition, called count to inﬁnity, loops packets continuously around 
the network in spite of the fundamental fact that the destination network, Network 1, 
is down. While the routers are counting to inﬁnity, the invalid information allows a 
routing loop to exist, as illustrated in Figure 16-4.
Figure 16-4 Counting to Inﬁnity
Without countermeasures to stop the process, the distance vector or the metric of hop 
count increases each time the packet passes through another router. Metrics are cov-
ered in Chapter 15, “Routing and Routing Protocols.” These packets loop through the 
network because of incorrect information in the routing tables.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
Distance vector routing algorithms are self-correcting, but a routing loop problem can 
require a count to inﬁnity to resolve. To avoid this prolonged problem, distance vector 
protocols deﬁne inﬁnity as a speciﬁc maximum number. This number refers to a routing 
metric, which might simply be the hop count. Figure 16-5 demonstrates this concept.
Figure 16-5 Deﬁning a Maximum Metric
By assigning a maximum number to inﬁnity, the routing protocol permits the routing 
loop to continue until the metric exceeds its maximum allowed value. Figure 16-5 
shows the metric value as 16 hops, which exceeds the distance vector default maximum 
of 15 hops, and the router discards the packet. In any case, when the metric value 
exceeds the maximum value, Network 1 is considered unreachable.
Eliminating Routing Loops Through Split Horizon
Another possible source for a routing loop occurs when incorrect information that has 
been sent back to a router contradicts the correct information that the router originally 
distributed. The following process, as shown in Figure 16-6, explains how this problem 
occurs:
1. Router A passes an update to Router B and Router D indicating that Network 1 
is down. However, Router C transmits an update to Router B indicating that 
Network 1 is available at a distance of four by way of Router D. This action does 
not violate split-horizon rules.
2. Router B concludes, incorrectly, that Router C still has a valid path to Network 1, 
although at a much less favorable metric. Router B sends an update to Router A, 
advising Router A of the new route to Network 1.

3. Router A now determines that it can send information to Network 1 by way of 
Router B. Router B determines that it can send information to Network 1 by way 
of Router C, and Router C determines that it can send information to Network 1 
by way of Router D. Any packet introduced into this environment loops between 
the routers.
4. Split horizon attempts to avoid this situation. If a routing update for Network 1 
arrives from Router A, then Router B and Router D cannot send information 
about Network 1 back to Router A, as in Figure 16-6. Split horizon thus reduces 
incorrect routing information and reduces routing overhead.
Figure 16-6 Split Horizon
Route Poisoning
Route poisoning is used by various distance vector protocols to overcome large rout-
ing loops and offer explicit information when a subnet or network is not accessible. 
Route poisoning is usually accomplished by setting the hop count to one more than the 
maximum.
Poison reverse is another way of avoiding routing loops. Its rule states:
Once you learn of a route through an interface, advertise it as unreachable back 
through that same interface.
Assume that the routers in Figure 16-7 have poison reverse enabled. When Router One 
learns about Network A from Router Two, it advertises Network A as unreachable

through its link to Routers Two and Three. Router Three, if it shows any path to Net-
work A through Router One, removes that path because of the unreachable advertise-
ment. EIGRP combines these two rules to help prevent routing loops.
Figure 16-7 Route Poisoning
EIGRP uses split horizon or advertises a route as unreachable when
 
■Two routers are in startup mode (exchanging topology tables for the ﬁrst time)
 
■Advertising a topology table change
 
■Sending a query
When route poisoning is used with triggered updates, it will speed up convergence time 
because neighboring routers do not have to wait 30 seconds before advertising the 
poisoned route. Route poisoning causes a routing protocol to advertise inﬁnite-metric 
routes for a failed route. Route poisoning does not break split-horizon rules. Split 
horizon with poison reverse is essentially route poisoning, but speciﬁcally placed on 
links that split horizon would not normally allow routing information to ﬂow across. 
In either case, the result is that failed routes are advertised with inﬁnite metrics.
Avoiding Routing Loops with Triggered Updates
New routing tables are usually sent to neighboring routers on a regular basis. RIP 
updates occur every 30 seconds. However, a triggered update is sent immediately in 
response to some change in the routing table. The router that detects a topology
change immediately sends an update message to adjacent routers. Those routers then
generate triggered updates, notifying their adjacent neighbors of the change. When a 
route fails, an update is sent, rather than waiting on the update timer to expire. The 
use of triggered updates, in conjunction with route poisoning, ensures that all routers 
know of failed routes before any hold-down timers can expire.

A triggered update is an update that is sent without waiting for the update timer to 
expire. The router immediately sends another routing update on its other interfaces, 
rather than waiting for the routing update timer to expire. This action causes the updated 
information about the status of the route to be forwarded and starts the hold-down 
timers more rapidly on the neighboring routers. This wave of updates is transmitted 
throughout the network. Figure 16-8 demonstrates this principle.
Figure 16-8 Triggered Updates
Router C issues a triggered update, announcing that network 10.4.0.0 is unreachable. 
Upon receipt of this information, Router B announces that network 10.4.0.0 is down 
through interface S0/1. In turn, Router A sends out an update through interface Fa0/0.
Preventing Routing Loops with Hold-Down Timers
A count to inﬁnity problem can be avoided by using hold-down timers. The correct 
sequence for this procedure is as follows:
1. When a router receives an update from a neighbor indicating that a previously 
accessible network is now inaccessible, the router marks the route as inaccessible 
and starts a hold-down timer. If an update is received from the same neighbor 
before the hold-down timer expires indicating that the network is again accessible, 
the router marks the network as accessible and removes the hold-down timer.
2. If an update arrives from a different neighboring router with a better metric than 
that originally recorded for the network, the router marks the network as acces-
sible and removes the hold-down timer.
3. If at any time before the hold-down timer expires, an update is received from a 
different neighboring router with a poorer metric, the update is ignored. Ignoring 
updates under these conditions allows more time for the knowledge of a disrup-
tive change to travel through the entire network, as Figure 16-9 shows.

Preventing Routing Updates Through an Interface
Route ﬁltering works by regulating the routes that are entered into or advertised out of 
a route table. The effects are different on link-state routing protocols than they are on 
distance vector protocols. A router running a distance vector protocol advertises routes 
based on the information in its route table. As a result, a route ﬁlter inﬂuences which 
routes the router advertises to its neighbors.
Conversely, routers running link-state protocols determine routes based on informa-
tion in the link-state database, rather than the route entries advertised by neighboring 
routers. Route ﬁlters have no effect on link-state advertisements or the link-state data-
base. For this reason, the information presented here applies only to distance vector IP 
routing protocols such as RIP and IGRP.
Using the passive-interface command can prevent routers from sending routing updates 
through a router interface. Keeping routing update messages from being sent through 
a router interface prevents other systems on that network from learning about routes 
dynamically. As illustrated in Figure 16-10, Router E uses the passive-interface com-
mand to keep routing updates from being sent:
 
RouterE(config-router)#

Examining the Routing Table
721
For RIP and IGRP, the passive-interface command stops the router from sending updates 
to a particular neighbor, but the router continues to accept and utilize routing updates from 
that neighbor. Keeping routing update messages from being sent through a router inter-
face prevents other systems on the interface from learning about routes dynamically.
Examining the Routing Table
A router might learn about routes to destination networks using a dynamic routing 
protocol. It might learn about routes when a network administrator conﬁgures static 
routes. The router very likely uses a combination of dynamic and static routing to dis-
cover routing information. Whatever the method used for route discovery, when a 
router determines that a route is the best path to a destination, it installs the route in 
its routing table. This section describes methods for examining and interpreting the 
contents of the routing table and covers the following topics:
 
■The show ip route command
 
■Determining the gateway of last resort
 
■Determining the route source and destination address
 
■Determining route administrative distance
 
■Determining route metric
 
■Determining route next hop
 
■Determining last route updates
 
■Observing multiple paths to destination
The show ip route Command
One of a router’s primary functions is to determine the best path to a given destination. 
A router learns paths, also called routes, from an administrator’s conﬁguration or from 
other routers via routing protocols. They store this routing information in “routing 
tables” using onboard random-access memory (RAM). A routing table contains a list 
of the best available routes that routers use to make packet forwarding decisions.
The show ip route command displays the contents of the IP routing table. This table 
contains entries for all known networks and subnetworks, as well as a code that indi-
cates how that information was learned. The additional keywords that can be used 
with the show ip route command are as follows:
 
■connected—Used to show the IP routing table on the router
■network—Gives detailed routing information about the speciﬁed network
■rip—Used to show the IP routing table information related to RIP on the router
chpt_16.fm  Page 721  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

722
Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
■igrp—Used to show the IP routing table information related to IGRP on the 
router
■static—Used to show the static IP routing table information on the router
A routing table maps network preﬁxes to an outbound interface. When RTA receives a 
packet destined for 192.168.4.46, it looks for the preﬁx 192.168.4.0/24 in its table. RTA 
then forwards the packet out an interface (Ethernet0) based on the routing table entry. 
If RTA receives a packet destined for 10.3.21.5, it sends that packet out Serial 0/0.
Additionally, RTA drops any packet destined for a network that is not listed in the 
routing table. To forward to other destinations the routing table for RTA has to 
include more routes. These new routes can be added via one of two methods:
■Static routing—An administrator manually deﬁnes routes to one or more 
destination networks.
■Dynamic routing—Routers follow rules deﬁned by a routing protocol to 
exchange routing information and independently select the best path.
Administratively deﬁned routes are said to be static because they do not change until a 
network administrator manually programs the changes. Routes learned from other 
routers are dynamic because they can change automatically as neighboring routers 
update each other with new information. Each method has fundamental advantages 
and disadvantages.
Determining the Gateway of Last Resort
It is not feasible, or even desirable, for a router to maintain routes to every possible 
destination. Instead, routers keep a default route, or a gateway of last resort. Default 
routes are used when the router is unable to match a destination network with a more 
speciﬁc entry in the routing table. The router uses the default route to hand off to 
another router, the gateway of last resort, in an effort to forward the packet.
A key scalability feature is that default routes keep routing tables as small as possible. 
They make it possible for routers to forward packets destined to any Internet host 
without having to maintain a table entry for every Internet network. The default route, 
in many cases, points to the ISP’s network. Default routes can be statically entered by 
an administrator or dynamically learned via a routing protocol.
Default routing begins with the administrator. Before routers can dynamically exchange 
information, an administrator must conﬁgure at least one router with a default route. 
An administrator can use two very different commands to statically conﬁgure default 
routes:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 
ip default-network.
chpt_16.fm  Page 722  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

Examining the Routing Table
723
The ip default-network command establishes a default route in networks using 
dynamic routing protocols.
The global command ip default-network 195.16.11.0 deﬁnes the Class C network 
195.16.11.0 as the destination path for packets that have no routing table entries. For 
every network conﬁgured with ip default-network, if a router has a route to the net-
work, that route is ﬂagged as a candidate for the default route.
Creating an ip route to 0.0.0.0/0 is another way to conﬁgure a default route:
Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next-hop-ip-address | exit-interface]
After conﬁguring a default route or default network, the command show ip route 
shows the following:
Gateway of last resort is 172.16.1.2 to network 0.0.0.0
If router RTY does not have the network in the routing table, it sends the packet to 
172.16.1.2.
Determining Route Source to Route Destination
For trafﬁc going through a network cloud, path determination occurs at the network 
layer. The path determination function enables a router to evaluate the available paths 
to a destination and to establish the preferred handling of a packet. Routing services 
use network topology information when evaluating network paths. This information 
can be conﬁgured by the network administrator or collected through dynamic pro-
cesses running in the network.
The network layer provides best-effort, end-to-end packet delivery across intercon-
nected networks. The network layer uses the IP routing table to send packets from the 
source network to the destination network. After the router determines which path to 
use, it takes the packet from one interface and forwards it to another interface or port 
that reﬂects the best path to the packet’s destination.
Determining Layer 2 and Layer 3 Addresses from the Source to 
the Destination
While network layer (Layer 3) addresses, also known as MAC addresses, are used to 
get packets from source to destination, it is important to understand that a different 
type of address is used to get packets from one router to the next. For a packet to get 
from the source to the destination, both Layer 2 and Layer 3 addresses are used.
The Layer 3 address is used to route the packet from the source network to the desti-
nation network. The source and destination IP addresses remain the same. The MAC 
address (Layer 2) changes at each hop or router. A data link layer address is necessary 
chpt_16.fm  Page 723  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

724
Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
because the source host must have a way of addressing the next-hop router to which 
the packets are being forwarded. Also, when the packet is delivered to the intended 
host on a LAN, the router sends it directly to the host’s MAC address.
Determining Route Administrative Distance
One of the intriguing aspects of Cisco routers, especially for those new to routing, is 
how the router chooses which route is the best among those presented by routing pro-
tocols, manual conﬁguration, and various other means.
As each routing process receives updates and other information, it chooses the best 
path to any given destination and attempts to add this path to the routing table.
The router decides whether or not to add the routes presented by the routing processes 
based on the administrative distance of the route in question. If a path has the lowest 
administrative distance to a particular destination, it is added in the routing table; if 
not, then the route is rejected. Table 16-1 lists the default values for protocols sup-
ported by Cisco IOS Software.

Examining the Routing Table
725
Determining Route Metric
Routing protocols use metrics to determine the best route to a destination. The metric 
is a value that measures the desirability of a route. Some routing protocols use only 
one factor to calculate a metric; for example, RIP-1 uses hop count as the only factor 
to determine the metric of a route. Other protocols base their metric on hop count, 
bandwidth, delay, load, reliability, ticks delay, maximum transmission unit (MTU), 
and cost. Table 16-2 lists and describes each metric.
Table 16-2 Route Metrics 
Metric
Description
Hop count
The number of routers that must be traversed 
to reach a destination. The path with the 
lowest hop count is preferred.
Bandwidth
The link speed. The path with the greatest 
bandwidth is preferred.
Delay
The amount of time it takes for a packet to 
travel a link. The path with the least delay is 
preferred.
Load
The amount of activity on a link. On Cisco 
routers, the value can typically range any-
where between 1 and 255, where 1 repre-
sents a link with the less load and 255 a link 
with the most load. Paths with the smallest 
load are preferred.
Reliability
The error rate on a link. On Cisco routers, 
the value can typically range anywhere 
between 1 and 255, with 255 representing 
a link with the highest reliability. Paths with 
the greatest reliability are preferred.
Ticks delay
Used by IPX RIP and represents the number 
of 1/18-second intervals required to forward 
a packet across a link. Paths with the lowest 
ticks delay are preferred.
Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
The largest packet size (in bytes) allowed on 
a link. Paths with the highest commonly 
shared MTU are preferred.
Cost
An administratively deﬁned metric. Least-cost 
paths are preferred.
chpt_16.fm  Page 725  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

726
Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
Each routing algorithm interprets what is best in its own way. The algorithm generates 
a number, called the metric value, for each path through the network. Typically, the 
smaller the metric number, the better the path.
Factors such as bandwidth and delay are static, in that they remain the same for each 
interface until the router is reconﬁgured or the network is redesigned. Factors such as 
load and reliability are dynamic, meaning that they are calculated for each interface in 
real time by the router.
The more factors that make up a metric, the greater the ﬂexibility to tailor network 
operations to meet speciﬁc needs. By default IGRP uses two static factors to calculate 
a metric value: bandwidth and delay. These two factors can be conﬁgured manually, 
allowing precise control over what routes a router chooses. IGRP can also be conﬁg-
ured to include load and reliability, two dynamic factors in the metric calculation. By 
using dynamic factors, IGRP routers can make decisions based on current conditions. 
Thus, if a link becomes heavily loaded or unreliable, IGRP increases the metric of 
routes using that link. Alternate routes might present a lower metric than the down-
graded route and are used instead.
IGRP calculates the metric by adding the weighted values of different characteristics of 
the link to the network in question. These values (bandwidth, bandwidth divided by 
load, and delay) are weighted with the constants K1, K2, and K3.
Metric = K1 × Bandwidth + (K2 × Bandwidth)/256 - load) + K3 × Delay
The default constant values are K1 = K3 = 1 and K2 = K4 = K5 = 0, so
Metric = Bandwidth + Delay
Determining Route Next Hop
Routing algorithms ﬁll routing tables with a variety of information. Destination/next 
hop associations tell a router that a particular destination can be reached optimally by 
sending the packet to a particular router representing the “next hop” on the way to the 
ﬁnal destination.
When a router receives an incoming packet, it checks the destination address and 
attempts to associate this address with a next hop.
Determining Last Route Updates
A network administrator can use the following commands to ﬁnd the last route 
update:
■show ip route—Used to display the IP routing table on the router.
chpt_16.fm  Page 726  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

■show ip route network—Provides detailed routing information about the speci-
ﬁed network.
■show ip protocols—Used to display IP routing protocol information.
■show ip rip database—Displays the contents of the RIP private database when 
triggered extensions to RIP are enabled.
The default update time for RIP is 30 seconds and for IGRP is 90 seconds.

Rt1 has received a RIP update for the network 200.200.200.0 from 192.168.10.2. RIP

update.

Observing Multiple Paths to Destination
Some routing protocols support multiple paths to the same destination. Unlike single 
path algorithms, these multipath algorithms permit trafﬁc over multiple lines, provide 
better throughput, and are more reliable.
RIP Features
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) was originally speciﬁed in RFC 1058 in 1988. 
Its key characteristics include the following:
■It is a distance vector routing protocol.
■Hop count is used as the metric for path selection (see Figure 16-11).
■If the hop count is greater than 15, the packet is discarded.
■By default, routing updates are broadcast every 30 seconds.
Note in Figure 16-11 that the 19.2-kbps path between the two hosts using the top 
routers is 2 hops. The lower alternate path using the three T-1 links is 4 hops. Because 
RIP path selection is based solely on the number of hops, in this case, RIP path selection 
chooses the 19.2-kbps link instead of the much faster T1 links.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
RIP has evolved over the years from a classful routing protocol, RIP Version 1 (RIP-1), 
to a classless routing Protocol, RIP Version 2 (RIP-2). RIP-2 enhancements include the 
following:
■Capability to carry additional packet routing information
■Authentication mechanism to secure table updates
■Capability to support subnet masks
RIP prevents routing loops from continuing indeﬁnitely by implementing a limit on 
the number of hops allowed in a path from the source to a destination. The maximum 
number of hops allowed in a path is 15. When a router receives a routing update that 
contains a new or changed entry, the metric value is increased by one. If this causes the 
metric to be incremented beyond 15, it is considered to be inﬁnity, and the network 
destination is considered unreachable. RIP includes a number of features that are com-
mon in other routing protocols. For example, RIP implements split horizon and hold-
down mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated.
Enabling RIP on an IP Network
The router rip command enables RIP as the routing protocol. The network command 
is then used to tell RIP which networks are directly connected for the router to adver-
tise. The routing process then associates these interfaces with the network addresses 
and begins using RIP on interfaces.
RIP sends routing-update messages at regular intervals and triggered updates when 
the network topology changes. When a router receives a routing update that includes 
changes to an entry, it updates its routing table to reﬂect the new route. The metric 
value for the path is increased by one, and the source interface of the update is indi-
cated as the next hop in the route. RIP routers maintain only the best route to a desti-
nation; however, RIP routers can maintain multiple routes to the same destination if 
those routes have the same metric.
After updating its routing table due to a conﬁguration change, the router immediately 
begins transmitting routing updates to inform other network routers of the change. 
These updates are sent independently of the regularly scheduled updates that RIP routers 
forward. RIP advertises classful networks or major class networks only.
To enable RIP, use the commands in Table 16-3, beginning in global conﬁguration 
mode.
chpt_16.fm  Page 730  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

RIP Features
731
The following commands show the process of enabling RIP and specifying directly 
connected networks.
BHM(config)#router rip 
! selects RIP as the routing protocol
BHM(config-router)#network 1.0.0.0 
! specifies a directly connected network)
BHM(config-router)#network 2.0.0.0 
! specifies a directly connected network
The Cisco router interfaces that are connected to networks 1.0.0.0 and 2.0.0.0 send 
and receive RIP updates. These routing updates enable the router to learn the network 
topology from a neighboring router that is running RIP.
Using the ip classless Command
Sometimes, a router receives packets destined for an unknown subnet of a network that 
has directly connected subnets. To forward these packets to the best supernet route 
possible, use the ip classless global conﬁguration command. The ip classless command
is enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software Release 11.3 and later. To disable this fea-
ture, use the no form of this command.
When this feature is disabled and a packet is being sent to a subnet of a network that 
has no network default route, the router discards the packet. Figure 16-12 illustrates 
this principle. If the host sends a packet to 128.20.4.1 and no network default route 
exists, the router discards the packet.
IP classless affects only the operation of the forwarding processes in IOS. IP classless 
does not affect the way the routing table is built. This degree of impact is the essence of 
classful routing. If part of a major network is known and the destination subnet 
toward which the packet is destined is unknown, the packet is dropped.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
Figure 16-12 No IP Classless Routing
The most confusing aspect of this rule is that the router uses the default route only if 
the major network destination does not exist in the routing table. By default, a router 
assumes that all subnets of a directly connected network are present in the routing 
table. If a packet is received with an unknown destination address within an unknown 
subnet of an attached network, the router assumes that the subnet does not exist. 
Therefore, the router drops the packet, even if a default route exists. Conﬁguring ip 
classless on the router resolves this problem by instructing the router to ignore the 
classful boundaries of the networks in its routing table and simply route to the default 
route, as Figure 16-13 demonstrates.
Common RIP Conﬁguration Issues
RIP routers must rely on neighboring routers for network information. RIP uses a dis-
tance vector routing algorithm. All distance vector routing protocols have problems 
that result in slow convergence.
Some of these issues include routing loops and counting to inﬁnity. These problems both 
result in inconsistencies due to routing update messages with outdated routes being 
propagated around the internetwork.
To reduce routing loops and counting to inﬁnity, RIP uses the following methods:
■Split horizon
■Poison reverse
■Hold-down timer
■Triggered updates

RIP Features
733
Figure 16-13 IP Classless
Some of these methods might require some conﬁguration, while others do not require 
or rarely require conﬁguration.
RIP permits a maximum hop count of 15. Any destination greater than 15 hops away 
is tagged as unreachable. The maximum hop count for RIP greatly restricts its use in 
large internetworks, but prevents a problem called count to inﬁnity from causing end-
less network routing loops.
The split-horizon rule is based on the fact that it is usually not useful to send informa-
tion about a route back in the direction from which the route came. In some network 
conﬁgurations, it might be necessary to disable split horizon. It is disabled on a per-
interface basis.
To disable split horizon, use the following command:
Router(config-if)# no ip split-horizon
The hold-down timer is another mechanism that might need some changes. Hold-down 
timers help prevent counting to inﬁnity but also increase convergence time. The default 
holddown for RIP is 180 seconds. This holddown prevents any inferior route from being 
updated, but might also prevent a valid alternative route from being installed. The 
hold-down timer can be decreased to speed up convergence, but take such action with 
caution. The ideal solution is to set the timer just longer than the longest possible update 
time for the internetwork. In Figure 16-14, the loop consists of four routers. With each 
router having an update time of 30 seconds, the longest loop possible is 120 seconds. 
Therefore, the hold-down timer should be set to slightly more than 120 seconds.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
Figure 16-14 Hold-Down Timers
To change the hold-down timer, use the following command:
GAD(config-router)# holdown-timer seconds
One additional item that affects convergence and can be conﬁgured is the update inter-
val. By default, Cisco IOS Software runs IP RIP updates every 30 seconds. This time 
can be reconﬁgured for longer intervals to conserve bandwidth or for a shorter interval 
to decrease convergence time.
To change the update interval, use the following command:
GAD(config-router)#update-timer seconds
As discussed earlier in this chapter, another issue with routing protocols is the unwanted 
advertisement of routing updates out a particular interface. When a network command
is issued, RIP sends advertisements out all interfaces within that network address 
range. To control the set of interfaces that exchanges routing updates, the network 
administrator can disable the sending of routing updates on speciﬁed interfaces by 
conﬁguring the passive-interface command.
Because RIP is a broadcast protocol, the network administrator might have to conﬁg-
ure RIP to exchange routing information in a nonbroadcast network such as Frame 
Relay. In this type of network, RIP needs to be informed of other neighboring RIP 
routers. To deﬁne a neighboring router with which to exchange routing information, 
use the following command:
GAD(config-router)neighbor ip address
By default, the software receives RIP-1 and RIP-2 packets, but sends only RIP-1 packets. 
The network administrator can conﬁgure the router to receive and send only RIP-1 
packets or to send only RIP-2 packets. To conﬁgure the router to send and receive 
packets from only one version, use the commands in the router conﬁguration mode as 
speciﬁed in Table 16-4.

To control how packets received from an interface are processed, use the following 
commands described in Table 16-5.
Verifying RIP Conﬁguration
Several commands can be used to verify that RIP is properly conﬁgured. Two of the 
most commonly used commands are show ip route and show ip protocols.
The show ip protocols command outputs information about all the IP routing proto-
cols conﬁgured on the router, as demonstrated in Example 16-5. This output can be

used to verify most, if not all, of the RIP conﬁguration. Some of the most common 
conﬁguration items to verify are the following:
■That RIP is conﬁgured
■That the correct interfaces are sending and receiving RIP updates
■That the correct RIP version is being sent and received
■That the router is advertising the correct networks
The show ip route command can be used to verify that the routes received by RIP are 
being installed in the routing table, as Example 16-6 shows. Examine the output of the 
command and look for RIP routes, signiﬁed by “R.” Remember that the network takes 
some time to converge so the routes might not appear immediately.

RIP Features

The last entry, beginning with the letter R, indicates that network 192.168.3.0 was 
learned from RIP and it can be reached via adjacent router (next hop) interface 
192.168.2.2, which is remotely attached to this router’s Serial 0/0 interface.
Additional commands you can use to check RIP conﬁguration are as follows:
■show interface interface
■show ip interface interface
■show running-conﬁg
These commands are useful when it is necessary to ﬁnd out information about a par-
ticular interface. Using the show interface command displays all information about an 
interface, including whether it is up or down and what type of protocol, IP address, 
or encapsulation type might be conﬁgured on the interface. Basically, these commands 
provide an administrator with all the conﬁguration information that is available about 
a particular interface. The show running-conﬁg command, however, is used to show 
the current conﬁguration on the router and all its interfaces. Recall that a Cisco router 
runs each protocol separately from other protocols. For this reason including the ip
in the show ip interface command is necessary to list speciﬁcally just IP information 
regarding the speciﬁc interface.

Troubleshooting RIP
Most of the RIP conﬁguration errors involve an incorrect network statement, discon-
tinuous subnets, or split horizon. The primary tool for ﬁnding RIP update issues is the 
debug ip rip command.
The debug ip rip command displays RIP routing updates as they are sent and received.

an update.

RIP Features
739
The router sends update information out the two RIP interfaces. The output shows the 
router is using RIP-1 and broadcasts the update (address 255.255.255.255). The num-
ber in parentheses represents the source address encapsulated into the IP header of the 
RIP update.
You can look for several problems in the debug ip rip output. A couple of the problems 
that you can diagnose are discontiguous subnetworks or duplicate networks. A symp-
tom of these problems is a routing protocol’s advertising a network route with a metric 
that is less than the metric received for that network.
Example 16-8 shows the output of the debug ip rip command.
Additionally, you can use the following commands to troubleshoot RIP:
■show ip rip database—Used to display the contents of the private database when 
triggered extensions to RIP are enabled.
■show ip protocols {summary}—Used to display IP routing protocol information.
■show ip route—Used to show the IP routing table on the router.
■debug ip rip {events}—Used to display the RIP information the router is process-
ing across the prompt for an administrator to see.
■show ip interface brief—Lists a summary of an interface’s IP information and 
status in privileged EXEC mode. The brief parameter is an option that displays 
a brief summary of IP status and conﬁguration.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
All of these commands provide information that can be helpful when troubleshooting 
a router.
Load Balancing with RIP
Load balancing is a concept that allows a router to take advantage of multiple best 
paths to a given destination. These paths are derived either statically or with a dynamic 
protocol such as RIP.
RIP is capable of load balancing over as many as six equal-cost paths. Load balancing 
over four paths is the default. RIP performs what is referred to as round robin load 
balancing, which means that RIP takes turns forwarding packets over the parallel paths.
Figure 16-16 shows an example of RIP routes with four equal-cost paths. The router 
starts with an interface pointer to the interface connected to router 1. Then the inter-
face pointer cycles through the interfaces and routes in a deterministic fashion such 
as 1-2-3-4-1-2-3-4-1 and so on. Because the metric for RIP is hop count, no regard is 
given to the speed of the links. Therefore, the 56-kbps path handles as much trafﬁc 
between the two networks as the 155-Mbps path.

Equal-cost routes can usually be found by using the show ip route command. Exam-
ple 16-9 is a display of the output for show ip route to a particular subnet with multiple 
routes.
Notice there are two routing descriptor blocks. Each block is one route. Also, an aster-
isk (*) is next to one of the block entries. This asterisk corresponds to the active route 
that is used for new trafﬁc.
Integrating Static Routes with RIP
Static routes are user-deﬁned routes that force packets to take a speciﬁed path to their 
destination. Static routes become very important if Cisco IOS Software cannot build a 
route to a particular destination. They are also useful for specifying a “gateway of last 
resort,” which all packets without a more speciﬁc route are sent through.

another router running RIP. Another option is for the router to generate the default 
network itself.
The static routes can be removed using the no ip route global conﬁguration command. 
The administrator can override a dynamic route with static routing information using 
administrative distance values. Each dynamic routing protocol has a default adminis-
trative distance, which allows the static route to act as a backup for the dynamic route 
in the event that it fails.
Static routes that point to an interface are advertised via RIP, because static routes that 
point to an interface are considered to be connected in the routing table and thus lose 
their static nature. If a static route is assigned to an interface that is not one of the net-
works deﬁned in a network command, no dynamic routing protocols advertise the 
route unless a redistribute static command is speciﬁed for these protocols.
When an interface goes down, all static routes through that interface are removed 
from the IP routing table. Additionally, when the software can no longer ﬁnd a valid 
next hop for the address speciﬁed as the forwarding address for a router in a static 
route, the static route is removed from the IP routing table.
A static route is one that is speciﬁcally entered by an administrator so that the router 
speciﬁcally knows the route to a destination. A dynamic route is one that is learned by 
the router using the various routing protocol standards. In this case, it is not guaran-
teed that the router knows the route to the intended destination.
To conﬁgure a static route, use the following command in global conﬁguration mode:
ip route prefix mask {address | interface} [distance] [tag tag] [permanent]
In Figure 16-17, a static route is conﬁgured in the GAD router to take the place of the 
RIP route in the event that the RIP route fails. Example 16-10 shows the static route 
being added with an administrative distance of 130,which is referred to as a ﬂoating 
static route. The ﬂoating static route is conﬁgured by declaring an administrative dis-
tance (130), which is greater than the administrative distance of RIP (120). The BHM 
router needs to be conﬁgured with a default route.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
IGRP
Like RIP, Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) is a distance vector routing pro-
tocol. Unlike RIP, IGRP is a Cisco-proprietary protocol rather than a standards-based 
protocol. While remaining very simple to implement, IGRP is a more complex routing 
protocol than RIP, and it is able to use a number of factors to determine the best route 
to a destination network. This section introduces IGRP conﬁguration and troubleshoot-
ing as well as the following IGRP topics:
■IGRP features
■IGRP metrics
■IGRP routes
■IGRP stability features
■Conﬁguring IGRP
■Migrating RIP to IGRP
■Verifying IGRP conﬁguration
■Troubleshooting IGRP
IGRP Features
IGRP is a distance vector IGP. Distance vector routing protocols mathematically com-
pare routes by measuring distances. This measurement is known as the distance vector.
Routers using distance vector protocols must send all or a portion of their routing table 
in a routing update message at regular intervals to each of their neighboring routers. 
As routing information proliferates through the network, routers can perform the fol-
lowing functions, among others:
■Identify new destinations
■Learn of failures
IGRP is a distance vector routing protocol developed by Cisco. IGRP sends routing 
updates at 90-second intervals, advertising networks for a particular autonomous system. 
Key design characteristics of IGRP are as follows:
■The versatility to automatically handle indeﬁnite, complex topologies
■The ﬂexibility needed to segment with different bandwidth and delay characteristics
■Scalability for functioning in very large networks

IGRP
745
By default, the IGRP routing protocol uses bandwidth and delay as metrics. Addition-
ally, IGRP can be conﬁgured to use a combination of variables to determine a composite 
metric. Those variables include
■Bandwidth
■Delay
■Load
■Reliability
IGRP Metrics
The show ip protocols command displays parameters, ﬁlters, and network information 
concerning the routing protocols in use on the router. You need this information to 
deﬁne the value of the K1–K5 metrics and provide information concerning the maxi-
mum hop count to calculate the composite metric for IGRP, which is ﬁgured as fol-
lows:
Metric = [K1 × Bandwidth + (K2 × Bandwidth)/(256 – Load) + K3 × Delay] ×
[K5/(Reliability + K4)]
The metric K1 represents bandwidth, and the metric K3 represents delay. By default 
the values of the metrics K1 and K3 are set to 1, while K2, K4, and K5 are set to 0.
The default constant values are K1 = K3 = 1 and K2 = K4 = K5 = 0. If K5 = 0, the 
[K5/(reliability + K4)] term is not used. So, given the default values for K1 through K5, 
the composite metric calculation used by IGRP reduces to
Metric = Bandwidth + Delay.
The K values in these formulas are constants that can be deﬁned using the following 
router conﬁguration command:
metric weights tos k1 k2 k3 k4 k5 
To ﬁnd the bandwidth, ﬁnd the smallest of all the bandwidths from outgoing interfaces 
and divide 10,000,000 by that number. (The bandwidth is scaled by 10,000,000 in 
kilobits per second.) To ﬁnd the delay, add all the delays from the outgoing interfaces 
and divide this number by 10. (The delay is in tens of microseconds.) Remember, the 
path with the smallest metric is the best path.
This composite metric is more accurate than RIP’s hop-count metric when choosing a 
path to a destination. The path that has the smallest metric value is the best route.
IGRP’s metric includes the following components:
■Bandwidth—The lowest bandwidth value in the path
chpt_16.fm  Page 745  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:16 PM

746
Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
■Delay—The cumulative interface delay along the path
■Reliability—The reliability on the link toward the destination as determined by 
the exchange of keepalives
■Load—The load on a link toward the destination based on bits per second
■MTU—The maximum transmission unit value of the path
IGRP uses a composite metric, which is calculated as a function of bandwidth, delay, 
load, and reliability. By default, only the bandwidth and delay characteristics are con-
sidered; the other parameters are considered only if enabled via conﬁguration. Delay 
and bandwidth are not measured values, but are set via the delay and bandwidth inter-
face commands. The show ip route command in Example 16-11 shows the IGRP met-
ric values in brackets. The ﬁrst number represents the administrative distance, and the 
second number is the calculated metric value. A link with a higher bandwidth has a 
lower metric, and a route with a lower cumulative delay has a lower metric.
Interior, System, and Exterior IGRP Routes
IGRP advertises three types of routes:
■Interior routes are routes between subnets of a network attached to a router 
interface. If the network attached to a router is not subnetted, IGRP does not 
advertise interior routes.

747
■System routes are routes to networks within an autonomous system. Cisco IOS 
Software derives system routes from directly connected network interfaces and 
system route information provided by other IGRP-speaking routers or access 
servers. System routes do not include subnet information.
■Exterior routes are routes to networks outside the autonomous system that are 
considered when identifying a gateway of last resort. Cisco IOS Software chooses 
a gateway of last resort from the list of exterior routes that IGRP provides. The 
software uses the gateway (router) of last resort if a better route is not found and 
the destination is not a connected network. If the autonomous system has more 
than one connection to an external network, different routers can choose differ-
ent exterior routers as the gateway of last resort.
IGRP Stability Features
IGRP has a number of features that are designed to enhance its stability, such as
■Holddowns
■Split horizon
■Poison reverse updates
Holddowns are used to prevent regular update messages from inappropriately reinstat-
ing a route that might not be up. When a router goes down, neighboring routers detect 
this status via the lack of regularly scheduled update messages.
Split horizon is derived from the premise that it is usually not useful to send information 
about a route back in the direction from which it came. The split-horizon rule helps 
prevent routing loops.
Split horizon prevents routing loops between adjacent routers, but poison reverse updates 
are necessary to defeat larger routing loops. Generally speaking, increases in routing 
metrics indicate routing loops. Poison reverse updates then are sent to remove the 
route and place it in holddown. With IGRP, poison reverse updates are sent only if a 
route metric has increased by a factor of 1.1.
IGRP also maintains a number of timers and variables containing time intervals that 
include the following:
■Update timer—Speciﬁes how frequently routing update messages are sent. 
The IGRP default for this variable is 90 seconds.
■Invalid timer—Speciﬁes how long a router waits in the absence of routing-
update messages about a speciﬁc route before declaring that route invalid. 
The IGRP default for this variable is three times the update period.
NOTE
Today, IGRP is show-
ing its age; it lacks 
support for variable-
length subnet masks 
(VLSMs). Rather than 
develop an IGRP ver-
sion 2 to correct this 
problem, Cisco has 
built upon IGRP’s 
legacy of success 
with Enhanced IGRP 
(EIGRP).

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
■Hold-time timer—Speciﬁes the amount of time for which information about 
poorer routes is ignored. The IGRP default for this variable is three times the 
update timer period plus 10 seconds.
■Flush timer—Indicates how much time passes before a route is ﬂushed from the 
routing table. The IGRP default is seven times the routing update timer.
Example 16-12 shows the output from the show ip protocols command. Notice the 
line that indicates the IGRP is running and its metric values.
Conﬁguring IGRP
To conﬁgure the IGRP routing process, use the router igrp global conﬁguration 
command:
RouterA(config)# router igrp as-number
To shut down an IGRP routing process, use the no form of this command.
RouterA(config)# no router igrp as-number 
Example 16-12 IGRP Routing Statistics 
RouterB# show ip protocols
Routing Protocol is "igrp 101"

IGRP
749
The autonomous system number is one that identiﬁes the IGRP process. It is also used 
to tag the routing information.
To specify a list of networks for IGRP routing processes, use the network router con-
ﬁguration command:
RouterA(config)# router igrp 101
RouterA(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
To remove an entry, use the no form of the command:
RouterA(config)# no router igrp 101
RouterA(config-router)# no network 192.168.1.0
Example 16-13 demonstrates how to conﬁgure IGRP using AS 101 on RouterA and 
RouterB.
Verifying the IGRP Conﬁguration
To verify that IGRP has been conﬁgured properly, enter the show ip route command 
and look for IGRP routes signiﬁed by an I.
Additional commands for checking IGRP conﬁguration are as follows:
■show interface interface—Veriﬁes that the Ethernet interface is properly conﬁgured.
■show running-conﬁg—Veriﬁes that IGRP is enabled on the router.
■show running-conﬁg interface interface—Veriﬁes that the proper IP address has 
been used.
■show running-conﬁg | begin interface interface—Veriﬁes that IGRP is running on 
the router’s interfaces starting at a speciﬁc interface.
Example 16-13 Conﬁguring IGRP 
RouterA(config)# router igrp 101
RouterA(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
RouterA(config-router)# network 192.168.2.0
RouterB(config)# router igrp 101
RouterB(config-router)# network 192.168.2.0
RouterB(config-router)# network 192.168.3.0

■show running-conﬁg | begin igrp—Veriﬁes that IGRP is enabled on the router.
■show ip protocols—Veriﬁes that IGRP is enabled on the router.
To verify that the Ethernet interface is properly conﬁgured, enter the show interface 
fa0/0 command. Example 16-14 illustrates the output.
To see if IGRP is enabled on the router, use the commands demonstrated in 
Example 16-15.
To check for proper IP addresses use the command demonstrated in Example 16-16.

the routes available via this router’s interfaces.
Troubleshooting IGRP
Most IGRP conﬁguration errors involve a mistyped network statement, discontiguous 
subnets, or an incorrect autonomous system number.
The following commands are useful when troubleshooting IGRP:
■show ip protocols—Used to display IP routing protocol information in summary 
form.
■show ip route—Used to show the IP routing table on the router.
■debug ip igrp events—Diplays information about summary IGRP routing that is 
running on the network.
■debug ip igrp transactions—Shows message requests from neighbor routers ask-
ing for an update and the broadcasts sent from the originating router towards 
that neighbor router.

Default Routing with RIP and IGRP 
In this lab, you conﬁgure a default route and use RIP to propagate this default 
information to other routers. When you have this conﬁguration working, you 
must migrate the network from RIP to IGRP and conﬁgure default routing to 
work with that protocol as well.

Unequal Cost Load Balancing with IGRP
In this lab, you conﬁgure and tune IGRP for unequal-cost load balancing and 
observe load balancing using debug commands.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following:
■Routing information is maintained through updates as the topology changes in a 
network.
■Routing loops occur in a network from alternate routes, slow convergence, and

Key Terms
755
Key Terms
adjacent neighbor
Two directly connected routers that participate in the exchange of 
routing information are said to be adjacent.
convergence
The speed and capability of a group of internetworking devices running 
a speciﬁc routing protocol to agree on the topology of an internetwork after a change 
in that topology.
count to inﬁnity
A problem that can occur in routing algorithms that are slow to 
converge in which routers continuously increment the hop count to particular net-
works. Typically, some arbitrary hop-count limit is imposed to prevent this problem.
exterior routes
Routes to networks outside the autonomous system that are consid-
ered when identifying a gateway of last resort.
ﬂush timer
Indicates how much time passes before a route is ﬂushed from the routing 
table. The IGRP default is seven times the routing update timer.
holddowns
Prevent regular update messages from inappropriately reinstating a route 
that might not be up.
hold-time timer
Speciﬁes the amount of time for which information about better 
routes is ignored. The IGRP default for this variable is 3 times the update timer period 
plus 10 seconds.
IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
 An IGP developed by Cisco to address 
the problems associated with routing in large, heterogeneous networks. Compare with 
EIGRP. See also IGP, OSPF, and RIP.
interior routes
Routes between subnets of a network attached to a router interface. If 
the network attached to a router is not subnetted, IGRP does not advertise interior 
routes.
invalid timer
Speciﬁes how long a router waits in the absence of routing-update mes-
sages about a speciﬁc route before declaring that route invalid. The IGRP default for 
this variable is three times the update period.
poison reverse updates
Updates that are necessary to defeat larger routing loops. 
Generally speaking, increases in routing metrics indicate routing loops. Poison reverse 
updates are then sent to remove the route and place it in holddown.
RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
An IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet. RIP uses hop count as a routing metric.

Chapter 16: Distance Vector Routing Protocols
routing metric
A method by which a routing algorithm determines that one route is 
better than another. This information is stored in routing tables and sent in routing 
updates. Metrics include bandwidth, communication cost, delay, hop count, load, 
MTU, path cost, and reliability. Sometimes referred to simply as a metric.
routing protocol
A protocol that accomplishes routing through the implementation 
of a speciﬁc routing algorithm. Examples of routing protocols are IGRP, OSPF, and RIP.
routing table
A table stored in a router or some other internetworking device that 
keeps track of routes to particular network destinations and, in some cases, metrics 
associated with those routes.
routing update
A message sent from a router to indicate network reachability and 
associated cost information. Routing updates are typically sent at regular intervals and 
after a change in network topology. Compare with ﬂash update.
split horizon
A routing technique in which information about routes is prevented 
from exiting the router interface through which that information was received. Split-
horizon updates are useful in preventing routing loops.
system routes
Routes to networks within an autonomous system. Cisco IOS Software 
derives system routes from directly connected network interfaces and system route 
information provided by other IGRP-speaking routers or access servers. System routes 
do not include subnet information.
triggered update
A triggered update is an update that is sent without waiting for the 
update timer to expire.
update timer
Speciﬁes how frequently routing update messages are sent. The IGRP 
default for this variable is 90 seconds.

TCP/IP Error and Control 
Messages
Now that you have learned about the router conﬁguration process, it is time to learn 
about Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite error and control 
messages. In this chapter, you learn how the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) 
provides control and message functions. In addition, you learn about potential causes of 
ICMP error messages and how to identify them.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms that 
you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are designed 
to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
Functionality and Role of IP in Error Control
The function of IP is to facilitate network communication between hosts. The design of IP 
allows for the addressing of hosts and networks. This distinguishes IP from nonroutable 
protocols that can address individual hosts but that are not designed to make distinctions 
between networks. IP acceptance is so widespread that, in addition to being the protocol 
used for data delivery over the Internet, it has become the default internal protocol for 
small LANs that do not necessarily require routing capabilities.
The limitation of IP is that it is a best-effort delivery system. IP has no mechanism to 
ensure that the data is delivered regardless of any problems encountered on the network. 
Data might fail to reach its destination for a variety of reasons, such as hardware failure, 
improper conﬁguration, or incorrect routing information. If an intermediary device such 
as a router fails, or if a destination device is disconnected from the network, data cannot 
be delivered. This is why applications that use IP are typically faster: They don’t have the

Chapter 17: TCP/IP Error and Control Messages
error control or reliable mechanism that TCP has. To help identify these failures, IP 
uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). ICMP notiﬁes the sender of the 
data that an error occurred in the delivery process.
The following sections review the different types of ICMP error messages and the 
forms they take. Knowledge of ICMP error messages and an understanding of the 
potential causes of these messages are essential parts of network troubleshooting.
ICMP
ICMP is the component of the TCP/IP protocol stack that addresses IP’s failure to 
ensure data delivery. ICMP does not overcome the unreliability limitation that exists 
in IP. ICMP simply sends error messages to the sender of the data, indicating that 
problems occurred with data delivery. Figure 17-1 shows where ICMP resides within 
the TCP/IP model.
Figure 17-1 ICMP and the TCP/IP Model
This section covers the various facets of ICMP, including ICMP message delivery, error 
reporting and correction, and ways of detecting and handling reachabilty issues.
ICMP Message Delivery
ICMP messages are delivered using the IP protocol. ICMP messages are encapsulated 
into datagrams in the same way that any other data is delivered using IP. Table 17-1 dis-
plays the encapsulation of an ICMP packet within the IP packet datagram data area. 
The frame header can be from a LAN protocol, such as Ethernet, or a WAN protocol, 
such as HDLC.

ICMP
763
Data is encapsulated within a datagram when it reaches the network layer. From there, 
the datagram and its encapsulated data are encapsulated further into a frame at the data 
link layer. ICMP messages have their own header information. However, this informa-
tion, along with the ICMP data, is encapsulated just as any other data is within the 
datagram. ICMP messages are transmitted in the same way as any other data. Therefore, 
ICMP messages are subject to the same delivery failures. This creates a scenario in which 
error reports could generate more error reports, causing increased congestion on an 
already ailing network. For this reason, errors created by ICMP messages do not gen-
erate their own ICMP messages. Therefore, it is possible for a datagram delivery error 
to occur but never be reported back to the sender of the data. 
Error Reporting and Error Correction
ICMP is an error-reporting protocol for IP. When datagram delivery errors occur, ICMP 
reports these errors to the sender of the datagram. For example, Workstation 1 in 
Figure 17-2 is sending a datagram to Workstation 6. When the corresponding interface 
on Router C goes down, Router C uses ICMP to send a message back to Workstation 
1 indicating that the datagram could not be delivered. ICMP does not correct the 
encountered network problem.
In the example from Figure 17-2, ICMP does not attempt to correct the problem with 
the interface on Router C that is preventing datagram delivery. The only capability of 
ICMP is to report the errors back to Workstation 1.
Router C will not notify the intermediary devices of the delivery failure. Therefore, 
Router C will not send ICMP messages to Router A and Router B or to the originating 
device. Router C also does not know what path the datagram has taken to arrive there. 
Datagrams contain only source and destination IP addresses; they do not contain infor-
mation about all the intermediary devices. The reporting device has only the sender’s 
IP address with which to communicate. Although Routers A and B are not notiﬁed 
directly, they might become aware of the down interface on Router C. However, dis-
seminating this information to neighbor routers is not the function of ICMP. Instead, 
ICMP reports on the status of the delivered packet to the sender; its function is not to 
propagate information about network changes.

Chapter 17: TCP/IP Error and Control Messages
Figure 17-2 Error Reporting Being Updated
Unreachable Networks
Network communication depends on certain basic conditions:
■The TCP/IP protocol stack must be properly conﬁgured in the sending and receiv-
ing devices. This includes the installation of TCP/IP and proper conﬁguration of 
the IP address and the subnet mask. A default gateway also must be conﬁgured if 
datagrams are to travel outside the local network. 
■Intermediary devices must be in place to route the datagram from the source 
device and its network to the destination network. Routers serve this function. 
■A router must have the TCP/IP protocol properly conﬁgured on its interfaces, 
and it must use an appropriate routing protocol or static routes. 
If these conditions are not met, network communication cannot take place. For example, 
the sending device might address the datagram to a nonexistent IP address or to a des-
tination device that is disconnected from its network. Routers also can be points of 
failure if a connecting interface is down or if the router does not have the information 
necessary to ﬁnd the destination network. If a destination network is not accessible, it 
is said to be an unreachable network.

ICMP
765
Destination unreachable messages include the following: 
■Network unreachable—This message usually implies routing or addressing 
failures.
■Host unreachable—This message usually implies delivery failures, such as a 
wrong subnet mask. 
■Protocol unreachable—This message usually implies that the destination does 
not support the upper-layer protocol speciﬁed in the packet. 
■Port unreachable—This message usually implies that the TCP port (socket) is not 
available.
Figure 17-3 shows a router receiving a packet that it cannot deliver to its ultimate des-
tination. The packet might be undeliverable because there is no known route to the 
destination. Because there is no known route, the router sends an ICMP host unreach-
able message to the source. 
Figure 17-3 ICMP Host Unreachable
Using ping to Test Destination Reachability
The ICMP protocol can be used to test the availability of a particular destination. 
Figure 17-4 shows ICMP being used to issue an echo request message to the destina-
tion device. When the destination device receives the ICMP echo request, it formulates 
an echo reply message to send back to the source of the echo request. If the sender 
receives the echo reply, this conﬁrms that the destination device can be reached using 
the IP protocol.

The echo request message typically is initiated using the ping command, as demon-
strated in Example 17-1. In this example, the command is used with the IP address of 
the destination device. Example 17-1 and Figure 17-5 show a successful ping or echo 
request/reply.

The ping command also can be used as demonstrated in Example 17-2 using the DNS 
name of the destination device (assuming that DNS is available).
In these workstation examples, the ping command issues four echo requests and receives 
four echo replies conﬁrming IP connectivity between the two devices. The output gen-
erated by the router ping command is somewhat different than the workstation ping
command. Example 17-3 shows a successful and unsuccessful ping from RouterA to 
RouterB (IP address 192.168.100.100). The exclamation marks (!) indicate a successful 
ping, and the periods (.) indicate failure. Table 17-2 shows Cisco ping return codes 
generated when pinging between Cisco devices.

ICMP
769
Detecting Excessively Long Routes
Several problem situations can occur in network communication. In one situation, a 
datagram travels in a circle, never reaching its destination. In another situation, no 
path exists between the source and the destination that conforms to the limitations of 
the routing protocol. An example of the ﬁrst situation arises when two routers contin-
ually route a datagram back and forth. In this scenario, each router operates with the 
understanding that the other router should be the next hop to the destination. One 
potential cause of this problem is faulty routing information. Routing protocols can 
also have limits on the distance that a packet is allowed to travel. For example, RIP 
has a hop limit of 15, which simply means that the packet is allowed to pass through 
only 15 routers. 
In each of these cases, an excessively long route exists. Whether the actual path includes 
too many hops or a circular routing path exists, the packet eventually will reach the 
end of its life. When a packet reaches the end of its life, it has reached its Time-To-Live 
(TTL). The TTL value typically matches the maximum hop count deﬁned by the routing 
protocol. In each datagram, a TTL value is deﬁned. As each router processes the data-
gram, it decreases the TTL value by one. When the TTL value of the datagram reaches 
0, the packet is discarded. ICMP uses a time exceeded message to notify the source 
device that the TTL has been exceeded.
ICMP Message Format: Echo Messages
As with any type of packet, ICMP messages have special formats. Each ICMP message 
type shown in Table 17-3 has its own unique characteristics. However, all ICMP mes-
sage formats start with the following three ﬁelds:
■Type
■Code
■Checksum
C
An ICMP source quench message 
was received.
A device along the path—possibly 
the destination—might be receiving 
too much trafﬁc; check input 
queues.
&
An ICMP time exceeded message 
was received.
A routing loop might have occurred.

further information that is speciﬁc to the message type. The Checksum ﬁeld, as in 
other types of packets, veriﬁes the integrity of the data.

ICMP Message Format: Destination Unreachable Message
Datagrams cannot always be forwarded to their destinations, as shown in Figure 17-7. 
Hardware failures, improper protocol conﬁguration, down interfaces, and incorrect 
routing information are some of the reasons why successful delivery might not be 
possible. In these cases, ICMP delivers back to the sender a destination unreachable 
message indicating that the datagram could not be properly forwarded. 
Figure 17-7 Destination Unreachable Message
Figure 17-8 shows an ICMP destination unreachable message header. The value of 3 in 
the Type ﬁeld indicates that it is a destination unreachable message. The Code value 
indicates the reason why the packet could not be delivered. The Code value is 0, 
indicating that the network was unreachable. Table 17-4 displays Code values and 
description.

A destination unreachable message also might be sent when packet fragmentation is 
required to forward a packet. Fragmentation is usually necessary when a datagram is 
forwarded from a Token Ring network to an Ethernet network. If the datagram does 
not allow fragmentation, the packet cannot be forwarded. Therefore, a destination 
unreachable message is sent. Destination unreachable messages also can be generated 
if IP-related services such as FTP or web services are unavailable. To effectively trouble-
shoot an IP network, it is necessary to understand the various causes of ICMP destination 
unreachable messages.

Miscellaneous Error Reporting
Devices that process datagrams might not be capable of forwarding a datagram because 
of some type of error in the header. This error does not relate to the state of the desti-
nation host or network, but it still prevents the datagram from being processed and 
delivered. In this case, an ICMP Type 12 parameter problem message is sent to the 
source of the datagram. Figure 17-9 shows the parameter problem message header. 
The parameter problem message includes the Pointer ﬁeld in the header. When the

TCP/IP Suite Control Messages
Unlike error messages, control messages are not the result of lost packets or error con-
ditions that occur during packet transmission. Instead, control messages inform hosts 
of conditions such as network congestion or the existence of a better gateway to a 
remote network. Like all ICMP messages, ICMP control messages are encapsulated 
within an IP datagram. ICMP uses IP datagrams to traverse multiple networks.
ICMP uses multiple types of control messages; Table 17-3 listed some of the most 
common. Many of these control messages are discussed in the following sections.
ICMP Redirect/Change Requests
A common ICMP control message is the ICMP redirect/change request. This type of 
message can be initiated only by a gateway. All hosts that communicate with multiple 
IP networks must be conﬁgured with a default gateway. This default gateway is the 
address of a router port connected to the same network as the host. Figure 17-10 
displays a host connected to a router that has access to the Internet.

Figure 17-10 Redirect Request
After it is conﬁgured with the IP address of Fa 0/0 as its default gateway, Host B uses 
that IP address to reach any network not directly connected to it. Normally, Host B 
connects to only a single gateway. However, in some circumstances, a host connects to 
a segment that has two or more directly connected routers. In this case, the host’s 
default gateway might need to use a redirect/change request to inform the host of the 
best path to a certain network. 
Default gateways send ICMP redirects/change requests only if the following conditions 
are met:
■The interface on which the packet comes into the router is the same interface on 
which the packet gets routed out. 
■The subnet/network of the source IP address is the same subnet/network of the 
next-hop IP address of the routed packet.
■The datagram is not source-routed (that is, it is not routed from the place from 
which the data is taken).
■The route for the redirect is not another ICMP redirect or a default route.
■The router is conﬁgured to send redirects. By default, Cisco routers send ICMP 
redirects. The interface subcommand no ip redirects disables ICMP redirects. 
The ICMP redirect/change request uses the format shown in Figure 17-11. The request 
has an ICMP type code of 5. In addition, the request has a code value of 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
The meanings of these code values with their required actions are shown in Table 17-5.

Figure 17-11 Redirect Request Message Format
The receiver of the redirect should use the gateway Internet address in the ICMP redirect 
as the router IP address when forwarding packets for a particular network. In the exam-
ple shown in Figure 17-10, the ICMP redirect sent from Router A to Host B would have 
a gateway Internet address of 192.168.12.2, which is the IP address of Router B. 
Clock Synchronization and Transit Time Estimation
The TCP/IP protocol suite allows systems to connect to one another over vast distances 
through multiple networks. Each individual network provides clock synchronization 
in its own way. This can result in problems when hosts on different networks try to 
communicate using software that requires time synchronization. The ICMP timestamp 
message type is designed to help reduce this problem.
The ICMP timestamp request message allows a host to ask for a remote host’s current 
time. The remote host uses an ICMP timestamp reply message to respond to the 
request. Figure 17-12 shows the format for an ICMP timestamp request or reply.

Chapter 17: TCP/IP Error and Control Messages
The Type ﬁeld on an ICMP timestamp message can be either 13 for a timestamp request 
or 14 for a timestamp reply. The Code ﬁeld value is always set to 0 because no addi-
tional parameters are available. The ICMP timestamp request contains an originate 
timestamp, which speciﬁes the time on the requesting host just before the timestamp 
request was sent. The receive timestamp is the time that the destination host received 
the ICMP timestamp request. The transmit timestamp is ﬁlled in just before the ICMP 
timestamp reply is returned. Originate, receive, and transmit timestamps are computed 
in milliseconds elapsed since midnight Universal Time (UT).
All ICMP timestamp reply messages contain the originate, receive, and transit time-
stamps. Using these three timestamps, the host that originated the ICMP timestamp 
request can estimate transit time across the network. By subtracting the originate time 
from the transit time, the host can try to guess its transit time. However, this is only a 
guess because the true transit time can vary widely, depending on trafﬁc and conges-
tion on the network. Also, using these three timestamps, the host that originated the 
ICMP timestamp request can estimate the local time of the remote computer.
ICMP timestamp messages provide a simple way of estimating time on a remote host 
and the total network transit time. However, this is not the best way to obtain this 
information. Instead, protocols such as the Network Time Protocol (NTP), at the 
higher layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack, perform clock synchronization in a more 
reliable manner.
Information Requests and Reply Message Formats
The ICMP information requests and reply messages originally were intended to enable 
a host to determine the number of the network that it occupied. Figure 17-13 shows 
the format for an ICMP information request and reply message. 
Figure 17-13 Information Request and Reply Message Format
Two type codes are available in this message. Type 15 code signiﬁes an information 
request message. Type 16 code identiﬁes an information reply message. This particular 
ICMP message type is considered obsolete. Other protocols, such as BOOTP and

Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP), now are used to allow hosts to obtain 
their network numbers to which they are attached.
Address Mask Requests
When a network administrator uses the process of subnetting to divide a major IP 
address into multiple subnets, a new subnet mask is created. This new subnet mask is 
crucial in identifying network, subnet, and host bits in an IP address. If a host does not 
know the subnet mask, it might send an address mask request to the local router. If the 
address of the router is known, this request can be sent as unicast. If the address is not 
known, this request is sent using broadcast. When the router receives the request, it 
responds with an address mask reply. This address mask reply identiﬁes the correct 
subnet mask. For example, assume that a host is located within a Class B network and 
has an IP address of 172.16.5.3. This host does not know the subnet mask, so it 
broadcasts an address mask request:
Source address       172.16.5.3
Destination address  255.255.255.255
Protocol             ICMP = 1
Type                 Address Mask Request = AM1
Code                 0
Mask                 0
This broadcast is received by 168.5.5.1, the local router. That router responds with the 
address mask reply:
Source address        172.16.5.1
Destination address  172.16.5.3
Protocol             ICMP = 1
Type                 Address Mask Reply = AM2
Code                 0
Mask                 255.255.255.0
Figure 17-14 shows the frame format for the address mask request. Table 17-6 lists the 
ICMP address mask request messages. Notice that the same frame format is used for 
both the address mask request and the reply. However, an ICMP type number of 17 is 
assigned to the request, and 18 is assigned to the reply.

Chapter 17: TCP/IP Error and Control Messages
Router-Discovery Message
The host can learn the available routers through the process of router discovery when 
the host has not been manually conﬁgured with a default gateway. This process begins 
with the host sending a multicast router-solicitation message to all routers, using the 
address 224.0.0.2. Figure 17-15 shows the ICMP router-solicitation message. This 
router solicitation also can be sent using broadcast to include routers that might not 
be conﬁgured for multicasting. RFC 1812 indicates that routers should be capable of 
supporting the router-discovery process for all the networks that are directly connected.

A 32-bit mask. A gateway receiving an address mask request 
should return it with the Address Mask ﬁeld set to the 32-bit 
mask of the bits identifying the subnet and the network for 
the subnet on which the request was received. If the request-
ing host does not know its own IP address, it can leave the 
source ﬁeld 0; the reply then should be broadcast. However, 
this approach should be avoided if at all possible because it 
increases the superﬂuous broadcast lead on the network. Even 
when the replies are broadcast, there is no need to match 
requests with replies because there is only one possible address 
mask for a subnet. The Identiﬁer and Sequence Number ﬁelds 
can be ignored. Type AM1 can be received from a gateway or 
host. Type AM2 can be received from a gateway, or a host 
acting in lieu of a gateway.

However, this support is not always the case. If a router-solicitation message is sent to a 
router that does not support the discovery process, the solicitation will go unanswered.

Router-Solicitation Message
A host generates an ICMP router-solicitation message in response to a missing default 
gateway. This message is sent using multicast. This message is the ﬁrst step in the router-
discovery process. A local router responds with a router advertisement identifying the 
default gateway for the local host.

ﬁeld.

Congestion and Flow-Control Messages
If multiple computers try to access the same receiver, the receiver can be overcome 
with trafﬁc. Congestion also can occur when trafﬁc from a high-speed LAN reaches a 
slower WAN connection. Congestion on the network or the receiver causes dropped 
packets, which results in a loss of data. To reduce the amount of data lost, ICMP mes-
sages must be sent to the source of the congestion. This type of ICMP message is called 
a source quench message. The source quench message notiﬁes the sender of the conges-
tion and asks the sender to reduce the rate at which it is transmitting packets. In most 
cases, congestion subsides after a short period of time. The source slowly increases the 
transmission rate as long as no other source quench messages are received. Most Cisco 
routers do not send source quench messages by default. This is because the source 
quench message might, in itself, add to the network congestion.

Summary
781
ICMP source quench message might be used effectively in a small ofﬁce, home ofﬁce 
(SOHO). One such SOHO could consist of four computers networked together using 
Category 5 cable and Internet connection sharing (ICS) over a 56-kbps modem. It is 
easy to see that the 10-Mbps bandwidth of the SOHO LAN easily could overwhelm 
the available 56-kbps bandwidth of the WAN link. This could result in data loss and 
retransmissions. With ICMP messaging, the host acting as the gateway in the ICS can 
request that the other hosts reduce their transmission rates to a manageable level. 
Reducing the transmission rates prevents continued data loss.
Summary
These key points were discussed in this chapter:
■IP is a best-effort delivery method that uses ICMP messages to alert the sender 
that the data did not reach its destination.
■ICMP echo request and echo reply messages enable the network administrator 
to test IP connectivity to aid in the troubleshooting process.
■ICMP messages are transmitted using the IP protocol, so their delivery is 
unreliable.
■ICMP packets have their own special header information, starting with a 
Type ﬁeld and a Code ﬁeld.
■Functions of ICMP control messages.
■ICMP redirect/change request messages.
■ICMP clock synchronization and transit time estimation messages.
■ICMP information request and reply messages.
■ICMP address mask request and reply messages.
■ICMP router-discovery message.
■ICMP router-solicitation message.
■ICMP congestion and ﬂow-control messages.

Basic Router Troubleshooting
This chapter provides an overview of network testing and emphasizes the necessity of 
using a structured approach to troubleshooting. This chapter also describes the funda-
mentals of troubleshooting routers.
Please be sure to look at this chapter’s associated e-Labs, movies, and PhotoZooms that

Introduction to Network Testing
Basic testing of a network should proceed in sequence from one OSI reference model 
layer to the next, as shown in Figure 18-1. 
Figure 18-1 Testing Utilities and the OSI Reference Model
It is best to begin with Layer 1 and work to Layer 7, if necessary. Beginning with Layer 1, 
look for simple problems such as power cords unplugged at the wall.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
Layer 2 issues can include improperly conﬁgured serial or Ethernet interfaces, improper 
clock rate settings on serial interfaces, or network interface card (NIC) problems. 
The most common problems that occur on IP networks result from errors in the 
addressing scheme, which are Layer 3 issues. 
The various problems that can occur at all the layers of the OSI model are covered in 
detail later in this chapter. It is important to test the address conﬁguration before con-
tinuing with further conﬁguration steps. 
Each test presented in this section focuses on network operations at a speciﬁc layer of 
the OSI model. 
Structured Approach to Troubleshooting
Troubleshooting is a process that helps a user to ﬁnd problems on a network. An orderly 
process to troubleshooting should be used, based on the networking standards set in 
place by an administration. Documentation is a very important part of the trouble-
shooting process. The ﬂowchart in Figure 18-2 shows a recommended logical sequence 
for troubleshooting network problems.

Figure 18-3 shows one approach to troubleshooting network problems. 
Figure 18-3 OSI Layer Troubleshooting
With a structured approach, members of the network know what each member has 
completed to solve a problem. If a variety of ideas are used without any organization, 
the problem solving becomes chaotic. Without a structured approach, very few prob-
lems are solved.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
The ﬂowcharts in Figure 18-2 and Figure 18-3 are not the only methods of trouble-
shooting; however, the orderly process is very important to ensure that a network runs 
smoothly and efﬁciently.
Testing by OSI Layers
Testing should begin with Layer 1 of the OSI model and work to Layer 7, if necessary. 
Layer 1 (physical layer) errors can include the following: 
 
■Broken cables 
 
■Disconnected cables 
 
■Cables connected to the wrong ports 
 
■Intermittent cable connection 
 
■Wrong cables used for the task at hand (must use rollovers, crossover cables, 
and straight-through cables correctly) 
 
■Transceiver problems 
 
■Data communications equipment (DCE) cable problems 
 
■Data terminal equipment (DTE) cable problems 
 
■Devices turned off
After exhausting all Layer 1 problems as possibilities for a network problem, the 
next step is to investigate Layer 2 problem possibilities.
Layer 2 errors can include the following: 
 
■Improperly conﬁgured serial interfaces 
 
■Improperly conﬁgured Ethernet interfaces 
 
■Improper encapsulation set (High-Level Data Link Control [HDLC] is default 
for serial interfaces) 
 
■Improper clock rate settings on serial interfaces
 
■Network interface card (NIC) problems
After exhausting all Layer 2 problems as possibilities for a network problem, the next 
step is to investigate Layer 3 problem possibilities.
Layer 3 errors can include the following: 
 
■Routing protocol not enabled 
 
■Wrong routing protocol enabled
 
■Routing protocol incorrectly conﬁgured 
 
■Incorrect IP addresses

■Incorrect subnet masks
 
■Incorrect default gateway 
If errors or problems related to connectivity appear on the network, testing through 
the layers using connectivity tools, such as ping or telnet, should be the ﬁrst step in 
determining the point in the network where the packet gets dropped. The ping com-
mand can be used at Layer 3 to test connectivity. At Layer 7, the telnet command can 
be used to verify the application layer software between source and destination stations. 
Both of these commands are discussed in detail later in the chapter.
Troubleshooting Layer 1 Using Indicators
Indicators are useful tools for troubleshooting. Most interfaces or NICs have indicator 
lights that show whether there is a valid connection. This light usually is referred to as 
the link light. The interface also might have lights to indicate whether trafﬁc is being 
sent (TX) or received (RX). If the interface has indicator lights that do not show a 
valid connection, power off the device and reset the interface card. The NIC functions 
at both Layers 1 and 2. 
Many indicators are considered Layer 1 problems in a network, including the following: 
 
■Broken cables 
 
■Disconnected cables 
 
■Cables connected to the wrong ports 
 
■Intermittent cable connection 
 
■Wrong cables used for the task at hand 
 
■Transceiver problems 
 
■Devices turned off
A faulty or incorrect cable could result in a link light indicating a bad connection or 
no link.
Check to make sure that all cables are connected to the appropriate ports. Make sure 
that all cross-connects are patched properly to the correct location using the appropri-
ate cable and method. Verify that all switch or hub ports are set in the correct VLAN 
or collision domain, and have appropriate options set for Spanning Tree and other 
considerations.
Verify that the proper cable is being used. If a direct connection exists between two 
end systems—for example, between a PC and a router or between two switches—a 
special crossover cable might be required. Verify that the cable from the source interface 
 
chpt_18.fm  Page 791  Tuesday, May 27, 2003  2:19 PM

792
Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
is connected properly and is in good condition. If it does not seem to be a good con-
nection, reset the cable and ensure that the connection is secure. Try replacing the 
cable with a known working cable. If the cable connects to a wall jack, use a cable 
tester to ensure that the jack is wired properly.
Also check any transceiver in use to ensure that it is the correct type and is properly 
connected and conﬁgured. If replacing the cable does not resolve the problem, try 
replacing the transceiver, if one is being used.
Before you run diagnostics or attempt complex troubleshooting, always check to make 
sure that the device is powered on. Some problems result from the simplest of errors. 
Troubleshooting Layer 2 Using the show interface Command 
The show interface command is perhaps the single most important tool to discover 
Layer 1 and Layer 2 problems with the router. The ﬁrst output parameter, or line, refers 
to the physical layer. The second parameter, or protocol, indicates whether Cisco IOS 
Software processes that control the line protocol consider the interface usable. This is 
determined by whether keepalives successfully are received. If the interface misses 
three consecutive keepalives, the line protocol is marked as down.
If the line is down, the protocol also must be down. This is because there would be no 
usable media for the protocol. This occurs when the interface is down because of a 
hardware issue or if it is “administratively down” because of a conﬁguration issue.
If the interface is up and the line protocol is down, a Layer 2 problem exists. The 
following list contains some possible causes:
 
■No keepalives
 
■No clock rate 
 
■Mismatch in encapsulation type
These problems can be determined when the show interface command has been 
entered and a line appears stating, “interface is up and the line protocol is down.” 
Using the clockrate command or the encapsulation command, verify that that there is 
no mismatch between interfaces. 
The show interfaces serial command should be used after conﬁguring a serial interface, 
to verify the changes and ensure that the interface is operational.

Introduction to Network Testing
793
Troubleshooting Layer 3 Using ping
The ping utility is used to test network connectivity. To aid in diagnosing basic net-
work connectivity, many network protocols support an echo protocol, which is used 
to test whether protocol packets are being routed. The ping command sends a packet to 
the destination host and then waits for a reply packet from that host. Results from this 
echo protocol can help evaluate the path-to-host reliability, delays over the path, and 
whether the host can be reached or is functioning. The ping output displays the mini-
mum, average, and maximum times that it takes for a ping packet to ﬁnd a speciﬁed 
system and return. ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to verify 
the hardware connection and the logical address of the network layer. This is a basic 
testing mechanism.
For the network in Figure 18-4, the ping target 172.16.1.5 responded successfully to 
all ﬁve datagrams sent, as shown in Example 18-1. 
Figure 18-4 Network for Testing with ping
The exclamation points (!) indicate each successful echo. If any periods (.) instead of 
exclamations are received on a display, the application on the router timed out waiting 
for a given packet echo from the ping target. The ping command can be used to diag-
nose basic network connectivity.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
ping tests network connections by sending ICMP echo requests to a target host and 
waiting for replies. When testing a connection, ping tracks the number of packets sent, 
the number of replies received, the percentage of packets lost, and the amount of time 
required for the packets to reach the destination and for replies to be received. This 
information enables users to verify whether their workstations can communicate with 
other hosts, and they can determine whether any information was lost. 
The ping command can be initiated from both user EXEC mode and privileged EXEC 
mode. The ping command can be used to conﬁrm basic network connectivity on 
AppleTalk, ISO Connectionless Network Service (CLNS), IP, Novell, Apollo, VINES, 
DECnet, or XNS networks.
ICMP uses messages to accomplish various tasks. Table 18-1 shows a list of ICMP 
message types.
Table 18-1 CMP Message Types 
Message
Purpose
Destination unreachable
This tells the source host that there is a prob-
lem delivering a packet.
Time exceeded
The time that it takes a packet to be delivered 
has been too long, and the packet has been 
discarded.
Source quench
The source is sending data faster than it can 
be forwarded. This message requests that the 
sender slow down.
Redirect
The router sending this message has received 
some packet for which another router would 
have had a better route. The message tells the 
sender to use the better route.
Echo
This is used by the ping command to verify 
connectivity.
Parameter problem
This is used to identify a parameter that is 
incorrect.
Timestamp
This is used to measure round-trip time to 
particular hosts.

Introduction to Network Testing

The extended command mode of the ping command permits users to specify the sup-
ported IP header options. This allows the router to perform a more extensive range of 
test options. To enter ping extended command mode, type the ping command with no 
options in privileged mode and press Enter. You are prompted for some basic options 
as well as the Extended Commands option. Enter yes at the Extended commands prompt 
to specify various extended ping options. An extended ping works the same way as a 
regular ping, but it supports the manipulation of some different parameters, such as 
packet size and frequency. 
It is a good idea to use the ping command when the network is functioning properly, to 
see how the command works under normal conditions and so that you have something 
to compare against when troubleshooting.
Troubleshooting Layer 3 Issues Using traceroute
The traceroute command is used to discover the routes that packets take when traveling 
to their destinations. traceroute also can be used to test the network layer, or Layer 3, 
on a hop-by-hop basis and to provide performance benchmarks.
The output of the traceroute command generates a list of hops that successfully were 
reached, as shown in Example 18-2. If the data successfully reaches the intended desti-
nation, then the output indicates every router that the datagram passes through. This 
output can be captured and used for future troubleshooting of the internetwork. 
Address mask request/reply
This is used to inquire about and learn the 
correct subnet mask to be used.
Router advertisement and selection
This is used to allow hosts to dynamically 
learn the IP addresses of the routers attached 
to the subnet.
Example 18-2 traceroute Command Output 
Cougars> traceroute 168.71.8.2

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
traceroute output also indicates the speciﬁc hop at which the failure is occurring. For 
each router in the path, a line of output is generated on the terminal indicating the IP 
address of the interface that the data entered. If an asterisk (*) appears, the packet 
failed. You can isolate the problem area by obtaining the last good hop from the trace-
route output and comparing it to a diagram of the internetwork. 
traceroute also provides information indicating the relative performance of links. The 
round-trip time (RTT) is the time required to send an echo packet and get a response, 
as shown in Example 18-2. In this example, each of the three packets sent has an RTT 
of 3 milliseconds (ms). This is useful for an approximate idea of the delay on the link. 
These ﬁgures are not precise enough to be used for an accurate performance evaluation; 
however, this output can be captured and used for future performance troubleshooting 
of the internetwork. 
The device receiving the traceroute also must know how to send the reply back to 
the source of the traceroute. For the traceroute or ping data to successfully make the 
round trips between routers, there must be known routes in both directions. A failed 
response is not always an indication of a problem because ICMP messages could be 
rate-limited or ﬁltered at the host site. This is especially true across the Internet. 
traceroute sends out a sequence of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams from the 
router to an invalid port address on the remote host. For the ﬁrst sequence of three 
datagrams sent, a Time-To-Live (TTL) ﬁeld value is set to 1. The TTL value of 1 causes 
the datagram to time out at the ﬁrst router in the path. This router then responds with 
an ICMP time exceeded message (TEM) indicating that the datagram has expired.
Three more UDP messages now are sent, each with the TTL value set to 2. This causes 
the second router to return ICMP TEMs. This process continues until the packets 
reach the other destination. 
Because these datagrams are trying to access an invalid port at the destination host, 
ICMP port unreachable messages are returned instead of ICMP TEMs. This indicates 
an unreachable port and signals the traceroute program, terminating the process.

Troubleshooting Layer 7 Using Telnet
Telnet is a virtual terminal protocol that is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Telnet 
allows the veriﬁcation of the application layer software between source and destination 
stations. This is the most complete test mechanism available. Telnet allows connections 
to be made to remote devices, to gather information and run commands and applications.
Telnet is the most complete testing tool because it uses IP at the network layer and 
TCP at the transport layer to create a session with a remote host. If Telnet is successful, 
IP connectivity must be good.
The telnet command provides a virtual terminal so that administrators can use Telnet 
operations to connect with other network devices (such as routers and switches) run-
ning TCP/IP. If a router can be remotely accessed using Telnet, at least one TCP/IP 
application can reach the remote router. A successful Telnet connection indicates that 
the upper-layer application and the services of lower layers are functioning properly. 
Figure 18-5 illustrates a Telnet connection.
Figure 18-5 Using Telnet
If an administrator can Telnet to one router but not to another router, the Telnet fail-
ure likely is caused by speciﬁc addressing, naming, or access permission problems. These 
problems can exist on the administrator’s router or on the router that failed as a Telnet 
target.
If the Telnet to a particular server fails from one host, try connecting from a router and 
several other devices. Also try using ping as a more basic test. If you can ping the host, 
but cannot achieve a login prompt when trying to Telnet, check the following:
■Can a reverse DNS lookup on the client’s address be found? Many Telnet servers 
do not allow connections from IP addresses that have no DNS entry. This is a 
common problem for DHCP-assigned addresses in which the administrator has 
not added DNS entries for the DHCP pools.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
■A Telnet application might not be capable of negotiating the appropriate options 
and, therefore, will not connect. On a Cisco router, this negotiation process can 
be viewed using debug telnet. Look for error messages or invalid IP or DNS 
address, which would indicate this problem.
■It is possible that Telnet is disabled or has been moved to a port other than 23 on 
the destination server. Recall that port 23 is the default port for Telnet. 
Troubleshooting Router Issues Using the show 
interface and show interfaces Commands
Cisco IOS Software contains numerous commands for troubleshooting. Among the 
more widely used are the show commands. Every aspect of the router can be viewed 
with one or more of the show commands. The show interface command is used to 
check the status and statistics of the interfaces. Variations of this command can be 
used to check the status of the different types of interfaces. To view the status of the 
FastEthernet interfaces, use show interfaces fastethernet. This command also can be 
used to view the status of one particular interface. To view the status of the Serial 0/0 
interface, use show interface serial0/0. To view the status of FastEthernet 0/0, use 
show interface fa0/0.
The show interfaces command displays the status of two important portions of the 
interfaces. These can be related to the Layer 1 and the Layer 2 functions:
■Physical (hardware) portion—The hardware includes cables, connectors, and 
interfaces showing the condition of the physical connection between the devices. 
■Logical (software) portion—The software status shows the state of messages 
such as keepalives, control information, and user information that are passed 
between adjacent devices. This relates to the condition of a data link layer 
protocol passed between two connected neighboring router interfaces.
These important elements of the show interface serial command output are displayed 
as the line and data-link protocol status shown in Example 18-3.

Troubleshooting Router Issues Using the show interface and show interfaces Commands
799
The ﬁrst parameter (Serial0 is up) refers to the hardware layer and essentially reﬂects 
whether the interface is receiving the carrier detect signal from the other end (DCE). If 
the line is down, a problem with the cabling might exist in a back-to-back connection, 
with one end being “administratively down.” If the interface is administratively down, 
it has been disabled manually in the conﬁguration. 
The show interfaces serial command also provides information to help diagnose other 
Layer 1 issues that are not as easy to determine.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
The following problems can be caused by an increasing number of carrier transitions 
counts on a serial link:
■Line interruptions from the service provider network
■Faulty switch, DSU, or router hardware
If an increasing number of input errors appear in the show interfaces serial output, sev-
eral possible sources of those errors exist. Some common problems related to Layer 1 are
as follows:
■Faulty telephone company equipment 
■Noisy serial line 
■Incorrect cable or cable length 
■Damaged cable or connection 
■Defective CSU or DSU 
■Defective router hardware 
Another area to examine is the number of interface resets. Interface resets are the 
result of too many missed keepalives. Layer 1 problems also could be caused by 
the following: 
■Bad phone line causing CD transitions 
■Possible hardware problem at the CSU, DSU, or switch
The number of errors should be interpreted relative to the amount of trafﬁc that the 
router has processed and the length of time that the statistics have been captured. 
The router tracks statistics that provide information about the interface. The statistics 
reﬂect router operation since it was started or since the last time the counters were 
cleared, as shown in Example 18-4.

If the show interfaces output shows the last clearing of the counters as never, use the 
show version command to determine how long the router has been functional, as 
shown in Example 18-5.
Use the clear counters command, as shown in Example 18-6, to reset the counters to 0. 
These counters always should be cleared after an interface problem has been corrected. 
Starting from 0 gives a better picture of the current status of the network and helps 
verify that the issue has been corrected.

The output from the show cdp neighbors command displays information about 
directly connected neighbors, as demonstrated in Example 18-7. 
This information is useful for debugging connectivity issues. If a cabling problem is 
suspected, enable the interfaces with the no shutdown command and then execute the 
show cdp neighbor detail command, as shown in Example 18-8, before any other con-
ﬁguration. The command displays speciﬁc device detail such as the active interfaces, 
the port ID, and the device.
If the physical layer is functioning properly, all other directly connected Cisco devices 
should be displayed. If a known device does not show up, there is probably a Layer 1 
issue.
One area of concern with CDP is security. The amount of information that CDP pro-
vides is so extensive that it can be a potential security risk. For security reasons, CDP 
should be conﬁgured only on links between Cisco devices and should be disabled on 
user ports or links that are not managed locally.

Troubleshooting Routing Issues Using show ip route and show ip protocol
803
Troubleshooting Routing Issues Using show ip route 
and show ip protocol 
The show ip protocol and show ip route commands display information about routing 
protocols and the routing table. The output from these commands can be used to ver-
ify the routing protocol conﬁguration. 
The show ip route command is perhaps the single most important command for trouble-
shooting routing issues. This command displays the contents of the IP routing table. 
The output in Example 18-9 shows the entries for all known networks and subnet-
works and how the information was obtained. 
If there is a problem reaching a host in a particular network, the output of the show ip 
route command can be used to verify that the router has a route to that network.
If the output of the show ip route command does not show the expected learned routes 
or shows no learned routes, the problem is possibly that routing information is not being 
exchanged. In this case, use show ip protocols commands, as shown in Example 18-10, 
on the router to check for a routing protocol conﬁguration error.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
The show ip protocols command displays values about IP routing protocol informa-
tion on the entire router. This command can be used to conﬁrm which protocols are 
conﬁgured, which networks are being advertised, which interfaces are sending updates, 
and the sources of routing updates. The show ip protocols output also displays the 
routing parameters about timers, ﬁlters, and other information related to the routing 
protocol. When multiple routing protocols are conﬁgured, the information about each 
protocol is listed in a separate section. 
The show ip protocols command output can be used to diagnose many routing issues, 
such as identifying a router that is suspected of delivering bad router information. The 
command output also can be used to conﬁrm that the expected protocols, advertised

identifying the problem is difﬁcult, if not impossible, if there is no documentation indi-
cating the expected results.

Troubleshooting Router Connections Using the 
show controllers serial Command
Router conﬁguration and troubleshooting frequently are done remotely. Therefore, it 
is not possible to physically inspect the router connections. The show controllers serial
command, shown in Example 18-11, is used to determine the type of cable connected 
without inspecting the cables. 
Lab Activity
Troubleshooting Routing Issues with show ip route and 
show ip protocol
In this lab, you use the show ip route and show ip protocol commands to 
diagnose a routing conﬁguration problem.
Lab Activity
Gateway of Last Resort (Default Gateway)
In this lab, you conﬁgure RIP routing and add default routes (gateways) to the 
routers. You remove RIP and the default routes, then conﬁgure IGRP routing 
and add default routes (gateways) to the routers again.
Lab Activity
Last Route Update
In this lab, you gather information about routing updates and routing proto-
cols to determine the most recent routing table updates.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
Being able to determine the type of cable that the controller detects is useful for ﬁnding 
a serial interface with no cable, the wrong type of cable, or a defective cable. 
The show controllers serial command queries the integrated circuit, or chip, that con-
trols the serial interfaces and displays information about the physical interface. This 
output varies among controller chips. Even within a router type, different controller 
chips can be used. 
Regardless of the controller type, the show controllers serial command produces a tre-
mendous amount of output. Other than the cable type, most of this output is internal 
technical detail regarding the controller chip status. Without speciﬁc knowledge of the 
integrated circuit, this information is not useful. 
Introduction to debug
The debug commands assist in the isolation of protocol and conﬁguration problems. 
The debug command is used to display dynamic data and events. Because the show
commands display only static information, they provide a historical picture of the router 
operation. The debug command output provides more insight into the current events 
of the router. These events include trafﬁc on an interface, error messages generated by 
nodes on the network, protocol-speciﬁc diagnostic packets, and other useful trouble-
shooting data. Example 18-12 shows sample output from the debug ip rip command.
Example 18-12 debug ip rip Command
Router# debug ip rip
RIP Protocol debugging is on
Router#
RIP:     received update from 183.8.128.130 on Serial0
183.8.0.128 in 1 hops

0.0.0.0 in 16 hops (inaccessible)
RIP:     received update from 183.8.64.140 on Seria11

Introduction to debug
807
The highlighted material in Example 18-12 shows that RIP debugging has been turned 
on and shows which routes, networks, and interfaces are accessible and inaccessible.
The dynamic output of the debug command comes at a performance cost, which pro-
duces high processor overhead that can disrupt normal router operation. For this reason, 
you should use it conservatively. Use debug commands to examine speciﬁc types of 
trafﬁc or concerns after problems have been narrowed to a few possible causes. In 
other words, debug commands should be used to isolate speciﬁc problems, not to 
monitor normal network operation. 
By default, the router sends the debug output and system messages to the console. If a 
Telnet session is being used to examine the router, the debug output and system mes-
sages can be redirected to the remote terminal. This is done through the Telnet session 
by issuing the terminal monitor command. Use extra caution when selecting the debug
commands from a Telnet session. No command should be selected that will cause the 
debug output to create additional trafﬁc. If this occurs, the Telnet session rapidly saturates 
the link with trafﬁc, or the router exhausts one or more resources. A good rule to fol-
low to prevent this production of trafﬁc is to never debug any activity on the port 
where the session is established.
The output of the different debug commands varies. Some frequently generate many 
lines, while others output a line or two every few minutes. Example 18-13 shows the 
debug ip packet detail command.
0.0.0.0 in 16 hops (inaccessible)
RIP:     sending update to 255.255.255.255 via Ethernet0 (183.8.128.2)
subnet 183.8.0.128, metric 2

network 183.8.0.0, metric 1
Example 18-12 debug ip rip Command (Continued)
NOTE
The debug all com-
mand, in particular, 
should be used spar-
ingly because it 
can disrupt router 
operations.

Chapter 18: Basic Router Troubleshooting
The highlighted material in the previous example indicates what networks are involved 
and shows access being denied from packets into or out of 210.107.197.105.
Another Cisco IOS Software service that enhances the usefulness of the debug output
is the timestamps command. This command puts a timestamp on a debug message. 
This information provides the time when the debug event occurred and the duration of 
time between events. The service timestamps debug uptime command can provide the 
hour:minute:second of the output, determine the amount of time since the router was 
last powered up, or identify when a reload command was executed.

Summary
809
The no debug all command and undebug all command turn off all diagnostic output. 
To disable a particular debug command, use the no form of the command. For example, 
if debug for monitoring RIP was enabled with the command debug ip rip, it can be 
disabled with no debug ip rip. To view what is currently being examined by a debug
command, use show debugging.

Chapter 19
Intermediate TCP
In this chapter, you learn about TCP/IP operation to ensure communication across any 
set of interconnected networks. In addition, you learn about the TCP/IP protocol stack 
components, such as protocols to support ﬁle transfer, e-mail, remote login, and other 
applications. You learn about reliable and unreliable transport layer protocols and about 
connectionless datagram (packet) delivery at the network layer. Finally, you learn how 
ARP and RARP work.
Please be sure to look at the e-Labs, Videos, and PhotoZooms associated with this chap-
ter that you will ﬁnd on the CD-ROM accompanying this book. These CD elements are 
designed to supplement the material and reinforce the concepts introduced in this chapter.
The TCP/IP Protocol Suite
The TCP/IP suite of protocols was developed as part of the research done by the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). It was originally developed to provide 
communication within DARPA. Later, TCP/IP was included with the Berkeley Software 
Distribution of UNIX. Now, TCP/IP is the de facto standard for internetwork communi-
cations and serves as the transport protocol stack for the Internet, enabling millions of 
computers to communicate globally. This chapter focuses on TCP/IP for several reasons:
■TCP/IP is a universally available protocol that you likely use at work.
■TCP/IP is a useful reference for understanding other protocols because it includes 
elements that are representative of other protocols.
■TCP/IP is important because the router uses it as a conﬁguration tool.
The function of the TCP/IP protocol stack is to transfer information from one network 
device to another. In doing so, it closely maps the OSI reference model in the lower layers 
and supports all standard physical and data link protocols (see Figure 19-1).

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
Figure 19-1 Four Layer Model of TCP/IP
The OSI layers most closely related to TCP/IP are Layer 7 (application layer), Layer 4 
(transport layer), and Layer 3 (network layer). Included in these layers are various 
types of protocols with a variety of purposes/functions, all of which are related to the 
transfer of information. The TCP/IP layers map quite well to the OSI model: TCP (at 
the transport or host-to-host layer) maps to the OSI transport layer, and the Internet 
layer maps to the OSI network layer.
TCP/IP enables communication among any set of interconnected networks and is 
equally well suited for both LAN and WAN communication. TCP/IP includes not only 
Layer 3 and 4 speciﬁcations (such as IP and TCP), but also speciﬁcations to support 
such common applications as e-mail, remote login, terminal emulation, and ﬁle transfer.
TCP/IP Protocol Stack and the Application Layer
The application layer of the TCP/IP or Internet protocols combines the functionality 
found in the OSI session, presentation, and application layers. TCP/IP has protocols to 
support ﬁle transfer, e-mail, and remote login, including the following (see Figure 19-2):
■Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used on the Internet for translating 
names of domains and their publicly advertised network nodes into IP addresses.
This translation is considered to be transport layer functionality because it pro-
vides services to the layer above (application layer) and receives services from the 
layer below (Internetwork layer).
■Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) is a Microsoft-developed standard for 
Microsoft Windows NT that automatically associates NT workstations with 
Internet domain names.

■HOSTS is a ﬁle created by network administrators and maintained on servers. 
The ﬁle is used to provide static mappings between IP addresses and computer 
names.
■Post Ofﬁce Protocol (POP3) is an Internet standard for storing e-mail on a mail 
server until you can access it and download it to your computer. It enables users 
to receive mail from their inboxes using various levels of security.
■Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) governs the transmission of e-mail over 
computer networks. It does not provide support for transmission of data other 
than plain text.
■Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a protocol that provides a 
means to monitor and control network devices and to manage conﬁgurations, 
statistics collection, performance, and security.
■File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a reliable, connection-oriented service that uses 
TCP to transfer ﬁles between systems that support FTP. It supports bidirectional 
binary ﬁle and ASCII ﬁle transfers.
■Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a connectionless service that uses UDP. 
TFTP is used on the router to transfer conﬁguration ﬁles and IOS images, and to 
transfer ﬁles between systems that support TFTP. It is useful in some LANs 
because it operates faster than FTP in a stable environment.
■Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the Internet standard that supports the 
exchange of information on the World Wide Web as well as on internal net-
works. It supports many different ﬁle types, including text, graphics, sound, and 
video. It deﬁnes the process by which web browsers originate requests for infor-
mation to send to web servers.

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
The following list provides an overview of some troubleshooting protocols:
■Telnet is a standard terminal emulation protocol used by clients to make remote 
terminal connections to Telnet server services. It enables users to remotely con-
nect to routers to enter conﬁguration commands.
■Packet Internet Groper (ping) determines whether a computer is reachable. ping 
uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request and reply 
messages.
■The traceroute program is available on many systems and is similar to ping, 
except that traceroute provides more information than ping. traceroute traces the 
path that a packet takes to a destination and is used to debug routing problems.
You also need to be familiar with a few Windows-based utilities:
■NBSTAT—A utility used to troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution and used to 
view and remove entries from the name cache.
■NETSTAT—A utility that provides information about TCP/IP statistics; it can be 
used to provide information about the status of TCP/IP connections and summa-
ries of ICMP, TCP, and UDP.
■ipconﬁg/winipcfg—Utilities used to view current network settings for all net-
work interface cards (NICs) on a device; they can be used to view the MAC 
address, IP address, subnet mask, and gateway, as well as DNS and Dynamic 
Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) information.
TCP/IP Protocol Stack and the Transport Layer
This section introduces the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a Layer 4 protocol 
in the TCP/IP suite. TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that helps ensure 
reliable data delivery through the use of synchronization, windowing and window size, 
sequencing numbers, and acknowledgements (ACK).
The transport layer enables a user’s device to segment data from several upper-layer 
applications for placement on the same Layer 4 data stream and enables a receiving 
device to reassemble the upper-layer application segments. The Layer 4 data stream is 
a logical connection between the endpoints of a network; it provides transport services 
from a source host to a destination host. This service is sometimes referred to as an 
end-to-end service. The transport layer also provides two protocols (see Figure 19-3):
■TCP—A connection-oriented, reliable protocol that provides ﬂow control by 
providing sliding windows and offers reliability by providing sequence numbers 
and acknowledgments. TCP resends anything that is not acknowledged and sup-
plies a virtual circuit between end-user applications. The advantage of TCP is 
that it provides guaranteed delivery of segments.
1102.book  Page 818  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

The TCP/IP Protocol Suite
819
■User Datagram Protocol (UDP)—A connectionless and unreliable protocol that 
is responsible for transmitting messages but provides no software checking for 
segment delivery. The advantage that UDP provides is speed. Because UDP pro-
vides no acknowledgments, less control trafﬁc is sent across the network, making 
the transfer faster.
Figure 19-3 Transport Layer Protocols
TCP and UDP Segment Format
TCP is known as a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-oriented means that the 
end stations are aware of each other and are constantly communicating about the con-
nection. A classic example of a non-technical connection-oriented communication is a 
telephone conversation between two people. A good example of a connectionless con-
versation is the U.S. postal service where once you place the letter in the mail you hope 
that the mailing process gets the package delivered. Figure 19-4 illustrates the TCP seg-
ment header format, the ﬁeld deﬁnitions of which are described in the following list.

■Source port—The number of the source (port) for this segment.
■Destination port—The number of the destination (port) for this segment.
■Sequence number—The number used to ensure correct sequencing of the arriving 
data. It is the number assigned to the ﬁrst octet in the user data ﬁeld.
■Acknowledgment number—The next expected TCP octet.
■Header length—The number of 32-bit words in the header.
■Reserved—Set to 0.
■Code bits—The control functions (for example, setup and termination of a 
session).
■Window—The number of octets that the sender is willing to accept.
■Checksum—The calculated checksum of the header and data ﬁelds.
■Urgent—Indicator of the end of the urgent data.
■Options—One currently deﬁned: maximum TCP segment size.
■Data—Upper layer protocol data.
When using UDP, application layer protocols must provide for reliability if it is neces-
sary. UDP uses no windowing or acknowledgments. It is designed for applications that 
do not need to put sequences of segments together. Figure 19-5 shows the UDP header.

TCP Operation
IP addresses allow for the routing of packets between networks. However, IP makes no 
guarantees about delivery. The transport layer is responsible for the reliable transport 
and regulation of data ﬂow from source to destination. This reliability is accomplished 
by using sliding windows, sequencing numbers, and a synchronization process that 
ensures each host is ready and willing to communicate, as shown in Figure 19-6.

The TCP/IP Protocol Suite

To understand reliability and ﬂow control, think of two people engaged in a conversa-
tion. First, they meet and maybe shake hands to acknowledge to each other that a con-
versation is about to take place and information is about to be sent. While they are 
talking and exchanging information, if a word or phrase is inaudible or unreachable to 
the other person, one person might simply ask the person to repeat their words (for 
reliability) so he or she can catch the words (ﬂow control). The transport layer, Layer 4 
of the OSI model, provides these services to Layer 3 via TCP.
Three-Way Handshake
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Prior to data transmission the two communi-
cating hosts go through a synchronization process to establish a virtual connection. 
This synchronization process ensures that both sides are ready for data transmission 
and enables the devices to determine the initial sequence numbers (ISNs). This process 
is known as a three-way handshake.
Synchronization is accomplished by exchanging packets carrying the ISNs and a con-
trol bit called SYN, which stands for synchronize. (Packets carrying the SYN bit are 
also called SYNs.) Successful connection requires a suitable mechanism for choosing 
an initial sequence and a slightly involved handshake to exchange the ISNs. Synchroni-
zation requires that each side send its own ISN and receive a conﬁrmation and ISN 
from the other side of the connection.
Each side must receive the other side’s ISN and send a conﬁrming acknowledgment 
(ACK) in a speciﬁc order. A three-way handshake uses the following three-step process 
to establish a virtual connection between the two devices:
1. One host initiates a connection by sending a SYN packet indicating its initial 
sequence number of x with a certain bit in the header set to indicate a connection 
request. This bit is set in the code ﬁeld of the TCP header.
2. The other host receives the packet, records the sequence number of x, replies 
with an acknowledgment of x + 1, and includes its own initial sequence number 
of y. The acknowledgment number of x + 1 means the host has received all octets 
up to and including x and is expecting x + 1 next.
3. The initiating host responds with a simple acknowledgement (ACK) of y + 1 (the 
sequence number of the second host + 1), indicating it received the previous 
ACK, which ﬁnalizes the connection process.
Because the second and third steps are combined in a single message, the exchange is 
called a three-way handshake/open connection. As illustrated in Figure 19-7, both 
ends of a connection are synchronized with a three-way handshake/open connection 
sequence.

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
Figure 19-7 Three-Way Handshake
It is important to understand that sequence numbers are a part of initiating communi-
cation between the two devices. Sequence numbers act as reference starting numbers 
between the two devices. The sequence numbers give each host a way to ACK the 
SYN, so that the receiver knows the sender is responding to the proper connection 
request.
A three-way handshake is necessary because TCPs might use different mechanisms for 
picking the ISN. The receiver of the ﬁrst SYN has no way of knowing if the segment 
was an old delayed one unless it remembers the last sequence number used on the con-
nection, which is not always possible. So, it must ask the sender to verify this SYN. At 
this point, either side can begin communicating, and either side can break the commu-
nication because TCP is a peer-to-peer (balanced) communication method.
Denial-of-Service Attacks During Synchronization
Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are designed to deny services to legitimate hosts 
attempting to establish connections. DoS attacks are a common method that hackers 
utilize to halt system response. One type of DoS is known as SYN ﬂooding, which 
occurs during the three-way handshake synchronization process utilized by TCP.
During the three-way handshake, the initiating host sends a SYN packet. The SYN 
packet includes the source IP address and the destination IP address, just like any other 
packet. The recipient uses this source and destination address information to send the 
SYN/ACK packet back to the initiating device.
In a DoS attack, the hacker initiates a synchronization but falsiﬁes the source IP 
address. The receiving device replies to a non-existent, unreachable IP address and 
then is placed on hold while waiting to receive the ﬁnal ACK from the initiator. The 
waiting request is placed in a connection queue or a holding area in memory. This 
waiting state requires the attacked device to commit system resources, such as memory,

to the waiting process until the connection timer times out. Hackers ﬂood the attacked 
host with these false SYN requests, utilizing all of its connection resources to respond 
and wait for bogus connections, preventing it from responding to legitimate connec-
tion requests.
To defend against these attacks, administrators can decrease the connection timeout 
period and increase the connection queue size. Also, software is available that can 
detect these types of attacks and initiate defensive measures. Figure 19-8 shows a DoS 
attack during synchronization.
Figure 19-8 DoS Attack
Windowing and Window Size
In many instances, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted is too large to be 
sent in a single data segment. When this occurs, the data must be broken into smaller 
pieces to allow for proper data transmission. TCP is responsible for breaking data into 
segments. This process is similar to feeding a child. Because most small children cannot 
eat extremely large bites, the person feeding them often cuts their food into smaller 
pieces that their mouths can accommodate. Additionally, receiving machines might not 
be able to receive data as quickly as the source can send data. Sometimes discrepancy 
exists because the receiving device is busy with other tasks; other times the sender is 
simply a stronger device.
After the data is segmented, it must be transmitted to the destination device. One of the 
services provided by TCP is ﬂow control, which regulates how much data is sent dur-
ing a given transmission period. The process of ﬂow control is known as windowing.

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
Window size determines the amount of data that can be transmitted at one time before 
receiving an acknowledgment from the destination. After a host transmits the window-
sized number of bytes, the host must receive an acknowledgment that the data has 
been received before it can send any more messages. For example, with a window size 
of one, each individual segment must be acknowledged before the next segment can be 
sent as shown in Figure 19-9.
Figure 19-9 Window Size of 1
TCP utilizes a sliding window when determining transmission size. A sliding window 
enables devices to negotiate a window size to allow for more than one byte to be sent 
during a single transmission, as shown in Figure 19-10. This sliding window also 
enables the destination device to communicate with the source. The destination device, 
if it is incapable of dealing with that much data, can indicate a need to decrease the 
amount of data being sent. Conversely, the destination device can instruct the source 
to increase the amount of data being sent if it can process more data than is currently 
being sent.

Figure 19-10 Larger Window Size
Sequencing Numbers
TCP breaks data into segments. The data segments are then transported from sender 
to receiver. Data transportation follows the synchronization process and the negotia-
tion of a window size that dictates the number of bytes that can be transmitted at once. 
The data segments being transmitted must be reassembled once all of the data is received. 
No guarantee exists that the data will arrive in the order that it was transmitted, so 
TCP addresses this problem by using sequence numbers. TCP applies sequence num-
bers to the data segments it is transmitting so that the receiver will be able to properly 
reassemble the bytes in their original order. Sequencing numbers indicate to the desti-
nation device the correct order in which to put the bytes when they are received.
These sequencing numbers also act as reference numbers so that the receiver knows 
if it has received all of the data and can identify the missing data pieces to the sender 
so it can retransmit the missing data as shown in Figure 19-11. This feature offers 
increased efﬁciency because the sender is required to retransmit only the missing seg-
ments instead of retransmitting the entire set of data.

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
Figure 19-11 Sequence Acknowledgment Numbers
Each TCP segment is numbered before transmission. Figure 19-4 from earlier in the 
chapter showed the TCP segment format. Notice that the Sequence number portion 
follows the Destination port in the segment format. At the receiving station, TCP 
uses the sequence numbers to reassemble the segments into a complete message. If 
a sequence number is missing in the series, that segment is retransmitted.
Positive ACK
Acknowledgement is a common step in the synchronization process, sliding windows, 
and the sequencing of data. In a TCP segment, the Sequence number ﬁeld is followed 
by the Acknowledgement ﬁeld, also referred to as the Code ﬁeld. This ﬁeld is where 
ACKs and SYNs are indicated.
One problem with the unreliable IP protocol is that no veriﬁcation method exists in it 
for determining that data segments actually reached their destination. Therefore, data 
segments might be forwarded with no knowledge as to whether or not they were actu-
ally received. TCP utilizes positive acknowledgement and retransmission to control 
data ﬂow and conﬁrm data delivery.
Positive acknowledgment and retransmission (PAR) is a common technique many pro-
tocols use to provide reliability. With PAR, the source sends a packet, starts a timer, 
and waits for an acknowledgment before sending the next packet. If the timer expires 
before the source receives an acknowledgment, the source retransmits the packet and 
restarts the timer. TCP uses expectant acknowledgments in which the acknowledgment 
number refers to the next octet that is expected.
Windowing is a ﬂow control mechanism. During windowing, the source device is 
required to receive an acknowledgment from the destination after transmitting a cer-
tain amount of data. With a window size of three, the source device can send three

octets to the destination. It must then wait for an acknowledgment. If the destination 
receives the three octets, it sends an acknowledgment to the source device, which can 
now transmit three more octets. If the destination does not receive the three octets, due 
to overﬂowing buffers or some other reason, it does not send an acknowledgment. If 
the source does not receive an acknowledgment, it knows that the octets must be 
retransmitted and that the transmission rate should be slowed.
UDP Operation
The TCP/IP protocol stack contains many different protocols, and each protocol is 
designed to perform a speciﬁc task. IP provides Layer 3 connectionless transport 
through an internetwork. TCP enables connection-oriented, reliable transmission of 
packets at Layer 4 of the OSI model. UDP provides connectionless, non-guaranteed 
transmission of packets at Layer 4 of the OSI model.
Both TCP and UDP use IP as their underlying Layer 3 protocol. In addition, TCP and 
UDP are used by various application layer protocols. TCP provides services for appli-
cations such as FTP, HTTP, SMTP, and DNS. UDP is the transport layer protocol used 
by DNS, TFTP, SNMP, and DHCP. Figure 19-12 illustrates the relationship between 
TCP/IP application, transport, and network layer protocols.
Figure 19-12 TCP/IP Application, Transport, and Network Layer Protocols
TCP must be used when applications need to guarantee that a packet arrives intact, in 
sequence, and unduplicated. However, the overhead associated with ensuring delivery 
of the packet is sometimes a problem when using TCP. Not all applications need to 
guarantee delivery of the data packet, and therefore, some use the faster, connection-
less delivery mechanism offered by UDP. The UDP standard, described in RFC 768, is 
a simple protocol that exchanges segments without acknowledgments or guaranteed

delivery. As an example, TFTP can be used to transfer a conﬁguration ﬁle or a Cisco 
IOS Software image from a TFTP server to a router on an Ethernet network. TFTP 
uses the efﬁcient UDP transport protocol because the quality of physical connections is 
usually very good and the acknowledgement and retransmission capabilities of TCP 
are not necessary.
UDP does not use windowing or acknowledgments. Therefore, application layer pro-
tocols provide error detection. UDP is designed for applications that do not need to 
put sequences of segments together.
Figure 19-5 earlier in this chapter displayed the UDP segment format. The Source Port 
ﬁeld is an optional ﬁeld, used only if information needs to return to the sending host. 
The Destination Port ﬁeld speciﬁes the application to which UDP must pass the proto-
col. A DNS request from a host to a DNS server has a Destination Port ﬁeld of 53, 
th UDP port number for DNS. The Length ﬁeld identiﬁes the number of octets in the 
UDP segment. The UDP checksum is optional, but should be used to ensure that the 
data has not been damaged during transmission. For transport across the network, 
UDP is encapsulated within the IP packet.
After a UDP segment arrives at the destination IP address, a mechanism must exist that 
allows the receiving host to determine the destination application of the segment. Ports 
are used for this purpose. If a host is running both TFTP and DNS services, it must be 
able to determine what service the arriving UDP segments need. The Destination Port 
ﬁeld in the UDP header determines the application to which a UDP segment is delivered.
Overview of Transport Layer Ports
Transport layer ports are 16-bit numbers used to identify the connection end points on 
either side of the connecting devices. A particular network connection is then identiﬁed 
by a four-part (source address, source port, destination address, destination port) 
sequence. In principle, this scheme allows for unique UDP connections between any 
two hosts. UDP is still connectionless and unreliable. To support connection-oriented 
applications that require reliable, in-sequence data streams, TCP is used. Like UDP, 
TCP also uses ports to identify connection endpoints.
Multiple Conversations Between Hosts
At any given moment, thousands of packets providing hundreds of different services 
are traveling through a modern network. In many cases, servers provide several differ-
ent services simultaneously, which causes unique problems for the addressing of pack-
ets. For example, if a server is running both SMTP and World Wide Web services, a 
client cannot construct a packet destined for the IP address of the server just using TCP 
1102.book  Page 828  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Overview of Transport Layer Ports
829
because both SMTP and the World Wide Web services use TCP as their transport layer 
protocol. A port number must be associated with the conversation between hosts to 
ensure that the packet reaches the appropriate service on the server. Without a way to 
distinguish between different conversations, the client is unable to send an e-mail and 
browse a web page at the same time using one server. A method to separate transport 
layer conversations must be used.
Hosts running TCP/IP associate ports at the transport layer with certain applications. 
Port numbers are used to keep track of different conversations that cross the network 
at the same time. Port numbers are necessary when a host is communicating with a 
server running multiple services. Both TCP and UDP use port, or socket, numbers to 
pass information to the upper layers. Figure 19-13 shows an example of TCP and UDP 
port numbers.
Figure 19-13 TCP and UDP Port Numbers
Application software developers have agreed to use the well-known port numbers that 
are deﬁned in RFC 1700. For example, any conversation bound for the FTP applica-
tion uses the standard port number 21. Conversations that do not involve applications 
with well-known port numbers are assigned port numbers that have been randomly 
selected from within a speciﬁc range. These port numbers are used as source and desti-
nation addresses in the TCP segment. Table 19-1 lists the reserved TCP and UDP port 
numbers.

Overview of Transport Layer Ports
831
Port numbers have the following assigned ranges:
■Numbers below 255 are for public applications.
■Numbers from 255 to 1023 are assigned to companies for marketable applications.
■Numbers above 1023 are unregulated.
End systems use port numbers to select proper applications. As shown in Figure 19-14, 
the originating source port number (1028) is dynamically assigned by the source host. 
Usually, this port number is larger than 1023. The Internet Assigned Numbers Author-
ity (IANA) controls Port numbers in the range of zero to 1023.
Figure 19-14 Source and Destination Ports
Ports for Services
Services running on hosts must have a port number assigned to them for communica-
tion to occur. A remote host attempting to connect to a service expects that service to 
run on certain transport layer protocols at particular ports. Some ports, deﬁned in 
RFC 1700, are known as the well-known ports. These ports are reserved in both TCP 
and UDP.
These well-known ports can identify applications that run above the transport layer 
protocols. For example, a server running the FTP service forwards TCP connections 
using ports 20 and 21 from clients to its FTP application. This way, the server can

determine exactly what service a client is requesting. TCP and UDP use port numbers 
to determine the correct service to forward service requests to.
Ports for Clients
Whenever a client connects to a service on a server, a source and destination port must 
be speciﬁed. TCP and UDP segments contain ﬁelds for source and destination ports. 
Destination ports, or ports for services, are normally deﬁned using the well-known 
ports. Source ports, those set by the client, are determined dynamically.
In general, a client determines the source port by randomly assigning a number above 
1023. For instance, a client attempting to communicate with a web server uses TCP 
and assigns the destination port as 80 and the source port as 1045. When the packet 
arrives at the server, it passes up to the transport layer and eventually to the World 
Wide Web service, which operates at port 80. The World Wide Web server responds to 
the client’s request with a segment that uses port 80 as the source and port 1045 as the 
destination. In this way, clients and servers use ports to distinguish what process the 
segment is associated with. If a client has two browser sessions open to two different 
web servers, the destination port is 80 for both sessions. However, the source port is a 
different number for each session (for example, 1045 and 1048). This difference 
allows the client to keep track of the two different conversations.
Port Numbering and Well-Known Ports
Port numbers are represented by 2 bytes in the header of a TCP or UDP segment. This 
16-bit value can result in port numbers ranging from 0 to 65,535. These port numbers 
are divided into three different categories:
■Well-known ports
■Registered ports
■Dynamic or private ports
The ﬁrst 1023 ports are well-known ports. As previously discussed, these ports are 
used for well-known network services such as FTP, Telnet, DNS, or HTTP. Registered 
ports range from 1024 to 49151 and identify services such as Cisco-Net-Mgmt and 
Calendar Access Protocol. Finally, ports between 49152 and 65535 are deﬁned as 
dynamic or private ports.
Example of Multiple Sessions Between Hosts
Port numbers are used to track multiple sessions that can occur between hosts. A port 
number and a network address combine to form a socket. A pair of sockets, one on each 
1102.book  Page 832  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

TCP/IP and the Internet Layer
833
host, forms a unique connection. For example, a host can have a Telnet connection 
through port 23, while simultaneously surﬁng the net through port 80. The IP address 
and the MAC address are the same because the packets are coming from the same 
host. However, the port numbers are different because they are different protocols 
and, thus, different sockets.
Comparison of MAC Addresses, IP Addresses, and Port Numbers
MAC addresses, IP addresses, and port numbers are often confusing, but this confu-
sion can be avoided if the addresses are explained in reference to the OSI reference 
model. Port numbers are located at the transport layer and are serviced by the network 
layer. The network layer assigns the logical address, or IP. It is then serviced by the 
data link layer, which assigns the physical address, or MAC.
TCP/IP and the Internet Layer
Internet Protocol (IP) is the Layer 3 protocol responsible for the addressing scheme 
that allows packets to be properly routed over intranets and the Internet to their desti-
nations. Routers use the IP address information in an IP packet header to determine 
which interface the packet should be switched to in order to reach its destination. IP 
does not provide any services to ensure that the packet reaches its destination. IP is 
described as an unreliable, connectionless protocol. Packets might be dropped in route, 
arrive in the wrong order, or be transmitted faster than the receiver can accept them. IP 
has no means of overcoming these and other delivery issues.
The Internet layer of the TCP/IP stack corresponds to the network layer of the OSI 
model. The network layer is responsible for getting packets through a network using 
software addressing.

Chapter 19: Intermediate TCP
As shown in the Figure 19-15, several protocols operate at the TCP/IP Internet layer, 
corresponding to the OSI network layer:
■IP—Provides addressing and connectionless, best-effort delivery routing of data-
grams, is not concerned with the content of the datagrams, and looks for a way 
to move the datagrams to their destination
■ICMP—Provides control and messaging capabilities
■Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)—Determines the data link layer (MAC) 
addresses for known IP addresses
■Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP)—Determines network addresses 
when data link layer addresses are known
Figure 19-15 OSI Network Layer
How ARP Works
ARP is used to resolve or map a known IP address to a MAC sublayer address. This 
mapping allows for communication because the data link hardware will not accept a 
frame unless the MAC address in the frame matches the hardware MAC address (or it 
is a broadcast MAC address). To determine a destination MAC address for a datagram, 
a table called the ARP cache is checked. Every host on a TCP/IP network (routers, 
workstations, servers, and so on) maintains an ARP cache. If the address is not in the 
table, ARP sends a broadcast that is received by every station on the network, looking 
for the destination station. The term local ARP describes the search for an address 
when the requesting host and the destination host share the same medium or wire. As 
shown in Figure 19-16, before issuing the ARP, the subnet mask must be consulted. In 
this case, the mask determines that the nodes are on the same subnet.

Summary
835
Figure 19-16 OSI Network Layer
RARP is a TCP/IP protocol that permits a physical address, such as an Ethernet 
address, to be translated into an IP address. Consequently, this protocol is the opposite 
of ARP. Hosts such as diskless workstations often know only their hardware interface 
addresses, or MAC address, when booted, but not their IP addresses. They must dis-
cover their IP addresses from an external source. Usually, a RARP server using the 
RARP protocol can resolve this situation.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the following:
■TCP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides necessary 
quality of service processes to the unreliable IP protocol.

between hosts.
■Sliding windows allows for dynamic data ﬂow control.
■Sequence numbers ensure proper data reassembly by the receiving host.
■UDP is a connectionless transport layer protocol.
■UDP and TCP use ports to distinguish upper layer applications.

well-known ports
These ports are deﬁned in RFC 1700 and are reserved in both 
TCP and UDP. These well-known ports can identify applications that run above the 
transport layer protocols.
windowing

Access Control Lists
In this chapter, you learn about using standard and extended access control lists (ACLs) as 
a means to control network trafﬁc and how ACLs are used as part of a security solution.
In addition, this chapter includes tips, considerations, recommendations, and general 
guidelines on how to use ACLs, and includes the commands and conﬁgurations needed to 
create ACLs. Finally, this chapter provides examples of standard and extended ACLs and 
shows how to apply ACLs to router interfaces.

ACL Overview
Network administrators must be capable of denying unwanted access to the network 
while allowing appropriate access. Although security tools such as passwords, callback 
equipment, and physical security devices are helpful, they often lack the ﬂexibility of 
basic trafﬁc ﬁltering and the speciﬁc controls that most administrators prefer. For exam-
ple, a network administrator might want to allow users access to the Internet but might 
not want external users Telnetting into the LAN.
Routers provide basic trafﬁc-ﬁltering capabilities, such as blocking Internet trafﬁc, with 
access control lists (ACLs). An ACL is a sequential collection of permit or deny state-
ments that apply to addresses or upper-layer protocols. 
1102.book  Page 841  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

842
Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
It is important to conﬁgure ACLs correctly and to know where to place ACLs on the 
network. ACLs serve multiple purposes in a network. Common ACL functions include 
the following: 
■Filtering packets internally
■Protecting the internal network from illegal Internet access 
■Restricting access to virtual terminal ports
ACLs are lists of instructions that you apply to a router’s interface. These lists tell the 
router what kinds of packets to accept and what kinds of packets to deny. Acceptance 
and denial can be based on certain speciﬁcations, such as source address, destination 
address, and TCP/UDP port number.
ACLs enable you to manage trafﬁc and scan speciﬁc packets by applying the ACL to a 
router interface. Any trafﬁc going through the interface is tested against certain condi-
tions that are part of the ACL.
ACLs can be created for all routed network protocols, such as Internet Protocol (IP) 
and Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), to ﬁlter packets as the packets pass through 
a router. ACLs can be conﬁgured at the router to control access to a network or subnet. 
ACLs ﬁlter network trafﬁc by controlling whether routed packets are forwarded or 
blocked at the router’s interfaces. The router examines each packet to determine 
whether to forward or drop it, based on the conditions speciﬁed in the ACL. ACL 
conditions could be the source address of the trafﬁc, the destination address of the 
trafﬁc, the upper-layer protocol, the port, or applications.
ACLs must be deﬁned on a per-protocol basis. In other words, you must deﬁne an 
ACL for every protocol enabled on an interface if you want to control trafﬁc ﬂow for 
that protocol on that interface. (Note that some protocols refer to ACLs as ﬁlters.)
For example, if your router interface were conﬁgured for IP, AppleTalk, and IPX, you 
would need to deﬁne at least three ACLs. As shown in Figure 20-1, ACLs can be used 
as a tool for network control by adding the ﬂexibility to ﬁlter the packets that ﬂow in 
or out of router interfaces. This is accomplished by establishing a numbering range or 
scheme for each protocol’s ACL. You learn more about the ACL numbers later in this 
chapter.
NOTE
ACLs consume CPU 
resources in the router 
because every packet 
has to be punted to 
the CPU.

Why Create ACLs?
843
Figure 20-1 ACL Example
Why Create ACLs?
Many reasons exist for creating ACLs. ACLs can be used to do the following:
 
■Limit network trafﬁc and increase network performance. For example, ACLs can 
designate certain packets to be processed by a router before other trafﬁc, on the 
basis of a protocol. This is referred to as queuing. Queuing ensures that routers 
will not process packets that are not needed. As a result, queuing limits network 
trafﬁc and reduces network congestion.
 
■Provide trafﬁc ﬂow control. For example, ACLs can restrict or reduce the con-
tents of routing updates. These restrictions are used to limit information about 
speciﬁc networks from propagating through the network. 
 
■Provide a basic level of security for network access. ACLs can allow one host to 
access a part of your network and prevent another host from accessing the same 
area. In Figure 20-2, Host A is allowed to access the Human Resources network, 
and Host B is prevented from accessing the Human Resources network. If you do 
not conﬁgure ACLs on your router, all packets passing through the router could 
be allowed onto all parts of the network.
 
■Decide which type of trafﬁc is forwarded or blocked at the router interface. For 
example, you can permit e-mail trafﬁc to be routed, but at the same time block 
all Telnet trafﬁc.

Figure 20-2 Limiting Network Trafﬁc
Creating an ACL: Why Order Matters
Order matters when creating an ACL. As trafﬁc enters or exits a router’s interface, 
where an ACL is applied, Cisco IOS Software compares the packet against the rules 
deﬁned in the ACL. Statements are evaluated in the order they were entered into the 
ACL by the network administrator. The packet is compared, one at a time in sequence, 
until a match is found. After a match is found, the action speciﬁed in the line matching 
the trafﬁc in question is taken. No more conditions are checked. 
For example, if a condition statement permitting all trafﬁc is created, statements added 
later will never be checked. If additional statements are required or if statements must 
be changed, you must delete the ACL and re-create it with the new statements. It is a 
good idea to use a PC text editor to create and modify ACLs and then send them to the 
router via Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) or HyperTerminal text ﬁle transfer. 
Using ACLs
You can create an ACL for each protocol that you want to ﬁlter for each router inter-
face. For some protocols, you create one ACL to ﬁlter inbound trafﬁc and one ACL to 
ﬁlter outbound trafﬁc.
After an ACL statement checks a packet for a match, the packet can be denied or per-
mitted to use an interface in the access group. Cisco IOS Software ACLs check the 
packet and upper-layer headers, as shown in Figure 20-3.

How ACLs Work
845
Figure 20-3 Checking the Packet and Upper-Layer Headers
How ACLs Work
An ACL is a group of statements that deﬁne how packets do the following:
■Enter inbound router interfaces 
■Relay through the router
■Exit outbound router interfaces
As shown in Figure 20-4, the beginning of the communication process is the same, 
whether ACLs are used or not. As a packet enters an interface, the router checks to 
see whether the packet is routable or bridgeable. Now the router checks whether the 
inbound interface has an ACL. If one exists, the packet is tested against the conditions 
in the list. If the packet is allowed, it then is checked against routing table entries to 
determine the destination interface. ACLs ﬁlter not packets that originate in the router 
itself, but packets from other sources.
Next, the router checks whether the destination interface has an ACL. If it does not, 
the packet can be sent to the destination interface directly; for example, if it will use 
E0, which has no ACLs, the packet uses E0 directly.
ACL statements operate in a sequential, logical order. If a condition match is true, the 
packet is permitted or denied and the rest of the ACL statements are not checked. If all 
the ACL statements are unmatched, an implicit deny any statement is imposed. Even 
though you will not see the deny any as the last line of an ACL, it is there by default. In 
Figure 20-5, if by matching the ﬁrst test a packet is denied access to the destination, it 
is discarded and dropped into the bit bucket. It is not exposed to any ACL tests that 
follow. If the packet does not match the conditions of the ﬁrst test, it drops to the next 
statement in the ACL.

Assigning a Unique Number to Each ACL
847
ACLs enable you to control what clients can access on your network. Conditions in an 
ACL ﬁle can do the following:
■Screen out certain hosts to either allow or deny access to part of your network
■Grant or deny users permission to access only certain types of applications, such 
as FTP or HTTP
ACL Conﬁguration Tasks
In practice, ACL commands can be lengthy character strings. Key tasks covered in this 
section for creating ACLs include the following:
■You create ACLs by using global conﬁguration mode.
■Specifying an ACL number from 1 to 99 deﬁnes a standard ACL for IP and 
instructs the router to accept standard ACL statements. 
■Specifying an ACL number from 100 to 199 deﬁnes an extended ACL for IP and 
instructs the router to accept extended ACL statements.
■You must carefully select and logically order the ACL. Permitted IP protocols 
must be speciﬁed; all other protocols should be denied unless required.
■You need to select which protocols to check; any other protocols are not 
checked. Later in the procedure, you can specify an optional destination port for 
more precision.
■You apply an ACL to an interface. 
Although each protocol has its own set of speciﬁc tasks and rules that are required to 
provide trafﬁc ﬁltering, in general most protocols require two basic steps: 
Step 1
Create an ACL deﬁnition. 
Step 2
Apply the ACL to an interface.
ACLs are assigned to one or more interfaces and can ﬁlter inbound trafﬁc or outbound 
trafﬁc, depending on the conﬁguration and how they are applied. Outbound ACLs 
generally are more efﬁcient than inbound and, therefore, are preferred. A router with 
an inbound ACL must check every packet to see whether it matches the ACL condition 
before switching the packet to an outbound interface.
Assigning a Unique Number to Each ACL
When conﬁguring ACLs on a router, you must identify each ACL uniquely by assign-
ing a number to the protocol’s ACL. When you use a number to identify an ACL, the 
1102.book  Page 847  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
number must be within the speciﬁc range of numbers that is valid for the protocol. 
Example 20-1 deﬁnes ACLs 1 and 2 and applies the ACLs to interface Ethernet 0:
Table 20-1 lists valid protocol ACL numbers.
Using Wildcard Mask Bits
A wildcard mask is a 32-bit quantity that is divided into four octets, with each octet 
containing 8 bits. A wildcard mask bit of 0 means “check the corresponding bit 
value,” and a wildcard mask bit of 1 means “do not check (ignore) that corresponding 
bit value” (see Figure 20-6).
Example 20-1 Assigning ACLs to an Interface

access-list 1 deny 7.9.0.0 0.0.255.255

Using Wildcard Mask Bits
849
Figure 20-6 Wildcard Mask Bit Matching
A wildcard mask is paired with an IP address, similar to how a subnet mask is paired 
with an IP address. Wildcard mask bits use the numbers 1 and 0 to identify how to 
treat the corresponding IP address bits.
ACLs use wildcard masking to identify a single address or multiple addresses for per-
mit or deny tests. The term wildcard masking is a nickname for the ACL mask bit–
matching process and comes from of an analogy of a wildcard that matches any other 
card in a poker game.
Although both are 32-bit quantities, wildcard masks and IP subnet masks operate dif-
ferently. Recall that the 0s and 1s in a subnet mask determine the network, subnet, and 
host portions of the corresponding IP address. The 0s and 1s in a wildcard, as just 
noted, determine whether the corresponding bits in the IP address should be checked 
or ignored for ACL purposes.
As you have learned, the 0 and 1 bits in an ACL wildcard mask cause the ACL to 
either check or ignore the corresponding bits in the IP address. Figure 20-7 demon-
strates how this wildcard masking process is applied. 
Suppose that you want to test an IP address for subnets that will be permitted or 
denied. Assume that the IP address is a Class B address (that is, the ﬁrst two octets 
are the network number) with 8 bits of subnetting (the third octet is for subnets).
You want to use IP wildcard mask bits to permit all packets from any host in the 
172.30.16.0 to 172.30.31.0 subnets. Figure 20-7 shows an example of how to use 
the wildcard mask to do this.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
Figure 20-7 Wildcard Mask Example
To begin, the wildcard mask checks the ﬁrst two octets (172.30), using corresponding 
0 bits in the wildcard mask.
Because there is no interest in individual host addresses (a valid host ID does not have 
.0 at the end of the address), the wildcard mask ignores the ﬁnal octet, using corre-
sponding 1 bits in the wildcard mask.
In the third octet, the wildcard mask is 15 (00001111), and the IP address is 16 
(00010000). The ﬁrst four 0s in the wildcard mask tell the router to match the ﬁrst 
4 bits of the IP address (0001). Because the last 4 bits are ignored, all numbers in the 
range of 16 (00010000) to 31 (00011111) will match because they begin in the pattern 
0001.
For the ﬁnal (least-signiﬁcant) 4 bits in this octet, the wildcard mask ignores the value 
because in these positions, the address value can be binary 0 or binary 1, and the corre-
sponding wildcard bits are 1s. In this example, the wildcard mask tells the router to 
match the ﬁrst 4 bits of the IP address. The remaining 4 bits are ignored altogether. 
Therefore, the address 172.30.16.0 with the wildcard mask 0.0.15.255 matches subnets 
172.30.16.0 to 172.30.31.0. The wildcard mask does not match any other subnets.
Using the Wildcard any
Working with decimal representations of binary wildcard mask bits can be tedious. 
For the most common uses of wildcard masking, you can use abbreviations. These 
abbreviations reduce the amount of typing you need to do when conﬁguring address 
test conditions. One such example is the wildcard any. For example, assume that you

want to specify that any destination address will be permitted in an ACL test. To 
indicate any IP address, you would enter 0.0.0.0, as shown in Figure 20-8; then, to 
indicate that the ACL should ignore (that is, allow without checking) any value, the 
corresponding wildcard mask bits for this address would be all 1s (that is, 
255.255.255.255).
Figure 20-8 Wildcard any
You can use the abbreviation of any to communicate this same test condition on Cisco 
IOS Software. Instead of typing 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255, you can use the word any 
by itself as the keyword.
For example, instead of using this:
Router(config)#access-list 1 permit 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255
You can use this:
Router(config)#access-list 1 permit any
Using the Wildcard host
A second common condition in which Cisco IOS Software permits an abbreviation in 
the ACL wildcard mask arises when you want to match all the bits of an entire IP host 
address. For example, suppose that you want to specify that a unique host IP address 
will be permitted in an ACL test. To indicate a host IP address, you would enter the 
full address (for example, 172.30.16.29, as shown in Figure 20-9). Then, to indicate 
that the ACL should check all the bits in the address, the corresponding wildcard mask 
bits for this address would be all 0s (that is, 0.0.0.0).

For example, instead of using this:
Router(config)#access-list 1 permit 172.30.16.29 0.0.0.0
You can use this:
Router(config)#access-list 1 permit host 172.30.16.29
Standard ACLs
Standard ACLs check the source address of routed IP packets and compare it against 
the statements deﬁning the ACL, as demonstrated in Figure 20-10. 
Figure 20-10 Standard ACL Operations
Standard ACLs either permit or deny access for an entire protocol suite (such as IP), 
based on the network, subnet, and host addresses. For example, packets coming in 
interface E0 or Fa0/0 are checked for their source addresses and protocols and then are 
compared against the ACL. When a match is found, that action (permit or deny) is 
performed. Packets matching permit statements in the ACL then are routed through 
the router to an output interface. Packets matching deny statements in the ACL are 
discarded (dropped) at the incoming interface.

Standard ACLs
853
The following is the full syntax of the standard ACL command: 
Router(config)# access-list access-list-number {deny | permit} source
  [source-wildcard] [log] 
The no form of this command is used to remove a standard ACL. This following is the 
syntax for the no form of this command:
Router(config)# no access-list access-list-number
Table 20-2 shows descriptions of the parameters used in this syntax. 
Table 20-2 Standard ACL Parameters 
Parameter
Description
access-list-number
Number of an access list. This is a decimal number from 1 to 
99 or from 1300 to 1999.
deny
Denies access if the conditions are matched.
permit
Permits access if the conditions are matched.
source
Number of the network or host from which the packet is being 
sent. There are two alternative ways to specify the source:
■Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal format.
■Use the any keyword as an abbreviation for a source and 
source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.
source-wildcard
(Optional) Wildcard bits to be applied to the source. There are 
two alternative ways to specify the source wildcard:
Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal format. Place 
1s in the bit positions you want to ignore.
Use the any keyword as an abbreviation for a source and 
source-wildcard value of 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.
log
(Optional) Causes an informational logging message about the 
packet that matches the entry to be sent to the console. (The 
level of messages logged to the console is controlled by the 
logging console command.)
The message includes the access list number, whether the 
packet was permitted or denied, the source address, and the 
number of packets. The message is generated for the ﬁrst 
packet that matches and then at ﬁve-minute intervals, includ-
ing the number of packets permitted or denied in the previous 
ﬁve-minute interval.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
The standard version of the access-list global conﬁguration command deﬁnes a standard 
ACL with a number ranging from 1 to 99. Example 20-2 shows four ACL statements, 
all of which belong to access list 2, although this combination is not likely it illustrates 
how several different statement can work. Also remember that if a packet does not 
match any of these tests, there is an implicit (unseen) deny any at end of the ACL. 
In the ﬁrst ACL statement, notice that there is no wildcard mask. In situations like this, 
when no wildcard mask is shown, the default mask is used, which is 0.0.0.0. This 
statement denies the IP address 172.16.1.1. 
The second statement permits the speciﬁc host 172.16.1.0 or any host from the 
172.16.1.0 subnet. 
The third statement denies any host from the 172.16.0.0 network, and the fourth 
statement permits any host from any network starting with 172.
log
Use the ip access-list log-update command to generate the log-
ging messages to appear when the number of matches reaches 
a conﬁgurable threshold (instead of waiting for a ﬁve-minute 
interval). To learn more about the ip access-list log-update
command, you can check the following resource at Cisco for 
more information: www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/
software/ios120/12cgcr/cbkixol.htm.
The logging facility might drop some logging message packets 
if there are too many to be handled or if there is more than one 
logging message to be handled in one second. This behavior 
prevents the router from crashing because of too many logging 
packets. Therefore, the logging facility should not be used as a 
billing tool or an accurate source of the number of matches to 
an access list.
Example 20-2 Standard ACL Statements
access-list 2 deny 172.16.1.1
access-list 2 permit 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 2 deny 172.16.1.1 0.0.255.255
access-list 2 permit 172.16.1.1 0.255.255.255

Extended ACLs
855
The ip access-group command links an existing ACL to an interface. It is necessary to 
enter interface conﬁguration mode ﬁrst to access the desired interface (for example, 
s0/0). The format of the command is as follows: 
Router(config-if)# ip access-group access-list number {in | out} 
Extended ACLs
Extended ACLs are used more often than standard ACLs because they provide a 
greater range of ﬂexibility and control. Extended ACLs check the source and destina-
tion IP addresses and also can check for protocols and TCP or UDP port numbers. 
Figure 20-11 illustrates the decision process that a router uses to evaluate packets 
against extended ACLs. 
Figure 20-11 Extended ACL Operations
Access can be permitted or denied based on where a packet originated, its destination, 
the protocol type, the port addresses, and application. An extended ACL can allow 
e-mail trafﬁc from Fa0/0 to speciﬁc S0/0 destinations while denying ﬁle transfers and 
web browsing. When packets are discarded, some protocols send an echo packet to the 
sender, which states that the destination was unreachable.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
Extended ACLs have more granularity in terms of control and packet manipulation 
than standard ACLs. Whereas standard ACLs can prevent or deny only an entire pro-
tocol suite, extended ACL gives you the capability to “nitpick” which protocol in the 
suite you want to deny or allow. For example, allow HTTP but not FTP.
The following is the full syntax of the extended ACL command: 
Router(config)# access-list access-list-number [dynamic dynamic-name [timeout 
  minutes]] {deny | permit} protocol source source-wildcard destination destination-
  wildcard [precedence precedence] [tos tos] [log | log-input] [time-range time-
  range-name] [fragments]
The no form of this command is used to remove a standard ACL. The following is the 
syntax for the no form of this command:
Router(config)# no access-list access-list-number
The syntax for extended ACL statements can get very long and often wraps in the ter-
minal window. Many additional options are available in extended ACLs as docu-
mented in Table 20-3.
Table 20-3 Extended ACL Parameters 
Parameter
Description
access-list-number
Number of an access list. This is a decimal number 
from 100 to 199 or from 2000 to 2699.
dynamic dynamic-name
(Optional) Identiﬁes this ACL as a dynamic ACL. 
Refer to lock-and-key access documented in the 
“Conﬁguring Lock-and-Key Security (Dynamic 
Access Lists)” chapter in the Cisco IOS Security 
Conﬁguration Guide.
timeout minutes
(Optional) Speciﬁes the absolute length of time, in 
minutes, that a temporary access list entry can 
remain in a dynamic access list. The default is an inﬁ-
nite length of time and allows an entry to remain 
permanently. Refer to lock-and-key access docu-
mented in the “Conﬁguring Lock-and-Key Security 
(Dynamic Access Lists)” chapter in the Cisco IOS 
Security Conﬁguration Guide.
deny
Denies access if the conditions are matched.
permit
Permits access if the conditions are matched.

857
protocol
Name or number of an Internet protocol. It can be 
one of the keywords eigrp, gre, icmp, igmp, igrp, ip,
ipinip, nos, ospf, pim, tcp, or udp, or an integer in 
the range from 0 to 255 representing an Internet pro-
tocol number. To match any Internet protocol 
(including ICMP, TCP, and UDP), use the ip key-
word. Some protocols allow further qualiﬁers.
source
Number of the network or host from which the 
packet is being sent. There are three alternative ways 
to specify the source:
Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal 
format.
Use the any keyword as an abbreviation for a source
and source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.
Use host source as an abbreviation for a source and 
source-wildcard of source 0.0.0.0.
source-wildcard
Wildcard bits to be applied to the source. Each wild-
card bit 0 indicates the corresponding bit position in 
the source. Each wildcard bit set to 1 indicates that 
both a 0 bit and a 1 bit in the corresponding position 
of the IP address of the packet will be considered a 
match to this access list entry. 
There are three alternative ways to specify the source 
wildcard:
Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal 
format. Place 1s in the bit positions that you want to 
ignore.
Use the any keyword as an abbreviation for a source
and source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255.
Use host source as an abbreviation for a source and 
source-wildcard of source 0.0.0.0.
Wildcard bits set to 1 need not be contiguous in the 
source wildcard. For example, a source wildcard of 
0.255.0.64 would be valid.

destination
Number of the network or host to which the packet 
is being sent. There are three alternative ways to 
specify the destination:
Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal 
format.
Use the any keyword as an abbreviation for the 
destination and destination-wildcard of 0.0.0.0 
255.255.255.255.
Use host destination as an abbreviation for a destina-
tion and destination-wildcard of destination 0.0.0.0.

are three alternative ways to specify the destination 
wildcard:
Use a 32-bit quantity in four-part dotted-decimal 
format. Place 1s in the bit positions that you want to 
ignore.

nation and destination-wildcard of 0.0.0.0 
255.255.255.255.
Use host destination as an abbreviation for a destina-
tion and destination-wildcard of destination 0.0.0.0.
precedence precedence
(Optional) Packets can be ﬁltered by precedence 
level, as speciﬁed by a number from 0 to 7. This is 
used by the quality of service (QoS) mechanism.
tos tos
(Optional) Packets can be ﬁltered by type of service 
level, as speciﬁed by a number from 0 to 15. This is 
used by the QoS mechanism.
log
(Optional) Causes an informational logging message 
about the packet that matches the entry to be sent to 
the console. (The level of messages logged to the con-
sole is controlled by the logging console command.)

log
The message includes the access list number, whether 
the packet was permitted or denied; the protocol, 
whether it was TCP, UDP, ICMP, or a number; and, 
if appropriate, the source and destination addresses 
and source and destination port numbers. By default, 
the message is generated for the ﬁrst packet that 
matches and then at ﬁve-minute intervals, including 
the number of packets permitted or denied in the 
previous ﬁve-minute interval.
Use the ip access-list log-update command to gener-
ate logging messages when the number of matches 
reaches a conﬁgurable threshold (instead of waiting 
for a 5-minute interval). See the ip access-list log-
update command for more information.
The logging facility might drop some logging mes-
sage packets if there are too many to be handled or if 
there is more than one logging message to be han-
dled in one second. This behavior prevents the router 
from crashing because of too many logging packets. 
Therefore, the logging facility should not be used as 
a billing tool or an accurate source of the number of 
matches to an access list.
log-input
(Optional) Includes the input interface and source 
MAC address or VC in the logging output.
time-range time-range-name
(Optional) Name of the time range that applies to 
this statement. The name of the time range and its 
restrictions are speciﬁed by the time-range command.
icmp-type
(Optional) ICMP packets can be ﬁltered by ICMP 
message type. The type is a number from 0 to 255.
icmp-code
(Optional) ICMP packets that are ﬁltered by ICMP 
message type also can be ﬁltered by the ICMP mes-
sage code. The code is a number from 0 to 255.
icmp-message
(Optional) ICMP packets can be ﬁltered by an ICMP 
message type name or ICMP message type and code 
name.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
For a single ACL, multiple statements can be conﬁgured. Each of these statements 
should contain the same access-list-number to relate the statements to the same ACL, 
as in Example 20-2. There can be as many condition statements as necessary. These 
condition statements are limited only by the available router memory. The more state-
ments there are, the more difﬁcult it will be to comprehend and manage the ACL. The 
igmp-type
(Optional) IGMP packets can be ﬁltered by IGMP 
message type or message name. A message type is a 
number from 0 to 15.
operator
(Optional) Compares source or destination ports. 
Possible operands include lt (less than), gt (greater 
than), eq (equal), neq (not equal), and range (inclu-
sive range). 
If the operator is positioned after the source and
source-wildcard, it must match the source port.
If the operator is positioned after the destination and
destination-wildcard, it must match the destination 
port.
The range operator requires two port numbers. All 
other operators require one port number.
port
(Optional) Indicates the decimal number or name of 
a TCP or UDP port. A port number is a number 
from 0 to 65,535. TCP port names can be used only 
when ﬁltering TCP. UDP port names can be used 
only when ﬁltering UDP.
TCP port names can be used only when ﬁltering 
TCP. UDP port names can be used only when ﬁlter-
ing UDP.
established
(Optional) For the TCP protocol only: Indicates an 
established connection. A match occurs if the TCP 
datagram has the ACK, FIN, PSH, RST, SYN, or 
URG control bits set. The nonmatching case is that 
of the initial TCP datagram to form a connection.
fragments
(Optional) This ACL entry applies to noninitial frag-
ments of packets; the fragment is either permitted or 
denied accordingly.

Extended ACLs
861
three statements in Example 20-3 combine to permit telnet, ftp, and ftp-data from any 
host on the 172.16.6.0 subnetwork to any other network.
Extended ACLs are very versatile and, as such, provide different options and argu-
ments based on the protocol used. Therefore, syntax will differ based on which of 
these protocols are in use. These protocols are listed here:
■Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
■Internet Group Message Protocol (IGMP)
■Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
■User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
The sections that follow describe the syntax variation of extended ACLs based on the 
protocol used.
Conﬁguring Extended ACLs for ICMP
ACLs for ICMP use the following syntax:
access-list access-list-number [dynamic dynamic-name [timeout minutes]] {deny | 
  permit} icmp source source-wildcard destination destination-wildcard [icmp-type 
  [icmp-code] | icmp-message] [precedence precedence] [tos tos] [log | log-input] 
  [time-range time-range-name] [fragments]
Conﬁguring Extended ACLs for IGMP
ACLs for IGMP use the following syntax:
access-list access-list-number [dynamic dynamic-name [timeout minutes]] {deny | 
  permit} igmp source source-wildcard destination destination-wildcard [igmp-type] 
  [precedence precedence] [tos tos] [log | log-input] [time-range time-range-name] 
  [fragments]
Conﬁguring Extended ACLs for TCP
ACLs for TCP use the following syntax:
access-list access-list-number [dynamic dynamic-name [timeout minutes]] {deny | 
  permit} tcp source source-wildcard [operator [port]] destination destination-
  wildcard [operator [port]] [established] [precedence precedence] [tos tos] [log | 
  log-input] [time-range time-range-name] [fragments]
Example 20-3 Extended ACL Statements
access-list 114 permit tcp 172.16.6.0 0.0.0.255 any eq telnet
access-list 114 permit tcp 172.16.6.0 0.0.0.255 any eq ftp
access-list 114 permit tcp 172.16.6.0 0.0.0.255 any eq ftp-data

  [time-range time-range-name] [fragments]
Extended ACL Defaults
An extended ACL defaults to a list that denies everything. An extended ACL is termi-
nated by an implicit deny statement.
At the end of the extended ACL statement, additional precision is gained from a ﬁeld that 
speciﬁes the optional TCP or UDP port number. Figure 20-12 illustrates this concept.

Named ACLs
863
The ip access-group command links an existing extended ACL to an interface. Only one 
ACL per interface, per direction, per protocol is allowed, as emphasized in Figure 20-13. 
The format of the command is as follows:
Router(config-if)# ip access-group access-list number {in | out} 
Figure 20-13 ACL Rules
Named ACLs
IP named ACLs were introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 11.2, which allowed 
standard and extended ACLs to be given names instead of numbers. The advantages 
that a named access list provides are as follows:
■Intuitively identiﬁes an ACL using an alpha or alphanumeric name 
■Eliminates the limit of 99 simple and 100 extended ACLs 
■Enables administrators to modiﬁes ACLs without having to delete and then 
reconﬁgure them

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
A named ACL is created with the ip access-list command. The named ACL syntax is as 
follows:
ip access-list {extended | standard} name
This places the user in ACL conﬁguration mode. In this mode, you can specify one or 
more conditions for permitting or denying access to a packet. The available options 
are as follows:
Router(config-ext-nacl)#permit | deny protocol source source-wildcard [operator 
  [port]] destination destination-wildcard [operator [port]] [established] 
  [precedence precedence] [tos tos] [log] [time-range time-range-name]
The permit or deny operand tells the router what action to take when a packet has met 
the other criteria speciﬁed in the ACL—that is, whether to forward or drop the packet. 
Example 20-4 demonstrates applying a named ACL.
In Example 20-4, the access list is given the name server-access. This access list then is 
applied to interface Fast Ethernet 0/0. This access list enables users to access the mail 
and DNS server only; all other requests are denied.
A named ACL allows for the deletion of statements, but statements can be inserted 
only at the end of a list, as demonstrated in Example 20-5.
Example 20-4 Named ACL Statements
! Named ACL created:
Rt(config)# ip access-list extended server-access
Rt(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp any host 131.108.101.99 eq smtp
Rt(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp any host 131.108.101.99 eq domain
Rt(config-ext-nacl)# deny ip any any log
Rt(config-ext-nacl)# ^Z
! Named ACL Applied:
Rt(config)# interface fastethernet0/0
Rt(config-if)# ip access-group server-access out
Rt(config-if)# ^Z
Example 20-5 Named ACL Statements 
router# configure terminal
  Enter configuration commands, one per line. 
  router(config)# ip access-list extended test
  router(config-ext-nacl)# permit ip host 2.2.2.2 host 3.3.3.3
  router(config-ext-nacl)# permit tcp host 1.1.1.1 host 5.5.5.5 eq www
1102.book  Page 864  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  2:53 PM

Named ACLs
865
Consider the following before implementing named ACLs:
■Named ACLs are not compatible with Cisco IOS Software releases prior to 
Release 11.2. 
■The same name cannot be used for multiple ACLs. For example, it is not permis-
sible to specify both a standard and an extended ACL named George. 
The series of commands shown in Example 20-6 ﬁrst create a standard ACL named 
Internetﬁlter and an extended ACL named marketing_group. The commands then 
  router(config-ext-nacl)# permit icmp any any
  router(config-ext-nacl)# permit udp host 6.6.6.6 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq domain

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
access interface e0/5, assign an IP address, and then apply both ACLs to an interface 
(Ethernet 0/5).
Placing ACLs
ACLs control trafﬁc by ﬁltering packets and eliminating unwanted trafﬁc on a net-
work. An important consideration when implementing ACLs is where the access list is 
placed. When placed in the proper location, ACLs not only ﬁlter trafﬁc, but they also 
can make the entire network operate more efﬁciently. For ﬁltering trafﬁc, the ACL 
should be placed where it has the greatest impact on increasing network efﬁciency.
Refer to Figure 20-14. Suppose that the enterprise policy wants to deny Telnet or FTP 
trafﬁc on Router A access to the switched Ethernet LAN on the Fa0/0 port of Router 
D. At the same time, other trafﬁc must be permitted. This policy can be implemented 
several ways. The recommended approach uses an extended ACL, specifying both 
source and destination addresses. If this extended ACL is placed in Router A, packets 
will not cross the Ethernet of Router A or the serial interfaces of Routers B and C, and 
will not enter Router D. This will reduce trafﬁc on the network links between Routers 
A and D. Trafﬁc with different source and destination addresses still will be permitted.

Lab Activity
Named ACLs
In this lab, you create a Named ACL to permit or deny speciﬁc trafﬁc and test 
the ACL to determine if the desired results were achieved.

Firewalls
867
Figure 20-14 Placing ACLs
The general rule is to put the extended ACLs as close to the source of the denied trafﬁc 
as possible. Standard ACLs do not specify destination addresses, so they should be 
placed as close to the destination as possible. For example, a standard ACL would 
be placed on Fa0/0 of Router D to prevent trafﬁc from Router A.
In the advanced conﬁguration, a feature called Turbo ACL compiles the ACL, making 
the process a lot faster. The Turbo ACL feature allows for a more efﬁcient searching 
algorithm and also allows the list to be parsed in a more efﬁcient manner.
Firewalls
A ﬁrewall is a computer or networking device that exists between the user and the out-
side world to protect the internal network from intruders. In most circumstances, 
intruders come from the global Internet and the thousands of remote networks that it 
interconnects. Typically, a network ﬁrewall consists of several different machines that 
work together to prevent unwanted and illegal access. Figure 20-15 shows a simple 
ﬁrewall architecture.
Lab Activity
Extended ACLs
In this lab, you plan, conﬁgure, and apply an Extended ACL to permit or deny 
speciﬁc trafﬁc and test the ACL to determine whether the desired results were 
achieved.

CAUTION
ACL operation can 
slow the router in per-
forming its routing 
tasks. The router has 
to read more of the 
packet and compare 
more parameters 
before it even gets to 
the routing operations.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
Figure 20-15 Firewall Architecture
In ﬁrewall architecture, the router that is connected to the Internet is referred to as the 
exterior router. It forces all incoming trafﬁc to pass through the application gateway. 
The router that is connected to the internal network is the interior router. The interior 
router accepts packets only from the application gateway. The gateway controls the 
delivery of network-based services both to and from the internal network. For exam-
ple, the ﬁrewall might allow only certain users to communicate with the Internet, or 
permit only certain applications to establish connections between an interior and exte-
rior host. If the only application that is permitted is mail, then only mail packets will 
be allowed through the router. This protects the application gateway and avoids over-
whelming it with unauthorized packets.
Using ACLs with Firewalls
ACLs should be used in ﬁrewall routers, which often are positioned between the inter-
nal network and an external network, such as the Internet. The ﬁrewall router provides 
a point of isolation so that the rest of the internal network structure is not affected. 
You also can use ACLs on a router positioned between two parts of the network, to 
control trafﬁc entering or exiting a speciﬁc part of the internal network. 
To provide the security beneﬁts of ACLs, you should, at a minimum, conﬁgure ACLs 
on border routers, which are routers situated on the boundaries of the network, and 
are also known as ﬁrewall routers. This provides basic security from the outside net-
work, or from a less controlled area of the network, into a more private area of the 
network.
On these border routers, ACLs can be created for each network protocol conﬁgured 
on the router interfaces. You can conﬁgure ACLs so that inbound trafﬁc, outbound 
trafﬁc, or both are filtered on an interface.

Restricting Virtual Terminal Access
869
Restricting Virtual Terminal Access
Standard and extended ACLs apply to packets traveling through a router. They are not 
designed to block packets that originate within the router. By default, an outbound 
Telnet-extended ACL does not prevent router-initiated Telnet sessions. 
In addition to physical ports or interfaces on the router, such as Fa0/0 and S0/0, there 
are virtual ports. These virtual ports are called vty lines. There are ﬁve vty lines, which 
are numbered zero through four, as shown in Figure 20-16. For security purposes, 
users can be denied or permitted virtual terminal access to the router, but denied access 
to destinations from that router. For example, an administrator can conﬁgure the ACL 
to allow terminal access to the router for management or troubleshooting purposes, 
while at the same time restricting access beyond this router.
Figure 20-16 Restricting vty Access with ACLs
Restricting vty access is not commonly used as a trafﬁc control mechanism; instead, it 
is for increasing network security. vty access is accomplished using the Telnet protocol 
to make a nonphysical connection to the router. As a result, there is only one type of 
vty ACL. Identical restrictions should be placed on all vty lines because it is impossible 
to control which line a user will connect on.
Whereas a vty ACL is created the same way as on an interface, applying the vty ACL 
to a terminal line requires using the access-class command instead of the access-group
command. Example 20-7 demonstrates creating and applying a virtual terminal access 
list.
Example 20-7 Restricting vty Access with ACLs 
! Creating the standard list:
Rt1(config)# access-list 2 permit 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255
Rt1(config)# access-list 2 permit 172.16.2.0 0.0.0.255

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
Keep the following considerations in mind when conﬁguring access lists on vty lines:
■A name or number can be used when controlling access to an interface. 
■Only numbered access lists can be applied to virtual lines.
■Identical restrictions should be set on all the virtual terminal lines because a user 
can attempt to connect to any of them.
Verifying ACLs
The show ip interface command displays IP interface information and indicates 
whether any ACLs are set. Example 20-8 shows the output of the show ip interface
command. As you can see in rows 9 and 10 in Example 20-8, ACL 10 is set to the out-
going trafﬁc on interface Ethernet 0. There is no ACL set to inbound trafﬁc.
! Applying the access list:
Rt1(config)# line vty 0 4
Rt1(config)# login
Rt1(config)# password secret
Rt1(config)# access-class 2 in

Summary
871
The show access-lists command displays the contents of all ACLs. By entering the ACL 
name or number as an option for this command, you can see a speciﬁc list.
Summary
This chapter presented an overview of the following key points:
■The two main types of ACLs are standard and extended.
■Named ACLs allow access lists to be identiﬁed by name instead of number.
■ACLs can be conﬁgured for all routed network protocols.
■ACLs typically are used in ﬁrewall routers, which often are positioned between 
the internal network and an external network such as the Internet. 
■ACLs also can restrict virtual terminal access to the router.
■ACLs perform several functions within a Cisco router, including implementing 
security/access procedures.
■ACLs are used to control and manage trafﬁc.
■For some protocols, you can apply up to two ACLs to an interface: one inbound 
ACL and one outbound ACL.
■With ACLs, after a packet is checked for a match with the ACL statement, it can 
be denied or permitted the use of an associated interface.
■Wildcard mask bits use the numbers 1 and 0 to determine how to treat the corre-
sponding IP address bits.

Chapter 20: Access Control Lists
Key Terms
ACL (access control list)—A means of controlling or limiting network trafﬁc that com-
pares different criteria to a deﬁned rule set.
bit bucket—The destination of discarded bits (dropped packets), as determined by the 
router.
border router—A router situated at the edges or end of the network boundary, which 
provides basic security from the outside network or from a less controlled area of the 
network into a more private area of the network.
extended ACL—Compares source IP address, destination IP address, TCP/UDP port 
number, and other criteria to the rules deﬁning an extended ACL. 
exterior router—In ﬁrewall architecture, the router that is connected to the Internet is 
referred to as the exterior router. It forces all incoming trafﬁc to pass through the 
application gateway.
ﬁrewall—One or more network devices, such as routers or access servers, designated 
as a buffer between any connected public networks and a private network. A ﬁrewall 
router uses access control lists and other methods to ensure the security of the private 
network.
interior router—The router that is connected to the internal network. The interior 
router accepts packets only from the application gateway. The gateway controls the 
delivery of network-based services both to and from the internal network.
named ACL—ACL that allows standard and extended ACLs to be given names.
queuing—A process by which ACLs can designate certain packets to be processed by a 
router before other trafﬁc, on the basis of some conﬁgurable parameter such as speci-
fying a protocol.
standard ACL—ACL that compares source IP addresses to the rules deﬁning a stan-
dard ACL.

Rules of Structured Cabling for LANs
Structured cabling is a systematic approach to cabling. It is a method for creating an 
organized cabling system that can be easily understood by installers, network adminis-
trators, and any other technicians that deal with cables. 
The following three rules help ensure that the structured cabling design projects are 
both effective and efﬁcient:
■Look for a complete connectivity solution—An optimal solution for network 
connectivity includes all the systems that are designed to connect, route, manage, 
and identify structured cabling systems. A standards-based implementation will 
help to make sure that both current and future technologies can be supported. 
Following standards makes sure that the project will deliver performance and 
reliability over the long term.
■Plan for future growth—The number of circuits installed should meet these 
future requirements as well. Category 5e, Category 6, and ﬁber-optic solutions 
should be considered where feasible to ensure that future needs will be met. It 
should be possible to plan a physical layer installation that works for ten or more 
years.
■Maintain freedom of choice in vendors—Even though a closed and proprietary 
system may be less expensive initially, this could end up being much more costly 
over the long term. A non-standard system from a single vendor may make it 
more difﬁcult to to make moves, adds, and changes at a later time.

Subsystems of Structured Cabling
Seven subsystems are associated with the structured cabling system (see Figure A-1). 
Each subsystem performs certain functions to provide voice and data services through-
out the cable plant.

■The demarcation point (demarc) within the entrance facility (EF) in the equip-
ment room
■The telecommunications room (TR)
■Backbone cabling, also known as vertical cabling
■Distribution cabling, also known as horizontal cabling
■The work area
■Equipment room (ER)
■Administration
The demarc is where the outside service provider cables connect to the customer’s 
cables in the facility.
Backbone cabling is the feeder cables that are routed from the demarc to the equip-
ment rooms and then on to the telecommunications rooms throughout the facility. 
Horizontal cabling distributes cables from the telecommunication rooms to the work 
areas. The telecommunications rooms are where connections take place to provide a 
transition between the backbone cabling and horizontal cabling.
These subsystems make structured cabling, by nature, a distributed architecture with 
management capabilities that are limited to the active equipment (PCs, switches, hubs, 
etc.). Designing a structured cabling infrastructure that properly routes, protects, iden-
tiﬁes and terminates the copper or ﬁber media is absolutely critical for network perfor-
mance and future upgrade. 
Scalability
A LAN that can accommodate future growth in size is referred to as being scalable. It 
is important to plan ahead when estimating the number of cable runs and cable drops 
in a work area. It is always easier to ignore extra installed cables than to not have them 
when they are required. 
In addition to pulling extra cables in the backbone area for future growth, it is also 
common practice to pull an extra cable to each workstation or desktop for future use. 
This protects against pairs that might fail during installation and also provides for 
expansion.
Backbone Scalability
To determine how much extra copper cabling to pull, ﬁrst determine the number of 
runs that are needed now and then add some extra, about 20 percent. 
appen_a.fm  Page 882  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

Structured Cabling Systems, Standards, and Codes
883
One way to obtain this reserve capability is to use ﬁber-optic cabling and equipment in 
the building backbone. Updating the termination equipment (by inserting faster lasers 
and drivers, for example) can accommodate ﬁber growth.
Work Area Scalability
Although it might be obvious that each work area needs one cable for voice and one 
for data, other devices might need a connection to either the voice system or the data 
system. Network printers, fax machines, laptops, or another user in the work area all 
can require their own network cable drops. 
When the cables are in place, use multiport wall plates over the jacks. Many types of 
conﬁgurations are possible for either walls or partition walls. In addition, use jacks 
that are color-coded to make it easier to identify types of circuits. Administration stan-
dards require that every circuit should be clearly labeled to assist in connections and 
troubleshooting.
A new technology that is becoming popular is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). This 
technology allows special telephones to use data networks when placing telephone 
calls. A great advantage to this technology is the capability to avoid costly long-distance 
charges by using this service over existing network connections. Other devices, such as 
printers and computers, can be plugged into the IP phone. The IP phone thus becomes 
a hub or switch for the work area. Even if these types of connections are planned, enough 
cables should be installed to allow for growth. Especially consider that IP telephony 
and IP video trafﬁc may share the network cables in the future.
To accommodate the changing needs of users in ofﬁces, it is recommended to provide 
at least one spare cable to the work area outlet. Ofﬁces might change from single-user 
to multiuser spaces. In these cases, a work area can become inefﬁcient if only one set of 
communication cables were pulled. Assume that every work area could accommodate 
multiple users in the future (see Figure A-2).
Demarcation Point
The demarcation point (demarc), provides the point at which outdoor cabling inter-
faces with the intrabuilding backbone cabling (See Figure A-3). It represents the 
boundary between the service provider’s responsibility and that of the customer. In 
many buildings, this is near the point of presence (POP) for other utilities, such as 
electricity and water.

Structured Cabling Systems, Standards, and Codes
885
The local telephone carrier typically is required to terminate cabling within 15m (49.2 ft.) 
of building penetration and to provide primary voltage protection. This usually is 
installed and provided by the service provider.
The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and Electronic Industries Associ-
ation (EIA) develop and publish standards for many industries, including the cabling 
industry. To ensure that the cabling installation is safe, is installed correctly, and retains 
performance ratings, these standards always should be followed when performing any 
voice or data cabling installation or maintenance.
TIA/EIA-569-A speciﬁes the standards for the demarc space. The standards for the 
structure and size of the demarc space are based on the size of the building. In buildings 
larger than 2000 usable square meters, a locked, dedicated, and enclosed room is rec-
ommended.
The following are general guidelines when setting up a demarcation point space:
■Allow 1m2 of plywood wall mount for each 20m2 (215.3 ft2) area of ﬂoor space.
■The surfaces where the distribution hardware is mounted must be covered with 
ﬁre-rated plywood or plywood that is painted with two coats of ﬁre-retardant 
paint.
■Either the plywood or the covers for the termination equipment should be col-
ored orange to indicate the point of demarcation.
Telecommunications and Equipment Rooms
After the cable enters the building through the demarc, it travels to the entrance facility 
(EF), which is usually in the equipment room (ER). The equipment room is the center 
of the voice and data network. An equipment room is essentially a large telecommuni-
cations room that may house the main distribution frame, network servers, routers, 
switches, the telephone PBX, secondary voltage protection, satellite receivers, modula-
tors, high-speed Internet equipment, and so on. The design aspects of the equipment 
room are speciﬁed in the TIA/EIA-569-A standard.
In larger facilities, the equipment room may feed one or more telecommunications 
rooms (TR) which are distributed throughout the building (see Figure A-4).
A wiring hub and patch panel in a TR may be mounted to a wall with a hinged wall 
bracket, a distribution rack (see Figure A-5), or a full equipment cabinet.

■If the choice is a hinged wall bracket, the bracket must be attached to the plywood 
panel that covers the underlying wall surface. The purpose of the hinge is to allow 
the assembly to swing out so that workers and repairmen easily can access the 
back side of the wall. Care must be taken, however, to allow 48 cm (18.9 in.) for 
the panel to swing out from the wall.
■If you are using a distribution rack, it must have a minimum of 1 meter (3 feet) of 
workspace clearance in the front and rear of the rack. A 55.9-cm (22-in.) ﬂoor 
plate, used to mount the distribution rack, provides stability and determines the 
minimum distance for its ﬁnal position.
■If the patch panel, hub, and other equipment are mounted in a full equipment 
cabinet, they require at least 76.2 cm (28.6 in.) of clearance in front, for the door 
to swing open. Typically, such equipment cabinets are 1.8m high 
 
× .74m wide 
 
×
.66m deep (5.9 ft. 
 
× 2.4 ft. 
 
× 216.5 ft.).
Equipment must be placed in equipment racks with care. Considerations include whether 
the equipment uses electricity, cable routing, cable management, and ease of use. For 
example, a patch panel would not be placed high on a rack if a signiﬁcant number of 
changes were to take place after the systems were installed. Convenience of use is a 
large consideration when planning the equipment layout.
Scalability is also a consideration in an equipment layout because future growth should 
be accommodated. Space should be left on a rack for future patch panels, or ﬂoor 
space should be left for future rack installations in an initial layout. 
Proper installation of equipment racks and patch panels in the TR allows easy changes 
and modiﬁcations to the cabling installation in the future. This is important when con-
sidering the design and layout of the work areas.
Work Areas
The area serviced by an individual telecommunications room is called a work area. In most 
cases, a work area occupies one ﬂoor or part of one ﬂoor of a building (see Figure A-6).
The maximum distance for a cable from the termination point in the TR to the termination 
at the work area outlet must not exceed 90 meters (295 ft). This 90 meter maximum 
horizontal cabling distance is referred to as the permanent link. Each work area must 
have at least two cables, one for data and the other for voice. As previously discussed, 
accommodations for other services and future expansion must also be considered.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Figure A-6 Work Areas
This distance must be reduced because cables usually cannot be strung across the ﬂoor; 
they usually ride in wiring-management devices such as trays, baskets, ladders, and 
raceways. These devices route the paths of the wires above workspaces, often in the 
plenum areas above suspended ceilings. This means that the height of the ceiling times 
two (once up to the wiring management device and once back down) must be sub-
tracted from the proposed work area radius.
In addition, ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B speciﬁes that there can be 5m (16.4 ft.) of patch 
cord to interconnect equipment patch panels, and 5m of cable from the cable termina-
tion point on the wall to the telephone or computer. This additional maximum of 
10 meters of patch cords added to the permanent link is referred to as the horizontal 
channel. The maximum distance for a channel is 100 meters—the 90 meter maximum 
permanent link plus 10 meters maximum of patch cords.
Finally, the routes that the cables actually take might not be straight to the destination. 
Wiring-management devices can be costly, and the location of heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning equipment; power transformers; and lighting equipment can dictate 
paths that add length. This further decreases the radius of the work area. Typically, 
when everything is taken into account, the actual radius might be closer to 60 to 70m 
(196.9 to 229.7 ft.) than 100m (328.1 ft.); 50m (164 ft.) commonly is used as a work-
area radius for design purposes.

Servicing the Work Area
Patching is done when connectivity changes are needed often or are foreseen. It is 
much easier to patch cable from the work area outlet to a new position in the TR than 
it is to remove terminated wires from connected hardware and reterminate them to 
another circuit. Patch cords also are used to connect networking equipment to the 
cross-connects in a TR. Patch cords are limited by the TIA/EIA-568-B.1 standard to 
5m (16.4 ft.).
A uniform wiring plan must be used throughout a patch panel system. All jacks and 
patch panels should be wired using the same wiring plan. If the T568A wiring plan is 
used for the information outlets or jacks, T568A patch panels should be used. The 
same is true for the T568B wiring plan.
Patch panels can be for unshielded twisted-pair (UTP), shielded twisted-pair (STP), or 
ﬁber-optic connections. The most common patch panels are for UTP. These patch pan-
els use RJ-45 jacks; patch cords with RJ-45 plugs connect to these ports.
In most facilities, there is no provision to keep authorized maintenance personnel from 
installing unauthorized patches or installing an unauthorized hub into a circuit. There 
is an emerging family of automated patch panels, however, which can provide exten-
sive network monitoring in addition to simplifying the provisioning of moves, adds, 
and changes. These patch panels normally provide an indicator lamp over any patch 
cord that need to be removed, and then once the cord is released, provide a second 
light over the jack to which they should be re-afﬁxed. In this way, the system can auto-
matically guide a relatively unskilled employee through moves, adds, and changes. 
The same mechanism that detects when the operator has moved a given jack works 
also to detect when a jack has been pulled. An unauthorized resetting of a patch can 
trigger an event in the system log, and if need be, trigger an alarm. For example, if a 
half-dozen wires to the work area suddenly show up as being open, and it is 2:30 A.M., 
this is an event worth looking into, because theft may be occurring.
Types of Patch Cables
Patch cables (see Figure A-7) come in a variety of wiring schemes. The most common, 
the straight-through cable, has the same wiring scheme on both ends of the cable. In 
other words, pin 1 on one end is connected to pin 1 on the other end. Pin 2 on one end 
corresponds to pin 2 on the other, and so on. These types of cables connect PCs to a 
network hub.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Figure A-7 UTP Patch Cable
When connecting a communications device to a network hub, a crossover cable usually 
is used. Crossover cables use the T568A wiring plan on one end and T568B on the other.
Cable Management
Cable-management devices are used for routing cables and providing a neat and orderly 
path for the cables and to assure minimum bend radius is maintained. Cable manage-
ment also eases cable additions and modiﬁcation to the wiring system. Many options 
for cable management exist in the TR. Cable baskets can be used when an easy, light-
weight installation is needed. Ladder racks often are used when heavy loads of bundled 
cable need to be supported. Different types of conduits can be used to run cable inside 
walls, ceilings, and ﬂoors, or when they need to be shielded from external conditions. 
Cable management systems are used vertically and horizontally on telecommunica-
tions racks to distribute cable in a neat and orderly fashion (see Figure A-8). 
MC, IC, and HC
Most networks have more than one TR for various reasons. First of all, a medium or 
large network usually is spread over many ﬂoors or buildings. A TR is needed for each 
ﬂoor of each building (see Figure A-9). Second, media can carry a signal only so far 
before the signal starts to degrade or attenuate. Therefore, TRs are located at deﬁned 
distances throughout the LAN to provide interconnects and cross-connects to hubs 
and switches to assure desired network performance. These TRs house equipment, 
such as repeaters, hubs, bridges, or switches, that are needed to regenerate the signals.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Not all TRs are equal. The primary TR, called the main cross-connect (MC), is the 
center of the network. This is where all the wiring originates and where most of the 
equipment is housed. The intermediate cross-connect (IC) is connected to the MC and 
can house the equipment for a building on a campus. The horizontal cross-connect 
(HC) provides the cross-connect between the backbone and horizontal cables on a 
single ﬂoor of a building.
Main Cross-Connect
The MC is the main concentration point of an entire building or campus. In effect, 
the MC is the primary TR. It is the room that controls the rest of the TRs (the ICs and 
HCs) in a building or campus. In some networks, it is the place where the inside cable 
plant meets the outside world’s connectivity (the demarc). 
All ICs or HCs are connected to the MC in a star topology. Backbone cabling, or ver-
tical cabling, is used to connect those ICs and HCs located on other ﬂoors. Where the 
entire network is conﬁned to a single multistory building, the MC usually is located on 
one of the middle ﬂoors of the building, even though the demarc might be located in 
an entrance facility on the ﬁrst ﬂoor or in the basement. 
For networks that comprise multiple buildings, one building typically houses the MC. 
Each individual building typically has its own version of the MC, called the intermediate 
cross-connect (IC), which connects all the HCs within the building. The IC allows the 
extension of backbone cabling from the MC to each HC because this interconnection 
point does not degrade the communication signals. Only one MC can exist for the 
entire structured cabling installation. The MC feeds the ICs, and each IC feeds multiple 
HCs. There can be only one IC between the MC and any HC.
The backbone cabling (red lines in the ﬁgure) runs from the MC to each of the ICs. 
The ICs are located in each of the campus buildings, and the HCs serve work areas. 
Horizontal cabling, running from the HCs to the work areas, is represented by the 
black lines.
Horizontal Cross-Connect
The horizontal cross-connect (HC) is the TR closest to the work areas. Like all copper 
cross-connects, the HC is typically a patch panel or punch-down block, and possibly 
networking devices such as repeaters, hubs, or switches. It can be a rack mounted in a 
room or in a cabinet. Because a typical horizontal cable system includes multiple cable

runs to each workstation, it can represent the largest concentration of cable in the build-
ing infrastructure. A building with a 1000 workstations easily can contain a horizontal 
cable system consisting of 2000 to 3000 individual cable runs.
Horizontal cabling includes the copper or optical ﬁber networking media that is used 
in the area that extends from the wiring closet to a workstation (see Figure A-10). 
Horizontal cabling includes the networking medium that runs along a horizontal path-
way to the telecommunications outlet or connector in the work area, and the patch 
cords or jumpers in the HC.
Figure A-10 Horizontal Cabling and Symbols
Any cabling installed between the MC and another TR is known as backbone cabling. 
The difference between horizontal and backbone cabling is deﬁned clearly in the 
standards.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Backbone Cabling
Any cabling installed between the MC and another TR is known as backbone cabling. 
The difference between horizontal and backbone cabling is clearly deﬁned in the stan-
dards. Backbone cabling is also referred to as vertical cabling. It consists of the back-
bone cables, intermediate and main cross-connects, mechanical terminations, and 
patch cords or jumpers used for backbone-to-backbone cross-connection. Backbone 
cabling includes the following:
■TRs on the same ﬂoor (MC to IC, IC to HC)
■Vertical connection (risers) between TRs on different ﬂoors (MC to IC)
■Cables between TR and demarcation point
■Cables between buildings (interbuilding) in a multibuilding campus
The maximum distances for cabling runs vary from one type of cable to another. For 
backbone cabling, the maximum distance for cabling runs also can be affected by how 
the backbone cabling is to be used. To understand what this means, assume that a 
decision has been made to use single-mode ﬁber-optic cable for the backbone cabling. 
If the networking media were to be used to connect the HC to the MC, then the maxi-
mum distance for the backbone cabling run would be 3000m (9842.5 ft).
At times, the maximum distance of 3000m (9842.5 ft) for the backbone-cabling run must 
be split between two sections, as when the backbone cabling is to be used to connect the 
HC to an IC and the IC to the MC. When this occurs, the maximum distance for the 
backbone cabling run between the HC and the IC is 300 m (984 ft). The maximum dis-
tance for the backbone cabling run between the IC and the MC is 2700 m (8855 ft).
Fiber-Optic Backbone
Fiber optics are an extremely effective means of moving backbone trafﬁc. This is because 
optical ﬁbers are impervious to electrical noise and radio frequency interference. Fiber 
also does not conduct currents that can cause ground loops. Fiber-optic systems also 
have high bandwidth and can work at high speeds. This means that a ﬁber-optic back-
bone with certain characteristics that is installed today can be upgraded in the future 
to even greater performance when the terminal equipment is available. This can make 
ﬁber optic very cost-effective.
Fiber has an additional advantage when used as a backbone medium: It can go much 
farther than copper. Multimode optical ﬁber used as a backbone can support lengths 
of up to 2000m. Single-mode ﬁber-optic cables can go up to 3000m. Although optical 
ﬁber, especially single-mode ﬁber, can carry signals much farther than this (60 to 70 miles 
is feasible, depending on terminal equipment), these longer distances are considered to 
be out of the scope of LAN standards.

MUTOAs and Consolidation Points
Raised ﬂoors and dropped ceilings also can hold patch panels. These typically are used 
to house consolidation points or multiuser telecommunications outlet assemblies 
(MUTOAs).
Additional speciﬁcations for horizontal cabling in work areas with moveable furniture 
and partitions have been included in TIA/EIA-568-B.1. Horizontal cabling methodologies 
are speciﬁed for “open-ofﬁce” environments by means of MUTOAs and consolidation 
points (see Figure A-11). These methodologies are intended to provide increased ﬂexi-
bility and economy for installations with open-ofﬁce workspaces that require frequent 
reconﬁguration.
Rather than replacing the entire horizontal cabling system feeding these areas, a CP or 
MUTOA can be located close to the open ofﬁce area and eliminate the need to replace 
the cabling all the way back to the TR whenever the furniture is rearranged. The cabling 
only needs to be replaced between the new work area outlets and the CP or MUTOA. 
The longer distance of cabling back to the TR remains permanent.
Figure A-11 Typical MUTOA Installation
A MUTOA is a device that enables users to move and add devices and to make changes 
in modular furniture settings without rerunning the cable. Patch cords can be routed 
directly from a MUTOA to work-area equipment (see Figure A-12). A MUTOA loca-
tion must be accessible and permanent, and it cannot be mounted in ceiling spaces or 
under access ﬂooring. Similarly, it cannot be mounted in furniture unless that furniture 
is secured permanently to the building structure.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Figure A-12 Typical Consolidation Point Installation
When using MUTOAs, the TIA/EIA-568-B.1 standard speciﬁes the following:
■At least one MUTOA is needed for each furniture cluster.
■A maximum of 12 work areas can be used for each MUTOA.
■Patch cords at work areas shall be labeled on both ends with unique identiﬁers.
■The maximum patch cord length is 22m (72.2 ft.).
Consolidation points (CP) provide limited area connection access. Typically, a perma-
nent, ﬂush, wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, or support column-mounted panel serves 
modular furniture work areas. The panels must be unobstructed and fully accessible 
without moving ﬁxtures, equipment, or heavy furniture. Consolidation points differ 
from MUTOAs, in that workstations and other work area equipment do not plug into 
the CP like they do with the MUTOA. Workstations plug into an outlet that then is 
connected to the CP.
The TIA/EIA-569 standard speciﬁes the following:
■At least one CP for each furniture cluster
■A maximum of 12 work areas for each CP
■A maximum patch cord length of 5m (16.4 ft.)
For both consolidation points and MUTOAs, TIA/EIA 568-B.1 recommends a separa-
tion of at least 15 m (49 ft) equipment between the TR and the CP or MUTOa. This is 
to avoid problems dealing with crosstalk and return loss.

Structured Cabling Standards and Codes
897
Structured Cabling Standards and Codes
Standards are sets of rules or procedures that are either widely used or ofﬁcially speci-
ﬁed, and that serve as the gauge or model of excellence. Standards can take many forms. 
They can be speciﬁed by a single vendor or can be industry standards that support 
multivendor interoperability: 
■Standardized media and layout descriptions for both backbone and horizontal 
cabling
■Standard connection interfaces for the physical connection of equipment
■Consistent and uniform design that follows a system plan and basic design principles
Numerous companies, organizations, and even government bodies regulate and specify 
the cables in use. In addition to these organizations, local, state, county, and national 
government agencies issue speciﬁcations, requirements, and codes. 
The power of standards is this: The network that is built to standards should work well 
with, or interoperate with, other standard network devices. The long-term performance 
and investment value of many network cabling systems have been severely diminished 
by installers who do not know or who follow mandatory and voluntary standards.
It is important to understand that these standards constantly are being reviewed and 
periodically updated to reﬂect new technologies and the ever-increasing requirements 
of voice and data networks. Just as new technologies are added to the standards, others 
are dropped or phased out. In many cases, a network might include technologies that 
are no longer a part of the current standard or that are being eliminated. Typically, this 
does not require an immediate changeover, but these older, slower technologies eventu-
ally are replaced in favor of faster ones.
Standards often are developed by or at the direction of international organizations that 
try to reach some form of universal standard. Organizations such as the IEEE, ISO, 
and IEC are all examples of international standards bodies. These international stan-
dards organizations are composed of members from many nations, each of which has 
its own standards-making process.
In many countries, the national codes become the model for state/provincial agencies 
as well as municipalities and other governmental units to incorporate into their 
laws and ordinances. The enforcement then moves to the most local authority. Always 
check with local authorities to determine what codes are enforced. For the most part, 
local codes take precedence over national codes, which take precedence over interna-
tional codes.

Both the TIA and the EIA are accredited by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI, section 6.2.7) to develop voluntary industry standards for a wide variety of 
telecommunications products. This means that many standards often are labeled ANSI/
TIA/EIA. The various committees and subcommittees of TIA/EIA develop standards 
for ﬁber optics, user premises equipment, network equipment, wireless communications, 
and satellite communications. 
Although there are many standards and supplements, the following are used most 
frequently by cable installers (see Figure A-14).
Figure A-14 TIA/EIA Structured Cabling Standards
■TIA/EIA 568-A is the Commercial Building Standard for Telecommunications 
Wiring. The standard speciﬁes minimum requirements for telecommunications 
cabling, recommended topology and distance limits, media and connecting hard-
ware performance speciﬁcations, and connector and pin assignments. 
■TIA/EIA-568-B is the Cabling Standard. This standard speciﬁes the component 
and transmission requirements for media. TIA/EIA-568-B.1 speciﬁes a generic 
telecommunications cabling system for commercial buildings that will support 
a multiproduct, multivendor environment. TIA/EIA-568-B.1.1 is an addendum 
that applies to four-pair unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and four-pair screened 
twisted-pair (ScTP) patch cables bend radius. TIA/EIA-568-B.2 speciﬁes cabling 
components, transmission, system models, and the measurement procedures

environment, as well as the grounding practices for various systems that might be 
installed on customer premises. The standard speciﬁes the exact interface points 
between the building grounding systems and the telecommunications equipment 
grounding conﬁguration, and speciﬁes building grounding conﬁgurations needed 
to support this equipment.
European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization
CENELEC is known in English as the European Committee for Electrotechnical 
Standardization. It was set up in 1973 as a nonproﬁt organization under Belgian law. 
CENELEC develops electrotechnical standards for most of Europe; it works with 35,000 
technical experts from 19 European countries to publish standards for the European 
market. It has been ofﬁcially recognized as the European standards organization by the 
European Commission in Directive 83/189/EEC. Many CENELEC cabling standards 
mirror ISO cabling standards, with minor changes.
Although CENELEC and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) operate 
at two different levels, their actions have a strong mutual impact because they are the 
most important standardization bodies in the electrotechnical ﬁeld in Europe. Cooper-
ation between CENELEC and the IEC is described in what is known as the Dresden 
Agreement, approved and signed by both partners in that German city in 1996. This 
agreement was intended to expedite the publication and common adoption of interna-
tional standards and accelerate the standards preparation process in response to market 
demands. This agreement also was intended to ensure rational use of available resources. 
Therefore, full technical consideration of the content of the standard preferably should 
take place at the international level.

International Organization for Standardization
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international organiza-
tion composed of national standards bodies from more than 140 countries. For example, 
the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a member of the ISO. The ISO is 
a nongovernmental organization established to promote the development of standard-
ization and related activities. The ISO’s work results in international agreements, which 
are published as international standards.
The ISO has deﬁned a number of important computer standards, the most signiﬁcant 
of which is perhaps the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a standardized 
architecture for designing networks.
U.S. Codes
For some networking projects, a permit is required to ensure that the work is being done 
properly. Contact local zoning departments for information on permit requirements.
To obtain copies of local or state building codes, contact the building ofﬁcial for the 
local jurisdiction. All of the basic building codes—CABO, ICBO, BOCA, SBCCI, ICC, 
and so on—that are adopted throughout the United States can be purchased from the 
International Conference of Building Ofﬁcials (ICBO).
It is common for codes requiring local inspection and enforcement to be incorporated 
into state or provincial governments, and then possibly down to city and county 
enforcement units. Building codes, ﬁre codes, and electrical codes are examples. Like 
occupational safety, these were originally local issues, but disparity of standards and 
often lack of enforcement has led to national standards. When adopted by state or 
local authorities and enforced to appropriate levels, these standards then are turned 
over to the lower-level authorities for implementation.
Note that violating these codes often can be expensive in both penalties and delayed 
project costs.
Some codes are enforced variously by city, county, or state agencies. This means that a 
project within the city would be handled by the appropriate city agencies, while those 
outside the city would be covered by county agencies. For instance, ﬁre codes can be 
enforced by the county building permit department in some communities but by the 
local ﬁre department in others.
Although local entities inspect and enforce the codes, they often do not write them. 
Standards-making organizations frequently do that for them. For instance, the National 
Electrical Code is written to sound like a legal ordinance. This makes it possible for

government might fall behind. Always know which version of the NEC is in force for

Evolution of Standards
As network bandwidth has increased from 10 Mbps to 1000 Mbps and beyond, it has 
created new demands on cabling. Older types of cable are often inadequate for use in 
the faster modern networks. For this reason, the types of cabling used changes over time, 
and the standards reﬂect this. The following are the standards for TIA/EIA 568-B.2:
■For twisted-pair cables, only 100-ohm Category 3, 5e, and 6 cables are recognized. 
Category 5 cable no longer is recommended for new installations and has been 
moved from the body of the standard into an appendix. Category 5e or greater is 
now the recommended cable for 100-ohm twisted-pair cable.
■The Category 6 standard speciﬁes performance parameters that ensure that prod-
ucts meeting the standard are component-compliant, backward-compatible, and 
interoperable between vendors.
■When terminating Category 5e and higher cables, the pairs shall not be untwisted 
more than 13 mm (0.5 in) from the point of termination. The minimum bend 
radius for UTP horizontal cabling remains four times the cable diameter. The 
minimum bend radius for UTP patch cable is now equal to the cable diameter 
because it contains stranded wires and thus is more ﬂexible than solid-core 
copper cables used in horizontal cabling.
The acceptable length of patch cords in the telecommunications room has changed 
from 6m to 5m (19.7 ft. to 16.4 ft.) at maximum. The acceptable length of a jumper 
cable in the work area has changed from 3m to 5m (9.8 ft. to 16.4 ft.) at maximum. 
The horizontal segment distance remains at 90m (295.3 ft.). If a MUTOA is used, the 
work-area jumper can be increased in length if the horizontal length is decreased a 
corresponding amount to keep the total link segment length not longer than 100m 
(328.1 ft) (see Figure A-15).
The use of a MUTOA or consolidation point also mandates a separation of at least 
15 meters (49 ft) between the TR and the MUTOA or consolidation point in order 
to limit problems with crosstalk and return loss.
NOTE
Most countries have 
similar systems of 
codes. Knowledge
of these local codes 
is important if you 
are planning to do a 
project that crosses 
national boundaries.

Figure A-15 Changes to Horizontal Cabling Standards
All patch cords and cross-connect jumpers formerly were required to use stranded cable 
to provide the ﬂexibility needed to survive repeated connection and reconnection. The 
wording around this topic now has been changed from shall to should regarding stranded 
conductors. This allows solid conductor cord designs. 
Patch cords are critical elements in the network system. Language regarding the onsite 
manufacture of patch cords and jumpers still allows these cables to be created, but it 
now is strongly encouraged that network designers purchase cables that are premade 
and have been tested.
Category 6 and Category 7 are the newest copper cables available. Because Category 6 
cable is used more frequently, it is important for cable installers to understand its beneﬁts.
The signiﬁcant difference between Category 5e and Category 6 is the means used to 
maintain the spacing between the pairs inside the cables. Some Category 6 cables use a 
physical divider down the center of the cable. Others have a unique sheath that locks 
the pairs into position. Still other Category 6 cables use a foil screen that overwraps 
the pairs in the cable. The latter type of cable often is called screened twisted-pair 
cable, or ScTP.
To achieve even greater performance than Category 6, Category 7 cables that are avail-
able use a fully shielded construction that limits crosstalk among all pairs. Each pair is 
enveloped within a foil wrap, and an overall braided sheath surrounds the four foil-
wrapped pairs. A drain wire might be provided in future cables to facilitate grounding.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Standards for the structured cabling will continue to evolve. The focus will be on 
supporting the new technologies that are converging on the data network, such as the 
following:
■IP telephony and wireless utilizing a power signal in the transmission to provide 
power to the IP phones or access points.
■Storage area networking utilizing 10 GB Ethernet transmission 
■Metro Ethernet “last mile” solutions that require optimizing bandwidth and 
distance requirements
The standard for Power over Ethernet (PoE) is under development and will be available 
in the near future. PoE embeds a power signal on cables used for Ethernet transmissions. 
This power signal is used to free IP phones and wireless access points from the need for 
connection to AC power outlets, simplifying deployment and reducing costs.
Safety
Safety is an important concept containing information that often is overlooked in cov-
erage of low-voltage telecommunications wiring. Students not accustomed to working 
in the physical workplace will beneﬁt from labs and training. Other important safety 
topics include these:
■Safety codes and standards for the United States
■Safety around electricity
■Lab and workplace safety practices
■Personal safety equipment
Safety Codes and Standards for the United States
Most nations have rules designed to protect workers against hazardous conditions. 
In the United States, the organization charged with worker safety and health is the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Since the agency was created 
in 1971, workplace fatalities have been cut in half and occupational injury and illness 
rates have declined 40 percent. At the same time, U.S. employment has nearly doubled 
from 56 million workers at 3.5 million worksites to 105 million workers at nearly 
6.9 million sites.
It is OSHA’s responsibility to protect workers by enforcing U.S. labor laws. Technically, 
OSHA is not an agency related to building code or building permits. However, OSHA 
inspectors have the power to impose heavy ﬁnes and to shut down a job site if they ﬁnd 
serious safety violations. Anyone who works on or is responsible for a construction

site or business facility needs to be familiar with OSHA regulations. The organization 
offers safety information, statistics, and publications on its website.
MSDS
A material safety data sheet (MSDS) is a document that contains information on the 
use, storage, and handling of a hazardous material. It provides detailed information on 
the potential health effects of exposure and how to work safely with the material. It 
tells what the hazards of the material are, how to use it safely, what to expect if the 
recommendations are not followed, what to do if accidents occur, how to recognize 
symptoms of overexposure, and what to do if such incidents occur.
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc.
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL), is an independent, nonproﬁt product safety test-
ing and certiﬁcation organization. UL has tested products for public safety for more 
than a century. The UL focuses on safety standards but has expanded its certiﬁcation 
program to evaluate twisted-pair LAN cables for performance according to IBM and 
TIA/EIA (Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Alliance) 
performance speciﬁcations, as well as National Electrical Code (NEC) safety speciﬁca-
tions. The UL also established a program to mark shielded and unshielded twisted-pair 
LAN cables, which should simplify the complex task of making sure that the materials 
used in the installation are up to speciﬁcation. Listing by UL denotes initial testing and 
periodic retesting to ensure continuing conformance to standards.
The UL tests and evaluates samples of cable and then, after granting a UL listing, con-
ducts follow-up tests and inspections. This independent testing and follow-through 
make the UL markings valuable symbols to buyers.
The UL LAN Certiﬁcation Program addresses not only safety, but also performance. 
Companies whose cables earn these UL markings display them on the outer jacket 
(Level I, LVL I, or LEV I, for example).
National Electrical Code
The purpose of the National Electrical Code (NEC) is to safeguard persons and 
property from hazards arising from the use of electricity. This code is sponsored by 
the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) under the auspices of the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI). The code is revised every three years. 
Several organizations, including the UL, have established standards for ﬂame and 
smoke that apply to network cables laid inside buildings. However, the NEC contains 
the standards most widely supported by local licensing and inspection ofﬁcials.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
NEC Type Codes
NEC type codes are listed in catalogs of cables and supplies. These codes classify spe-
ciﬁc categories of products for speciﬁc uses, as shown in Table A-1.
Generally, interior network cables are listed in the category of type CM for communi-
cations or type MP for multipurpose. Some companies choose to run their cables through 
the testing process as remote-control or power-limited circuit cables CL2 or CL3 
(Class 2 or Class 3) general tests instead of through the CM or CP tests, but the ﬂame 
and smoke criteria is generally the same for all tests. The differences between these 
markings concern the amount of electrical power that could run through the cable in 
the worst case. MP cable is subjected to tests that assume the most power-handling 
capability, with CM, CL3, and CL2 going through tests with decreasing levels of 
power handling.
Safety Around Electricity
In addition to learning about the industry’s safety organizations, the cable installer 
should learn about basic safety principles that will be used every day on the job and 
that are also necessary for the curriculum labs. Because many hazards exist when 
installing cable, the installer should be prepared for all situations so that accidents or 
injuries can be prevented.
Table A-1 NEC Cable Type Codes
Type of Cable
Description
OFC (ﬁber optic)
Contains metal conductors inserted for strength.
OFN (ﬁber optic)
Contains no metal.
CMP (communication plenum)
Passed tests showing limited spread of ﬂame and 
low smoke. Plenum cable typically is coated with 
a special jacket material such as Teﬂon. The letter 
P in this code deﬁnes a plenum as a channel or 
ductwork fabricated for handling air.
CMR (communications riser)
The letter R shows that the cable has passed simi-
lar but slightly different tests for the spread of 
ﬂame and production of smoke, compared to CMP 
cable. For example, riser cable is tested for its 
burning properties in a vertical position. Accord-
ing to the code, you must use cable rated for riser 
service when the cable penetrates a ﬂoor and a 
ceiling. Riser cables typically have a polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC) outer jacket.

High Voltage  
Cable installers work with wiring designed for low-voltage systems. The voltage applied 
to a data cable would be hardly noticeable to most people. However, the voltage of 
network devices that data cables plug into can range from 100V to 240V (in North 
America). If a circuit failure allowed the voltage to become accessible, it could give the 
installer a dangerous shock—and it could be fatal. In addition, it is not unheard of for 
a low-voltage installer inadvertently to skin the insulation off existing high-voltage 
wiring and contact voltage that way. 
Do not become complacent about the hazards of high-voltage wiring nearby just because 
most of the work deals with low-voltage. If someone suddenly comes in contact with 
high voltage, that person might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to control his or her muscles or might 
not have the ability to pull away.
Lightning and High-Voltage Danger
High voltage is not limited to power lines; lightning is another source of high voltage. 
Because lightning can be fatal and also can damage network equipment, care must be 
taken to prevent it from entering the network cabling.
The following precautions should be taken to avoid personal injury and damage to 
network equipment from lightning and electrical shorts:
■All outside wiring must be equipped with properly grounded and registered 
signal circuit protectors at the point that they enter the building, known as the 
entrance point. These protectors must be installed in compliance with local tele-
phone company requirements and applicable codes. Telephone wire pairs should 
not be used without authorization. If authorization is obtained, do not remove or 
modify telephone circuit protectors or grounding wires.
■Never run wiring between structures without proper protection. In fact, protection 
from lighting effects is probably one of the biggest advantages to using ﬁber-optics 
between buildings.
■Avoid wiring in or near damp locations.
■Never install or connect copper wiring during electrical storms. Improperly pro-
tected copper wiring can carry a fatal lightning surge for many miles.
High-Voltage Safety Test
Voltage is invisible. Its effects are seen in tools that run, equipment that operates, or 
the unpleasant experience of getting shocked.
appen_a.fm  Page 907  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

908
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
When working with anything that plugs into the wall for power, it is a safety best prac-
tice to check for voltages on surfaces and devices before coming in contact with them. 
Using a known reliable voltage-measurement device such as a multimeter or voltage 
detector, take measurements immediately before starting work. Measure again whenever 
work is resumed the following day or after a break on any job; someone might have 
made changes. Recheck the measurements again when ﬁnished.
Some forms of electricity cannot be predicted. Lightning and static electricity fall into 
this category. Never install or connect copper wiring during electrical storms; copper 
wiring can carry a fatal lightning surge for many miles. This is particularly an issue 
with external wiring that is strung between buildings or underground wiring. Equip all 
outside wiring with properly grounded and approved signal circuit protectors. These 
protectors must be installed in compliance with the local codes, which, in most cases, 
align with national codes.
Grounding
Grounding works by providing a direct path to the earth for any voltages that come in 
contact with it. Equipment designers purposely isolate the circuits in equipment from 
the chassis—that is, the box where the circuits are mounted. Any voltage that leaks 
from the equipment to its chassis should not stay in the chassis. Grounding equipment 
conducts any stray voltage to the earth without hurting that equipment. Without a 
proper path to the ground, stray voltages use another path to the ground, such as a 
person’s body. 
The grounding electrode is the metal rod that is buried in the ground near the entrance 
point of the building—that is, the place where electricity enters a building. How the 
ground system connects to the earth is often another matter. For years, cold-water 
pipes, which enter the building from the underground water mains, were considered 
good grounds. Large structural members, such as I-beams and girders, were also 
acceptable. Although these might provide an adequate path to the ground, most local 
codes now require a dedicated grounding system, such as installed grounding conduc-
tors connecting equipment to grounding electrodes.
Be aware of the grounding system in the lab and on each job site. Verify that the ground-
ing system actually works. It is not uncommon to ﬁnd that grounding was improperly 
done or never was installed in the ﬁrst place. A more common situation occurs when 
an installer takes a few shortcuts and accomplishes a technically adequate ground, but 
in a nonstandard way. Later, changes to other parts of the network or to the building 
itself might destroy or eliminate the nonstandard ground system, leaving equipment 
and people at risk.

Bonding
Bonding involves providing a means for various wiring ﬁxtures to interconnect with 
the grounding system (see Figure A-16). It can be thought of as an extension of ground 
wiring. A device such as a switch or a router might have a bonding strap between its 
case and a ground circuit to ensure a good connection.
Figure A-16 Bonding
Properly installed bonding and grounding will accomplish the following:
■Minimize electrical surge (spike) effects
■Maintain the integrity of the electrical grounding plant
■Provide a safer and more effective path to ground
Telecommunications bonds typically are used in the following ways:
■Entrance facilities
■Equipment rooms
■Telecommunications rooms
Grounding and Bonding Standards
The National Electrical Code contains much information on grounding and bonding. The 
TIA/EIA standard on grounding and bonding, TIA/EIA-607-A, “Commercial Building 
Grounding and Bonding Requirements for Telecommunications,” extends grounding 
and bonding into the telecommunications structured cabling system. TIA/EIA-607-A 
speciﬁes the exact interface points between the grounding system of a building and the 
telecommunication equipment grounding conﬁguration. It supports a multi vendor,

be installed on customer premises. It also speciﬁes the necessary grounding and bond-

Lab and Workplace Safety Practices
Although cable installation is generally a safe profession, there are plenty of opportu-
nities for being injured. Many injuries are caused when installers come in contact with 
stray sources of voltage, called foreign voltages, such as lightning, static electricity, or 
other types of voltages caused by installation faults or induction currents that somehow 
ﬁnd themselves onto network cables.
When working in walls, ceilings, or attics, the ﬁrst thing that should be done is to turn 
off power to all circuits that might pass through those work areas. If it is not clear 
which wires pass through the section of the building being worked in, a good rule to 
follow is to shut off all power. Never touch power cables. Even if all power to the area 
has been shut off, there is no way to know whether circuits are still “live.”
Most countries have one or more agencies that develop and administer safety stan-
dards. Some of these are designed to ensure public safety; others are designed to pro-
tect the worker. Those that protect the worker usually cover laboratory safety, general 
workplace safety, compliance with environmental regulations, and hazardous waste 
disposal.
Workplace Safety
The following are guidelines for keeping a workplace safe:
■Before beginning work, learn the locations of all ﬁre extinguishers in the area. 
A small extinguishable ﬁre can get out of control if no one is able to locate an 
extinguisher quickly.
■Always ﬁnd out in advance what the local codes are. Some building codes might 
prohibit drilling or cutting holes in certain areas, such as ﬁrewalls or ceilings. 
The site administrator or facility engineer will be able to help determine which 
areas are off-limits.
■When installing cable between ﬂoors, use a riser-rated cable. Riser cable is covered 
with a ﬂame-retardant ﬂuorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) jacket and, therefore, 
will not allow ﬂames from one ﬂoor to use the cable to reach another ﬂoor.
appen_a.fm  Page 910  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

Lab and Workplace Safety Practices
911
■Outdoor cables typically have a polyethylene jacket (PVC). Polyethylene burns 
readily and gives off dangerous gases. NEC codes state that polyethylene building 
entrance cables cannot be exposed more than 15 m (approximately 49 ft.) into a 
building. If greater distances are required, the cable must be in metallic conduits.
■Consult the building’s maintenance engineer to ﬁnd out whether there is asbes-
tos, lead, or PCB in the working areas. If so, follow all government regulations in 
dealing with that material. These materials are called hazardous for a reason. No 
one’s health should be risked by working unprotected in these areas.
■Finally, if cable must be routed through spaces where air is circulated, be sure to 
use a ﬁre-rated cable (plenum-rated). The most common plenum cables are jack-
eted with Teﬂon or Halar. Plenum-grade cable does not give off poisonous gases 
when it burns, like regular cables, which have a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) jacket.
Ladder Safety
Ladders come in many sizes and shapes to be used for many speciﬁc purposes. They 
can be made of wood, aluminum, or ﬁberglass, and are designed for either light or 
industrial use. The two types that are the most common are straight ladders and step-
ladders. Regardless of the type or construction, be sure that the ladder has a label certify-
ing that it complies with speciﬁcations of the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI) and that Underwriters Laboratories (UL) lists it as passing its standards.
■Select the right ladder for the job. Be sure that the ladder is long enough to work 
from comfortably and is sturdy enough to withstand repeated use. Fiberglass ladders 
most commonly are used in cable installation. Although aluminum ladders are 
lighter, they are less stable and never should be used around electricity. When 
working near electricity, only ﬁberglass ladders should be used.
■Inspect the ladder ﬁrst. Any ladder can develop a problem that can render it 
unsafe. Inspect ladders for loose or damaged rungs, steps, rails, or braces. Make 
certain the spreaders on stepladders can be locked in place and that the ladder 
has safety feet that will provide more stability and reduce the chances of the 
ladder slipping while working. Never use a ladder that is defective.
■Stepladders should be fully opened with the hinges locked. Straight ladders should 
be placed at a 4:1 ratio. This means that the base of the ladder should be 0.25m 
(10 in.) away from the wall or other vertical surface for every 1m (3 ft.) of height 
to the point of support. If possible, secure a straight ladder as close to the point 
of support as possible, to prevent shifting. Ladders always should be placed on a 
solid, level surface.
appen_a.fm  Page 911  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

912
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
■Never climb higher than the second step from the top on a stepladder, or the third 
from the top on a straight ladder.
■Cordon off the work area with appropriate markers, such as trafﬁc cones or 
caution tape. Post signs so that people are aware of the ladder. Lock or block 
any nearby door that might swing toward the ladder if it opens.
Fiber-Optic Safety
Because ﬁber-optic cable contains glass, it is important to take appropriate precautions. 
The scrap material is sharp and must be disposed of properly. As with any glass product, 
when broken it, can cut or can splinter into tiny slivers that can get lodged in the skin.
These rules should be followed to avoid injury when working with ﬁber optics:
■Always wear safety glasses with side shields.
■Place a mat or piece of adhesive on the table so that all glass shards that fall are 
more easily identiﬁed.
■Do not touch eyes while working with ﬁber-optic systems until hands have been 
cleansed thoroughly. Similarly, do not handle contact lenses until hands have 
been washed thoroughly.
■Put all cut ﬁber pieces in a safe place and dispose of properly. 
■If some of the material gets on clothing, use a piece of adhesive or masking tape 
to remove it. Use tape to remove shards from ﬁngers and hands.
■No food or beverages in the work area should be allowed. 
■Do not look directly into the end of ﬁber cables. Some laser-driven devices could 
cause irreversible damage to the eye.
Fire Extinguisher Use
Never attempt to ﬁght a ﬁre without knowing how to use a ﬁre extinguisher. Read 
instructions beforehand and check the valve. In the United States, regulations state 
that ﬁre extinguishers used in commercial buildings must be checked at regular inter-
vals and replaced if they’re not in good working order. 
Fire extinguishers have labels that identify which kinds of ﬁres they are designed to 
ﬁght. In the United States, these are called ratings. Four different types of ﬁres have 
been classiﬁed in the United States:
■Class A ﬁres involve ordinary materials, such as burning paper, lumber, card-
board, plastics, and so on.
■Class B ﬁres involve ﬂammable or combustible liquids, such as gasoline, kero-
sene, and common organic solvents used in the laboratory.
CAUTION
If someone catches on 
ﬁre, remember the tip, 
“Stop, Drop, and 
Roll”:
• Stop, do not run. 
Fire spreads quickly 
if a burning person 
starts running. If a 
burning person 
panics and runs 
down the hall, 
tackle that person.
• Drop to the ﬂoor.
Roll on the ﬂoor to 
extinguish the ﬂames.

■Class C ﬁres involve energized electrical equipment, such as appliances, switches, 
panel boxes, power tools, hot plates, and most other electronic devices. Water is 
a particularly dangerous extinguishing medium for Class C ﬁres because of the 
risk of electrical shock.
■Class D ﬁres involve combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, potas-
sium, and sodium. These materials burn at high temperatures and react violently 
with water, air, and other chemicals.

Determine before you enter the workplace that you will work safely that day. Part of 
having a safe work attitude involves choosing to wear proper work attire. Wearing 
protective clothing or gear can prevent an injury or make an injury less severe. 
When working with power tools, for instance, it is important to protect eyes from ﬂying 
debris and ears from deafening noises. If goggles and earplugs are not used, eyesight or 
hearing could be damaged permanently.
Work Clothes
Long trousers and sleeves help protect the arms and legs from cuts, scratches, and 
other hazards. Avoid wearing excessively loose or baggy clothing because it might 
catch on a protruding object or get caught in power tools.
Wear shoes that are appropriate for the job. Sturdy, fully enclosed shoes should be 
worn. They should be able to protect the soles of the feet from sharp objects on the 
ﬂoor. Thick-soled shoes are best when working around nails, scrap metal, and other 
materials that could puncture the soles of regular athletic shoes. Steel-toed shoes can 
protect toes when a heavy object is dropped on the shoes. Also make sure that the 
soles have traction, to prevent slipping.
Eye Protection
Eyes are much easier to protect than to repair, so safety glasses should be worn when 
cutting, drilling, sawing, or working in a crawl space (see Figure A-17). With some 
cable-termination processes, as materials are cut, prepped, and discarded, there are 
opportunities for small particles to become airborne. While working with ﬁber optics, 
the glass ﬁbers, adhesives, and solvents can come in contact with the eyes. Also, small 
particles or chemicals might get on the hands and accidentally be rubbed into the eyes. 
Therefore, glasses also protect the eyes from contaminated hands. It is a good idea to 
wear safety glasses any time when working in a crawl space or above a dropped ceiling. 
If something falls from above, the eyes will be protected. Many job sites require safety 
glasses at all times.

Figure A-17 Eye Protection
Eye protection should be worn in all labs. Before starting any lab exercise, review the 
safety instructions and safety equipment needed. 
Hard Hat Use
As with all safety equipment, a hard hat protects the user from injury. Hard hats might 
be required at job sites, especially those involving construction. Many employers sup-
ply hard hats; others require installers to buy their own. The furnished hard hats might 
be of a company color or might be equipped with company logos to identify the wearer 
as belonging to a certain organization. Even if you are purchasing a hard hat for per-
sonal use, do not adorn it without obtaining permission from the employer. In addi-
tion, OSHA does not allow stickers on hard hats because they could hide cracks.
Periodically check the hard hat for cracks. A cracked hat might fail to protect a head. 
For hard hats to provide effective protection, they must be adjusted properly. Take the 
time to adjust the internal straps to make sure that they function and ensure that the 
hat ﬁts snugly and is comfortable. Hard hats are required when working on top of a 
ladder and often are required when working in new-construction environments.
Tools of the Trade
As with any craft, tools of the trade are often what makes the difference between a 
hard job with mediocre results and a simple job with outstanding results. Students 
should get hands-on experience with several of the tools used by low-voltage cabling 
installers to have professional results. 
Students should become versed in the following technologies:
■Stripping and cutting tools
■Termination tools

Stripping and Cutting Tools
Stripping tools are used to cut the cable jacket and insulation of the wires. The Panduit 
UTP cable-stripping tool (see Figure A-18) is used to remove the outer jacket from 
four-pair cables. It also can be used for most coaxial cable. The tool features an adjust-
able cutting blade to accommodate cables with different jacket thicknesses. The cable 
is inserted into the tool, and then the tool is twisted around the cable. The blade cuts 
through the outer jacket only, allowing the installer to simply pull the jacket off the 
cable to expose the twisted pairs. 
Figure A-18 Panduit UTP Cable-Stripping Tool
The electrician’s scissors and cable knife set (see Figure A-19) also can be used for 
removing cable jackets. The knife is used for removing the jacket from large cables, 
such as those that enter the building from the telco or ISP. This knife is sharp, so care 
should be taken when using this tool. It is recommended that gloves be worn when 
working with it, preferably gloves that will resist injuring the hand if the knife slips. 
The scissors can be used to cut individual wires, remove the outer jacket of smaller 
cables, and remove the insulation on individual wires. Not visible in the ﬁgure, the 
scissors features two different-size notches on the back of the blade that will strip 
insulation on wire sizes from 22- to 26-gauge.

Termination Tools
Termination tools are designed to cut and terminate speciﬁc types of cable. The multi-
pair termination tool (see Figure A-20) is designed to terminate and cut UTP cable and 
seat connecting blocks. This tool features an ergonomically designed handle that helps 
reduce fatigue when trimming wire or seating connecting blocks to the wiring base. 
Additionally, it has the following features:
■Terminates ﬁve pairs at a time 
■Terminates wires on both the cable side and the cross-connect side of connecting 
blocks
■Has replacement cutting blades available
■Can be used in the cut or noncut position
■Clearly displays CUT designation for proper orientation during termination
■Includes a reliable impact mechanism
■Has an ergonomically designed rubber handle with a ribbed edge that provides 
a no-slip grip
The impact punchdown tool (see Figure A-21) has interchangeable blades so that it 
can terminate wires on 66 and 110 hardware. Unlike the multipair termination tool, 
this tool terminates only one wire at a time. The reversible blades have a punch-and-
cut function on one side and a punch-only function on the other.

It is sometimes necessary to access individual wires inside a telecommunications outlet 
or jack. The modular adapter, or banjo, is used to provide access to these wires (see 
Figure A-22). A common line cord is plugged into the adapters and then into the jack. 
The technician can use an ohmmeter or other test devices without having to disassemble 
the jack. Banjos come in three-pair and four-pair conﬁgurations.

To locate metal pipes, wood studs or joists, or other hidden infrastructure behind a 
wall or under a ﬂoor, use wood and metal sensors. This should be done before drilling 
for any cabling project. A deep-scanning metal sensor can ﬁnd metal studs, conduit, 
copper piping, electrical lines, rebar, telephone lines, cable lines, nails, and other metal 
objects. This tool usually can scan through up to 15 cm (about 6 in.) of a nonmetallic 
surface, such as concrete, stucco, wood, or vinyl siding. It identiﬁes both the location 
and the depth of piping or rebar with an accuracy of about 30 cm (about 12 in.). 
Another type of sensor is a stud sensor (see Figure A-23). This sensor locates wooden 
studs and joists behind walls. This tool helps the installer make informed decisions 
on the best location to drill or saw when installing outlets or raceways. The stud and 
rebar sensor also detects metal and even can ﬁnd rebar embedded in up to 100 cm of 
concrete. All the modes detect AC wires to alert the installer, to prevent drilling or nail-
ing into a live electrical wire.

Installation Support Tools
A cable installer also will ﬁnd other tools useful. A measuring wheel is used to estimate 
the length of a cable run (see Figure A-24). The wheel has a counter mounted on the 
side. An installer simply rolls the wheel down the intended path of the cable. When the 
end is reached, the counter indicates the distance.
Figure A-24 Measuring Wheel
Cable installers also need tools and materials for cleaning up the job site. Brooms, dust 
pans, and vacuums make the cleanup process go quickly. Cleanup is one of the ﬁnal 
but important steps in completing a cabling project. A shop vacuum is designed for 
industrial or heavy-use jobs.
Fish Tape
One device speciﬁcally designed to make the retrieval of wires inside a wall a quick 
and easy process is ﬁsh tape (see Figure A-25). Fish tape can be run through walls or 
conduits. After running the ﬁsh tape to its intended destination of some convenient 
partway point, secure the cable to be pulled to the end of the ﬁsh tape. Retrieve by 
pulling and winding. The desired cable will come with it.
For cabling work, a ﬁberglass ﬁsh tape is safer than a steel one. Also, most seasoned 
cable installers pull a string along with their cables. This provides a convenient way to 
pull extra cables later.

Cable Tree
During the rough-in phase, cable trees, jacks, and rollers are used to support cable 
reels to make laying the cable faster and easier, and to prevent injuries. A cable tree 
supports a number of small reels of cable (see Figure A-26). This enables the cable 
installer to pull multiple runs of cable simultaneously. Because all cables terminate at 
the telecommunications room, a cable tree would be set up in the staging area. After 
cable is pulled to a jack location, the other end is cut from the reel and pulled into the 
telecommunications room.

Cable jacks and reel rollers are designed for large reels that hold backbone cabling. 
Because large reels are often too large and heavy to lift by hand, cable jacks provide 
the leverage that enable two people to raise them. After they are raised, the jacks allow 
the reel to rotate freely and safely during the pulling process.
Reel rollers also are used to support large cable reels. Rollers come in sets of two, each 
used to support one side of the reel. Rollers mounted on bearings allow the reel to be 
turned easily. When pulling from a reel roller, one installer generally is stationed at the 
reel, to assist in the turning of it.
Bullwheels
Bullwheels, in particular, normally are used to make the ﬁrst or last turn in the path, 
but they can be used to make an offset or turn in the center of the run.
A bullwheel is a large-diameter pulley that is used in a mechanical cable pulling pro-
cess. Bullwheels seldom are used when pulling cable by hand. The bullwheel itself gen-
erally is made of aluminum, is at least 0.3 m (about 1 ft.) in diameter, and is supported 
on some type of bearing on its frame. The bullwheel differs from a pulley, in that it 
often has two shackles for attachment to ﬁxed points. It also can be removed from its 
frame so that it can be put into a cable run from the middle of the cable.
Pulleys
Pulleys are used on long, open cable runs to support cables and prevent them from 
dragging on surfaces that could damage the cable sheath. They also are used on sur-
faces that could be damaged by pulling cable across them. Pulleys are used in straight 
cable runs to support the weight of the cable and reduce pulling friction. Pulleys also 
can assist with minor offsets in the cable run (see Figure A-27). 
Pulleys are used when pulling by hand or when using a cable puller or winch. When 
turns in the run exceed 45°, use bullwheels instead.
Pulleys are used for both multiple network cable runs and heavy backbone cable runs. 
Although lightweight pulleys can be used for network cable runs, heavy-duty pulleys 
should be used for backbone cables. Backbone cable pulleys have a larger frame, and 
the pulley wheel is a larger diameter.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Figure A-27 Cable Pull Using a Bullwheel and Pulleys
Wire Mesh or Kellem Grips
Wire mesh or Kellem grips are attached to the end of the cable so that a pulling rope 
can be tied to the end of the cable (see Figure A-28). The grip is slid over the end of the 
cable, and the last 15 cm (about 6 in.) are taped tightly with good-quality vinyl electri-
cal tape. As tension is placed on the cable, the grip draws tighter around the sheath of 
the cable. These grips are designed for single-cable use only; they generally are not to 
be used with a bundle of network distribution cables. These grips come in various sizes 
to accommodate different cable sizes. 
Kellem grips are also available in a split version, for where the end of the cable might 
not be accessible. These versions are used to pull additional slack in the middle of a 
cable run. Split grips also are used to support large backbone cables in a riser installa-
tion—that is, when cables are pulled between ﬂoors. To attach these split Kellem grips, 
the grip is opened and placed around the cable. A special rod then is threaded through 
the wire mesh.

Installation Process
923
Installation Process 
The installation process contains the many elements of an installation, starting from 
the rough-in phase, in which the cables ﬁrst are pulled into place. Riser cables are 
treated, as are the ﬁre stops used where a wire passes through a ﬁre-rated wall. Copper 
terminations are covered, as are wall adapters and other ﬁxtures.
Topics that will be treated here include these: 
■Rough-in phase
■Vertical cable installation
■Fire-stops
■Termination of copper media
■The trimout phase
Four phases cover all aspects of a cabling project: rough-in, trimout, ﬁnish, and customer 
support. The characteristics of each are as follows:
■Rough-in phase—In the rough-in phase, all of the cables are installed in the ceil-
ings, walls, ﬂoor ducts, and risers. 
■Trimout phase—The principal tasks during this phase are cable management and 
termination of the wires. 
■Finish phase—The principle tasks during the ﬁnish phase are performing cable 
testing, troubleshooting, and certiﬁcation. 
■Customer support phase—The ﬁnal phase of the project focuses on satisfying the 
customer. In this phase, a walkthrough of the network is done with the customer, 
and the customer is presented with formal test results and other documentation, 
such as as-built drawings. The customer then can sign off on the project if satis-
ﬁed. Afterward, the cable installation company provides ongoing support to the 
customer if there are problems with the cabling.
Rough-In Phase
The rough-in phase involves pulling the cable from a work area called the staging area 
to individual rooms or work areas. The staging area is generally an area just outside 
the telecommunications room. Each cable is labeled on both ends so that it can be 
identiﬁed. In the work area, enough cable is pulled so that there is plenty to work with 
when terminating. If the cable is to be run behind a wall, it is pulled out at the termina-
tion end so that it is ready for termination in the next phase.
In most cases, a new construction environment is less challenging than a remodeling 
project because there are fewer obstructions. Special planning usually is not required

924
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
in this environment because structures that will support cables and terminals generally 
are built as needed. However, coordination with other trades on the job site is essential. 
Other workers must be aware of data cable locations so that they can avoid damage to 
the newly installed cables. 
The staging area is where the cable installation operation is based. This area generally 
is situated near the telecommunications room, where one end of every cable is termi-
nated. Proper setup of equipment saves time during the cable-pulling process. Different 
types of cable runs require a different setup. Network distribution cabling normally 
requires a setup of multiple small cable reels. Backbone cabling, on the other hand, 
generally requires setting up a single large reel of cable.
Horizontal Cable Installation
Horizontal cable is cable that travels between the HC and the work-area outlet. The 
cable can travel either horizontally or vertically. When installing horizontal cable, it is 
important to follow these guidelines:
■Cables always should run parallel to walls.
■Cables never should be placed diagonally across a ceiling.
■When selecting the path for cabling, select the most direct path with the fewest 
number of turns.
■Do not have cables lying directly on top of ceiling tiles.
After the backbone cabling has been installed, the horizontal network-distribution 
cable must be installed. Network-distribution cable provides users and devices with 
network connectivity from the backbone cabling. Generally, this type of distribution 
cable is from workstations back to the TRs, where it is interconnected to the backbone 
cabling.
Horizontal Cable Installation in Conduits
Installing horizontal cables in conduits requires similar setups and procedures as install-
ing cables in an open ceiling. Pulleys are not needed for temporary support because the 
cables are supported within the conduits. Although the initial staging is the same, some 
special techniques and concerns must be considered when pulling cable in conduits.

The conduit must be large enough to handle all the cables that are being pulled. Con-
duits never should be ﬁlled to more than 40 percent of their capacity. Charts are avail-
able that give the maximum cable ﬁll or size for speciﬁc conduits. Next, the length of 
the run and the number of 90° bends in the conduit must be considered. Generally 
accepted practices are that conduit runs will be no longer than 30m (98 ft.) without 
a pull box, and a run of conduit shall have no more than two 90° bends. Large cable 
pulls require long radius conduits for the bends. The standard radius for a 10-cm 
(4-in.) conduit is 60 cm (24 in.). This is not adequate for large communications distri-
bution cables, such as those with at least 400 pairs. A minimum 90-cm (35-in.) radius 
conduit should be used in these larger pulls.
A specialized vacuum cleaner attachment can help with this (see Figure A-29). A spe-
cial foam-rubber missile, sometimes called a mouse, can be inserted into the conduit, 
with a light pull string tied to the missile. When the missile is lubricated slightly with 
common household liquid detergent, a high-powered vacuum cleaner, like those for 
commercial use, can draw the missile (with string attached) through an entire conduit 
run. Special attachments for the vacuum also can allow the missile to be blown through 
the conduit. For particularly difﬁcult runs, one vacuum can be set up to blow on one 
end and another can be set up to draw on the other. When the string has reached the 
other end of the conduit, it is used to pull a pull rope through the conduit. This, in 
turn, pulls the cable or cables.

Raceways
A raceway is a generic term for channels that contain cables in an installation. Raceways 
include common electrical conduit, specialized cable trays or ladder racks, in-ﬂoor 
duct systems, and plastic or metal surface-mounted raceways.
Surface-mounted raceways are used when there is no hidden path for the cable (see 
Figure A-30). Plastic surface-mounted raceways come in various sizes, to accommodate 
any number of cables. These are much easier to install than metallic conduits and are 
considered much more attractive.
Figure A-30 Raceways
Pulling Cable to the Jacks
At the work-area end of the cables, the cable must be pulled to the jack or outlet loca-
tion. If conduits are used to run behind the walls from the ceiling to the outlet boxes, a 
ﬁsh tape can be inserted into the outlet box at the end of the conduit and pushed up 
the conduit until it comes out into the open ceiling. The cable can be attached directly 
to the ﬁsh tape and then pulled down from the ceiling and out through the outlet box.
Some walls, such as concrete and brick walls, obviously do not have the cables run 
behind them. Surface-mounted raceways are used for these types of walls instead. Before 
cables are installed, the surface-mounted raceways should be secured to the wall fol-
lowing the manufacturer’s recommendations. After cable has been pulled through to 
the outlets, the cable installers return to the telecommunications room to ﬁnish pulling 
the cable at that end.

927
Fastening Cable
The ﬁnal step in the rough-in process is fastening the cables permanently. Many types 
of fasteners are available, such as J-hooks and hook and loop ties. Network cables 
never should be tied to electrical cables. Although this might appear to be the most prac-
tical approach, especially for individual cables or small bundles, it is a violation of the 
electrical code. Cables also should never to be tied to water or sprinkler pipes. 
Because high-performance networks cables have a minimum bend radius that cannot 
exceed four times the diameter of the cable, fasteners should be selected that support 
the minimum bend radius (see Figure A-31). Fastener spacing might be deﬁned in the 
job speciﬁcations. If no spacing is speciﬁed, fasteners should be placed at intervals no 
greater than every 1.5m (4.9 ft.).
Figure A-31 Panduit Hook and Loop Ties
If a cable tray or basket is installed in the ceiling, permanent fasteners are not needed.
Horizontal Cabling Precautions
Pulling cables can cause damage to the cable sheaths if care is not taken. Too much 
tension or making corners so tight they exceed the bend radius can decrease the ability 
of a cable to carry data. Installers stationed along the route of the pull should watch 
for snags and possible trouble spots before sheath damage can occur.
The following are several of the precautions that should be taken when pulling hori-
zontal cabling:
■As the cable enters the conduit, it can become caught or get scuffed on the end 
of the conduit. Use a plastic conduit guard or shoe to avoid this type of sheath 
damage.
■Extremely hard pulls around a 90° turn can cause cables to ﬂatten, even when 
using bullwheels and pulleys. If pulling tension is too great, shorten the length of 
the pull and do it in stages. Do not exceed 25 ft./lbs. of pull tension for twisted-
pair cable, or 50 ft./lbs. for ﬁber.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
■When pulling with a cable puller or winch, it is important to perform the pull in 
a single smooth action. When the pull has begun, if at all possible, continue the 
pull until complete. Stopping and starting can cause additional stress on the 
cable.

Safety Rules
Whenever working in walls, ceilings, or attics, the ﬁrst thing to do is turn off power to 
all circuits that might pass through those work areas. If it is not clear whether wires 
pass through the section of the building you are working in, a good rule to follow is to 
shut off all power.
Before beginning work, learn the locations of all the ﬁre extinguishers in the area. 
Wear appropriate clothing. Long pants and sleeves help protect arms and legs. Do not 
wear excessively loose or baggy clothing because it could catch on something. 
If working in a dropped-ceiling area, survey the area. Lift a few of the ceiling tiles and 
look around. This process will help you locate electrical conduit, air ducts, mechanical 
equipment, and anything that might cause problems later. 
Protect your eyes with safety glasses when cutting or sawing. It is also a good idea to 
wear safety glasses when working in a crawl space or above a dropped ceiling. If some-
thing falls from above, or in the dark, your eyes will be protected. 
Consult the maintenance engineer of the building to ﬁnd out whether there is asbestos, 
lead, or PCBs where the work is being done. If so, follow all government regulations in 
dealing with that material. 
Keep the work area orderly and neat. Do not leave tools lying in places where someone 
might trip over them. Use caution with tools that have long extension cords. They are 
easy to trip over.
To mount an RJ-45 jack in drywall, follow these steps:
1. Select a position for the jack that will be 30-45 cm (10–15 in) above the ﬂoor. 
Drill a small hole in the selected location. Check for any obstructions behind the 
hole by bending a piece of wire, inserting it into the hole, and rotating it in a 
circle. If the wire hits an obstruction, you must select a new location farther 
away from the ﬁrst hole. Then, perform the procedure again until you ﬁnd an 
unobstructed location. 
2. Determine the size of the opening you need for the box that will hold the jack. 
Trace an outline of the template that was included with the box or bracket. 
WARNING
Never, ever touch 
power cables. Even 
if you cut all power 
to the area you are 
working in, there 
is no way to know 
whether they are 
“live.”
NOTE
When working in 
walls, ceilings, or 
attics, it is extremely 
important to turn off 
the power to all cir-
cuits that go to, or 
pass through, the 
work area. If it is 
unclear whether wires 
pass through the sec-
tion of the building, a 
good rule to follow is 
to shut off all power.

3. Before cutting into the wall, use a carpenter’s level to make sure the opening 
will be straight. Use a utility knife to cut the opening. Push the knife through the 
drywall, inside the template outline, until you have an opening large enough to 
accommodate the blade of either a keyhole saw or a drywall saw. 
4. Insert the saw into the hole, and cut along the edge of the penciled outline. Con-
tinue cutting carefully along the line until you can pull out the piece of drywall. 
Make sure the box or bracket will ﬁt the opening. 
If you are using a box to ﬂush-mount the jack, do not secure the box until you bring 
the cable to the opening.
Mounting Jacks in Plaster
It is more difﬁcult to cut into a plaster wall than it is to cut into drywall. To achieve the 
best results, follow these steps:
1. Determine the appropriate location for the jack. 
2. Use a hammer and chisel to remove the plaster from the wall so that the lath 
behind the plaster is exposed. 
3. Use a utility knife to carefully trim plaster away from the lath. 
4. Place the template against the lathwork so that it overlaps three strips of lath, 
equally, at the top and bottom of the opening. Trace an outline around the 
template. Use an electric saw to cut away the full lath strip that is exposed in 
the center of the opening. 
5. Make several small cuts on the full strip, ﬁrst on one side and then on the 
other. Continue to make these small cuts until you completely cut through the 
center lath. 
Finish preparing the opening by removing the required portions of the lath strips at the 
top and bottom. Cut vertically along the sides of the hole, making several small cuts 
ﬁrst on one side and then on the other as before. Continue until the laths are notched 
evenly with the top and bottom of the hole. Now, cut a curve in the bottom piece of 
lath from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. Bottom out the curve so that it 
is ﬂat just before it gets to the corner. Remove the lath that should fall free when the 
cut reaches the corner. Turn the saw around and cut ﬂush along the bottom of the hole 
until you reach the opposite corner. The remaining lath should fall free. Repeat the 
process for the top piece of lath.
CAUTION
Be careful when 
doing this step. If you 
attempt to cut all the 
way through one side 
before cutting into 
the other side, the saw 
will cause the lath 
to vibrate when you 
make the second cut. 
This vibration can 
cause the plaster 
around the opening
to crack and separate 
from the lath.

Mounting Jacks in Wood 
To prepare wood for ﬂush-mounting a jack, follow these steps:
1. Select the position where you want to place the box. Remember, if you place 
the RJ-45 jack on a wooden baseboard, avoid cutting the box opening into the 
bottom 5 cm (1.5 in) of the baseboard. 
2. Use the box as a template, and trace around the outside. Drill a starter hole in 
each corner of the outline. Insert a keyhole saw, or jigsaw, into one of the holes 
and saw along the outline until you reach the next hole. Turn the saw and con-
tinue cutting until you can remove the piece of wood.
Flush-Mounting a Jack in a Wall
After preparing an opening in which to position the jack, place it in the wall. If using 
a box to mount the jack, hold the cable and feed it through one of the slots into the 
box. Then, push the box into the wall opening. Use the screws to secure the box to the 
wall’s surface. As you tighten the screws, you will pull the box tighter to the wall. 
If you are mounting the jack in a ﬂat, low-voltage mounting bracket, sometimes called 
a “wallboard adapter” or “old work box,” position it now. Place the bracket against 
the wall opening, the smooth side facing outward. Push the top and bottom ﬂanges 
toward the back so that the bracket grips the wall. Then, push one side up and the 
other down to securely mount the bracket.

At the work-area end of the cables, you must pull the cable to the jack or outlet location. 
If conduits run behind the walls from the ceiling to the outlet boxes, you can insert a 
ﬁsh tape into the outlet box at the end of the conduit and push it up the conduit until 
it comes out into the open ceiling. You can attach the cable directly to the ﬁsh tape and 
then pull it down from the ceiling and out through the outlet box. (See Figure A-32.)

Installation Process
931
If no conduits are in the walls, you can pull the cable behind the wall. First, cut a hole 
into the drywall at the location of the jack. You must take care to avoid making the 
hole too large. Drill another hole into the top plate of the wall. This hole should be 
1-2 cm (.39-.79 in) in diameter. Push a ﬁsh tape down through the top hole and ﬁnd it 
at the lower hole. Some installers use a weight and a string instead, which they drop 
down from the top hole and tie off so that it cannot accidentally drop down through 
the hole. At the bottom (outlet) hole, the installer can use a hook or a coat hanger to 
ﬁnd the string. 
Once you capture the end of the ﬁsh tape at the outlet location, tie a pull string to it. 
Then, pull the ﬁsh tape back up to the original location where the cables are tied to 
the pull string. Finally, pull the pull string down to the outlet location with the cables 
attached.
Some walls, like concrete or brick walls, will obviously not have the cables run behind 
them. These types of walls have surface-mounted raceways instead. Before you install 
cables, you should secure the surface-mounted raceways to the wall following the 
manufacturer’s recommendations. After you pull the cable through to the outlets, you 
return to the telecommunications room to ﬁnish pulling the cable at that end.
Fishing Cable from Below a Wall 
When running horizontal cabling in a building that has a basement, ﬁsh cable from 
there to the work areas on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. Do this by following these steps:
1. Drill a 3.2 mm (1/8 in) hole, at an angle, through the ﬂoor next to a baseboard. 
2. Push a coat hanger or stiff piece of wire into the hole to indicate the spot in the 
basement.
3. Go to the basement and locate the wire. 
4. Use a tape measure to mark a spot under the area of the wall. This mark should 
be 57 mm from the hole. 
5. Drill a new hole in this spot. This hole should be 19 mm in diameter. Unlike 
the ﬁrst hole that you drilled at an angle, drill this hole straight up through the 
subﬂoor and wall plate. 
6. Push the cable up through this second hole to the wall opening where you want 
to locate the work-area outlet.
7. Be sure to allow enough excess cable so that it can reach the ﬂoor and extend 
another 60-90 cm (2-3 feet).

Vertical Cable Installation
Pulling cables vertically is quite different from pulling cables horizontally. Vertical cable 
installation can include network-distribution cables and backbone cables. Although back-
bone cables can be pulled horizontally, they are considered part of the vertical distribu-
tion system. Network-distribution cables, on the other hand, are part of the horizontal 
distribution system.
Vertical installations generally are done in conduits, in conduit sleeves through the 
ﬂoors, or in slots cut through the ﬂoor. A rectangular opening in the ﬂoor is called a 
slot or a pipe chase. Risers are a series of holes in the ﬂoor, typically 10 cm (3.9 in.) in 
diameter, possibly with conduit sleeves installed (see Figure A-33). The conduit sleeves 
can protrude up to 10 cm (3.9 in.) above and below the ﬂoor. Not all risers are stacked 
perfectly above one another; sometimes they are offset, so riser alignment should be 
checked before the rough-in phase. 
Figure A-33 Typical Riser
Vertical cable installation takes place either from an upper ﬂoor to a lower ﬂoor or 
from a lower ﬂoor to an upper ﬂoor. In most cases, pulling cables from an upper ﬂoor 
to a lower ﬂoor is easier because gravity assists in the effort, and mechanical aids such 
as winches or cable pullers generally are not needed. Because it is not always possible 
to bring large reels of cable to upper ﬂoors in a building, in some instances vertical 
cables must be pulled from a lower ﬂoor. When pulling upwards, mechanical aids such 
as winches or cable pullers are generally not needed, but reel brakes are required to 
prevent a cable free fall.

Cable Winches
Vertical pulls require care when lowering cable so that the cable does not start paying off 
the reel too fast and falling out of control. A reel brake can help provide added tension. 
For lifting cables, a cable winch often is employed (see Figure A-34). Because the 
equipment used for pulling cable can pose a danger for both cable installers and 
onlookers, only members of the cable installation crew should be in the area. Pulling 
large cables with a cable winch creates a great deal of tension on the pulling rope. If 
this rope were to snap, someone in the area could be injured. Experienced cable install-
ers know that they should avoid being too close to the pull rope under tension.
Figure A-34 Capstan Winch
Cables can be ordered from the factory with a pulling eye installed, which is particu-
larly useful for large, heavy pulls. If this is not possible, a Kellem grip can be used. 
Again, when the pull begins, it should be a slow steady pull. The pull should not be 
interrupted unless absolutely necessary. When the cable is pulled into place, the pull 
rope and winch hold it in place until it is fastened permanently between ﬂoors using 
strut systems, friction clamps, or Kellem grips secured with bolts (see Figure A-35).
Fastening Vertical Cables
One method for fastening vertical cables is to use a split wire-mesh grip, like a Kellem 
grip, and a large bolt that is 25 cm to 30 cm (9.8 in. to 11.8 in.) long. It is important 
that the grip size be appropriate for the bundle of cables. While the winch or the reel 
brake supports the cable, a split wire-mesh grip is installed at each ﬂoor, and the bolt is 
installed through the loops in the grip. The cable then is lowered gently until it is sup-
ported by the grips. This is a permanent installation.

Cable Installation Tips
The following are tips for pulling cable:
■Whenever possible, the staging area should be close to the ﬁrst 90° bend. It is 
much easier to pull cable around a bend when it ﬁrst comes out of the box or off 
the reel than it is to pull it around a bend near the end of the pull. This is because 
the installer will be pulling the weight of all the cable pulled up to that point.
■Pulling lubricant should be used for long, difﬁcult pulls to prevent damage to 
cables.
■Adjust the reel so that cable comes off the top of the reel instead of from beneath it.
■If a ﬁsh tape appears to be stuck in a conduit bend, rotate the ﬁsh tape a few 
turns while pushing.
■Pull an additional piece of pull string with the cable. This can be used as a pull 
string if additional cables are needed later, eliminating the need to use a ﬁsh tape 
through this space again.
■If cable must be coiled on the ﬂoor for a secondary pull, coil the cable in a ﬁgure-8 
conﬁguration to eliminate tangles when uncoiling. Use two safety cones or even 
buckets as guides for coiling the cable.

■Supporting cables vertically through multiple ﬂoors can be a challenge. Run a 
steel strand or messenger between the ﬂoors, and anchor it at both ends. Vertical 
cable runs can be tie-wrapped to this steel strand for vertical support.
Fire-Stops
The choice of cabling materials and how they are installed can greatly affect how a ﬁre 
moves through a building, the type of smoke and gasses emitted, and the speed at which 
the smoke and ﬂames spread. Using plenum-rated cables where required, minimizing 
penetrations through ﬁre walls, and using proper ﬁre-stopping when penetration is 
unavoidable can reduce and slow the spread of smoke and ﬂames. It is usually smoke 
that kills, not ﬂame.
Firewall
A ﬁrewall is constructed out of special materials and techniques that resist the move-
ment of smoke and gasses from one area to another. Fire-rated walls also limit the 
spread of ﬂames from the area where a ﬁre originates into areas that are not affected 
directly. If an area does catch ﬁre, a ﬁre-rated wall slows the spread of ﬂames to new 
areas. These measures can protect building occupants and ﬁreﬁghters from being 
exposed to toxic smoke, as well as give them extra time to evacuate the building.
Firewall Penetrations
Sometimes cables must pass through a ﬁrewall. This requires making a special opening 
called a penetration (see Figure A-36).
Figure A-36 Typical Firewall Penetration
appen_a.fm  Page 935  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

936
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Several construction materials are used to construct ﬁrewalls. The most common used 
is likely drywall or sheetrock. When applied ﬂoor to ceiling, each layer of this material 
can resist the spread of ﬂame for roughly a half hour. Two overlapping layers provide 
protection for twice as long. Other common ﬁrewall materials include concrete blocks 
and poured concrete.
When cable is to be pulled through a ﬁrewall, a hole must be drilled through the ﬁrewall. 
This is called a penetration. Penetrations can go all the way through the ﬁrewall or can 
go through one side only. In this case, the penetration is called a membrane penetration.
After the hole is drilled, the penetration usually is sleeved. To do this, a small section of 
conduit is inserted in the hole. The conduit must be large enough to hold the cables, 
with extra room for additional cables in the future. This conduit also must protrude 
0.3m (11.3 in.) on both sides of the wall. Cables then are pulled through the conduit. 
After the cables have been pulled through the conduit, the conduit must be sealed with 
an approved ﬁre-stop material. This prevents ﬁre from spreading from one section of a 
building to another through the hole in the ﬁrewall.
When cables are installed in an existing ﬁrewall penetration, the ﬁre-stop material 
must be removed to clear space for the new cables. After the new cables have been 
pulled, the hole and conduits should be sealed with new ﬁre-stop material.
Terminating Copper Media
Communications cables are color-coded to identify individual pairs. The color-coding 
is the same for all telecommunications cables in North America. The use of color codes 
ensures uniformity in identifying individual cable pairs. Each colored cable pair is 
associated with a speciﬁc number. 
Four-pair Color Code
For most voice and data cabling, UTP cables are used. These cables have four pairs of 
twisted wires in each cable. The four pair color code is as follows:
■Pair 1—White/blue
■Pair 2—White/orange
■Pair 3—White/green
■Pair 4—White/brown
Pair 1 always appears on positions, or pins, 4 and 5 on an eight-pin jack or plug. Pair 4 
always appears on positions, or pins, 7 and 8 on an eight-pin jack or plug. The other 
pairs have different appearances depending upon the standard (either T568A or T568B) 
used for the wiring plan (see Figure A-37).

Installation Process
937
Figure A-37 TIA/EIA T568A and T568B Wiring Schemes
T568A or T568B always should be used for this wiring scheme. A new wiring scheme 
never should be created because each wire has a speciﬁc purpose. If the wiring is not 
correct, the devices on either end will not be capable of communicating or will experi-
ence severely degraded performance.
If the installation is in a new building, whether to use either T568A or T568B is likely 
to be dictated by contract. If the choice is left to the installers, use whatever scheme is 
most popular in the area. If there is existing wiring in the building that is either T568A 
or T568B, follow the existing scheme. Remember that every installer on the team must 
use the same wiring scheme.
Occasionally there is some confusion over pair numbers and pin numbers. A pin is a 
speciﬁc location on a plug or a jack. The colored pairs are always the same. For example, 
pair 2 is always the white/orange pair. On an RJ-45 jack, however, pair 2 may connect 
to pins 3 and 6, or to pins 1 and 2, depending on whether T568A or T568B is used.
RJ-45 Plugs and Jacks
RJ-45 jacks are eight conductor jacks that are designed to accept either RJ-45 plugs or 
RJ-11 plugs (see Figure A-38). Jacks should be wired to the T568A or T568B standards.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
RJ-45 plugs have eight pins that will accommodate up to four pairs of wires. As with 
RJ-11 plugs and jacks, pair 1 always is terminated on the center pins—in this case, 
pins 4 and 5. Pair 4 (white/brown) always is terminated on pins 7 and 8. Pairs 2 and 3 
might differ depending on the wiring plan. Using T568B, pair 2 (white/orange) termi-
nates on pins 1 and 2. Pair 3 (white/green) terminates on pins 3 and 6. T568A reverses 
pairs 2 and 3 so that pair 2 terminates on pins 3 and 6, while pair 3 terminates on pins 
1 and 2.
A RJ-45 jack terminates one end of the horizontal cable. The other end of the cable 
typically is terminated on a patch panel with a 110-style connector or a 110-style 
connecting block.
110-Block
110-blocks are high-density termination blocks suitable for either voice or data 
applications (see Figure A-39). The insulation displacement connection provides a low-
resistance gas-tight connection. 110-blocks come in many conﬁgurations. Blocks are 
designed to be stacked in different combinations to accommodate different size require-
ments. The 110 system includes wire-management troughs that also act as spacers 
between the blocks. 110-blocks can use a special multipunch tool that can punch down 
up to ﬁve pairs of wire at a time. Care must be taken to avoid using such a tool on patch 
panels that contain printed circuit boards, however, because the impact could damage 
the internal wiring.

The Trimout Phase
In the rough-in phase of cable installation, excess cable was left at both ends of the 
cable run. These coils of cable, which are used to take up slack and facilitate later 
changes, are known as service loops. Service loops are discouraged by EIA/TIA stan-
dards. It is not uncommon to have 1m (3 ft.) of ends hanging out of a wall jack at the 
ﬁnish of the rough-in stage. In the telecommunications room (TR), where hundreds of 
cables are terminated, it is not uncommon to have 2m to 3m (6 ft. to 10 ft.) of ends.
Although this practice appears to be wasteful, experienced installers know that an 
excess of cable provides more ﬂexibility in cable routing and provides greater access 
to cables when toning (testing) individual cables. A common mistake of new installers 
is to cut the cable short. Remember, excess can always be cut off, but a short cable can-
not be extended. If a cable is too short, the only alternative is to pull another cable, 
and this is a costly alternative in terms of labor and time.
If there is 1m (3 ft.) of cable coming out of the wall at the jack location, it is best to cut 
this back to about 25 cm (9.8 in.). A new label should be applied to the cable about 15 cm 
(5.9 in.) from the end. The jacket then should be stripped back about 5 cm to 7 cm (2 in. 
to 2.8 in.), exposing the individual twisted pairs. The completed jack termination should 
have no more that 1.5 cm (.6 in.) of unjacketed conductor exposed and no more than 
1.5 cm (.6 in.) of untwist in the cable pairs. Excess conductor length should be cut off 
at the ﬁnal termination (see Figure A-40).

multipunch tool.

940
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
The jack is terminated with approximately 15 cm to 20 cm (6 in. to 8 in.) of cable still 
protruding from the wall. This excess cable is coiled carefully into the wall or wall box 
when the jack is installed. This excess cable can be used to reterminate the jack at a 
later date or enable the removal of the faceplate and the addition of another jack to the 
outlet. At workstation terminations, it is common for the wires in the jack to lose con-
tact with the pins because the patch cord to the work area often is pulled, kicked, or 
stretched by the workstation users.
Terminate or Punchdown
The termination of communications cables at a TR is referred to as punching down. 
Cables also are punched down on termination panels mounted on wall ﬁelds and at 
the rear of cross-connect panels. 
Wires are inserted into the appropriate locations on termination panels, and then the 
punchdown tool is placed over the wires. Depending on the type of termination hard-
ware used, replaceable blades in the termination tool can changed out to accommodate 
the termination type (see Figure A-41). 
Figure A-41 Removable Termination Blade
As pressure is exerted on the tool, spring tension increases to a point at which a ﬁring-
pin type mechanism releases the energy stored in the spring. The wire instantly is forced 
between two insulation-displacement connections, and excess wire is cut off in the same 
operation. The connection is referred to as insulation displacement because the insula-
tion is pushed out of the way by the contacting points on the terminal. 
Insulation-displacement connections provide a secure, gas-tight connection, which 
means that the actual connection is not exposed to the atmosphere because the dis-
placed insulation presses tightly against the block. This is necessary to provide long-term 
corrosion-free connections. Patch panels typically are used for data networks, as are 
110-blocks, which also are used for voice applications.

Wire Management
Some termination systems come with a wire-management scheme built in. 110-blocks 
use plastic troughs and spacers between blocks. Troughs can be used both horizontally 
and vertically. Rack-mount installations incorporate a variety of wire-management 
features (see Figure A-42). Some use a combination of D-rings and troughs.
Figure A-42 Panduit Wire Management
When purchasing cable-management systems, consider the following:
■The system should protect the cable from pinching and should maintain the max-
imum bend radius.
■The system is scalable, so when more cables are needed, it can handle them.
■The system is ﬂexible, so cables can come into it from all directions.
■The system offers a smooth transition to horizontal pathways so that cable is not 
damaged or exceeds maximum bend radius.
■The system is durable, so it will last as long as the cables and equipment mounted 
on it.
Careful Labeling
Labeling is another important part of a structured cabling system. If cables are not 
labeled clearly on both ends, there can be confusion. TIA/EIA-606 speciﬁes that each 
hardware termination unit must have some kind of unique identiﬁer. This identiﬁer 
must be marked on each termination hardware unit or on its label. When identiﬁers 
are used at the work area, station terminations must have a label on the faceplate, the 
housing, or the connector itself. Most Requests For Proposals and speciﬁcations require 
that labels be computer generated so that they are permanent, legible, and more pro-
fessional in appearance.
appen_a.fm  Page 941  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

942
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Use labels that will remain understandable to someone who might work on the system 
many years in the future. Many network administrators incorporate room numbers in 
the label information. They assign letters to each cable that leads to a room. Some label-
ing systems, particularly those in very large networks, also incorporate color-coding.
To ensure that the labels do not rub off or get cut off (the end) later, mark the cable 
several times, approximately 60 cm (23.6 in.) apart, at the free end. After the cable 
is run, repeat the procedure at the box or spool end. To keep all cables tied securely 
together, use electrical tape. Bind the cable ends with the end of a pull string. Ensure 
that the pull string does not come loose by tying some half-hitch knots around the 
cables with the pull string before taping the ends. Do not skimp on the tape. If the 
string or cables pull out later, it could cost time and money.
After pulling the cable along the selected route, bring it into the TR. Allow enough 
cable for the ends to reach all the way to each jack location, plus enough excess or 
slack to reach the ﬂoor and extend another 60 cm to 90 cm (23.6 in. to 35.4 in.).
Go back to the spools of cable at the central point or TR. Use the labels on each spool 
as a reference, and then mark each cable with the appropriate room number and letter. 
Do not cut the cables unless they have a label. If each of these steps is followed, the 
networking media used for the horizontal cabling run should be labeled at both ends.
Finish Phase
The ﬁnish phase is the point at which installers test and, in some cases, certify their 
work. Testing makes certain that all the wires route to their appointed destinations. 
Certiﬁcation is a statement of the quality of the wiring and connection.
Important aspects of the ﬁnish phase include these: 
■Cable testing
■Time domain reﬂectometer (TDR)
■Cable certiﬁcation and documentation
■Cutting over
Diagnostic tools are important in determining existing and potential problems or ﬂaws 
in a network cabling installation.
Cable Testing
Cable testers are used to test cables for opens, shorts, split pairs, and other wiring prob-
lems. After the cable installer has terminated a cable, the cable should be plugged into 
the cable tester to verify that the termination was done correctly. If a wire accidentally 
appen_a.fm  Page 942  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

Finish Phase
943
was mapped to the wrong pin, the cable tester will indicate the wiring mistake. Similarly, 
it can test for problems with the cable, such as shorts or opens. A cable tester should be a 
part of every cable installer’s toolbox. After the cable has been tested for continuity using 
these cable testers, the cables can be certiﬁed by using certiﬁcation meters.
Testing is the most important step in the ﬁnish phase of cable installation. Testing veri-
ﬁes that all wires are working so that the customer does not ﬁnd that there are problems 
later. It is better to catch a problem before it becomes a major issue.
Tests relating to cable function are found in TIA/EIA-568-B.1. Common things to test 
for include the following (see Figure A-43):
■Opens—Wires in cables fail to make a continuous path from end to end. This is 
usually the result or improper termination or breakage. Occasionally it is 
because of faulty cable.
■Shorts—Wires in cables touch each other, shorting the circuit.
■Split pairs—Wires are mixed among pairs.
■Wire-mapping errors—Wires in a multipair cable do not terminate at the appro-
priate contacts in the connector at the far end.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
In most cases, simple functional testing for opens, shorts, split pairs, and wire-mapping 
errors are done from one end of the cable only.
Testing for Shorts
A short is formed when the two wires in a pair touch each other, providing an undesired 
shortcut in the ﬂow of signal (see Figure A-44). This shortcut is a completion of the 
circuit before the voltage reaches the intended target.
Figure A-44 Wire Short
To determine whether there is a short, measure the continuity or resistance between 
the wires. No continuity should be measured between them, and there should be an 
inﬁnite amount of resistance between them. Make these measurements with an ohm-
meter using a low-resistance scale. If a higher-resistance scale is used, the installer runs 
the risk of inadvertently measuring the installer’s own body resistance when the wires 
are held to the probes. Some installers ﬁnd it useful to create a small test ﬁxture to 
avoid this problem. Many test probes can be ﬁtted with slip-on alligator clips. They 
can hold one of the wires that so both leads are not touched at the same time.
Testing for Reversals
A reversal occurs when the tip (or ring) side of a pair is terminated on the ring (or tip) 
position at the opposite end of the wire (see Figure A-45).

Finish Phase
945
To repair a reversed pair in a cable, the RJ-45 connector must be removed and the 
cable end with the pair reversal must be terminated again.
Testing for Split Pairs
Split pairs happen when wires are mixed among pairs (see Figure A-46). One way to 
test for splits is with an ohmmeter. First, test the pairs for shorts. If none is found, 
place a short across each pair. When it is tested with an ohmmeter, ﬁnding a short is 
the anticipated result. If an open is found, something is wrong. The pair is either split 
or open. A tone generator then can be used to determine which is the case. Higher-end 
testers detect split pairs by measuring crosstalk between pairs.
Figure A-46 Split Pairs
A simple cable tester can be used to check for split pairs as well. This type of tester 
uses LEDs that immediately notify the installer if there is a problem with polarity or 
continuity.
To repair a split, one or both of the connectors must be removed and the cable end 
must be terminated again.
Time Domain Reﬂectometer
A time domain reﬂectometer (TDR) works by sending a pulse down the wire and then 
monitoring the electronic echoes that occur on the cable because of cable problems. 
TDRs determine whether there is a cable fault and, if so, whether it is an open or short; 
they also determine the distance from the meter to the fault. The signal is reﬂected 
back when it reaches the end of the cable, as well as anytime it encounters a defect in 
the cable along the way. The speed at which the signal travels is known as the nominal 
velocity of propagation. This is a known quantity for different cable types. When set,

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
the tester knows how fast the signal travels and can measure the length of the cable by 
measuring the amount of time that it takes for the signal to be sent and reﬂected back. 
A TDR readout typically is calibrated in feet or meters. This is an extremely efﬁcient 
means of locating cable problems, although the instrument must be adjusted properly 
and used with skill.
Cable Certiﬁcation and Documentation
Testing is not the same as certiﬁcation. Testing is for functionality—that is, it determines 
whether the wire can carry the signal from end to end. Certiﬁcation, or performance 
testing, is a statement about cable performance. It answers these questions: How well 
does the signal travel down the cable? Is the signal free from interference? Is the signal 
of adequate strength at the other end of the cable?
Certiﬁcation Tester
Certiﬁcation goes beyond functionality testing. Performance testing also must be done. 
Structured cabling systems that adhere to installation standards are required to be certi-
ﬁed. Certiﬁcation meters perform all of the required performance tests to adhere to the 
ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-B standards (see Figure A-47). Meters have an autotest function, 
so all required tests are performed with the touch of a single button. These tests include 
near-end crosstalk (NEXT), wire map, impedance, length, DC loop resistance, propaga-
tion delay, return loss, delay skew, attenuation, and attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio. These 
meters hold multiple test results in memory. Test results are downloaded to a computer 
so that a test report can be generated and presented to the customer. In addition to cer-
tiﬁcation, these meters include diagnostic features that not only identify problems, but 
also actually show how far these problems are from the end of the cable being tested.

Performance testing usually takes place at a designated test frequency. The frequency is 
selected to exercise the cable at a speed that will be part of its intended operation. For 
example, Category 5e cable is tested at 100 MHz, and Category 6 cable is tested at 
250 MHz. Performance testing is described in various addenda to TIA/EIA-568-B. 
Modern testing hardware and software can provide both text and graphic output. This 
allows ready comparisons as well as analysis at a glance.
The cable certiﬁcation process forms a baseline measurement for the cabling system. 
When the contract is established, the certiﬁcation standard to which the resulting job 
must conform usually is included as part of the contract. The installation must meet or 
exceed the speciﬁcations for the wire grade that is being used. Detailed documentation 
showing that the cabling has reached these standards is submitted to the customer. 
The certiﬁcation procedure is an important step in completing a cabling job. It enables 
the installer to say unequivocally that at a certain day and time, the cables performed 
to certain speciﬁcations. Any later change in cable performance must be attributable to 
some cause, and it will be easier to ﬁgure out what that cause is if there is hard, fast 
evidence of the cables’ condition at an earlier point. Different grades of cable require 
different minimum test results to be acceptable. Generally, the higher the cable cate-
gory is, the tighter the manufacturing tolerances are, the higher the quality is, and the 
better the performance is. 
Certiﬁcation Tests
To pass certiﬁcation, cables must meet the minimum test results for their grade. Cables 
must meet or exceed these speciﬁcations. Actual test results that outperform the mini-
mum often are encountered. The difference between the actual test results and the 
minimum test results is known as headroom. If the results show lots of headroom, less 
cable maintenance should be needed in the future, and the network should be more 
tolerant of poor-grade patch cords and equipment cables.
The commonly used speciﬁcations include these:
■Speciﬁed frequency range—Each cable is tested at a frequency range that it is 
most likely to be used in daily service. The higher the grade is, the higher this 
range is.
■Attenuation—The amount of signal that a cable will absorb is a measure of its 
attenuation. The lower the attenuation is, the more perfect the conductors are 
and the higher quality the cable is.
■Near-end crosstalk (NEXT)—Near-end crosstalk occurs when signals from one 
pair interfere with another at the near end of the cable. Crosstalk can affect the 
capability of the cable to carry data. The amount of NEXT that a cable must be 
capable of tolerating is speciﬁed for each grade.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
■Power Sum NEXT—In cables in which all the conductors are used (such as Giga-
bit Ethernet), the signals on one cable interfere with several pairs, not just one. 
Calculating the effect of these disturbances requires that the interactions of all 
pairs in the cable be taken into account. The power sum NEXT equation mea-
surement does this.
■ACR—The attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio (ACR) is an indication of how much 
stronger the received signal is when compared to the NEXT or noise on the same 
cable. Sometimes this measurement is referred to as the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR). Be aware that SNR takes into account external interference as well.
■Power sum ACR—When all of the pairs in a cable are used, the interaction 
between the pairs becomes more complicated. This is because more wires are 
involved, meaning that there are more mutual interactions. The power sum 
equations help take this greater mutual disturbance into account.
■Equal-level far-end crosstalk (ELFEXT)—Equal-level far-end crosstalk is a calcu-
lated measurement of the amount of crosstalk that occurs at the far end of the 
wire. If this characteristic is high, it means that the cable is not carrying the sig-
nals well and that the ACR (signal-to-noise) ratio is not well controlled.
■Power sum ELFEXT—As with the other power sum measurements, interaction 
among multiple pairs in the same cable increase the complexity of equal-level far-
end crosstalk characteristics. The power-sum version of the measurements takes 
this into account.
■Return loss—Some of the signal traveling down a wire bounces off imperfections 
such as impedance mismatches in the wire. It can be reﬂected back toward the 
sender and can form a source of interference. This is called return loss.
■Propagation delay—The electrical properties of the cable can affect the speed 
at which signals travel through it. The value of this delay must be known to 
perform certain measurements, such as time domain reﬂectometry. Propagation 
delay for cable usually is speciﬁed as a maximum allowable amount of delay, in 
nanoseconds.
■Delay skew—Because each pair in a cable has a different number of twists, signals 
that enter the cable at the same time are bound to be slightly out-of-sync when 
they get to the far end. This lagging and leading of signals on adjacent pairs is 
called delay skew. This problem can be heightened by sloppy termination, in 
which the cables are asymmetric with respect to the connector pins. Finally, if 
there is a difference in propagation delay between the wires in a cable pair, it 
could affect the signal because of delay skew.

Link and Channel Testing
Two methods are used when testing: the channel test and the link test. The channel test 
goes truly end-to-end from the workstation or telephone to the device in the telecom-
munications room (TR). The channel test measures all of the cable and patch cords, 
including the line cord from the jack to the user equipment and the patch cord from 
the patch panel to the communications equipment. Alternatively, the link test tests 
only the cable from the wall back to the patch panel. There are two types of link tests, 
the basic link test and the permanent link test. The basic link test allows no connec-
tors, but the point of measurement starts near the ﬁeld tester and ends near the ﬁeld 
tester remote unit at the other end of the link. The permanent link test excludes the 
cable portions of the ﬁeld test units, but includes the mated connection where the cable 
is connected to the adapter cable at each end (see Figure A-48). 
Figure A-48 Permanent Link Test
The permanent link test also allows for a consolidation point, which is desirable for 
open-ofﬁce cabling installations and is therefore more practical.
The only accepted test is the permanent link test. The channel test ofﬁcially has been 
eliminated by TIA/EIA-568-B.1.
Certiﬁcation Tips
How test results are interpreted is just as important as detecting problems. The best 
way to learn how to interpret test results is to use test equipment on known good wires 
and circuits. This will give the installer a knowledge base of how to properly use test 
equipment and how the test results should appear when the circuits are functioning 
properly. 
To gain experience with troubleshooting and problem identiﬁcation, create cables with 
speciﬁc problems. Observe how testers react to these problems. Practice identifying 
these problems based on the results of testers by randomly choosing cables. It will be 
worth spending the time now to be efﬁcient because the installer will want to be able 
to quickly determine what is wrong and ﬁx it.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Professional Certiﬁcation Documentation
Many cable certiﬁcation tools include the capability to export results in a database for-
mat. This can be used in a personal computer to produce high-quality documents (see 
Figure A-49).
Figure A-49 Cable Certiﬁcation Documentation
Installation software, generally provided with sophisticated certiﬁcation testers, enable 
the contractor to present the test result to the customer in an orderly and presentable 
manner. The software eliminates the need for entering the results by hand into a 
spreadsheet. Software packages store test results as either pass or fail. When deﬁciencies 
are found and corrected, items are retested and presented to the customer. Customers 
generally want both an electronic copy of the test results, as well as a paper copy.
Documentation must be accessible to be useful. Electronic delivery ensures that the 
results are always available to those who might need them. In addition, a paper set of 
both the as-built documents and the certiﬁcation results should be provided to the cus-
tomer, as well as retained in the installer’s permanent records. 
When a cabling system undergoes certiﬁcation testing, the test results should be collected 
to create the as-built documents. Certiﬁcation documentation can become important 
to an installer if there is a question about the quality or accuracy of the wiring job. It 
shows that on a certain date, the wires existed in a particular order and could carry 
signals at a particular quality. Changes over time that affect the cable’s capability to 
move signals can be illustrated by comparing current tests to previous ones.
Because of unexpected obstacles, change orders, and last-minute equipment upgrades, 
there is a possibility that the network wiring system documentation that was used to 
construct a facility wiring system is not representative of the system that actually was 
constructed. Anytime someone is asked to make a modiﬁcation to the wiring system, it

is imperative to know what really is going on in the system. Otherwise, making changes 
could have unpredictable effects. As-built documents can help avoid this kind of trouble. 
Always create change documents before actually making any changes.
Cutting Over
Cutting over is the term used when transferring existing services to a new cable system 
or when installing new equipment on a newly installed cable system. 
Cutover Guidelines
Good cutovers require careful planning, organization, and meticulous attention to 
detail. When cutting over, follow these guidelines to ensure success:
■Keep detailed records of the installation. Such records will verify that all cables 
have been installed and that they were installed in the correct location.
■Test every cable that is installed.
■Develop accurate cut sheets, charts of circuits and the cable or circuit on which 
they operate. The installation supervisor normally develops cut sheets with infor-
mation received by the customer.
■Schedule the cutover when it inconveniences the customer the least. Because 
cutovers usually require taking some systems ofﬂine, they often are scheduled 
late at night or on weekends.
Removing Abandoned Cable
When the National Electrical Code, edition 2002, is used, all abandoned cables must 
be removed when certain criteria deﬁned within the code is met. Currently, this is a 
decision that is made by the customer and the cable installation contractor regarding 
whether the cost involved in removing cables is justiﬁed. The customer and the con-
tractor must be sure to adhere to local code. Always check with the local authority and 
discuss the details with the customer before beginning the retroﬁt.
Before removing any abandoned cable, verify that no live circuits are on the cable. This 
is accomplished by checking with the customer and then verifying with either a multi-
meter or a telephone test set. Care must be taken not to damage ceiling tiles or dropped 
ceiling-support members when removing abandoned cable.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
The Cabling Business
The cabling business requires its share of attention, as does the business side of any 
other enterprise. Before cables can be installed, there must be a bid. Before there can be 
a bid, there must be a request for a proposal and walkthroughs to determine the pre-
cise scope of the work. Documentation both to describe the project and to show how it 
was actually built might be required. Licenses might be required to perform the work, 
as well as perhaps union membership. All projects must be performed in a timely manner, 
with minimal waste of time or materials. This is usually a job for project planning, 
using program-management applications.
Topics or particular importance in the cabling business ﬁled are these: 
■Site survey
■Labor situations
■Contract revision and signing
■Project planning
■Final documentation
As with most jobs, a cable installer’s appearance and demeanor can have an affect on 
how he is perceived by customers, bosses, and fellow employees. The choices that a 
cable installer makes on the job can affect whether he is promoted or even terminated. 
As an employee of a company, the cable installer represents that company on a job. 
His appearance and conduct reﬂects on the company. Therefore, you should always 
maintain a professional appearance and demeanor.
When working on a job, follow these guidelines:
■Respect the job site. Be careful not to cause damage or discard trash. Clean up all 
messes immediately if they affect another person, or clean them up at the end of 
the day.
■Come to the job site wearing clean, neat work clothes.
■Show up to a job at the agreed upon time. Punctuality is important.
■Be considerate of noise. If working on a retroﬁt project where business still is 
being conducted, avoid playing music, whistling, singing, or shouting.
■Treat customers, building occupants, co-workers, and bosses with respect.
Site Survey
The site survey, or project walk-through, is one of the most important events before 
preparing a cost estimate for the project. It gives the contractor the opportunity to see 
any issues that might impact the installation. Drawings and speciﬁcations supplied by 
the customer might not indicate problems or complications. 
appen_a.fm  Page 952  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

The Cabling Business
953
It is advisable to create a sketch of the project while conducting the walk-through. The 
sketch will be useful for identifying problem areas when it becomes time to actually 
perform the estimate.
A number of key questions should be asked on a site survey:
■Are there plenum ceiling areas?
■Is there a staging and storage area for materials?
■Are special work hours required?
■Are there special safety requirements? (This is particularly relevant in factory 
environments.)
■Which walls are ﬁrewalls?
■Is there asbestos in the building?
■Will the customer supply spare ceiling tiles in the event of breakage?
■Are there special labor issues to be considered?
Requirements Documents
The blueprints, which are scaled drawings, provide distance information required for 
determining the length of cable runs (see Figure A-50). Blueprints also should show 
service outlet locations and TRs. They will not always show available paths or routing 
information. Routing information generally is gathered through the site survey. Most 
structured wiring systems deﬁne a minimum of two four-pair cables per location, while 
many customers specify more. This information should be duplicated in the speciﬁca-
tions for the project.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Counting outlet locations and measuring cable distances on a blueprint are referred to 
as doing take-offs. Doing take-offs requires a great degree of accuracy because this 
gives the material requirements for the bid. Automated measuring devices are available 
to help minimize the chance for error.
Installation Icons and Symbols
Standard icons and symbols are used on blueprints and schematics to identify cable runs, 
different types of raceways, and information about outlets and jacks (see Figure A-51). 
They provide a uniform method of graphically identifying requirements on a blueprint.
Figure A-51 Cabling Installation Icons
Drawing Types
Construction blueprints follow a standardized format. Drawings are grouped accord-
ing to category. Drawings are labeled with a preﬁx that associates the drawings with 
the category. For example, all drawings that have to do with the electrical system are 
grouped together and have the preﬁx E for electrical. Architectural sections begin 
with A, plumbing begins with P, and so on. Telephone and data usually are grouped 
together and are represented on the T drawings, as follows:
■T0—Campus or site plans: exterior pathways and interbuilding backbones 
■T1—Layout of complete building per ﬂoor: serving zone boundaries, backbone, 
and horizontal pathways

There may be additional drawings, such as furniture plans. Furniture plans are found 
in either the A drawings or in a miscellaneous category.
Drawings that the estimator will require include the following:
■A site plan, to get an overview of the project
■Floor plans
■T drawings (telephone)
■E drawings (electrical), for reference
■Furniture plans to help determine outlet placement
■A drawings (architectural), for assistance with available pathways
Design documents provide a narrative describing the project. This might include a 
description of the functionality of the cabling system to be installed. It might include a 
statement such as “the system must support 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet on twisted 
pair).”
Design documents also usually include trade jargon and acronyms unique to an indus-
try or the system to be installed. The estimator should have a good understanding of 
all terms in the design document. Glossaries of terms and acronyms are available. The 
Building Industry Consultants Service International (BICSI) website includes a glossary 
of such terms and acronyms.
Design documents specify the requirements of the system and the types of materials to 
be used. Information on the number of cables required per information outlet or jack 
is supplied in the design document. Design documents also describe testing speciﬁca-
tions and labeling speciﬁcations and formats.
Schematic Diagrams
Schematic drawings are not to scale. They are used to depict connectivity—that is, the 
way things are connected. A typical schematic shows the main TR or main cross-connect 
(MC) and the intermediate cross-connect (IC). It shows the type and size of cables 
between these points. It generally does not detail the actual terminations at these 
locations, and it does not show individual cable runs to information outlets or jacks. 
It shows cable runs to speciﬁc pieces of equipment, such as servers or other major 
components that are used in the project.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Labor Situations
Every cable-installation company must deal with labor issues. Some of these issues can 
cause problems with unions. The installation company must be aware of the rules and 
regulations that cover things such as unions and licensing.
Unions
Some projects require the use of union labor. Unions are organizations that represent 
workers. Although the use of union labor is more common on new-construction projects, 
it is not limited to new construction. The use of union labor might be part of the con-
tract. If the customer clearly states that union labor must be used, the contractor must 
use union labor.
Other labor situations dictate the job classiﬁcation and the work that is allowed. In a 
union environment, supervisors normally are not allowed to perform installation work 
of any kind. Likewise, cable installers are not allowed to install raceway. Sometimes, 
cable installers can install raceway up to a certain size or a certain length; an electrician 
must install anything beyond that. These rules are deﬁned by a union agreement and 
often are determined by an agreement between unions of different trades.
Contractor’s Licenses
Not all countries or even all states require contractors to be licensed. In the United 
States, contractor license rules vary from state to state. Some states require the con-
tractor show that he is licensed by displaying the license number on all advertising, 
business cards, and letterhead. Contractors that operate without a license in a place 
where a license is required can be ﬁned for doing so. They also can lose certain rights, 
such as the right to ﬁle a lien if the customer does not pay for services rendered.
The requirements for a contractor to become licensed include technical knowledge, 
business knowledge, and knowledge of the labor laws of the state. It is the contractor’s 
responsibility to know whether he must be licensed in a particular state or country.
Contract Revision and Signing
When all the negotiations are complete, the contract must be revised to reﬂect the 
changes that both parties agreed to. Both parties still must review the contract in 
detail. Contract negotiation is a verbal event in which both parties must ensure that 
their intentions accurately are represented in the written document. Changes to the 
contract that occur as the project progresses often are addressed in amendments to 
the contract. Amendments are agreed to by both parties and signed by both parties.
appen_a.fm  Page 956  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

The Cabling Business
957
Responsible and authorized parties from the customer’s organization and the contractor’s 
organization must sign the contract before it is a valid agreement. When both parties 
have signed the contract, the commitment is made. No materials should be ordered 
and no work should commence before the contract is signed.
Common documents such as change orders can be created in advance as a template 
and simply ﬁlled in with the correct information. These templates can be taken along 
to the project site and ﬁlled out during the initial meeting or at the different walkthroughs.
Any changes to a project after it has been started should be made by written change 
order only. No changes to the original plan should be started by verbal instructions 
only; the contractor should have change order forms. The project manager should 
have these forms on the job site. Change orders that result in extra work should include 
the cost of the extra labor and materials, whenever possible. If this is not possible, the 
change order should include a statement that the customer agrees to pay for extra work.
Project Planning
The planning phase of a project actually begins after a project is awarded and before 
a formal contract is signed. Bidding and estimating information is assembled, special 
requirements are noted, resource allocations are made, and a ﬁnal review of the RFP 
takes place to make sure that all the components will be addressed.
The following are all steps that should be taken in this planning phase:
Step 1
The ﬁrst step in planning a cabling project is selecting the project 
manager or supervisor.
Step 2
Crews must be selected based on the size of the project, number of hours 
for completion, skills required, and time allowed for completion. 
Step 3
Subcontractors must be identiﬁed and scheduled. 
Step 4
Material delivery schedules must be made. 
Step 5
Provisions for waste disposal must be made.
Suppliers
The estimator normally selects suppliers on the basis of cost, delivery, and service. The 
estimator uses the following questions to determine the total cost of material:
■Does the supplier’s pricing include shipping?
■Does the supplier have a history of delivering goods at the time promised?
■What is the supplier’s policy on returned goods?
■Can the supplier provide cut sheets and engineering drawings in a timely manner?
■Can the supplier provide technical advice and support?

958
Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Ordering Materials
After the contract is signed, written purchase orders should be used to order materials 
from suppliers. Purchase orders should include the description of the material, the 
manufacturer’s part number, quantity, price, delivery date, and delivery location. 
Generally, the lowest-cost supplier that can provide the speciﬁed cable and equipment 
in the quantities that are required is the supplier to select. Shipping costs must be con-
sidered when evaluating the lowest cost. Supplier pricing should include a guarantee 
that the pricing will be ﬁrm for a speciﬁed period of time. Generally, suppliers guarantee 
pricing for at least 30 days. The supervisor or lead contractor must take care that no 
unapproved substitutions are made in an effort to reduce cost.
Final Documentation
Providing as-built drawings to the customer is one of the most important parts of 
completing a cabling project. The drawings show cable routes, termination points, 
and cable types as they actually were installed. In most cases, some cables are not 
installed as originally planned because obstructions or problems were encountered. 
Typical changes include adding or deleting cable runs or outlets, or routing cables by 
a different path. The as-built drawings give the customer a diagram of the work that 
actually was performed (see Figure A-52).

The Cabling Business
959
As-built drawings are not created until all cables are placed, all jacks are installed, and 
all cables are terminated. Drawing can begin while ﬁnal testing is taking place, but 
assurances must be made that no changes or additional work is done that is not reﬂected 
accurately in the drawings.
Floor plans, furniture plans, or T drawings usually are used as the basis for as-built 
drawings. The contractor is not required to redraw the building plans for the as-built 
drawings. The contractor draws all cable runs, terminations, and outlets, and supplies 
all labeling information as it was installed.
The punch list is the checklist that the customer provides the contractor with when the 
contractor considers the project complete (see Figure A-53). 
Figure A-53 Typical Punch List
The punch list is a list containing items that were not completed (missing outlets or 
cable runs, for example), items that were completed unsatisfactorily (cables not fastened 
to ladder racks or outlets that do not work, for example), or cleanup items (debris left 
in corridor, for example) that the customer requires corrected before approval for ﬁnal 
payment. The punch list can take the form of the customer’s ﬁnal acceptance of the 
project. When the items on the punch list are completed to the customer’s satisfaction, 
payment is expected.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Case Study: FARB Software Development, Ltd.: 
Network Design and Implementation
Lab exercises give you the opportunity to practice the manual skills portion of structured 
cabling installation. The case study is designed to give you a hands-on opportunity 
to participate in the design of a structured cabling system for a ﬁctitious software-
development company that is occupying a new three-story building and requires it 
to be built out. 
Overview
To complete this case study, you should be able to
■Gather information for the preinstallation process and lay plans for the 
installation process
■Create documentation as would be required for creating a real network
■Comply with TIA, EIA, and electrical standards
Using this supplement, as well as having mastered the CCNA 3 curriculum, will prepare 
you to complete many tasks related to real-world network creation. These objectives 
are spelled out within this case study in a letter from Cheryl Farb, president of FARB 
Software Development, Ltd., who, for this case study, is serving as the client company.
The following are some review items that will help you to focus on the case study.
General Design Process Framework
Network design is best done by following a framework. Determining where the wires 
go requires knowledge of the structure of the networks. You will need to know where 
the users are and what their applications are before you can begin to sketch out a 
viable network. A Layer 1 LAN logical and physical topology must be developed. This 
development includes the type of cable and the physical (wiring) topology that are 
selected, as well as the physical placement of infrastructure connection points on the 
network.
A Layer 2 segmentation plan must be overlaid on the previously created Layer 1 topology. 
This layer plan includes devices added to the topology to improve its efﬁciency and 
functionality. Examples of these devices might be switches and bridges. This layer also 
includes the use of technologies such as microsegmentation, virtual LANs (VLANs), 
and the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), to add efﬁciency and reliability.
A Layer 3 hierarchical plan then is overlaid on both of the previous two layers. This 
plan includes adding Layer 3 devices that will provide intranetwork and internetwork 
functionality to the network, as well as creating a network address plan. Layer 3 is

where routing and ﬁrewalls are implemented, imposing a logical structure on the net-
work. They also can be used for segmentation of both collision and broadcast domains.
An extension of the Layer 3 plan might be considered a Layer 4 plan. This plan could 
be laid over the ﬁrst three; it moves strictly to software and controls access and avail-
ability of the network. It involves access lists and ﬁrewall conﬁguration. Although a 
complete network design keeps moving up the OSI model, it is beyond the focus of this 
project.
This design focuses on Ethernet, IP, Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3, which is the focus 
of this curriculum. The design process logically ﬂows up the layers of the OSI model.
That said, it is important to remind ourselves of one of the purposes of structured 
cabling. The cabling system must be able to withstand change and growth over its life 
of service. Odds are good that most companies will be in different quarters by the time 
their structured cabling system is worn out. This means that care must be taken to not 
follow the current network layout so closely that the cables are not good for any other 
organization that may follow. An appropriate structured cabling system may be said to 
ﬁt the network today, but accommodate easily the network of tomorrow.
The most important—and, many times, the most neglected—part of network design 
and operation is the documentation. The main focus of this project is the documentation 
of the network design. Documentation for this project should include wiring maps, 
addressing schemes, any brainstormed ideas, problem-solving matrices, and any other 
notes made while making these determinations. 
Predesign Process
Before a network can be designed, the data needed to design the network must be 
gathered. For a network to be effective and serve the needs of its users, this data 
should be gathered according to a systematic series of preplanned steps. These steps 
provide a guide to completely discover the data needed to create the network.
The ﬁrst step in the process is to gather information about the organization. This 
information should include the following: 
■Organization history and current status
■Projected growth 
■Operating policies and management procedures 
■Building diagrams (blueprints)
■Existing network diagrams and documentation
■Ofﬁce systems and procedures 
■Viewpoints of the people who will be using the LAN

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
In the information packet that follows this section, you will ﬁnd communications from 
the president outlining FARB Software Development, Ltd. This document exists at 
FARB Software Development LTD.doc.
In this letter, Farb indicates her speciﬁc requirements for this project.
The second step is to make a detailed analysis and assessment of the current and pro-
jected requirements gathered in the ﬁrst step. This step identiﬁes and deﬁnes issues or 
problems that need to be addressed (for example, a remote room in the building might 
not have network access). It also provides information about future network expansion 
needs, access, and security.
The third step is to identify the resources and constraints of the organization. Organi-
zation resources that can affect the implementation of a new LAN system fall into the 
categories of hardware, software, and human resources. If this were a network expansion 
or upgrade, existing computer hardware and software would have to be documented. 
Identiﬁcation and deﬁnition of those projected needs also must be done. The answers 
to some of these questions also will help determine how much training will be required 
and how many people will be needed to support the LAN. The questions asked should 
include the following: 
■What are the ﬁnancial resources of the organization? 
■How are these resources currently linked and shared? 
■How many people will be using the network? 
■What are the computer skill levels of the network users? 
■What are the attitudes toward computers and computer applications? 
Following these steps, documenting the information in the framework of a formal 
report will help estimate costs and develop a budget for the implementation of a LAN.
Design Methodology and Deliverables
With the material that has been presented to this point, a strong foundation and 
understanding should have been developed for the concepts of a layered communica-
tions model. Using the OSI model as the framework, an understanding of the functions 
and devices that support operations at those layers also should have been gained. 
To perform this case study, material related to the physical design and installation of a 
network must be learned. As was presented in previous material, rules and standards 
govern how a network is designed and built. These rules and standards must be 
learned before the actual case study can be performed.

Students completing this lesson should be able to
■Develop a Layer 1 and 2 topology
■Gather information for both the preprocess and the process
■Create documentation during the course of the process
■Comply with TIA, EIA, and electrical standards
Note that this aligns with Farb’s requests for her company’s project.
Standards Organizations
When designing and building networks, it is necessary to ensure compliance with all 
applicable ﬁre codes, building codes, and safety standards. Perhaps the most important 
part of the network-design process is designing according to the EIA/TIA and ISO/IEC 
industry standards. The focus in this curriculum is on the standards for networking 
media that have been developed and issued by the following groups:
■ISO—International Organization for Standardization (not an acronym—see 
glossary)
■IEEE—Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
■UL—Underwriters Laboratories
■EIA—Electronic Industries Alliance
■TIA—Telecommunications Industry Association  
The latter two organizations jointly issue a list of standards called the TIA/EIA standards. 
In addition to these organizations, local, state, county, and national government agencies 
issue speciﬁcations and requirements that can impact the type of cabling that can be 
used in a local-area network.
It is also important to understand that these standards are being reviewed constantly 
and are updated periodically to reﬂect new technologies and the ever-increasing 
requirements of voice and data networks. Just as new technologies are added to the 
standards, others are dropped or phased out. In many cases, a network might include 
technologies that are no longer a part of the current standard or that are being elimi-
nated. Typically, this does not require an immediate changeover, but these older, slower 
technologies eventually are replaced in favor of faster ones.
Standards Deﬁnitions
The primary standards that will affect layer design have been created by the TIA/EIA. 
The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Electronic Industries Alli-
ance (EIA) are trade associations that jointly develop and publish a series of standards 
appen_a.fm  Page 963  Tuesday, May 20, 2003  4:54 PM

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
covering structured voice and data wiring for LANs. These industry standards evolved 
after the U.S. telephone industry deregulation in 1984, which transferred responsibility 
for on-premises cabling to the building owner. Before that, AT&T used proprietary 
cables and systems.
Both the TIA and the EIA are accredited by the American National Standards Institute 
(ANSI, section 6.2.7) to develop voluntary industry standards for a wide variety of 
telecommunications products. This means that many standards often are labeled ANSI/
TIA/EIA. The various committees and subcommittees of TIA/EIA develop standards 
for ﬁber optics, user premises equipment, network equipment, wireless communications, 
and satellite communications. 
TIA/EIA 568-A is the Commercial Building Standard for Telecommunications Wiring. 
The standard speciﬁes minimum requirements for telecommunications cabling, recom-
mended topology and distance limits, media and connecting hardware performance 
speciﬁcations, and connector and pin assignments. Several supplements cover some of 
the newer, faster copper media. This standard has been replaced by TIA/EIA-568-B. 
TIA/EIA-568-B is the Cabling Standard. This standard speciﬁes the component and 
transmission requirements for media. TIA/EIA-568-B.1 speciﬁes a generic telecommu-
nications cabling system for commercial buildings that will support a multiproduct, 
multivendor environment. TIA/EIA-568-B.1.1 is an addendum that applies to four-pair 
unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) and four-pair screened twisted-pair (ScTP) patch cables’ 
bend radius. TIA/EIA-568-B.2 speciﬁes cabling components, transmission, system mod-
els, and the measurement procedures needed for veriﬁcation of twisted-pair cabling. 
TIA/EIA-568-B.3 speciﬁes the component and transmission requirements for an optical-
ﬁber cabling system. 
TIA/EIA 569-A is the Commercial Building Standard for Telecommunications Pathways 
and Spaces. The standard speciﬁes design and construction practices within and between 
buildings that are in support of telecommunications media and equipment. Speciﬁc 
standards are given for rooms or areas and pathways into and through which telecom-
munications equipment and media are installed. 
TIA/EIA-606 is the Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure 
of Commercial Buildings, including cable-labeling standards. The standard speciﬁes 
that each hardware-termination unit must have some kind of unique identiﬁer. This 
identiﬁer must be marked on each termination hardware unit or on its label. When 
identiﬁers are used at the work area, station terminations must have a label on the 
faceplate, the housing, or the connector itself. All labels must meet legibility, deface-
ment, and adhesion requirements as speciﬁed in UL969.

965
TIA/EIA-607 is the standard for Commercial Building Grounding and Bonding Require-
ments for Telecommunications. It supports a multivendor, multiproduct environment, 
as well as the grounding practices for various systems that might be installed on cus-
tomer premises. The standard speciﬁes the exact interface points between the building 
grounding systems and the telecommunications equipment grounding conﬁguration, 
and speciﬁes building grounding conﬁgurations needed to support this equipment.
Electrical Safety
Generally, electrical current follows the path of least resistance. Because metals such as 
copper provide little resistance, they frequently are used as conductors for electrical 
current. Materials such as glass, rubber, and plastic provide more resistance and do not 
make good electrical conductors. Instead, these materials frequently are used as insula-
tors. They are used to insulate conductors to prevent shock, ﬁres, and short circuits. 
Many different shapes of electrical outlets exist throughout the world. Two of the three 
connection points provide the power circuit. The third connector protects people and 
equipment from shocks and short circuits. This connector is called the safety ground 
connection. In electrical equipment where this is used, the safety ground wire is connected 
to any exposed metal part of the equipment. If there is a wiring fault inside of the device, 
the ground connection protects people from exposure to hazardous voltages.
An accidental connection between the hot wire and the chassis is an example of a wiring 
fault that could occur in a network device. If such a fault were to occur, the safety ground 
wire connected to the device would serve as a low-resistance path to the earth ground. 
The safety ground connection provides a lower resistance path than the human body, 
thus reducing the risk of shock or electrocution. 
When properly installed, the low-resistance path, provided by the safety ground wire, 
offers sufﬁciently low resistance and current carrying capacity to prevent the buildup of 
hazardously high voltages. The circuit links directly to the hot connection to the earth.
Telecommunications Room Requirements
Layer 1 design is the largest component of the total network design. It involves the 
implementation of the preliminary designs gathered in the preprocess phase of the net-
work design to create the structured cabling system. This includes, but is not limited 
to, creating the logical topology, creating the wiring map, selecting wiring closets, and

selecting cable. This design must conform to the appropriate standards organization’s 
rules for design. 
Students completing this lesson should be able to:
■List location and design requirements for telecommunications rooms
■Explain cable-management design and speciﬁcation
■List considerations for selecting and installing equipment racks
■Explain key environmental, safety, and power considerations in telecommunica-
tions room location, design, and installation
Work-Area Cabling
Work-area cabling extends from the telecommunications outlet in a room to the user 
workstation. Work-area cabling is designed to be relatively simple to interconnect so 
that it can be moved or changed relatively easily. Each work area serves a maximum of 
10m2 of usable ﬂoor space.
Work-area equipment includes the following components: 
■Workstation equipment, such as computers, data terminals, telephones, fax 
machines, and printers 
■Cables, such as patch cables, modular cords, PC adapter cables, and ﬁber jumpers 
■Adapters external to the telecommunications outlet 
The TIA/EIA-568-B standard requires a minimum of two telecommunication outlets 
for each individual work area. The ﬁrst outlet must be a four-pair, 100 Ω unshielded 
twisted pair (UTP) or screened twisted pair (ScTP) cable and connector. Category 5e is 
recommended for this outlet. The standard allows three choices for the second outlet:
■Four-pair, 100 Ω UTP or ScTP cable and connector (Category 5e recommended)
■Two-ﬁber 62.5/125 µm or 50/125 µm optical ﬁber and connector
■150 Ω shielded twisted-pair (STP) cable and connector (not recommended for 
new installations)
Network Applications at FARB
Estimating the amount of trafﬁc that the network will carry requires you to understand 
the nature of the trafﬁc. Database transfers seem to take a lot of bandwidth, as does 
videoconferencing. Web applications are often gentle on bandwidth, with the excep-
tion of streaming audio and video applications. 
The IT staff at FARB has an accumulated a list of software applications frequently used 
by the staff. This is broken out by which group of users uses which application.

You can ﬁnd the information about FARB and software requirement list in the Case 
Study Materials section on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book.
Where Does It All Go?
FARB has not progressed in its planning to the point that you have been told which 
users get what seats, nor even which department gets which area of the building. You 
have been handed some fairly developed blueprints from which to begin your efforts. 
They are entirely adequate for locating the telecommunications rooms in the project. 
You can ﬁnd these drawings for desk assignments, plumbing and HVAC, rooms, and 
electric telephone and lighting, along with the building plan legend, roof cross-section 
end view and side view, in the Case Study Materials section on the CD-ROM that 
accompanies this book.
As is often the case, not all the information that you need is on any one drawing. Fur-
thermore, some of the drawings seem to be not useful to your requirements. Neverthe-
less, they are a good start toward designing a network to meet FARB’s requirements.  
Note that there is no indication of where the TRs should go, with the exception of the 
entrance facility, marked Point of Presence, on the ground ﬂoor. There is no indication 
of which areas of the building are to be occupied by which department. Consult the 
teacher or lab instructor of for this information.
The following section contains hints that should help students work out some of these 
issues.
Structured Cabling Case Study Hints
This case study will give you experience in practicing your networking and cabling 
skills. As you work through the study, you goal is to design the network layout for 
FARB Software Development, Ltd. You will reach this goal by performing several 
tasks involved in understanding the request for information and in deriving that infor-
mation from the drawings. 
Four layers of documentation are involved: 
1. A ﬁle that speciﬁes President Cheryl Farb’s idea for the network facility in the 
proposed new FARB building. 
2. A requirements document that has been worked up by the internal IP staff, of 
which you are a part. This lists what must be connected where. 
3. Several sets of drawings of each of the four ﬂoors of the building.

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
4. Some detail drawings to give you some idea of the methods of construction to 
be used. This will help you make decisions about cable routing. 
Take your time as you work through this case study. You will ﬁnd that much of the 
value will come from trying several different approaches. Discussion with class mem-
bers and teammates might help solidify your understanding of the important topics 
that this case study brings forward. 
Instructions:
Locate the letter to the internal support team from President Cheryl Farb. This docu-
ment shows ten items on which your ideas and input are requested. The last part of the 
letter includes a forecast of the company growth. 
Here are the ten items (some of them have several steps):
1. Recommendations of network equipment
2. Recommendations of network cabling
3. Any construction requirements
4. Network equipment locations
5. A wiring plan that includes the following:
— A horizontal and vertical logical layout
— A horizontal and vertical physical cabling layout
— A cabling plan for the server room
— Layouts of all MDFs and IDFs 
— Work-area cable outlet identiﬁcation plan
6. Security and ﬁre prevention recommendations for server room, MDF, and IDFs
7. Electrical protection for equipment
8. An IP addressing scheme for all devices on the network
9. A cost projection for the implementation of the network, including the following:
— Equipment purchase costs
— Cabling and testing costs
— Equipment installation costs
— Training and support costs
10. A timeline for the implementation of the network
Following is a study guide that contains hints to help you complete these tasks.

Where might you install the risers?
The horizontal cabling always should go parallel to walls. Getting to Room 1.2 while 
staying parallel to walls makes a cable run of how many meters? Is this useable?
Floor 2
Floor 2 is dense with ofﬁces. It also contains the bottom ﬂoor of an auditorium. Not 
only would the auditorium be a possible candidate for wireless, but it also might affect 
the routing of wires because it extends several ﬂoors in height. 
Where might you put the telecommunications room on Floor 2? You might consider 
using two of them.
Floor 3
Floor 3 has large unplanned spaces in Rooms 3.1 and 3.2. If you place the telecommu-
nications room in Room 3.10, how can you serve these spaces, especially the far side 
of Room 3.2?

Appendix A: Structured Cabling
Floor 4
You notice a large deck on Floor 4, as well as a banquet area with a piano. What 
would you need to provide network connectivity to this area?
Where will you put the TR?
You are now prepared to go to work. Count up the number of desks that would be 
served by each of these telecommunications rooms. Multiply by two outlets per desk. 
Divide this number by 16, round up as required, and order that many 16-port 
switches. That is your ﬁrst item for the network equipment list. 
You will need rack frames to support those switches. Order two frames per room to 
start.
Order patch panels to cover the number of speciﬁed lines. Remember that there is a 
certain amount of network equipment, such as, switches and routers that must ﬁt in 
these TRs. To calculate accurate totals, consider entering this information into a 
spreadsheet.
Network Cabling
You determined how many work-area outlets you needed for each TR in Step 1. Use 
cabling of a high grade, Category 5e or greater. Using a ruler, map out the routes for 
these runs and then pick off the dimensions. Add them all up, round up to the nearest 
1000, add 1000, and then divide by 1000. This is how much cable (1000-foot boxes) 
you need. 
It is important to pull cable efﬁciently. Avoid trying to get by with too few boxes or reels 
or else it may be necessary to duplicate runs. Pulling new cable over existing cables may 
result in damaging the cable that was pulled earlier.
There is a trick here. Look at drawings called FloorPlan2-Plumbing-and-HVAC-building 
ﬂoor4. This shows the water and air-conditioning duct work. Notice that there is both 
supply and return air. The ceiling is not a plenum ceiling. You can specify a cable that 
is not plenum or riser-rated. This will result in considerable savings.

Summary
973
Construction Requirements 
You determined that you needed risers between each ﬂoor. This requires coring and 
requires that the bottom ﬂoor will pass through the mechanical space. This will require 
conduit.
You also modiﬁed some rooms on the fourth ﬂoor by adding the TR. 
Next Steps
You now are prepared to work your way through most of the rest of the case study. 
Have fun. Relax. Remember that the thinking and planning and false starts and discus-
sion with teammates is where the true value of this exercise lies.
Summary
The standards are written in a way that will promote performance. Following stan-
dards also tends to unify the methods of construction and installation. For instance, 
the point at which a telecommunications utility enters the premises almost always is 
referred to as an entrance facility (EF). The point at which responsibility for the lines 
and equipment transfers from the network provider to the user is called the point of 
demarcation, or the demarcation point. The EF and the demarc usually are installed in 
a room created for that purpose, called a telecommunications room (TR). A TR can 
have one of several functions. A main cross-connect (MC) distributes the signals to one 
or more intermediate cross-connects (IC). These, in turn, pass the signal to one or 
more horizontal cross-connects (HC), which deliver the signal to the area near the end 
user, called the work area.
Work must be performed in a way that does not injure workers, the public, or the envi-
ronment. Often this requires marking off the work area with signs or cones to warn 
passersby. Also, ladder safety is an important practice. Ensure that ladders are in good 
condition, with no loose or broken portions. When deploying a straight ladder, secure 
it, if possible, near the point where it contacts a structure. If possible, have someone 
guard the base of the ladder, and by all means make sure that no one can open a door 
and knock you off of it. In the case of a stepladder, make sure that the feet ﬁrmly con-
tact the ground and that the spreaders are fully extended and latched. Do not use a 
stepladder as a straight one. Never stand on the very top of any ladder.
Cabling and wiring require tools adapted to the craft, and installers are well advised to 
use them and not get by with substitutes. Stripping tools take the insulation off pieces 
of wire, often in multiple levels to accommodate installing connectors. Cutting tools 
cut off pieces of wire, often in a way that does not compress the inside of the wires. A

termination tool is used to afﬁx a connector to a prepared cable end. These basic tools 
should be part of every installer’s kit, but perhaps more important are tools for diag-
nosis. A cable tester gives an indication that every pair is going to the correct place and 
that each wire is going to the correct terminal.
As the cables are pulled into place, it is important to keep in mind that ﬁrewalls must 
not be penetrated unless the equipment is available to restore them to their original 
condition. The ﬁre-stopping tools and materials that do this vary but generally consist 
of materials that are certiﬁed to resist the spread of smoke and ﬂame. Following the 
rough-in phase, cable is routed, terminated, and set into patch panels and cover plates 
in the trimout and ﬁnish phases. The ﬁnish phase is also the time during which cables 
are tested or certiﬁed. Certiﬁcation consists of passing specialized signals through a 
cable to determine whether the amounts of frequency-speciﬁc attenuation and head-
room are within tolerance. Certiﬁcation results usually are presented to the building 
owner as part of the cabling plant documentation.
There are no cabling jobs to be had if bids are not won, and accurate bidding requires 
a thorough site survey and careful estimating. Labor regulations and union restrictions 
might affect the timing of a project and should be taken into account. The external fac-
tors of each job can greatly affect the amount of proﬁtability that is expected. 
The study presented in this material involves using a company’s written requirements 
and a set of blueprints to develop the necessary plan, estimates, and documentation for 
a network installation in a four-story ofﬁce/warehouse complex.

packet might traverse before reaching its destination host.
Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
An IGP supplied with UNIX BSD systems. The 
most common IGP in the Internet. RIP uses hop count as a routing metric.
routing metric
A method by which a routing algorithm determines that one route is 
better than another. This information is stored in routing tables and is sent in routing 
updates. Metrics include bandwidth, communication cost, delay, hop count, load, 
MTU, path cost, and reliability. Sometimes simply called a metric.
routing protocol
A protocol that accomplishes routing through the implementation 
of a speciﬁc routing algorithm. Examples of routing protocols are IGRP, OSPF, and RIP.
routing table
A table stored in a router or some other internetworking device that 
keeps track of routes to particular network destinations and, in some cases, metrics 
associated with those routes.
routing update
A message sent from a router to indicate network reachability and 
associated cost information. Routing updates are typically sent at regular intervals 
and after a change in network topology. Compare with ﬂash update.

Answers to Hints in Appendix A
What is the purpose of this ﬂoor?
Answer: Warehouse, reception area
What door will workers move freight through?
Answer: The large garage doors at the rear of the building
What doors will visitors come in?
Answer: Front doors off lobby that has reception station in it.
Where are visitors most likely to go after they sign in?
Answer: The conference room adjacent to the reception area
Where would you consider using wireless technology?
Answer: Guests could log on to the Internet via wireless in the reception and 
conference areas. Warehouse staff could use wireless for inventory.
If your department someday is tasked with wiring IP security cameras, what areas 
would you want to keep under surveillance?
Answer: The two secure storage areas, the rear walkthrough door, and the 
reception area
From where does the telephone company serve this building?
Answer: There is a point of presence [POP] next to the mechanical room.
What kind of lock should it have?
Answer: A good one that can be opened from the inside
Would the POP be a good place for the servers?
Answer: Possibly—it is certainly big enough and is close to the elevators, for easy 
access.
If it is determined that the server room must exist separate from the POP, what consid-
erations should guide its location?
Answer: The location should be in a TR and should be on a middle ﬂoor.
Could you install the risers in the POP?
Answer: No. Check the ﬂoor above, and you will see that it has a conference room 
in that position.
Where might you install the risers?
Answer: There is a small hallway adjacent to each stairway. Check that out.

Appendix C: Check Your Understanding Answer Key
The horizontal cabling always should go parallel to walls. Getting to Room 1.2 while 
staying parallel to walls makes a cable run of how many meters? Is this useable?
Answer: The distance is about 94 meters. This is barely enough to make the run, go 
down the walls, and join a work-area connector. The designer must decide whether 
to cheat a little bit or to take advantage of the wireless system that is installed for the 
warehouse or conference room. This would present a security hassle but would solve a 
major problem.
Where might you put the telecommunications room on Floor 2? You might consider 
using two of them.
Answer: Room 2.31 because it offers ceiling access to Room 3.10 above and to the 
mechanical room below. You might need to add one at Room 2.7 to accommodate 
the ofﬁces against that wall.
Floor 3 has large unplanned spaces in Rooms 3.1 and 3.2. If you place the telecommu-
nications room in Room 3.10, how can you serve these spaces, especially the far side 
of Room 3.2?
Answer: Wireless is a good solution for now. Then when the rooms are built out, put a 
second telecommunications room in either of them.
You notice a large deck on Floor 4, as well as a banquet area with a piano. What 
would you need to provide network connectivity to this area?
Answer: You would need only one TR and some wireless to serve this area.
Where will you put the TR?
Answer: This is tough. Room 4.5 seems to be an ofﬁce. However, Room 4.8 is blank. 
Also, there is a hallway with an exterior door shown next to the staircase by Room 4.10. 
Because this is the fourth ﬂoor, you suspect an error. Furthermore, Room 4.10 is shown 
with a door facing into a stairwell. Chances are, you could mention these apparent 
errors and at the same time request that a TR be installed between Rooms 4.4 and 4.5.
