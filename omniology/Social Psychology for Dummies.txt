Social Psychology For Dummies

Introduction
T

he world is not short of advice. Self-help books, sermons, parents and 
celebrities regularly dispense advice on every aspect of your social life. 
If you want to know how to win friends and influence people, how to capture 
hearts and changes minds, how to believe in yourself or doubt other people, 
then someone will tell you five easy steps. But social psychology, and this 
book, offers you something better than advice. It can give you insight.
Social Psychology for Dummies uses the tools of science to understand why 
people behave as they do. Why they are attracted to some people, but not 
others? Why they are not convinced by an elegant political argument, but are 
persuaded by a celebrity endorsement. Where does prejudice comes from, 
and how does it influence our thoughts and actions? In this book, you will see 
how experimental methods can be used to reveal the inner workings of all of 
these psychological phenomena. And yes, there is a bit of advice too.
About This Book
Social Psychology for Dummies covers the full range of topics and phenomena 
that you would discuss in a typical university psychology course. However, it 
has been written with as little of the jargon and off putting technical terms as 
possible. There are no pre-requisites for this book. You will be able to under­
stand it with no exposure to psychology or scientific study before. A healthy 
curiosity about people is all that you need bring, and the book will provide 
you with an overview of one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of social 
science.
Social psychology is about the huge scope of human behaviour, but it is also 
about your behaviour. Wherever possible in this book, I’ve given you little 
exercises to try that are modelled on real psychology experiments. If you try 
them yourself you will be able to experience the social phenomena that you 
are learning about.
And one more thing: the Internet has forever changed the world of science 
and education. There are remarkable resources on-line for learning about 
social psychology, such as lecture courses, experiments you can participate

Social Psychology For Dummies 
in, and high quality blogs written by the scientists themselves as they carry 
out their research. But as with every aspect of the internet, the trick is know­
ing where the good stuff is and avoiding the rest. We provide you with an in 
depth list of the best resources to explore online.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I’ve made a few assumptions about you. Don’t think too 
badly of me. In particular, I’ve assumed that you:
)>>
✓)>>Are either a college student studying psychology who wants an acces­
sible guide to social psychology as an adjunct to your course reading, or 
a general reader who’s simply keen to know more about this fascinating 
area.
)>>
✓)>>Have a basic grasp of psychology in general, but are by no means a sub­
ject expert.
)>>
✓)>>Know that there’s quite a lot of psychological research behind all this 
but don’t necessarily want to plough through all of it.
)>>
✓)>>Will be highly selective about which parts of the book you read.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are handy little graphic images that point out particularly important 
information about social psychology. Throughout this book, you find the fol­
lowing icons, conveniently located along the left margins:
)>>
When you see this icon, you can expect to be surprised: It covers a range of 
widely-held beliefs and widely-believed stories, and hold them up to interroga­
tion. Things aren’t always what they seem . . .
)>>
Remember what follows this icon, as it is vital that you grasp these points to 
make sense of the rest of the chapter.
)>>
This icon directs you towards more detailed, technical information about the 
concept or experiments we are discussion. They provide nourishment for 
your inner science nerd.

 Introduction 
)>>
It’s all very well reading about other people’s thoughts and behaviour, but 
these little exercises allow to directly experience psychological phenomena 
for your self. If you see this icon, then get ready to put your own brain under 
the microscope!
)>>
Useful little wrinkles that help you gain understanding and insight.

Where to Go from Here

beginning of this book and work your way through to the end. Social psychol­
ogy covers a bewildering array of topics, methods and ways of understanding 
human behaviour. Simply turn the page and you’re on your way! If you have 
already taken some psychology classes, or are taking one right now, you can

S

ocial psychology is a fascinating science. It investigates feelings, thoughts, 
cultures and the ways that people relate to one another. Before social sci­
ence, these aspects of human life were discussed only in the context of art, 
religion and philosophy. But now, humans can generate scientific knowledge 
about their social selves.
In this chapter, I define the scope of social psychology, the sorts of behaviour, 
actions and thought processes that it tries to understand, and the tools that 
it uses. In its quest, social psychology has gobbled up ideas and techniques 
from the neighbouring sciences such as cognitive psychology, neuroscience 
and evolutionary biology. Although they have shifted during social psychol­
ogy’s short history, its goals have remained constant: To understand people 
and their relationships to each other.
Looking Down the Social Psychologists’ 
Microscope
What is the focus of social psychology? Is it thoughts in the mind, people in 
society or cultures across the world? It is all of these levels together. Imagine 
a giant microscope looking not at cells or creatures, but people. At the start 
of this book, I train this microscope on the smallest building blocks of social

psychology – the thoughts and attitudes that exist inside people’s heads and 
govern their behaviour. Then I zoom out to look first at the beliefs people 
have about other people, and then the ways that they exert power and influ­
ence over each other. In the final part of the book I zoom out again, and look 
at how people interact and relate, forming friendships, families and cultures.
So if it’s not a scale on a microscope, what defines the science of social psy­
chology? The boundaries are continually shifting, as they are in many active 
and developing sciences. But if you want a short, concise definition of the 
scope of social psychology, you can do no better that the definition Gordon 
Allport gave in 1954. He said that social psychology is:
The scientific investigation of how the thoughts, feelings, and behaviour 
of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence 
of others.
I’d like to highlight two aspects of this definition:
)>>
✓)>>What distinguishes social psychology from the rest of the field is the 
focus on cause and the effects of the ‘presence of others’.
)>>
✓)>>These other people do not have to be physically present. So you can be 
under the influences of social forces when you’re in the middle of a party 
or all alone. For example, I discuss conformity, obedience, and persuasion 
and authority in Chapters 12, 13 and 14, respectively, the power of stereo­
types in Chapter 10 and belonging to groups in Chapters 16 and 17.
To put it bluntly – if it is an aspect of human behaviour that involves more 
than one person, it is of some interest to social psychologists. Social psy­
chologists want to understand whom you like and whom you love, why you 
seek to help some people and harm others, what you think of yourself and 
what you think of other people, and the connections you make between your­
self and others. The next sections reveal in more depth the phenomena social 
psychologist study and the scientific tools that they employ.
Rummaging through the social 
psychologists’ toolkit
Social psychology is an interdisciplinary science. When you socially interact 
with another person, you are using your visual system to recognise their 
emotions, your auditory system to process their speech and your memory

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
systems to make sense of what they are saying and predict what they may 
say next. So to understand this social interaction, social psychologists can 
draw on the many fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience.
What’s more, during this social interaction, your behaviour is a precise and 
well-learnt ballet of co-ordinated actions – a polite incline of the head to show 
that you are listening, nodding and murmuring ‘uh-huh’ at precisely the right 
moments, and shifting your body posture to show that you accept what the 
other person says. All of these things you learnt as a child, and all of these 
things may be slightly different in different cultures. So to fully understand 
this social interaction, social psychologists may turn to developmental psy­
chology, cross-cultural psychology or even sociology or anthropology.
In Chapter 2 I examine how social psychology connects to these closely 
related disciplines. Also, I look inside the social psychologists’ tool kit to see 
how they developed their own tools such as surveys, interviews and field 
studies. But there is one tool that is so important to social psychology that it 
deserves a chapter of its own: the experiment.
Mastering the power of the experiment
Experiments are the most powerful tool that we have in social psychology, 
and indeed, in all of science. They allow us to make strong, lasting conclu­
sions. With an experiment, we can distinguish between two things that happen 
to co-occur, and one thing that causes another. For example, rich people tend 
to be less kind drivers. They are more likely to cut you up on the road. Is this 
because if you are a selfish driver, then you are more self-interested through­
out your life, and more likely to make money for yourself? Or does having 
money and owning an expensive car make you a meaner person? The surpris­
ing answer, as I discuss in Chapter 15, is that money and power can cause you 
to be less considerate towards others. It is only because of carefully designed 
experiments that we can make that bold claim.
Experiments get their power from careful design and analysis. In Chapter 3, 
I examine what makes a good experiment in social psychology, and what 
makes a bad one. As you will see, people who study chemistry and phys­
ics really have life easy. They are doing a simple science where you have to 
measure straightforward things like mass, heat and velocity. But in social psy­
chology we have to measure things such as happiness, prejudice and a sense 
of belonging. There is no stereotype-o-meter for prejudice in the same way 
that there is a thermometer for heat. So, as I will show you, social psycholo­
gists have to be clever and creative in the ways that they do their science.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Digging for the foundations 
of social psychology
To understand the way that we do social psychology today, you have to 
understand the past. As much as social psychology studies phenomena such 
as conflict, aggression and prejudice, it is also the outcome of events in real 
life such as the Second World War and the Holocaust. Also, social psychol­
ogy is a child of psychology itself. In the recent past, psychology conceived 
of people as very different things – as learning machines, as computers, as 
social beings and as sets of competing desires. The way that psychology has 
defined people has had profound consequences for the way that social psy­
chology studies the interaction between people.
No couches here!
This sidebar is the only place in the whole book 
that I talk about Sigmund Freud. This may seem 
very strange to non-psychologists, who often 
assume that he is the dominant figure in psy­
chology. Indeed, if you tell people that you are 
currently studying psychology, the first thing 
that they may say is, ‘Oh don’t analyse me!’ (This 
will quickly become tiresome for you). In fact, 
Freud is a marginal figure, at best, in contem­
porary empirical psychology. His ideas had an 
enormous influence on popular culture and the 
novels and films at the time. And his ideas on 
therapy had a lasting influence on psychiatry, 
although few people follow his original theories 
now. The traces of his ideas that remain in psy­
chology are often unhelpful. For example, some 
parenting books tell parents not to hug their 
young babies too much during the first months 
of life. The reason for this advice can be traced 
to Freud’s belief that unconditional love from a 
mother could produce an over-dependent child 
that never frees itself from the mother’s influ­
ence. Now we know (from doing the hard work 
of studies and experiments) that this is non­
sense, and parental affection has no such nega­
tive effects on an infant. Similarly, there is simply 
no evidence for most of Freud’s specific theories 
about unconscious drives and the causal influ­
ences a parent’s actions have upon a child.
In short, Freud was an exceptional thinker but 
a poor research scientist. He only ever had a 
small number of patients that he used to gener­
ate his ideas, and he never sought to measure 
their success systematically. There is even evi­
dence to suggest that the small number of his 
patients he did treat never improved, or even 
got worse, but Freud continued to push his the­
ories regardless. So, if someone assumes that 
you are learning how to perform Freudian anal­
ysis on them, feel free to tell them it’s mostly 
nonsense. Or tell them to call their mother.

 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
On the other hand, one can say that social psychology is one of the youngest 
sciences that there is. The sort of social understanding that our species has 
been doing for thousands of years is nothing like a proper science. It is not 
knowledge that has been built up from a systematic method of experimenta­
tion and hypothesis testing. Since its inception around 500 years ago, the 
scientific method has been applied to understanding every facet of the world 
around us. But it was long after we studied stars, planets, oceans, animals, 
cells, molecules and atoms that we turned the microscope upon ourselves 
and our own behaviour. In this sense, social psychology is indeed one of the 
youngest of the sciences.
Understanding What People Think 
and What Makes Them Act
If you are a zoologist and want to understand the social behaviour of ants, 
you are going to spend a long time on your knees with a magnifying glass, and 
you’re probably going to get bitten. Social psychologists have a luxury that 
zoologists do not: we can just ask people what they think and the reasons for 
their behaviour. We can directly measure people’s attitudes. And we rarely 
get bitten.
As I show you in Part II, social psychologists have developed many sophisti­
cated tools to measure, survey and record people’s attitudes towards a whole 
range of things: people of other races, prayer, ice cream flavours and taxa­
tion. But they quickly discovered a big problem. What people say about their 
attitudes doesn’t always – in fact rarely does – tell you what they are actually 
going to do at all. So the zoologists may have the last laugh after all.
Asking people what they think
Do you think that our society should spend more money helping people who 
are poor? That seems like a pretty straightforward question. I imagine that 
you have some opinions and could give me a one-word answer or an hour-
long argument. In both cases, you would be reporting what social psycholo­
gists call your explicit attitude: the opinions and beliefs that you can state 
out loud.
But here’s the problem. In Chapter 4, I show you the remarkable number of 
factors that can change the answer you give to that question. Were you asked 
by an attractive young person? Did they introduce themselves as being from 
www.it-ebooks.info

12
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
a homeless charity or the TaxPayers’ Alliance? Before asking the question, 
did they talk to you about your latest tax return, or about a time that you 
yourself felt the effects of poverty? What were the exact words they used – 
did they say spending more money on ‘poor people’ or on ‘the welfare state’?
Social psychologists have found time and time again that they can easily 
influence the explicit attitudes that people report. People may say they have 
one attitude, but then behave in a completely opposite manner. This leads 
to a number of practical and scientific questions: how do you measure what 
people really think? Do they even have lasting, stable attitudes that cause 
them to behave one way or another?
Measuring what people really think
Social psychologists now have the scientific tools to look under the surface 
of your everyday attitudes. If I ask you, ‘Do you think that men and women 
are equally capable in the workplace’ you would probably say yes. In other 
words, your explicit attitude would be that men and women are equal.
But imagine that I flashed up a picture of a person and you had to press 
one button to identify them as male, and another as female. I would predict 
that you would be very slightly slower to press the female button if she was 
shown wearing a business suit or a fire-fighters outfit than if she was shown 
in the home or the kitchen. The difference in your button press may be 
imperceptible to you, a matter of a few milliseconds, but social psychologists 
have computers that can measure and add up such differences.
Even though most people report explicit attitudes that treat people the same 
regardless of sex, race or nationality, in experiments like this their millisec­
ond reactions to words or pictures are different depending on if they refer to 
men or women, Black faces or White faces, and Christian names or Muslim 
names. These differences are called implicit attitudes. In Chapter 5, I show you 
how they are measured and how they can be used to predict people’s behav­
iour. I address the sometimes uncomfortable question: do these implicit atti­
tudes reflect what people really think?
Predicting people’s behaviour
When was the last time someone asked you, ‘Why did you do that?’ Perhaps 
it was after you pointedly ignored a friend, were unexpectedly kind to a 
stranger or punched a sibling. The person asking you wanted to know about 
your attitudes, I imagine, because they assumed that your behaviour was 
www.it-ebooks.info

13
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
caused by your attitudes. You were angry with the friend, you were attracted 
to the stranger or mildly irritated with the sibling. This seems like a reason­
able, common-sense assumption, but social psychology has discovered 
remarkable evidence that the assumption has things completely the wrong 
way round. Often, our behaviours cause our attitudes.
In Chapter 6 you will meet cognitive dissonance, one of the most powerful, 
elegant, and counter-intuitive theories in social psychology. Do you think that 
you’d be happier with this book if you got it at half the price? If your partner 
treats you poorly, do you think you’d love them more or less? These seem 
like obvious questions, but cognitive dissonance makes a series of remark­
able predictions that are borne out by careful experimentation.
Who Am I, Who Are You and 
Why Did They Do That?
Like a collector looking at a butterfly pinned to a board, so far we’ve focused 
on the individual outside of its natural habitat. We’ve explored the attitudes 
and beliefs that exist inside individuals’ heads, and how this might determine 
their behaviour. But people, like butterflies, live in a social context in which 
they interact with each other and the world around them. In Part III of the 
book I start to explore how people generate beliefs about themselves and the 
people around them, and how they understand each other’s social behaviour.
As you may have guessed, the opinions people have about others are not 
always completely fair, objective and rational. In this part of the book we 
explore how you make judgments about other people, and how stereotypes 
and prejudice can build up about certain groups and types of people. But 
first, there is one person who is on the receiving end of more of your preju­
dice and biased thinking than any other: yourself.
Constructing your sense of self
My favourite recurring scene in the science fiction show Dr Who is when he 
regenerates from an old body to the new. The new actor playing the Doctor 
would leap up from behind the console of the TARDIS, stare wildly at his 
hands and run to a mirror. He would then try and figure out who he was, what 
he was like and whether he liked his new taste in clothes.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Though you aren’t a Time Lord (probably) you too have to go through a pro­
cess of self-discovery and identity formation. This takes more than the five 
minutes that the Doctor has before the Daleks attack again. In Chapter 7, I 
explore this process. It begins in childhood, takes a left turn in adolescence 
and continues into adulthood. You are not just figuring out who you are, but 
also, importantly, how you fit into the social world. The conclusion that most 
of us reach during this process is that, actually, I’m a pretty good person.
Loving yourself
You are awesome. You are better than average at most things, you are more 
moral, more correct in your opinions and you make the right choices. At 
least, that is what you tend to believe. The problem is, that’s what everyone 
else believes too. And though everyone can’t all be better than average, that 
is what, on average, everyone believes.
No matter how self-deprecating or modest you may seem on the surface, 
you maintain a pretty good opinion of yourself. In Chapter 8, I look at the 
evidence that you, like everyone else, have a robust set of self-serving biases. 
You tend to believe that your successes are due to your personal qualities, 
but your failures are due to your bad luck. Whereas other people have preju­
dices and subjective opinions, your own views are more like objective facts.
Although you may think I’m making you out to be a horrible egotist, you are 
perfectly normal and healthy. Indeed, these self-serving biases appear to be 
a vital part of your psychological ‘immune system’ that, more or less, keeps 
you happy and sane no matter what you experience.
Explaining the actions of others
We don’t spend our entire lives thinking about ourselves, however. Pick up 
a gossip magazine, turn on the TV or eavesdrop on a conversation and the 
chances are you’ll hear people trying to figure out other people. Why did 
your boss snub you in the hallway? Why did one blond, beautiful celebrity 
dump another beautiful blond celebrity? Why did the waitress give you that 
funny look?
If you have the misfortune not to have read this book already – and probably 
even if you have – then you are likely to reach systematically incorrect expla­
nations for the behaviour of other people. As I demonstrate in Chapter 9, in 
www.it-ebooks.info

15
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
everyday life, you, like everyone else, tend to explain other people’s behav­
iour in terms of their personalities. The boss who snubbed you is rude, the 
celebrity is in love, and the waitress is a snob.
You tend to leap to these conclusions about personality and overlook expla­
nations in terms of the situation. You don’t consider that the boss was just 
thinking about something else, that the waitress thought she recognised you, 
and that the blond celebrity has a film coming out and her PR team just need 
her to be in the magazines. Later, in Part IV of this book, I try and convince 
you just how powerful these situational factors are in determining behaviour. 
But in Chapter 9, I explain how this bias towards personality explanations – 
called the fundamental attribution error – dominates your thinking about 
other people.
Judging and labelling others
The detective Sherlock Holmes was famous for his ability to deduce remark­
able things from people at only a glance. He would infer that a visitor to 221b 
Baker Street, for example, was a schoolmaster from the countryside who 
suspected his wife of having an affair from the mud on his shoes, a dusting of 
chalk on his sleeve and the lack of starch in his collar, suggesting a Victorian 
wife that no longer cared for him.
You may not have the eye for detail and the deductive powers of Sherlock 
Holmes, but that doesn’t stop you leaping to generalisations and unfounded 
conclusions whenever you meet other people.
You are hardwired to categorise and label other people. I explain in Chapter 10 
how this process of impression formation, judgment making, and generalisa­
tion can be a very useful way to understand and predict the people around 
you. But it can also easily lead to bias and prejudice, as you make conclusions 
based on your own assumptions rather than the people you see in front of 
you. I examine how this process of stereotyping occurs and how it can be 
avoided.
Measuring the Power of Social Forces
You may think of yourself as an independent person who stands up for their 
own opinions, even if you are a bit headstrong sometimes. No matter how 
independent you think you are, I would bet that much of your life and your 
decisions are under the thumb of social forces.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Walk out onto the street or into a room filled with people about your own age. 
Are they wearing the same sorts of clothes as you, some of the same labels? 
Look on your music player or your bookshelf – how many of those authors 
or musicians did you discover entirely yourself, and how many have your 
friends heard and read? In fact, I might argue that even your very conception 
of yourself as an independent, unique person is something that you have 
picked up from those around you, or that it’s an idea that has been marketed 
to you by the fashion industry so that (ironically) they can sell unique you 
the same clothes that everyone else is buying.
I explore in Part IV of this book all the ways that the world and the people 
around you can influence your actions, from the way that your job changes who 
you are, to why you obey your boss or your teachers. I explore the reasons why 
you feel an urge to mimic and follow your friends and peers, and why sales­
people and advertisers have such an easy time persuading you to buy things.
Controlled by the situation
Have you ever had to wear a uniform? The white and black of a waiter, the 
fatigues of a soldier, or just the same business outfit that everyone else wears 
at the office. Does wearing that uniform change who you are and how you act?
I tell you the story of one of the most famous studies in social psychology, 
the Stanford prison experiment, in Chapter 11. It was a stark demonstration 
that as much as your attitudes, beliefs and intentions, the situation that you 
are placed in – the restaurant, the army unit or the office – can determine 
your behaviour. In the case of the Stanford prison experiment, a group of 
regular, happy young men turned into broken, spiritless prisoners or oppres­
sive, sadistic guards, depending on which identity they were assigned by the 
researcher. The experiment’s conclusions reverberate through society today.
Obeying authority
Mr Tanner was the name of the worst teacher at my school. He had a boil on 
his neck like a half-buried snooker ball and a sadistic streak as thick and ugly 
as his ginger wig. He taught PE, mostly by yelling. Once he told a boy to run 
over to the side of the field, and the poor boy ran straight through a thorn 
bush rather than go round it so he didn’t get shouted at.
We obeyed Mr Tanner out of terror. But most obedience in our society does 
not come from fear. Rationally we know that the consequences of disobedi­
ence are small. It would be easy to violate parking laws or tax regulations, 
www.it-ebooks.info

17
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
or to shoplift and get away with it. But the moment someone in authority – a 
policeman, a teacher or even a scientist – asks us to do something, we are 
compelled by a force to obey.
I explore the power of authority in Chapter 12. You, like many people, may 
feel that obedience to authority is something that other people do, conjur­
ing up images of jackbooted Nazis saluting their leaders. Our culture, you 
would think, prizes rebels and challenges authority. But some very compel­
ling experiments proved that you don’t need threats and fear of Mr Tanner 
to make people obey. You just need a white coat, a calm voice and authority, 
and you can make nice people commit the most evil acts.
Being one of the crowd
Being a sheep is not much fun. You exist to be shaved or slaughtered, and 
all for the benefit of people who use your name as an insult. Who would be a 
sheep? Well, it may not be much of a consolation, but those people wearing 
jumpers, eating lamb and taking the name of sheep in vain – they are sheep 
too. For as much as people need warmth from wool and nourishment from 
meat, they have a basic human need to belong with others, to act and feel the 
same, too.
I explore the urge to conform in Chapter 13. Sometimes we follow the actions 
of others because we are clueless. The first time you got on a bus or paid at 
a self-service checkout, you probably looked at the person in front of you to 
see how it was done. More often, though, we follow the actions of others just 
because it feels right. Or perhaps, as I shall discuss, because not following 
others, being left out of the group, feels so bad. The only thing worse than 
being a sheep, is a lonely sheep.
Persuading and convincing
Perhaps you are flicking through this book in the shop, deciding whether to 
buy it. Or perhaps, given my comments on obedience, whether to steal it. Let 
me say a few things.
Firstly, you clearly have a good eye for books. You appreciate a quality, well-
written book. If you are thinking about buying this book – and it’s entirely 
your choice, of course – then you may want to do it sooner rather than later. 
It’s already sold out in many markets, as many, many students and interested 
readers have already bought copies. In fact, since this copy is half price, you 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
may need to act fast. But I tell you what – don’t decide to buy it now. Finish 
reading a couple more pages of this chapter first, and then make your deci­
sion. Would that be okay? After all, I did write it just for you!
I reveal the Jedi mind tricks that I (or advertisers before me) employed to 
compel you to buy this book in Chapter 14. I explain the techniques of label­
ling, low-balls, foot-in-the-door, reciprocity and others. You can use these 
mind powers yourself, or armed with the knowledge, resist persuasion 
attempts upon you. But you have to buy the book.
Living the Social Life
I’ve shown you how the attitudes inside your head relate to the actions you 
take, how these lead to thoughts about the people around you, and how 
those people can influence and determine your actions. In Part V, the final 
part of the book, I discuss how all those ideas and forces come together 
when you interact with other people, generating friendships and families, in 
groups and out-groups, and cultures and conflicts.
Liking, loving and respecting
The groups of people that define your life – friends, families and colleagues – 
are bound together by social forces. Some of these people you like. Some of 
them you love. And there are a few whose authority you respect. Thankfully, 
for people who have to write soap operas at any rate, you don’t always respect 
the ones you love, like the ones you respect or even like the ones you love.
I map out these competing and intertwining forces in Chapter 15. If you’ve 
ever wanted to know why some people are attractive and some not, why you 
fall in love with one type of person and not another, or what happens to you 
if you gain power and money, this is a good place to start.
Thinking and deciding
The man who designed the Mini did not have a high opinion of camels: ‘A 
camel is a horse designed by committee,’ he said sniffily. Though I think he 
is a little unfair on the camel, he makes a good point about the problems 
with group decision-making. No matter how smart the individual people in a 
group may be, together in a committee they are capable of spectacularly bad 
decisions.
www.it-ebooks.info

19
 Chapter 1: Introducing the Science of Social Psychology
I explain the dangers and failures of group think in Chapter 16. One particu­
larly disastrous meeting in the 1960s between President Kennedy and his top 
advisors led to a series of decisions that came frighteningly close to starting 
a nuclear war. Following this, social psychologists saw the urgency in study­
ing exactly why and what goes wrong when people gather together to make 
decisions.
Despite these pitfalls, we are remarkably successful social creatures, how­
ever. When he was able to avoid nuclear war, the same president inspired a 
nation to co-operate on a vast scale and send men to the moon with a tenth 
of the technology that is in your mobile phone. In the rest of the chapter I 
explore when and how people do co-operate and help each other.
Living in different cultures
And so, in Chapter 17, our social psychologists microscope pulls back to the 
widest field of view – a culture. As I show you, there are many differences 
in how people across the world think of themselves, their society and their 
place within it. These are not just abstract, theoretical differences in philo­
sophical outlook. They translate to measurable shifts in behaviour, differ­
ences in how people literally move their eyes across a scene, interpret what 
they see and remember their world.
The discovery of widespread cultural differences also leads me to re-examine 
a scientific assumption that has supported many of the experiments than 
run throughout this book: that people are pretty much the same the world 
over, and so it is justifiable to perform experiments on (mostly) rich white 
American psychology students, and assume that our conclusions hold for the 
rest of the world’s population. That is an assumption that social psycholo­
gists have lazily made for many years, and we are only just figuring out its 
consequences.
Looking Back Up the Microscope
I began this chapter by asking you to imagine a giant microscope zooming 
in on the subject of its science. But in one crucial way, a social psychologist 
looking down a microscope is very different from a biologist looking down 
a microscope. Don’t forget while you’re reading about all these theories and 
experiments that when you are looking down the social psychology micro­
scope you are not just peering at organisms, or people, you are looking at 
yourself, too.

W

hen you think of a scientist, you probably think of a single person: 
A lone genius, working in a laboratory full of bubbling test tubes 
or scrawling illegibly on a blackboard. But modern science is really a team 
effort. Social psychologists, like all scientists, work with many other people, 
sharing ideas and methods and data. They also collaborate with colleagues 
in very different disciples, from neuroscience to sociology to evolutionary 
biology. So rather than solitary geniuses, perhaps you should think of social 
scientists more like a team of superheroes, each with their own specialty 
and superpower (although now I’m picturing many of my colleagues wearing 
Lycra jumpsuits . . .).
In this chapter, I introduce you to the many specialties and disciplines that 
make up modern social psychology. I discuss the disciplines of personality 
and cognitive psychology, sociology and ethnography, and the exciting new 
research in social neuroscience that’s invigorating the science with a new 
source of data. I reveal how ideas from evolutionary biology are being used to 
understand puzzling findings and generate novel hypotheses.
But what is a team of social science superheroes without a mission? In this 
chapter I show you how the different disciplines of social psychology can 
bring their insights and expertise to tackle one question in particular. Of 
course, science can investigate all sorts of issues, but in this chapter I inves­
tigate why homicide rates are so high among males in the southern United

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
this question shows that social questions can be approached from many dif­
ferent angles and demonstrates how the various disciplines of social psychol­
ogy can be used to test ideas using a range of ingenious methods.
Looking at the Disciplines that 
Comprise Social Psychology
In this section I provide an overview of social psychology as it’s practised in 
the real world today. The advantage of being a relatively young discipline is 
that social psychology is open to new perspectives. It has rapidly incorporated 
findings in personality and cognitive psychology, and it eagerly applies the 
tools of modern neuroscience and biology to understand social phenomena.
Surveying the surveys of 
personality psychology
Personality psychology is sometimes called the psychology of individual dif­
ferences. Its goal is to measure and quantify the ways in which we differ 
from one another. Personality is a familiar term in everyday talk. In psychol­
ogy, your personality is the pattern of behaviour, beliefs and emotions that 
makes you different from other people. Your personality is something that 
is stable over time and across different situations. In other words, if you are 
very angry one day because of an unfair parking ticket, we wouldn’t term that 
as part of your personality, because it would be limited to that day and that 
experience.
The principle tools of personality psychology are questionnaires and surveys. 
Researchers ask participants to answer a large number of questions about 
their behaviour, habits, likes and dislikes. Then the researchers perform 
statistical analyses on the answers (called factor analysis) to see if there are 
consistent patterns. For example, a researcher may find that if people said 
that they had a large number of friends, then they also said that they enjoyed 
parties and that they didn’t like being alone. A different group of people may 
answer consistently in the opposite manner that they have fewer friends, 
don’t like parties and enjoy being by themselves. Statistics can identify these 
patterns, and then classify people along a scale. In this case, researchers 
have named the scale introversion-extraversion. If researchers know where 
someone is on that scale – the extraversion score – then they can predict how 
the person will answer all those questions, and also predict how she might 
behave across a large number of situations.

Personality psychologists debate the exact number, but it looks like about 
five different scales are needed to capture the main differences that we see 
between people. These are called the Big Five personality traits. They are 
openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism 
(often remembered by the acronym OCEAN). The claim is that most of the dif­
ferences between people can be expressed by those five traits. In other words, 
if we know where you lie along those scales, we know most of what there is to 
know about your personality.
The interaction between personality and social psychology is interesting. In 
a sense, they are at odds with one another. Personality psychology asks how 
the characteristics of different individuals determine their behaviour, regard­
less of the situations they happen to be in. Social psychology asks how differ­
ent social situations can determine behaviour, regardless of the differences 
that exist between people.
This is a useful tension between the two fields. For example, following the 
Second World War, people wanted to understand how regular German people 
could have supported what the Nazis did. A personality hypothesis was that 
German people were more responsive to authority, and so more likely to 
obey orders. In contrast, Stanley Milgram hypothesised that there was no 
difference between German and American people, for example, and that both 
might act to obey horrific orders if the situation compelled them to do so. 
We’ll see how he tested this hypothesis in Chapter 12.
Entering the laboratory of 
cognitive psychology
Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes and functions. Cognitive 
psychologists investigate what things people remember and what things they 
forget; how we can focus our attention on some things in the world and ignore 
others; how we learn and use language; and how all of these allow us to take 
action and make decisions.
You can read about the rich interaction between social and cognitive psychol­
ogy in Chapter 4. In many chapters throughout this book you see how a social 
process can be broken down into a series of cognitive processes. For example, 
imagine deciding whether to trust someone you have just met. This is a social 
judgment, and may be influenced by social representations such as stereo­
types. But it is determined by cognitive processes such as how you perceive 
the person you’ve met, how you allocate your visual attention to them, what 
memory representations you activate of other people, how you apply this past 
knowledge to categorising this person, and how you weigh that information 
when making your decisions.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
I don’t want you to think that social psychology is basically cognitive psy­
chology that happens to be applied to social things. To be honest, I used to 
be a cognitive psychologist myself and held pretty much that opinion. But 
some experimental findings changed my mind and emphasised the impor­
tance of social forces.
For example, consider the sort of simple choice reaction-time experiments 
that Donders studied a hundred years ago (see the nearby sidebar ‘Using ta 
stopwatch to understand the mind’). In the past few years, Natalie Sebanz 
and Guenther Knoblich have found that if two people performing such a task 
sit next to each other, then they are immediately influenced by each other’s 
Using a stopwatch to understand the mind
To understand these cognitive processes, psy­
chologists use reaction-time studies. They’re 
still the most used tool in a cognitive labora­
tory, and increasingly, in social psychology 
too. The logic behind reaction-time studies is 
quite elegant. It was first used in the laboratory 
by a Dutch ophthalmologist called Franciscus 
Donders at the end of the nineteenth century, 
though. As you recall, psychological science is 
all about turning mental concepts into things you 
can count, and Donders figured out a way to do 
this using what he called mental chronometry.
Donders gave his participants a very simple 
task called a choice reaction-time experiment. 
A light flashed on a screen and they had to 
press one button if it was green and a differ­
ent one if it was red. Nowadays we’d measure 
your reaction time in this task with computers, 
but Donders had wonderful brass clockwork 
devices for his measurements. The participants 
did this task many times, and worked out how 
long on average it took participants to identify 
the colour. Donders realised that this reaction 
time includes many things: the time it takes for 
the eyes to process the signal, for the brain to 
process the colour, for the participant to make 
a decision, for the brain to send a signal to the 
hand and for the muscles to twitch. But Donders 
was only interested in one element of this – the 
decision time.
His clever solution was to give his participants a 
second task. In this simple reaction-time study, 
the light was just one colour and the subjects 
pressed one button. In both experiments, the 
participants had to perceive a picture and 
make a button press, but only in the first one did 
they also have to make a choice. So Donders 
subtracted the time for the second, simple 
reaction-time experiment from the first, choice 
reaction-time experiment. The difference 
between these two corresponds to the deci­
sion time alone. With this simple but magical 
method, Donders measured mental functions, 
and began scientific psychology.
This method continues to be used in cognitive 
and social psychology today. The basic logic 
remains that differences in reaction time cor­
respond to differences in mental processing. 
In Chapter 5 you will see examples of reaction 
times being used to probe the implicit attitudes 
that people won’t admit to out loud.

tasks and instructions. In other words, when you add in another person to 
the experiment, even the first and simplest experiments in cognitive psychol­
ogy show that social influences have an immediate and powerful effect.
Playing with the gadgets of neuroscience
Neuroscience is the study of the brain. If cognitive psychologists are inter­
ested in the software of the mind, then neuroscientists are interested in the 
hardware: the blood and the guts and the biological mechanisms that allow 
you to think. They study the anatomy and structure of the brain and how it 
works in action. They want to know where language is processed in the brain, 
what happens to the visual information sent from the eyes and where memo­
ries are formed, stored and lost.
Previously, our knowledge came mostly from picking through the brains of 
patients who had died or inserting probes into the brains of animals and mea­
suring the behaviour of individual neurons. But now we have various tech­
nologies that allow us to record brain activity in the whole brain of an awake, 
living person.
The past 30 years have seen this technology make its way into the hands of 
social scientists, who often refer to themselves as social neuroscientists. Their 
brain imaging technique that you will read most about is fMRI, which stands 
for functional magnetic resonance imagining. It is much like the MRI machine in 
hospitals (or every episode of House). The patient lies on a table and is slowly 
moved into a small white tunnel or ring. This scanner produces a strong mag­
netic field that interacts with various atoms in the body in different ways. By 
measuring this interaction, the scanner can build up a three-dimensional image 
of the insides of the body, distinguishing bone and different types of soft tissue. 
Check out the sidebar ‘Looking inside the brain’ for details.
Techniques such as fMRI give indirect measures of brain activity while a 
participant is watching a computer screen and making simple hand actions. 
Other techniques, such as ERP recordings, measure brain activity from scalp 
electrodes, and diffusion tensor imaging can map the connections between 
brain areas. These techniques all differ in exactly what they tell you about 
the brain, how accurate they are about the timing of events and the size of 
the regions that they can discriminate.
Using these techniques to study social interaction directly is very hard. But 
using clever experimental designs, researchers can get around these limita­
tions. For example, Chris Frith and colleagues placed their participants in 
an fMRI scanner and asked them to play the children’s game paper-scissors-
stone. On the count of three they made their hand shapes, and then saw on 
screen what their opponents had chosen and who had won.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Here’s the clever bit of the experiment: they were told that either their oppo­
nent was another participant in the experiment or that they were playing 
against a computer choosing at random. So in both of these conditions, the 
participant has to choose a hand shape, follow a strategy and try and win. 
But in the case where they think that they are playing against a real person, 
they are also predicting the behaviour of another person: they were doing 
social cognition. If we look at the differences between brain activation in 
Looking inside the brain
An MRI scanner can do more than take pho­
tographs like an X-ray machine. It can look at 
changes that take place over time. When used 
on the brain, an MRI scanner is able to detect 
changes in blood flow (blood-oxygen-level 
dependent or BOLD contrast). Neurons in the 
brain require energy that they get from blood, 
so blood flow is an indirect way for us to mea­
sure neuronal activity.
The f bit of fMRI refers to the function that the 
brain is carrying out. So while participants are 
in the scanner, researchers can show pictures 
of faces, for example. The changes in blood 
flow that occur while they look at those images 
can tell us what parts of the brain have the 
function of understanding faces.
Well, not quite. Remember that the fMRI is look­
ing at the activity of the whole brain. And while 
the participants are in the scanner, they are 
doing more than just looking at faces. They are 
also processing patches of two-dimensional 
colour, remembering the images, thinking about 
the instructions the researcher told them, feel­
ing bored, trying not to move too much, hoping 
that the experiment will be over soon, and plan­
ning what to have for dinner that night. All of 
these thoughts are mental activity that is hap­
pening in the brain and changing the flow of 
blood.
To figure out which bits of brain activity corre­
spond to which bits of mental function, research­
ers can use a form of the technique that Donders 
invented a hundred years ago: subtraction. For 
example, researchers interested in emotion 
perception will show the participants pictures 
of happy faces, but also show them something 
else, like pictures of neutral faces with no 
expression. They then subtract the brain activ­
ity during the happy face viewing from the brain 
activity during neutral face viewing. What’s left 
over, the researchers hope, is the brain activity 
that is specifically related to looking at emotion, 
not looking at images in general, or faces in 
general, or being in the scanner in general. With 
this technique, researchers can try and localise 
mental function to precise regions of the brain.
The key to doing a good social neuroscience 
experiment is choosing the right control condi­
tion. And particularly in social psychology, that 
can be a tricky decision. In the example here, 
the control condition was a neutral face with 
no expression. But does such a thing exist? Isn’t 
a face with ‘no expression’ a face that actually 
looks sort of bored and resentful? In social neu­
roscience it’s vital to understand exactly how 
stimuli are seen and interpreted by the people 
in the scanner if we want to understand exactly 
what their brains are doing.

27
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
these two cases, subtracting one from the other, we are left with the brain 
activation that specifically corresponds to thinking about another person’s 
behaviour.
Understanding where in the brain something happens can give us valuable 
insights that we cannot always discover by looking at behaviour alone. For 
example, when some participants look at particular faces, researchers have 
found activation in the amygdala. The exact function of this brain area is 
hotly debated, but it seems to be related to uncertainty and fear. And this 
activation is highest when one group, such as White Americans, look at the 
faces of an out-group, like Black Americans.
In another application of neuroscience to social psychology, researchers 
asked participants to consider moral and political questions, like should gay 
couples be allowed to adopt. In some participants, considering these ques­
tions activated brain areas relating to disgust, but in others it did not. If we 
just look at their behaviour, we would only know the outcome of the decision, 
but neuroscience can help reveal the thoughts and motivations that pro­
duced it.
Engaging with sociology
Sociology is the study of human social behaviour, societal structures and 
interpersonal interactions. In many ways then, it seems very similar to social 
psychology. There is certainly a lot of overlap between the disciplines. The 
key difference is in the scale of analysis. Sociologists tend to focus on groups 
of people, such as the upper middle class, elderly people, Catholics or unem­
ployed teenagers. They survey and study these groups of people and then try 
to understand how they interact with each other. Social psychologists always 
Science fiction and science fact
There are many extravagant claims made 
about neuroscience. Several companies are 
marketing fMRI machines that detect if some­
one is lying, they say. There have been claims 
that brain imaging could detect if a prisoner 
was likely to commit a crime again. Following 
September 11, several companies were mar­
keting fMRI machines that could be placed 
in airports to identify terrorists. There is no 
indication right now that brain imaging can (or 
should) carry out any of these functions, and 
good reasons to think that they never could. 
Indeed, some neuroscientists argue that many 
of the basic assumptions we’ve been making 
about brain imaging need to be re-thought. 
All of this makes modern neuroscience a very 
exciting field, but a healthy dose of scepticism 
is often required.

focus on the individual, however. Since all groups of people are made up of 
individuals, there is a useful and productive interaction between sociologists 
and social psychologists.
For example, a few years ago in London there were riots throughout the city. 
I could hear them from my front room, in fact. Afterwards, a large team of 
sociologists tried to understand why they took place by interviewing the 
people involved. In part the riots were a reaction against the police who, 
days before, had shot an unarmed man who they thought was carrying a gun. 
Another issue was the tension between an increasingly materialistic culture 
that values owning the latest gadget and most expensive shoes, and the rela­
tive poverty and unemployment of large numbers of young people in the 
capital. Another motivation was simply boredom and the thrill of adventure.
While sociologists were able to identify these recurring themes amongst 
groups and subgroups of rioters, social psychologists can investigate how 
they play out in the minds of individuals. They can run experiments on 
people to see if violence is intrinsically rewarding, and for whom. They can 
investigate if people see police officers as part of their community or as an 
out-group to be mistrusted, and what factors produce this ‘them and us’ 
thinking. And lastly, they can look at the decision-making of the police offi­
cers themselves. What might have caused them to jump to the conclusion 
that their suspect was armed, since none of them had directly seen a gun?
Tracing the ideas of evolutionary biology
Evolutionary biology is the study of how organisms change over time as they 
adapt to their environment. Human beings are the outcome of millions of 
years of evolution. And, like ants, chimps and marmosets, a central part of 
your evolutionary story is how human beings adapted to live and co-operate 
with each other. When a social psychologists asks a question such as ‘why do 
we mistrust strangers?’ or ‘why do we feel jealousy?’, an evolutionary biolo­
gist might answer that people evolved to be that way. Evolutionary psycholo­
gists seek answers to your everyday behaviour in your evolutionary past.
Evolutionary psychology has a puzzling aspect though. The world you live in 
today is not the world in which your ancestors evolved. In many ways, you 
are just like the kakapo parrot – not really suited to the world you inhabit 
(see the sidebar ‘What do the world’s fattest parrot and your brain have in 
common?’).

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
The defining characteristics of the human species – farming, cities, writing – 
appeared only 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. This is remarkably recent in the scale 
of biological history. Some of the most pervasive features of our lives today – 
use of machines, electricity, computers – happened relatively mere moments 
ago, a couple of generations in some cases. Evolution doesn’t require hundreds 
What do the world’s fattest parrot and 
your brain have in common?
In New Zealand lives a parrot called the kakapo. 
It is fat and green and cannot fly. The male 
kakapo attracts a mate by building a bowl-like 
structure called a lek and making a loud bass 
rumble. This takes so much effort that it can only 
go through the mating process once every four 
years when one particular tree bears an energy-
rich fruit that drops to the ground. Females find 
the bass sound hard to localise, and often never 
find a male. If two are able to breed, parenthood 
is often unrewarding. The kakapo builds a nest 
on the ground, which is easily raided by rats and 
ferrets. The rodents are able to find the kakapo 
because it emits a strong odour that is not unlike 
the smell of the inside of a violin case. The par­
rot’s means of defence is to flatten itself on the 
ground and stay very still indeed. This rarely 
troubles the rodents. They eat many of the eggs 
that are produced every four years.
It won’t surprise you to hear that the kakapo is 
on the verge of extinction. Thankfully, they still 
survive today thanks to a concerted effort by a 
large team of conservationists. But why does 
the kakapo exist at all? Whether you believe 
in evolution or intelligent design, the kakapo 
seems a spectacularly poor example of both.
The answer to this puzzle lies in the first thing 
that I told you about this bird. It lives in New 
Zealand. The islands had been geographically 
isolated for millions of years, producing unique 
biodiversity with very few mammals and many 
unique bird species. Then, with the arrival of the 
Maori in the thirteenth century and Europeans 
in the eighteenth century, rats, ferrets and other 
small land predators were introduced. For thou­
sands of years, the kakapo’s only threat had 
come from eagles. These predators hunted 
from above and were unable to see the green 
kakapo if they flattened themselves on the floor 
and stayed very still. Until human beings began 
denuding the islands of trees, the fruit-bearing 
plant that the kakapo favoured was common 
and bore fruit regularly. The large number of 
kakapo meant that a male and female would 
usually find each other, even if their calls were 
hard to place.
In short, the kakapo is a perfectly evolved crea­
ture for a specific environmental niche. It’s just 
that the niche no longer exists. It evolved for 
a world that it lives in no longer. The provoca­
tive proposal of evolutionary psychology is that 
we are kakapo too. Evolutionary psychologists 
have studied human thinking and social interac­
tion and claim that we have many biases and 
strange quirks. Like the kakapo, your brain is 
a productive of evolution that does not quite 
make sense in today’s world.

of generations to change a species; it can happen very fast. But many of the 
selection pressures that existed for hundreds of thousands of years, shaping 
our species, no longer exist for us today.
Some evolutionary psychologists claim that there are features of our cogni­
tion and behaviour that don’t make sense in the context of our lives today. 
But they do make sense when we consider the adaptive pressures that 
shaped the course of our evolution. We like symmetrical faces, we are poor 
at reasoning with probability and we make irrational decisions repeatedly. In 
this way, we are frozen in defence against now-redundant dangers. We make 
decisions that only make sense in the context of our evolutionary history.

If you are lucky enough to have known them both, think of your two grannies. 
Now answer this question: which one loves you the most? It’s a terrible thing 
to ask, and I’m sure you’d say at first that they both love you. But – if you had 
to pick one – which do you think loves you more?
When researchers asked this question, and whenever I ask it in lectures, the 
clear answer is always the same. One granny lived closer to them growing up, 
visited more times or gave better birthday presents. For the clear majority of 
people, this more loving granny was their mother’s mother. Why do you think 
this might be?
Evolutionary psychologists have offered one answer to this strangely reliable 
fact about grannies. There’s no easy way to break this to you, but it’s all to 
do with your mother’s infidelity. Or rather, the possibility of it. Your mother 
can be really quite certain that you are biologically related to her. Of course, 
there can be adoptions, egg donations, mistaken baby swaps at the hospital, 
but these cases apart, your mother can be sure that you are hers.
This is not true of your father, however. I don’t want to cast aspersions on 
your family, but it is logically possible that the man who was at your birth 
and signed your birth certificate was not the person who had conceived you 
nine months previously. This is just an unavoidable feature of the way we 
mammals reproduce.
So now consider the perspective of your grandmothers. Assume that they 
are hardwired to maximise the success of their genetic material. Assume 
that they have limited resources that they can use to ensure the success of 
their genes. Your mother’s mother is certain that half of her genes are in your 
mother, and that half of those are in you. Your father’s mother does not have 
this certainty. So, if your grandmothers follow Darwinian logic, your father’s 
mother is less likely to invest her resources in you. There’s the chance that 
you carry none of her genetic material, and that investment would be lost. 
Even though today we have DNA testing that can remove such uncertainty, 
the evolutionary perspective is that favouring a daughter’s daughter became 
hardwired in our species, and the behaviour persists today.

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
Of course, you may be able to think of alternative explanations why in gen­
eral a mother’s mother seems the more affectionate grandparent. But this 
example illustrates how evolutionary reasoning can be applied to human 
behaviour today.
Evolutionary psychologists try and identify these ancestral qualities of our 
behaviour and fit them into the framework of our long evolutionary past. 
Their ideas are often highly contentious to other psychologists. The chief 
criticism is that many of these theories are completely untestable. Since we 
cannot go back in time and observe or experiment on our ancestors, there 
is no way to falsify these ideas. We will come across these arguments many 
times during the course of this book.
Social Psychology in Action
By now you have an idea of the territory of modern social psychology and 
the disciplines that populate it. But remember that science is a tool for root­
ing out answers. So now let’s put all those ideas and methods to use!
In this section, I illustrate how the ideas and methods of social psychology 
can be applied to one particular issue: the violent culture of the White male 
in the southern United States. This section reports the work of Dov Cohen 
and Richard Nisbett, who thoroughly researched this question. Of course, 
in social psychology one could ask many questions, and take many routes 
to the answers. But this case serves as a great example of the process social 
psychologists use and the way they can utilise all the tools at their disposal 
to hunt down the answers to their question.
Asking the right questions
Understanding the causes of violence is of obvious practical value, so how 
can social psychology help?
Asking the question is the first step in understanding. And it’s the most 
important one. Asking the right question can unlock the phenomena you are 
trying to understand. Asking the wrong question can lead to fruitless years 
of frustration. Social psychology, like all science, follows a process of hypoth­
esis testing that – hopefully – drives our understanding forward.
Here’s a question to begin our enquiry: in the US, why is the homicide rate 
higher in the southern states than the northern states? If you rank all the 
states by the number of homicides per 100,000 of the population, the 2003 
www.it-ebooks.info

32
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
figures show that of the ten states at the bottom of that list, with the highest 
homicide rates, nine are in the South. Of the ten best states with the lowest 
homicide rates, none are in the South. Why does this difference exist?
At this point, a social scientist could put forward a number of hypotheses. A 
hypothesis is a guess, a possible explanation. A good hypothesis makes a clear 
statement about the causes of something, and so makes predictions about 
what will happen in the future. Scientists can then test these predictions with 
studies and experiments. If the predictions are wrong, then they can reject 
that hypothesis.
As I explore in Chapter 3, this is how scientists make progress, by rejecting 
possible hypotheses and narrowing down the ways that we can explain some­
thing. It sounds strange, but for this reason, a good hypothesis is one that 
we can clearly show is wrong. Indeed, having ideas that we can conclusively 
prove are wrong is the definition of scientific progress!
So let’s generate some hypotheses about why there are more homicides in 
the southern states of the US.
)>>
✓)>>The southern states are hotter, on average, and an increase in heat leads 
to an increase in violence.
)>>
✓)>>The southern states have more poverty than the northern ones, and 
poverty leads to crime.
)>>
✓)>>There are differences in gun laws in the South that mean that violence 
and crime are more likely to end in homicide.
All these hypotheses are plausible. Studies have shown, for example, that 
violent crime increases whenever the temperature gets hotter. And poverty 
is indeed correlated with crime rates. But these hypotheses can’t be the full 
story. There are hotter and poorer states outside of the South, for example, 
that don’t have the same homicide rates. Other states in the US and other 
countries, like Canada, have similar gun laws as the South, but they don’t 
have the high homicide rates.
Here’s another hypothesis:
There is a cultural difference between the North and the South which pro­
duces more male violence.
This is the hypothesis that I’m going to explore in more detail. It is at just the 
right level of analysis for social psychology, as it focuses on the individual 
and their cultural mindset. The hypothesis immediately generates many 
questions that can be explored: what is the nature of the cultural difference 
between the North and the South? Where did it come from? What function

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
does it serve? What are the psychological and behavioural differences that 
are produced by this cultural difference? You can use the many tools of social 
psychology to answer these questions.
Understanding the culture of cowboys
Anthropologists have described what they call a ‘culture of honour’ that 
exists in many places across the world. In these societies, what is most 
important is one’s honour, or reputation. If that reputation is threated, by an 
actual or perceived slight or insult, then a man (typically) has to do whatever 
he can to punish the perpetrator and restore his honour. Often this means 
resorting to violence. You can find cultures of honour across the world, and 
even in Klingon society.
The idea of a culture of honour seems to capture some of the stereotypes 
people have about southern males in the United States. When people think 
about a cowboy they often picture a stereotype of a cowboy fighting to pro­
tect his honour in a gunfight at high noon or a brawl in a bar. In each case, 
violence can start from a small insult and escalate into something fatal. It is 
also evident in how people in the South see themselves. The phrase ‘Don’t 
Mess with Texas’ began life as an anti-litter slogan placed along the Texas 
highways. But quickly, Texans seized upon it as a way to sum up their own 
attitude. Now you can find it printed on t-shirts, bumper stickers, holsters 
and even a nuclear submarine, in the crest of the USS Texas.
Finding the roots of the culture of honour
Sociology can play a vital role in framing questions for social psychology. As 
I discussed in the case of the London riots, sociologists were able to iden­
tify potential motives and beliefs in the minds of the rioters that generated 
hypotheses that social psychologists can test.
What can sociology tell us about the ‘culture of honour’, and how it ended 
up in the south of the US? The answer lies in the waves of immigration from 
Europe and the different types of immigrants.
)>>
✓)>>Farmers: One wave of immigration to America came from the south of 
England. These were the Pilgrims of American folklore, and were mostly 
farmers. They settled in what is now the north-east of America, and 
established farmlands.
)>>
✓)>>Herders: Another wave of immigration came from the north of England, 
Scotland and Ireland. These people were mostly herders. They moved 
into areas in the southern US and then pushed west across the country.
Why would these two different types of people develop different cultural 
practices?

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
When you own a field, you can feed a large number of people and stealing 
it is quite hard for someone. In other words, farming communities tend to 
be quite stable. They can provide food and wealth, but only with concerted 
effort over a long time. Successful farming communities can support a large 
number of people and are able to employ people to keep order in their societ­
ies. In the North, wealth doesn’t tend to change hands very quickly because 
it takes a long time to accumulate land and for it to yield a profit.
The southern herders had a very different society. When you own a herd of 
animals, you have to look after them constantly. Someone can steal them all 
overnight. In other words, herding communities can be quite volatile. Wealth 
can change hands overnight and does not gradually accumulate. Herding 
societies are also quite thinly populated. Animal herds take up a lot of space, 
and they don’t feed as many people as crops do. These sparsely populated, 
relatively poor societies couldn’t afford to employ policemen or people to 
protect their wealth. Even if they did, they couldn’t look after everyone’s 
herd at once.
Sociologists argue that the only thing stopping people stealing from each other 
in the herder societies of the South was the culture of honour. Without effec­
tive law enforcement, the only thing to deter thieves is the threat of retaliation 
from the person they have wronged. If you have a reputation as someone who 
is not to be crossed, who hits back twice as hard, then people will be dissuade 
from stealing from you. But if you are someone who is easily pushed around, 
who doesn’t stand up for themselves, then there is nothing to stop people 
stealing from you. In other words, your honour is the only protection that you 
have. So it makes sense that you have to defend your honour at all costs.
But we are talking about people hundreds of years ago, you might object. 
What evidence is there that these attitudes persist, let alone explain the 
homicide rate of the southern states today? Before we turn to psychology for 
an answer, we can make two more sociological observations:
)>>
✓)>>If you look at a map of the US coloured by those waves of immigration to 
the North and the South 200 years ago, it bears a striking similarity to the 
map of the votes for Republicans or Democrats in the last few elections. 
In other words, it seems possible that events from many generations ago 
still have some bearing on society today.
)>>
✓)>>We can peer a little more into those homicide statistics comparing the 
South and the North. Some homicides were carried out in the course of 
another crime. A robber shoots the bank clerk, for example. For these 
felony-related homicides, the South and the North are equal. There is no 
difference. But you can also count the non-felony-related homicides. In 
the South today, more than twice as many of these homicides exist that 
resulted from something like an argument in a bar.

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
So clearly, a difference between these two societies exists that needs explain­
ing. But how do we prove that the culture of honour persists to this day, and 
how does it influence the behaviour of modern-day cowboys?
Finding answers with social psychology
Sociology, history and anthropology can all serve social psychology by identi­
fying social phenomena. That’s not all though. I’ve seen many conference talks 
in social psychology that have begun with something a researcher has noticed 
in an episode of The Simpsons or another TV show. One talk, for example, 
explored an issue raised in Seinfeld – why doesn’t Elaine realise that she is a 
really bad dancer? This began an entire empirical project examining how part 
of people’s incompetence is not recognising what competence looks like.
The other social sciences, art and media are a vital source of inspiration for 
hypotheses in social psychology. But all they can do is help us identify and 
ask interesting questions. To find the answers, to test those hypotheses, we 
need the tools of social psychology.
In seeking answers about violence in the south of the US, we’ve drawn on 
sociology to inform our concept of the culture of honour and historical con­
text to give us an idea about the function of this behaviour. But so far, we 
have no direct psychological evidence. For example, the image of a ‘cowboy’ 
that I’ve described may not be an accurate description of what people are 
really like in the American South. Now I’ll show you how social psychology 
can test our hypotheses on Americans today.
Survey data
As a first step in social psychology, surveys are often employed. A large 
number of people are surveyed and asked specific questions that explore the 
researchers’ hypotheses. All that surveys can offer is correlational evidence, 
however. By that I mean that all they can show is that the answers people 
give to questions are connected in some way. As I will show, what we can con­
clude based on patterns of response in survey data is always limited.
The hypothesis being tested is that the culture of honour described by 
anthropologists and historians still exists today in the mind of the south­
ern American male. Turning that idea into something that can be counted, 
researchers construct a survey study. In this example, researchers sent 
surveys to people in the south and north of the US. They asked them some 
simple questions about how they might behave. For example, they asked, 
‘Would you approve if a man punched an adult male stranger if that stranger 
was a drunkard who bumped into the man and his wife?’ Significantly more

36
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
people from the southern states approved of that action. Similarly, they were 
asked whether it was okay for a 10-year-old boy to fight back when some­
one stole his lunch money. So this gives us some reasons to think that our 
hypothesis might be true.
However, might there be other explanations for this pattern of survey 
responses? Other surveys have found that the more likely someone is to be 
involved in crime, the more likely they are to have just eaten an ice cream, 
and the less likely they are to own a pet. Does this mean that to reduce 
crime we should ban ice creams and give everyone a puppy?
No, there are other explanations for these patterns of survey data. As I men­
tioned already, when it gets hotter outside, people are more likely to commit 
violent crimes, and so are also more likely to consume ice creams. Also, richer 
families are more likely to own a pet (as keeping one is very expensive), and 
richer people are less likely to have family members involved in crime. In 
these cases, the puppies and the ice cream aren’t directly related to crime, but 
are connected through the additional factors of the weather and wealth.
Other explanations may exist for our surveys of people in the North and the 
South too. Perhaps the South simply has more violent crime, and so people 
are more familiar with, and accepting of, violent behaviour. But it has nothing 
to do with the culture of honour. Not that we can prove with just a survey.
Field studies
In a field study, researchers observe something about behaviour as it natu­
rally occurs ‘in the wild’. They control some factors about the situation, so a 
field study is a bit like an experiment. But it is missing the key ingredient of 
random assignment – I’ll get to that in the next section.
In one famous field study Philip Zimbardo (we’ll meet him many times in this 
book) left a car parked by the side of the road with its hood up. In fact, he left 
two cars – one in Palo Alto, California and one in the Bronx, New York. Both 
were left within a block of famous universities, Stanford University and New 
York University respectively. The researchers then snuck across the road to 
observe what happened.
However, the researchers had barely set up their equipment in the Bronx 
before passers-by had helped themselves to the car battery, the contents of 
the glove compartment and the radiator. Forty-eight hours later, 23 acts of 
theft and vandalism had left the car on blocks, stripped and beaten.
The car in Palo Alto also drew the attention of the locals. After five days, a 
passer-by noticed that it was raining and lowered the hood to protect the car. 
Other than that helpful gesture, the car was untouched.

 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
This field study clearly reveals that there were different attitudes to property 
and crime in Palo Alto and New York. In New York at the time, vandalism and 
crime were commonplace and visible everywhere. Palo Alto, in contrast, is 
almost oppressively clean and well behaved. When I lived there, I always felt 
embarrassed going out without freshly pressed clothes and a manicure.
But what can you conclude beyond the fact that there are differences between 
the two communities? From a field study, not that much. The differences 
could have been to do with wealth, the weather, local attitudes, the likelihood 
of police taking action or even the relative value of the cars.
Field studies have similarly been used to illuminate the difference between 
cultures in the north and south of the US. Researchers carried out a field study 
by sending letters to car dealerships in the North and South. The letters were 
asking for a job interview, and appeared to be genuine. There were two types 
of letter. In one, the applicant explained that he was having a hard time getting 
an interview because, ‘I have been convicted of a felony, namely manslaughter.’
He goes on to explain that one night at a bar, a drunk boasted of sleeping with 
his fiancée, and then challenged him to a fight. Not wanting to back down, 
they went outside. The drunk jumped him from behind and, in defence, the 
man struck out with a pipe that he found on the ground, killing the man. As 
you can see, there are many details here that appeal to the culture of honour. 
The applicant was defending his reputation and his fiancée’s good name. He 
was attacked unfairly and struck back in defence.
The second letter began the same way, ‘I have been convicted of a felony’. 
But this time the crime was motor vehicle theft. The applicant explained that 
he’d been young and needed money to pay the bills, and so he’d decided to 
steal expensive cars. As you can see, this letter has commonalities with the 
first, but the crime is not connected to the culture of honour in anyway.
Would car dealerships in the North and South responds differently to these 
two job letters? The researchers operationalised these questions in two ways 
(that is, they took the initial concept and turned it into something they could 
measure).
)>>
✓)>>First operationalisation: They just counted the number of car dealer­
ships who responded with an application form and an invitation to 
apply. For the motor theft letter, there was no difference between the 
North and the South in their responses. For the manslaughter letter, 
however, southern car dealerships were more likely to reply with an 
application form.

)>>
✓)>>Second operationalisation: The researchers counted the number of pos­
itive words in the dealerships’ cover letters (we warmly encourage you 
to apply, many thanks for your letter, and so on). The northerners used 
more positive words in replying to the applicant who had confessed to 
stealing. For the southerners, however, they expressed equal or more 
warmth to the person who had killed a man than the person who had 
been convicted of theft.
This field study clearly shows that – in this sample of car dealers – there are 
different attitudes in the North and South towards crime that is committed in 
defence of one’s honour. But how far can we generalise this result? Are there 
other explanations? Perhaps it’s just the case that people in the South are 
more accustomed to cases of homicide because it’s more common; this famil­
iarity explains the difference with the North – it has nothing to do with a cul­
ture of honour, per se. To escape these circular arguments, we need stronger 
data, and so the researchers turned to laboratory experiments.
Experiments
Experiments are the most powerful tool that a social psychologist can use. A 
well-designed experiment, with clear and unambiguous data provides a solid 
building block of evidence. It may only be a small block, more like a Lego 
brick, but every well-designed experiment conclusively says something, and 
from these little blocks we build scientific knowledge.
Experiments are so important to social psychology that I’ve devoted the 
whole of Chapter 3 to explaining what makes a good one, what makes a bad 
one and how to design one yourself.
The key idea is that in an experiment, the researchers take control of the 
social situation – everything that the participants in the experiment see and 
hear. They create (at least two) different versions of an experiment that differ 
in one regard and one regard only. For example, in a simple experiment, par­
ticipants might interact with a researcher who asks them their political opin­
ions. The only different between two versions of the experiment is whether 
the researcher they interact with is male or female. The experimenter will 
then analyse some aspect of the participants’ behaviour that they have care­
fully measured. For example, they may quantify if the participant gave more 
left- or right-wing answers. If there is a systematic difference between partici­
pants who interacted with a man or woman we can conclude – cautiously – 
that the sex of an interviewer can change the political beliefs a participant will 
publicly espouse.
Chapter 3 has many more examples of the experimental method at work. For 
now, let’s see how they can help us test our hypotheses about the culture of 
honour. Researchers performed a series of experiments at a university in the 
www.it-ebooks.info

39
 Chapter 2: Exploring the Territory of Social Psychology
middle of the US state of Illinois. This campus is unusual in having a roughly 
equal number of male students from the more rural area to the south, and 
the more urban areas to the north. In other words, they have both southern 
and northern participants and can randomly assign them to experimental 
conditions.
I particularly like these experiments for the range of creative ways that the 
researchers operationalised their ideas. Questionnaires, chemical swabs 
and mechanical measuring devices were all used to quantify the culture of 
honour.
I’d like you to imagine being a participant in one of these experiments. Like 
all their participants, you’d be a White American male from either the North 
or the South. You turn up to the laboratory and someone in a lab coat asks 
you to give a saliva sample. Then you’re asked if you’d mind taking it to 
another lab down the corridor. You agree. On your way down the corridor 
you see a large, muscular guy. You think that he’s another person doing the 
experiment, but actually he’s acting out a role given to him by the research­
ers. In the insult condition he bumps into you, mutters ‘asshole’, then wan­
ders off. In the control condition he walks silently by. You then give a second 
sample at the next laboratory.
As you can see, the insult condition is a clear case of your honour being 
under threat. So how would you react? And how could we measure the 
responses of participants to compare the southerners and the northerners?
First of all, the researchers simply asked the participants who were insulted 
about the incident. Northerners were more likely to say that they were 
amused by the whole thing. Southerners reported more anger than amuse­
ment. They also asked participants whether they thought others who saw the 
incident would see them as less masculine as a consequence. Southerners 
felt that their masculinity would decrease in the eyes of others if they’d been 
insulted, but there were no differences between the North and South in the 
control condition. These answers clearly fit the pattern of the culture of 
honour for the South. But are these southerners really angry? Maybe they 
are just giving the answer that they feel is correct, given their upbringing, but 
they don’t really feel angry or less masculine.
Next, the researchers turned to more innovative operationalisations to 
explore this question. In one experiment, the participants had to walk back 
past the same muscular man who’d insulted them (or not) previously. The 
corridor was very narrow, especially given how wide the man was. Two 
people couldn’t pass shoulder to shoulder. Someone had to back down and 
stand aside to let the other person pass. The muscular man was told to stand 
his ground and not to back down at all. In this situation, what would the par­
ticipants do?
www.it-ebooks.info

40
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
The researchers watched the participants walk towards the large man and 
measured how close they got to him before deciding to stand to the side and 
let him pass. In the control condition, where no one had been insulted, the 
southern males stood aside at a large distance. In a sense, they were more 
polite and accommodating to the other person. But in the insult condition 
they got much closer to the man, less than half the distance away, before 
they backed down. The northerners showed a much smaller difference 
between the two conditions.
In another version of the experiment, the participants came into the labora­
tory after being insulted (or not) and shook the researcher’s hand. They were 
able to measure the strength of the participants’ grips during their hand­
shakes. Sure enough, if the southern subjects had just been insulted, they 
gave a much stronger handshake.
So here we have two aspects of behaviour – the strength of their handshakes 
and the distance between themselves and another male who won’t stand out 
of the way. The participants were probably barely aware of how they were 
acting in this regard. Yet nevertheless, the southern males showed more 
aggressive and assertive behaviour in exactly the conditions where their 
honour had been insulted.
Finally, the researchers actually looked at the chemicals in those saliva 
samples. Remember that they got two, before and after the insult incident, 
so that they could measure changes in cortisol and testosterone. They have 
a complex function in the body, but very simply these hormones appear to 
be related to stress and aggression. The northerners showed little difference, 
regardless of what happened to them in the corridor. But the southerners 
had a marked increase in these hormone levels if they had just been insulted.
The experimental data tell a remarkably consistent story. From reported feel­
ings of anger and masculinity, to subtle aspects of behaviour like handshakes 
and interpersonal distance, to the bodily production of behaviour-influencing 
hormones: southerners are affected when their honour is threatened. These 
are full experiments that use random assignments and have well-designed 
control conditions. So we know that it is not just that southerners always 
have firmer handshakes, or that everyone gets a testosterone spike when 
insulted. We can conclude that these changes occur specifically in southern­
ers specifically when they are insulted.
That power and precision is what experimental social psychology can deliver 
at its best. In Chapter 3 I explore how social psychologists design and analyse 
experiments in order to probe the processes and mechanisms that lie behind 
our social lives.

W

e use knowledge about other people every day. For example, when we 
guess why a parent seems angry today, when we predict how a friend 
will react to a surprise party or when we deduce why a person is running down 
the street. These beliefs are shaped by our experiences, stories, education, 
religious instruction and watching soap operas. But often, this everyday knowl­
edge is quite different to scientific social psychology. In fact, I show you in this 
chapter that often, everyday ‘common sense’ is social psychology’s greatest 
enemy.
How do social psychologists prove their claims? Like all professionals, social 
psychologists need a set of tools to carry out their job. The tool that they 
reach for most often is the experiment. Here I talk about the logic behind 
experiment design and how it gives scientists the ability to draw conclusions 
about the causal roots of human behaviour. To do so, I have to talk about 
something that can make people uncomfortable: statistics. If you are uneasy 
with maths and feel tempted to skip those sections, please stick it out. There 
are no intimidating formulae or equations in this chapter, I promise.
In this chapter, I show you how social psychologists combat the enemy glib 
common sense, and why the tools of experimental and statistical techniques 
are so important in building knowledge. I won’t go into the nuts and bolts of 
how you perform statistical calculations, but I want to convey the remark­
able connection social psychology can make between the ineffable qualities 
of human experience and the power of the scientific method. It makes social 
psychology much more interesting than talking about novels, and much 
harder to do than physics and chemistry. It may even encourage you to pick 
up a book on statistics.

Facing Social Psychology’s Greatest 
Enemy: Common Sense
When you excitedly tell people about the findings of a carefully performed, 
ingenious experiment in social psychology, a very common response you will 
hear is, ‘Well, that’s just common sense, isn’t it?’ If you are a student, you’ll 
hear this from friends who study other subjects and from your family at home. 
To them, after several years of hard study, you end up with a degree in basic 
common sense.
In this section, I pit social psychology knowledge against common sense 
knowledge. I show that things that seem obviously and boringly true to many 
people are shown to be simply false when scientists carry out careful experi­
ments. Why is it then that people often want to stick with their common-
sense beliefs and ignore the conclusions of social psychology? The answer 
to this is itself a fascinating bit of social psychology that I introduce here and 
discuss more in Part III of this book.
Social psychology in art and religion
The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest sto­
ries that our species has told that still survives 
to this day. It was created, we estimate, around 
4,000 years ago. Versions were written down on 
palm-sized stone tablets a few hundred years 
later and rediscovered in the nineteenth cen­
tury. It is the tale of a Gilgamesh, a king, of gods 
and monsters and the underworld. But it is not 
just a list of battles won and lost. It is a complex 
account of pride, jealously, love and friend­
ship (it’s also a cracking good read). Even our 
very earliest stories are psychologically rich. 
They contain knowledge about what motivates 
people, what they fear and how they love.
Scripture – the Vedas, the Bible, the Koran 
and the Torah – are similarly rich with social 
psychological insight. They contain parables 
about how people behave, what they believe 
and how they should act towards each other. 
In sermons, these stories are recounted to this 
day and applied to modern life. In many ways, 
this activity is a form of social psychology. For 
thousands of years, in a religious and artistic 
context, people have been making generalisa­
tions about human social behaviour and apply­
ing them to novel situations. But in one very 
important way, this knowledge is a long way 
short of science. These observations and gen­
eralisations are not distilled into theory, and 
they are not systematically tested. For that, we 
need the scientific method.

Challenging the notion of common sense
I once read a newspaper article in which the columnist was discussing a 
recent scientific paper. The researchers had found that when people experi­
enced long periods of anxiousness, they tended to gain weight. The columnist 
was angry that money had been spent to prove this fact. It was obvious from 
everyday experience that we eat when we are sad or nervous. He summed 
up the research in a wonderfully pithy remark: ‘This is just common sense 
expensively turned into science’. Common sense is social psychology’s great­
est enemy, blithely dismissing the results of scientific research.
Certainly, people have a rich sense of folk psychology, an understanding of 
others’ minds and behaviour that they use every day. But thinking that this is 
the same as a scientific understanding of behaviour is a big mistake. But don’t 
take my word for it: put your own common-sense knowledge to the test!

None of those statements was true. Even though each one seems to agree

every one is false.
You can read much more about the troublesome aspects of attitudes in

cuss group thinking in Chapter 16.

I don’t have evidence that proves that statement 5 is false. In fact, we don’t 
even need evidence here. Logically, the statement must be untrue. Consider 
this: heterosexual sex, by definition, means sex between a man and a woman. 
So if we are counting sexual partners, every time heterosexual sex takes 
place, there is one more male sexual partner and one more female. If we want 
to find out how many sexual partners men and women each have on average, 
we divide the number of male and female sexual partners by the number of 
men and women. Well, we’ve seen there are an equal number of sexual part­
ners of each sex, and there is an equal number of men and women. Therefore, 
they must have an equal number of sexual partners, on average. For much 
more on interpersonal relationships, check out Chapter 15, rather than rely­
ing on your common sense.
Accepting that common 
sense can be nonsense
If you found out that your own common sense wasn’t as good as you thought, 
then you can cheer yourself up by trying this experiment on your all-knowing 
friends and family. Tell a group of them that you’ve just been reading about 
a study of dating in your social psychology book. Explain that when it comes 
to personality types, opposites attract. Your audience may complain that 
they knew this all along: it’s just common sense. Then find another group 
of friends or family. Tell them that your book said that when it comes to 
Social psychology and society
Science seems ever more central to our lives 
and conversations. It is not just that science 
stories are headline news, like the discovery 
of the Higgs boson subatomic particle or the 
mapping of the human genome. The scientific 
perspective informs many stories and ideas 
in public discussions, and none more so than 
social psychology. When we talk about the best 
way to raise children, why some people commit 
horrible crimes (I discuss the idea of evil in 
Chapter 11), or even why a particular celebrity 
couple have broken up, a social scientist is 
often called upon.
As a scientist, this seems to me like a very posi­
tive step. It’s not because I think that current 
scientific views are necessarily correct and 
should dominate the discussion. It’s because 
increasingly people realise that what matters 
are not who holds the opinion and the volume 
with which they shout, but the evidence that 
supports an opinion. And scientists are the 
people who collect and analyse evidence. 
The increased attention to social science has 
a downside, however. It means that more and 
more, social psychology has to come face to 
face with its worst enemy: common sense.

personality types, people who are similar to each other get along the best. 
Once more, they may complain that this is obvious: it’s common sense that 
‘birds of a feather flock together’.
I’ve done this experiment many times in lectures. You can give half the people 
one statement, and the other half another statement that says the exact oppo­
site, like our dating example above. What happens is that most people, on 
average, think that these completely opposing statements are probably true, 
and that they knew them all along. This is a hallmark of common-sense knowl­
edge about psychology: it is perfectly happy to contradict itself. This is not 
the case at all in scientific social psychology.
Confirming biases in social thinking
Why is it that people so readily assert that a statement (or its opposite) exactly 
agrees with what they already knew? Well, social psychologists have studied 
this phenomenon and understand that it is a systematic bias in the way that 
we think about the world. Think back to our newspaper columnist reading that 
scientists found that anxious people gain weight. When he read this he prob­
ably thought of all the times he’s bought some chocolate to cheer himself up, or 
all the times he’s seen a sitcom character get dumped by her boyfriend, and in 
the next scene is eating a tub of ice cream in the kitchen. These memories and 
images all appear to confirm the idea that negative feelings cause weight gain, 
and so he feels that he knew the results of the study all along.
What if the columnist had read that scientists claim that anxiety leads people 
to lose weight? I think that he would have searched his memory and imag­
ined a gaunt, worried-looking person picking at his food and then pushing 
the plate away with a sigh. He may have remembered the time he came home 
from college depressed, and his mother asked if he was feeling okay because 
he looked like he’d lost weight. In other words, he would have been able to 
find an equal amount of anecdotal and remembered evidence that makes it 
common sense that negative feelings cause weight-loss.
This is called the confirmation bias. Common sense has a tendency to only 
seek out from memory evidence that confirms or supports an idea. We don’t 
tend to think of the contrary evidence against an idea. That is the job of the 
scientist. That is why we carefully use the scientific method to count con­
firming and disconfirming evidence, to weight them statistically and rule out 
competing explanations.
I cover biases relating to the self in Chapter 8 and write more about such 
biases in social thinking in Chapters 9 and 10. But for now, I want to make 
one thing clear. It may have seemed sometimes that I have been saying 
www.it-ebooks.info

46
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
that scientists are always right and non-scientists get things wrong. That is 
not what I think at all. These biases occur in everyone, scientists as well. 
In fact, there have been embarrassing cases of this. In the earlier section 
‘Challenging the notion of common sense’ I explained why it is impossible 
that heterosexual men could have a higher number of sexual partners, on 
average, than heterosexual women. Nevertheless, a paper was once pub­
lished in a social psychology journal making exactly that claim.
The researchers had carefully surveyed the student population of a small 
college town, asking about the number of times male and female students 
had had heterosexual sex with other members of the college community. 
They carried out a statistical analysis, wrote up their results, had the paper 
reviewed by an editor and other scientists in the field and got their paper 
published. It wasn’t until after it was published that someone else pointed 
out that their result was logically impossible. Apparently the finding that 
young males are sexually active fitted so well with everyone’s confirma­
tion bias that no one thought to question it rigorously. In fact, all that the 
researchers had shown is that young males will claim to have had more 
sexual partners than females. And that finding, even I will admit, is plain 
common sense.
Entering the Fascinating World of the 
Social Psychology Experiment
When I was in my youth, I wasted too much time playing video games. In one 
called Street Fighter II you had to combat ever more formidable enemies by 
bashing, punching, kicking and jumping. Every character you played had a 
special move, like launching fireballs or reaching into your enemies’ throats 
and pulling their skeletons out. To do these special moves you needed a 
complicated series of button presses. It was very hard to get right, but if you 
could pull off the special move, you were absolutely unstoppable.
Though common sense is a formidable enemy for social psychologists, they 
too have a special move: the scientific experiment. It is also tricky to get 
right, and certainly involves a lot of complicated button pressing. But if they 
get it right, social scientists can reach unstoppable conclusions.
In this section, I explain what an experiment is, and from where it gets its 
power. I explain the three key elements of a social psychology experiment – 
random assignment, manipulation and measurement – and show how they 
combine and what they can prove.

Appreciating the awesome power 
of the scientific method
Science is a systematic method that allows us to develop, test and reject 
theories. It doesn’t provide certainty, and it doesn’t produce theories that 
are always right. But in the long run, correctly applied, the scientific method 
always stumbles forward towards the truth, gradually building knowledge. 
This upward progress is very different to common-sense knowledge. We are 
no wiser in our everyday understanding of each other than our grandparents, 
or their grandparents. Common sense does not accumulate. But science, in 
the long run, is always building knowledge.
Experimenting with my make-up
When I was in college, I experimented with 
wearing eyeliner. I was doing some student 
theatre and once forgot to take off the eye­
liner after rehearsal. One girl in a pub said that 
it suited me, and so for a few weeks, I toyed 
around with a sort of New Romantic nerd look. 
As an experiment, I think it failed. This is a per­
fectly reasonable use of the word ‘experiment’, 
in the sense of ‘trying out’ or ‘investigating’, and 
it’s one that most people are quite familiar with. 
But it is a long way short of what we mean by 
an ‘experiment’ in psychology.
If I had really experimented with eyeliner, for 
example, I would have worn the make-up on 
a random or systematically varied set of days 
and toured a series of randomly chosen bars 
and pubs handing out a standardised survey 
to people I met. I could then have tested the 
hypothesis that eyeliner increased my limited 
attraction to other people by seeing if there was 
an increase greater-than-chance levels for the 
survey ratings when I was wearing make-up. 
But even this is a poor experiment by psychol­
ogy standards. Perhaps it is the case that the 
eyeliner just made me feel more artistic and 
interesting, and that change in my behaviour 
was perceived as more attractive (an unlikely 
hypothesis, I’ll admit, but possible).
A better test would be to have to have a friend 
apply the make-up for me, using either a real 
eyeliner pencil or a dummy pencil that left no 
mark. Now I wouldn’t know myself whether or 
not I was wearing the make-up while interact­
ing with others. If there was still a difference in 
the survey scores, we could rule out the con­
fidence explanation and have better evidence 
that the eyeliner made me more attractive.
I never did carry out that experiment properly, 
and I stopped wearing eyeliner after a few 
weeks. Sadly, it had more to do with the wither­
ing looks from my friends than any evidenced-
based conclusion. But it was around the same 
time that I switched from studying philosophy 
to studying psychology, and the reason was 
that I fell in love with experiments. In philoso­
phy, discussions and debates between great 
thinkers can stretch for centuries without being 
resolved. But the awesome power of experi­
ments means that if you follow the method 
properly, anyone can test a hypothesis and 
move our understanding forward.

You can think of the scientific method as a series of steps:
)>>
1.)>> Observe the world.
)>>
2.)>> Make up an explanation for what you see. This is called a hypothesis. 
You may come up with a particular hypothesis because it comes from a 
theory that you have.
)>>
3.)>> Test your hypotheses in an experiment. Hypotheses make predictions 
about what will happen, and an experiment is a way of finding out if that 
prediction is true. This involves carefully manipulating and measuring 
things about the world, which are called experimental variables. Analyse 
your data using statistics to see if the predictions came true.
)>>
4.)>> Did your predictions come true? You have support for your hypothesis, 
and support for your theory. Now you have to write up exactly what you 
did so that other people can perform the same experiment and get the 
same result. This is called replication, and it’s a vital part of the scien­
tific method. Now you can generate more hypotheses and predictions 
from your theory and go back to Step 2 to test them.
)>>
5.)>> Did your predictions not come true? You have to reject that hypothesis. 
If this has happened enough times, you may have to reject the whole 
theory as well. Go back to Step 2 and try modifying your theory, or start­
ing over again.
That, in essence, is the scientific method. In the few hundred years since we 
have started using it, it has produced new ways of understanding the heav­
ens, our bodies and matter itself. It generated ideas that were radically differ­
ent from any that had gone before. It produced the technology that powered 
the industrial and information revolutions. And much later, when we turned 
the method upon ourselves, it produced social psychology.
)>>
The scientific method as we know it began life in the thirteenth century in 
the universities of Europe. Before that time, there were societies such as the 
ancient Babylonians, the Greeks and Romans, the Abbasid Caliphate and the 
Han dynasty that were technologically gifted and made startlingly accurate 
observations of the world. But it wasn’t until the sixteenth-century Renaissance 
that people like Francis Bacon were able to articulate fully a scientific method, 
a way of acquiring knowledge by experimentation and hypothesis testing that 
could generate new and lasting knowledge.
There is one revolutionary thing about the scientific method. It comes between 
Steps 3 and 4 above. What decides which hypotheses we keep and which we 
throw away? It is whatever happens in your experiment. The universe itself 
decides which theories and beliefs we can hold. This was a revolution. Before 
www.it-ebooks.info

49
 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
that time people in authority decided what to believe: priests, kings and 
famous long-dead philosophers. The slogan of the Royal Society, the first sci­
entific institution, is Nullius in verba, or ‘take no one’s word for it’.
)>>
Let’s apply the method. Imagine you see someone collapsing on a neighbour­
ing train carriage while clutching their chest. No one goes to help, and this 
seems strange to you. You form a hypothesis that people sometimes don’t 
help strangers in distress because they feel incapable of doing anything useful 
by themselves. This generates the prediction that the more people are on the 
train carriage when one person is in distress, the more likely people are to 
help out. There is strength in numbers.
So you perform a careful experiment to test this hypothesis. You hire an actor 
to feign a heart attack on various different train carriages with different num­
bers of people on them and carefully measure the likelihood of people going 
over to the collapsed man and helping.
What you will find – I know because social psychologists have done precisely 
these experiments – is that the more people are on the train the less likely 
it is for other people to help. So your predictions were wrong, your hypoth­
esis can be rejected, and you may have to revise your assumptions and your 
theory. Or you may worry that you didn’t do the experiment correctly, and it 
has some flaws. For example, perhaps a full train carriage is filled with differ­
ent types of people (for example, commuters) than near-empty carriages (for 
example, tourists) and it is this difference that explains why some helped and 
others didn’t. So you go back, re-think your theory, refine your experiments 
and try again. And you are following the scientific method in all its glory.
Designing an experiment
In this section I describe devising an experiment to answer a simple question: 
does a cup of tea make someone nicer? I promise that the experiments in this 
book are often more interesting, but starting off simply is a good idea. We 
have a very simple hypothesis about the act of drinking tea and the effects it 
may have on social behaviour; specifically, how it may cause you to interact 
with people differently. So let’s test it.
In our first simple experiment, we have two people, Alan and Bob. The factor 
that we control is whether or not they have tea. Alan is in one experimental 
condition, and is given a cuppa. Bob is in the other group, and gets none. Then 
we measure something: they interact with a researcher and are videotaped. 
Later, other researchers (who don’t know what condition Alan and Bob are in) 
watch those tapes and write down how friendly Alan and Bob are acting. They 
count the number of smiles they give, the number of pleasantries they mutter, 
www.it-ebooks.info

50
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
and so on. Let’s say that Alan scores higher on our friendliness scale. Have we 
now proved that tea makes people nicer? Take a moment and think of other 
explanations for our results.
Your explanations can probably be placed into two categories: they may have 
something to do with the differences between people, Alan and Bob in this 
case, or they may be due to differences between experimental conditions, in 
this case, giving a cup of tea or not. The scientific method gives us remark­
able solutions to each of these two sets of problems.
Differences between people
Here are some reasons why Alan may have scored higher than Bob on the 
friendliness test after drinking a cup of tea:
)>>
✓)>>Alan has always been nicer than Bob.
)>>
✓)>>Bob didn’t sleep well last night, and so he’s feeling a bit grumpy today.
)>>
✓)>>The researcher reminded Bob of his ex-girlfriend who broke his heart 
and he is still bitter.
)>>
✓)>>Alan is wearing eyeliner and is feeling especially confident and flirty 
today.
The trouble is that there are a million potential differences between Alan and 
Bob. How can we be sure that their different scores on the test are due to the 
tea, and not due to one of these other factors? We could measure as many 
factors as possible (their friendliness scores prior to the test, their sleep 
levels, their opinions about the researcher) but how many do we need? And 
how do we know which to measure? The other issue is that we are really not 
interested in Alan and Bob in particular; we are interested in the effects of tea 
for all people.
Meeting Mr Average
The writer Kevin O’Keefe has found the ‘aver­
age American’: Bob Burns. O’Keefe looked at 
the results of as many surveys on Americans 
that he could possibly find. He looked at the 
average answers for each. Then he found the 
one person in the country who gave the most 
number of average answers. So, like the aver­
age American, Bob Burns eats peanut butter 
at least once a week and prefers smooth over 
chunky, he goes to church at least once a month 
and lives within a 20-minute drive of a Wal-Mart 
and three miles from McDonald’s. So if we carry 
out all our experiments on Bob Burns, would we 
learn something about the average American? 
Probably not. And Mr Burns might not be too 
keen on it either.

 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
This seems like an insurmountable problem. How do we deal with the fact 
that people differ in so many ways: their upbringing, their personality, their 
mood that day, whether or not they like the researcher, and so on. All of 
these could influence how they behave in our experiments. How do we dis­
count all these factors about people so that we can focus on the one thing we 
care about, whether it’s the effect of tea or any of the other things we study 
in social psychology?
If we have two groups of people, those who are given a cup of tea and those 
who are not, then we could try and make sure that in each group there are an 
equal number of nice people, an equal number of people who regularly drink 
tea, an equal number of men and women, an equal number of extroverts and 
introverts, an equal number of happy people and sad people. But we can’t 
possibly measure or control all of these factors ‒ there are just too many. So 
how do we make sure that these two groups of people are exactly the same in 
all aspects, apart from the fact that one group gets tea and the other does not?
The answer is quite remarkable: we give up. We don’t even try to measure or 
control all these factors. We do nothing, and leave it all in the hands of the 
gods. Or rather, we leave it up to chance. This is called random assignment. 
And it means that you place your participants at random in your experimen­
tal conditions. When people come into your lab you toss a coin, literally, to 
place them in the tea group or the non-tea group. And it is that little coin toss 
that solves the experimental problem of all the differences that exist between 
people.
)>>
It may seem like a small methodological detail, but random assignment is 
the keystone to the experimental method in social psychology. Sciences like 
chemistry don’t have this problem. Hydrogen molecules are identical to each 
other and behave the same the world over. But we study people, and they 
differ in all sorts of ways that changes how they behave. We can perform rigor­
ous scientific experiments on them, however, thanks to the power of random 
assignment.
Here’s the reasoning behind random assignment. If you place people into two 
groups at random, then you can be pretty sure that whatever you measure 
about them ‒ height, intelligence, a liking for eighties pop music ‒ the average 
for those two groups will be more or less the same. We can go even further 
than this though. Over the past few hundred years we have developed very 
clever statistical tools. They can tell us with great precision how likely it is 
that a difference between two groups is because of random chance.
In short, we can’t measure or control all the ways in which people vary. So in 
experiments we assign them to groups at random, because we know exactly 
what randomness looks like. In our tea example, we can randomly assign 
people to the tea and no-tea group. If the test scores are different between 
www.it-ebooks.info

52
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
these two groups, we can say whether that difference is due to randomness, 
or due to a real difference in their behaviour. And if they are behaving differ­
ently, then we can be certain that it is because of the fact that some had tea 
and some did not, and that it is not because we just happened to get happier, 
friendlier, less sleepy participants in one group rather than the other.
Note that this logic only works if your participants really are randomly 
assigned. Say, for example, that you carried out this tea experiment at a 
university and did it in two stages, in the morning and the afternoon. Your 
participants could sign up for either one of the two slots. This is not random 
assignment. It could be that people who chose the morning slot are more 
motivated, outgoing students who are going to score better on the friendli­
ness test.
Capturing randomness
How far apart do two averages have to be 
for you to conclude that they are not due to 
chance? Say you always seem to lose when 
your friend tosses a particular lucky coin that 
she carries around. You are suspicious, so you 
borrow the coin, take it home and toss it 100 
times. You would expect 50 heads if the coin 
was fair: if it had an equal chance of coming up 
heads or tails. But you wouldn’t be too alarmed 
if you got 52 heads. Or maybe 55. But if you got 
70 heads, would you start to worry that your 
friend was cheating? How do you know how 
many heads is too many?
Using statistics we can put precise probabilities 
on these different outcomes. We can say that if 
the coin is fair, then there is a 38 per cent chance 
that you’d get 52 or more heads out of 100 tosses. 
That’s not unlikely at all. But there is only an 
18 per cent chance of getting 55 or more, and 
a 0.004 per cent chance of getting 70 or more.
So now we have quantified these probabilities, 
the question still remains: how unlikely does 
the number of coin tosses have to be before we 
say that the coin is not fair? We have agreed in 
social science that we would draw a line in the 
sand and say that if something has a less than 
5 per cent chance of happening, then it has not 
happened by random chance alone. Something 
else is going on. For the coin toss example, you 
would need to get 59 or more heads out of 100 
to cross this 5 per cent mark. If that happened, 
you would have scientific grounds for picking 
an argument with your friend over her lucky 
coin.
Similarly, say you carry out your experiment, 
analyse your results and find out there is a 6 per 
cent chance of getting the differences that you 
found by chance. The convention is that you 
have not really found anything at all: those small 
differences are just random. But if you find out 
that there is a less than 5 per cent chance of 
getting your results, you can conclude that it is 
more than random chance at work: you have a 
significant result.

 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
Or to take another example, say the researcher decides to put people in 
different groups according to the first letter of their surnames. This is not 
random: people who come from the same parts of the world often have simi­
lar surnames. So this technique will tend to put unequal numbers of different 
cultures and ethnicities in the two groups. Random assignment only works 
if it is done by the researcher, and if it is truly random.
Differences between experimental conditions
Random assignment solves the problem of all the differences that exist between 
participants in our experiments. Going back to our experiment about tea with 
Alan and Bob, you may have thought of other explanations for why they scored 
differently on the friendliness test. We want to see if tea has an effect on friend­
liness, but if Alan scores higher than Bob after having a cuppa, it could be 
because:
)>>
✓)>>Hot drinks warm you up, and it was a cold day, which made people with­
out tea grumpy.
)>>
✓)>>Being well hydrated increases your friendliness.
)>>
✓)>>Bob was a bit upset when he saw Alan being given a cup of tea. He felt a 
bit resentful towards the researcher and so was unfriendly.
)>>
✓)>>People believe that they feel better when they have had a tea in the 
morning. This belief gave Alan a mood boost and led him to act friend­
lier towards the researcher.
So why did the drink help Alan? Was it because of the tea specifically, or 
because of these other reasons? How can we rule out these other explana­
tions? To deal with the differences between people, we could use the power 
of random assignment. Sadly, there is no such magic bullet for dealing with 
this problem.
The issue is that we have one specific factor that we want to study: our 
experimental hypothesis is that an increase in tea consumption will improve 
performance on the friendliness scale. But look at our two experimental 
conditions – having a cup of tea and not having a cup of tea. These two con­
ditions certainly do differ in that one crucial factor of tea. But they also differ 
in a whole host of other ways – drinking fluid, being warmed up, being given 
something nice by the experimenter, and so on. The technical term for these 
other factors is confounds or confounding variables. They are unwanted dif­
ferences between experimental conditions. They are unwanted because we 
can’t tell if the difference between conditions scores is due to the one factor 
that we care about, or all the other confounding variables.
www.it-ebooks.info

54
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
)>>
When two social psychologists argue over a result, it is usually because one 
thinks that the other has confounding variables in their experiment. It is 
often very difficult to design experiments on social behaviour without any 
confounds at all. When you read about new research, think carefully about 
whether there are any confounding variables that could provide a different 
explanation to that of the original researchers.
The problem is well known, and it’s more easily dealt with in other sciences 
like medicine. When testing a new drug, a doctor gives one group the real 
drug and another group a placebo, a pill that looks the same but has no medi­
cal effect. This ensures that in every regard – visits to the doctor, the belief 
that they are in a trial, the hope that they will get better – the two groups are 
identical. They only difference is whether or not they have had the drug.
But in social psychology isolating and controlling experimental conditions 
is often much harder because we are studying people’s social behaviour, 
which is based on their experience of the real world where causal factors are 
often interrelated. Take the case of the ‘own race bias’ for faces that has been 
shown in many experiments. It means, for example, White Americans can 
recognise and remember the faces of other White Americans better than they 
can recognise and remember the faces of Black Americans.
Can we conclude that people are better at processing faces from their own 
racial group? Well, yes, in a sense. But from the evidence I’ve presented here, 
it may not be anything to do with race exactly. Societies are still racially seg­
regated, to some degree. If you are White in America you are more likely, on 
average, to spend time with other White people. In other words, there is a 
confounding variable at work. For White participants, Black faces are from 
another social group, but also they are less familiar faces. Are the differences 
between White and Black faces to do with racial groups or are they to do with 
faces that are familiar? As we will see in Chapter 10, researchers have done a 
lot of work deconfounding these variables. But I hope you get a sense of how 
complicated this issue can be in social psychology.
The best way round the problem of confounding variables is to redesign 
the experiment more carefully. The ideal case is where the only difference 
between the two conditions is the one factor that you care about. In our 
example, our experimental hypothesis is that the presence of tea improves 
friendliness. So, a much better design would be to give both groups a hot 
beverage. In one condition the researcher makes a cup of regular tea. In the 
other, it is hot water with milk, sugar and de-caffeinated tea substitute. Have 
we removed all the confounds now? Well, not quite. . . .
Are we sure that the two drinks taste the same? We could improve the 
research by also running a little taste test before the main experiment, to 
see if other participants can tell the difference between the two drinks, or 
www.it-ebooks.info

55
 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
whether they have a preference for one over the other. This is good, but 
even assuming that the two drinks taste the same, there is one confound 
remaining.
In our current design, when the researchers hand over a hot cup, they know 
whether it has tea in it or not. You may find it surprising, but we have good 
evidence to believe that the knowledge that the researchers have about the 
experimental condition has the potential to influence the participants’ behav­
iour and change the results.
Experiments in schools, for example, have involved a scientist entering a 
classroom and taking some children out of the room for ‘cognitive testing’. 
The teacher was told which children scored in the ‘highly intelligent’ cat­
egory. Later, the scientist returned to the classroom. They asked the teacher 
to grade the children’s performance, and carry out their own tests.
In fact, no real ‘cognitive testing’ took place in the first instance. The scientist 
picked some children at random and told the teacher that they were highly 
intelligent. This false information had two effects. It increased the teacher’s 
estimation of the students’ performance. But it also increased the students’ 
performance on the second test. What probably happened is that the teacher 
formed a positive opinion of the ‘highly intelligent’ students. They then gave 
them more attention, called on them to answer questions and perhaps gave 
them questions to stretch themselves. In this way, the teacher’s expectations 
changed the children’s behaviour and their test scores.
Similarly, in the course of a social psychology experiment, if a researcher has 
knowledge about the condition and expects participants to react in a certain 
way, that expectation can change the participants’ behaviour. So an even 
better design for our experiment would have a second researcher make the 
two drinks, one real tea and the other not, in a red and blue mug. The drinks-
maker would then hand the mugs to the other researcher, without saying 
which drink was which. Now we have something approaching a good design. 
The only difference between the two conditions is the presence or absence of 
tea. But there is still one thing left to worry about. . . .
Operationalisation: Turning concepts 
into things you can count
)>>
Operationalisation is what makes social psychology a science. It is the process 
of taking a concept – conformity, prejudice, happiness, guilt, relief, attraction, 
boredom – and turning it into something that we can observe and measure. 
For example, with the tea experiment, we said that we wanted to test if it 
makes people nicer. How do we operationalise this? What is the correct 
measure for ‘niceness?
www.it-ebooks.info

56
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Of course, in sciences like physics and chemistry they have it easy. They 
have scales, speedometers, litmus paper and thermometers. All these 
devices can measure a concept like mass, mass, acidity and heat and put a 
number on it. Easy. But we have no gadgets with dials and read-outs that can 
tell us how happy people are, whether they like someone or whether they 
are obedient. So in social psychology, we have to work very hard to come up 
with ways that we can measure and quantify these things.
Often, we can just ask people to give us the numbers. ‘How happy are you, 
on a scale from 1 to 7?’, for example. But often, asking people questions 
like this doesn’t work, because we are measuring an unconscious process 
that they can’t tell us about, or because they feel pressure to give a socially 
acceptable answer, or because we don’t want them to know what the experi­
ment is studying. This is the great challenge of social science, but it’s one of 
the reasons that it can be an unusually creative science. Here are some real 
examples of operationalisations in social psychology:
)>>
✓)>>Liking. An experimenter interviews the participant. During the interview 
he subtly mimics the participant’s posture and gestures, to see if that 
makes him more likeable. At the end of the interview, the experimenter 
‘accidentally’ knocks a box of pencils off of the table. Liking is opera­
tionalised as the number of pencils that the participant helps the experi­
menter pick up before leaving.
)>>
✓)>>Attraction. Female researchers gave a survey interview to male partici­
pants while they were standing on a low bridge or a high bridge. At the 
end of the survey they gave them a phone number to call so that partici­
pants could find out the results of the survey. The researchers weren’t 
interested in the survey at all. They were operationalising interpersonal 
attraction as whether or not the participants called back the researcher 
and asked for a date. Participants were more likely to do this if they 
had met the researcher on a high bridge. They had mistaken the fear 
that they felt standing on the high bridge for arousal towards the other 
person.
)>>
✓)>>Obedience. Participants walked around a field in groups. They either 
wandered at their own pace or marched in time with each other. Later 
they were ordered to throw handfuls of small grubs down a chute that 
led into a grinder. Obedience to authority was operationalised as the 
number of grubs that they threw down the chute, following these orders. 
No grubs were hurt, as the chute actually led off into another box. But 
participants threw more down the chute if previously they had been 
marching together.
You will see a great range of other operationalisations in this book. For each, 
the question you have to ask yourself is – does this operationalisation mea­
sure what it is supposed to measure?

Understanding Experiments 
and Statistics
Now you understand something of the power and the difficulties of the scien­
tific method. In this section, I show how to apply that understanding to the 
experiments that you read about in this book, in the media and in scientific 
articles. To do this, you need a basic grasp of scientific jargon and statistics. 
Long technical words and alien mathematical language is what puts off many 
people from grappling with scientific research. But it needn’t. In the later sec­
tion ‘Taking to heart experimental terminology’ I show how a smattering of 
scientific jargon is enough to unlock the most hard-to-read social psychology 
study. And you don’t need to know how to carry out any complicated calcula­
tions to understand why scientists use statistics and what they can reveal. 
I demonstrate that if you understand some basic ideas behind statistics, you 
see how they allow scientists to collect evidence for their theories. I also 
describe how you can apply these ideas when reading about the experiments 
in this book and elsewhere.
The first social psychology experiment
Though it is hotly debated, the first social 
psychological experiment was probably the 
one performed by Norman Triplett at Indiana 
University in 1898. He was watching bike riders 
train, and noticed that times were faster when 
people rode in groups compared to alone. He 
carefully excluded various physical factors. 
The effect was not due solely to the lead bike 
rider breaking the air currents, for example, or 
because people pedal in a more regular rhythm 
when they can see others. He concluded that 
people were more motivated to perform when 
in the presence of others. In other words, he 
gave one of the first social explanations for an 
individual’s behaviour, and he termed it social 
facilitation.
Social facilitation refers to the finding that 
people perform tasks better when they are in 
the presence of others. It’s been shown to be 
true even for cockroaches, who speed though 
mazes faster when being watched by other 
cockroaches. However, Max Ringelmann, a 
European researcher, tried to investigate the 
same phenomena. He asked people to chop 
wood, either alone or in groups. He found 
that people in groups tended to chop less. He 
argued that this was because they could see 
others were performing the task and so were 
less motivated, and termed this social loafing. 
This story, from the first ever social psychology 
experiment, has two important lessons for us. 
Firstly, you have to be very careful in generalis­
ing from one situation to another. Secondly, you 
have to be very careful generalising from one 
culture to another, as we see in Chapter 17.

For this section, imagine an experiment that studies how people conform to 
those around them. (You can read about real experiments on this topic in 
Chapter 13.) We set up an experiment where participants are asked to go up 
two floors in a lift. Before taking the trip themselves, they watch other people 
call the lift by doing a quick double-press of the button. When the partici­
pants call the lift, will they do a double-press too? Rationally, we all know that 
one button press is enough to call the elevator, but people are disposed to 
conform to other’s behaviour even when they have no rational reason for it.
We want to study one thing in particular. Are people more likely to conform to 
the behaviour of other people who are in the same social group as them? In 
this case, we are going to have participants from University College London. 
The other people they observe will all be actors following my instructions. 
They will be wearing clothing that identifies them as either University College 
London students or as Imperial College London students from across town. 
Our research question is this: will our participants’ conformity be determined 
by college membership?
Taking to heart experimental terminology
As with all disciplines, experimental design has its own jargon. Making the 
effort to understand these terms is worthwhile though, as it can really help 
clarify your thinking. When you read about an experiment try and identify 
these different elements to help you grasp the structure and logic of the 
experiment, and so judge its strength.
Participants
These are the human beings who took part in the experiment. We used to call 
them ‘subjects’, and you still come across that word in older research papers 
(or from older researchers). In our example experiment, the participants are 
students from University College London.
Independent variables or experimental conditions
These are things that the researcher controls. Sometimes we say that they 
manipulate these variables. In our example, we are manipulating the indepen­
dent variable of the social group of the passers-by. Or, we may say that this 
experiment has two experimental conditions: the in-group condition (passers-
by are wearing UCL clothing) and the out-group condition (they are wearing 
Imperial College London clothing).

 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
Dependent variable
This is the main thing that the researcher measures. It’s the focus of the 
experiment and the predictions that the researcher has made. If you see 
a table or a graph of some data, it’s almost certain to be of the dependent 
variable.
In this example, we want to study conformity, which could refer to many dif­
ferent types of behaviour. We have operationalised conformity here to one 
particular behaviour: pressing an elevator button twice after seeing others do 
so. This is something specific that we can measure. We could also have oper­
ationalised it as how long it takes participants to do their first double-press, 
or how many times after that they repeat the action. We could even measure 
how hard they press the button each time.
Experimental hypothesis
This is a statement that connects the independent variables with the depen­
dent variable. It is the crux of the experiment: it is the point where the data 
meets the theory. In our example the experimental hypothesis is that the 
group membership of the passers-by will influence the degree of conformity 
displayed by participants.
Null hypothesis
This is the statement that there is no connection between the independent 
and dependent variables: that the experimental hypothesis is wrong. So here, 
our null hypothesis is that the clothing of the passers-by will have no effect 
at all on the levels of conformity displayed by participants.
Covariates
These are things that the researchers may measure, but they are not the 
focus of the experiment. For example, the researcher may keep track of the 
age of participants because they expect older participants to make decisions 
more slowly. This age effect is not really relevant to the experimental hypoth­
esis, so the researchers simply keep track of the ages of participants so that 
they can account for them in their analysis.
Descriptive statistics
These are numbers or graphs that summarise the data. The most common 
example is the average values of the dependent variables in different conditions.
www.it-ebooks.info

60
Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Inferential statistics
These are the statistical analyses that weigh up the differences that were 
found in the data. The results of the analyses are presented in many ways, 
but usually a p value is reported. This is the probability that the differences 
found were due to chance. If the p value is less than 5 per cent (usually writ­
ten as p < 0.05) then the differences are said to be statistically significant. In 
other words, they are not due to chance.
)>>
Remember statistical significance has a precise statistical meaning of some­
thing not being due to random chance alone. ‘Significant’ results are not neces­
sarily important, newsworthy or exciting (although the researcher who found 
them probably feels that they are). So when writing essays about research, be 
careful to be clear about which sense of the word you are using.
)>>
In science, we can never really prove that a theory is true. This may sound 
pessimistic, but it is an essential part of the scientific method. All we can 
do in science is use evidence to reject or falsify a hypothesis or a theory. An 
experiment is like an axe: all it can do is chop things down. Experiments never 
directly prove that a theory is right; all they can do is provide indirect support 
by rejecting all the other theories until only one plausible theory remains. For 
example, sometimes you hear people say things like ‘evolution is only a theory: 
science has never proved it’. Well, that’s true, but only in the sense that sci­
ence never proves that any theory is positively true. But what the theory of 
evolution has done is assembled an enormous amount of convincing data prov­
ing that other competing theories are false. So though it hasn’t been ‘proved’, 
overwhelmingly, evolution is the best theory that we have to explain the data 
we have. And that’s as good as we get with the scientific method.
Drawing conclusions
The scientific method has rules determining what you are allowed to con­
clude, given your data and your inferential statistics. When social psycholo­
gists review each other’s papers, they pay extremely close attention to these 
rules and won’t allow the paper to be published if they think the rules have 
been broken.
Often, the most important outcome of a researcher’s statistical analysis is 
the p value – the probability that the results were due to chance or due to a 
real effect of the experimental manipulations. The convention is that if the 
probability is greater than 5 per cent, then we conclude that the differences 
between conditions were just due to random chance. In this case, the null 
hypothesis is supported and the data don’t allow you to say anything much 
at all. In this case, you’d find it very hard to get your experiment published in 
a journal, because your data allow you to say very little.
www.it-ebooks.info

61
 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
But, if the inferential statistics say that the results have a less than 5 per cent 
chance of occurring by chance, then the differences are judged to be too 
large for random chance. In this case, they are called significant differences: 
this means that the null hypothesis can be rejected.
)>>
Significant results do not prove that the experimental hypothesis is true. All 
they show is that you can reject the null hypothesis. In other words, you have 
proved that there is some connection between your independent and depen­
dent variables. That connection could be the one described by your experi­
mental hypothesis, or it could be some other explanation that you have not 
yet ruled out or even thought of.
What does this 5 per cent significance level really mean? Think back to the 
example of the suspicious lucky coin in the sidebar ‘Capturing randomness’ 
earlier in the chapter. We said that if you got 59 or more heads, the scientific 
convention would be to conclude that the coin was not fair. But remember, 
it’s not the case at all that the coin is definitely fair if you get 58 heads, but 
your friend is definitely cheating if you get 59. It’s just that as the number of 
heads increases, we know that the odds of it being fair get increasing lower. 
Similarly, it is not really the case that an experiment with a p value of greater 
than 5 per cent has found nothing at all, but an experiment with a p value of 
less than 5 per cent is certain to have genuine and real differences.
The 5 per cent mark is entirely arbitrary. We just plucked the figure out of the 
air about 100 years ago and never got round to changing it. The 5 per cent 
mark was a rough compromise between what people thought was very unlikely 
(a 1 per cent chance) and not that unlikely at all (a 10 per cent chance). No real 
scientific or mathematical basis for it exists at all.
You may feel a bit surprised about this. We have a very rigorous scientific 
method detailing how experiments are designed. We have complex statisti­
cal techniques to quantify probability with great precision. And all of these 
highly sophisticated tools are aimed at a target ‒ the 5 per cent significance 
level ‒ that is just made up. Seems strange, doesn’t it? Does it mean, for 
example, that 5 per cent of all psychology experiments that you read about 
are probably just due to chance? That’s one in 20 experiments in every jour­
nal and textbook that are simply wrong!
Luckily, this is not the case. Social psychology, like other sciences, has a 
practice of replicating results. This means that after someone runs an experi­
ment, other researchers in other laboratories across the world try and copy 
the experiment exactly and get the same results. If they don’t, we go back to 
the drawing board and try and figure out why. So even though each individual 
experiment has only got to pass the 5 per cent significance level, overall, 
through a process of replication, we can build up a set of ideas and data that 
are solid and reliable.

Part I: Getting Started with Social Psychology 
Strengthening evidence
In the past few years, many researchers have become worried about the stan­
dards of evidence in our field, and in particular our reliance on the 5 per cent 
significance level. There are two reasons for concern. One is that we are not 
spending enough time replicating results and sharing the replication data. 
There are some experiments, the argument goes, that were not adequately 
replicated before or after they were published in high profile journals and 
written into textbooks. And if people do try and replicate the experiment, but 
don’t get the right results, no one knows about it because they can’t publish 
an experiment that has ‘failed’ to replicate. These practices run the risk of 
allowing weak results to become accepted knowledge.
The other concern is more serious. Several high-profile cases of scientific 
fraud have occurred recently, where researchers have simply made up data 
or fiddled their results to get significance. If we aren’t replicating results 
enough, and if we are only relying on the 5 per cent significance level, the 
concern is that these cases of fraud will go undetected.
The good news is that many people in social psychology are trying to tackle 
these problems head on. Firstly, they are setting up journals, websites and 
lab groups that are focused on systematic replications and sharing of data, 
regardless of the results. Secondly, social psychologists are becoming increas­
ingly sophisticated in how they handle their data. Rather than just relying on 
a p value, providing statistics that give a more in-depth view of the size and 
the nature of the effect is becoming increasingly common. Many journals ask 
researchers to publish all of their data online too, so that other researchers 
can independently analyse their results.
Social psychology’s problems of fraud and non-replication have even reached 
the popular media in the last few years. The downside is some temporary 
embarrassment and the fact that that some ‘textbook’ results may have to be 
re-written. But the upside is that these problems have provoked a vigorous 
re-evaluation of how we carry out research in social psychology that can only 
strengthen our science.
Recognising good and bad 
social experiments
The results of an experiment are only as good as the quality of the experi­
ment itself. I argue above that as social psychologists, we have to be very 
wary of common sense. Believing the conclusion of an experiment just 
www.it-ebooks.info

63
 Chapter 3: Kitting Out: The Tools of Social Psychology
because it agrees with what you thought in the first place is very easy. A good 
scientist always weighs the strength of the experimental methods and the 
evidence, rather than the appeal of the conclusion.
For example, one study asked whether differences between males and females 
could be observed in very young babies. This is a good question to ask. 
Some people think that differences between the sexes are hard-wired into our 
biology, others that our culture expects boys to act one way and girls to act 
another way, and that children slowly learn this from society as they grow up 
and act accordingly.
So the researchers tested their hypothesis. They found babies who were 
younger than two weeks old by getting the hospital records from a maternity 
ward. They observed those babies and counted simple things about their 
activity, like how much they moved their limbs and how often they cried.
They found that boys were more active. Not a lot, but there was a statistically 
significant difference. They waggled their arms and legs more. Also they cried 
more and were louder. This conformed with the belief that many people have 
that boys are noisier and more energetic than girls, and showed that this dif­
ference was present very early on, presumably before the boy and girl babies 
could learn how they were ‘supposed’ to act. So, is this good evidence that 
such differences between the sexes are innate?
Well, in this case, there was a confounding variable. It turned out that the 
hospital that gave the researchers the birth records was in New York, and it 
served a predominantly Jewish area of the city. And often, eight days after 
a Jewish boy is born, he is circumcised. So in fact, there is another explana­
tion for why those boys may have been waggling their legs a little more and 
crying a little louder.
Of course, other studies have been done since, and researchers have found 
some slight differences between boys and girls. The point of the story is that 
good scientists have to be incredibly careful to avoid confounding variables, 
weaknesses in their experiment design and problems in their analyses. They 
can’t simply agree with a conclusion because it seems to be true.
What I would like you to do is keep many of the ideas from this chapter in 
your mind as you read about the experiments in this book and elsewhere. See 
if you can think of alternative explanations for any finding or claim. At the 
end of this book in Chapter 18 I give you a checklist of things to ask when you 
read a claim in social psychology. But for now, be inquisitive, sceptical and 
constructive. Soon enough, you’ll be making up experiments yourself.

Five Things You Need to 
Know about Attitudes
)>>
✓)>> Knowing what an attitude is: An attitude is the value the person places on something, and 
researchers often refer to that ‘something’ as the attitude object. An attitude is an evalua­
tion, at the simplest level, as to whether or not the attitude object is good or bad.
)>>
✓)>> Understanding your ABC: Every attitude has three dimensions. These are Affect (attitudes 
embody feelings and emotions), Behaviour (attitudes connect to the way you actually behave) 
and Cognition (attitudes are expressed in thoughts and speech). It’s as easy as ABC.
)>>
✓)>> Getting what attitudes do: Attitudes have four basic functions: The knowledge function (they 
help you make sense of the world); the utilitarian function (they can serve a practical purpose, 
and achieve goals); the ego defence function (they help you to have a positive view of your­
self); the value-expressive function (they express values fundamental to who you are).
)>>
✓)>> Attitudes can be measured: By asking the right questions in the right way, you can estab­
lish a subject’s basic attitudes on any subject. Ask a lot of questions to a lot of subjects, 
and you can measure attitudes society-wide.
)>>
✓)>> Attitudes can be influenced by asking questions in the right way: Even when people tell 
you their attitudes towards something, these stated attitudes don’t necessarily match up 
with how they’re going to behave in the future, or what they really think. Exactly how the 
researcher asks the question can strongly determine the answer.

Troublesome Atoms of 
Social Psychology
In This Chapter
▶)>>Understanding attitudes

▶)>>Considering the complications of attitudes
A

ttitudes are the set of likes, loves, peeves and preferences that encom­
pass your opinion of the world around you. Attitudes are vitally 
important, affecting how people conduct their personal relationships and 
how they organise wider society. In democracies, people’s attitudes select 
leaders or throw them out of office. If a society is consumer-based, people’s 
attitudes towards a product can bring a company riches or ruin.
Consider the Internet for a moment. People often think of it as a massive 
store of knowledge where they discover information by reading newspapers 
or turning to Wikipedia. But social psychologists see Internet users as not 
consuming knowledge, but trading attitudes: sharing pictures and articles, 
‘liking’ each other’s Facebook posts and watching particular videos because 
millions of others are watching those clips that day. Hit counters, trends, 
comments and ‘likes’ are the ways in which people’s attitudes shape the 
Internet. When social psychologists look at the Internet, they see less of an 
information superhighway and more of an attitude superhighway. For a little 
more detail, see the nearby sidebar ‘Think your attitudes don’t count?’.

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Measuring, understanding and predicting people’s attitudes are central to their 
lives and to social psychology. Indeed, some experts think of attitudes as the 
atoms of social psychology ‒ the fundamental building blocks of social thought. 
But just as scientists now understand that atoms can’t explain everything that 
they observe, and that other particles and forces are at work, social scientists 
know that attitudes aren’t quite as straightforward as people imagine.
In this chapter, I show you how scientists seek to understand these atoms 
of social psychology, introducing a few tools such as surveys and polls that 
psychologists use to measure attitudes. I also cover some of the forces that 
influence people’s attitudes and reveal how problems arise when researchers 
rely on people declaring their ‘true’ attitudes. The fact is that stated attitudes 
don’t always reflect behaviour.
Adopting an Attitude to Attitudes
Like so many terms in social psychology, the word ‘attitude’ is used a lot in 
everyday speech. Therefore, you need to be quite clear about its meaning in 
a scientific context.
)>>
Essentially, someone’s attitude is the value the person places on something, 
and researchers often refer to that ‘something’ as the attitude object. An atti­
tude is an evaluation, at the simplest level, whether or not the attitude object 
is good or bad. The technical term for this evaluation is valence, which in this 
context means nothing more than a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down.
Think your at⁜titudes don’t count?
Your attitudes shape the Internet in ways that 
you may not realise. Companies such as Google 
and Facebook try and keep track of what web­
sites you visit, what pages you like and what 
things you purchase. They sell this product to 
advertisers: bundles of information all about 
your attitudes. Each time you do a Google 
search, for example, the company uses at least 
50 bits of information about you to decide which 
webpages to show you, which to hide and 
which products to advertise. Therefore, your 
attitudes are shaping continually the world you 
see online.

 Chapter 4: Appraising At⁜titudes: The Troublesome Atoms of Social Psychology
Although a set of attitudes can be complicated, mixed up and even contra­
dictory, individually they’re quite simple. For example, I have a certain atti­
tude towards junk food. Mostly it’s a negative attitude, because I know it’s 
unhealthy and greasy. But occasionally, when I’m in the right mood or very 
hungry, I have some positive attitudes towards junk food as well.
The difficult job for social psychologists is to understand such opposing atti­
tudes, so that they can predict ‒ and perhaps influence ‒ when I may choose 
to be virtuous (nibbling delicately on a green salad) and when I’ll choose to 
be unhealthy (gorging on a double bacon cheeseburger).
In this section, I investigate a useful way to approach attitudes, the effects 
they can have and how psychologists attempt to measure them.
Discovering the three dimensions 
of attitudes
In the 1960s, psychologists Rosenberg and Hovland provided a clear and 
simple way to think about attitudes. They said that every attitude has three 
dimensions, the ABCs of attitudes:
)>>
✓)>>Affect: The term that psychologists use for feelings and emotions. It 
means that every attitude has a positive or negative emotional aspect. 
Imagine a measurement scale going from extreme dislike at one end, 
through mild disliking, to liking and on to extreme love. Every attitude 
is somewhere along this scale. I sometimes think of this as the Marmite 
component: everyone has a feeling towards Marmite, whether it’s posi­
tive or negative.
)>>
✓)>>Behaviour. Attitudes should connect to actions and behaviour somehow. If 
you say, ‘I hate Marmite’, and then happily eat some on toast when offered 
it, seem to enjoy it and buy some later, your attitude is probably not that 
you hate Marmite. In the ‘Having an Attitude Problem’ section later in the 
chapter, I explain that scientists have uncovered a puzzling and compli­
cated relationship between attitudes and actions. But as a starting defini­
tion that tries to capture the meaning of the word, Rosenberg and Hovland 
thought that attitudes should have at least some connection to behaviour.
)>>
✓)>>Cognition. Attitudes can be expressed in thought or in speech: they 
have a cognitive component. If you ask someone, ‘Do you like Marmite?’ 
and he simply shrugs, unable to say anything, he doesn’t really have an 
explicit attitude. Of course, he may well have an implicit attitude that 
you can detect in his behaviour, as I discuss in Chapter 5. But if you 
can’t say what your attitude is, under Rosenberg and Hovland’s scheme, 
you don’t have one.

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Understanding what attitudes do
You can have a certain attitude towards something for many reasons. I cover 
how your experiences, observations and biases produce your particular 
opinions and preferences in connection with making judgements about other 
people in Chapter 10, but here I discuss the functions that your attitudes per­
form: what they do for you. In 1960, the psychologist Daniel Katz described 
four different functions, and this framework is still useful today.
Knowledge function
Your attitudes are part of how you understand the world. Even though 
attitudes are subjective rather than objective facts and figures, they still 
help you organise this objective information and focus on what facts are 
important.
So you probably have a negative attitude towards Adolf Hitler, because of his 
responsibility for the Second World War and the Holocaust, and not due to 
the fact that he was a vegetarian and a painter.
)>>
In other words, your attitudes focus you on one set of facts over another.
Utilitarian function
Utilitarian indicates that your attitudes can serve a practical purpose. They 
can help you to achieve important goals. As I discuss in Chapter 13, one goal 
that everyone has in life is to feel part of a group. Adopting attitudes that are 
in agreement with other group members is a powerful way to feel closer to 
them. Have you ever pretended to like a band you’ve never heard of, or love a 
book you’ve never read, just to fit in with a group of people that you want to 
accept you?
Adopting attitudes can serve other functions too. Expressing a negative view 
of people who drink and drive, for example, can reduce that behaviour in 
society. This aspect of attitude function is sometimes called instrumentality, 
the key idea being that each attitude is a means towards an end.
Ego defence function
By ego defence, I mean that people are happier when they have a positive 
view of themselves. But your self-esteem can come under attack from all 
quarters: an F grade on an essay, a relationship break-up text on your phone 
or the smug look on a 6-year-old’s face as he beats you at chess.
www.it-ebooks.info

71
 Chapter 4: Appraising At⁜titudes: The Troublesome Atoms of Social Psychology
)>>
One function of attitudes is to protect people against these potentially harmful 
effects. If you think that the teacher who gave the grade is an idiot, that you 
never liked the loser you’d been dating or that you let the child win because 
you’re a nice person, these experiences don’t reflect too badly upon you. In 
Chapter 8, you see how people are systematically biased in how they view 
themselves and discover how attitudes protect you from harm.
Value expressive function
Some of your attitudes are more than preferences and whims: they express 
values that are fundamental to who you are. For example, equality may be an 
important principle to you, which determines how you react to unfairness 
in the world, which political parties you support and even the career that 
you choose. These values are some of the strongest attitudes that people 
hold: they’re most resistant to change and have the strongest influence on 
behaviour.
)>>
Recent evidence shows that expressing your core values seems to boost your 
mental functioning. If you want to perform better on a test, have more will­
power to resist temptation or be a more insightful and effective negotiator, try 
writing down a little list of your own core values beforehand.
Finding ways to measure attitudes
As you know, people measure attitudes by asking other people. Some surveys 
and questionnaires ask about objective facts, such as your height, weight or 
income, but these aren’t attitudes. The questions that measure your attitudes 
are ones that seek your subjective opinion about something (are you happy 
with your weight? Do you think you should be paid more?).
Subjective questions can be simple and direct (such as whether you like 
Marmite) or multifaceted, asking about many different aspects of an attitude. 
For example, to investigate a person’s attitudes towards France you may ask: 
‘Would you go on holiday to France? Do you like French food? Do you have 
any French friends?’ By combining all these answers statistically, you can 
get an idea of someone’s overall attitude towards France. Or you can look 
at the aspects separately to see whether any interesting potential contradic­
tions exist; for example, perhaps people like the food in one country, but not 
the weather.

Lies, damned lies and questionnaires
The public usually think of questionnaires as a 
way to find out what people think. But clever 
and unscrupulous questioners can get the 
answers that they want to find all too easily. 
My favourite illustration comes from the UK TV 
show, Yes, Prime Minister. In one episode, two 
civil servants discuss the Prime Minister’s plan 
to reintroduce National Service, where young 
people work in the military for a year after leav­
ing school. The Prime Minister’s keen on the 
idea, his inexperienced civil servant Bernard 
Woolley says, because a survey revealed that 
the voters are in favour of it. Sir Humphrey 
replies that in that case they should just carry 
out another survey to show that the voters are 
against it ‒ and he shows Bernard how.
Humphrey:  You know what happens: nice 
young lady comes up to you. Obviously you 
want to create a good impression, you don’t 
want to look a fool, do you? So she starts 
asking you some questions: ‘Mr Woolley, are 
you worried about the number of young people 
without jobs?’

in crime among teenagers?’

琀
屴Humphrey: ‘Yes or no?’
琀
屴Bernard: ‘Yes’
琀
屴Humphrey: ‘Of course you would, Bernard. 
After all you told her you can’t say no to 
that. So they don’t mention the first five 
questions and they publish the last one.’
琀
屴Bernard: ‘Is that really what they do?’
琀
屴Humphrey: ‘Well, not the reputable ones 
no, but there aren’t many of those. So alter­
natively the young lady can get the oppo­
site result.’

These examples all use yes or no questions, but most questionnaires in social 
psychology use what’s called a Likert scale. These questions ask you to give a 
graded response along a labelled scale. For example, you may ask, ‘Do you like 
Marmite? Please answer from 1 to 7, where 1 means “not at all” and 7 means 
“very much”.’ These graded responses better reflect people’s mixed attitudes 
which – Marmite aside – are rarely polarised to black and white answers and 
are more often painted in shades of grey.
By asking a large number of these questions to a very large number of people 
and carrying out sophisticated statistical analysis methods, psychologists 
have an excellent way to measure and understand people’s attitudes. As the 
sidebar ‘Lies, damned lies and questionnaires’ reveals, however, things aren’t 
quite so simple.
Having an Attitude Problem
Social psychologists have an attitude problem! Perhaps I’d better rephrase 
that: they have a problem with attitudes. Although people have a strong 
sense of what their own attitudes are and social psychologists have a 
straightforward way to find out these attitudes using questionnaires (as I 
describe in the preceding section), that’s where the good news ends.
)>>
Social psychologists have two large issues with attitudes. Even when people 
tell you their attitudes towards something, these stated attitudes don’t neces­
sarily match up with much about the following two things:
)>>
✓)>>How they’re going to behave in the future.
)>>
✓)>>What they really think.
These problems are due to the fact that the attitudes that people convey to 
researchers can be heavily influenced. Exactly how the researcher asks the 
question can strongly determine the answer.
Read on to discover some surprising examples of how people can be influ­
enced when giving their attitudes (even completely contradicting themselves 
within the course of a single interview) as well as a few specific ways in 
which answers about attitudes can be biased.

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Examining the relationship between 
attitudes and behaviour
In this section, I consider the link between attitudes and behaviour and test 
the idea that attitudes are seen as things that cause behaviour.

Next to each question below put a number between 1 for ‘strongly disagree’ to 
5 for ‘strongly agree’:

✓)>>Engaging in regular physical exercise three times a week promotes good 
health.

✓)>>Eating a variety of foods each day, including five or more servings of 
fresh fruits and vegetables, contributes to wellness.

✓)>>It is essential that all citizens exercise their right to vote if government is 
to reflect effectively the will of the people.

✓)>>Homelessness is a serious social problem that needs attention.
What was your average response? For most people it’s around 4.

Now answer these questions, using the same 1 to 5 system:
)>>
✓)>>I take time to engage in regular physical exercise at least three times a week.
)>>
✓)>>I consistently eat at least five servings of fresh fruits and vegetables 
each day.
)>>
✓)>>I voted in the last election for which I was eligible.
)>>
✓)>>I’ve recently done something to address the problem of homelessness, 
such as making a contribution, talking with a homeless person or writing 
to my local politician.
What was your average this time? I guess it’s a lot closer to 1. At least, it is for 
most people. Why should this be?
The first set of questions asks about your attitudes towards certain issues 
and actions and the second set asks whether you carry out the actions that 
would reasonably follow from those attitudes. Almost everybody who does 
this test comes away feeling like a guilty hypocrite because people’s attitudes 
don’t seem to reflect their actions very well at all. For more background, read 
the nearby sidebar ‘Attitudes don’t always reflect actions’.

 Chapter 4: Appraising At⁜titudes: The Troublesome Atoms of Social Psychology
)>>
Common sense suggests that explicit attitudes should cause behaviours, but 
this isn’t happening. Why? The elegant and surprising answer is that common 
sense has things backwards. Social psychology shows that often it is behav­
iours that determine attitudes. I discuss this fascinating idea and the evidence 
behind it in Chapter 6. For now, you just need to take on board that asking 
people what they think about something is a surprisingly unhelpful way to pre­
dict how they’ll behave.
Feeling the force . . . to be consistent
I now want to consider the results of a study that shows that people appear 
to have a weak memory for the choices that they make, which is very inter­
esting from the point of view of a cognitive psychologist. But for the social 
psychologist, the experiment is a powerful demonstration of the power of 
consistency over explicit attitudes.
At⁜titudes don’t always reflect actions
The discovery that attitudes don’t always reflect 
actions came as a great surprise to early social 
psychologists. Richard LaPiere, a professor at 
Stanford University, gave a powerful demon­
stration of the disconnect between attitudes 
and behaviour in the 1930s. He travelled around 
the US with some colleagues from China. At the 
time, many people in the US held a strong nega­
tive stereotype about Chinese people. LaPiere 
wrote to motels and restaurants along the route, 
asking whether they’d accommodate him and 
his Chinese guests. Of the 128 who wrote back, 
92 per cent told him that they’d refuse to serve 
Chinese customers. A strong negative attitude 
indeed. But when he travelled round the coun­
try, visiting the same hotels and restaurants, the 
Chinese travellers were treated with courtesy 
in 249 out of 250 establishments, with only one 
turning them away. Remarkably, the powerful 
negative attitudes didn’t predict behaviour.
In 1969 the psychologist Allan Wicker carried 
out a survey of the research that had measured 
people’s attitudes towards something and then 
also measured their behaviour. The studies had 
asked people what they thought about church 
attendance and then measured how many 
times they went each week, and measured 
students’ attitudes towards cheating and then 
counted the number of times they cheated on 
tests. Across 42 such papers, Wicker found 
that the average correlation coefficient was 
around 0.15. If you don’t know statistics, trust 
me that this is remarkably low. In mathematical 
terms, it means that 2.25 per cent of the vari­
ance in a person’s behaviour on average can 
be attributed to his attitudes. In everyday terms, 
of all the factors that cause you to go to church, 
cheat on a test or be courteous to a customer of 
a certain race, only about 2 per cent of them are 
your explicit attitudes.

People are quite happy to endorse beliefs that aren’t their own and give elabo­
rate reasons for them, just so that answers appear consistent. (To see a pop-
culture example of how questioners influence answers, check out the earlier 
‘Lies, damned lies and questionnaires’ sidebar.)
Researchers Lars Hall and Petter Johannson interviewed people on the street 
about a range of political issues. The researchers gave participants a ques­
tionnaire that asked, for example, about greater controls on immigration. 
The person had to put a cross somewhere along a line between ‘strongly in 
favour’ and ‘strongly against’. After filling in the questionnaire, the respon­
dent handed it back to the researcher, who looked at it and asked some 
follow-up questions, such as, ‘I see you marked here in favour of immigration 
controls; can you tell me why?’ Then the person gave a series of reasons.
A standard political survey, you may think. But in the middle was a sleight of 
hand. While the participant was filling in the survey, the researcher was look­
ing over the participant’s shoulder and copying the answers onto another 
answer sheet. The researcher mimicked everything, even the person’s hand­
writing, but with one difference. On some questions, where the person put a 
cross on the ‘against’ end of the scale about immigration controls, for exam­
ple, the researcher reversed the response and put a cross on the ‘in favour’ 
end. When the person returned the answer sheet, the researcher stuck the 
new version on top of it and handed the sheet back.
One major surprise was that most people didn’t realise the deception at all. 
They didn’t notice that some of their answers had been reversed. Plus, many 
went on to give a set of entirely reasonably explanations for the political 
position that was the exact opposite of what they believed. So the person who 
first said that he was against greater controls on immigration, moments later 
saw his cross next to ‘in favour’, and rather than object that that wasn’t what 
he thought, he’d explain to the researcher that he was concerned that the 
healthcare system couldn’t cope with an increase in population, and that he 
was worried that new immigrants may take the jobs of local people.
)>>
The experiment shows the strong need that people have to appear consistent 
when they answer a researcher’s questions, even though they aren’t.
Looking good for the person with the 
clipboard: People want to be liked
The Hall and Johannson experiment in the preceding section suggests that 
people want to appear consistent in order to present themselves in a good 
light. People also use other ways to appear nice, too.

 Chapter 4: Appraising At⁜titudes: The Troublesome Atoms of Social Psychology
Imagine meeting someone at a party and introducing yourself. You may say 
something like: ‘I’m a student and I like live music.’ But you probably don’t 
start the conversation with: ‘I’m a racist and I really don’t like poor people.’
When you talk to people you meet, many factors influence the things you 
say to them. What you really think and feel is one factor, and the desire to 
look like a reasonable person is another: hence the desire to give consistent, 
coherent answers that make sense. Chapter 14 describes how researchers 
can use many of these factors in persuasion to influence actively your opin­
ions, but here I consider that these aspects can cause considerable problems 
if you want to find out what people really think. And if you want to predict 
how people will behave in the future, well, that’s an even bigger problem.
When people talk to people – even researchers – they want to give a good 
impression of themselves. We call this a self-presentation bias. Sometimes pre­
senting themselves well is more important for people than being accurate or 
honest with their answers. Historically, this self-presentation bias has caused 
problems for researchers.
Exit polls asking people to say how they just voted are performed by poll­
sters standing outside of voting stations on election day. In America, the 
companies performing these polls have noticed a strange quirk. When they 
compared the result of the polls to the true result of the election after all the 
votes were counted, they found that the polls consistently overestimated the 
votes for the Democratic Party. The difference was particularly noticeable 
in the 2004 election, which had a high turnout and was a very close race. 
It’s understandable that the exit polls would be inaccurate, as not everyone 
wants to say how they voted, but why would they consistently err in favour 
of the Democrats?
One clue that the pollsters found is that the discrepancy between the poll 
and the true results was greatest in the precincts where the exit poll person­
nel were female graduate students. Also, many of the people who talked to 
the pollsters were older and male. Separate studies showed that older males 
held the belief that young females were, on average, more likely to support 
the Democratic Party.
)>>
Generally speaking (as I discuss in Chapter 15) people like people who are 
similar to themselves. Therefore, researchers hypothesised (and later experi­
ments confirmed) that males are more likely to tell young female pollsters 
that they voted for the Democratic Party, in order to appear more likeable. Of 
course, not every male does so, but enough to skew the results of the exit poll. 
In addition, because the results of the exit polls were broadcast before the 
end of the voting, in such a tight race this bias may have even influenced the 
course of the election itself.

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
In some countries the use of exit poll data isn’t allowed, and many people 
recognise that these polls aren’t a very good way of judging who has won 
an election. They’re still used in the United States, though, mostly for two 
reasons:
)>>
✓)>>They provide useful objective facts, such as how many people voted, 
their ages and genders.
)>>
✓)>>They help talking heads fill up TV time while the newsrooms wait for the 
votes to be counted.
Even if you remove the biasing effects of a pretty, young pollster, surveys 
aren’t always more accurate than exit polls, because answers can be biased 
in more subtle ways as well, as my next example shows.
Researchers Ara Norenzayan and Norbert Schwarz sent out surveys to stu­
dents asking them to read a story about a mass murderer and answer ques­
tions about what drove him to commit his crimes. Each packet contained 
a letter on the first page from the researcher asking for the person’s help. 
Half of the letters had a heading stating that the researcher worked for the 
‘Institute of Personality Research’ and the other half had a heading reading 
‘Institute of Social Research’.
The heading was the only difference between these packets of survey mate­
rials. But the participants who answered questions from the Institute of 
Personality Research were about 10 per cent more likely than the others 
to say that the mass murderer’s actions were due to something about his 
personality; the participants answering questions from Institute of Social 
Research were about 20 per cent more likely than the others to say that his 
actions were due to some social factor, such as violence in the media, soci­
etal pressures or an unhappy upbringing.
)>>
These results are remarkable. The participants were giving thoughtful, consid­
ered answers to difficult questions. Yet their attitudes were swayed to a large 
degree by one line, one incidental detail, on one page of the survey.
Influencing with frames and anchors
The precise wording of a question can subtly determine its answer. I illus­
trate two such ways here: framing and anchoring effects. In each case, small 
changes to the language or the focus of the sentence can have surprisingly 
large effects on the answer.
www.it-ebooks.info

79
 Chapter 4: Appraising At⁜titudes: The Troublesome Atoms of Social Psychology
Anchoring
Here’s an example that you can try on your friends. Tell them, ‘When my 
cousin graduated a few years ago, his first salary was £20,000. What do you 
think yours may be?’ Figure out their average response. Now ask a separate 
set of friends this question: ‘When my cousin graduated a few years ago, his 
first salary was £40,000. What do you think yours may be?’ Now I have no 
idea what your friends are like or how much people typically earn coming out 
of college, but I bet you that the second group give a higher average answer.
)>>
This effect is called anchoring and adjustment: when you ask people a question, 
they tend to start off from a reference point (the anchor) and then give their 
responses as a little bit more or a little bit less (the adjustment). This adjust­
ment is rarely large enough to result in an accurate guess. In other words, 
people’s estimates are dragged towards the anchor.
Framing
The President of Earth turns to the hero and says, ‘Bruce/Arnie/Sylvester, 
there’s a one in ten chance that if you fly that nuclear missile straight into the 
aliens’ mothership, it’ll wipe them out completely and contain the blast so that 
Planet Earth is saved and everyone can live in peace and freedom. It’s so crazy, 
it may just work!’ At this point, most people cheer our hero on. But imagine 
that another voice pipes up, saying, ‘That means that there’s a 90 per cent 
chance that we’ll all die horribly. Either immediately from the nuclear blast or 
more slowly from a combination of the radiation sickness and retaliation from 
the aliens. Let’s just not bother.’ Now how do you feel about the plan?
)>>
This is an example of framing. The point is that the same choice can be framed 
in terms of a gain (10 per cent chance of success) or framed in terms of a loss 
(90 per cent chance of failure). Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have 
convincingly shown that people are very loss adverse. In other words, they’re 
more likely to make the decision if they think of the gains than if they think of 
the losses.
Such small changes in language can have a surprisingly large effect on answers. 
Elizabeth Loftus carried out a survey in which she asked people one of the two 
following questions:
Do you get headaches frequently, and if so, how often?
Or
Do you get headaches occasionally, and if so, how often?
www.it-ebooks.info

80
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
People who answered the first question said that they suffered headaches 
about every three days, on average. People who answered the second said 
every ten days. Everyone was answering the same question about a pretty 
unambiguous experience – how often they get headaches – but that small 
changes from frequently to occasionally increased their answers by a factor of 
three.
The problem concerns how people interpret the words that you use in your 
question. In one survey, 61 per cent of Americans said that they supported 
the government spending more on ‘assistance to the poor’. But when the 
same population was asked whether they supported spending more govern­
ment money on ‘welfare’, only 21 per cent were in favour. In other words, if 
you ask people about individual welfare programmes ‒ such as giving financial 
help to people who have long-term illnesses and paying for school meals for 
families with low income – people are broadly in favour of them. But if you ask 
about ‘welfare’ – which refers to those exact same programmes that you’ve 
just listed – they’re against it. The word ‘welfare’ has negative connotations, 
perhaps because of the way many politicians and newspapers portray it.
)>>
Therefore, the framing of a question can heavily influence the answer in many 
ways, which matters if your aim is to obtain a ‘true measure’ of what people 
think. (You can discover much more about these decision-making heuristics 
as they’re called by taking a class on cognitive psychology or reading one of 
Kahneman and Tversky’s books.) And next time you hear a politician say ‘sur­
veys prove that the majority of the people agree with me’, be very wary. If the 
questions were framed slightly differently, the minority of people would hold 
those views.
Phrasing matters
Of course, these problems (and opportunities!) 
are well known in political circles, even if they 
aren’t discussed in public. As well as electing 
officials, many countries now have referen­
dums during elections, in which the citizens 
give their opinion on a single issue, such as 
joining or leaving the European Union or allow­
ing gay marriage.
Politicians and campaigners spend a great deal 
of time and effort before the vote arguing over 
the precise language used in such referendum 
questions. Do you ask people whether they 
want closer European integration or if they 
want to handover their national government 
powers to the European government? These 
points may mean, practically, the exact same 
thing. But as you know, people can give very 
different answers. Often then, the real battle 
between campaigners isn’t over the hearts and 
minds of the people, but the words and phrasing 
of the question.

L

ike the cables, pipes and wires that connect the houses in your neigh­
bourhood, out of sight and underground, connections between your 
ideas, thoughts and feelings run beneath your everyday awareness. You may 
not realise these implicit attitudes exist in your mind, but nevertheless they 
have an influence over your behaviour.
For example, I doubt that you’ve ever had the conscious thought, ‘I don’t 
trust Londoners.’ If I ask you whether you think that living in one part of a 
particular country makes someone more trustworthy, you’d probably say 
not. But studies show that people in the UK tend to be suspicious of people 
with London accents, compared to people with accents from the north-east 
of England. Some banks noticed this tendency and located their call centres 
in Yorkshire, because customers phoning found the voices of the people they 
spoke to more trustworthy.
In this chapter I explore where these associations in your mind originate 
and how researchers can measure them in the laboratory. I show the pow­
erful effect that implicit attitudes can have on your behaviour, even when 
you’re not conscious of them at all. This reality raises the challenging 
question of what determines your social behaviour: your conscious or non-
conscious mind?

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Bringing Implicit Attitudes into the Light
In Chapter 4, I talk about explicit attitudes – those that you can think or say 
out loud: ‘I love sushi’, ‘I hate people who check Facebook on their phones 
while you’re talking to them’ or ‘The new Star Wars movies are a huge 
disappointment’.
)>>
Implicit attitudes, in contrast, are the unspoken evaluations and associations in 
your mind, including ones that you’re perhaps not even consciously aware of.
Here are just two examples of implicit attitudes that social psychologists 
have uncovered:
)>>
✓)>>People often connect the colour green with feelings of peace and red 
with feelings of anger and passion.
)>>
✓)>>People often expect Asian people to be good at maths and Black people 
to be good at sports.
In this section I investigate where these types of beliefs and prejudices come 
from, and reveal how they can be used to influence your behaviour.
Social psychologists are very interested in implicit attitudes and their effect 
on behaviour. As we saw in Chapter 4, gauging what people’s ‘true’ attitudes 
are by asking them explicitly is surprisingly hard. They give different answers 
at different times, to different people, and then seem to carry out the oppo­
site behaviour anyway. Implicit associations, however, can be measured 
by social psychologists without people being aware that their attitudes are 
being studied. So even attitudes that people don’t want to admit to publically, 
such as negative feelings about people of different races, can be studied. At 
least, that is the claim of some social psychologists. As I shall discuss, not all 
agree.
Meeting the masters: Advertisers
In case you’re wondering just how powerful implicit attitudes and associa­
tions are and whether you need to know more about them, I take a moment 
here to mention the real experts in the field.
Advertisers are extremely adept at exploiting the attitudes that people already 
hold. For example, consider the names of popular sleeping pills – Ambien, 
Lunesta, Sonata. Why do advertisers use these names rather than the chemical 
names, such as zolpidem tartrate? The reason lies in the sounds. The brand 
www.it-ebooks.info

83
 Chapter 5: Uncovering Implicit Attitudes and Associations
names sound familiar and soothing, the drug names jarring and alien. Similarly, 
they package energy drinks in silver with vivid reds and blues, and herbal teas 
in pastel pinks and yellows, because these colours evoke certain feelings in 
people of being stimulated or soothed.
As well as exploiting the existing associations in your mind, advertisers are 
also maestros at creating new connections. Flick through a magazine and 
see how many of the advertisements include a picture of an attractive young 
person who has nothing to do with the product. Is that woman draped over 
the bonnet of that sports car an example of the sort of person advertisers 
hope will buy the car? Was she placed there because she helped design the 
engine? Sadly not.
No one is stupid enough to think consciously, ‘If I buy that car women are 
going to flop themselves over it like towels on a sunbed’. Well, almost no one. 
The advertisers are using her to create an association between that car and 
feelings of attraction a male buyer may feel. So when the buyer thinks of that 
car, he feels part of that attraction again.

Advertising is a billion-pound industry for the simple reason that these 
implicit attitudes work.
Where did that come from? The origins 
of implicit attitudes
)>>
Brains are remarkably good at learning patterns and regularities in the world, 
known as associations. I talk more about implicit associations in the later sec­
tion ‘Making connections: Implicit associations’.
I think that the most impressive example of associative learning comes from 
developmental psychology. Babies can’t speak or fill in a questionnaire, but 
researchers can study them by looking at changes in their heart rate, how 
often they suck on a dummy and how they turn their heads and eyes towards 
some images and away from others. Remarkably, they found that new-born 
infants, as soon as they come out of the womb, can tell the difference between 
stories in their own language and stories read in a foreign tongue. They can 
even tell the difference between soap opera theme songs and other pieces of 
music. But how? Do they have language patterns and daytime music scores 
encoded into their DNA?
No: this ability is all down to the learning that takes place even before birth. 
In late pregnancy, the parents of these infants had taken to reading stories 
to their unborn children. Also, because they often can do little else at the 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
end of pregnancy, the mothers sat on their couches and watched TV. By late 
pregnancy the fetuses had developed sufficiently to hear sounds. You can’t 
hear very well in the womb (it sounds like you’re at the bottom of a swim­
ming pool), but you can hear something through the tissue and amniotic 
fluid. Fetuses are such incredibly advanced learning machines that they can 
acquire the rhythms and cadences of their native language, and even pick up 
on the theme songs of the soap operas.
After you’re born, through childhood and into adulthood, your brain con­
tinues to be a remarkable learning machine. As I discuss in the following 
section, like all humans you’re highly sensitive to the number of times you 
perceive people and objects, colours and sounds, and whether these things 
appear together or apart. And these experiences of the world, or the world 
seen through TV and films, create your implicit attitudes ‒ all without your 
conscious awareness.
)>>
Here’s a revealing exercise to examine your own implicit social concepts. Give 
it a try.
As quickly as you can, picture a scientist in your mind. Describe as much 
as you can of the person who immediately comes to mind. What does your 
scientist look like? I bet male, at least 30 years old, reasonably tall and thin, 
White or Asian, and perhaps wearing glasses.
Now, if I ask you explicit questions – ‘Are scientists male? Do scientists have 
poor eyesight?’ – you’d probably say, ‘It depends’ or ‘I have no idea’. You may 
be a budding female scientist yourself or an ardent feminist. But the chances 
are that you still described a man in this exercise.
No matter what your political or feminist beliefs – that is, your explicit 
attitudes – you watch the same TV shows, read the same books and watch 
the same films.

Your personal values don’t create your implicit attitudes; what does is expo­
sure to the world and the culture around you.
Recognising the powerful force 
of mere exposure
The mere exposure effect is like gravity. It is all around you, all the time, 
gently influencing your behaviour. In fact, like gravity, the exposure effect’s 
so pervasive that forgetting about it is easy. In fact, it is a powerful force that 
shapes your likes and dislikes, what you buy and what you listen to, and it 
may have even had a hand in where you live and what you do for a living.

If you’re from Kazakhstan, or speak Kazakh, I’m afraid that this demonstration 
won’t work for you. But otherwise, have a go and test your intuitions about 
the language.
Here are two Kazakh words: tzikagt and solmin. One means loving or devoted 
and the other means noxious or repellent. Can you guess which is which?
If you’re like the participants in social psychologist Bob Zajonc’s experi­
ments, you guessed that tzikagt is the negative word and solmin is the pleas­
ant word. Why is this? In fact, in Zajonc’s experiment and my example, the 
words are made up – they have nothing to do with any real languages (apolo­
gies to Kazakh speakers). How can you have opinions about words that are 
entirely made up?
Well, the first word looks less familiar to English speakers. It uses relatively 
uncommon letters and strings them together in unusual ways. The letters tz 
only appear in a few rare words (like blitz). In contrast, solmin has clusters 
of words more familiar to English speakers. You see the words some and 
soap much more frequently. In fact, out of a million words that you may read, 
about 11,000 are likely to have the letters so in them somewhere, and only 
six have tz. Your positive feelings for solmin are caused by the familiarity of 
those letters and sounds. Tzikagt sounded like a negative word to you just 
because it’s unfamiliar.
)>>
Zajonc called this phenomenon the mere exposure effect. In general, the more 
you perceive something, the more familiar it is and the more you like it. This 
reality has been demonstrated in many ways, and it has little to do with con­
scious awareness.
In another of Zajonc’s experiment, participants were given a choice of several 
polygons (straight-sided shapes such as pentagons and hexagons) and asked 
to choose which they preferred. Most felt as if they were picking at random, 
but in fact one of the polygons had been presented to them in among other 
stimuli in a previous experiment they’d just completed. The shape was pre­
sented very quickly and immediately followed by another image. The partici­
pants had no conscious awareness of the shape at all. Despite this, they were 
far more likely to say that they preferred that particular shape when later 
given a choice.
The mere exposure effect explains why Nike, Coke and other companies 
spend millions getting their logo in front of people’s eyes many times a day, 
on posters, buses, products, celebrities and even placed into films. And it 
also explains why the villains in English-speaking movies are more likely to 
have names with the letters z, k and v.

What letters do you like? Imagine that you’re playing roulette, but the wheel 
contains letters instead of numbers. Write down one or two letters that you’d 
put your money on. Why do you think you chose them?
Do you feel lucky, punk? The reality 
of implicit egoism
You may have a very high opinion of yourself, or you may be feeling a bit 
down. But regardless of your explicit feelings about your ego, a surprising 
application of the mere exposure effect is to boost your implicit egoism. 
Things that are associated with you are very familiar to you, and that famil­
iarity increases your liking. The implicit egoism effect is important because it 
pervades many of your decisions in life.
For example, you see one thing very often in your life that’s particular to you: 
your name. You write it down and read it many times a day. You hear people 
say it to you all the time. So when you ask people to say which letter they 
prefer, the chances are that they pick the first letter of their first or their last 
names (or sometimes a nickname). If you ask them why, they probably don’t 
know and may feel a bit embarrassed if you point it out.
)>>
The name of this effect is implicit egoism, and it extends far beyond which let­
ters you think are lucky.
In a large analysis of US census data, researchers found that names were 
related, at levels above mere chance, to occupations and locations. In other 
words, if you look at all the dentists in the US, they’re more likely to be called 
Dennis than other occupations. If you look at all the people called Louise, 
they’re more likely to live in Louisiana than people with other names. Of 
course, not every lawyer is called Larry and lives in LA. The effects are small 
fractions-of-a-percent differences, but they are significant.
The appliance of Zajonc
Bob Zajonc is a big name in social psychol­
ogy, and also the most mispronounced (the last 
name, that is, not ‘Bob’!). You say it like ‘sci­
ence’ but with a ‘z’ sound at the start.
The pronunciation isn’t ‘za-jonk’, as I once said 
in an elevator . . . when the man himself was 
standing right behind me!

Just for fun, next time you’re in a large group of people, ask about the names 
and jobs of everyone’s parents. You have a good chance of hearing about 
some journalists called Jenny and some nurses called Nick (but, of course, you 
have to work out the probability of getting these matches by coincidence).
The data get even more surprising. In a study of school grades, researchers 
found that among the students getting A grades, more were named Alan and 
Alice than you’d expect, on average. Plus, more Betty and Bobs got Bs.
Of course, your grades in life aren’t something you chose, like your favourite 
letters or your job. The claim is that if you are called Alan, you simply like the 
letter a slightly more than if you are called Frank. And so you value getting 
an A grade on your school work a little bit more. You work harder to get the 
grade, and end up with more As in your school record.
Of course, perhaps there are other explanations for these results. Maybe, 
for some reason, parents who chose the names beginning with the letter a 
put more academic pressure on their children. But experimental evidence 
does exist for implicit egoism being the cause of this effect. Researchers gave 
people a test and offered a prize if they did well. They gave the prize different 
names in different experimental conditions and found that people worked 
harder to win if the prize had the same first letter as their names. So it’s 
not something special about Alans and Abigails: everyone works a little bit 
harder to win prizes that have the same first letter as their name.
So if Charlie’s getting too many C grades for him to achieve his dream of 
becoming a chiropractor, try offering to buy him some cheese if he gets the 
top marks!
Making connections: Implicit associations
The mere exposure effect and implicit egoism from the preceding two sec­
tions show that the more you perceive a particular thing, the more positively 
you view it; that’s one sort of implicit attitude. But here I want to discuss 
another type: implicit associations. These are connections between two con­
cepts or things.
)>>
Whenever you perceive two things at the same time, or in a way that connects 
them, you discover an association between them. Like the frequency of things 
in your world, you can learn associations without awareness, by absorbing the 
patterns in the world around you.
You have many such associations that you probably aren’t aware of. For 
example, visualise a singing bird. Is it smaller or bigger than a pigeon?
www.it-ebooks.info

88
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
I bet that you said smaller. That’s because you’ve implicitly learnt a pattern 
about the world: that most singing birds are small. Unless you’re an ornithol­
ogist, this probably wasn’t explicit knowledge that you possessed. You didn’t 
know that you knew it; but you had the association.
People have all sorts of implicit associations about other people. Some are 
based on true patterns that exist in the world – that men are on average 
taller than women, for example. But many are based not on what you directly 
observe, but how people are described in conversation or portrayed in the 
media. In Chapter 3, for example, I discuss the stereotype that heterosexual 
men have more sexual partners than heterosexual women even though it 
can’t be true logically speaking. Nevertheless, you most likely discovered 
this implicit association from the way that people talk about themselves and 
others.
Flip to Chapter 10 for more about stereotypes, the way you build up beliefs 
about certain groups of people and how you – often falsely – apply that 
knowledge to others.
Measuring Implicit Attitudes
If you run an advertising company, then you can see implicit attitudes at work 
by putting up billboards, running TV ads and inserting your products into TV 
shows and movies. Soon you would see that implicit attitudes can be created 
and manipulated. But social scientists don’t want to just create new implicit 
attitudes in people, they also want to study what implicit attitudes already 
exist in people. In this section I discuss how experts measure those implicit 
attitudes, what they reveal about explicit attitudes and how they relate to 
human behaviour. You may well have guessed pretty quickly a central prob­
lem here: how can you probe the implicit associations in someone’s mind if 
you can’t directly ask that person (people are often unaware of their implicit 
attitudes)? Well, you turn to cognitive psychology, which has a well-developed 
toolkit for investigating thoughts and concepts. Cognitive psychologists 
have studied associative learning in order to understand, for example, how 
memory organises information and how babies learn categories of objects.
)>>
The brain doesn’t store information in little individual packets, like books on a 
shelf or the files in your computer. Instead, it does so in a web of associations 
and connections. When you think of one thing (say, a family car), you’re in 
effect picking up one part of that web and all the associated ideas and memo­
ries get pulled up a little bit too.

 Chapter 5: Uncovering Implicit Attitudes and Associations
Scientists use this feature of the brain to study implicit attitudes. In this sec­
tion I discuss how priming experiments are a way to measure the association 
between two ideas in terms of reaction times (I describe the origins of prim­
ing in Chapter 5). In priming, you assume that differences in reaction times 
are related to differences in the way that concepts are associated in the mind. 
The concept of priming is central to many experiments in social cognition. It 
works because the brain stores associations between ideas and information. 
When you activate one idea in the brain you also partially activate, or prime, 
all associated ideas. By activate, I just mean bring to mind in some way. For 
more on priming, read the nearby sidebar ‘Priming experiments’.
Investigating automatic activation 
of behaviour
The brain doesn’t just store disembodied concepts like a dictionary; it also 
stores actions, feelings, gestures and emotions. Social psychologists such as 
John Bargh have shown that these aspects can be primed and that they can 
directly influence behaviour without you being consciously aware of it.
Priming experiments
The most common way to activate an idea in an 
experiment is to show someone a word or pic­
ture. So scientists may flash the word NURSE 
on the screen. This primes all the concepts that 
your brain associates with nurses, such as hos­
pital, pill, injection, as well as specific memories 
you have about nurses that you’ve met.
Scientists reveal that this priming has taken 
place with cognitive psychology’s favourite 
tool: reaction times. In a priming experiment 
the participant may be given the job of decid­
ing whether a word onscreen is a proper 
English word (such as TRUCK) or a nonsense 
word (like DRUCK). The nonsense words don’t 
matter – their role is just to give the participants 
a task to do in the experiment. Just before the 
person sees the word, she hears another word 
spoken in her ear. If she hears the real word 
NURSE first she’s faster in responding to the 
word DOCTOR immediately afterwards. This is 
because NURSE partially activates the concept 
DOCTOR, and so part of the job of activating that 
word in the brain has already been done.
The experimental result that NURSE primes 
DOCTOR (but not TRUCK or SAUSAGE) is a 
scientific demonstration that, in the mind of 
that participant, those two concepts are linked. 
Now you can probably see how experts can 
use this tool to investigate issues in social 
psychology. For example, if NURSE also primes 
the word WOMAN in the minds of some people, 
then this is evidence that they have a gender-
stereotyped view of nurses as female.

Imagine yourself sitting in a cubicle with a computer. It flashes up pictures of 
yellow blocks on screen and you have to type in the number of blocks that 
you see each time. You see hundreds of sets of yellow blocks. You’ve been 
doing this experiment for almost an hour, and your fingers are aching. Then 
the computer flashes up the words ‘Error saving data. Please start the experi­
ment again.’ How would you feel at that point?
In that original experiment, a small camera recorded participants’ reactions 
at the moment they were told that all their work had been lost. The research­
ers coded how aggressive and angry people appeared. Whether they frowned 
or cursed, for example.
The participants had been placed in two different conditions, and in one 
condition the levels of anger and aggression displayed by participants were 
much higher. The difference between the conditions was very subtle. In 
fact, the participants weren’t even aware of it. In between each set of yellow 
blocks, a face flashed up on screen. The face appeared very quickly and 
was immediately replaced with the next image, and so the participants were 
unaware that they had seen anything. (This technique is called subliminal 
presentation.) Even though they weren’t consciously aware of any faces at all, 
something about those faces changed their behaviour in one condition.
Half of the White participants in this study were subliminally presented with 
faces of White males and the other half with Black males. Those who’d seen 
Black faces displayed more anger and aggression when they found out that 
their work had been lost.
The subliminal presentation of their faces was enough to prime the stereo­
type of Black Americans in these American participants. Part of their stereo­
type was the idea that Black Americans are more aggressive and angry. So 
perception of the faces partially activated feelings of anger, which spilled out 
into actual aggression when the participants were given bad news.
)>>
Priming experiments are a very useful tool for studying the perceptual, social 
and behavioural contents of a stereotype and the way in which it’s activated. 
For example, American participants were given lots of works on tiles that they 
had to rearrange into a sentence. Those participants whose puzzle included 
words like Florida and grey were primed with the stereotype of old people, 
and this caused them to walk more slowly out of the laboratory after they’d 
finished the puzzle. I describe more such examples throughout this book. For 
now I want to focus on another tool to measure implicit attitudes in the next 
section.

 Chapter 5: Uncovering Implicit Attitudes and Associations
Trying out the Implicit Association 
Test (IAT)
The IAT is an experiment that can measure how two pairs of concepts are 
related. For example, it can tell you how much someone associates positive 
qualities with White faces and negative qualities with Black; or whether the 
sciences are seen as a male activity and humanities as female.
How the test works
The logic of the IAT is quite straightforward. The participants are given the 
job of categorising two different things into two different groups by pressing 
two different buttons. They repeat this process many times, and each time 
they can be categorising either sort of thing, because they appear at random.
For example, they have to categorise a person’s name as male or female and 
college subjects as being in the sciences or the humanities. So onscreen they 
see Janice and they press the button for female, and then they see Geology 
and they press the button for science, and then David, Claire, History, Physics 
and so on.
)>>
Here are two crucial aspects of the experiment:
)>>
✓)>>Participants only have two buttons to use in their categorisation task.
)>>
✓)>>Researchers swap round which button is assigned to which category.
Probing your own prejudices
You can try out the IAT for yourself at 
https://implicit.harvard.edu, 
where researchers at Harvard University have 
put the experiment online for people to try. Over 
a million people have performed the experiment 
across the world, making it one of the largest 
psychology experiments ever performed.
Visit the website and choose your country from 
the list on the left. You can then use the IAT to 
measure the implicit prejudice that you hold for 
groups based on race, gender, body weight and 
sexual orientation.
When my wife did the IAT, the website told her 
that like most people, she associates women 
with humanities and men with sciences. Even 
though she herself is a science professor 
and her father was a humanities professor! 
Perhaps, regardless of her explicit attitudes 
and her career choice, somewhere in her 
mind she still harbours the implicit attitude 
that science is a man’s job. Interesting, I think 
you’ll agree.
www.it-ebooks.info

92
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
So the first time a participant does the task, she may press the button D to 
categorise names as female and subjects as humanities. She presses button K 
for male names and science subjects. But then she’s asked to do the task again, 
this time categorising female names and science subjects with button D and 
males and humanities with K. The button that participants press may seem like 
an arbitrary and unimportant aspect of the experiment, but some researchers 
argue that it can reveal participants’ implicit attitudes.
Conclusions
Participants respond more quickly when they have to press the same button 
for things that they associate with each other. In this example, most people 
would be faster to respond when categorising female names and humani­
ties subjects with one button and male names and sciences with the other. 
They’d be comparatively slower on the second attempt when categorising 
female names and sciences with one button and male names and humanities 
with the other.
IAT researchers look at the average reaction times with one arrangement of 
the buttons and subtract it from the reaction times with the other arrange­
ment. This number, they claim, indicates the degree to which a participant 
associates particular pairs of concepts together.
Many IAT experiments have probed racial attitudes. Participants are asked 
to categorise faces as Black or White, for example, and also to categorise 
words as positive (cake, puppies, cuddle) or negative (murder, famine, pain). 
As I discuss in Chapter 4, in a questionnaire study people are very unlikely 
to endorse explicitly racist attitudes, because of the social stigma against 
blatant racism. But even participants who show no signs of racism when 
asked explicitly, still appear to associate Black faces with negative things 
and White faces with positive things. In general this happens if the American 
participants themselves are White or if they are Black, since, the researchers 
claim, both groups grew up in the same country, and so have learnt the same 
implicit attitudes.
Some evidence suggests that IAT scores predict behaviour better than explicit 
measures. One study in the US looked at nurses working in an emergency 
room. They had the very difficult job of deciding patient priority ‒ whether 
patients were high priority for the doctor, because they were bleeding or 
unable to breathe, or were a low priority, because they had ‘just’ broken 
a limb or had a virus. None of the nurses held explicitly racist attitudes. 
Yet researchers found that the size of the reaction time difference in their 
IAT predicted a tendency for the nurses to move Black patients to the low 
priority list.

93
 Chapter 5: Uncovering Implicit Attitudes and Associations
Investigating the IAT’s results
Some researchers doubt the strength of these findings. The ability of the IAT 
to predict behaviour in the real world is heatedly discussed. But here’s a 
deeper question – what exactly is the IAT measuring?
I think of myself as a generally non-prejudiced person. I support equality in 
marriage rights, for pay and opportunity. I’ve been involved in campaigns 
against the gender-typing of children’s toys. I know I have some prejudices: 
for some reason, I can’t stand golf – people who play it, people who watch it – 
I just get angry thinking about it. But in general I try to be open-minded.
Yet the IAT suggests that I hold negative attitudes towards people of different 
racial groups, that I associate women with staying at home and looking after 
children, and that I have many other views that I argue explicitly against. 
Have I been lying to myself all this time that I’m a non-prejudiced person?
If you took the IAT test yourself, you may have had the same shock. This 
raises the question – is the IAT really measuring my and your attitudes?
Researchers answer this question in two ways. As you can see, these answers 
disagree with each other (the debate continues in conferences and journal 
papers today):
)>>
✓)>>Answer 1: The IAT gives a direct measure of your implicit attitudes. 
It reflects your true feelings towards different groups of people; feel­
ings that wouldn’t show up in a questionnaire about your attitudes. In 
everyday life you may try to cover up these negative evaluations out of 
politeness or because you don’t want to appear prejudiced. Or you may 
realise that you have negative views towards, say, gay people, and you’re 
making a sincere attempt to compensate for those views. Regardless 
of your motivation for behaving without prejudice in public, your real 
implicit prejudices exist, lurking beneath the surface. And the IAT can 
see them.
)>>
✓)>>Answer 2: The conclusion of Answer 1 misses an important distinction. 
A crucial difference exists between the prejudiced views that someone 
may or may not consciously hold and that person’s knowledge of specific 
stereotypes and prejudices in society.
琀
屴For example, I’m an English male. I don’t think I have any particular 
prejudice for or against such people. I’ve known good ones and bad 
ones. But after living in America for a long time, I have a very good sense 
of the stereotypes and implicit attitudes that Americans associate with 
English males: they’re effeminate, intellectual, pretentious and snobbish. 
www.it-ebooks.info

94
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
They talk about fair play but are morally suspect. They have bad teeth 
and yet are inexplicably attractive to some women. They play cricket, 
drink tea and love the Queen.
琀
屴Now imagine I took an IAT probing my implicit associations to English 
people. It may well find that I associate English people with cricket, tea 
and intellectuals. But this is just a reflection of my knowledge of the 
stereotype – not the fact that I genuinely hold those prejudiced beliefs 
myself.
琀
屴Similarly, if you take the IAT and it shows that you have negative asso­
ciations towards gay people, perhaps that’s simply reflecting your 
knowledge of the cultural stereotype. You’ve taken on board that one 
stereotype of gay people is that they’re bad at sports, effeminate and 
flamboyant. You may have discovered that this stereotype exists by 
observing how people are teased in school or from watching how gay 
people are portrayed on TV and in films.
琀
屴You’d have to be spectacularly unperceptive to live in society and not 
be aware of the stereotypes that are attached to gay people, women or 
Muslims. And that knowledge of stereotypes in society is what shows up 
in the IAT test. Not necessarily your own implicit attitudes, and certainly 
not your hidden explicit attitudes.
Discovering how explicit and implicit 
attitudes interact
The two views in the preceding section seem diametrically opposed, but in 
a sense they’re both true. To explain how, I look at one other experiment in 
this section. This one is particularly clever because it measures explicit and 
implicit attitudes at the same time.
In one experiment, participants were given an item and then asked to click 
one of two buttons with their mouse pointer: like or dislike. The items were 
things such as cake and holiday, for which most clicked like; or cancer and 
headache, for which they clicked dislike. The researchers were especially 
interested in one item in particular, the concept black people. The partici­
pants, who were White American students, all clicked like. But on the way 
to clicking the like button, the participants’ mouse pointer swerved ever so 
slightly towards dislike.
If you were watching the mouse pointer, you may not even notice anything 
different. But the researchers carefully analysed the trajectories of the point­
ers and found a systematic deviation towards the dislike button when partici­
pants were explicitly declaring that they liked Black people.
www.it-ebooks.info

95
 Chapter 5: Uncovering Implicit Attitudes and Associations
This result is a wonderful demonstration of the causal complexity of beliefs 
and behaviour. People’s actions – even simple ones like clicking a mouse – 
are the outcome of many influences that compete and interact. Participants’ 
responses in this experiment were dominated by their explicit attitude that 
they liked Black people. But in the moment that they made that decision, 
they also activated their knowledge of all the negative associations that 
American society has towards Black people.
The experiment shows that you can’t draw a clear line between the explicit 
attitudes that you consciously hold and the implicit associations that you 
happen to absorb from the world. You can’t fully separate these attitudes 
because both can have an influence on behaviour.
For example, a male manager may sincerely believe that men and women are 
equally capable for a research job he’s advertised. But what if he has a stack 
of 100 applications to get through very quickly? That slight difficulty he has 
pairing females with science – that slower reaction time that shows up in the 
IAT – may be enough that a few women who were borderline cases end up on 
the reject pile instead.
Or imagine that you’re in an elevator and someone calls for you to hold the 
door. As you reach out, you notice that the person’s Black. Those slight nega­
tive associations – that drag the mouse pointer towards the dislike button – 
may be enough to slow you down a little so that you don’t quite hit the button 
in time.
)>>
My point is that implicit associations may not reflect your own views, but 
simply those you’ve absorbed from the world around you. They may only 
have a small effect on your behaviour. But the consequences of that behaviour 
can be massive for the person who doesn’t get the job interview, who sees the 
elevator doors close and who goes on the low priority list at the emergency 
room.
Therefore, you have to be very careful, I think, with the way that different 
social groups are portrayed in the media. Some people say that the stupidest 
character on a TV show always being a blonde female is okay, as is the fact 
that Muslim characters always turn out to be terrorists. It’s fine, the argu­
ment goes, because everyone knows explicitly that not all blondes are dumb 
and that not all Muslims are evil. But I argue that if all these associations are 
repeatedly seen on TV, they seep into people’s memories and are perpetu­
ated in society.
This situation isn’t a case of ‘political correctness gone mad’; it’s a scientific 
understanding of how memory and implicit attitudes work.

Behaviour and Attitudes
In This Chapter

▶)>>Comparing competing theories
H

ere are two views on the connection between attitudes and behaviour, 
from two giants of US history. John Adams was one of the founding 
fathers of the United States and a leader of the revolutionary war against 
Great Britain. In a letter he wrote:
The Revolution was effected before the War commenced. The Revolution 
was in the minds and hearts of the people . . . . This radical change in the 
principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people, was the real 
American Revolution.
Adams is expressing a powerful idea here: that great action requires a change 
in the hearts and minds of people; that attitudes and beliefs are the cause of 
behaviour.
But here’s another view from Abraham Lincoln, who realised that sometimes 
the opposite is true: people’s behaviour can cause a change in their attitudes. 
Lincoln knew that another politician, whose support he needed, disliked him 
immensely. Lincoln did a clever thing to change this attitude. He found out 
that the politician was a collector of rare books. He wrote to him, asking to 
borrow one of his most prized specimens. The politician grudgingly agreed, 
not wishing to turn down a request from the president. After loaning him the 
book, however, the politician became friendlier towards Lincoln, and in time 
offered him his support.
www.it-ebooks.info

98
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Why did the politician change his attitude? Well, you don’t loan your most 
valuable possession to a man you dislike. After the politician carried out the 
behaviour of loaning his book to the president, it caused a shift in his attitude 
towards liking Lincoln.
In this chapter I weigh these two views of attitudes and behaviour against 
each other. Amazingly, the scientific evidence stacks up in favour of Lincoln’s 
view. In lots of everyday situations – how you feel about your job, your part­
ner or your children – your behaviour causes your attitudes. I will review the 
two powerful ideas, cognitive dissonance and self-perception theory, that 
explain how and why this happens.
Dealing with Conflicting Ideas: 
Cognitive Dissonance
No one likes a hypocrite; someone who says one thing and does another. The 
politicians who cut people’s benefits, yet take thousands in fake expenses 
claims; the religious leaders who talk about the sanctity of family life and 
have affairs behind closed doors: these people are the lowest of the low in 
public opinion. Just as we find hypocrisy and inconsistency intolerable in 
other people, we struggle with the feeling in ourselves too.
Forcing the issue: Behaviour shifts and civil rights
Some historians argue that Lincoln’s view was 
proved right by a later revolution in America – 
the civil rights movement. In the 1950s in the 
South, attitudes were very negative towards 
racial integration. It seemed as though the 
White population would never accept equal­
ity with Blacks. However, civil rights activists 
and politicians pushed through laws outlaw­
ing desegregation. Separate water fountains, 
buses and schools for whites and blacks were 
made illegal. This was not a revolution of hearts 
and minds, as Adams had described: this was a 
revolution pushed through by law against what 
many saw as the will of the southern people. 
Yet nevertheless, when made to desegregate, 
after people were made to behave in favour of 
equality, a slow, but seismic, shift in attitudes 
occurred. The White Americans started to feel 
more favourable towards the Blacks. Of course, 
it was not the end of the struggle by any means, 
but some historians argue that the biggest shift 
in people’s attitudes in the South was produced 
by this forced change in behaviour.

 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
)>>
This feeling is called cognitive dissonance: the state of holding a set of ideas or 
acting in ways that conflict with each other.
Social psychologists have found that people go to great lengths to reduce 
their cognitive dissonance. They create new beliefs or behave in new ways to 
reduce that dissonance, even when this behaviour seems plain irrational to 
other people. So those politicians who are cheating on their expenses claims 
­probably have convinced themselves that they are saving the taxpayer money. 
The religious leader having an affair may think that it is all a test from God to 
prove the purity of his faith.
Here’s another simple example. Say that I believe that I’m a decent and kind 
person. I believe that people should care for each other and that everyone 
has a right to basic human dignity. But tonight, I walk past a homeless person 
who’s obviously in distress and don’t stop to help. My actions don’t match 
my beliefs, a situation that produces cognitive dissonance within me.
How can I reduce this dissonance? Well, what if I think that the homeless 
person brought this situation on himself? Perhaps he was drunk, had taken 
drugs or was in the country illegally. If he’s broken the law, he doesn’t 
deserve my help.
)>>
By creating the belief that the homeless person is undeserving in some way, I 
reduce my cognitive dissonance. The point isn’t whether the belief is true or 
not, because I didn’t create it to have an accurate view of the world; I invent it 
to reduce my dissonance.
The term cognitive dissonance was invented by social psychologist Leon 
Festinger, who was fascinated by the interaction of behaviour and attitudes. 
He realised not only that attitudes are a weak cause of behaviour, but also 
that in some cases behaviour create attitudes.
Festinger observed that when an individual’s beliefs and behaviour contra­
dict each other, the result is cognitive dissonance. He theorised that human 
beings have a basic need to reduce cognitive dissonance whenever they can, 
because it’s such an uncomfortable state of mind. Thus, often people reduce 
the dissonance by creating a new belief or rejecting an old one.
Experiencing cognitive dissonance
Leon Festinger’s curiosity about behaviour and attitudes began with his 
study of doomsday cults, described in his book When Prophecy Fails. It’s 
worth understanding what he discovered in his study of cults. After seeing 
such counterintuitive and surprising behaviour in cult followers, Festinger 
www.it-ebooks.info

100
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
performed a series of experiments observing the same behaviour in every­
day people. His work is a wonderful example of the interplay between obser­
vation of people in the world and careful experimentation in the laboratory. 
As we shall see in this section, even if you haven’t been in a religious cult, I 
bet that you have responded to the power of cognitive dissonance too.
)>>
Imagine that you’ve joined a cult. You don’t, of course, sign up to join a cult 
in the first place. Everything begins quite differently. Your life isn’t going very 
well, and you meet some people who seem kind and interested in you; you 
turn up to some of their gatherings. After the barbecue (of meatless burgers 
and vegetable kebabs) they start talking about how their lives were turned 
round by joining this group, and how happy they are. They talk about a char­
ismatic leader and promise that next week you can meet him and take lessons 
with the group, if you want.
Soon, you’re attending regular classes with the leader. They cost a fair bit of 
money, but you have enough in the bank and decide to reduce your outgoings 
by moving in to a large house on the edge of town with other group members. 
The leader has a magnetic personality and in private tells you that he sees great 
things in you. The classes are going well, and you’re discovering that many 
things you thought were true are just lies you were told growing up. You realise 
that the things you cared about – money, property, family – are an illusion. With 
great relief you allow the group to look after your bank account and to answer 
the letters from your parents.
Now the leader gathers a select few followers into his room for a special revela­
tion. He tells you that he’s a reincarnation of a powerful god. He’s had a vision 
that the world will end next Monday at midnight. He appeals for your help in 
preparing the rest of the group for life in the next world. Together you burn the 
last of your property, the mementos of your past life. You all gather on a hilltop 
Monday night. You’ve given everything to be here with your leader. You sing 
exuberant songs of praise and pass around a special cleansing drink to prepare 
you for the end. You fall asleep knowing that tonight is your last on earth.
Then Tuesday morning arrives. You’re in a field surrounded by confused, 
muddy people. The leader has disappeared . . . but not to the afterlife; his 
truck is missing too, along with most of the money collected by the group.
Try to imagine how you feel. Do you still believe the strange, outlandish 
things that your leader taught you?
What fascinated Festinger was not only that many of the followers in such sit­
uations continued to believe, but also that they often believed even more in 
the cult leaders. Here’s his theory on why. Your beloved leader’s predictions 
have spectacularly failed to materialise and you and the others have severe

 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
cognitive dissonance. All your beliefs in the leader’s teaching are entirely at 
odds with the continued existence of the planet. What can you do? You have 
two basic options:
)>>
✓)>>To jettison all your beliefs about the cult, admit that you were wrong to 
believe and acknowledge that you’ve been duped. That would require 
you to reverse a lot of passionately held beliefs.
)>>
✓)>>To assume that you were right to believe and that the leader was correct 
in his teaching. The only thing he got wrong was the tiny detail of the 
exact day of the end of the world.
History has many examples of people rejecting the first option and, as crazy 
as it seems to other people, taking the second. It’s happened many times 
with the followers of doomsday cults. The day after the end of the world, the 
believers rationalise or explain away the fact that they’re still alive in a way 
that strengthens their beliefs.
This reaction is, of course, nonsensical. If a weather forecaster doesn’t see a 
hurricane coming, or if an economist doesn’t predict a stock-market crash, 
you’d stop listening to them. But if an admired leader makes the most dra­
matic prediction imaginable (the end of the world itself) and gets it wrong, 
history shows that faith in that religious leader grows.
‘That is illogical, Captain’
In one of the cults that Festinger studied, the 
members decided that God had rewarded their 
faith by deciding, at the last moment, not to 
destroy the world. This rationalisation served 
to confirm their beliefs, so resolving their cog­
nitive dissonance.
This reasoning is remarkably circular: the failure 
of the world to end is taken as evidence in favour 
of the belief system that predicted (wrongly) that 
the world would end! Such tortuous logic is com­
monplace in the face of cognitive dissonance.
Many cults today actively exploit these psy­
chological mechanisms. To their initiated fol­
lowers, they promote what seem like bizarre, 
science-fiction-like beliefs. But they don’t do 
so to begin with. The first things that you’re told 
when joining meetings are often innocuous, 
life-affirming messages. Only when people start 
paying for more and more classes, or commit 
their resources to the cult, are the more extreme 
aspects revealed: that the leader is a reincar­
nation of Jesus, that the world is run by lizard 
people or that all humans are aliens inhabiting 
human bodies.
By this point, the followers have sacrificed a 
lot to be members of the cult: perhaps they’ve 
given over all their money or lost contact with 
their families. Their behaviour has put the 
threat of cognitive dissonance at its height, and 
so their attitudes adapt to avoid it. This means 
believing all the teachings of the cult, no matter 
how ludicrous. Perversely, the very strange­
ness of these beliefs makes the committed fol­
lowers even more likely to believe them.

Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
Usually, the cult followers explain away the failure of the world to end in vari­
ous ways. (Perhaps God changed his mind or the leader made a minor error 
in interpreting the dates of the Mayan calendar.) But in these cases, the fail­
ures of prophecy lead to an increase in faith.
Considering the consequences 
of insufficient justification
To test his theories on cognitive dissonance, Festinger placed participants in 
a situation where they found themselves doing something unpleasant – lying 
to a stranger. He termed this induced compliance. He wanted to know the 
consequences of this action – how did carrying out this behaviour influence 
participants’ attitudes?
In the experiment, a person was first given a painfully tedious task. She 
was shown a chessboard of square wooden pegs and asked to rotate them 
each by 90 degrees in turn. Then she started again, turning each another 
90 degrees. Then, thankfully for the participant, the ‘experiment’ finished.
But in fact the interesting behaviour was to come. While getting ready to leave, 
a researcher approached the participant and asked for a favour. They were 
short-staffed, the researcher apologised, and asked the participant if she’d mind 
helping out for a moment. The participant agreed, and was asked to speak to 
the next person who was about to take part in the experiment. The researcher 
asked the participant if she’d tell the next person that the experiment was really 
interesting and enjoyable, which was clearly a lie. For her trouble, the partici­
pant was given $1 or $20 as payment (the two experimental conditions).
The participant carried out the task, lied to the person waiting to take part 
and took her payment. Then – and this is the crucial measure – the partici­
pant was asked how much she really enjoyed the original experiment.
)>>
The results were remarkable and completely counter-intuitive. The partici­
pants who were paid $20 said that, to be honest, they didn’t really enjoy the 
original task. It was kinda boring. But the people paid $1 claimed to have 
enjoyed the original peg-turning task. They may have been bored at first, but 
they came to like it eventually.
What’s happening here? Why did the people paid less money to tell a lie end 
up believing that lie? Festinger produced an elegant explanation for this behav­
iour, which also explains the puzzling behaviour he observed in ­doomsday 
cults in the preceding section: people seek to reduce cognitive ­dissonance by 
creating a new belief or rejecting an old one.

103
 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
All the participants in Festinger’s experiment were asked to lie to the 
person in the waiting room. Most people don’t see themselves as liars but 
think that they’re honest, decent people. So the fact that the participants 
lied produced cognitive dissonance for them. How can they reduce this 
unpleasant experience?
The participants paid $20 have a solution. They lied because they were paid 
a substantial amount of money. (By today’s standards, $20 is worth more like 
$150.) This monetary justification reduces the dissonance. It makes sense 
that they lied, because they were handsomely rewarded to do so.
The participants paid $1 didn’t have such a solution. They lied, but they 
weren’t really paid to do so, because $1 didn’t get you very much, even 
in 1950.
)>>
Festinger stated that the $1 people had insufficient justification for their actions. 
These people still have cognitive dissonance. They think that they’re honest 
people, but they lied and have no excuse. So to reduce the dissonance these 
participants changed their beliefs. They decided that, actually, the experiment 
wasn’t too bad after all. In fact, they quite enjoyed it. If they enjoyed it, they 
weren’t lying when they spoke to the person in the waiting room. With this new 
set of beliefs, the dissonance disappeared.
As Festinger said, ‘People come to believe in and love the things they have to 
suffer for.’ It may not be the most romantic thing to put on a Valentine card, 
but it has solid scientific support.
Explaining the power of fraternities
People encounter cognitive dissonance in all walks of life. For example, initia­
tion rites are a common feature of many clubs, societies and organisations. 
You can see them in fraternities, in army platoons and high-school cliques. To 
become a member of the group, you must undergo a series of challenging and 
often unpleasant activities. In American universities, this is called hazing.
I was walking across the campus of a US university and saw three rows of 
young men lined up in front of a house. Though the temperature was freez­
ing and deep snow lay all around, they were wearing only underwear. They 
were shuffling together to the left and then the right shouting ‘bleep bleep’ 
with each step. On the porch of the house sat another young man, wrapped 
in a warm coat, throwing snowballs at them. Whenever someone was hit they 
collapsed to the ground shouting ‘bloop bloop bloop’. This was a game of 
human space invaders.
www.it-ebooks.info

104
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
The fraternity member on the porch was hazing new students. If they put up 
with this treatment (and worse) for a week they had a chance of joining the 
fraternity. Now how do you think those young students feel about the guy on 
the porch? How would you feel about people who bullied you for their own 
amusement? Well, when they’re accepted into the group, the young, abused 
frat members feel nothing but love and respect for their tormentors. They 
have insufficient justification for putting up with the hazing experience. After 
all, no rational person lies in the snow half-naked by choice.
The only way to rationalise their own behaviour, to reduce their cognitive 
dissonance, is to believe that the fraternity is a wonderful institution with 
great guys who they’re desperate to live with.
Justifying it all . . . for love!
Cognitive dissonance doesn’t just help explain frats and cults (see the pre­
ceding sections). It also helps to explain your everyday feelings and behav­
iour, too, such as persisting with lousy relationships.
Perhaps you’ve been in a bad relationship, looking across at the unappealing 
slob on the sofa, wondering how you ended up dating someone who does 
nothing but watch TV and eat crisps, loudly. Perhaps the thought occurs to 
you, ‘Why on earth am I dating the person? I guess I must really love them.’ 
Festinger would say that you have insufficient justification for being in that 
relationship and to reduce your cognitive dissonance, you justify it to your­
self by assuming ‘it must be love’.
Recently, two researchers provided an elegant demonstration of this point as 
it relates to how people feel about being parents. (For my personal connec­
tion to this research, check out the nearby sidebar ‘Scientists versus babies’!)
Studies show repeatedly that parents, compared to couples without children, 
have lower satisfaction with their lives and marriages, are more likely to be 
depressed and less likely to experience happiness. So from a purely rational 
standpoint, why do people seek out parenthood? Why do they speak about 
being a parent in such reverential tones, describing it as the fulfilment of 
their lives? Why is parenthood idealised when it brings relative unhappiness?
Steven Moch and his colleague Richard Eibach asked parents how much they 
liked being mums and dads. They used a variety of measures, asking people 
to rate statements about the importance of children to estimate how many 
hours they wanted to spend with their children that weekend. The research­
ers hypothesised that cognitive dissonance influenced how parents answered 
these questions.
www.it-ebooks.info

105
 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
To test their idea, they divided the parents into three groups:
)>>
✓)>>The first group was told some facts about being a parent. They were 
informed that it costs, on average, about $200,000 to raise a child to 
the age of 16 in the United States. That’s the cost of food, clothes, medi­
cines and so on. After learning of the substantial financial burden their 
children had placed upon them, the parents filled in the questionnaires 
about how much they idealised parenthood.
)>>
✓)>>The second group was told the same information about the costs, 
but also some of the practical benefits of being a parent. When you’re 
elderly, you’re much better off having children. You’re happier and 
healthier if you have your children, and perhaps their children, visiting 
you, looking after you and caring for you in your old age.
)>>
✓)>>The last group was given no information and simply asked to fill in the 
questionnaires.
)>>
Who do you think loves their children more? The parents who are told only of 
the costs of having kids, or those who are told about the advantages as well? 
By now, you may have guessed the answer, but try posing that question to 
someone who hasn’t read this chapter.
)>>
The remarkable, counter-intuitive answer is that when told only of the finan­
cial burden of being a parent, people idealised parenthood more, saying that 
they’d spend more time with their children and valued that time more. Those 
people had experienced the most cognitive dissonance. To remove that dis­
sonance, they shifted their attitudes. They rationalised the financial and emo­
tional cost of being a parent by telling themselves that being a parent was a 
hugely rewarding activity.
Scientists versus babies
My friend Steve visited my wife and me a few 
weeks after our twins were born. Life isn’t easy 
with new-born twins, and we already had a 
2-year-old as well. When I opened the door to 
Steve in his immaculate, well-pressed clothes, 
I hadn’t slept more than three hours a day, had 
baby spit over my shirt and in my hair, and I smelt 
of wee and desperation. Steve was a great help 
that week as we looked after our three children, 
feeding them round the clock, sleeping in shifts 
and eating the food he made. In return, I dis­
covered much later, we gave him the idea for 
an experiment. Steve’s basic research question 
was: why on earth do people go through the 
trauma of having children? Though to be fair, 
I don’t think that it was only my children that 
made Steve ask that question.
www.it-ebooks.info

106
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
The research revealed that people have children despite the considerable 
costs and the burden because, in some way, they idealise being a parent . . . not 
despite those costs but because of them.
Of course, the researchers aren’t saying that the only reason people have 
children is cognitive dissonance. No one doubts the considerable rewards 
of being a parent. The point is that parenthood tends to be idealised: the 
negative side of being a parent tends to get ignored and glossed over. These 
results are not just limited to parenting, of course. You could say the same 
about buying a mobile home. After being reminded of the costs of maintain­
ing a mobile home – the fuel bills, parking fees, maintenance budget – I would 
predict that people are more likely to tell you that buying a mobile home was 
the best investment that they ever made, and that they value the freedom it 
brings them. Mobile homes or children: part of the reason that we love these 
things despite the costs is cognitive dissonance.
Looking at some objections to the 
cognitive dissonance theory
Festinger’s ideas continue to generate new hypotheses and experiments to 
this day. Some researchers, however, aren’t convinced by his theory. They 
think that cognitive dissonance makes some strange assumptions about how 
mental processes work.
)>>
The trouble is that Festinger’s theory states that dissonance is produced when 
a set of attitudes or behaviours contradict each other. When, for example, 
you believe your guru’s promise that the world’s going to end on Friday, 13 
December, and today is December 14, these two ideas clearly contradict each 
So what do you want for your birthday?
Perhaps you have a birthday coming up and are 
hoping that your parents are going to push the 
boat out this year and get you something a little 
special. What can you do to increase the value 
of your birthday present? Remind your parents 
of the time when you were six and it was their 
wedding anniversary, and you got up early and 
made them a breakfast of fudge?
No, to increase their appreciation of you, 
remind them of the time you played football in 
the front room, smashed their best wine glasses 
and tried to blame it on the goldfish. They then 
try and justify to themselves why they put up 
with you all those years. The only explanation 
is that they must really love you.

 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
other and you need to resolve that dissonance somehow. But, the objection 
goes, human feelings and behaviours aren’t usually this clearly defined. And 
how often do people really go through their thoughts and behaviours, check­
ing to see whether they’re logically consistent? Not very often, I expect.
In light of such objections, other theories arose, one of which I discuss in the 
next section.
Looking at Yourself: Self-Perception 
Theory
Researcher Daryl Bem thought that cognitive dissonance (which I discuss in 
the preceding sections) didn’t reflect accurately how people think about their 
own thoughts. He argued that often people don’t really know exactly how they 
feel, or that how they feel is ambiguous and changes from moment to moment.
As Chapters 4 and 5 reveal, attitudes are slippery things. Often people appear 
to believe quite contradictory things: they support the theory of ‘giving money 
to people who are poor’ but don’t support in practice ‘welfare programmes’. 
Humans aren’t like Mr Spock in Star Trek, with a robotic grasp of logic and of 
their own minds, and so how can logical contradictions generate attitude and 
behaviour change? Therefore, Bem proposed an alternative: self-perception 
theory.
Explaining yourself to yourself
Here’s how the self-perception theory works. When you see other people, you 
seek explanations for their actions. For example, while standing on a train plat­
form you see a lady eating furiously and so you conclude that she’s probably 
hungry. If two people embrace when meeting, you guess that they’re in love.
)>>
Self-perception theory claims that you look at your own behaviour in a similar 
way and come up with conclusions. So you eat a whole sandwich while read­
ing the newspaper, look down at the empty wrapper and then conclude, ‘I 
must have been hungry.’ You find yourself sitting opposite the same person 
at the dinner table for several years and assume that you’re both in a loving, 
long-term relationship.
Self-perception theory – just like the cognitive-dissonance theory – also 
makes the counter-intuitive prediction that behaviour can cause attitudes. 
Although common sense says that you don’t need to look at your behaviour 
www.it-ebooks.info

108
Part II: Understanding Attitudes and Actions 
to know whether you’re hungry or in love (you just know it), the predictions 
of self-perception theory have been repeatedly borne out. Often, attitudes 
follow behaviour and seem to be a way in which people explain their own 
actions. Read on to see how . . .
Seeing that rewards and punishments 
can backfire
Researchers have found that self-perception theory makes surprising predic­
tions about how people respond to rewards. Say, for example, you want to 
encourage children to draw during their play time. Perhaps you offer them a 
reward for drawing, so that they associate drawing with the pleasurable reward.
Researchers carried out just such an experiment. One group of children were 
told that they would each be given a reward of a sticker after a drawing activ­
ity during class. Another group did the same activity but didn’t expect to 
be rewarded. Then, at playtime, the paper and crayons were left out on the 
table. The researchers’ dependent variable was how many children chose to 
return to drawing when they had a free choice.
Using self-perception theory to your advantage
An old Rabbi lived in Germany. One day, some 
children gathered outside his house, shouted 
abuse and threw stones at his window. The 
Rabbi came outside to talk to them. ‘Boys,’ he 
said, ‘I want to say thank you. I think that what 
you said about me is right. In fact, I want to 
pay you to come back and do the same thing 
tomorrow.’ The children thought this was odd, 
but took the Rabbi’s money. The next day they 
returned and shouted more abuse. Again the 
Rabbi came out, thanked them and paid them to 
come back. On the third day, the boys shouted 
their insults, threw stones and then knocked 
on the Rabbi’s door. ‘I’m so sorry boys,’ said 
the Rabbi, ‘You did a great job, but I don’t have 
any more money to pay you. Will you still come 
back?’ Angrily, the boys refused and left. They 
never bothered the Rabbi again.
The wily Rabbi didn’t try to persuade the boys 
to stop their abuse, threaten them with punish­
ment from the police or their parents, or even 
try to show them that their insults were wrong 
or hurtful. But he successfully and cleverly 
changed their behaviour by manipulating their 
self-perception.
The boys wanted to abuse and frighten him, 
but he walked outside and offered them money. 
If you were sitting across the street and saw 
the Rabbi hand the boys some coins after they 
threw the rocks, you’d assume they were doing 
it for the money. He made the boys perceive 
their own behaviour in the same way; they also 
concluded that they were acting in order to get 
paid. Like any workers, if they weren’t going to 
get paid, they walked!

 Chapter 6: Investigating the Link between Behaviour and Attitudes
)>>
The striking result was that many fewer children chose to pick up a crayon 
when they’d been rewarded previously. The reason, self-perception theory 
says, is that they ‘saw’ their own behaviour – drawing and getting a sticker – 
and assumed that the reason that they were drawing in the first place was to 
get the sticker. At playtime, without any grown-ups around to give out stickers, 
they had no reason to be drawing.
This result was surprising at the time and appeared to go directly against any 
sort of common-sense understanding, which said that surely people are more 
likely to do something if they’re rewarded for doing it. That thought led to 
many years of programmes in schools and prisons that rewarded people for 
engaging in good behaviour, such as getting good grades or just staying out of 
trouble. The problem with these schemes is that the people, perceiving their 
own behaviour, assume that the reason for the positive behaviour is the reward. 
So behaviour may improve when the person is still in school or in prison, but 
when they leave and the reward goes away, so do all the improvements.
Surprising, don’t you think: that rewarding good behaviour can make people 
behave worse!
Assessing self-perception theory
I mention self-perception theory and cognitive-dissonance theory many times 
during this book. You can see that they make very similar predictions about 
human behaviour. In fact, you can go through the examples in the earlier 
section ‘Dealing with Conflicting Ideas: Cognitive Dissonance’ – the cults, the 
fraternities, the bad relationships and parenthood – and explain the same 
results with self-perception theory. So which one is a better explanation of 
the relationship between our behaviour and attitudes?
Well, both theories seem to do good job of explaining the available research 
data and both have their place:
)>>
✓)>>Cognitive-dissonance theory is easier to apply when the attitudes and 
behaviour are clearly defined and easy to interpret.
)>>
✓)>>Self-perception theory is easier to apply when attitudes and feelings are 
uncertain or ambiguous.
So, for now, claiming that one is superior to the other is impossible.
Perhaps a third theory will appear that does a better job. As I state in Chapter 3, 
scientists never really prove that one theory is true above all others; all they 
can do is reject theories when the data allow. And right now, these two theories 
are still standing after all these years.

✓)>> Track them back to their sources: People notice patterns in the social world around 
them, but although people are very good at noticing these patterns, they’re also adept at 
seeing things that aren’t there. They jump to conclusions, and ignore evidence that con­
tradicts their beliefs.
)>>
✓)>> Discover the bias in social judgements: Many people are convinced that solid, physical 
differences exist between women’s and men’s brains, which explain and justify the differ­
ent jobs and responsibilities that men and women tend to have. There’s no safe evidence 
for this, but it doesn’t stop researchers looking for and finding what they want to see.
)>>
✓)>> Beware what you think you already know: People pay attention to information that sup­
ports their beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them. This confirmation bias 
feeds the habit of stereotyping people, and because your stereotype guides and labels 
your perception, you find confirmation of it everywhere.
)>>
✓)>> Look out for illusory correlations: People and events that are unusual tend to attract your 
attention and stick in the memory. So say you see a Croatian football supporter starting a 
fight. You haven’t met many Croatians before and the event is unusual, and so you come 
to the conclusion that Croatian football supporters are very aggressive people. That’s an 
illusory correlation.

✓)>> Don’t make all your predictions come true: When you have a certain belief, act in accor­
dance with it and your belief is indeed confirmed, it’s called a self-fulfilling prophecy, 
which is another bias in behaviour that helps to perpetuate stereotypes.

Asking the Perennial Question: 
Who Am I?
In This Chapter
▶)>>Creating a sense of self
▶)>>Exploring the consequences of identity
▶)>>Achieving success and healthy self-esteem
T

hroughout the ages, the question ‘Who am I?’ has been asked by phi­
losophers, kings, prophets and – most of all – by mopey teenagers after 
breaking into their parents’ drinks cabinet. Here, I am not really interested in 
what the philosophers or the theologians have to say; I’m not going to dis­
cuss the soul or definitions of consciousness. I’m much more concerned with 
that introspective teenager. In other words, I want to explore how people 
understand themselves. What they think their strengths and weaknesses are, 
what people and social groups are important to them, and what stories they 
tell about themselves.
Modern technology has brought questions of identity into sharper focus in 
recent years by providing the opportunity to form social bonds with more 
people than your grandparents met in their entire lives. Social media is 
marvellous, but it creates a special form of anxiety: self-presentation panic. 
Generations ago people met mostly face-to-face, when a mere glance told you 
a person’s age, sex and probable income and background. Social media pro­
vides none of that. Twitter, Facebook and blogs present you with a blank page 
when you sign up, leaving you to define yourself for the world. (I relate my 
personal struggles with social media in the nearby sidebar ‘The difficulties of 
defining yourself’.)
In this chapter I explore how people define their sense of self: who they think 
they are and how they choose to present themselves to the world. I reveal that 
social forces affect these inward-looking personal thoughts, which are a reflec­
tion not only of who you are, but also how you connect to the social world. 
In addition, I discuss how your self-concept determines your self-esteem, the 
extent to which you succeed in life and your response to challenges.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Constructing Your Sense of Self
The concept of the self is what I call a knotty issue. You don’t know how to 
unpick it, where to start, and even if you should try to unravel it. People 
spend many hours in church or in therapy trying to understand who they 
are and their place in the world. For social psychologists, you don’t find your 
true self, or discover it after it has rolled under a therapist’s couch. The ‘self’ 
is something that is constructed. It is the central character that you make up 
in the story of your life.
If I asked you about a close friend, I’m sure you could tell me about his char­
acter, and illustrate it with anecdotes and behaviour that is typical of him. 
You probably spend a lot of time looking at other people and forming an idea 
about who they are and what makes them tick. In fact, I’m sure that like most 
people you spend more time looking at the faces of others and thinking about 
their thoughts and actions than you do looking at your reflection or ruminat­
ing on yourself. Therefore, how people form their self-concept is an interest­
ing question for social psychologists.

Next time you interact with a baby, try this experiment. With the parents’ per­
mission put a small, brightly coloured little mark on the baby’s forehead. Use 
make-up or perhaps a blob of fruit yoghurt. Don’t use an indelible marker pen 
(or place the blob on the child’s upper lip, unless you want to risk her looking 
like Hitler)! Now carefully carry the baby to a mirror and watch what she does.
Research shows that babies younger than 18 months old reach towards the 
mirror, trying to touch the colourful spot; older than that and they lift a hand 
to their heads to touch the mark.
The difficulties of defining yourself
I find the process of signing up to social media 
painfully difficult, and it usually sends me into 
an existential panic. Do I mention my job first, 
because that’s probably why people are looking 
for me? But I like to think that there’s more to me 
than work. Do I mention that I’m a father? My 
family is a dominant part of my life, but it’s also 
private. Should I say that I’m English? It used to 
be part of my identity when I lived in America ‒ 
not because I wandered around in cricket pads 
sipping tea, but because it mattered to the 
people around me. But introducing myself to 
other English people that way would be strange. 
Do I say that I’m a Tom Waits fan? Is that cool, or 
does it just make me look old? Or is it retro cool?
Then I come to the horror of the profile picture. 
When I first signed up for Facebook, I tried to 
take a picture of myself that wasn’t awful but 
didn’t look as though I’d posed for it. I wasted an 
hour getting an apparently ‘casual’ shot!

Some researchers take this behaviour as evidence that at around the age of 
18 months, infants develop a sense of self. They realise that they too are an 
object in the world. The experiment has been replicated with various primates, 
and only humans and their closest relatives, chimpanzees, appear to pass the 
test. For my personal view, see the nearby sidebar ‘Here’s looking at me, kid!’.
Discovering how you think 
about your identity
Here’s a simple exercise to help you answer the question: ‘Who am I?’ You 
can ask and answer that question in many ways, of course, but I’m interested 
in whatever comes to mind first.
)>>
Take a piece of paper, write down ‘I am . . . ’ and leave the rest of the line 
blank. Repeat for ten lines. Now go back and complete the started statements.
When you’re finished, look back over the list and categorise the statements, 
using subjects such as the following:
)>>
✓)>>Physical attributes about yourself: Such as your age or appearance.
)>>
✓)>>Psychological attributes: Such as saying that you’re a cheerful person 
or a pessimist.
)>>
✓)>>Social groups that you belong to: Such as being a student or a sup­
porter of a particular sports team.
)>>
✓)>>Likes or preferences: Such as being a fan of early blues music or a his­
tory buff.
Here’s looking at me, kid!
I’m not sure that the experiments with babies 
and self-identity reveal so much about an 
understanding of the self as they do about mir­
rors. Like many experiments in developmental 
psychology that claim infants acquire a concept 
at a particular stage, you can find adults regu­
larly struggling with similar tests. For example, 
at many sporting events a large video screen 
shows close-ups of the actions. During a lull 
in play, the camera often lingers on the crowd. 
You can always see that it takes a good few 
moments before the people projected onto the 
display board recognise that they’re looking at 
themselves. Clever chimps!

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Psychologists have found many revealing patterns in how people choose to 
complete simple statements such as ‘I am . . . ’. They give different responses 
depending on their mood at that moment, the other people that they’re think­
ing of at the time and even the culture in which they’re raised. (I discuss 
the differences between cultures and their views of the self in more detail in 
Chapter 17.)
)>>
There are many ways to answer the question ‘who am I’, from your appear­
ance to your personality, your social cliques to your home country, your 
biology to your religion. All of these different aspects of the self are valid to 
different people, at different times of their lives, or change according to who 
they are talking to at the moment. Amongst all of these different swirling 
aspects of the self, remembering that there is no such thing as your ‘true self’ 
is important. At least, not one that you can discover through a detox diet.
‘We’re through the looking-glass 
here, people’ 
Like everyone, you come to understand yourself through the way in which 
you understand other people. I discuss this idea, called self-perception theory, 
in Chapter 6 as part of talking about how people explain their own behav­
iour. Some researchers argue that self-perception theory can be extended to 
explain how people acquire a whole sense of who they are.
)>>
The looking-glass self refers to the idea that you see yourself through the eyes 
of other people – crucially, however, not how others actually see you, but how 
you think other people see you.
That this theory is at least partly true is shown by a clever experiment. 
Participants were recruited and asked to help train graduate students who 
were training to be clinicians. The participants sat in a room and answered 
questions over an intercom. They were asked to act in one of two ways: in a 
very reactive, emotional way or in a flat, emotionally unresponsive manner. 
They were told that their acting would be used to help the graduate students 
identify different types of behaviour.
Of course, being a social psychology experiment, that was all a fib. One group 
of participants was told that a clinician would be watching them all the time 
through a one-way mirror. The other group was told that they wouldn’t be 
watched. The key dependent variable was measured afterwards. Participants 
rated how emotionally stable they were – not how they appeared during the 
experiment, but how they really were.

 Chapter 7: Asking the Perennial Question: Who Am I?
The participants acting in an emotionally responsive manner and who 
thought that they’d been watched during their performances felt that they 
genuinely were more emotionally responsive themselves. The opposite result 
occurred when they’d been acting unresponsively. This result didn’t happen, 
however, when the participants thought that they hadn’t been observed.
)>>
In other words, the belief that their behaviour was witnessed by another 
person increased participants’ feeling that their behaviour reflected their true 
nature. The imagined gaze of others multiplies the power of self-perception 
over people’s self-image.
Living through the eyes of others: 
Social comparison theory
The self is formed by social forces, by looking outwards as well as inwards. 
One way in which other people shape who you are is described by Leon 
Festinger’s social comparison theory: people acquire a sense of who they are 
by comparing themselves against those around them.
Imagine that you feel like you’re good at maths, for example, because you 
came top of your class. But you feel that you’re bad at dancing after seeing 
other people at the school disco. (Don’t worry, I’m not going to test you 
with complex algebra or insist that you groove around your home.) These 
facts aren’t objective, of course. If you happen to be placed in a classroom of 
future professional statisticians, inevitably you feel relatively bad at maths. 
On the upside, you may feel like you’re better at dancing.
Festinger realised that these social comparisons aren’t entirely passive or 
accidental. Humans actively seek out particular people to compare them­
selves with and select particular skills or attributes for comparison.
Watching the celebrities
Spare a thought, if you will, for the bizarre lives 
of celebrities. The looking-glass-self experi­
ment shows that simply imagining a graduate 
student watching you pretend to be something 
has the power to shift your concept of your 
self-identity.
Imagine being Charlie Sheen, knowing that 
millions of people watch you each week in a 
sitcom, acting the part of a shallow narcissist. 
Think about what effect that level of atten­
tion has on your sense of self, personality and 
behaviour.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
)>>
As I discuss in Chapter 8, many psychological mechanisms protect or inflate 
your self-esteem: social comparison is one such mechanism. It comes in two 
forms:
)>>
✓)>>Downwards social comparison: You seek out and compare yourself to 
others who you think are inferior in some way, which has the effect of 
raising your self-esteem. This form is the most common type of social 
comparison.
)>>
✓)>>Upwards social comparison: You seek out and compare yourself to 
people you see as superior to you. Researchers have found that making 
this form of social comparison can have a crippling effect on your 
self-esteem.
You can see this psychological mechanism out in force if you ever attend a 
school reunion (or do the online equivalent of looking through your school 
friends’ Facebook pages). You can measure success in life in all sorts of ways – 
income, family, health and so on – and people tend to choose whichever mea­
sure flatters them the most. People with high-earning jobs but no family life 
assess others based on their income and feel good about themselves. People 
who never left the small town they grew up in focus on the failed marriage of 
the high earner and feel good that they raised a happy, healthy family. People 
with poor jobs and no family may observe that at least they didn’t put on so 
much weight.
Of course, sometimes, your ability to make downward comparisons is lim­
ited. For example, avoiding the comparisons that family and teachers may 
make between siblings is difficult: often one’s labelled sporty and the other 
bookish. These comparisons have a substantial effect on siblings.
Personality psychologists and geneticists have studied siblings and found 
puzzling results. Usually siblings share much of their genes and much of their 
environment, growing up in the same place with the same parents. Given 
all these shared influences, they should be extremely similar to each other. 
Scientists try to predict how similar siblings should be given knowledge of 
genetics and heritability, studies of twins raised apart and so on. However, 
siblings are often a lot less similar than you’d expect.
)>>
One explanation is that social comparisons are driving siblings apart. Imagine 
a pair of twins, for example. Perhaps one runs slightly faster at a school sports 
day. That child may choose to compare herself on that physical dimension. It 
then becomes part of her identity, which increases her self-esteem and moti­
vation to train and to improve herself further. Yet she may have run faster on 
that sports day just because the other twin was recovering from a cold. But 
the random difference in performance that day can set off a chain of social 
comparisons and shifts in identity that many years later produces a sibling 
who’s more athletic than the other.

 Chapter 7: Asking the Perennial Question: Who Am I?
Finding a Place in the World: 
Consequences of Identity
Your self-concept has a remarkable effect on how you experience success and 
failure in life. Conventional wisdom has been that high self-esteem is the most 
important factor. But recent psychological science reveals the importance of 
how you construe your self-concept and how you connect yourself to others.
Identifying with others: basking 
in reflected glory
I’m writing this section the day after Andy Murray won the Wimbledon tour­
nament. An Englishman last achieved the most sought after prize in tennis 
77 years ago. Today, everyone in London seems that much happier that ‘we 
have finally won it’. Of course, Andy Murray isn’t English; he’s a Scot. He 
didn’t train in the UK; he went to Spain and Florida. But 17 million people 
across the country watched and cheered him on yesterday, and today they 
feel better about themselves.
How can the actions of one sportsperson affect the self-esteem of millions? 
What connection do most Londoners really have to Andy Murray?
Researchers call this effect basking in reflective glory and it has been demon­
strated many times in experiments. For example, at a campus university, par­
ticipants were given an exam to do and then told either that they scored very 
well or very poorly. Their real scores were irrelevant, because the research­
ers were in fact interested in their next question.
They asked the participants about a recent sports match that their univer­
sity had won. The participants who were told that they did more poorly on 
the exam seemed to identify more with the team. For example, compared to 
people who thought they did well on the exam, they were more likely to say 
‘we played really well’ rather than ‘the team played well’. This experiment 
shows that self-esteem and social identity are linked.
Conversely, when people associate with a team or a group and they lose, 
people tend to distance themselves. After losing a final, a team’s supporters 
are less likely to wear the shirt the next day. Before an election, the support­
ers of a political party may have signs on their lawns or banners in their win­
dows. But the day after they lose the election, people take down those signs 
much quicker than the victors.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
The social ties that we have to certain groups or teams are bound to our 
personal self-esteem. When people feel bad about themselves, or when their 
team is winning, they strengthen those ties. But when their team loses, they 
cut them off just as quickly.
)>>
Social identity theory attempts to account for when and how people seek con­
nection to different social groups and how they treat people inside their social 
group differently to outsiders. Your self-concept isn’t a static entity. Your identity 
and connection to different groups waxes and wanes in order to cast yourself in 
the best possible light. (I discuss social identity theory more in Chapter 16.)
Don’t believe the stereotype hype
With one stroke, society could remove the gender difference between boys’ 
and girls’ success in mathematics exams. Not by changing how the questions 
are phrased or how difficult they are, but simply by changing how students 
identify themselves on the first page of their answer booklets.
I realise that this statement may seem over the top, but Claude Steele and 
other researchers have uncovered a remarkable fact about examinations and 
self-identity. Imagine that a negative stereotype exists about one aspect of 
your identity and the test you’re about to take: for example, that girls are bad 
at spatial reasoning or Black Americans tend to perform relatively poorly on 
standardised tests. Some of these differences have existed in the past; Claude 
Steele and others wanted to know whether this was because of a true differ­
ence in ability, or just because people believed that there was a difference.
Research shows that if you’re made aware of that aspect of your identity, 
your performance on a challenging test immediately suffers. If you have a 
box on the front of a mathematics exam where you have to write ‘M’ or ‘F’ to 
declare your sex, females go on to perform worse on that test. If you have to 
declare your ethnicity before turning over your exam paper, your test results 
go down if you’re Black American, but they go up if you’re Asian American 
due to the positive stereotypical view of their ability.
Another remarkable effect of this stereotype threat is that you can make people 
aware of some aspect of their identities simply by asking them to write the ste­
reotype down on the front of the form. In doing so, you make them more aware 
of their expectations about how they will perform and attitudes about that part 
of themselves, and that awareness directly influences their performance.
These differences aren’t small. They’re about the same size as the differences 
reported as the average difference between males and females on maths 
tests, or the average difference between White and Black Americans on stan­
dardised tests.

)>>
In other words, the reported academic differences between the sexes or 
between ethics groups may not be caused by real differences in ability but by 
believed differences that come from stereotypes and prejudice.
Trying hard is better than being a genius
A child bounces up to you holding her school work, perhaps she’s your 
daughter, cousin or a neighbour. She proudly shows you a big red A at the 
bottom of the test. How do you praise her?
For decades, people have been told that praise is vital for happy and healthy 
children and that the most important job in raising a child is nurturing her 
self-esteem. Recently, however, Carol Dweck and other researchers found 
that how people are praised is very important. They discovered that if you 
say ‘what a very clever girl you are!’ to the child showing you an A, you may 
cause her more harm than good.
)>>
The reason is that praise can shape children’s view of themselves. You can 
think of ability or success in two general ways:
)>>
✓)>>Entity theorists: These people think that musicians, mathematicians or 
athletes are born that way. They believe that ability is a thing that you 
either have or don’t have. When you say to a child who has succeeded, 
‘You’re such a clever girl’, you’re endorsing this view of her ability. 
You’re saying that she succeeded because she’s simply clever.
)>>
✓)>>Incremental theorists: These people believe that success is born of hard 
work. They think that when you put more effort into something, you’re 
more likely to succeed. When you say to a child, ‘Well done – you must 
have worked really hard!’, you’re endorsing an incremental theory of ability.
You may be wondering whether it really matters what children believe about 
their success, so long as they feel good about it. Well, think about what hap­
pens when, inevitably, the child has a bad day. She gets all the bad calls from 
the referee or the exam covers the one topic that she didn’t have the time to 
study. How does she explain this failure?
If the child holds an entity theory, she’s forced to conclude that she’s not 
very talented, clever or gifted. When these children fail, they don’t want to 
try again. Their self-esteem is damaged, because they have to revise their 
opinions of themselves downwards.
But if they hold an incremental theory, they can explain their failures with 
the thought that on that day they didn’t try hard enough, or they tried the 
wrong strategy when studying for the test. The failure isn’t as detrimental to 
www.it-ebooks.info

122
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
their self-esteem, because it just says something about what happened on the 
day and not whether they’re fundamentally good or bad at something. These 
children are less likely to be demotivated by failure. They pick themselves up 
and try again. In the long run, these children succeed and are happier.
The results of research are very clear. For example, if a maths class spends a 
week discovering how they can increase mathematical ability through prac­
tice, the students’ exam scores rise across the board. If you train parents and 
teachers to praise effort rather than label a child’s ‘talent’, children’s perfor­
mance improves.
These results go against strong feelings that certain types of ability – particularly 
sports, maths and art – are things that you’re just born with. Experts test 
students incessantly in schools, trying to track academic performance; profes­
sional talent spotters trawl schools looking for the next genius footballer among 
the 9-year-olds. But the research tells a clear and compelling story.
)>>
For your children to succeed and be happy, you need to convince them that 
success comes from effort, not from some talent that they’re born with or not.
Therefore, Andy Murray won the Wimbledon title not because he was British 
or because he was the most gifted player. It was, in part, because of his self-
concept. Immediately after the match he spoke first of all about losing the 
year before and how it had shaken him. But crucially, he responded to this 
by returning to the gym, working twice as hard and training more than any 
player on the professional circuit. I argue that it wasn’t his belief in his talent, 
but his faith in hard work that won the tournament.

H

ow do you measure up to the rest of the world? If everyone formed a 
queue according to how talented, attractive or moral they were, where 
would you stand? Are you good enough to get into heaven?
A newspaper in the US carried out a survey that asked people who they 
thought would pass through the pearly gates into heaven. People were split 
over Bill Clinton, the president at the time, with 52 per cent thinking that 
he’d get in. Oprah Winfrey was a better bet, they thought, at 66 per cent and 
Mother Teresa scored even higher. But people taking the survey identified 
one person with an even greater chance of getting into heaven: themselves.
Even though the people surveyed were unlikely to have devoted their lives 
to serving God and helping poor and needy orphans like the modern-day 
saint Mother Teresa, many thought that they had a greater chance of going to 
heaven than her: 87 per cent as against 79 per cent.
Clearly something odd is at work here in relation to people’s self-perception. 
Despite being differing widely in appearance, personality and abilities, social 
psychology finds that people are very similar in one regard: how they view 
themselves.
In this chapter I look at some of the ways in which people are biased when 
they think about themselves (called positive illusions). Often they have an 
inflated view of their own talent and ability, think that they’re right most of 
the time and mistake how long an event is going to make them happy or sad.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
I know that the first two points sound as if I’m describing a horrible narcis­
sist, like someone from TV’s The Apprentice, but the fact is that although 
most people appear modest and self-effacing, social psychology shows that 
they inflate systematically their self-image. Everyone chooses how they pres­
ent themselves to others on the outside, but on the inside most people har­
bour a boastful egotist.
Looking at Yourself: Positive Illusions
‘Know yourself’: this was inscribed into Apollo’s Temple in Delphi, and is one 
of the oldest nuggets of ancient Greek wisdom. Today, with constant stan­
dardised exams in schools, personality and aptitude tests in the workplace, 
and daily online quizzes to find out ‘which character from Game of Thrones 
are you most like?’, surely we have achieved all the ancient Greeks could 
desire in terms of knowledge about ourselves?
Well, not quite. Although people certainly have a lot of opinions about them­
selves, all those judgments tend to have a widespread and systematic bias. 
As I will show, they fall prey to positive illusions. People tend to overrate 
their strengths, downplay their weaknesses and think that they are just a 
little bit better than everyone else.
Believing that you’re better than average
Garrison Keillor began his book about the fictional town of Lake Wobegon by 
saying that it was where ‘ . . . all the children are above average’. Of course, 
all parents think that their children are special and wonderful in some way. 
But it is clearly a joke, and clearly impossible, that they are all above average. 
Surprisingly, psychologists have found that it is not just parents in Keillor’s 
book who have such positive illusions. In the exercise below, you can see if 
your friends and family also have such positive views of themselves.
)>>
Try asking some of the people around you to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 
100. You can ask about any qualities you want, but here are some suggestions:
)>>
✓)>>How generous are you?
)>>
✓)>>How good is your sense of humour?
)>>
✓)>>How safe a driver are you?

 Chapter 8: How Fantastic Am I! Looking at Self-serving Bias
In each case, you can choose to tell people ‘give me a number between 1 and 
100, where 50 is the average person’ or, after they’ve ranked themselves, you 
can ask ‘what do you think the average person would score?’.
I predict that for each of these questions, people will rate themselves well 
above the ‘average person’. Not by a wide, arrogant margin, perhaps, but con­
sistently higher in each case. I would also predict that you’d have answered 
the same, if you hadn’t already started reading this book, of course.
)>>
Don’t worry if you don’t find from your small survey that most people think 
that they’re above average, because plenty of very strong data supports this 
claim.
One year, almost a million US students filled in surveys before leaving high 
school at the age of 18: in the survey, 89 per cent rated themselves as above 
average at ‘getting along with others’. If those students were accurate judges 
of their own sociability, about 50 per cent would say that they’re above aver­
age, because that’s what ‘average’ means. But their estimate was far, far 
above that. And this is not just a feature of American students either. The 
same results have been replicated across the world.
)>>
The above-average effect isn’t just large, it’s also stubborn. One researcher 
asked people to rate how safe a driver they are: most rated themselves as 
‘better than average’. But here’s the twist: at the time of answering the survey 
these people were convalescing in hospital as a result of car accidents for 
which they admitted they were at fault!
The above-average effect varies for different sorts of qualities, being stronger 
for aspects that are subjective and socially desirable. For example:
)>>
✓)>>Being good at mathematics is objective and easy to measure with an 
exam, and so it is less likely to show the effect.
)>>
✓)>>Being aggressive isn’t usually seen as desirable, and so it shows the 
effect less.
)>>
✓)>>Being sociable, a good friend or lucky are seen as desirable qualities, but 
they are hard to measure objectively, and so they display the effect more 
often.
)>>
If something reflects well upon you and is hard to measure, you often assume 
that you’re better at it than most.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Judging yourself as better 
than you used to be
Not only do people view themselves as better than other people, but also as 
better than they themselves were. This comparison with a past self is a form 
of downwards comparison, which I discuss in Chapter 7. People raise their 
self-esteem by judging themselves favourably against other people, which in 
this case includes themselves in the past.
)>>
Ask some people how likable they were a year ago and how likeable they think 
they are today.
Most people probably give themselves a higher rating for how they are now 
than how they were in the past. People often think that they’re improving, 
even when research reveals no objective change in these traits.
Interestingly, however, when you ask people to rate how likeable a friend 
was a year ago and how likeable that person is now, you tend not to see a big 
difference. So this flattering contrast with the past is something that people 
only do when thinking about themselves.
Estimating your strengths as rare but 
your failures as commonplace
)>>
Despite often having a positive bias when evaluating themselves, people aren’t 
completely blind to their failings. Even here, however, people display a self-
serving bias:
)>>
✓)>>They tend to see negative events as externally caused, unstable and 
specific. In other words, they failed the driving test because the driving 
examiner was mean, and it won’t happen with another instructor the 
next time.
)>>
✓)>>They tend to view positive events as internally caused, stable and global. 
So they win a family quiz game because they’re highly intelligent, they’d 
win the game next time and would probably win those quiz shows on TV.
This bias affects beliefs about other people too. People assume that bad 
aspects of their characters are commonplace. For example, shoplifters over­
estimate that a higher number of other people also shoplift. If they procrasti­
nate a lot, they think that most people are the same way.

 Chapter 8: How Fantastic Am I! Looking at Self-serving Bias
But people think that their good qualities are rare. If they win a sports trophy 
at school, they underestimate the number of other people who have such a 
trophy somewhere in a cupboard. If they’re very organised, they tend to think 
that other people lack the same skill.

Bear in mind this self-serving bias if you’re ever reading through applications 
for a job or a place at college. My record was one round of student applica­
tions where I counted 17 people with a ‘unique thirst for knowledge’!
Self-handicapping: Failure 
isn’t your fault
Many positive illusions have a beneficial effect for the self: they make people 
feel happier. But the need to have a positive view of yourself is so strong that 
it can backfire and, perversely, make your life worse. This behaviour is called 
self-handicapping, and I bet you’ve done it.
)>>
Imagine the night before an important maths exam; you have only the last few 
hours to study and are starting to panic. In this situation, have you ever found 
yourself suddenly deciding to go out with your friends? Or turning on the TV 
and watching a sitcom marathon? Or starting a computer game to finish ‘just 
one more level’ and then completing the whole game? Afterwards, you col­
lapse asleep exhausted, your books untouched.
When self-handicapping, you’re engaging in behaviour that you know will 
harm your chances of succeeding: you know that you won’t do as well on the 
test if you go out the night before, but you do it anyway. Why would anyone 
intentionally harm their chances of success?
Well, here’s a possible answer. Say that you do study hard. You go to bed at 
a decent time and get eight hours of sleep. Then you take the maths test, 
but don’t do well: you only get a C. What can you conclude about yourself? 
Probably that you’re just not good at maths, which is a pretty hard blow to 
your self-esteem.
But if you self-handicap, you’ll never be in this position because you’re creat­
ing a reason for your failure. You were bound to get a C, you can tell yourself, 
because you went out dancing till 2 a.m. That C doesn’t mean that you’re bad 
at maths; it just means that you like to party.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Self-handicapping seems like a paradox, because people are deliberately 
harming their chances of success. In fact, self-handicapping shows that 
people prefer to fail with certainty and an excuse rather than try hard and 
face the possibility of failure that harms their positive illusions of themselves.
Thinking that You’re Right 
Most of the Time
In Chapter 3, I talk about social psychology’s greatest enemy: common sense. 
Whenever you describe a finding or an experiment, someone is bound to 
exclaim, ‘I knew that all along!’ This phenomenon is called hindsight bias.
Social psychologists have identified several of these biases that inflate peo­
ple’s self-concept by convincing them that they’re right, have always been 
right and people with a different opinion are simply uninformed. These biases 
often serve a useful function of protecting and nurturing self-esteem, but they 
can also lead people into conflict and confusion.
In this section I describe why you always think that you’ve made the right 
choice, your beliefs are spot-on and other people are simply wrong!
Bias and politics
During the 2004 US election, the Democrats 
spotted a weakness in Republican President 
George W. Bush. He announced a tax cut for 
everyone in the country, but when the Democrats 
reviewed the details of his plan they calculated 
that although most people would get something 
back, 95 per cent of the money was going to 
the richest 5 per cent of the population. The 
Democrats made this statistic headline news, 
convinced that it would portray the president in 
a very poor light with the majority of voters.
Bush won the election, however. Further inves­
tigation revealed one possible reason why the 
Democrats’ attack on the tax plan backfired. 
Apparently, about 40 per cent of the American 
population thought that they were in the rich­
est 5 per cent of the population or soon would 
be. The Democrats’ used careful statistics to 
show that Bush was favouring a tiny minority 
of the super-rich, but they ran afoul of people’s 
inflated self-concept.

If something is associated with the self, by choice or by accident, its value 
goes up in people’s eyes. If something isn’t associated with the self, because 
the person didn’t choose it or it rejected them, its perceived value goes down. 
Experiments show this reality time and again. It works for large things like 
your home and career, but also for trivial things like the mugs and pens that 
you own that seem so much better than the near identical but clearly inferior 
mugs and pens that other people possess.
In one experiment, participants were shown six different art prints and asked 
to rank them in order of preference. They were then told that they could take 
one of them home. But sadly, the researcher lied, saying that only two of them 
were in stock. The participants were offered a choice between their fourth- and 
fifth-ranked pictures. Unsurprisingly, most chose the fourth-ranked picture.
Several days later the researcher called the participants back to the lab. They 
were shown the same set of prints and asked to rank them again. Typically, 
the picture that they took home, previously ranked fourth, now jumped up 
the ranking to first or second place. The picture that they didn’t choose to 
take home slipped down the ranking to last place.
)>>
People are used to the idea that their opinions determine their choices, but 
this experiment shows that, surprisingly, choices also influence opinions.
People are biased towards anything associated with themselves and against 
things that they lose or that reject them. Contestants on game shows esti­
mate the value of prizes as much higher if they’ve just won them. Students 
are suddenly aware of a college’s weaknesses after it rejects them, and people 
conclude that standardised tests are biased just after they fail one.
Being sure that your beliefs are correct
)>>
Everyone is fallible as regards biased thinking, something called naive realism: 
the mistaken belief that your own subjective view of the world is a true, objec­
tive view. It has been called the biggest bias in social thinking. It pervades rea­
soning and explains why people argue and fail to resolve their differences.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Here’s an example from my own life. When I started my Ph.D., I got my first 
Apple computer. I loved it, and I’m on my ninth Apple Mac in a row. Right 
now, next to my laptop is sitting an iPad, and next to that an iPhone. They 
look like high-tech Russian dolls. I’ve tried to use other people’s PCs, but I 
find them incredible badly designed. Nothing is where I expect it to be, and 
the menus are counterintuitive. I had an Android phone once, but its case 
kept falling off. Admittedly, this was because I kept throwing it against the 
wall in frustration. In short, I love Apple products because they’re the best.
But with that last statement, I’ve made a huge error: I’ve fallen foul of biased 
thinking. I believe that Apple products are better than their competitors, but 
a large difference exists between a subjective opinion and an objective fact. 
Objectively, there’s no ‘best’ computer system: just the operating system that 
you’re used to and which best fits your needs. But with computers, sports 
teams, political parties and types of music, people frequently mistake their 
opinions for facts about the world.
)>>
Naive realism produces another effect called false consensus. People tend to 
overestimate the number of people who agree with them. Because they think 
that their opinions are true reflections of the world, seeing why anyone else 
would think otherwise is difficult.
These biases are so hard to avoid because people are limited by their own 
experiences. Chapter 5 reveals that you tend to like things you experience 
a lot – the mere exposure effect. I like Apple computers because I’ve always 
been around them and I’ve had mostly positive experiences. I have difficulty 
imagining liking PCs (or country music or cruise ships) because personally 
I haven’t had many experiences of them and can’t think of reasons to like 
them. So I think falsely that these things are objectively bad. And because 
they’re objectively bad, I think that other people must recognise those ‘facts’ 
too and agree with me.
The world’s biggest bias
Naive realism is remarkably hard to avoid. One 
social psychology professor asked his students 
to define it on their exam. Then he asked them 
how often they thought the average person 
made this mistake and how often they made 
this mistake. The students thought that they 
made the mistake less often than other people. 
In other words, they said that other people 
confused their subjective opinions with fact, 
but they didn’t. Amazingly, they themselves dis­
played the naive realism bias while answering 
an exam question about naive realism, when 
you would think it would be uppermost in their 
minds!

 Chapter 8: How Fantastic Am I! Looking at Self-serving Bias
Regarding everyone else as wrong!
If I think that my opinion is objectively true, what do I think of people who 
disagree with me? Well, they must be biased in their thinking.
The consequences of naive realism (see the preceding section) are all around 
you. Look at any online newspaper article or review that has a comments 
section. Almost all the arguments begin when the subjective opinions of two 
people clash, and each is convinced that theirs is the objective truth.
This tendency has been shown in experiments. Researchers asked participants 
if they’d wear a sandwich board advertising a product and wander around the 
streets. About half the people said yes and half no. The researchers then asked 
them to estimate how many people would make the same choice. Both the 
people who said yes and the people who said no estimated that the majority of 
people would make exactly the same decision as themselves.
This same method of thinking causes enormous trouble for journalists or 
anyone trying to present something as objectively true. When a story dis­
agrees with a reader’s viewpoint, that person accuses the journalist of bias. 
Many newspapers and TV channels tailor their coverage to the viewpoint of 
their customers for this reason.
But organisations such as the BBC can’t do so, because everyone in the 
UK funds it and the government instructs it to be as objective as possible. 
Politically, the BBC is often accused of bias by left- and right-wing parties at 
the same time, which is exactly what you’d expect if it’s giving fair coverage. 
So, counter-intuitively, the more people who accuse the BBC of bias, the more 
balanced it probably is.
Questioning How Long Something 
Makes You Happy
)>>
Generally, people are pretty good at guessing whether something is going 
to feel good or bad. For example, buying a new pair of shoes will feel good; 
wearing them and getting a blister will feel bad. This ability is called affective 
forecasting in psychological jargon. As I reveal in this section, though people 
are very good at judging if something is positive or negative, they’re often very 
poor at judging how long the happiness or sadness is going to last.
www.it-ebooks.info

132
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Psychologist Daniel Gilbert and his colleagues studied affective forecasting, 
because it’s very important in understanding the decisions that you make. 
You don’t just live in the moment but have to make choices based on what 
you think will happen and how you think you’ll feel. Is it worth saving up to 
buy those shoes, or should you go out to dinner instead? Will the shoes make 
you happy enough that you won’t mind hobbling around with a blister for a 
few days? Gilbert found that people are generally very good affective fore­
casters, apart from anticipating the length of the benefit or problem.
)>>
In this section’s discussion of affective forecasting, I’m not talking about hugely 
traumatic and stressful events that trigger severe, clinical mental-health prob­
lems. Instead, I’m focusing on how people react to extreme negative and posi­
tive events when they’re fortunate enough to maintain their mental health.
Trusting that time really does heal
)>>
See how you do with this exercise. Identify which of the following events you’d 
prefer to happen to you next week:
)>>
✓)>>You’re hit by a bus and lose the use of both legs.
)>>
✓)>>You win a million pounds on the lottery.
That’s probably one of the easier questions in this book. No doubt, you guess 
that winning the lottery would make you feel happier than being hit by a bus. 
But now imagine, like in the film Sliding Doors, that two versions of you exist. 
One wins the lottery and feels very happy. The other gets hit by the bus and 
feels very bad. Eventually these two ‘yous’ are going to feel about the same, 
because the joy of winning the lottery is sure to wear off and the unhappiness 
of the accident lessens.
But how much time do you think will pass before the good feeling from the 
lottery win dies away and the bad feeling from the accident fades? How long 
before the two versions of you are equally happy: a month; a year; a decade?
)>>
Most people guess at years, even decades, before this happens. But the remark­
able answer is three months, on average. No matter how wonderful or horrible 
a life experience is, about three months after it happens, your emotions return 
to normal.
The research is quite clear, even for one of the worst experiences that can 
happen to a person: the death of a child. What parents feel when their chil­
dren die is unimaginable for most people, but even after experiencing this 
most horrible of events, after three months most parents are about as happy 
as before their child died. That’s the result of extensive research with parents 
who have been in exactly this situation.

133
 Chapter 8: How Fantastic Am I! Looking at Self-serving Bias
Shifting focus over time
Whenever I tell people about the research in the preceding section, they have 
a hard time believing it. They’re convinced that it must take longer, that their 
affective forecast of years or decades must be right.
People make such long estimates, and then disbelieve they’re wrong, because 
of something called focalism. The idea is that the inherent dramatic nature of 
these events – being hit by a bus, losing a child, winning the lottery – causes 
difficulty for people predicting accurately their emotions about them. People 
focus on the extreme good or bad aspects and ignore everything else that 
would be happening in their future lives.
Think again about how you make affective forecasts. When asked to imagine 
the death of a child and how long the grief lasts, many people view the experi­
ence like a montage in a very sad movie: weeks of grieving and wearing black; 
trying to clear out the child’s bedroom but unable to change a thing; seeing 
the child’s old friends happily hugging their parents; months afterwards find­
ing a broken toy under the sofa; walking past the kitchen wall and looking 
at the marks made each birthday, tracking the height and seeing the marks 
stop when the child was still impossibly small. Each of these moments seems 
unbearably sad. When viewed in this way, imagining that all these horrible 
feelings can disappear after just three months seems impossible.
)>>
The key thing is that in making your affective forecast you’re focusing on the 
worst aspects of the experience. When creating your mental montage of the 
situation you’re looking at the most painful and poignant scenes. But people 
don’t live their lives in montage; they live 24 hours each and every day.
Focusing on sport
The focalism principle is at work in all sorts of 
episodes in people’s lives. Take big sporting 
events. If you talk to sports fans the day before 
their team is in a championship final, they’re 
obsessed by it. Winning means everything and 
losing is inconceivable.
Researchers asked such fans how long they 
thought that they’d be happy if their team won, 
and how long it would take them to get over it if 
they lost. Their estimates were weeks, months 
and even a year. Yet a couple of days after a 
championship win, or a loss, their day-to-day 
happiness is about the same.
In Chapter 7 I write about the day after Andy 
Murray won Wimbledon. Everyone in the UK 
seemed glowing and overjoyed. But a couple 
of days passed and hardly anyone was talking 
about tennis. The intensity of the emotions was 
genuine, but it quickly faded.

134
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
So people fail to imagine those times a week or a month after the event when 
they’re doing the laundry, not thinking about very much; when something 
happens at work they have to concentrate upon; when they volunteer at the 
child’s old school and make connections with other children that make them 
feel needed. These day-to-day experiences determine mood just as much as 
the big tragedies and successes in life (see another example in the nearby 
sidebar ‘Focusing on sport’).
I don’t for a moment mean that parents who’ve lost a child are no longer sad 
about the event three months later. Of course, they remain devastated when­
ever they think about it, probably for the rest of their lives. But for many, 
many moments in the day they aren’t thinking about their lost child, and after 
about three months those mundane other moments are what determine their 
overall happiness.
Looking at the role of your psychological 
immune system
The surprising result of research in affective forecasting is that, in general, 
you’re going to be less sad and less happy than you imagine.
)>>
If you talk to people in happy relationships and ask them how they’d feel if 
they were dumped tomorrow, they reply that it would devastate them, that 
they’d never love again. But when you talk to single people who’ve just been 
dumped or who have been single for a long time, they’re just as happy as 
people in couples.
Similarly, if you ask people how happy they’d be if they got a pay rise tomor­
row, or were sacked and had to take a pay cut, they estimate a huge impact 
on their happiness. Yet researchers find very little correlation between 
wealth and happiness. As incomes rise across society or over the course of 
people’s lives, reported happiness doesn’t change.
)>>
People appear to have developed a robust psychological immune system. Just 
as your body can recover and repair itself physically from many illnesses, so 
you can recover from the worst that life can throw at you.
If you’re unfortunate enough to suffer a tragedy in your life, you can go to 
a Freudian therapist who delves deep into your childhood and blames the 
relationship with your parents. Or you can read all the self-help books on the 
shelf. Or you can listen to the advice that my Granny gave me, and perhaps 
yours gave you too: ‘There, there, give it time. You’ll be okay.’ Much more 
scientific evidence backs Gran’s wisdom than the whole of Freud.

Chapter 9
Attributing Causes to 
People’s Behaviour
In This Chapter
▶)>>Explaining the actions of others
▶)>>Defining the fundamental attribution error
▶)>>Spotting biases in different cultures and situations
T

he ways in which people explain each other’s behaviour is a fascinating 
subject. Often you meet people, appraise their actions and then make 
assumptions about them pretty quickly, without properly understanding how 
you arrive at your decision. And if you’re thinking ‘So what?’, remember that 
other people are doing the same about your behaviour as well. So if you’ve 
ever felt that people have judged you unfairly or leapt to conclusions about 
your behaviour, you may have wondered how and why people understand 
the causes of each other’s behaviour.
Wonder no more, because this chapter provides some possible answers as 
I look into these mysterious processes. I introduce what I mean by an attri­
bution in the social-psychological context and reveal a central mistake that 
many people make when assessing the causes of other people’s behaviour, 
called the fundamental attribution error.
Not for the first (or last) time in this book, you discover that the way in 
which people use so-called common sense doesn’t seem to match up with 
the scientific evidence from experiments. Read the nearby sidebar ‘Buttering 
up the public’ for a revealing and apparently counterintuitive example, which 
was used successfully in advertising.

136
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Introducing the Concept of 
Making Attributions
)>>
An attribution is psychologist jargon for an explanation that links a person’s 
behaviour to a cause. Imagine that you hear a person at the check-in desk of a 
hotel snap at the receptionist. Perhaps you attribute that behaviour to her per­
sonality – she’s just a rude person. Or, noticing the tags on her baggage, you 
put it down to her jetlag – tiredness sapped her patience.
Buttering up the public
Johnny Rotten was the face of angry, disaf­
fected youth in 1970s’ Britain. He was the lead 
singer of the Sex Pistols, the band that defined 
punk with hits such as ‘Anarchy in the UK’ with 
its chorus ‘I am the Anti-Christ’. The band mem­
bers spat at their audience from the stage and 
most concerts ended in violence. Deliberately 
provocative, they released an anti-monarchist 
song, ‘God Save the Queen’, on the day of the 
Queen’s Silver Jubilee in 1977. A newspaper 
organised a campaign against the record and 
workers at the record factory went on strike 
rather than produce copies.
So, how do people think of Johnny Rotten in the 
UK today? A musician who influenced a gen­
eration? A violent yob who helped make society 
nastier? How about: dairy-product connois­
seur? Bizarrely, when a butter manufacturer 
wanted to increase its sales a few years ago, 
the firm chose the elderly Johnny Rotten as the 
face of the advertising campaign. This particu­
lar product is sold on the virtues of being old 
fashioned and traditionally English – precisely 
the things that Johnny Rotten, now John Lydon, 
railed against in his youth. Surely he was the 
worst person to represent this butter. But the 
campaign was successful with sales rising by 
an astonishing 85 per cent.
To help explain Lydon’s magical power to sell 
butter, put yourself in the shoes of people 
watching his butter commercial for the first 
time. The sheer strangeness of the face of punk 
advertising dairy produce surely demands an 
explanation. What reason made Johnny Rotten 
of all people agree to appear in this advert?
In other words, what attributions did viewers 
make about his behaviour: perhaps that a sig­
nificant amount of money explained his actions? 
After all, he cheerfully told anyone who’d listen 
that he did the advertisement purely to fund 
a tour with his band. Instead, people ignored 
this explanation and made the error of attribut­
ing his actions to the fact that he must really 
like that butter. Indeed, because he was once 
Johnny Rotten and hated all things establish­
ment, he must really, really like that traditional 
butter to agree to make the advert.
In other words, the crazy unsuitability of Johnny 
Rotten as a spokesperson for traditional butter 
is precisely what makes him such a persuasive 
force. This strange result certainly runs counter 
to common sense, but you can’t argue with an 
85 per cent increase in sales.

 Chapter 9: Attributing Causes to People’s Behaviour
In the context of attributions, social psychologists aren’t really interested 
in why the woman acted as she did. Instead, as we see in this section, they 
are interested in when, how and why the people watching her make their 
attributions.
Understanding when you tend 
to make attributions
)>>
You don’t explain everything about other people’s behaviour; that would be 
exhausting. Imagine wondering why someone chose a certain outfit that day, 
why she picked a certain coffee flavour, why she stopped to check her phone 
before crossing the road, or why she got so angry at the amateur psychologist 
stalking her and asking questions about her every move. Like everyone else, 
you generate attributions only for particular types of behaviour at particular 
times. Often, you try and explain someone’s actions when the behaviour is 
unusual or unique: if it’s surprising, negative or uncharacteristic, the action 
needs an explanation.
If you see a person wearing a green top hat while walking down the street, 
that behaviour calls out for an explanation. If the behaviour seems unchar­
acteristic – if the person is otherwise dressed soberly in a suit and tie – you 
seek an attribution. Plus, if the behaviour is in anyway negative – if the 
person is being loud and boisterous – you may well ask yourself why.
But if it’s St Patrick’s Day and everyone else is dressed that way and singing 
and dancing, you probably don’t seek an attribution to explain the behaviour 
of this individual.
Deciding between a ‘bad’ person or 
a ‘bad’ situation
In this chapter I’m concerned with two broad methods of making attributions 
for behaviour that often cause errors:
)>>
✓)>>Dispositional attributions: These appraise the cause of an action to be 
internal to the person, such as personality or mood. These attributions 
explain behaviour by saying something about the inherent qualities of 
a person. So, believing that someone is shouting on the street because 
he’s an angry person is a dispositional attribution.
www.it-ebooks.info

138
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
)>>
✓)>>Situational attributions: These involve causes that are external to the 
person, such as the situation, recent experiences or the behaviour of 
other people. If you say that someone’s shouting on the street because 
he’s just received a parking ticket, that’s a situational attribution.
These two types of attributions aren’t just of academic interest, because 
they’re hugely important to people’s lives and to society. Serious problems 
can arise when people attribute actions to the wrong cause.
For instance, many legal arguments come down to the same basic question of 
attributions. In a murder trial, for example, the jury members ask themselves 
whether the accused was responsible for the crime or something about the 
situation caused that person to do it. In many cases, if a situational element is 
proved – such as a medication impairing someone’s judgement or the accused 
being provoked by others – punishment can be reduced or even removed. 
The killer of Harvey Milk in the US, for example, was released after his defence 
contended that the additives in a snack food had clouded his mind.
Falling Prey to the Fundamental 
Attribution Error
)>>
The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is a common mistake people make 
when explaining someone’s behaviour: they make a dispositional attribution 
when they should make a situational one (for definitions of these two attribu­
tions, check out the earlier section ‘Deciding between a ‘bad’ person or a ‘bad’ 
situation’).
In this section I describe how researchers discovered the effect that became 
known as the FAE (as so often with great discoveries, it was by accident), 
how they demonstrate it through experiments and how you can find out how 
to spot yourself making the same error.
Seeing Jones and Smith’s 
surprising discovery
Early social psychologists were very interested in the process by which 
people generated explanations for each other’s behaviour. They performed 
some clever experiments to investigate this processes, and in doing so 
stumbled upon what seemed like a surprising and stubborn error in people’s 
reasoning.
www.it-ebooks.info

139
 Chapter 9: Attributing Causes to People’s Behaviour
Jones and Smith wanted to understand how people make dispositional attri­
butions (those that comment on the person rather than the situation) about 
attitudes. In their experiment, they asked one group of people if they were for or 
against Fidel Castro, and then asked the members to write an essay supporting 
their views. (This experiment was conducted in the US in the 1960s when Castro 
was a highly controversial figure.) Another group of people read these essays 
and then rated how much they thought that the writer was for or against Castro.
Unsurprisingly, people who read an essay in support of Castro attributed the 
disposition to the writer that the person was pro-Castro. But the research­
ers realised that they needed a baseline condition ‒ scores to compare with 
these ratings. So they recruited another group of raters and told them that the 
essay writers had been instructed at random to write an essay for or against 
Castro. Since the raters thought that the writers had been told what opinions 
to express, the researchers thought that the raters wouldn’t have any beliefs 
about the writers’ true opinion. But that’s not how the raters behaved.
In this control condition, the raters still said that the essays expressing the 
pro-Castro viewpoint were probably written by people who were pro-Castro. 
The researchers made doubly sure that the raters understood that they’d 
been instructed to express those views. But still the raters tended to make a 
dispositional attribution, preferring to conclude that the essay was a result 
of how the writers really felt, instead of a situational attribution that it was 
because they’d been told to do so. Clearly, the power of the situation is pretty 
strong (something I examine more in Chapter 11).
Smith and Jones had discovered an error in people’s thinking that they 
termed the ‘correspondence bias’, though it is perhaps better known by a 
later term, the fundamental attribution error.
Also known as the correspondence bias
The fundamental attribution error has another 
name: the correspondence bias. The terms 
are used interchangeably in social psychology 
literature. Some psychologists thought that 
‘fundamental attribution error’ was a little too 
extreme as a label, because behaviour can be 
attributed to personality to some degree.
So some scientists proposed that the ‘corre­
spondence bias’ better captured this graded 
aspect. In other words, people have a bias to 
think that behaviour corresponds to disposi­
tions or personality, rather than the situation. 
This term didn’t completely catch on, how­
ever, and so you still encounter the use of the 
fundamental attribution error in papers and 
textbooks.

140
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Revealing the FAE through experiments 
and experience
The strange bias that Jones and Smith uncovered was the focus of several 
experiments, as psychologists tried to understand how and why people make 
the fundamental attribution error.
In the most famous example of an experimental demonstration of FAE, Lee 
Ross and his colleagues asked participants to take part in a quiz bowl demon­
stration. They chose two participants from a larger group. In front of every­
one, they tossed a coin, making one person the questioner and the other the 
contestant. The questioner was told to think of several general-knowledge 
questions that would be difficult to answer. Then, the questioner asked the 
contestant the questions in front of all the other participants. Typically, the 
contestant did poorly on this test and the questioner had to tell the person 
the right answers.
The researchers then asked the audience members to rate the intelligence of 
the questioner and the contestant. Remarkably, they ranked the contestant 
below the questioner. At this point the contestant – as you may expect – 
objected that this test was really unfair: of course the questioner knew the 
answers to all the questions – she’d selected them!
)>>
But the audience members, the real participants in this experiment, were 
liable to make the FAE. They overlooked the situational attribution for the con­
testants’ poor performance: the fact that they didn’t come up with the ques­
tions. Instead, they leapt to a dispositional attribution: the contestant is just 
not as bright as the questioner.
In the same way as in the quiz bowl experiment, students in my lectures form 
opinions of me. Each week they see me talk for an hour or more, without 
notes, on complex topics that are just beyond their understanding, answer­
ing any question that arises. They may leap to a dispositional attribution and 
think that my performance is a great display of intelligence and that I can talk 
about anything.
But that attribution overlooks all the complex situational forces producing 
that lecture. For example, the facts that I choose to lecture only on topics 
that I know about and that I know they don’t; that I can see my notes on 
my laptop; and that – for all they know – I may have looked up this stuff on 
Wikipedia moments before the class.

 Chapter 9: Attributing Causes to People’s Behaviour
When I started as a lecturer, I was daunted at the task of putting together 
25 hours of spoken material that covered the whole discipline of psychology. 
A senior colleague reassured me, ‘You only have to make sure that you’re five 
pages ahead of the students in the textbook and they assume you know it all!’ 
Of course, I try not to use this particular example in my lectures!
Identifying the signs of the FAE
When you understand it, you start to see the FAE everywhere. You can think 
of it as the bias people have towards thinking about personalities rather than 
situations. For example, say a politician announces that she’s cutting welfare 
payments to the unemployed. You may be tempted to leap to the conclusion 
that she hates poor people instead of considering the complicated web of 
economic forecasts, political deals and ideological promises that produced 
that policy.
)>>
When people win, for example at sports, people also often make the FAE, 
leaping to the attribution that they succeeded because of their special dis­
positions – their inborn talent. But that overlooks their years of practice and 
training, and the technical resources and expert coaching from which they’ve 
benefited. (Though I don’t call it by this name, you can see the FAE at work 
in Chapter 7 in the discussion about how parents understand their children’s 
successes and failures.)
Stephen Fry isn’t as clever as you think
When asked to name a highly intelligent person, 
many British people say Stephen Fry. He hosts 
an erudite and witty television quiz show 
called QI that rewards pedantic and obscure 
knowledge (it’s much more entertaining than it 
sounds). After watching him supply the Greek 
etymology of a technical term in microbiology, 
and then segue into a discussion of musical 
leitmotifs in the works of Shostakovich and 
ABBA, viewers are tempted to conclude that 
Stephen Fry knows everything about every­
thing. But they’d be making the FAE. Viewers 
often overlook that a team of researchers look 
up this information each week. They write it on 
the teleprompter in front of Fry and whisper it 
into his earpiece.
Stephen Fry and other TV quiz masters don’t 
pretend for a moment that they’re the source 
of all the knowledge they dispense: many read 
off cards that they hold visibly in front of them. 
Yet the FAE persists in the minds of the view­
ers, and TV quiz masters continue to be named 
routinely as highly intelligent people.
So if you want to be seen as exceptionally 
smart, get a hard-working group of assistants 
and an autocue!

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
You can also think of the FAE as the mistake of thinking that a strongly influ­
ential situation is a weak one. In Chapter 12, I talk about Milgram’s disturb­
ing experiments in which he put participants in a situation where they were 
asked to press a button that would cause an innocent person immense pain. 
When he first presented these experiments to other psychologists, Milgram 
asked them to guess how many participants would obey the instructions. 
Typically, they guessed around 5 per cent of people. In reality, over 65 per cent 
of the participants obeyed.
)>>
Just like members of the public, these professional psychologists (who you 
may think should know better) made the fundamental attribution error. They 
thought that the situation would have only a weak influence on the partici­
pants’ behaviour, reasoning that participants’ dispositions – their good sense 
and kindness – would stop them from hurting another person. But no.
In Chapters 11 and 12, I seek to understand more about the complicated 
causal power of the situation that compels such behaviour.
Taking the simple route to 
explaining behaviour
You may be wondering why people prefer to prioritise internal dispositions 
over external situations when seeking causes to explain behaviour. One 
answer is simplicity.
Thinking of an internal cause for a person’s behaviour is easy – the strict 
teacher is a mean person, the doting parents just love their kids. In contrast, 
situational explanations can be complex and murky. Perhaps the teacher 
appears mean because she’s seen the consequences of not trying hard in 
generations of students and wants to instil self-discipline in them. Perhaps 
the parents who’re boasting of the achievements of their children are anxious 
about their failures, and conscious of the cost of their school fees. These situ­
ational factors require knowledge, insight and time to think through. Jumping 
to a dispositional attribution is far easier.
You can see the same thing happening when people make attributions about 
simple objects. Richard Nisbett and colleagues showed participants a video 
of a wood chip, caught in the eddies and currents of a fast-moving stream, 
bobbing weaving. They asked people what was happening in the video. 
Participants were likely to talk about the wood chip and its dispositions, how 
it ‘wanted’ to move around or stay near the rock (even though clearly a wood 
chip can’t ‘decide’ or ‘want’ anything). Fewer people saw and told the more 
complicated story about the currents of water and how they interacted with 
each other and the rocks to move the chip.

Often, people seek a simple story of dispositions over a complex story about 
the situation.
Living with the consequences of the FAE
Ignorance of the FAE causes all sorts of consequences, some serious and 
others less so. I discuss just two in this section.
Picturing the truth about celebrity life
Celebrity ‘journalism’ is a strange and twisted world, one that mostly profits 
the celebrities and the journalists, of course. Has so much ever been printed 
about so little!
)>>
The fundamental attribution error is the engine driving all these stories, par­
ticularly the pictures. It nudges you to overlook the real circumstances of 
these isolated, selected and re-touched images and generates the belief that 
you’re getting to know these people.
)>>
You probably feel that you know something about the celebrities on your 
screens. You know what Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton are like. You’ve seen pic­
tures of them grinning, going into a club with other celebrities they may or 
may not be having an affair with. You’ve seen the shots of them tear-stained at 
the airport after being jilted once more.
But when you look at these paparazzi shots, you’re being goaded into making 
the fundamental attribution error. You seek an explanation for why, say, they 
look angry and attribute it to their dispositions: they must have an explosive 
temper. You disregard the situation around that photograph ‒ that the celeb­
rity was being followed all day by a pack of paparazzi. She asked patiently to 
be left alone but was still snapped with long-range lenses inside her own home. 
Finally she tried to leave the photographers behind by driving off, but was 
tailed by photographers on motorbikes looking in through the car windows. As 
she’s getting out of the car, a flash goes off into her eyes and angrily she yells 
at the photographer. Someone takes a picture of that reaction, prints it in the 
magazine and the readers think, ‘Ah, there’s that famous temper again.’
In fact, the process that goes on at such magazines can be even more aston­
ishing. One editor explained how she once covered a story about the actress 
Jennifer Aniston. Her ex-husband, Brad Pitt, had that week adopted a baby 
with his new partner, Angelina Jolie. The editorial team sat around discuss­
ing how Jennifer must feel about that. Then they looked through the stack 
of photographs sent to them by the paparazzi following her that day. It was 
a set of shots of Jennifer getting a coffee and leaving. The editors decided 
www.it-ebooks.info

144
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
that she’d probably be very upset about what ‘Brangelina’ had done. So they 
found a picture where Aniston looked upset – or was just squinting into the 
sun, coming out of the café – and printed it with the headline ‘Jennifer in 
tears over new Dad Brad’.
Dying due to the FAE
People’s bias to choose simple dispositional attributions over complex situ­
ational attributions can have extremely serious consequences. After the 
September 11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001, President George W. Bush 
made this statement about the instigator, Osama Bin Laden: ‘The only thing 
I know for certain about him is that he’s evil.’ He stated, essentially, that the 
reason for the September 11 attack was the disposition of one man.
At the time, some people began asking complex questions about the situ­
ational forces: why do these people hate the US? What do they hope to 
gain from a terrorist attack? But many mainstream politicians and leaders 
condemned this discussion, saying that acknowledging the possibility that 
the actions of the US were part of the casual chain that led to the attack 
was unpatriotic. So, pushed by the fundamental attribution error, the story 
told about September 11 became one of dispositions – villains and heroes – 
rather than a complex history of political forces and a nation’s foreign policy. 
Arguably, this simple story led to some very bad consequences for every­
one involved when the US and its allies took military action in response to 
September 11.
Digging Deeper into the FAE
The fundamental attribution error isn’t a consistent, stable tendency. Not all 
people make the error to the same degree: differences in the strength of the 
bias apply across different cultures; subtle differences in how questions are 
asked can shift the attributions you make; and most people make the FAE dif­
ferently when thinking about themselves versus others.
Experiencing differences across the world
Countries such as the USA and most of Europe have what psychologists call 
individualistic cultures. These people have a strong tendency to make the 
FAE – it was where the effect was first observed. But researchers have found 
that people from collectivist cultures, such as China and Japan, have a reduced 
tendency to make the FAE. They’re happier to make situational attributions 
for other people’s behaviour.
www.it-ebooks.info

145
 Chapter 9: Attributing Causes to People’s Behaviour
Also, Richard Nisbett found with his wood-chip experiment (see the earlier 
section ‘Taking the simple route to explaining behaviour’) that people from 
collectivist cultures more readily describe the behaviour of a wood chip in 
a babbling stream in terms of the interaction between water currents, rocks 
and the chip itself. They have a broader tendency to seek explanations that 
don’t focus on individual entities and their dispositions. I discuss this idea in 
much more detail in Chapter 17. One explanation is that people from different 
cultures have different perspectives on people’s behaviour, as I discuss next.
Appreciating the role of perspective
The perspective that you take in a situation can change the attributions 
that you make. By ‘perspective’ I mean literal, visual perspective, as well as 
a more metaphoric sense of thinking about someone’s behaviour in differ­
ent contexts, with different knowledge of the background reasons for their 
actions.
)>>
Imagine that you look across a café at two people arguing. The situation is not 
at all obvious. You don’t know what led up to that argument or who said what 
to whom. All you can see are two angry faces. Unsurprisingly, you explain 
their behaviour in terms of their visible, salient characteristics: they’re two 
very angry people (that is, you make a dispositional attribution).
But now imagine that you’re in that situation, having an argument. You know 
exactly what was said in the car park before you entered the café and how it 
dredged up an unresolved argument from weeks before that had been sim­
mering ever since. You know that you’re on a diet today and hunger is making 
you cranky, and that your partner deliberately ordered a caramel latte know­
ing that you were unable to have one. All these situational forces are highly 
salient to you.
In contrast, your dispositions aren’t obvious. Unless you’re sitting by a 
mirror, you may not realise that you’re scowling at the latte. You may not 
know that your voice is raised. In this case, you quite sensibly attribute your 
actions to the situational forces that you can directly experience, as opposed 
to the dispositions.
Researchers have recreated this contrast in perspective in the laboratory. 
They asked two people to have an argument and filmed them from different 
cameras. One was placed in the corner of the room, filming both people. 
The other was placed just over the shoulder of one person, filming from his 
perspective.
www.it-ebooks.info

146
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
They showed the footage from one camera or another to participants, and 
asked them to explain the behaviour they saw. If they were watching from the 
vantage point of across the room, people made the typical FAE dispositional 
attributions. But when they watched the footage from the point of view of 
one person, they were more likely to attribute that person’s actions to the 
situation. In other words, a simple switch in visual perspective produced 
an actor-observer like bias, even though the participants were never talking 
about themselves.
Noticing the actor-observer bias
Social psychologists have found that people tend to make the FAE more 
about other people than about themselves: something that’s called the actor-
observer bias. In other words, compared to how often you explain other 
people’s actions in terms of their dispositions, you’re much more likely to 
consider the situation and your dispositions when thinking about yourself 
(and not simply because you’re trying to avoid any blame!). Given that in 
such cases you’re in possession of more facts, perhaps this tendency is 
unsurprising.
)>>
People vary in their responses when placed in difficult moral situations. Try 
this exercise in moral reasoning and see how well you can predict your own 
actions. For each of the actions below please write down ‘yes’ if think you’d 
do them, ‘no’ if you think that you wouldn’t and ‘depends’ if you think that you 
might or might not, depending on the situation:
)>>
✓)>>Borrow money from your parents without asking first.
)>>
✓)>>As a student, use an essay from a friend in the year above who took the 
same class.
)>>
✓)>>Become romantically involved with someone who was still in another 
relationship.
)>>
✓)>>Read an email that someone has left open on a public computer.
)>>
✓)>>Object when another customer mutters a racist remark about a member 
of staff.
)>>
✓)>>Intervene when you see a young child vandalising some public property.
Now go back over the list again, but this time answer the questions on behalf 
of a close friend. Write down whether you think ‘yes’ that person would carry 
out that action, or ‘no’ or it ‘depends’.
www.it-ebooks.info

147
 Chapter 9: Attributing Causes to People’s Behaviour
You may or may not think that you are more honest and upstanding than 
your friends (my bet is it’s the former, given the positive illusions that you 
harbour towards yourself, as I showed in Chapter 8). But here, I’m not so 
much interested in what moral choices you made, so much as whether or not 
you make them in terms of the situation (and answered ‘depends’) or your 
dispositions.
To analyse your data, count up the number of ‘depends’ answers you gave for 
yourself and your friend. If you’re like most people who carry out this task, 
you have more ‘depends’ answers for yourself.
This result shows that when thinking of your own actions, you are much 
more likely to take into account more of the situation and less likely just to 
think in terms of your dispositions.
Here’s another example: researchers asked US students what made their best 
friends pick their majors at university. The students typically gave dispo­
sitional attributions, such as, ‘They want to make a lot of money after they 
graduate.’ When they asked the students why they picked their own major, 
the students still named some dispositional attributions, but compared to 
thinking about their friends they were more likely to name situational factors 
such as, ‘Engineering is a high-paying field’, or ‘My parents were really keen 
for me to study this.’
Just like the exercise in moral decision-making above, when they are think­
ing about other people the students focus on dispositions, but when thinking 
about their own actions, they focus on the situation.
)>>
People often get confused about the fundamental attribution error and the 
actor-observer bias. They try to give experimental evidence for one theory in 
support of another, or think that one is the opposite of the other. The simplest 
way to think of their relationship is that the FAE is an error that you make rea­
soning about other people, and the actor-observer bias is a difference in how 
you reason about yourself compared to other people. More precisely, the FAE 
is the mistake of attributing behaviour to a disposition rather than a situation; 
the actor-observer bias is that people are more likely to make the FAE when 
thinking about other people compared to themselves.

H

uman beings judge each other all the time. People on television, fellow 
commuters on the train and passers-by: you probably form impres­
sions and appraisals of all of them during your day. You can make these judg­
ments on the basis of very little information, as I will show you, because you 
draw on your rich knowledge and experience of meeting people in the past. 
In other words, you use social stereotypes to make judgments about how 
someone in a suit and tie may be different from someone with tattoos and a 
biker jacket. Your judgments and preconceptions can also be influenced in 
remarkably subtle ways.
Imagine that you’re attending a lecture. The event co-ordinator introduces 
the keynote speaker as follows: ‘Allow me to introduce you to the speaker for 
today. People who know him consider him a rather warm person, industrious, 
critical, practical and determined.’ You listen to the speech and afterwards 
someone asks you to appraise the speaker personally and professionally.
When Harold Kelley did an experiment like this in the 1950s with university 
students, he found that one word had a particularly powerful effect on their 
social judgements. If the word ‘warm’ was replaced with ‘cold’, the speaker 
was seen as less friendly and approachable, more irritable and self-centred. 
Though it was only one word among many hundreds spoken across the hour, 
it had a strong impact on the judgements people made.
www.it-ebooks.info

150
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
When ‘warm’ or ‘cold’ was said early on, it framed the perceptions that the 
listeners had of the speaker from that point. (Just as the exact same move­
ment of the mouth, for example, can be seen as a friendly grin or a superior 
smirk, depending on the initial framing.) Having heard a description of a lec­
turer as ‘cold’, the listeners pictured a stereotypically aloof academic living 
in an ivory tower. From then on, listeners noticed aspects of his behaviour 
that fitted into this stereotype and ignored those that didn’t.
In this chapter, I explore some remarkable things about the judgements that 
people make about each other, including the nature, formation and roles of 
stereotypes and prejudice. I reveal that the social judgements you make are 
determined as much by what’s already in your head as by what’s in front of 
your eyes.
)>>
The experiments and theories that I describe in this chapter are part of the 
cognitive approach of understanding social stereotypes, prejudice and group 
difference, which emphasises how social information is learnt and organised 
into concepts. (This approach isn’t the only way to examine these subjects, 
and in Chapter 16 I talk about the motivational and economic approaches.) 
The cognitive approach reveals the many ways that stereotypes have of per­
petuating themselves in society. This insight makes it all the more important, 
and all the more difficult, to figure out when useful generalisations slide into 
prejudice.
Staring at Stereotypes and 
Peering at Prejudice
A stereotype is usually a bad thing. The tough, alcoholic cop who doesn’t 
play by the rules is yelled at by his boss and divorced by his wife, but he 
always gets the bad guy: that’s a stereotype, and it’s bad writing. Not all cops 
are like that. Or if someone says to you, ‘Here’s my new boyfriend, he’s a city 
trader,’ and you look up expecting to meet a boorish, slick-haired man in a 
suit and red braces, who boasts endlessly about his new Porsche and his 
admiration for right-wing politicians: that’s a stereotype, and it’s judgemental. 
Not all city traders are like that. For example, I once met a city trader who 
wore black braces!
In this section I discuss the two sides of stereotypes, their usefulness and 
their dangers .Stereotypes can be very useful as they are a form of mental 
short cut, allowing us to make accurate and efficient assumptions. If you 
assume that the 4-year-old girl you are talking to can’t read, for example, 
that’s a stereotype. You may not be correct, but there is a pretty good chance 
www.it-ebooks.info

151
 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
you are, and if you make this assumptions you won’t waste time asking her 
what her favourite novels are. You may also assume that since she’s a little 
girl she won’t like playing with Lego. This again is a stereotype that may not 
be true at all. The danger here is that by only offering her dolls to play with, 
rather than construction toys, you are sending signals about activities that 
girls can and cannot do. For example, the Lego company finally released a 
female mini-figure who was a scientist only in 2014 due to popular demand.
Recognising that stereotypes 
are just categories
When people talk of stereotypes, they’re usually accusing someone of being 
prejudiced in some way. If you assume that a woman is bad at parallel park­
ing or a man can’t do two things at once, you’re drawing on a stereotype and 
applying it in a prejudicial way. If you assume that all Black people are good 
at sports and all Asian people are studious, again you’re drawing on a stereo­
type and making racist assumptions.
)>>
But stereotypes in themselves aren’t bad things. In fact, they’re a vital part 
of how your brain understands the world. Stereotypes are simply categories 
or concepts of different types of people. From birth onwards, you perceive 
the world in terms of concepts. Perceiving is categorising, and as I reveal in 
Chapter 16 people are inveterate organisers.
When a baby sees a hairy creature with four legs and hears it bark, those 
two perceptions are associated. When she next sees the hairy thing with 
four legs, she may expect to hear a bark again. Though it may be a few more 
months before she learns the word, the baby is slowly forming a concept of 
a ‘dog’, and soon she fills that concept with all sorts of dog knowledge and 
experiences.
This assessment is a very smart thing for a baby to do, because when she 
encounters a new similar-looking hairy thing with four legs she can apply that 
concept. So even though she’s never met this particular animal before, she 
already knows that it may bark, lick her face and probably fetch a toy that 
she throws for it. Her conceptual – or stereotypical – assumptions about dogs 
are a vital part of her understanding of the world. They may not be true of 
every dog the baby meets: some don’t bark and some look at a tossed stick 
with disdain. But the assumptions are true of enough dogs that the stereo­
type is useful.

152
Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
)>>
The key point about concepts and stereotypes is that they’re cognitively 
useful. You may think that a world without stereotypes would be a wondrous, 
egalitarian and tolerant place. True, it would have no racism or sexism, but 
people would also waste a lot of time getting to know everyone as individu­
als. Imagine having to ask a 10-year-old whether he’s married or checking to 
see whether an adult working behind the library counter can read. Sometimes 
making assumptions is convenient and useful, and that’s all stereotypes are.
Understanding that categorisation 
can become prejudice
At some point useful generalisations from stereotypes can turn into preju­
dice. Exactly when something changes from a useful generalisation to a 
(potentially offensive) stereotype is argued over, revised and disputed in our 
society. If you’re walking down a dark alley late at night and a male teenager 
in a hoodie starts following close behind, you may feel nervous and clutch 
your wallet. You wouldn’t do this if it was an elderly lady, perhaps. That 
seems like a reasonable distinction. You’re drawing on your stereotypically 
knowledge that old ladies are rarely muggers. You’re playing the odds, so 
to speak.
But what if you clutch your wallet tighter still if the teenager is black? Now, 
that reaction seems racist. But many police forces across the world stop and 
search young people of ethnic minorities and use the same argument as justi­
fication: the statistics, they say, suggest that people of those groups are more 
likely to commit crimes, and so they’re simply playing the odds.
Here’s another example. My local supermarket divides children’s toys into a 
shelf for boys and a shelf for girls. Because you have rich knowledge about 
boy and girl stereotypes, you can probably imagine that the boys’ shelf is full 
of weapons and sports equipment, and the girls’ shelf is a pink and sparkly 
smear of dolls, dress-up toys and big-eyed cuddly animals.
When shopping for my 6-year-old twins, I was annoyed when I saw that the 
cooking set I wanted for my son was on the ‘girls’ shelf and the science kit 
I wanted for my daughter was on the ‘boys’ shelf. I emailed the supermarket 
and said that this was blatantly sexist. Who is it to say that girls should do 
the cooking and only boys be scientists?
The supermarket replied that it isn’t being sexist at all; it’s just trying to help 
customers. Most boys like guns and action toys and most girls like dolls and 
make-believe toys, it claims. So dividing the toys up accordingly makes sense. 
www.it-ebooks.info

153
 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
In effect, it’s making the point that stereotypes are useful things that reflect 
the way the world is. Just like most (but not all) dogs bite, most (but not all) 
girls like dolls and pink toys.
)>>
But the supermarket that sorts toys by gender and the police force that stops 
and searches on the basis of ethnicity are missing an important point. Dogs 
don’t much care what your concept of a ‘dog’ is, but people are very sensi­
tive to how they’re categorised. Stopping and searching people on the basis 
of their ethnicity induces a climate of fear and distrust; and if you sort toys 
by gender, of course girls prefer dolls, because that’s the only type of toy that 
they’re given to play with. Instead of passively reflecting an existing reality 
about the world, such practices are actively creating one.
Creating and Sustaining Stereotypes
A stereotype is simply a concept about a type of person. Here are just some 
of the many things on which people base stereotypes:
)>>
✓)>>Appearance: For example, blondes are stupid.
)>>
✓)>>Gender: For example, men love football and women love soap operas.
)>>
✓)>>Jobs: For example, lawyers are greedy.
)>>
✓)>>Nationality: For example, English people are snobs.
If humans are good at one thing it’s categorising people and making assump­
tions about them. If you and a friend describe your stereotypical professional 
footballer, classical pianist, Italian housewife or Canadian lumberjack, I bet 
that you mention at least 80 per cent of the same attributes.
In this section I describe where all this rich, detailed information comes from, 
why certain people share the same stereotypes and how people maintain a 
stereotype even when it’s confounded by reality (such as meeting a female 
Canadian lumberjack who doesn’t conform to the stereotype). I bust a couple 
of popular myths along the way.
Tracking stereotypes back to their source
Some experts say that humans learn stereotypes from carefully observing 
the world. People notice patterns in the social world around them: teenagers 
are often surly, older people are more conservative, golf players are wealthy 
and vegetarians are usually politically liberal. As I discuss in Chapter 5, your 
brain is like a sponge that soaks up these sorts of associations.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
)>>
But although stereotypes are made up partly of everything people notice and 
experience, it’s by no means the full story. Stereotypes consist of more than 
objective observations. Unfortunately, although people are very good at notic­
ing patterns in the social world, they’re also highly adept at seeing things that 
aren’t there. I mean that people jump to conclusions, see non-existent correla­
tions and ignore evidence that contradicts their beliefs. (For more on biases in 
social judgements, jump to the following section.)
In addition to the things you see, or think you see, in the surrounding real 
world, you also obtain social information from the imagined world of books, 
television and films. For example, few people have had extensive contact with 
the police, such as crime scene investigators or criminal profilers. But thanks 
to the television shows that clog up the channels, I bet that you have a rich 
set of stereotypes about the sorts of people working in those jobs.
Revealing biases in social judgements
Many people are convinced that solid, physical differences exist between 
women’s and men’s brains, and that this difference explains and justifies the 
different sorts of jobs and responsibilities that men and women tend to have 
in our society.
Recently, a paper was published claiming that men’s and women’s brains are 
different. The neuroscientists looked at the connections between different 
areas of the brain. They claimed that women’s brains have more interconnec­
tions between the areas, which is why women are better at multitasking and 
holistic thinking (that is, taking all aspects into consideration). In contrast, 
the claim goes, male brains are less interconnected, which means that men 
were better at focusing on single tasks such as spatial reasoning and logical 
thinking. The researchers concluded, in the many newspaper articles about 
their work, that the difference between men’s and women’s thinking is hard­
wired in the brain.
)>>
Except that it’s not and many other neuroscientists are appalled at these 
claims. Importantly, in addition to scanning their brains, the researchers gave 
their participants many different tests of spatial reasoning, emotional process­
ing, multitasking and so on. They didn’t find differences between the sexes in 
the majority of these tests, and in the ones where they did find a difference it 
was very small. Of course, they didn’t mention this fact in the interviews with 
the media, but instead talked about the ‘well-known differences’ between how 
men and women think.
For additional objections to this research, read the nearby sidebar ‘Mine’s 
bigger than yours’.
www.it-ebooks.info

155
 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
The remarkable thing is how readily the media accepted and trumpeted the 
claims of the researchers. Not because the data was so strong (in fact, very 
good reasons exist to doubt it) but because the conclusions were sold as sup­
port for the existing stereotypes that people have for men and women.
)>>
In fact, the paper is very poor evidence for gender differences in thinking, but 
excellent evidence for biases in social judgements.
Proving what you already know: 
Confirmation bias
)>>
People pay attention to information that supports their beliefs and ignore 
information that contradicts them. This confirmation bias feeds the habit of 
stereotyping people. Because stereotypes guide perception and cause people 
to label those they meet, stereotypes have a self-perpetuating nature and can 
be extremely resistant to change.
Imagine that you have the stereotype that gay men are flamboyant and effem­
inate. Each time you meet a man who’s very camp, or see one on television, 
you think, ‘There’s another one.’ From your perspective, you have a lot of 
positive evidence for this generalisation and your stereotype is proved right 
time and time again.
But you don’t pay attention to all the gay men who aren’t flamboyant and 
effeminate. According to your stereotype, you simply assume that these men 
are straight. Because your stereotype guides and labels your perception, you 
find confirmation of it everywhere and are blind to conflicting evidence.
Mine’s bigger than yours
Many problems and limitations apply to the 
technique that the researchers used to examine 
the connections in men’s and women’s brains. 
Plus, the differences are very small indeed; 
much, much smaller than the average differ­
ence in height between the sexes, for example. 
Indeed, the very small difference in connectiv­
ity is probably mostly due to the fact that men 
are simply that little bit larger than women, not 
that their brains are fundamentally wired in a 
different way.

Coming to wrong conclusions: 
Illusory correlations
People and events that are unusual tend to attract your attention and stick 
in the memory better than the everyday or commonplace. Memory and per­
ception work that way. This bias has consequences for social perception: it 
means that people are more likely to notice others’ ethnicity, for example, 
when they’re a member of a minority group and more likely to notice their 
behaviour when it’s unusual.
For example, say you’re in a pub and you see a Croatian football supporter 
starting a fight. You haven’t met many Croatians before and the event is 
unusual, and so you take note. Because you place an emphasis on those two 
facts, you’re more likely to spot an illusionary correlation (a false connection 
or relationship) between them. As a result you come to the conclusion that 
Croatian football supporters are very aggressive people.
)>>
Your conclusion is wrong, because you don’t notice the more common 
instances where a fight starts in a pub and an English person is the aggres­
sor. Plus, you don’t spot all the times that Croatian football supporters are 
going happily about their business not bothering anyone. These sorts of 
illusory correlations can entrench pre-existing stereotypes, or can gradually 
lead to the formation of completely new stereotypes over time.
The hopeless dad stereotype
I experienced a little of the illusionary correla­
tion stereotype when my children were babies. 
In England, men taking an equal or greater 
share of responsibility for raising their children 
is still unusual. So when I went to the park with 
my infant twins, it often contained only one or 
two other dads. Inevitably, one of the twins 
would lose a toy or poke the other one in the 
eye by accident, and I found myself with a 
screaming infant in my arms. On these occa­
sions, I could see the other people in the park 
looking at me shaking their heads: another hap­
less dad clueless about babies.
This response seems doubly unfair and appears 
to involve a conflation of illusionary correlation 
and confirmation bias. The illusionary correla­
tion is that people didn’t look at mums holding 
screaming babies in the same way, because 
that event was much more common, and they 
didn’t seem to notice me when the babies were 
playing happily. But the occurrence of two 
unusual things popped out as a correlation, and 
was added as irrefutable confirmation of their 
stereotyped bias of new fathers: they knew 
they’d been right all along!

 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
Making your predictions come true: 
Self-fulfilling prophecies
When you have a certain belief, act in accordance with it and your belief is 
indeed confirmed, it’s called a self-fulfilling prophecy, which is another bias in 
behaviour that helps to perpetuate stereotypes.
)>>
Imagine that your only experience of English people comes from Downton 
Abbey or some other aristocratic period television drama. You may well have 
the stereotype that English people are very formal and proper. But then you’re 
introduced to an English person for the first time. Drawing on your Downton 
Abbey knowledge you stand stiffly to attention and say the most ornate greet­
ing you can muster: ‘Good day to you, Sir; I’m delighted to make your acquain­
tance.’ The English person – probably quite startled – mutters back a polite, 
formal reply, and in doing so, conforms exactly to your stereotype.
Similarly, if you have the stereotype that Americans are friendly and relaxed, 
you tend to smile more when you meet them. They smile back and your ste­
reotype is confirmed. If a teacher has a stereotype that girls are bad at maths, 
he may be less likely to call on them to give answers in class and less likely 
to push them with harder assignments. After several terms of this treatment, 
unsurprisingly some girls do fall behind the boys in their achievements, thus 
confirming the stereotype.
Observing Stereotypes in Action
People can have all sorts of strange and incorrect ideas about the world. 
I once met someone who thought that the new Star Wars films are better than 
the originals: crazy and clearly wrong, but not really that important.
The significance and power of stereotypes, however, is that they can directly 
shape the behaviour between two people. If I harbour a stereotype about 
you, that affects how I act towards you, how you respond and the judgements 
we make about each other. In this section I explore how stereotypes exert 
this very real influence over your social interactions.

Pressing the ‘activate stereotype’ button
You may be surprised just how quickly a stereotype can turn into an action. 
The moment that a stereotype comes to mind, it can influence your behav­
iour, literally in the blink of an eye. In the experiments I describe below, 
social psychologists investigated the stereotypes that White American par­
ticipants hold about Black Americans, and their consequences for behaviour. 
Researchers focused on these groups mainly because they were the majority 
racial group and the largest minority in the US at the time (though recently 
Hispanic and Latino groups have overtaken Black Americans in number). As 
I discussed in Chapter 5 though, it is generally true that stereotypes about a 
particular group are held by all members of society, even those to whom the 
stereotype applies. So the chances are that if these experiments were done 
with Black American participants, they would have shown similar behaviour.
In one experiment, researchers flashed pictures of Black or White faces to 
White participants very rapidly. Their job was to identify as quickly as pos­
sible the picture that followed the faces. The findings are revealing and dis­
turbing. If they’d just been flashed a picture of a Black face, participants were 
faster to recognise pictures of handguns and sports equipment – objects 
associated with the Black American stereotype.
You may wonder how concerning it is that participants take a few millisec­
onds less to recognise a basketball in one condition: is that really evidence 
of prejudice? I’m afraid so, because in a disturbing experiment, research­
ers demonstrated that these rapid effects of stereotype activation can have 
consequences.
Participants played a video game in which they had to press a button to 
shoot people who popped up pointing a gun at them. Sometimes, the person 
suddenly appearing wasn’t holding a gun, however, just an innocent object 
such as a hairdryer. The participants had to make very rapid decisions 
whether or not to fire.
The results showed that participants’ trigger fingers were influenced by the 
race of the person appearing in their crosshairs. They were more likely to 
shoot an unarmed Black person than a White person (and more likely not to 
shoot an armed White person). Clearly, in certain situations – such as those 
regularly faced by armed police – the rapid activation of stereotypes can 
have severe consequences (check out the sidebar ‘When stereotypes are 
fatal’ for some tragic cases).

 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
Taking charge of stereotypes: Automatic 
and controlled processes
Attitudes are two-faced, contradictory and confusing things, as I discuss in 
Chapters 4 and 5. People can tell you clearly and confidently that they have 
no racial prejudice, for example, and yet when psychologists ask them to sort 
words and pictures, they appear to associate good things with White people 
and bad things with Black people.
)>>
To understand what’s going on here, you need to distinguish between explicit 
attitudes, which you can state and explain to people, and implicit attitudes, 
which consist of associations between ideas, people and values. Implicit 
attitudes shape your behaviour, even though you may not be aware of them. 
Researchers have used a similar distinction to understand how stereotypes 
can influence behaviour in different ways in different people.
When you first meet someone, researchers have shown that stereotypical infor­
mation is automatically activated. When you meet someone who’s disabled, 
Russian or a lumberjack, your brain immediately activates all the concepts 
and memories associated with those social categories. Much of this knowledge 
affects the stereotypes attached to these people in society. So even if you know 
and like Russian people, a childhood spent watching James Bond movies acti­
vates all sorts of evil super-villain stereotypes.
When stereotypes are fatal
In these experiments, White participants are 
milliseconds quicker to respond to words and 
pictures relating to violence when their ste­
reotypes of Black Americans are primed. The 
same behaviour can be observed outside of 
the laboratory. In tense police situations, offi­
cers have to make the same sort of millisecond 
decisions about whether or not a suspect is 
armed, and whether they pose an immediate 
threat. Although it cannot be proved in indi­
vidual cases, psychology experiments suggest 
that a suspect’s race can play a role in such 
decisions. For example, in the UK in 2011, Mark 
Duggan, a local Black man, was shot by police 
in London who believed that he was armed and 
dangerous at the time, although later inquests 
failed to establish that he had any intention of 
firing upon them.
In the US in 1999, Amadou Diallo, an immigrant 
from West Africa, was mistaken by police offi­
cers in New York for a suspect in a violent rape 
case. The police called upon him to raise his 
arms. He reached for his wallet to show his ID, 
one officer yelled ‘Gun!’ and the unarmed man 
was shot 19 times. Sadly, such millisecond deci­
sions in ambiguous situations can have fatal 
consequences.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Psychologists know that stereotypical information is automatically activated 
in your brain because they can show that your behaviour is subtly affected. 
In one experiment, researcher Patricia Devine compared participants who 
expressed prejudiced views towards Black Americans with those who 
expressed non-prejudiced views. She flashed words to both groups of par­
ticipants so quickly that they couldn’t be consciously aware of having read 
them. In one condition, the words were associated with the stereotype of 
Black Americans. They weren’t simply negative stereotypes and, importantly, 
none of the words related to aggression. In a later task, participants were 
asked to interpret the behaviour of the character in a story.
If they’d been flashed with words associated with Black Americans, all par­
ticipants were more likely to say that the character was being aggressive, 
because that trait is also part of the stereotype. Remember, the words flashed 
on screen had said nothing about aggression at all. The participants’ own 
associations between Black Americans and aggression had been automati­
cally activated. And all participants showed the same effect to the same 
degree, no matter whether they consciously claimed prejudiced views or not.
But thankfully, even when a stereotype is automatically activated, preju­
dice doesn’t always follow. People’s minds aren’t fully on autopilot. They’re 
aware of some mental processes and are perfectly able to exert control of 
their thoughts and behaviour, if they choose to do so. It depends on the 
person and the mental control that they exert over their own thoughts and 
behaviour.
In the final part of Devine’s experiment, she asked participants to describe 
their view of Black Americans. Now the two groups of participants gave very 
different responses. Those who expressed prejudiced views gave more nega­
tive and stereotypical descriptions than the non-prejudiced participants.
)>>
The interesting aspect is that the first part of the experiment proves that 
both groups of people had the same stereotypical information lodged in 
their brains and that the same automatic process could activate it. The dif­
ference between the groups is whether they chose to use a controlled process 
to actively ignore that stereotype and avoid prejudice, or simply to express 
it. In other words, prejudice in our behaviour is sometimes due to automatic 
processes that we have little control over, and sometimes due to controlled 
processes that we can consciously influence, if we chose to do so.
This sometimes contradictory mixture of automatic and controlled processes 
was nicely illustrated in another experiment. Participants’ explicit prejudice 
was measured by a questionnaire, and their implicit prejudice measured 
by a reaction time experiment (as I review in Chapters 4 and 5). Then they 
www.it-ebooks.info

161
 Chapter 10: Making Judgements about Other People: Bias and Prejudice
interviewed a Black and a White candidate for a job. The researchers later 
watched those videos and coded them for how friendly the participants 
seemed.
Not surprisingly, the people who explicitly reported negative, prejudiced 
views towards Black people were rated as being less friendly towards them 
in the interview. But then the researchers had the videos rated for friendli­
ness again. This time, they turned the sound off, so that friendliness could 
be judged only by the subtle implicit cues of body language and expressions. 
Now how friendly the participants appeared matched up with their reaction 
time scores on the implicit measures of prejudice.
When they were sitting and chatting to the Black job candidates, participants’ 
behaviour was being pulled by two different forces. On the one hand, their 
controlled, explicit attitudes towards Black people determined how they 
spoke to them. But on the other hand, without their awareness participants’ 
implicit associations were causing their body language to be friendly or not.
Fooling yourself
Other people aren’t the only ones who can be harmed by your stereotypical 
views. As I state in Chapter 7, you’re likely to perform worse on a test if you 
have a stereotypical view that people like you aren’t supposed to be good at 
such things. Females get lower test scores on maths exams if their stereotype 
of women is activated by something as innocent as a box on the front of the 
test booklet where they indicate their gender.
)>>
Perversely, knowledge of your own stereotypes can lead to a sort of ignorance 
about yourself and others. For example, the stereotype of college students is 
of people staggering between the bar, the library and the pub, occasionally 
dragging themselves, hung-over, to lectures. But researchers discovered that 
the presence of this stereotype prevents students from realising that, actually, 
most of their friends don’t like drinking as much as that.
Here’s why. When they start college, many students are desperate to fit in 
and feel as if they belong. The stereotype is that students love booze, and so 
they tell each other how much they love drinking and getting drunk, because 
that’s a sign that they belong. Researchers call this state pluralistic ignorance. 
Privately you may have one opinion, but because you belong to a group 
that stereotypically holds the opposite view, in public you go along with the 
stereotype.

Part III: Thinking about Ourselves and Others 
Overcoming Bias and Prejudice
Stereotypes and prejudice are never going to go away: they’re simply part of 
the way that human beings’ minds perceive and organise the social world. 
Even with absolutely no differences between races and sexes and those with 
blond hair and those with black hair, people’s biased way of categorising 
each other and noticing behaviour would still generate and perpetuate all 
sorts of wrong conclusions and new stereotypes.
The good news, however, is that specific forms of prejudice are amenable to 
change. The shift in public attitudes towards same-sex marriages in the past 
few years, for example, has astonished many campaigners for equality.
Researchers used to believe the contact hypothesis, the idea that if people 
meet others from different social categories they’ll see that their stereo­
types are unfounded. Sadly, things aren’t quite that simple (as I discuss in 
Chapter 16). Throughout the world, communities live side by side but still 
maintain extremely prejudicial views about each other.
)>>
More recent research shows that key to reducing prejudice and distrust is 
people meeting on an equal footing, with equivalent social status, while having 
some form of shared, co-operative goal.
For example, one way to reduce racial prejudice on a campus is to assign 
incoming university students from different racial backgrounds as room­
mates. As new students, they’re equal in their social status and both engaged 
in the same goal of finding their way in the university. And if all else fails, they 
can at least go to the pub together, like all stereotypical students.

f you’ve ever enjoyed or suffered through reality TV series such as I’m a 
Celebrity . . . Get Me Out of Here! or Survivor, you’ve probably wondered why 
many people want to see actors, politicians or musicians commit stomach-
churning acts for the camera, such as eating live insects. The benefits for the 
person are clear: such appearances can resurrect the faded career of celebri­
ties and satisfy their desperate need for attention. But why do members of the 
general public want to see, say, a soap-opera actor forage for maggots in the 
Australian outback?
One explanation, I think, is that in these extreme situations viewers think 
that they’re getting a glimpse of the real person behind the famous name. 
In Chapter 9, I explain that people tend to make a fundamental error when 
explaining the causes of others’ behaviour, blaming internal (dispositional) 
attributions (relating to mood, personality and so on) and overlooking the 
powerful influence of the situation.
Reality TV shows exploit this illusion. You may think that you’re gaining an 
insight into the celebrity’s true personality, but in fact you’re seeing more 
and more of the effect of that situation and less and less of the celebrity’s 
true self.
In this chapter, I discuss the remarkable power that a situation can exert 
to cause people’s behaviour. As part of this aim, I look at one of the most 
famous studies in social psychology, the Stanford prison experiment, where 
situational forces pushed participants’ behaviour to distressing extremes. 
www.it-ebooks.info

166
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
I discuss the scientific and the ethical implications of the power of the situ­
ation, asking questions about how far these results can be applied to behav­
iour outside the laboratory. I also extend the discussion to examine people’s 
views of violent behaviour and whether social psychology experiments can 
help to explain actions that are so shocking people label them as ‘evil’.
Seeing How Situation Influences 
Behaviour
In a sense, most social psychology experiments demonstrate the power of 
the situation. Whenever experimental conditions give participants slightly 
different experiences that produce different behavioural outcomes, you’re 
seeing the strong influence of the situation.
Consider, for example, the experiment (from Chapter 5) in which people 
were subliminally flashed pictures of faces and people who saw Black faces 
displayed more aggression. It shows that a tiny, imperceptible difference in a 
computer display can produce actions that – if you saw them on the street – 
you’d attribute to a hostile, angry nature.
In this section I’ll show you more examples from experiments where social 
psychologists can carefully control the situation and demonstrate its power 
over people’s behaviour, from determining their reactions to racism to when 
they’ll help a stranger on the street.
Balancing the power of beliefs 
against situation
I doubt that you’re a racist. I’m pretty confident that you have a clear set of 
beliefs and attitudes about race, and if anyone suggested that you were acting 
in a racist manner, you’d be shocked. Also (perhaps more so after you’ve 
read Chapter 5 on implicit attitudes) you’ve probably got a well-tuned radar 
to identify racist behaviour in others. When you see such racism occurring, 
this disposition of yours would react quite strongly, I imagine. Well, a recent 
experiment showed that even with a strong disposition against racism, 
behaviour can be determined more by a social situation.
)>>
Imagine that you’re taking part in a psychology experiment. It hasn’t 
started yet, and the researcher leads you into a waiting room and asks you 
to fill in a survey. Another participant in the room is doing the same thing.

 Chapter 11: Appreciating the Power of the Situation
The researcher, who’s Black, thanks you and, as he leaves the room, acci­
dentally nudges the elbow of the other participant. The door closes. 
‘Stupid nigger,’ the participant mutters.
Consider the following questions:
)>>
✓)>>How do you think you’d feel in that moment?
)>>
✓)>>What would your opinion be of the other participant?
)>>
✓)>>If you were later given a choice to work with him or another person, 
whom would you choose?
My guess is that (like people asked to picture this scenario) you think that 
you’d feel shocked and upset on hearing the use of a highly offensive racial 
term. You’d predict that your opinion of the person would plummet and 
you’d rather work with anyone else given the choice.
But those participants, and probably you too, would be quite wrong. They 
wouldn’t have the thoughts and opinions they predicted, they wouldn’t 
behave how they imagined at all. How can I claim to know better than 
you how you’d think and behave? Thanks to a very clever and surprising 
experiment
Researchers took two groups of White American participants in New York, 
and asked one group to imagine how they’d act in this scenario, as you’ve 
just done. Then they took the second group of participants and placed them 
in that exact situation. They measured how people felt after the incident, 
asked them to rate the other participants and were later given the choice to 
work with that participant or someone else. They compared three situations: 
where the other participant said nothing after being nudged; said something 
racist; and used the extremely racist n-word.
)>>
Astonishingly, the people who witnessed the racist behaviour didn’t seem at 
all bothered by it. The other participants imagined that they’d feel outrage, 
but the people in the room didn’t report feeling any different. They ranked the 
other participant the same if he stayed silent or used derogatory, racist slurs. 
Remarkably, even when they heard him use one of the most offensive words in 
American culture, they were just as likely to want to work with him later.
Perhaps the people didn’t react when they heard the racist remark because 
certain expectations and implicit rules govern behaviour in social situations. 
I talk much more about them in Chapter 13, but they ensure that people are 
(usually) polite and obliging to each other. These situational constraints 
influence behaviour. Yet, people have apparent strong dispositions against 
racism. Most people say that they find racism abhorrent and imagine that 
www.it-ebooks.info

168
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
they’d react very strongly against anyone using the n-word. But in actual fact, 
all those dispositions are overpowered by the (seemingly) weak situational 
constraints of interacting with another person.
)>>
This experiment has many important implications for how people deal with 
the important problem of racism in society. But here, I use it to illustrate how 
powerfully the situation can influence behaviour and to reveal that even a 
strong disposition can be swamped by a weak situation.
Interpreting the situation: Bystander 
intervention
Saying that the situation influences behaviour isn’t, however, the whole story. 
How individuals interpret the situation also determines their behaviour. Some 
elegant experiments show that the same situation can be interpreted in differ­
ent ways, with very different consequences for behaviour.
)>>
Imagine that you’re on the Underground late at night. Opposite you slumps a 
scruffily dressed old man. You notice that his knuckles are scuffed and raw, 
presumably from fighting. Emerging from his overcoat are an empty whiskey 
bottle and several unpleasant smells. You notice that he has started to drool 
and his breathing is laboured. Then his face turns red and he starts to wheeze 
uncontrollably. Do you do something? Is this a medical emergency, or just a 
drunk on the train?
Here’s the key question. When would you be more likely to help – when 
you’re surrounded by other travellers or when you’re alone with the poten­
tially drunk, possibly violent man in an empty train carriage?
)>>
Perhaps counter-intuitively, research suggests that if many people are pres­
ent when someone may need assistance, this makes it less likely that anyone 
will help. When many people are in the carriage, they see everyone else doing 
nothing and take that as an indication that the old man is okay and has just 
over-indulged. But if alone, they’re far more likely to intervene and offer help.
In a series of experiments, researchers put people in a similarly ambiguous 
situation to see how they’d react. Participants were led to a waiting room 
and asked to fill in a survey before the ‘real experiment’ began (an old trick 
of social psychologists). The researchers varied the number of people who 
were in the room with the participant. They had people alone in the room or 
had several others also present.
www.it-ebooks.info

169
 Chapter 11: Appreciating the Power of the Situation
Participants didn’t notice at first, but while they filled in the survey smoke 
began seeping into the room. When they noticed it, how do you think they’d 
react? Participants who were alone in the room acted promptly and sensibly. 
They left the room to search for help, looked for the fire alarm and generally 
took action to take care of the potentially threatening situation.
Not so for the participants surrounded by other people. These other partici­
pants were in fact actors told to do nothing in response to the smoke. Seeing 
that the other people weren’t reacting, the participants did nothing too. Even 
when the smoke filled the room – past the point at which they’d have choked 
if this were a real fire – they continued calmly filling in their questionnaires.
Participants came up with many reasons why they sat still, despite clear indi­
cations that the building was on fire. They said that they’d assumed that the 
cause was a broken air-conditioning unit, for example. These thoughts never 
occurred to the people who were alone in the room, however. Clearly, the 
presence of other people changed how the participants interpreted the situa­
tion. Because the others were doing nothing, they assumed that the situation 
was safe and did nothing.
The Kitty Genovese story
Many social psychology textbooks begin a 
chapter on bystander-intervention experiments 
with the story of Kitty Genovese. She was a 
woman who lived in New York, and one day she 
was attacked outside her apartment block. She 
fought her assailant, screaming for help. Even 
though the garden where they fought was sur­
rounded by other flats, and many people heard 
her scream, no one called the police. They 
each came up with different reasons – it must 
be the sound of an argument, or a horror movie 
on TV, or someone else must have called for 
help. After a struggle of over 20 minutes, Kitty 
Genovese died.
This tragic story was written-up in the newspa­
pers as a damning indictment of cold-hearted 
New Yorkers who’d lost all sense of commu­
nity and neighbourly responsibility. The trouble 
is, the story isn’t true: at least, not as related 
in textbooks. Much later, researchers found 
the police logs and saw that many people had 
called the police station that night, very con­
cerned indeed. Her neighbours did try to help. 
But because of other things happening in the 
city that night, the police were unable to send a 
patrol car until too late.
Hearing that no police arrived in time, the 
newspaper writers jumped to the conclusion 
that the cause was a personal, dispositional 
one. Instead of checking up, they assumed 
that the facts were best explained by the cold 
hearts of mean New Yorkers. So, although the 
Kitty Genovese story isn’t a good example of 
bystander-intervention experiments, it is a 
useful case of the fundamental attribution error 
made by journalists and textbook writers.

)>>
Researchers call this tendency the diffusion of responsibility. In any ambigu­
ous situation, where you aren’t sure what’s happening, you use the reactions 
of other people to interpret the situation. Often, the surprising result is that 
a greater number of people reduces the chance that any individual acts. The 
implicit thought is, ‘Things must be okay, otherwise surely someone would’ve 
intervened by now.’
Wearing a cloak of anonymity: 
Deindividuation
As I describe in the preceding section, you can determine the power of the 
situation by how you interpret it. Similarly, you determine the power of your 
individual, internal dispositions by how you view yourself. The perhaps 
already weak force of your mood and personality can be further reduced 
when your identity is reduced. In this case, the power of the situation grows ‒ 
sometimes to an alarming extent.
)>>
Deindividuation occurs when you remove the signs that make you different 
from other people and identifiable as yourself. Uniforms are a way to deindi­
viduate people, as are masks and mirrored sunglasses.
Recently, London was rocked by protests and riots led by people wearing 
Guy Fawkes masks, which became the symbol of the Anonymous movement. 
When the police went in to quell the riots, some allegedly covered their 
badge numbers with one arm so that they couldn’t be reported for violent 
conduct. These actions of police and protestors show that deindividuation 
increases the power of the situation to determine behaviour, often with nega­
tive results.
Experiments show that when people are deindividuated, they act with less 
regard for others. For example, participants were asked to act as teachers 
who gave electric shocks to learners when they failed to memorised word 
pairs. They gave the shock by holding down the learner’s hand on an elec­
trical contact. This experiment is a version of the Milgram ones I discuss 
in Chapter 12, where the learners were actors and not harmed. But in this 
experiment, run with participants who were nurses, the participants held 
down the learner’s hand harder and for longer when they were asked to wear 
a deindividuating white hood.

Playing Cops and Robbers: the Stanford 
Prison Experiment
Philip Zimbardo, a social psychologist from Stanford University, was very 
interested in how a social situation could determine an individual’s behaviour. 
He was inspired by experiments such as Stanley Milgram’s (see Chapter 12) 
that found that seemingly mild mannered, upstanding citizens would obey an 
experimenter and commit the most horrible acts. Zimbardo was interested 
more specifically in what it was about certain situations that give them such 
power over people.
In particular, Zimbardo wanted to understand what happens in prisons. What 
gives guards their authority and swagger? What makes the prisoners obey, 
for the most part? Some may say that only authoritarian, domineering people 
become guards, and only submissive people end up as prisoners. But Zimbardo 
wanted to understand how the situation – the uniforms, the badges and the 
prisoners’ garb – helped to produce this behaviour.
The striking result of Zimbardo’s experiment is how completely ‘prisoners’ 
and ‘guards’ took on their roles. After the first day, the prisoners rarely ques­
tioned the guards’ authority, and even referred to themselves by their prison 
numbers. After the guards put on their uniforms and swung their batons they 
acted with remarkable cruelty to manipulate and control the prisoners.

guards?

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Background to the experiment
In the summer of 1971, in Palo Alto, California, an advertisement appeared in 
a newspaper asking for male volunteers to take part in a two-week prison sim­
ulation. This was the start of Zimbardo’s Stanford prison experiment, prob­
ably the most famous (perhaps notorious) social psychology experiment; as 
Zimbardo is fond of pointing out, it’s the only psychology experiment to give 
its name to a punk band.
After being extensively screened for any pre-existing psychological or health 
problems, 18 young men were selected to take part (plus six reserves) and 
told they’d be paid $15 a day (equivalent to about £50 in today’s money).
Preparation
The researchers tossed a coin to decide who’d be a guard and who a pris­
oner. This randomness is key. Having been randomly assigned, the partici­
pants were sent home.
The next day, real police cars and officers pulled up outside the houses of the 
‘prisoners’. The police carried out all the procedures of a usual arrest: they 
handcuffed the prisoners, put their hands on their heads as they got into the 
car, drove them to the station, took their fingerprints and so on. For the par­
ticipants, this was a bit of a lark, and everyone was in good spirits.
The participants chosen as guards were shown around the mock prison 
set-up in the basement of the university’s Psychology Department. It had 
a long corridor with a series of small cubicles leading off to the side. The 
researchers told the guards that their job was to keep order among the pris­
oners. They weren’t allowed to use physical force, but they had complete 
control over the prisoners’ situation.
The experiment begins
Zimbardo played the role of prison governor and his research assistants were 
deputies. The guards were given uniforms, with wooden batons and mirrored 
sunglasses. The prisoners were each assigned a number and given loose 
smocks to wear. They were placed three to a cell, and the doors were locked.

 Chapter 11: Appreciating the Power of the Situation
Days 1 and 2
The first day, there was a mild rebellion among the prisoners. They’d been 
making jokes all day, and the guards had struggled to assert their author­
ity. When the guards asked them to do things, they simply refused. On the 
second day, the surly spirit of the prisoners boiled over and they barri­
caded themselves in a cell and refused to come out. The guards took action. 
They identified the ring leaders of the rebellion and placed them in solitary 
confinement.
Then the guards spontaneously decided to do something very interesting. 
They set up a privilege cell with a wash basin, nicer clothes and better meals. 
Prisoners who complied with their demands were allowed to stay there, 
while the rebels were sent to solitary.
This approach appeared to break up the solidarity between the prisoners, 
and the rebellions fizzled out. The guards increased the use of punishments, 
making the prisoners do sit-ups and jumping jacks. They conducted random 
strip searches and room inspections. Visiting the toilet was a privilege, 
whereas most prisoners were made to use a bucket in their cells.
Seemingly without explicit instruction, the guards had hit upon a strategy 
that was turning the jokey, happy participants in an experiment into silent, 
obedient prisoners.
Day 3
On the third day, prisoner 8612 complained and asked to leave the experi­
ment. Zimbardo, acting as the prisoner governor, negotiated a deal. If pris­
oner 8612 stayed, then he could have his own cell. He agreed, but later that 
day he suffered severe emotional distress, suffering a mental breakdown. At 
this point, he left the experiment, and was replaced with another volunteer.
A priest who often helped real prisoners in the Californian penal system vis­
ited the ‘prison’. He was taken aback when the ‘prisoners’ introduced them­
selves spontaneously with their prison numbers rather than their names. 
After only four days, they’d taken on those numbers as their identities.
Day 4
On this day, prisoner 819 rebelled. In contrast to the earlier rebellions, he 
acted alone. The guards punished all the prisoners for his disobedience. 
Then they placed 819 in solitary, while leading the prisoners in a chant: 
‘Prisoner 819 did a bad thing. Because of what prisoner 819 did my cell is a 
mess.’ Inside the solitary cell, listening to these chants, 819 cried hysterically. 
He was the second person removed from the experiment (for details of the 
first, read the later sidebar ‘Experimental ethics today’).

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Again the guards increased their repression of the prisoners. They were made 
to clean toilets with their toothbrushes and woken randomly in the night to 
do sit-ups. Prisoner 416 refused to eat his food in protest. He was thrown into 
a cell, and the other prisoners were told to shout abuse at him. The guards 
gave the other prisoners a choice. If they wanted, they could let 416 have one 
of their blankets. No one donated his bedding, and 416 spent the night shiver­
ing in solitary confinement.
Before starting this experiment, these prisoners were probably as helpful and as 
friendly as any other young man in sunny Palo Alto. Yet here, a few days experi­
ence of the situation of being a prisoner had apparently turned them into a group 
of people completely unwilling to help a peer shivering in the room next door.
All too much: The experiment 
ends prematurely
The guards and prisoners weren’t the only ones who found themselves taken 
over by their assigned roles. Zimbardo himself, as the prison governor, was 
spending much of his day dealing with rebellions and managing the inmates. 
It wasn’t until one graduate student enquired about the welfare of the experi­
ment participants that Zimbardo realised he’d lost his way and remembered 
that these weren’t prisoners: they were volunteers in an experiment. He 
called an end to the experiment immediately, on day 6.
Analysing the fall out
You may be appalled that the human suffering I describe occurred as part of 
a psychology experiment in one of the top universities in America.
)>>
You can find documentary footage of the experiment online (www.prisonexp.
org). Watch it: but be warned that it’s harrowing stuff. I used to work at Stanford 
and one day took a wrong turning and ended up in the corridor and cubicles 
where the experiment was run. Having watched the documentary, thinking 
of the screams, I scuttled out as fast as possible, pretending I was late for a 
seminar.
When I tell students about the Stanford prison experiment, their reaction is 
mixed. Some are outraged at the suffering of the prisoners and aghast that 
Zimbardo was ever allowed to perform this experiment (to read about ethics 
in modern-day experiments, check out the nearby sidebar ‘Experimental 
ethics today’). Others think that Zimbardo is a genius. Many hold a mixture of 
those views.

 Chapter 11: Appreciating the Power of the Situation
Regardless of the rights and wrongs of this experiment being run, the fact is 
that it did take place and it serves as a stark illustration of the power of the 
situation on the individual.
)>>
The participants in this experiment were randomly assigned. On average, no 
differences existed between them in terms of their personalities or disposi­
tions. Because of the randomness of the coin toss, you can be sure that the 
only difference between these people was the situation in which they were 
placed: whether or not they were handed a guard’s uniform or a prisoner’s 
overalls. The extremes of behaviour are a shocking illustration of the power of 
the situation.
The experiment had many repercussions inside and outside of psychology. 
Inside psychology, it led to a serious rethink about the ethical laws that guide 
our research. It remains probably the most famous example of the extremes 
of behaviour that can be produced in an experiment.
Outside of psychology, the Stanford prison experiment challenged many 
assumptions people had about the causes of individual’s behaviour. There 
are clear implications for many aspects of society, from the way we train 
police and armed forces, to the way that we label and incarcerate people as 
‘criminals’ or ‘young offenders’ and the consequences that identity may have 
in causing later behaviour.
Experimental ethics today
Nothing like the Stanford prison experiment 
could be run in a university today. Strict ethical 
guidelines exist about how psychologists treat 
participants in their experiments. Before they 
can collect a single piece of data, researchers 
have to describe the experiments to an ethical 
review panel and scrutinise every detail to see 
that no harm can come to participants.
Several key principles when conducting experi­
ments are now set in stone. For example, if 
any participants, at any time, ask to leave the 
experiment, they must be allowed to do so. They 
don’t have to give a reason, and they have to 
receive all the payment or compensation that 
they would’ve received if they’d stayed. In 
the Stanford prison experiment, prisoner 8612 
complained and asked to leave the experiment. 
Zimbardo, acting as the prisoner governor, 
negotiated a deal: if he stayed, he could have 
his own cell. He agreed, but later that day he 
suffered severe emotional distress, suffering 
a mental breakdown. At this point, he left the 
experiment and was replaced with another vol­
unteer. That situation could never arise today. 
If you volunteer to take part in a psychology 
experiment today, by the end you’ll be safe and 
happy and – at the very absolute worst – maybe 
a little bit bored.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
At the time, the Stanford prison experiment also fuelled the debate about 
prison conditions at a social level, but it also had repercussions on a per­
sonal level: one of the experimental participants who was randomly assigned 
to be a prisoner spent the rest of his life as a counsellor looking after the wel­
fare of real prisoners.
Finally, I have no direct evidence but a very strong hunch that the Stanford 
prison experiment also inspired many formats of reality television. The BBC 
recreated the entire experiment for a TV show, for example. But I think that 
in more subtle ways the notion that you can dictate a situation and therefore 
dictate behaviour lurks behind the thinking of shows such as Big Brother and 
Survivor.
Analysing What Makes Someone Evil
The toss of a coin can be sufficient to turn one person into a submissive and 
scared prisoner and another into a swaggering, cruel guard, as we saw in the 
previous section. The use of random assignments in experiments that put 
people in one condition or another confirms that those different situations 
can produce extremes of behaviour.
In this section, I discuss some of the wider implications of the power of the 
situation illustrated by the Stanford prison experiment. Sadly, the extreme 
situations from that experiment are by no means confined to the laboratory, 
and often the consequences are far more severe. Here, I discuss the case of 
Lynndie England, who was made a guard in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, and 
committed acts that horrified the world.
At the military prison in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, Lynndie England and others 
abused and tortured the Iraqi prisoners, even taking photographs as memen­
tos. These images were discovered and broadcast across the world, bringing 
shame to the US military and serving as a recruitment tool for its enemies. 
England and the other military staff involved were placed on trial in the US. 
Coincidentally, one of the defence teams recruited Philip Zimbardo, creator 
of the Stanford prison experiment (see the earlier section ‘Playing Cops and 
Robbers: the Stanford Prison Experiment’), as an expert witness in their 
defence.
England’s defence was based on the notion that the situation she was put in 
had a large contribution to the abuse she committed:

✓)>>Before joining the reserves, she worked in a chicken slaughterhouse.
)>>
✓)>>She was given minimal training before being flown to Iraq.
)>>
✓)>>On arriving at Abu Ghraib she saw prisoners being abused for the 
amusement of the guards.
)>>
✓)>>She reported little oversight of the guards’ actions; guards seemed to 
have free licence in how they treated the prisoners.
In addition, despite no credible evidence for a connection between Osama 
Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, many people at the time felt that the Iraqi 
war was payback for the September 11 attacks on America. Politicians such 
as Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney promoted this view and tacitly sup­
ported the view that torture was an acceptable means of interrogation for 
Al-Qaeda suspects.
From Lynndie England’s perspective, abuse of Iraqi prisoners was going on 
all around her and was tolerated by a chain of superiors, who even encour­
aged her to view these people as sub-human and without rights. As a result, 
her argument was that she was simply complying with what was expected of 
her, something that is (to some degree at least) supported by the psychologi­
cal evidence. Placed in that situation, Lynndie England was doing nothing but 
complying with what was expected of her, just like the guards in the Stanford 
prison experiment.
If moral responsibility neatly lines up with psychological causation, things 
would be very convenient. For example, society could use psychological data 
to judge moral responsibility and draw up laws and the like on the following 
basis:
)>>
✓)>>If my personal dispositions (my thoughts, intentions and beliefs) cause 
my actions, I’m fully responsible for them in a moral and legal sense.
)>>
✓)>>If the situation causes my actions, I’m less morally responsible for them.
But personally, I don’t think that the two items line up well at all.
If Lynndie England’s abusive behaviour was caused in a large part by the psy­
chological power of the situation she was placed in, for example, that doesn’t 
necessarily imply that she is less guilty of the crimes of which she was 
accused. In other words, moral responsibility isn’t really a scientific question, 
at its heart. Science can reveal the root causes of behaviour, but this is hard 
to translate into non-scientific concepts like blame, choice and responsibility. 
Perhaps this is why lawyers earn more than social psychologists.

Carrying Out Orders: Obedience

▶)>>Investigating obedience experimentally
▶)>>Testing obedience today
O

bedience plays a role in the smallest to the largest dramas in human 
history, from family squabbles over who cleans a room, to senseless 
wars fought over imagined insults. Obedience occurs when less powerful 
members of a group follow the orders of others simply because they have 
higher authority. That authority can be due to wealth, age, descent from 
royalty or a democratic election. Without some degree of obedience human 
societies would find it hard to function: someone has to make the decisions, 
after all. If we didn’t obey traffic signs, police officers and doctors, life would 
be very difficult. But taking obedience to extremes, figures of authority can 
demand that people carry out murderous, evil acts, things that individuals 
might never do of their own choice (read the nearby sidebar ‘The chilling 
banality of evil’ for an example). In these cases, who is to blame? The person 
in authority, or the person who is ‘simply following orders’?
In this chapter I explore what makes people obey to extremes: why they 
follow orders to kill or harm others, even though those orders go against the 
moral codes that every society follows. I examine what factors influence obe­
dience and how they’re used today in, say, military training. I reveal the com­
plexities involved in researching this issue by describing Stanley Milgram’s 
seminal experiments on obedience, which shocked American society when 
they were published.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Investigating Obedience
Obedience is a form of social influence, a way that one person can affect the 
behaviour of another. It is quite distinct from other forms of social influence, 
however. Think back to your school days, and all forms of social influence are 
at play. Compliance occurs when one person follows the orders of another 
because of some tangible threat. When the school bully asks for your lunch 
money and you hand it over, that’s compliance. Conformity occurs when one 
person copies the actions of another to fit in, or because they don’t know 
what else to do (see Chapter 13). If you had to have the same sports train­
ers as the cool kids in your year, that’s conformity. Persuasion occurs when 
someone convinces you that a certain course of action is the right thing to 
do, for example, that throwing a paper aeroplane at the maths teacher would 
be hilarious.
Obedience is different to all these forms of social influence. Here you obey 
someone not because of an immediate threat, not to fit in with everyone else, 
and not even because you think it’s a good idea. You obey just because the 
person asking has a position of authority. Not all teachers have this sense 
of authority, I’m sure you’ll agree. Some would threaten you with detention; 
The chilling banality of evil
Adolf Eichmann was put on trial for his part 
in the Holocaust, for meticulously planning 
and facilitating the extermination of six million 
Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. The prosecu­
tor described Eichmann as evil and as having 
a sadistic personality. This conclusion is hard 
to argue with: if anything in history can be 
described as evil, surely it’s the Holocaust and 
those who carried it out, day-to-day.
The German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt 
covered Eichmann’s trial as a reporter and put 
forward a different, highly controversial view. To 
her, what was remarkable about Eichmann was 
that he wasn’t a slavering monster, filled with 
hate. What made an impression on her, listening 
to the trial, was the ‘banality of evil’. Eichmann 
seemed like a dull middle-management civil 
servant. He was simply ‘following orders’, like 
anyone else.
Her insights are more chilling than the conclu­
sion that Eichmann was simply a ‘monster’. If 
that was true, then he could be dismissed as 
an abnormality, a one-off. If educated, civilised 
people like the Germans can behave like that 
because someone tells them to, surely it can 
happen anywhere and to anyone. In which 
case, how do you prevent such horrors ever 
happening again?
Arendt wasn’t trying to excuse Eichmann for his 
crimes, though many people at the time thought 
so. She was raising the same question that I do 
throughout this book: what explains an individu­
al’s behaviour, their personality or their situation?

 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
some would try and persuade you. But some teachers that I can remember 
simply had an aura of power, and no one would question or pause when they 
gave a command.
In this section, I’ll look at a famous experiment in social psychology that 
investigated how, and why, some people obey and some people don’t, and 
what factors in the situation produce obedience.
Obeying in the laboratory: Milgram’s 
experiments
In this section, I examine obedience through the lens of one of the most 
famous experiments in social psychology, which was conducted by Stanley 
Milgram. His studies reveal that with obedience (as with so much human 
behaviour) situation tends to trump individual qualities. An authority figure, 
such as a scientist in a white coat, can persuade people to carry out extreme 
actions that they’d never suspect possible.
Milgram ran many versions of his experiment, each time carefully varying 
the procedure and the situation in which he placed his participants. In this 
way, his experiments were able to reveal exactly what factors increase and 
decrease obedience.
Stanley Milgram, a social psychologist, rose to the challenge of why people 
obey authority figures even to extreme ends. He wanted to know what made 
thousands of Germans carry out the atrocities of the Holocaust. Were Adolf 
Eichmann and his like fundamentally evil? What about the German people in 
general? To read more about the subject, see the earlier sidebar ‘The chilling 
banality of evil’.
)>>
Milgram’s shocking conclusion was that any average town in America contains 
plenty of people who’d carry out acts of terror and genocide, if ordered to do 
so. But this conclusion isn’t about the fundamental evil nature of humanity; 
it’s a statement of the power of the situation (something I discuss in detail in 
Chapter 11).

‘Experimental accidents’.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Being a teacher in Milgram’s experiment: Background
Milgram asked for volunteers to participate in an experiment on ‘learning and 
memory’ at Yale University. Only men were recruited, though later experi­
ments found little difference with female participants (in each case, the 
person in authority was a man though). The original participants were men 
from a range of ages and social backgrounds. If you’d agreed to take part in 
the experiment, here’s what you’d have experienced.
You’re greeted by an experimenter in a white lab coat. Also present is another 
person who answered the newspaper advertisement as well. The experi­
menter explains that you’re both going to take part in an experiment on the 
effects of punishment on learning. To start, you’re assigned a role by drawing 
slips of paper out of a bag. You’re given the role of the teacher and the other 
man is the learner. The learner is to be given a number of word-pairs (such as 
‘doctor’ and ‘house’) to remember. Your job is to read out the first word and 
ask the learner to call out the second. If he doesn’t do so, you’re to adminis­
ter a small electric shock to the learner.
Your first job is to help set up the experiment. The learner sits down and you 
help the experimenter strap his hands to the seat so that they’re touching 
the electrodes. Then you go next door and the experimenter shows you an 
Experimental accidents
Milgram didn’t set out to study the limits of 
obedience. He wanted to study something else 
entirely. He was fascinated by Asch’s studies 
of conformity, which I discuss in Chapter 13, 
where participants tend to follow the answer 
given by other people in a group, even though 
it’s plainly incorrect. In light of this surprising 
demonstration, Milgram wondered whether 
people would also conform when they had a 
strong reason not to. What would happen if 
people were asked to do something that they 
found difficult or unpleasant: causing harm to 
an innocent person.
To assess the effect of conformity, he contrived 
an experiment in which a person was instructed 
to give electric shocks to another person. He 
planned to investigate whether people would 
obey this command if they saw one, two or 
many other people doing the same thing. To 
start, he needed a baseline comparison, a situ­
ation where people acted by themselves with­
out the influence of other people. So he ran his 
first control experiment with the participant 
acting alone, expecting to see little or no obedi­
ence. But he never ran his other experimental 
conditions, because what he saw in his control 
condition amazed him. His routine baseline 
condition in conformity became a study of obe­
dience, and perhaps the most famous set of 
studies in social psychology.

­electronics box labelled ‘Shock generator type ZLB’. It has a row of 30 switches 
and a couple of dials and lights. Under each switch is the number of volts, 
from ‘15’ all the way to ‘450’, and words describing these numbers, from ‘slight 
shock’, through ‘strong shock’ to ‘extreme intensity shock’. The last descrip­
tion says ‘Danger: Severe Shock’. The final two switches, for 435 and 450 volts, 
are labelled in red ink as a warning ‘XXX’.
The experimenter tells you that each time the learner gets an answer wrong, 
you’re to give him a shock. With each administered shock, you move along the 
row of switches, giving him 15 volts more than last time. So that you get a sense 
of what the shocks are like, the experimenter gives you a shock of 45 volts. It’s 
an uncomfortable tickle – but that’s only the third switch on the row of 30.
)>>
The Milgram experiment is an artful piece of theatre. The learner is a fellow 
researcher acting his lines and the real subject of the experiment is the teacher. 
Learner and experimenter follow a carefully rehearsed script, with planned 
responses to the teacher’s actions and questions. The only electric shock ever 
administered is the 45-volt shock given to the participant to ‘prove’ that the 
apparatus is real.
Carrying out the experiment
Here’s how the experiment proceeds:
)>>
1.)>>The teacher states a word to start the experiment.
琀
屴The learner gets the word-pair wrong and the teacher presses the switch 
to give him a short burst of a shock.
琀
屴At this point, with a low dose of electricity, there is no sound from the 
learner.
)>>
2.)>>The teacher continues stating words and the learner gets every one 
wrong.
琀
屴The teacher presses the switch and gives a shock each time. So far he 
hears nothing from the learner in the next room other than a slight noise.
)>>
3.)>>The teacher receives another wrong answer, presses the switch to 
administer a shock at the 75-volt mark and hears the learner in the 
next room grunt.
)>>
4.)>>The teacher hears the learner complain loudly of the pain at the 
120-volt shock.
)>>
5.)>>The learner screams ‘Let me out of here!’ at 150 volts.
琀
屴He also shouts that he has a heart condition and demands to leave.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
琀
屴At this point some participants turn to the experimenter and ask whether 
they should stop. The experimenter replies, ‘Please continue.’ Some pro­
test, but he says ‘The experiment requires that you continue.’ Most par­
ticipants shake their heads but continue to read out the next question.
)>>
6.)>>The shocks increase in voltage and the learner’s cries become more 
and more anguished.
琀
屴Some participants ask how dangerous these shocks really are. The 
experimenter says, ‘Although the shocks may be painful, there’s no per­
manent damage, so please go on.’
)>>
7.)>>At 285 volts (labelled an ‘intense shock’) the learner lets out a hysterical 
scream of agony.
琀
屴Most teachers turn wildly to the experimenter. He calmly tells them that 
the experiment requires that they continue.
)>>
8.)>>After a long pause most people reached for the next switch and 
administer the next highest shock.
琀
屴A dreadful silence emanates from the room next door. The learner doesn’t 
give any replies to the questions, but this counts as an incorrect answer 
and the teacher is required to keep administering the shocks. Perhaps 
many think that the man – who had complained of a heart condition, 
remember – is unconscious. ‘It’s absolutely essential that you continue,’ 
says the experimenter, in reply to any protests.
)>>
9.)>>Many participants reach for the next switch at 300 volts. They can see 
that ten more switches are still to go, all the way to 450 volts. The exper­
iment clears his throat: ‘You have no choice; you must go on.’

I urge you to watch the black and white documentary footage of participants 
in the Milgram experiments: it’s online at http://www.openculture.
com/2013/11/watch-footage-from-the-psychology-experiment-
that-shocked-the-world-milgrams-obedience-study-1961.html. 
You’re left in little doubt that the participants believe that the learner is 
in real pain. The teachers are in genuine and visible anguish about what 
they’re doing and watching can be quite harrowing. They protest, they com­
plain, they twist and squirm in their seats and break out in a nervous sweat. 
They’re in all the psychological anguish you’d expect when someone is caus­
ing pain to another human being. But remarkably, despite all this personal 
distress, they reach over and flick the next switch. They don’t stop obeying.
Making predictions about obedience

Ask yourself what you’d do as the teacher. How far would you go before you 
disobey the experimenter? You probably have a sense of how many volts 
you’d administer before disobeying the experimenter, but before I tell you

 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
precisely how Milgram’s participants responded, also try and predict their 
behaviour yourself. What was the average voltage, from 15 to 450, at which 
people refused to go on? What percentage of people went all the way to the 
final switch?
Milgram himself asked these questions to Yale undergraduates, his psychol­
ogy professor colleagues and professional psychiatrists. I always ask my 
undergraduate classes too and the results are quite consistent. People guess 
that most participants stop at 150 volts (step 5 in the preceding section), 
when the learner asks explicitly to leave the experiment. They predict that 
around 1 per cent or less of participants will go all the way to the final switch 
of 450 volts.
)>>
But the people who administer the very highest voltage aren’t the exceptions. 
They aren’t freakish sadists. Amazingly most of the participants administered 
the highest possible shock to the learner. Milgram reported that 63 per cent of 
participants went all the way to the last switch. This means that 37 per cent 
of people stopped before the end, of course. But the average voltage that 
people reached before they stopped was 360 volts. (The learner with the heart 
condition went ominously silent at 300 volts.) For some possible reasons why 
people are so far out in their estimates, take a look at the later sidebar ‘Why 
do people fail to predict Milgram’s results?’.
From these results Milgram reached his grim conclusion that plenty of people 
in the average American town would act much as Nazi torturers did.
Why do people fail to predict Milgram’s results?
People simply can’t predict successfully the 
result of Milgram’s experiments. Their predic­
tions aren’t just a little off; they’re not in the 
same country! They consistently and massively 
fail to anticipate Milgram’s results because of 
the fundamental attribution error that I discuss 
in Chapter 9. In short, this mistake derives from 
people’s tendency to explain behaviour in terms 
of personality rather than the situation.
In Milgram’s experiment, people tend to assume 
that the only people who’d go along with 
the experimenter are weak-willed cowards, 
authoritarians who follow any order obsessively 
or sadists. They estimate that such people are 
quite rare and consequently that only a few 
people would obey Milgram’s experimenter to 
the very end.
But this reasoning ignores a central finding of 
social psychology, and a theme of this book: the 
situation is a powerful influence on behaviour. 
Therefore, around 60 per cent of people obey 
the experimenter and administer the 450-volt 
shock, and in all probability you would too.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Perhaps you’re asking yourself if the participants really believed Milgram’s 
deception. Maybe they saw through the fake random draw that made the 
participant the teacher and the confederate the learner. Or maybe, with the 
Eichmann trial prominent in the newspapers at the time, they guessed that it 
was simply an experiment in obedience.
Well, Milgram debriefed his participants and excluded their data if they’d 
guessed what was going on. Also, he’d anticipated this response to his find­
ings and invited other scientists into his laboratory to observe the experi­
ment taking place.
Suggesting influences on increasing 
and decreasing obedience
Milgram realised that his experiments needed to do more than show obedi­
ence at work (see the earlier section ‘Obeying in the laboratory: Milgram’s 
experiments’). To understand the phenomenon, he needed to pick apart and 
control the factors that increased and decreased the rate at which people 
obeyed the command to harm others.
As I describe in this section, Milgram identified and demonstrated two fac­
tors at work.
Tuning in to the learner
)>>
Obedience decreases when the teacher is psychologically closer to the 
learner. When the learner in Milgram’s experiments is in the next room and 
the participant is unable to see him and only perceives his presence when he 
bangs on the cubical wall, obedience is highest. More people deliver the maxi­
mum shock and administer a higher average voltage of shock.
When the participant can hear what the learner is saying, obedience reduces. 
Obedience drops further if the participant is sitting adjacent to the learner. 
It’s at its lowest level when they’re sitting together and the participant has to 
press the learner’s hand down onto the electrodes to administer the shock, 
although in this condition about a third of participants still obey the experi­
menter’s commands.
)>>
You can probably think of how this principle can be extended to acts of obedi­
ence and aggression outside of Milgram’s experiments. Do you think that fol­
lowing the order to kill is easier when you’re holding the gun a few metres

 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
away from your victim, or when you press a button and launch a drone that 
assassinates your victim thousands of miles away? One is psychologically 
much easier for you, although they’re pretty much the same for your victim.
Tuning out the experimenter
)>>
Obedience decreases when the teacher is psychologically distant to the exper­
imenter. When the experimenter gives his initial instructions, but then retires 
to the next room and speaks over an intercom, obedience drops dramatically. 
Only 20 per cent of people obey to the highest shock.
The same low level of obedience occurs when the experimenter isn’t a Yale 
scientist, but another participant delivering the orders. (Of course, they 
aren’t really another participant but are acting a part like the learner.) But 
in this case, where the authority of the person issuing the commands is 
reduced, obedience is reduced.
The lowest level of obedience occurs when two experimenters are present, 
but part way through the experiment they disagree with each other. One 
objects to the experiment and says it should end; the other orders the par­
ticipant to continue. In this condition, no participant administers the highest 
electric shock, and the average shock is around 150 volts, the point at which 
the learner asks to leave the experiment.
These results make me think back to school days. I realise that unless you 
went to military boot camp, your school teachers probably didn’t order you 
to kill things. But they did expect you to obey them when you’d rather not. 
You can probably remember that in a classroom of children, those sitting 
at the table closest to the teacher tended to be the most likely to obey and 
those at the back weren’t. And what happened when the teacher gave you 
strict orders but then walked out to the stationery cupboard for five minutes? 
Pandemonium.
Also, think about having a supply teacher, standing in for your regular teach­
ers. For some reason, in my school at least, these teachers were unable to 
keep any sort of order. They didn’t have the authority over us, it seemed. 
Worst of all was a poor supply teacher who got told off by the headmaster in 
front of us for using the wrong textbook. Nothing he said mattered anymore 
to us after that.
)>>
Milgram’s data show that obedience is a remarkably powerful force but is also 
fragile. When the experimenter’s distance from the situation is increased, his 
authority lessens or is questioned, and obedience rates plummeted. Bear that 
in mind if you’re interested in promoting social conditions that reduce blind 
obedience to authority; or if you’re considering a career as a school teacher.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Theorising reasons for levels of obedience
What makes people obey the commands of the experimenter in Milgram’s 
experiments? As I emphasise, they aren’t sadists who enjoy or are indiffer­
ent to the suffering that they’re causing, because the consequences of their 
actions is anguish. So why don’t they simply stop?
In this section, I suggest and sometimes dismiss possible reasons.
Suffering from an authoritarian personality
At the time of the Milgram’s experiments, a notion existed that some people 
were predisposed to follow authority ‒ called authoritarian personalities. 
These people were thought, by birth or upbringing, to be easily compelled 
by others. The specific suggestion was of a cultural difference in Europe: per­
haps the German people were more likely to be authoritarian, much as the 
French were romantics and the English incurably uptight.
)>>
Milgram’s results dispute this theory. He carried out the experiments in 
America, where independence and distrust of authority is prized. The right to 
own a gun, for example, is written into the Constitution so its citizens can offer 
armed resistance to the government. Yet even there, Milgram found remark­
able rates of obedience.
Of course, important cultural differences do have an impact and may be part 
of the explanation for the actions of the Germans. Culture can play a role in 
legitimising certain sources of authority, but the idea that you can explain 
obedience in terms of the national character seems plain wrong.
Appreciating the central role of authority
Obedience requires a legitimate authority. If the source of authority is dis­
tant, absent or questioned, obedience plummets (as I describe in the earlier 
section ‘Suggesting influences on increasing and decreasing obedience’). 
Milgram also manipulated the nature of authority by relocating the experi­
ment to Bridgeport, a nearby town that was much less ‘respectable’ than 
the Yale campus. The participants went to the ‘lab’ that was a room above a 
shopfront. This change in location reduced the rates of obedience, though 
they remained surprisingly high. The prestige of Yale seemed to bolster the 
authority of the experimenters.
Milgram also suggests that the authority of science itself exerts an influence 
over the participants. The experimenters were even told to state that ‘the 
experiment requires that you continue’, as if experiments themselves have 
thoughts and needs. If the participants say that they want to stop they’re

 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
somehow questioning the moral authority and competence of the scientist 
from prestigious Yale University, who has a PhD and a white coat and seems 
very sure of himself. Who are they to question him?
Authority is closely linked to responsibility. When they objected to the 
experiment, participants often talked about who was going to be responsible 
for what was happening. Who would be to blame if the learner suffered a 
heart attack? The experimenter calmly assured the participants that he was 
responsible and asked them to continue.
)>>
Jerry Bulger, who carried out revised versions of the Milgram experiments, 
found that those who disobeyed the experimenter were the ones who talked 
about responsibility. These participants seemed to decide finally that they 
were responsible if harm came to the learner, and this convinced them to 
resist the experimenter’s authority.
Lacking a script
The transcripts of what participants said during the experiment reveal some­
thing very surprising.
)>>
You get the impression that instead of people being driven to obey, they just 
really suck at disobeying. One term for this tendency is scriptlessness.
People’s lives are shaped by implicit, unspoken cultural norms and habits 
(read Chapter 13 if you need persuading). Scripts exist for how you talk about 
the weather with a stranger, or taste a little bit of wine first at the restaurant 
before smiling and nodding to the waiter, or address a doctor or complain in 
a shop. Milgram observed that his participants didn’t have a script for how 
to disobey a scientist and so simply didn’t know what to say.
The transcripts show that participants seemed very unsure about how to 
criticise the scientist. They even apologise for it. After hearing a man scream 
in agony they say things like, ‘I don’t mean to be rude, but I think you should 
look in on him.’ Milgram sees their timidity as stemming from an uncertainty 
about how to go about disobeying someone in authority.
This behaviour may well seem implausible to you. Why didn’t they just say 
no and storm out of the room? But perhaps you can recall an incident where 
you wanted to act, but simply didn’t know what the script was. For example, 
you see a couple arguing at a restaurant, and it looks like things may turn vio­
lent. But how do you intrude on a complete strangers’ conversation when it 
should be none of your business?
www.it-ebooks.info

190
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Or perhaps you witnessed something happening at school that you wanted 
to stop but didn’t. Maybe the popular kids in the class were teasing some­
one cruelly. You thought they should stop but were worried that if you said 
something, they’d turn on you. They’d think that you didn’t enjoy the joke or 
thought they weren’t funny (after all, nothing’s as side-splittingly hilarious as 
causing deliberate misery).
So although saying that participants in Milgram’ study should just have said 
no is an understandable reaction, remember how easy underestimating the 
power of these situational forces can be.
Escalating demands
One tiny aspect of Milgram’s experimental design may well have slipped by 
you, but it probably made all the difference in his experiment. What do think 
would have happened if the order of the switches on the apparatus was 
reversed and participants started at 450 volts and then decreased the shock?
Your intuition is probably correct: very few people would administer a maxi­
mum shock of 450 volts at the outset of the experiment. Milgram thought that 
the set-up of gradually escalating shocks, beginning with only 15 volts, was 
crucial in causing people to obey the final order to administer the highest 
level of shock.
The reality is that you have very few grounds to refuse to give the learner a 
shock at 15 volts when you’ve turned up to the experiment, accepted the pay­
ment and experienced only a slight tingle from a 45-volt shock. You have little 
reason not to start the shock treatment.
)>>
But in fact at any stage in the experiment the participant seems to have little 
justification to refuse to give a shock of X volts when moments ago he gave a 
shock of X minus 15 volts. In other words, saying that you have a principle of 
never doing harm to another human being, of resisting authority when it con­
travenes your personal morality and so on, is all very well. But when, exactly, 
do these abstract moral principles come into play? Endorsing these ideas is 
simple, but saying that they apply at 180 volts but not at 165 volts is almost 
impossible. No clear point applies as to when the given orders are clearly 
wrong.
Imagine that you do consider stopping at 270 volts, when a particularly 
heart-wrenching scream erupts from the learner. The problem is, if you do 
indeed stop now, you aren’t just saying that giving a 270-volt shock is wrong; 
you’re saying that causing harm to another person is wrong. There is nothing 
special about 270 volts that makes that wrong, but 255 volts morally okay. 
So if it’s wrong at 270 volts, you were wrong to give the shock at 255 volts, 
www.it-ebooks.info

191
 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
240 volts, 225 volts and so on. In other words, by saying that you refuse to 
obey, you’re not only implying that the experimenter was wrong to command 
you, but also that you were wrong to obey up until that point.
Admitting that they were wrong and revising their past beliefs is very dif­
ficult for people. As I describe in Chapter 6, cognitive dissonance is pro­
duced whenever a conflict exists between people’s beliefs (causing harm to 
others is wrong) and their actions (I was responsible for causing harm to 
another). People go through mental contortions to reduce or avoid cognitive 
dissonance.
)>>
Instead of admitting that they caused harm in the past, they form the belief 
that the experimenter is fully responsible for any harm that comes to the 
learner. They continue to cause harm to the learner rather than face the cogni­
tive consequences of admitting that they’ve already caused harm.
This is also called the foot-in-the-door technique, which I discuss in 
Chapter 14 on persuasion. You begin with a small, reasonable request and 
when someone has agreed to it, you can move on to make a bigger request. 
As you escalate your demands, people continue to consent and obey.
This principle fits the historical case of Nazism, and many other such move­
ments. It’s reasonable to assume that almost no one who voted for Hitler in 
1933 was voting in favour of carrying out the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism was 
present at the start of the Nazi movement, of course, but it was only part of a 
complex mixture of motivations, policies and emotions that Hitler exploited.
Then violence against Jews grew in severity and explicit political motiva­
tion. The incremental increase acted against dissent. Why object to limited 
movement of the Jewish population after their right to citizenship had been 
revoked? When they’ve been moved into ghettos, why not support full-scale 
deportation? Like the switches on Milgram’s box, this gradual escalation of 
abuse made it less likely that anyone would resist any individual attack on 
the Jewish population.
Researching Obedience Today
Some people think that the results of Milgram’s experiments (see ‘Obeying in 
the laboratory: Milgram’s experiments’ earlier in this chapter) are a reflection 
of American society in the early 1960s. All his participants had lived through 
the Second World War and many served in the forces in that conflict or in 
subsequent wars. Perhaps these experiences steeled them against the suffer­
ing of others or ground into them the virtue of obedience.
www.it-ebooks.info

192
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
)>>
Confirming or denying this suggestion would require the same experiment 
to be carried out today, which is difficult because replicating Milgram’s 
experiments as he ran them would be unethical (see the nearby sidebar 
‘Experimental ethics’). But by using technology and ingenuity, psychologists 
can provide a good indication of how many people would rebel and how many 
would obey now: this research shows that Milgram’s findings are equally true 
of people today.
These compelling studies show how psychology can employ creative meth­
ods to study social life scientifically.
Studying obedience in ethical ways
In 2006, Jerry Bulger carried out a careful, partial replication of Milgram’s 
studies. He carefully pre-screened his participants for any existing or poten­
tial mental health issues that the experiments may aggravate. He realised that 
a key moment in Milgram’s experiment was when the learner first protests 
that he wanted to leave the experiment. At this point the electric shock is 
below 150 volts and the learner isn’t giving any obvious signs of pain or dis­
tress. In Bulger’s replication, the experiment is stopped after the learner says 
he wants to leave, and the participant indicates whether he would continue 
to shock the learner. We know from Milgram’s studies that if they keep going 
past 150 volts, the chances are that they will go all the way to 450 volts.
With this design, an ethical review board approved the experiment. It allows 
psychologists to still study whether participants will obey an instruction 
to harm, but saves the participants the trauma of listening to the tortured 
learner. Bulger’s results aren’t statistically different from Milgram’s. Around 
70 per cent of people were prepared to press on past 150 volts and, we 
assume, would have administered the highest shock were the experiment 
allowed to continue.
Experimental ethics
Milgram’s participants experienced extreme 
stress and anxiety when ordered to cause harm 
to another person. Today, experimental ethics 
forbids psychologists from putting their experi­
mental participants through any such ordeal. If 
any participants make the remotest suggestion 
that they want to stop the experiment, experi­
menters immediately thank them for their time, 
pay them and let them go. Phrases such as ‘you 
must go on’ and ‘the experiment requires that 
you continue’ aren’t ones that you’d ever hear 
a researcher use today.

193
 Chapter 12: Carrying Out Orders: Obedience
Another partial replication of Milgram’s study copied his procedure exactly, 
but did so in virtual reality, with a learner as a computer-generated avatar. 
The interesting thing about this experiment isn’t just that the researchers 
replicated Milgram’s findings, but that the participants similarly reported 
great distress when obeying the order to harm the virtual learner.
)>>
Human beings may have a strong tendency to obey, but they also have an 
impulse to empathise, even with a computer graphic.
‘All together now!’
Obedience is investigated in several different ways today. One of my favourite 
experiments of the past few years studied the relationship between the way a 
group of people moves together and their tendency to obey authority.
A goose-step is a slightly silly-looking military march that could’ve been 
invented by Monty Python’s Flying Circus. Yet, if you’ve seen the footage, 
something’s immediately chilling about the sight of a Nazi rally of thousands 
of soldiers, goose-steeping in perfect unison. And of course, all armies march 
in unison in some way. A psychologist called Scott Wiltermuth wondered 
whether moving in time with each other caused a psychological effect upon 
the soldiers.
When two people mimic each other’s gestures and body language, they tend 
to like each other, as I mention in Chapter 14: their synchronised movement 
strengthens the social bonds between them. So if that happens between a 
pair of people, you’d imagine that a whole group of soldiers moving together 
would be a really friendly loving group of people. Well, it doesn’t always work 
out like that.
Wiltermuth and his colleagues asked participants to walk around a campus 
a few steps behind the experimenter. In one condition, they were told just to 
follow him, in the other to match his footsteps, walking in time with him. In 
other words, they walked or marched.
Then the experimenter requested that they help out with a different experi­
ment that studied physiological reactions to unpleasant tasks. The task in 
this case: to kill living creatures. Participants were introduced to the ‘extermi­
nation machine’, which was in fact a modified coffee grinder. They were then 
instructed to place as many woodlice (sow bugs) as possible into the grinder 
chute in 30 seconds. After the 30 seconds were up, the experimenter asked if 
they’d press the button to start the grinding blades.
www.it-ebooks.info

194
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Some social psychology theatre is at work here, because a small flap in the 
chute meant that every bug tossed into the grinder slid to safety. No wood­
lice were killed during these experiments. But the participants didn’t know 
this. They really thought that the grumbling grinding noise from the exter­
mination machine was the sound of bug bodies being chewed up. Bugs that 
they themselves had placed there.
)>>
The participants who had previously marched in time with the experimenter 
sent nearly 45 per cent more bugs to their deaths than the participants who 
had walked at their own pace. They were almost twice as likely to press the 
button to start the grinding blades. Other experiments showed that this 
increase in obedience, and a willingness to take the life of other creatures, 
didn’t occur if they made a marching action that was out of sync with the 
experimenter, or if the experimenter who asked them to kill the bugs wasn’t 
the same person with whom they’d marched. The powerful effect of marching 
upon participants’ obedience was specific to the person they marched behind.
These experiments reveal a dark side to co-ordinated actions. Previously, 
most social psychological studies had looked at the positive, affiliate feelings 
produced by co-ordinated activity. But as Wiltermuth points out, modern 
armies don’t need to march anymore. For the past hundred years, no one has 
marched on a battlefield. Yet wander into a military training academy and 
you see that it’s still an essential part of a soldier’s training. Marching isn’t 
used just for physical training, these experiments suggest, but also for its 
psychological link to obedience and aggression.

our life is governed by rules. You are probably well aware of many of 
them. If, for example, you learnt to drive then you had to memorise the 
Highway Code and all the rules about speed limits, the correct procedure for 
roundabouts and when to check your mirrors and indicate. But there is a much 
more detailed set of rules about how to live your life outside of the car: how to 
queue in shops, what to say to a waiter, how close you should stand to strang­
ers and to friends. The trouble is, there is no Highway Code for Life. All of these 
customs, conventions and points of etiquette are called social norms. Though 
you may not be aware of them, you have spent much of your life learning them.
Do you nod your head when you agree with someone? Do you always make 
sure that you belch loudly after a meal? Would you blow your nose in front 
of another person? These questions may seem easy to answer, but if you ask 
other people from around the world you may well get the opposite answer: 
Greeks shake their heads to agree, a belch is a compliment in some Middle 
Eastern countries and discharging your nostrils in front of other people is 
exceptionally rude in Japan.
In this chapter I examine the nature of this urge to conform to social norms: 
I explore the reasons people have for acting the same way as each other and 
some ways in which they do so. Think of the wonderful feeling you get look­
ing across a sports stadium and seeing thousands of people dressed in the 
same team colours as you, chanting the same songs. But I don’t ignore the 
darker side of conformity: the dreadful feeling of being the one person in the 
crowd wearing a different colour and singing a different song.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Addressing the Reasons for Social Norms
)>>
Social norms structure every aspect of your life, from the way you lay the 
dinner table, to the number of milliseconds you hold someone’s gaze, to how 
you express condolences. They’re the culture and the habits of life. They’re 
what make foreign countries feel foreign to you, and so are one of the best rea­
sons to travel.
Often, historical reasons reside behind a particular social norm. People drive 
cars on the left in the UK because of the practicalities of wearing a sword. Most 
right-handers wore their swords on the left, and so hundreds of years ago 
people rode horses on the left-hand side of the road to avoid scabbards clash­
ing. People say ‘bless you’ at a sneeze because many years ago it was believed 
that a tiny fraction of the soul was escaping from the body with each sniffle.
The question is, however, now that no one wears a sword for the morning 
commute and few believe that the soul resides in snot, why do these prac­
tices persist?
Although a mass of arbitrary reasons can lie behind individual social norms, 
and people often copy one another simply to create the feeling of belonging, 
sometimes real value exists in imitating those around you: for example, think 
of the first time you went to a sushi restaurant and didn’t know what to do 
with the soy sauce and wasabi. In this section, I discuss three common rea­
sons why people conform to social norms: mimicry, conforming to acquire 
information and conformity to avoid not fitting in.
Doing impressions: The urge to mimic
One reason for the spread and perpetuation of social norms is that human 
beings seem to like copying each other. If you interact with another person 
for more than a few moments, usually you start to speak at the same speed as 
them, use the same words and even pick up a little of their accent. You posi­
tion your body in the same way, crossing your arms or putting your hands in 
your pockets if the other person does. If you’re standing, the chances are that 
you start to sway in time with them.
These movements may be imperceptible to a casual observer, but they can 
be measured in the laboratory. Research even shows that when you call a 
friend in a distant city and you’re both walking and talking on your mobile 
phones, your steps fall in time with each other.
Just how automatic mimicry behaviour is, however, is debated in social psy­
chology. Research is trying to untangle whether people always engage in some 
level of mimicry, or only copy people when they have a particular goal, such

197
 Chapter 13: Getting into Line: Conformity and Social Norms
as impressing them or making friends. What is well established, though, is that 
mimicry seems closely related to feelings of affiliation and liking. People do it 
from very early in life – perhaps as soon as they come out of the womb – and 
mimic each other in every country on earth. I explore mimicry in terms of per­
suasion in more detail in Chapter 14.
The research suggests that mimicry serves as a sort of social group, bond­
ing individuals to each other. If you’ve ever sung with a concert crowd or 
chanted with thousands of football supporters, then you’ve probably experi­
enced the positive feeling of doing the same thing at the same time as a large 
number of people.
)>>
Part of the essence of social interaction for human beings is mimicry of each 
other, and so unsurprisingly habits and norms can spread between people like 
the common cold.
Getting information from others
)>>
Conforming to the behaviour of other people is very useful when you want to 
know something: something called the informational influence of conformity.
If you don’t know how to behave, or if something about the situation is ambig­
uous, you follow others. You’re especially likely to do so if it seems that the 
people around you are experts. For example, you experience a strong pres­
sure to conform on your first day at school when you don’t know where to 
hang your bag and when you travel abroad to an unfamiliar country.
I still have nightmares!
Like many children in England, I was sent off on 
my first day at a new school in a freshly bought 
uniform: a black blazer with school badge, 
black trousers, white or grey itchy nylon shirt 
and a school tie. One reason for the uniform, 
Mum explained, was that children sometimes 
pick on people who are a little bit different. 
A uniform made everyone equal. How little this 
idea underestimated the inventiveness of a 
room full of children.
I immediately discovered that all uniforms 
aren’t created equal. It was absolutely crucial 
that the turn-ups on your trousers were of pre­
cisely the right size. I had a vague idea that this 
was important, and Mum had lovingly stayed 
up the night before stitching a pair into my trou­
sers. To my horror, on the first day I saw that 
mine were almost an inch too short. This was a 
difference of nightmarish magnitude between 
my trousers and those of the effortlessly cool, 
lank-haired boys whom everyone seemed to 
admire.

On my first trip to Tokyo, I found myself staring at the subway map, thinking 
that it looked more like a particularly tricky wiring diagram for a laptop. I had 
no idea what ticket to buy, how to buy it or even where the trains were. So I 
did what you’d probably do in that situation: I copied everyone else and went 
with the flow (and not only metaphorically – the crowds are so dense and 
fast-moving you can just hop into one and get carried along on a stream of 
business suits).
Acknowledging the need to fit in
Even if you’ve always been cool and the centre of your social group, I’m sure 
that you can recall a moment in your life when you panicked and felt the 
pressure to look just like everyone else – most probably at school. Rarely do 
you genuinely feel that one particular item of style or clothing is objectively 
better than any other (if you do, look back at a picture of yourself ten years 
ago, wearing your favourite outfit, and cringe at how strange and awkward it 
looks now). The goal isn’t to do the right thing here; it’s just to do the same 
thing as everyone else.
)>>
Psychologists call this a normative influence of conformity. Your behaviour is 
shaped by the desire to be like those around you. Usually the goal is social 
approval or membership of the in-group that you admire. As I describe in the 
later section of this chapter ‘Facing the Costs of Non-conformity: Ostracism’, 
however, often you’re motivated not so much by a need to fit in, as a fear of 
not fitting in.
Getting Along: Ways People Conform
The textbook definition of conformity is changing your behaviour to match 
the opinions or actions of others. It’s subtly different to other forms of social 
influence that can cause a change in behaviour:
)>>
✓)>>Obedience: When you respond to a direct order from someone in a posi­
tion of authority (see Chapter 12 for more – and that’s an order!). So if a 
teacher tells you to line up at school, that’s obedience.
)>>
✓)>>Compliance: When you make a change in response to direct pressure 
from others. If a school bully threatens you and you hand over your 
lunch money, that’s compliance.
But if you spend your school lunch hour stapling your trouser turn-ups so 
that they’re the same length as everyone else’s, that’s conformity.
In this section, I examine some of the ways in which people seek to conform.

 Chapter 13: Getting into Line: Conformity and Social Norms
Absorbing other people’s opinions
When people live in a community, they tend to share beliefs and opinions. 
Of course, not every agrees all the time, but there is a tendency for opinions 
to conform. This is one reason (though there are others) that political maps 
of the country coloured by voting patterns tend to be reasonably similar 
between elections. Of course, some places switch from red to blue, but many 
areas are stable across the years in terms of political preferences.
Untangling the reasons for this conformity in opinion is very complicated. 
Social psychologists have studied the phenomenon in field studies of col­
lege students. They are a good test case since students come from all over 
the country, live together for three or four years, and then (usually) leave. 
Psychologists have tracked how students’ opinions shift as a result of living 
together for this short period of time.
Bennington College, for example, is a liberal arts college in Vermont with the 
reputation of employing academics who are to the left of the political spec­
trum in the United States. A researcher studied the progression of students’ 
political views in the 1930s at Bennington, from the moment that they first 
turned up at the college through to their graduation. Each year that the stu­
dents stayed on the campus, their political views crept further and further to 
the left. This was one of the first detailed scientific studies of conformity in 
political opinions emerging over time.
Aligning your perception with others
You may come to share your friends or your family’s political opinions for 
many reasons. Late night debates or a set of common experiences may 
have persuaded you that what the people around you think is simply the 
right vview. Social psychologists have found that conformity runs much 
deeper than this, however. In some situations people will believe that they 
see the same thing as other people: not because it is the right thing to see, 
or because they have been explicitly persuaded, but because that’s simply 
what everyone else sees. Remarkably, there is a normative influence of con­
formity on your perception. This was shown by social psychologist Muzafer 
Sherif using a simple visual illusion.

Try and block out all sources of light in your room at night. As you sit in the 
darkness, look for a small standby light on your TV or computer. Stare at it 
for a few minutes. After a while, if the room is dark enough, the dot seems to 
move. This effect is a simple visual illusion (see the nearby sidebar ‘Watching 
stars move: The autokinetic effect’ if you want the scientific background).

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Now invite some friends into your dark room to look for the ‘mysterious 
moving dot’. After a few minutes, turn the lights back on and ask them each to 
state how far they thought the dot had moved in inches. You get a variety of 
estimates. If they’re willing, ask them back over the course of several nights to 
repeat the experiment. As you collect their estimates you’ll notice a strange 
phenomenon, as did Muzafer Sharif in 1935 in his early experiments on confor­
mity. Your friends’ estimates become more and more similar to one another.
Even though the light never physically moved, our brains get confused in the 
darkness and perceive motion. If you demonstrated the autokinetic effect sev­
eral times to a hundred people, and then asked them to tell you in private what 
direction they saw the dot move, you’d get a hundred slightly different answers. 
But if the people are in a room together and say what they saw out loud, then 
after several demonstrations they would start to say the same direction.
By the end they’re making very similar estimates, fully conforming in their 
perception of the non-existing motion of the mysterious dot. It seems like 
a strange sort of mass hallucination, but it’s just the effect of conformity of 
visual perception.
Choosing to conform over 
choosing to be right
The preceding sections reveal that people soak up the opinions of people 
around them, and that faced with a mysterious visual illusion, they are 
swayed by the experiences of others. Conformity can nudge people in a cer­
tain direction perhaps, but in neither of these cases is it a force encountering 
much resistance. In this section, I want to look at a normative influence of 
conformity that pushes you in a direction that you know is wrong.
Watching stars move: The autokinetic effect
If your eyes have no reference frame, such as 
the dim shape of other objects or the outline of 
your window, your brain gets easily confused. 
It can mistake, for example, tiny movements of 
your head and body for potential movements 
of the light floating in space. This is called the 
autokinetic effect. It was first documented in 
1799 by an explorer as he looked at the stars 
through a telescope. However, he thought 
that the stars really were swinging, and it was 
another 50 years before people realised that it 
was just a trick of the mind.

 Chapter 13: Getting into Line: Conformity and Social Norms
The psychologist Solomon Asch asked participants to make a simple judge­
ment. He showed them a black line drawn on a large piece of card, next to 
three other lines labelled A, B and C. The participant’s job was simply to say 
which of the three lines was the same length as the first. It wasn’t a hard call: 
a pigeon could figure this out. When asked alone, in the control condition, 
everyone got the answer correct almost all the time. But what if the partici­
pant wasn’t alone?
In Asch’s experiments, the participant was just one person in a room full 
of other people who were also present to do the same line-estimation task. 
Except that they weren’t just other people, they were confederates of the 
experimenter. The participant, like Jim Carrey’s character in the film The 
Truman Show, was the only person who wasn’t following a script.
)>>
Imagine you’re in this experiment. The researcher presents the lines to the 
room full of people. You can immediately see that the correct answer is B. 
The experimenter goes round the room and asks each person in turn for their 
answer. The first guy says, ‘Uhh, I think it’s A.’ You snigger to yourself – what 
an idiot! Then the second person says, ‘Yep, A.’ You wipe your glasses and 
squint again. It really looks like B. But the third, fourth and fifth people assert 
confidently that A is the correct answer. And now, the whole room is looking at 
you for your answer. ‘A, I guess,’ you mumble.
Even though the correct answer couldn’t be plainer in Asch’s experiments, 
many people conform to the majority’s blatantly wrong view. It seems very 
strange that the participants in this experiment wouldn’t raise their hands 
and disagree with the other people in the room. In the next section, I look in 
more detail at one of the forces that compels conformity in such situations – 
the fear of standing out from the crowd.
Facing the Costs of Non-conformity: 
Ostracism
Culturally, the public seem to prize rebels and outsiders and scorn the fol­
lowers and ‘sheep’. Independence of thought and spirit always win the day in 
films and novels, with the message often being that you have to stand up for 
what you believe in, no matter what. When did you last see a Hollywood film 
end with rousing speeches or tear-flecked moments after the lead characters 
decide to do what everyone else does?

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Instead, you see the same story a hundred times in different guises, whether it’s 
set in a small-town high school or a space station in a distant galaxy (I lay out 
my own pitch for my Hollywood epic in the nearby sidebar ‘Cultural rebels’).
)>>
With the huge impact that the entertainment media has, you’d think that 
people’s everyday attitudes would reflect what they value in books and films, 
but in fact, in real life, they don’t really like rebels. They hate people who think 
and act differently to themselves.
In this section, I look at what happens to people when they are left out of the 
group. The technical term for this is ostracism. Psychologists think that fear 
of ostracism is one of the reasons that people are so eager to conform to 
each other’s behaviour and beliefs. Ostracism is a possible consequence of 
non-conformity, and people will do anything they can to avoid it.
Ancient Greeks and reality TV
As well as inventing democracy, the Olympics 
and philosophy, the Ancient Greeks are 
responsible for one of the key aspects of real­
ity TV shows like Survivor: the moment at the 
end of each episode when the contestants get 
together and vote one of their members out of 
the competition. The psychological term ostra­
cism actually comes from the word ostrakon, 
which was a little shard of pottery that the 
ancient Greeks used as scrap paper. Every 
year, the Greeks got together and everyone 
scratched the name of someone that they dis­
liked or mistrusted on a shard of pottery. The 
shards were then counted, and the ‘winner’ 
got banned from the city for ten years. So as 
well as giving birth to reality TV, the Greeks had 
realised that being shut out from others is a ter­
rible social punishment.
Cultural rebels
Films often feature one person who’s a little dif­
ferent: he wears different clothes, has a differ­
ent attitude and doesn’t join in with the others. 
He’s an outsider, a rebel. He thinks that being 
a ballet dancer or friends with the aliens is 
cool. The other students, townsfolk or space 
cadets don’t trust him. They make fun, push 
him around and don’t invite him to their parties. 
Maybe one girl’s curious about him and thinks 
that he’s misunderstood and complicated (she 
probably wears glasses to indicate her intelli­
gent insight).
Then some crisis happens – the lead actor in 
the school play breaks his leg or the aliens 
attack – and the girl with the glasses convinces 
people that they need the outsider. He saves the 
day, the girl stops wearing glasses (to show that 
she’s loveable as well as smart!) and every­
one’s happy.

 Chapter 13: Getting into Line: Conformity and Social Norms
Admitting that no one likes a real-life rebel
Researchers have found that, in general, when a member of a group says or 
does something different – when they don’t conform – the other people in the 
group lower their opinions of that individual.
Despite some exceptions, generally you incur a cost for your non-conformity: 
many people simply don’t like you and can reject or exclude you from the 
social group. Psychologists have studied the psychological effects of ostra­
cism in some clever experiments.
)>>
Next time you’re out with a group of people, talking about this and that, try a 
little experiment: disagree with people. Whenever someone gives a point of 
view or an opinion, rather than murmuring agreement, try gently, politely and 
respectfully putting an opposing view. The people around you may exhibit 
a new-found respect for your opinions and independence of mind, but more 
likely, sadly, they just think that you’re a bit of a pain.
Feeling left out: The pain of ostracism
If you are forced out of a social group, it hurts. I mean that almost literally; 
social psychologists talk of the ‘social pain’ of ostracism, and there is some 
evidence that I discuss below that suggests that social pain is a lot like real 
pain in terms of how the brain responds. Just like the pain of being punched by 
the school bully is one reason you might comply with his requests, the social 
pain of being ostracised is one reason that people conform to social norms.
One day, a researcher called Kip Williams was relaxing in a park in San 
Francisco. The weather was fine and lots of people were out enjoying the 
sunshine. Then a frisbee dropped out of the sky and landed beside him. Kip 
picked it up, looked around him and saw two men waving at him. Gamely, he 
threw it back to one of them. They gestured in thanks, and then one of the 
men threw it back to Kip.
He happily tossed it back, and for a few moments they played a three-way 
game. Then the two men threw it between themselves for a couple of turns. 
Then a couple more. Then they seemed to forget about Kip, who stood awk­
wardly, looking between the two men now playing frisbee just with each 
other. At this moment, Kip says he felt a profound sense of hurt and loss. 
Moments ago he’d been involved in a fun, spontaneous game with two people, 
and now, they’d rejected him! I imagine him pretending to check his watch, 
nodding to the men and walking away, trying not to let his shoulders slump.
Luckily, Kip had two insights. First, it was just a game of frisbee and the two 
men had gone out to play with each other and not him. Second, because this 
little interaction was able to produce a strong emotion in him, it could be an 
ideal way to study social rejection in the laboratory.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Williams went on to invent the Cyberball experiments, in which he and his 
colleagues introduce participants to a very simple computer game. Three 
stick figures are on the screen and participants can control the one at the 
bottom. A frisbee flies between the characters, and when it flies towards your 
stick figure, you catch it. Then you can press one of two buttons to throw it 
to the stick figure on the left or on the right. It’s hardly Grand Theft Auto, but 
people seem to like playing the game.
What’s interesting about Cyberball is that other people are controlling the 
other two stick figures from across the Internet. You see a little picture of 
their faces on screen, and the computer tells you their names and sometimes 
something about them. Only, of course, they don’t really exist: this is a social 
psychology experiment and, in fact, only the computer is controlling the 
other ‘players’. This set-up allows Kip Williams to re-create the experience he 
had at the park in the laboratory.
The players start off throwing the frisbee to you, as well as to each other. 
Then gradually, they start to favour each other, and after a few more turns 
no one is throwing the frisbee to you at all. Then the experimenter asks how 
you feel. Just imagining this situation, you may think, ‘I wouldn’t care in the 
­slightest – it’s just a stupid game’. But in fact, you’ve absorbed just enough 
information about the other players and just enough interaction between 
you all that – when you’re shut out – it feels like a genuine social exclusion. 
You’ve been ostracised, which impairs self-esteem, lowers happiness and 
reduces your sense of belonging.
)>>
The researchers wondered whether the identity of the other players matters. 
Are your feelings only hurt if these are people you really want to be friends 
with? Remarkably, not. In one surprising experiment, the researchers intro­
duced participants to other players and said that they were members of the Ku 
Klux Klan. This far-right, racist group is an anathema to most Americans and 
to all the participants in the experiments. The amazing thing is that even if the 
participants were playing imaginary frisbee with some of the most unpleasant 
people in the country, their feelings were still hurt when they were excluded.
More remarkably, participants have been given the Cyberball game to play in 
a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. In the moment they were ostra­
cised, brain regions were active that have a lot in common with the regions that 
respond to physical pain – in the anterior cingulate cortex, in case you won­
dered. In other words, the researcher claimed that the pain of ostracism is real.
I think that these results are very provocative when you think about their 
wider implications. The ancient Greeks realised the power of the punishment 
of ostracism (see the sidebar ‘Ancient Greeks and reality TV’), but I think that 
we tend to overlook it today. Perhaps it’s because we tend to think of ourselves 
as proud individuals, we neglect the rewards that come from feeling part of a 
group and underestimate the punishment that comes from feeling excluded.

hat comes to mind when you think of a great act of persuasion? 
Martin Luther King’s ‘I have a dream’ civil rights speech? Winston 
Churchill’s radio broadcasts exhorting the nation to ‘fight on the beaches’ 
and resist Nazi attacks? These are powerful examples of how words can move 
people and change minds, but I don’t think that they are the best examples 
of the acts of persuasion that swirl around our everyday lives. As I explain in 
this chapter, we are barely aware of some of the most potent means of per­
suasion that exert their influence upon us.
Commercial companies are experts at persuasion. For example, Procter & 
Gamble (P&G) make medicines, beauty products and a whole range of house­
hold goods. In 2012 the company spent $2 billion on research and develop­
ment, trying to create products that are better than those of its competitors. 
Nothing surprising there, you may think. But what may surprise you is that it 
spent more than four times that amount trying to persuade you that its prod­
ucts are better than those of its competitors.
P&G is the largest advertiser on the planet. The $9 billion it spent on adver­
tising is more than many countries spend on roads, armies, hospitals and 
schools. The firm spent it on billboards, TV slots and those little sachets of 
perfume that fall out of magazines.
In this chapter I investigate the techniques and psychology of persuasion. Of 
course, persuasion is used in all sorts of areas in society and relationships, 
and I choose to focus mainly on how companies and salespeople persuade

you to change your mind, take a particular course of action or buy a product. 
I reveal some different routes to persuasion, such as emotional appeals, intel­
lectual arguments and subliminal perception.
I also describe six different principles of persuasion, each based on the types 
of psychological evidence that I cover throughout this book. Each principle 
leads to one or more techniques of persuasion that you can use on other 
people, or recognise when they’re being used on you. By providing knowledge 
of these tricks I hope to give you some protection against these dark arts.
And so ends my attempt to persuade you to read this chapter!
Walking the Routes to Persuasion
Social psychologists talk about two ‘routes’ to persuasion. They mean that 
there are two different lines of attack that people can use to try and change 
your mind. These two routes differ in the ways that they require you to pro­
cess mentally a persuasive message such as an argument, an advert or a 
sales pitch.
)>>
✓)>>Deep processing: This requires the target of the persuasion to think 
carefully about the information in the message, using reasoned analysis 
and deliberation.
)>>
✓)>>Shallow processing: This does not require the target of the persuasion 
to think very deeply at all about the content of the message, or even pay 
much attention to it. Here, shallow, superficial factors do the work, like 
the fact that the salesperson is attractive or the brand is familiar.
Although people most commonly think of persuasion as deep processing, it is 
actually shallow processing that is the more common – and more powerful – 
way to influence behaviour. Recently, for example, Facebook started inserting 
advertisements in the middle of users’ webpages. Previously, adverts had 
been more discreet, off to the side. Many users didn’t like this change and, 
on principle, refused to click on the ads. If no one clicked on the advertised 
links, they reasoned, Facebook wouldn’t make money off them and they 
might abandon the practice.
Despite being a noble aim, this approach displays a fundamental misunder­
standing of the psychology behind the ads. The truth is that Facebook never 
expected anyone to click on the advertisements: that’s not how they work.
www.it-ebooks.info

207
 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
)>>
Deep processing is how users thought that the new ads appearing on Facebook 
were designed to work: people see an advert, read the testimonials, look at the 
price and click to buy the product. Sadly, people rarely make choices this way. 
Most persuasion uses the subtler shallow processing, like the Facebook ads.
Facebook doesn’t place these adverts because it thinks that you’re going 
to read them and click on them. All the company wants is to expose you to 
those product brands and images. As I discuss in Chapter 5, the more times 
you’re exposed to something, in general the more you like it. Everyone is 
swayed by superficial processing, such as the familiarity of an image. So even 
though you can ignore the adverts sniffily, by simply being in front of your 
eyeballs, they’re doing their work.
Considering arguments rationally: 
Deep processing
The deep processing form of persuasion involves an argument, a discussion, 
some evidence and a reasoned decision. For example, someone tells you 
about a great car that’s for sale and says that the price is good. You weigh the 
evidence, check the prices, assess the argument and make your choice to buy.
Deep processing is so named because the target of the persuasion is assumed 
to be using all the information available to come to a rational, considered 
choice. Deep processing is the basis for televised debates between politicians, 
where you can hear everyone’s argument and make your judgement. It’s how 
people like to think that they make choices, as rational consumers. Deep pro­
cessing, when it works, tends to produce real and lasting opinion change.
Being swayed by appearances: 
Shallow processing
With shallow processing you’re influenced by the superficial properties of 
the message or the communicator: the height of the political candidate, how 
attractive the salesperson is and so on.
Shallow processing doesn’t produce deep, lasting opinion change: you won’t 
persuade someone to change strongly held political convictions or to fall in 
love with you this way. The effects of shallow processing are more ephem­
eral. But they can sway a floating voter or nudge a consumer towards one 
product or another.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Celebrity endorsements trade on shallow processing. No one would seriously 
ask actors or footballers for their advice on what home insurance or mobile 
phone to purchase. All that matters is that you have a positive view of the 
celebrities used and that positive effect is transferred to the product they’re 
selling.

✓)>>I am always punctual.
)>>
✓)>>I reliably turn up on time to my appointments.
A moment’s thought, or any deep processing, leads you to conclude that 
these two people have exactly equal qualities. But research shows that when 
presented with two options, people are swayed by simple things such as the 
number of bullet points in support of each person; even when those bullet 
points say exactly the same thing, as they do with these candidates.
)>>
Next time you see an advert listing the benefits of an insurance policy, note 
how many times almost exactly the same points are listed in different places.
Appealing to emotions
Detailed arguments that rely on deep processing can include emotional 
appeals, like the political speeches of Martin Luther King or Churchill. Social 
psychologists term appeals to emotion as shallow processing, however, as 
they are often not directly related to the content of the persuasive message.
www.it-ebooks.info

209
 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
Positive emotions
The most common emotional appeal is simply to make people happy, with 
the intention that the positive emotion will become associated with the 
brand that is being sold. Advertisements that use humour, for example, aim 
to make you think more positively about their products because of the small 
smile that they evoke with a funny video of a kitten. Or during a large sport­
ing event like the Olympics, companies are very eager to associate their 
names with particular teams or athletes, so that the warm glow their sup­
porters feel will become tied to a particular dish, soap or shampoo. It doesn’t 
matter that the sport has nothing to do with the product – all that the adver­
tisers want is to build an association between the positive emotion and their 
brand.
One social psychologist I know used this principle to her advantage. When 
the time came to hand out her teaching evaluations to the students in her 
class, she taped a candy to each form. The students sucked on the sweets 
while evaluating her teaching, and the mild happiness caused by the sugary 
treat ensured that she got some of the best ratings in the department.
Negative emotions
Sometimes persuaders will try and evoke negative feelings such as fear to 
exploit the shallow processing of their targets. The most common example is 
attack ads in political campaigns that suggest horrible things will happen if 
one candidate is elected.
There is a risk to evoking negative emotions however, as they can easily 
backfire. The danger is that the negative emotion becomes associated with 
the persuader and turns people off. For example, many early advertisements 
and campaigns about global warming used the most shocking images and sta­
tistics about impending climate disasters. It seems that in many cases these 
tactics scared people to the extent that they simply didn’t want to know 
about global warming – or actively denied it – because it was too horrible to 
think about.
Luckily, later campaigners realised this strategic error. If you watch Al Gore’s 
film An Inconvenient Truth, for example, you’ll see that every alarming statis­
tic is immediately followed by a small, practical step that people can do, such 
as swapping their old light bulbs for energy efficient ones. In this way, the 
negative emotion evoked by the message is connected to positive action that 
people can take, and they are less likely to be overwhelmed and turned off by 
the fear that nothing can be done.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Recognising the Six Principles 
of Persuasion
Robert Cialdini has researched and written extensively on the science of per­
suasion. In this section I describe the six principles of persuasion he identi­
fies that are used on you every day by advertisers, salespeople and probably 
even your friends and family.
)>>
Many of these six principles rely on biases in your thinking or psychological 
mechanisms. Each one works because it plugs into important psychological 
needs, such as having accurate beliefs about the world, being liked by other 
people and feeling good about yourself. None of these goals is a bad thing for 
you to pursue, but they do leave you vulnerable to sneaky persuasion experts 
who can turn them against you.
‘I scratch your back . . .’: The urge 
to reciprocate
Reciprocity is the social norm that if I do something for you, you should do 
something for me (I talk more about social norms in Chapter 13). It exists in 
every human culture, can be seen in the earliest moments of childhood social 
interaction and even has its own song in the musical Chicago. It’s so ingrained 
that if someone gives you something – even something you didn’t really want – 
not giving something back can be surprisingly difficult.
The house always wins
Casino companies take the principle of reci­
procity to remarkable extremes. Most casinos 
now have their customers use loyalty cards 
so that they can track their every transaction. 
They identify their most profitable customers 
and when these people have a big win, casinos 
offer them free rooms in the hotel and compli­
mentary meals in the restaurant. In some cases 
they even pay for plane tickets for the whole 
family to fly to Las Vegas so ‘your loved ones 
can help you celebrate your good fortune’.
After the customers accept this generosity 
from the casino, the norm of reciprocity kicks in 
and they feel compelled to spend at least some 
of the winnings back at the casino. Eventually, 
the customer’s big win ends up back in the 
casino vault.

 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
)>>
Whenever you get something for free, you can bet that someone’s trying to 
hook you with the norm of reciprocity. Little samples of food given out in a 
supermarket, the complimentary address labels a charity sends you, the per­
formance put on for you by a street artist – in all these cases, after receiving 
the ‘free’ gift, people are more likely to purchase the full product, donate to 
the charity or put money in the hat.
‘You really know your stuff!’: 
Being consistent
People need to feel that they’re consistent. Holding two beliefs that contra­
dict each other causes psychological discomfort, and people often change 
their views, or act differently, to resolve that inconsistency. (This tendency 
is the cornerstone of cognitive dissonance, which I discuss in Chapter 6.) 
To expert persuaders, your need to feel consistent is one of your biggest 
weaknesses.
)>>
Imagine walking into an electronics shop, browsing for a new TV. A salesperson 
sidles up and you start talking. You mumble something about high-definition 
screens and the salesperson says, ‘Ah, I see that you’re a bit of an expert on 
TVs.’ He shows you a few TV sets and you express a preference for one. ‘Wow, 
you’ve got a good eye for quality,’ he replies.
Eventually, your decision comes down to a decision between a cheap TV that 
does what you want or a much more expensive model with extra features. 
Which do you choose? Well, what would technology experts with discerning 
eyes for quality do? They’d pick the more expensive model, which is what 
you do too. Sale made!
Labelling
When making flattering comments about your knowledge and taste, the 
salesperson isn’t just trying to ingratiate himself: he’s doing something 
called labelling: he’s assigning positive characteristics to you. When you 
have to make a decision, your need to behave consistently means that you 
act according to those labels, and you’ve played right into his commission-
earning hands.
)>>
The same trick works well with children. One day my son spotted his baby 
brother playing with his favourite toy car. He grabbed it back, causing the 
smaller one to cry. Instead of lecturing him on the virtues of sharing, I tried a 
different tactic. ‘Sam, you’re so good at sharing with your brother,’ I told him. 
www.it-ebooks.info

212
Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
He agreed modestly, accepting the label. Then he looked down at the toy car, 
shrugged and handed it back to his little brother with a pat on his head. Try it 
out: it really works!
Foot-in-the-door technique
People need consistent beliefs and consistent behaviour; experts can easily 
exploit these needs with the foot-in-the-door technique. If you get people to 
agree to a small request first, they later agree to your greater request simply 
to be consistent.
The researchers Jonathan Freedman and Scott Fraser demonstrated this in 
an elegant experiment in the 1960s. First, they went door-to-door in a subur­
ban area, asking people if they’d agree to put a large sign on their lawns that 
said ‘Drive Safely’. It was a sentiment that most agreed with, but the sign was 
pretty ugly. Only 17 per cent of people agreed to put it up.
The researchers then tried the foot-in-the-door technique. They went round 
another set of households, but asked instead for people to put a small sign 
in their windows that said, ‘Be a safe driver’. It was unobtrusive and most 
people complied with this small request. Then a week later the researchers 
returned. They asked people if they’d mind putting the large ugly sign on 
their lawns. Remarkably, 76 per cent of people agreed.
Over four times as many people agreed to the exact same large request if 
they’d previously agreed to a small request. The reason was consistency. By 
agreeing to put up the small sign, the home owners had shown that they were 
concerned about safe driving, and that they were prepared to do something 
about it. After that, they risked seeming inconsistent if they said no, even if 
the sign was unattractive.

This result is counter-intuitive. It shows that you can increase your chances of 
persuading people to do something if you increase your total demands upon 
them.
The trick is well known by the people in coloured anoraks who patrol the 
Tube station near my office. The local name for them is chuggers, which is 
short for ‘charity muggers’. They stand on the street corners, talk to passers-
by and attempt to persuade them to sign up for a regular donation to a par­
ticular charity. The charity and the colour of the anoraks change each week, 
because the chuggers don’t work for any charity directly. They work for a 
company that takes a small percentage profit out of every charity donation 
made. The people in anoraks are real persuasion professionals and experts in 
the foot-in-the-door technique.

 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
They approach you in a friendly, engaging manner. They say, ‘Hello! Do you 
have a few moments to talk about child poverty/cruelty to animals/homeless­
ness?’ Of course, all reasonable, nice people can spare a few minutes just 
to talk. So you stop and chat, and after a few moments conversation about 
the issue, the chuggers ask a big favour – ‘Can you sign this petition for me?’ 
You’d seem highly inconsistent to say no at this point. You’ve already spent 
several minutes listening and agreeing to what’s being said. It costs you noth­
ing to scrawl your name next to a statement you’ve been nodding along to all 
this time. As you’re signing, the chuggers talk more and more about the need 
for your support. Then they pop the big question – ‘Will you sign up to make 
a small monthly donation?’
By this point you’d seem highly inconsistent, not to say stingy and hypocriti­
cal, if you say no. After all, you’ve already given your time, your verbal agree­
ment and you’ve even signed a statement saying how important this issue is 
for you.
Chuggers start with a tiny request, and you keep agreeing as the requests get 
bigger and bigger. Because of your need to be consistent, they basically had 
your money at ‘Hello’.
The low-ball and bait-and-switch techniques
These techniques induce customers to make the first step towards buying a 
product and then change the deal. But because customers need to feel con­
sistent, they follow through with the purchase regardless. In the low-ball tech­
nique, a very low price is advertised.
For example: you see a plane ticket advertised to Paris for £10. This seems 
like a great deal, and so you call up the ticket office. You find an available 
ticket on the day you want and reserve the seat. And then the salesperson 
reminds you of the baggage fee of £20 and airport tax of £40. Plus, you have 
to buy a return ticket too, which is £80, and another airport tax of £40. So in 
all, the ticket is £190 and more expensive than others you saw advertised 
originally. But, because you’ve committed to buying by phoning up the ticket 
office with your credit card in hand, and because you committed to a time 
and a day, you follow through and buy the ticket.
)>>
The bait-and-switch is even more brazen. Here, you go into a shop because you 
saw a great deal advertised on a laptop. But the salesperson sadly shakes his 
head and tells you that model has sold out. But he does have other laptops in 
stock if you’re interested, though they aren’t at such a good price. But because 
you travelled all the way to that particular shop and told the salesperson you 
were there to buy a computer, the only consistent thing seems to be to follow 
through and buy one. Even if it’s not the one you wanted, at a price higher 
than you wanted to pay. But at least you were consistent.

Part IV: Comprehending Social Influence 
Nine out of ten advertisers use social proof
You don’t buy a fridge very often – perhaps a couple of times in your life. 
So you probably don’t know about the latest trends in consumer refrigera­
tion. But when you come to buy one, you ask your friends and family, or look 
online and read the reviews of other users. Your goal is to gain accurate infor­
mation about the refrigerator world.
)>>
One readily available source of information is the behaviour and opinions of 
other people – called social proof – and it’s a powerful persuasive force that 
experts can manipulate.
The most obvious way, for example, for a restaurant to exploit this principle 
for persuasion online is to write its own user reviews. If you flick through 
restaurant reviews online, you can easily spot the reviews made up by the 
owners. They have better grammar and spelling and use phrases that regular 
human beings don’t use (‘the stunning decor was out of this world and our 
charming hosts catered to our every culinary desire’).
Social proof can be done more subtly of course. You’ve probably heard the 
advice to eat only at busy restaurants, or to choose the Chinese restaurants 
that Chinese people go to. Here you’re drawing on the opinions of others and 
the people who’re experts in that cuisine. Restaurant owners are well aware 
of this tactic and seat people (especially attractive people) at key spots near 
the windows to attract other customers.
)>>
You don’t have to see people behaving in a certain way to follow their exam­
ple. Think of a bar that has a jar labelled ‘tips’. When you pay, do you put 
money in it? Research shows that you’re much more likely to if it’s already 
stuffed with bills and coins, because that’s ‘evidence’ that other people have 
tipped and so should you. This tendency has been shown by careful research, 
but waiting staff have always known it. They even have an expression for put­
ting their own money in at the start of the night: ‘salting the jar’.
The same effect is used in the way that some TV shows are broadcast. It’s 
becoming a thing of the past (thankfully), but many sitcoms have a laughter 
track dubbed on top. You may think that finding something funny or not is a 
pretty individual thing. Yet research shows that the laughter of other people 
is a strong determinate of whether you find something funny. You don’t 
even have to hear the laughter. In one study, people sat alone in a room and 
watched a clip of the comedian Bill Cosby. The amount that they laughed 
increased when they were told that a friend was sitting next door watching 
the same clip.

 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
The most obvious use of social proof in persuasion is marketing slogans of 
the form ‘Eight out of ten cats prefer . . . ’. You see this technique all the time, 
often with a group of experts polled: for example, ‘Over 90 per cent of den­
tists use our brushes in their own homes’, or a brand proclaiming itself the 
‘UK’s number one choice’.
‘What a coincidence, me too!’: 
The desire to be liked
Humans are socially needy creatures, constantly wanting to affirm and 
strengthen social bonds. If a friend asks you a favour, you say yes. If someone 
seems as if he may become a friend, you often also say yes. Favours are a 
sort of glue for social relationships. Persuasion experts have realised that if 
they can pretend to be your friends, you’re more likely to buy from them.
Salespeople use subtle techniques to manipulate you into liking them. As you 
can see in Chapter 15, certain factors make people like each other, but the 
most pervasive is similarity. You like people who are like you. This doesn’t 
just mean things such as age and appearance, but more subtle aspects of 
behaviour as well.
)>>
If you gently mimic the manner of speaking, posture and body language of 
people, they tend to like you more (unless they catch you doing it, when they 
find it a bit creepy). Research found that waiting staff in restaurants dramati­
cally increase their tips when they simply copy the way that a customer 
places an order.
Therefore, when you talk to salespeople, you may find that you have a sur­
prising amount in common. Perhaps they’re students too, or were recently, 
and studied a subject close to yours. Maybe they too like travelling or going 
to concerts. If you’re a little older, you may find that (surprise, surprise) they 
have children about the same age as yours.
This sales technique is particular noticeable in phone sales. When you talk to 
salespeople on the phone they’re often following a script that instructs them 
to find common areas between them and you.
)>>
Next time you get called up, try dropping into the conversation something 
random, like you love yachting, or shift your accent and manner of speaking. 
Pretty soon you may find that they too go sailing and come from Yorkshire!

‘Trust me and my white coat’: Responding 
to authority figures
No matter how independently minded you think you are, you’re still sus­
ceptible to the authority of other people. In Chapter 12 I discuss experi­
ments demonstrating the remarkable obedience that people show towards 
people in authority. Of course, no one advertises their products by having 
an authority figure order people around: authority exerts an influence in a 
more subtle way.
)>>
Imagine an advert for a new vitamin supplement. Someone on-screen is tell­
ing you about the product. What is the person like? My guess is male, tall, 
attractive, well-groomed, wearing a white coat, a crisp blue shirt and glasses 
with thin wire frames. The age is important – old enough to look like he’s near 
the top of his profession, but young enough that he’s up on the very latest 
research. My guess would be late thirties or early forties.
Right now, I’m writing this sitting on a London Underground train, looking at 
two such gentlemen advertising vitamins and a new type of toothpaste.
The advertisers are tapping into your stereotype of a medical expert – someone 
with experience and training, who can speak with knowledge about the virtues 
of this product. By reflecting your authority stereotype the advert is more likely 
to exert an influence over your choices.
‘Don’t delay, call today’: Implying scarcity
Advertisers often use the notion that if something is scarce, and other people 
seem to want it, it must be valuable.
Here’s an apocryphal story, usually set in Soviet-era Russia. A lady walks past 
a long queue at a shop and joins the line. Another lady stops and asks, ‘What 
are you queuing for?’. ‘I have no idea,’ the first lady replies, ‘but it must be 
worth it!’.
)>>
This method of persuasion is especially easy to spot. You see many adverts 
screaming ‘sale must end today!’, ‘limited time offer!’ or ‘last one in stock!’ 
Hotel bargain websites are particularly adept at supplying all sorts of ‘informa­
tion’ about the number of people who’ve just bought a room and the rapidly 
diminishing (usually between one and four) number of rooms remaining at 
that price. All you need to do is click right now to book (without taking the 
time to comparison-shop) and you can grab a ‘bargain’.

 Chapter 14: Persuading People to Part with Their Pounds
Combating Persuasion: Resistance 
Isn’t Always Useless
Like all humans, you’re very susceptible to social influence. This is no bad 
thing. It’s part of your heritage as a member of a species that has evolved in 
large social groups. But it does mean that persuasion professionals can turn 
many of your mental quirks and biases against you. Although you can never 
fully reduce their influence over your decisions, detailed knowledge of their 
tricks does give you some protection.
Sometimes this is easy, as persuaders overplay their hand. For example, the 
Chancellor George Osborne turned up at the opening ceremony of the London 
Olympics that celebrated British institutions such as the National Health 
Service. But when the stadium screen showed an image of him, the crowd 
spontaneously started booing, recognising his blatant attempt to associate 
himself with national pride in the NHS, when at the time he was responsible 
for cutting its funding.
)>>
With more subtle attempts at persuasion, the best defence is to recognise 
the tricks and manipulations that are being used against you. For example, 
I can now deal with the chuggers and their foot-in-the-door technique: I give 
a cheery hello and agree that homelessness or whatever is important. I can 
then ignore the pangs of guilt as I keep on walking, since I promise myself 
to read up on the charity by myself later, when I’m away from the manipula­
tion of the chugger. Plus, when a salesperson doesn’t have the product that 
the shop advertised on sale, I suspect the bait-and-switch technique and try 
another store.
The one thing I’m powerless against, however, is the norm of reciprocity. 
Giving out free food samples just seems so nice that I always come away with 
a basket full of overpriced delicacies!

to look pre-pubescent. Through most of human history, younger females tended to be 
more fertile and have healthier babies. The claim is that men have evolved to be most 
attracted to sexually mature women who’re young enough to still have the facial charac­
teristics of girls.
)>>
✓)>> What women want: As well as symmetry, the features in men that are typically attractive 
to females are a wide, strong jaw and jutting forehead, features corresponding to high 
levels of testosterone. Men with higher testosterone are more likely to have more 
resources and more ability to defend their families.

people like people who are like them.

uman beings aren’t meant to be alone. The fact that solitary confine­
ment is the worst punishment that the UK’s legal system can inflict is 
no coincidence. Humans evolved as a social species, living in small groups 
of perhaps 100 to 150. Since the first cities 6,000 years ago, people have lived 
in even larger populations than that, and yet their social worlds seem to 
have remained around the same size. Echoing the past, the average number 
of Facebook friends is around 150. Among this social network, the domi­
nant topic of conversation (the very reason, for example, that Facebook 
was started) is who’s hot and who’s not, who’s dating whom and who’s just 
broken up.
In this chapter, I talk about the psychological forces that shape positive rela­
tionships. I discuss the bond you feel with the people who raised you as a 
child and what it reveals about your relationships as an adult. I explore the 
social forces behind your attraction to some people and not others, and why 
the people you like tend to be of the same sex. Plus, I don’t neglect relation­
ships with people you don’t necessarily like or lust after but nevertheless 
have to share the planet with, because social forces shape your interactions 
with neighbours, peers, colleagues and bosses as well. To this end, I also take 
a brief look at social hierarchies, power and status.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Considering an Evolutionary 
Perspective on Attraction
Evolutionary psychology, which I describe in detail in Chapter 2, has more 
to say about attraction, love and sex than any other subject: it’s really the 
Cosmopolitan of scientific disciplines! Although every aspect of human behav­
iour evolved in some way, mating behaviour is where the evolutionary pres­
sures show their hand most clearly, because the choice of mate is the activity 
through which genes are passed on.
Evolutionary psychology and politics
One particular step in any argument about 
human behaviour, which is important but seems 
so small or innocuous that often people don’t 
notice when someone makes it, is the step 
from talking about what people actually do and 
what they should do. Usually this step is hidden 
behind the skirts of one particular word: a dis­
cussion of what’s natural for people to do.
Ironically, given the frequent antagonism of sci­
ence and the Church, this (mis)application of 
evolutionary theory has an ancestor in Christian 
theology. The idea is called natural law, and in 
simple terms it states that what most people 
do must be what God intended, is natural and 
therefore should be part of people’s ethical 
code. So, for example, throughout the human 
and animal kingdom people observed that pair 
bonds most commonly happen between a man 
and a woman. Therefore, the conclusion was 
made that this is natural and right, and homo­
sexual relationships are unnatural and wrong 
(this argument works only if you ignore all the 
cases of homosexual activity in other animals 
and other human cultures, of course).
You can hear the same natural law line of 
reasoning now applied from an evolutionary 
standpoint. For example, that by nature humans 
are aggressive, that a particular gene exists 
for aggression and so perhaps the law should 
legally recognise that people with this gene have 
diminished responsibility for their violent crimes. 
In a similarly dark vein, some have argued that 
horrific behaviour such as rape is an evolution­
ary adaptation to spread genetic material and, 
in that sense, is ‘natural’. Few people argue that 
this makes it in any way excusable, but the dis­
turbing implication is left hanging.
I think that these arguments are wrong for 
two reasons. First, very good scientific rea­
sons exist to be sceptical of claims about 
what human genes make people do. Second, 
politically speaking, even if people could dem­
onstrate with certainty what human ‘nature’ 
is, that needn’t bind society’s laws and ethi­
cal decisions. Indeed, many people would say 
that laws and ethics are a way to check and 
control people’s base urges, biases and worst 
natures.
So remain extremely wary of politicians who 
start their arguments with what’s ‘natural’ 
human behaviour.

223
 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
As Charles Darwin realised, not only do you have to be the fittest and strongest 
in order to survive, but also you need to look like the fittest and strongest to 
potential mates. Otherwise, you may survive as an individual, but your genes 
don’t. So male lions have manes, narwhales have tusks and mandrill primates 
have bright blue bums, not because these things help keep their necks warm, 
spear fish or . . . do whatever blue bums help you do. No, these are secondary 
sexual characteristics, present as indirect indicators of strength, virility and 
genetic quality. As another example, bowerbirds decorate their nests with intri­
cate weaving, flowers and shiny beetle cases, not because this makes the nest 
warmer or safer, but because female bowerbirds choose their lovers this way.
In Chapter 14, I point out that some companies spend more on advertising 
than they do on developing better products, and in many ways they’re simply 
taking a lesson from nature: persuading people of your virtues is just as 
important as having those virtues.
)>>
This lesson also applies to humans. In this chapter’s discussion of love, sex 
and marriage, I draw on this evolutionary perspective and the idea of selec­
tion by actual, or perceived, genetic fitness. As with many provocative ideas, I 
suggest that you remain healthily sceptical of some of the claims of evolution­
ary psychology, and actively wary of how they can be applied in discussions 
outside of science. See the nearby sidebar ‘Evolutionary psychology and poli­
tics’ for more info.
Discovering Why You Like 
the People You Like
A remarkable number of conversations, magazine articles, movies and web­
sites revolve around the issue of human attraction: who’s hot and who’s not, 
who do you like and who likes you, and what happens when you really like 
someone who doesn’t (yet) like you back. In this section, I talk about the sci­
ence of human attraction. I discuss evidence behind notions of beauty, the sur­
prising and strange power of averageness and the roles of simplicity, symmetry 
and similarity.
)>>
Take a moment and think about the people that you find attractive. Flick 
through a magazine, perhaps, or scroll through some Facebook profile pic­
tures. Ask yourself the following questions:
)>>
✓)>>Can you discern a pattern to the faces that you find attractive?
)>>
✓)>>Do you appear to go for a type of person? Don’t simply say ‘people who 
are hot’: see whether you can figure out the more difficult question of 
what makes a face attractive.

)>>
✓)>>Do you think that you have a particular taste that’s different from other 
people? Or do you think that everyone pretty much agrees on what 
makes an attractive face?
)>>
You may have begun reading this chapter feeling that you have unusual or 
refined tastes as regards attractiveness. But after thinking about it a little bit 
more, and especially after reading the rest of this section, perhaps you’ll be 
convinced that your judgements are very similar indeed to everyone else’s.
Defining a pretty face
Though we think of beauty as unique and elusive, the scientific evidence is 
that one simple factor determines most of our judgments about attractiveness: 
averageness. In this section I review the evidence for this counter-intuitive 
finding, and discuss some explanations for why it might be so.
)>>
Next time you’re among a large group of people, in a classroom or a crowded 
train, take a look at the faces around you. Assign them points out of ten. (⁜Try 
not to gawp or mouth your scores at people: strangely, people don’t like being 
rated one out of ten!) Imagine that you can ask everyone else present to do 
the same thing and you’d all have a beauty contest. By totalling up the scores, 
you’d find out – objectively speaking – the most attractive person.
But let me tell you a heartening fact: someone in that room is even more 
attractive than your beauty contest winner. That person doesn’t exist physi­
cally, but you can create a picture of him or her: the most beautiful person in 
the room is the mathematical average of everyone present.
This remarkable fact is true of any large group of people. You can take head­
shots of loads of individuals, rank them according to how attractive they 
are and then blend all the faces together to produce an average face. If you 
then ask everyone to look at that average face it’s judged as more attractive 
than any single individual – even though it contains all the unremarkable and 
awkward-looking people who got low scores by themselves.
)>>
As a group, people are always prettier than any individual. Hold on to that 
thought, because it may just be the most positive thing I say in this book.
You may be thinking that averageness doesn’t really cut it on the world’s fash­
ion catwalks. When you look at yet another magazine article ranking the ‘most 
beautiful people in the world’, the word ‘average’ rarely springs to mind. 
Beautiful people are striking and stunning, not average and commonplace. 
Indeed, if you try to chat up people by telling them how ‘wonderfully average’ 
they look, you probably won’t get very far. Unless you want to date a psychol­
ogist, which may be unwise for other reasons.
www.it-ebooks.info

225
 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
)>>
The fact is that what humans appear to hold up as ‘beauty’ doesn’t always 
match what most people find attractive most of the time. If you look through 
magazines over a 100-year spread, and then visit a portrait gallery to go fur­
ther back in time, you find that cultural conceptions of beauty have changed 
and continue to differ between cultures today. Yet, although the face of beauty 
has changed in the fashion and entertainment industry, psychologists have 
found that what most people find attractive has stayed pretty much the same 
over time, and remains the same across cultures.
Preferring averagely pretty faces
Despite cultural norms towards extreme forms of beauty, human beings seem 
to find averageness attractive. This effect has been reliably found across 
many cultures – for example, Inuit people prefer the averaged faces of Welsh 
people and vice versa.
)>>
Researchers suggest many reasons why average faces are judged to be more 
attractive. Here I discuss a couple.
Simplicity
Perhaps simplicity is the key. In general people prefer things – sentences, music, 
ideas – that are easier to process mentally. Average faces, by their nature, don’t 
have any of the idiosyncrasies, complexities and strange lumps that most 
people see in the mirror each morning: they’ve all been averaged out. So some 
researchers think that average faces are more attractive because in this sense 
they’re simpler – or more pure – examples of faces.
Symmetry
Evolutionary psychologists argue that the key to this preference for aver­
ageness is symmetry. By their nature, average faces are more symmetrical, 
because any individual asymmetries are averaged out.

If you have a computer and a camera handy you can make a picture of yourself 
more attractive:

1.)>>Take a picture of yourself head-on.

You now have a perfectly symmetrical full picture. Congratulations, you’ve 
created a more attractive version of yourself.
www.it-ebooks.info

226
Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
In fact, not just the symmetry of your face is important. Evolutionary psy­
chologists have measured the bodily dimensions of large numbers of people, 
right down to the lengths and widths of each finger. Doing so allows them 
to quantify symmetry in terms of how close the measurements are for the 
right and left sides of the body. The claim is that your bodily symmetry ties 
up with how attractive you’re judged to be. Plus, it also correlates with how 
much money you earn, how happy you are and how many sexual partners 
you have. Life is good for symmetrical people.
Why is bodily symmetry so important? Who decided that symmetry was the 
key to attraction, rather than being – what I like to call – elegantly misshapen, 
like me? The short answer is all down to parasites.
To see how, consider being a child growing up before modern medicine: say, 
any time further back than the last 200 years. You’d have had a large number 
of illnesses, infections and parasites during childhood. In fact, the odds are 
that you wouldn’t have survived to adulthood at all. Childhood is a time of 
bodily growth, of course, and this rapid, spurting growth would be hampered 
by any parasites and infections you picked up as you aged. And anytime a 
parasite or infection inhibited a growth spurt in some way, you’d have grown 
asymmetrically, a little bit.
)>>
Your overall body symmetry is like a medical record of your childhood. If you 
want to mate with the healthiest person with the lowest number of bodily 
infections and parasites – and in Darwinian terms, who doesn’t? – you choose 
the person with the most symmetrical body and face. That person provides 
the healthiest match for your genetic material.
Some people think it implausible that people use body symmetry as a cue 
to dating today. Parasites are thankfully rare in many modern societies, and 
many more reliable indicators of health are available if that’s what you care 
about. In addition, are people on first dates actively attending to and keeping 
track of the symmetry between precise bodily dimensions? (Actually, I did 
once meet an evolutionary psychologist who admitted that he had his part­
ner fully measured before he decided to propose to her, but that says more 
about him than proofing the idea.)
But the claim remains that over a long period of time bodily symmetry would 
prove to be a reliable cue to the health of potential partners, and so humans 
evolved a sensitivity to symmetry that survives today.
Choosing a mate
In my lectures on attraction, I present the class with a row of near-identical 
female faces. I ask them to pick the most attractive, or which they think 
would be the most attractive to heterosexual men. Their votes are usually 
spread along the row of faces, but with a strong skew towards the right-hand 
www.it-ebooks.info

227
 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
end. I ask the class to guess how the faces differ, and why people seem to 
prefer the faces more to the right. They make some good guesses – the fore­
head seems a bit bigger towards the right, the chin a little small, the eyes a 
little bigger. All these things are true, but they aren’t how researchers created 
the row of photographs.
The picture on the far left is an unaltered image of a woman in her mid-twenties. 
The next picture on the right is a mix of the original plus 10 per cent of a dif­
ferent face. The next image has 20 per cent of the other face mixed in, the next 
30 per cent and so on, until the final picture on the right that has 50 per cent 
of the original woman and 50 per cent of the other face. Something about the 
increasing presence of the other face makes the woman more and more attrac­
tive to people. Somewhat disconcertingly, it’s the face of a 10-year-old girl.
)>>
The more that an adult female has the facial characteristics of a pre-pubescent 
girl, the more attractive she becomes to others. The technical name for this is 
neoteny, and in this context it means that the characteristics of the infant are 
retained by the adult. A neotenous face is one with big eyes, big forehead and 
a tiny chin, nose and mouth: basically the face of every Disney character. Once 
more, this effect can be seen across all cultures. And a good reason exists why 
cartoon characters and toys are drawn in this particular way: it just looks 
damn cute. Interestingly, the facial characteristics of infant faces are seen in 
many mammals, which is why few things on this earth are cuter than a baby 
kitten, panda or hedgehog.
Just to be clear: I’m not saying that human nature is to be attracted to pre-
pubescent girls and baby pandas. The experimental evidence is that what’s 
attractive, to heterosexual men in particular, is a female who’s a sexually 
mature adult but who’s retained some characteristics of a pre-pubescent 
face. Indeed, some famously attractive women – Brigitte Bardot and Kate 
Moss, for example – are known for their childlike faces.
It’s reproduction, stupid!
Evolutionary psychology offers a suggestion as to why heterosexual men are 
attracted to adult females but want them to look pre-pubescent. It’s based on 
the claim that through most of human history, younger females tended to be 
more fertile and have healthier babies. The argument is that the longer you 
live, the more likely you are to have had diseases and the pesky parasites I 
describe in the earlier section ‘Preferring averagely pretty faces’. Plus, some 
evidence (though it’s not clear how strong) exists that egg quality deterio­
rates with age and birth complications increase.
Although not necessarily true or significant factors with modern medicine, 
for most of human history men wanted the healthiest home for their genetic 
material and so sought out females who were as young as possible, while just 
old enough to have children. The claim is that men have evolved to be most 
attracted to sexually mature women who’re young enough to still have the 
facial characteristics of girls.

Although finding direct evidence for this hypothesis is hard, in many cultures 
now and throughout history marriages took place when the female was aged 
12 to 14, around the cusp of puberty. Indeed, the very notion of teenage years 
(where you’re sexually mature but don’t marry and aren’t employed as an 
adult) is a thoroughly modern idea of the last hundred years or so. The idea 
would’ve seemed as crazy in the past as marrying a 12-year-old does today. 
But marriage at that age does fit with the claim from evolutionary psychology, 
because supposedly it would guarantee the healthiest offspring across the 
hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution.
Obviously, in today’s culture females face much more pressure than men to 
look young. Women use the vast majority of cosmetic products, and the vast 
majority of cosmetic surgical procedures are performed upon them. Although 
men too sometimes alter their appearance to look and feel younger, they tend 
to do so well past middle age; whereas, remarkably, women can face pressure 
to look younger when they’re only in their twenties.
What women want
If mating men look for youth and fertility, what do women want? By present­
ing women with headshots of lots of men and asking them to rate attraction, 
psychologists have identified some common characteristics. As well as sym­
metry, the facial characteristics in men that are typically attractive to het­
erosexual females are a wide, strong jaw and jutting forehead. These aren’t 
features of the infant, and so another factor must be at work here.
)>>
These features correspond to the levels of testosterone in the male body. This 
hormone is made in the testes and plays a role in sperm production. It makes 
men’s voices deeper, increases their muscle mass and puts hair on their chests. 
It also produces the strong jaws and jutting foreheads that women like and is 
also linked to assertive and aggressive behaviour. (I explain in Chapter 2 that 
when males have their honour insulted, their testosterone levels spike.)
The evolutionary claim is that a woman’s choice of man is influenced by the 
levels of testosterone revealed in his face. Men with higher testosterone are 
more likely to be the dominant alpha males who have more resources and 
more ability to defend them. So, once more, at some level women are playing 
the same evolutionary game of getting the best genetic material to partner 
their genes.
Liking people who are like you
People – thank God – don’t choose friends and partners purely on their looks. 
There are many nuanced and complex answers to the question of what else 
makes two people like each other, but one very simple answer is almost 
entirely true: people like people who are like them.

If you ever use a dating agency, you’re asked a huge number of questions 
about your habits, preferences, beliefs and attitudes. The companies then 
imply that they take your answers and process them with some secret formula 
that mathematically calculates your perfect mate. In fact, the process is much 
simpler than that: they just find someone who answered the most questions 
the same way as you.
The psychological evidence – backed up by the huge success of dating 
agencies – is that humans just like people who are similar to them, in 
every way possible.
Focusing on the People You Love
In the earlier section ‘Discovering Why You Like the People You Like’, I dis­
cuss what makes a face attractive to you and what makes a person likeable. 
In a sense, you can view these judgements as unemotional ones. You spot a 
pretty face on the bus or on an advertising hoarding, or find a character like­
able on a television show, but you don’t really feel anything for that person.
Here I want to examine a quite different experience: being in love with some­
one. You don’t have to find that person attractive – you don’t even have to 
like them particularly – but you can still be in love with them. When you’re 
attracted to someone in this context, you often have more than aesthetic 
judgements on your mind.
In this discussion on sexual orientation, I consider questions such as:
)>>
✓)>>Why do some people spend their lives falling in love with men and some 
falling in love with women?
)>>
✓)>>Why do the majority of people fall in love with people of the opposite sex?
Of course, this area is extremely complicated, very personal and highly politi­
cal. As with many complex issues, people like to make sweeping and simplis­
tic statements about it. You can hear theories of sexual orientation in terms 
of evolution, parental attitudes, cultural norms, specific childhood experi­
ences, sin and bewitchment.
Dealing with all these ideas would result in a book thousands of pages long, 
and so I choose to focus on the important persistence of childhood attach­
ment types in later life, whether a ‘gay gene’ exists and why certain groups of 
people become sexually attractive to specific groups of people.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Developing types of attachment 
in childhood
The bond you feel to your parents is probably the first relationship that can 
be characterised as love. It’s not romantic love, or even directly related to 
liking at times, but it’s certainly a form of love and emotional dependency.
)>>
This bond isn’t a luxury in infancy; it’s a necessity. In experiments with mon­
keys, researchers found that infants raised with all their basic requirements 
met – food, warmth, shelter – but without their mothers’ nurturing behaviour 
had behavioural problems throughout their lives. This result has sadly and 
unintentionally been replicated in human infants who were raised in under­
funded orphanages in Romania in the 1990s.
To investigate the relationship between infants and their caregivers, psychol­
ogists placed infants and caregivers in a test called the ‘strange situation’. 
The caregiver and child played with each other in the room while researchers 
watched. Then a stranger entered the room and joined in. The caregiver then 
left the room, and the infant was alone with the stranger. By observing how 
the infant reacted to the caregiver’s departure and return, researchers cat­
egorised three particular attachment styles:
)>>
✓)>>Secure attachment: Infants with this style happily explore the room in 
the strange situation when the caregiver is present and readily interact 
with the person. They’re upset when left alone with the stranger, but 
happy and relieved when the caregiver returns. When these infants are 
adults, they tend to have trusting relationships, good self-esteem and 
find it easy to be with others.
)>>
✓)>>Avoidant attachment: Infants with this style don’t explore the room very 
much and seem to ignore their caregivers. Their behaviour doesn’t change 
whether the caregiver is present or not. As adults, they find relationships 
difficult and have a hard time getting close to people or trusting them.
)>>
✓)>>Anxious attachment: Infants with this style are wary of the stranger and of 
exploring the room. But when the caregiver leaves the room they become 
very distressed. As adults, they find forming relationships easy, but then 
experience extremes of emotional highs and lows and are often unhappy.
)>>
Remarkably, infants’ behaviour in this test appears to predict how they form 
and maintain relationships for the rest of their adult lives, although these styles 
aren’t set in stone. People who are avoidant as infants and in their early rela­
tionships can become secure with the right partner. But the way in which the 
first love of your caregivers is felt affects you throughout the rest of your life.

 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
Searching for the ‘gay gene’
Many people argue that sexual orientation isn’t ‘something you choose’. They 
then proceed to equate this statement with the belief that sexual orientation 
must be hard-wired into your genes. In the nearby sidebar ‘The politics of 
sexual orientation and choice’, I provide several reasons why you need to be 
wary of this argument.
But some evidence does exist that homosexuality is hereditary, and so for 
a moment I want to consider the argument: Why would a gay gene exist and 
how could it have evolved?
Evolution isn’t necessarily about becoming the fastest, the brightest or the 
best. The winners of the evolutionary game are the organisms that pass on 
their genes to the next generation. So the one thing you need to do if you 
want to pass on your genes is to have sex with another member of your spe­
cies in a way that leads, eventually, to babies. In other words, if you were 
going to hard-wire anything into a creature, it would be the desire and the 
ability to have heterosexual reproductive sex. So why would a gay gene exist?
)>>
One argument put forward by evolutionary psychologists is that perhaps 
having gay male relatives is advantageous for other people (the theories only 
concern themselves with male homosexuality – I don’t know why). Think of 
the argument this way: as a child, having an uncle who doesn’t have children 
may be a good thing.
Several years ago, my brother was a relatively well-off, single dentist, whereas 
I had three small children and not much spare money. At Christmas the 
children had a pile of presents from my wife and me, their friends and other 
relatives. But towering above these was the pile of presents from my brother 
alone. He didn’t have his own children draining his wallet, but because he 
likes his family and likes children, he was incredible generous to my kids. 
The role of formative experiences
Despite such ideas once being widespread, no 
evidence exists whatsoever that a particular, 
single childhood experience can determine 
your sexuality. These notions sometimes had 
their roots in now-debunked Freudian theories 
about psycho-sexual development, repressed 
urges and the formative relationship between 
a mother and child. Sometimes they were 
fuelled by a fear of ‘predatory’ homosexuals 
who’d ‘recruit’ young people into their lifestyle. 
Such fears were one reason that homosexuals 
were often excluded from professions such as 
teaching.
You may still hear such ideas repeated today, 
but no single person – not your mother, your 
father or your scout leader – can determine 
your sexual orientation.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Now imagine my family as ancient cave people (it’s not too hard if you meet 
them). We’re dividing up the slaughtered buffalo among the hunters. I have 
to share my portion with my children. But my brother, having no needy off­
spring of his own, gives my kids some of his leftovers.
With a childless uncle, my children get a share of my resources and of his. One 
way that evolution could achieve this state is a genetic adaptation that has, 
say, a 90 per cent chance of producing a heterosexual male and a 10 per cent 
chance of producing a homosexual male. That way enough straight males lust 
after women to reproduce the gene and enough gay males bring in additional 
resources from the hunt to help the gene carriers to survive. In other words, 
a tribe with a small percentage of gay males may have fewer breeding males, 
but it has better fed and more pampered children than a tribe of only straight 
men, which in the long run brings a survival advantage. That, at least, is one 
evolutionary argument for the adaptive value of a ‘gay gene’.
The politics of sexual orientation and choice
Homosexual activity was criminalised in the UK 
until 1967, and now, only a couple of genera­
tions later, same-sex unions have been given 
full legal recognition. In the past few years, the 
same changes have happened in many other 
countries in Europe and various states in the 
US. In other countries, however, such as Russia 
and Uganda, persecution of homosexuality is 
increasingly violent and severe.
When the issue of homosexual rights is dis­
cussed in families, pubs or angry radio phone-
in shows, you always hear people talking about 
whether or not they think being gay is a choice. 
Usually, people in favour of equal rights for 
same-sex relationships say that who you fall in 
love with isn’t a choice, you’re born that way. 
People against those equal rights or who are 
straightforwardly homophobic say that it’s just 
a lifestyle choice.
Whether you think that you choose your sexual 
orientation or not matters politically and affects 
whether you’re for or against legalising gay 
marriage. I think that for many people the reason 
is that if sexuality is something you’re born with, 
it’s equivalent to ethnicity. Most people agree 
that discriminating against people because of 
the colour of their skin is wrong in principle. 
Therefore, the argument goes, if you’re against 
racism, and you think that sexual orientation 
isn’t a choice, you should also support equal 
rights for same-sex relationships.
I can understand the politics of this argu­
ment, but as a psychologist it makes me very 
uneasy. Psychologists simply don’t divide up 
human behaviour into things that you choose 
and things that you don’t choose. Every action 
you take is a result of influences from the situ­
ation around you, from your past experiences 
and from your genetic inheritance. Scientists 
have the difficult job of untangling these causal 
threads. But your ‘choice’ isn’t part of the pic­
ture: it’s an unscientific word. Psychologists 
want to understand the reasons behind your 
choices.

 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
)>>
But here are a couple of reasons to be sceptical about the ‘good gay uncle’ and 
the ‘gay gene’ argument:
)>>
✓)>>Genes don’t really work like that. Very few examples exist of a single 
gene giving rise to a single trait. Even the textbook example of eye 
colour isn’t produced by a single gene, but by a set of genes. The more 
researchers discovered about genetics, the more they’re discovering 
that what’s vital is the interaction between genes, and between genes and 
the environment. Experiences that you have in your life turn your genes 
on and off – they can change your gene expression – and many, many 
complex causal loops between the organism and their environment 
determine an organism’s development. No single gene exists ‘for’ any­
thing, let alone something as complex and culturally flexible as sexuality.
)>>
✓)>>The evidence is weak. Gay uncles today may well give better Christmas 
presents, or at least researchers could do a study correlating sexual­
ity with the size of Christmas gift receipts. But they can’t do this with 
ancient hominids. Scientists have no direct evidence from the archaeo­
logical record of gay members of the tribe, or that they distributed their 
wealth and resources in a way that favoured their nieces and nephews.
Interacting elements: Exotic 
becomes erotic
Here’s another theory on sexual orientation. Daryl Bem, a social psycholo­
gist, suggests that it’s determined by the interaction of your biology, your 
childhood and your culture.
)>>
His theory is called the exotic becomes erotic (EBE) theory. It’s an interesting 
theory that neatly combines several elements: a genetic component of your 
personality and dispositions, the experiences you have growing up and the 
way that your culture treats males and females. All these are tied together 
with a plausible story that is supported by psychological evidence. The data 
doesn’t yet conclusively support this theory, or any other, for sexual orienta­
tion, but so far it seems a more compelling candidate than the ‘gay gene’ story 
in the preceding section.
I’m sure that the EBE theory doesn’t explain everyone’s childhood experi­
ence and sexual orientation. Human sexuality – and love – is such a complex, 
nuanced and culturally determined thing that it would be very surprising if 
scientists ever have a completely satisfying theory. But it does combine the 
biological, psychological and cultural factors, which any successful theory 
surely must.
Here’s a walk through the four elements of the EBE theory.
www.it-ebooks.info

234
Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Inherited preferences
The first element that eventually determines your sexual orientation is your 
genetic predisposition to enjoy certain types of activity.
As a child, you liked certain activities and not others: perhaps you enjoyed 
running around kicking footballs, play-fighting with swords and riding bikes; 
or doing puzzles, building Lego or constructing elaborate fantasy worlds 
with play figures and stuffed animals. These preferences are an aspect of a 
child’s personality, and the evidence is that these sorts of preferences are 
largely inherited. If your parents are very active and boisterous, you probably 
are too.
Gender polarisation
The second element of the EBE theory is a society that segregates the gen­
ders in their play activities.
Look around any toyshop and you see that some aisles are labelled ‘boys 
toys’ (including guns, weapons, construction kits, skateboards and more 
weapons) and others are labelled ‘girls toys’ (where you’re assaulted by a 
wave of pink, glitter and fur, dolls, pony sets, make-up kits and more dolls). 
Science kits are in the boys’ section; toy kitchens are in the girls’. The con­
trast is remarkable; it’s called gender polarisation.
The chances are that if you’re a little boy, regardless of what you may want to 
play with, you’re given sports equipment, weapons and building toys. You see 
other older boys playing with these items in the school playground and on 
TV adverts, and the adults buying you Christmas presents buy them from the 
boy’s aisle in the shop. Girls may prefer a chemistry set or a bow and arrow, 
but the chances are increased that they get a toy oven or a hairdryer.
)>>
Regardless of their disposition, boys tend to be given toys that emphasise 
physical activity and girls given toys that emphasise social activity.
Now, most children may well be happy with this state of affairs. Little boys do 
have more testosterone and tend to be a little more energetic, for example. 
But the fact is that cultural expectations exaggerate, or polarise, the differ­
ences between the sexes. Boys are kicked outside and given a football, and 
girls are given dolls and make-up.
Intergroup processes
When you add together the first two elements of the EBE theory (a biologi­
cal disposition for a certain type of activity and a society that pushes boys 
towards one type of activity and girls to another), you get a society where 
most boys play only with other boys and most girls play only with other girls. 
That certainly seems to describe most playgrounds you see.
www.it-ebooks.info

235
 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
But a further consequence is that some boys, a minority perhaps, have a 
strong disposition to play make-believe social games with dolls and dressing 
up, and some girls really want to run around and hit things. These children 
are termed gender atypical:
)>>
✓)>>Gender atypical boys grow up spending a lot of time playing with girls, 
because they have the best doll collections.
)>>
✓)>>Gender atypical girls mostly hang out with boys, because they’re the 
ones in the park playing football.
Now the third element of the theory comes into play: intergroup processes. 
If you spend most of your time with members of one sex, and very little time 
with the other, you’re going to form certain stereotyped views and generalisa­
tions about the differences between boys and girls, and form your own social 
identities in those terms. In particular, the people that a child plays with a lot, 
whether boys or girls, become their in-group and the sex of children that they 
don’t play with become the out-group.
)>>
As you see in Chapter 16, people seize upon any reason to draw distinctions 
between ‘them’ and ‘us’. The slightest difference, real or imagined, can be 
used to form social groups, which unfortunately can be quickly followed by 
suspicion, prejudice and fear. For an example of how this can work in the play­
ground, see the nearby sidebar ‘Early lessons in biology: The cootie factor!’.
Misattribution of arousal
The fourth element in the EBE theory appears as nature plays a wild card: 
puberty, a time of bodily change and hormonal upheaval. For the first time, ado­
lescents start to feel the stirrings of sexual desire. During the early, tumultuous 
period of puberty, this desire is like a box of fireworks in a microwave: things 
just go off at random. This final element in the EBE theory is therefore the misat­
tribution of arousal, a process that occurs throughout life, not just in adolescents.
)>>
People are surprisingly bad at interpreting their own physiological states. The 
sensation of your pulse racing and your hands trembling feels exactly the same 
whether you’re scared, excited, elated or anxious. You can’t tell the difference.
Early lessons in biology: The cootie factor!
Children often run round the school playground 
screaming about cooties, or nits as they were 
called when I was young. These imaginary 
organisms inhabit the opposite sex and repre­
sent just how horrible they are. In my school, if 
you were touched by a member of the opposite 
sex during a game of chase, or you accidently 
picked up a pencil belonging to one of them, 
you were expected to run around screaming, 
‘Ewww, I’ve got nits, gross!’.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Bridge over aroused waters
In the classic demonstration of misattribution of 
arousal, male participants had to walk across 
a bridge to talk to an attractive female experi­
menter. The bridge was either low, or very high, 
so that most people would feel some anxiety 
walking over it. After asking the participants 
some questions, the female experimenter gave 
the participants her phone number, in case they 
wanted to call her later to ask about the results 
of the experiment.
The participants who walked across the high 
bridge would have had elevated heart rates, 
sweaty palms and all the physiological signs 
of mild fear. When they talked to the female 
experimenter, however, they tended to misat­
tribute these physiological signs as arousal and 
attraction towards the female experimenter. 
Participants who walked across the high bridge 
were more likely to call her later and ask her out 
on a date.
When you experience the emotion of fear or excitement you’re interpreting your 
bodily signal in terms of what’s happening around you. If you’re watching the 
last five minutes of a cup final match and your team is holding on for the win, 
your pulse may be racing and you feel excitement. You interpret the exact same 
physiological state as fear when, later that day, you get stuck in a pub with 
drunken fans from the losing team, and you’re wearing the wrong scarf (gulp).
The process of misattribution of arousal explains why, for example, people 
often go out to see horror movies or go on rollercoaster rides together. If you 
can mildly scare your date, he or she may well mistake that fear for feelings 
of attraction towards you.
Combining the four elements together: The exotic become erotic
According to their biological dispositions, and exaggerated by a gender-
polarised society, most young boys play with other boys and most young 
girls play with other girls. Psychological group processes mean that, in 
general, the two sexes look upon each other as hostile out-groups.
Then puberty arrives and in a process of misattribution, the fear that comes 
from contact with the opposite sex gets confused and connected with the 
desire of puberty. In the crucible of adolescent hormones, people are sexually 
attracted to the sex that they didn’t spend time with as children: the unfamil­
iar, the exotic, becomes erotic.
Therefore, most boys are attracted to the enigmatic creatures that are girls 
and most girls are attracted to the mysterious and unfamiliar things that 
are boys. So the EBE is a theory about the causes of heterosexuality. But 
it’s equally a theory about homosexuality, because children with strongly 
www.it-ebooks.info

237
 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
gender atypical dispositions spend most of their childhoods playing with the 
opposite sex. As a result boys who are familiar with girls become attracted 
to other boys during adolescence and girls who spent most of their time run­
ning around with other boys find other girls at first scary and then attractive.
Analysing the EBE’s consequences
)>>
The EBE theory has the advantage that it doesn’t treat sexuality as a straight­
forward gay or straight issue. People can be attracted to the same or the 
opposite sex in different degrees, in a way that can be predicted by their child­
hood predispositions and experiences. This more graded sense of sexuality is 
a better fit for many people’s experiences, and the different and various ways 
that sexuality has been viewed in different cultures and at different points in 
history.
The EBE also makes a number of testable predictions. The most obvious 
one is that adults who were gender atypical as children are more likely to 
be homosexual. After all, psychologists can just ask people to find out, can’t 
they? But despite appearing to be a straightforward prediction, obtaining 
reliable data isn’t easy. Memory is highly unreliable, and childhood memory 
more so. Autobiographical memory is a story that people write and re-write 
to make sense of themselves, and a healthy dose of hindsight bias is always 
at work too, selecting the childhood memories that demonstrate what later 
seems obvious. But with these caveats in mind, homosexual men and women 
are more likely to have been gender atypical as children. Not all, but certainly 
more than average.
One consequence of the EBE theory is that sexual orientation is, in part, an 
outcome of gender polarisation. Significantly, gender polarisation acts dif­
ferently on boys and girls. As you may have observed, things are generally 
worse for a boy who likes girls’ toys than a girl who likes boys’ toys. The girl 
may be called a tom-boy in the playground and the boy much worse. As a 
result, the pressures to be gender typical are arguably greater for young boys 
than young girls, and so boys tend to be more gender polarised than girls.
Therefore, the EBE theory would predict that sexual orientation should be 
more fixed in men and more fluid in women: because boys are more likely 
to have played with all boys growing up (or all girls) they should either be 
strongly straight or strongly gay; because girls, on the other hand, experience 
less pressure to play with one gender or another, they should have a more 
graded sexual orientation as adults.
As Lisa Diamond and other researchers have shown, this does seem to be 
the case. Women tend to have a more fluid sexual orientation, and are more 
likely to have partners from one sex at one time and from the other sex at 
a different stage in life, compared to men; though whether this difference is 
explained by the EBE or some other factor is still debated.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Successful long-term relationships
The EBE theory seems to throw up a paradox. If 
people are sexually attracted to those who are 
unfamiliar and different, how come they tend 
to like people who are similar to them (see the 
earlier section ‘Liking people who are like you’). 
Are the people you like and the people you lust 
after completely opposite people? In fact, this 
isn’t really a paradox, simply the tragic state of 
human existence and the plot of almost every 
song, novel and film.
So should you be guided by liking or lust? More 
specifically, whom do you form successful long-
term relationships with? Well, I’m not in the busi­
ness of giving relationship advice – this book isn’t 
Marriage Guidance For Dummies – but the evi­
dence suggests that although you can fall in love 
very heavily with people who’re different from 
you, and you may have wonderful, intense rela­
tionships, the ones that are happy, the marriages 
that last, tend to be based on similarity and liking.
Another consequence of the EBE theory makes it quite a good evolutionary 
story too. In Darwinian terms, having a bias towards being sexually attracted 
to people who were unfamiliar as children is very healthy:
)>>
✓)>>It encourages people towards seeking out partners from different tribes, 
villages and cities. (A population with a diverse mixture of genes is much 
healthier and able to adapt.)
)>>
✓)>>It nudges people away from being attracted to members of their own 
family, because they’d be very familiar in childhood. (Over generations, 
cousins becoming husbands and wives can rapidly lead to all sorts of 
genetic disorders.)
So aside from issues about sexual orientation, the EBE acts to increase the 
genetic health of a population.
)>>
Although society has a cultural stereotype about marrying your childhood 
sweetheart, it’s actually quite rare, as the EBE predicts. Researchers looked at 
the experiences of around 3,000 children raised in kibbutzim (collective com­
munities) in Israel. At one time, the common cultural practice in Israeli kibbut­
zim was for all the children to be raised communally. In essence, the children 
of lots of different families on a kibbutz grew up like one very big extended 
family. Researchers tracked down a large group of these children and asked 
them as adults how many had ended up getting married to people from the 
same kibbutz. Out of those 3,000 children, the answer was zero. Just statisti­
cally speaking, that’s very surprising, and suggests that something about that 
shared childhood lowered the attraction that they felt towards each other.

Living with Others: Reciprocal Altruism
Unless you work in the entertainment industry and have just won a major 
award, the chances are that you do not absolutely love everyone you’ve ever 
worked with. In fact, you may not particularly like your boss or your work­
mates. But the fact is that – by and large – people get along with each other. 
You wouldn’t know it from watching the news each evening, but in general 
humans live together in remarkable peace and harmony.
You may occasionally feel like killing your noisy neighbours, the driver who 
cuts you off at the junction or the person loudly eating a stinky boiled egg 
next to you on the train, but these thoughts rarely translate into fatal action.
)>>
Only about 1 per cent of all deaths are at the hands of another person, includ­
ing all the deaths from war. Car accidents kill twice as many people as people 
do. In fact, if you are killed by someone, suicide by your own hand is about 50 
per cent more likely than homicide at someone else’s. The most dangerous 
person you meet is the one looking back at you in the mirror.
People manage to live in harmony with such a large number of people who 
aren’t family, friends or lovers because they learnt to co-operate and help 
each other. If you’re sceptical, see the nearby sidebar ‘The only certainties 
are death, taxes and the need for co-operation’.
Co-operating with each other
In this discussion on co-operation, I turn again to Darwin. Your goal in life as 
an evolved human is to reproduce your genes and maximise their chance of 
survival. So you pick the best mate and share your food and resources with 
your family, your kin, to the degree that they’re carrying your genes.
But why do you share any of your food with people who aren’t directly 
related to you? Evolutionary biologists, such as Robert Trivers, realised that 
under certain circumstances, altruism is advantageous to individuals.
Imagine that you’re a lucky cave-dweller and you have more mammoth meat 
than you can eat. I live in the cave next door and have none. Sharing your 
food with me today makes sense, because tomorrow you may get unlucky in 
the hunt. If you share food with me now, in the future I’ll share my food with 
you. This is termed reciprocal altruism: you’re generous and co-operative 
with your neighbours on the understanding that they’ll be generous and co-
operative with you.

The only certainties are death, taxes 
and the need for co-operation
Today, in most western democracies, about a 
third of the average worker’s income goes to the 
government so that (in theory) it can be spent 
to everyone’s advantage. In some countries it’s 
as much as a half. Even in the US, where many 
people are suspicious of taxation, a quarter of 
everyone’s income, on average, still goes to the 
government. And though they may complain 
about it, and dodge the tax where possible, in 
almost every country richer people pay a higher 
share of their income to tax.
Governments and taxes are a remarkable feat 
of social co-operation. As well as paying tax 
people (mostly) don’t steal from each other, do 
respect each other’s property and even hold 
the door open for strangers. All these actions 
are non-selfish, despite Darwinian reasoning 
seeming to suggest that people’s only concerns 
should be their relatives and themselves.
)>>
Reciprocal altruism is a successful strategy, in theory and in practice. Computer 
models of social groups show that social groups with members that co-operate 
with each other are more successful in the long term than those that compete. 
As I discuss in Chapter 14, every culture in the world has a social norm of reci­
procity. If someone gives you something or does you a favour, the basic human 
urge is to give something back. For instance, reciprocal altruism is the basis of 
the welfare state: people pay their taxes to support the elderly, the ill and those 
who’ve fallen on hard times, knowing that in the future they’ll be supported if 
need be.
Catching the cheaters
But a weak spot exists in the strategy of reciprocal altruism: certain people 
take advantage and cheat.
Say you work in an office with a tin where you put 50 pence every week. 
Someone takes that money and buys milk and coffee cheaply in bulk to stock 
the kitchen area. So instead of having an expensive vending machine, every­
one gets cheap coffee, even when they don’t have change on them. This 
arrangement is a great example of reciprocal altruism because everyone ben­
efits. Except . . . one person in the office benefits more than anyone else: the 
person who sneakily avoids putting in 50 pence every week gets free coffee.
Therefore, although co-operation is undoubtedly advantageous for a society, for 
any one individual in that society it seems to be better to be non-co-operative: 
to lie, steal and cheat. How did individuals evolve the trait of reciprocal altru­
ism, when it’s to their own advantage to be selfish?

Imagine four cards on the table in front of you. Each card has a letter on one 
side and a number on the other. Since they are on the table, you can only see 
one side of them. There is an E, C, 5 and 4. Now I tell you that if a card has a 
vowel on one side then it has an odd number on the other side. What cards do 
you turn over to see whether I’m telling the truth or lying to you? Write down 
your answer when you’ve figured it out.
Now try this second problem. You’re a bouncer at a nightclub. Your boss 
has told you to check for underage drinkers: people drinking alcohol must 
be over 18. You can ask people to prove their age, and you can check their 
drinks for alcohol. Right now, you can see four people in the bar at different 
tables. One person’s drinking beer and the other’s drinking coke. You recog­
nise two other people, but you can’t see what they’re drinking. One of them is 
25 years old and the other is 16. To make sure that no one is drinking under­
age, which tables do you need to investigate? Write your answer down again.
The answer to the first problem is E and 4. If you put down E and 5, you made 
the same mistake as many other people. The fact is that it doesn’t matter 
what’s on the other side of the 5 card. If it’s a vowel, the rule works. If it’s 
not a vowel, the rule doesn’t apply, and so it still holds. But you do need to 
know what’s on the other side of the 4 card, because if it’s a vowel, the rule is 
broken.
The answer to the second problem is that you should check the age of the 
person drinking beer, and the drink of the person who is 16. But, I bet you’d 
figured that out already.
The real puzzle here is why was one problem harder than the other? Those 
two problems have an identical logical structure: you can swap the words 
‘drinking alcohol’ with ‘vowel’ and ‘over 18’ with ‘odd number’ and the prob­
lems are identical. If you can figure out the logic of one problem, you should 
be able to figure out the logic of the other, just as if you can calculate five 
plus seven you can calculate seven plus five. Why is the first problem so 
much more difficult?
)>>
The evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby offer one 
solution to this puzzle. They argue that people have evolved specialised 
brain mechanisms to detect when people are cheating. They claim that the 
second problem of underage drinkers is easier to solve because it’s framed 
as an example of cheating. A social rule is violated and people are experts at 
detecting that. Just as they’ve evolved to be very sensitive to smells that indi­
cate food has gone bad, humans have evolved a nose to sniff out the cheat­
ers among them. This evolved adaptation to detect cheating (and punish it) 
allows reciprocal altruism to thrive as a successful social strategy, because 
people can be confident that everyone is sharing as they should be.
This explanation aligns with everyday experience. How do you feel when some­
one cuts in line ahead of you at an airport queue? Or they cut you off at a road 
junction? The anger that you feel when a social rule is violated is often out of

all proportion to the offence committed. Even though it adds only moments to 
your shopping trip, you fume for hours about someone who clearly had more 
than ten items in front of you in the supermarket express line.
Clearly people care about following social rules, and even more about people 
who violate them. But is there really strong evidence that humans evolved a 
trait specifically to detect cheaters? Many researchers look at the example of 
the two logical puzzles and point to all the other differences between them. 
As well as one being about cheating, the second problem is a scenario you 
may have experienced before (as a bouncer or a drinker). So perhaps it’s 
easier to imagine and reason through, compared to the purely logical puzzle 
about numbers and vowels.
‘I Know my Place’: Power and 
Social Status
Interpersonal interaction involves a lot more than liking, loving and co-operating. 
Human societies are hierarchical: they have kings, CEOs and bosses, serfs, data-
entry clerks and interns. The signs of social class are pervasive. In medieval 
times, your birth decided your profession, your wage and the sorts of clothes 
you could wear and the length of the toes on your shoes. Even today, in more 
egalitarian times, cues to social class are everywhere. Look around an airport 
and I bet you can guess the social class of most people and predict who’ll end 
up being pampered in the first-class cabin, with the clean loos no one else is 
allowed to use!
Social status shapes many other aspects of your behaviour:
)>>
✓)>>The amount of eye contact you have with someone depends on their 
status. Depending on your culture and this situation, it will be more or 
less that low-status people.
)>>
✓)>>In a group discussion, people spend more time looking at the face of the 
high-status person.
)>>
✓)>>The degree to which someone can keep speaking or be talked over is 
determined by their perceived status.
)>>
✓)>>You can even detect differences between body language and posture 
between the powerful and the lowly: high-status people tend to have 
more open and expansive postures. If you peek into a meeting room and 
see one person with their hands behind their head or feet on the desk, 
the chances are they are the boss (or think that they should be).

 Chapter 15: Interpersonal Relations
)>>
If you believe that the strong influence of social hierarchies on behaviour is 
peculiar to people, think again: it seems to have evolved before creatures even 
evolved into humans. If you go to the zoo, for example, you may not know 
who’s the most attractive or the cleverest chimpanzee in the enclosure, but 
after a few moments’ observation of behaviour and body language, it becomes 
obvious who’s the dominant male of the group. Careful experiments with 
chimps and monkeys show that they respond differently to photographs of 
other members of their group, depending on their social status.
People use social status to shape groups and activities. In studies of juries, 
for example, researchers find that the role of foreman nearly always goes to 
the person with the highest perceived social status. These cues generally fall 
into one of types:
)>>
✓)>>Specific status characteristics related to the task at hand: For example, 
an ex-policeman may have legal expertise that would raise his status in a 
jury setting.
)>>
✓)>>Diffuse status characteristics: Such as age, educational level or occupa­
tional status.
People don’t respond only to the perceived power and social status of other 
people; the social status that they ascribe to themselves changes their behav­
iour too. Researchers can make you feel more or less power and social status 
by making you engage in simple exercises. For example, they can ask you to 
write about a time that you were sacked from a job; or a time that you made 
a decision to sack someone else. After recalling these moments, the research­
ers gave participants simple tasks, such as finding an L on a screen among 
a splatter of Ts, or deciding what to do over the weekend depending on the 
weather.
)>>
They found that people who were made to feel low social power were faster at 
finding the L among the Ts. People who felt high social power were less likely 
to change their weekend plans according to the weather. If they wanted to go 
for a walk they would, even if it was going to rain.
Getting tongue-thai’ed
In Thai society, social status information is 
needed to figure out someone’s class before 
you decide which of 14 different pronouns to 
use when addressing someone. A different 
word is used for ‘you’ when talking to your child, 
a younger person, a peer, a book and other 
ranks up to the king. And you thought English 
was complex!

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Apparently, when people are feeling of low social power they attend more to 
the things going on around them. They have a broader attentional window, 
so to speak. For this reason, they’re faster at visual tasks where they have to 
search for things or integrate many different sources of information at once. 
In contrast, high-power people are less focused on the world around them 
and more focused on their own goals, motivations and beliefs. So they decide 
what to do over the weekend based on their desires, and are less swayed by 
contextual information, such as the weather or what other people want.
As a consequence, people who feel high social power are also more likely to 
make stereotypical judgements about people. Instead of looking through the 
CV of a job applicant and considering their strengths, for example, they’re 
more likely to reject a female for an engineering position because it doesn’t 
accord with their pre-existing stereotypes.
To make sense of these findings, I turn to Donald Trump: a man of high social 
power, in his own mind at least. If you’re Donald Trump’s personal assistant, 
you’re in a position of low power. Your job is to check every detail – that 
the limo has the right bottle of water, that Donald is on time for his appoint­
ments, that the wigs have been ironed and so on. So having a wide attentional 
focus is useful. But if you’re Donald himself, you don’t need to attend to 
what’s going on around you as much; that’s someone else’s job. You have the 
power and the resources so that you can attend to your own goals and moti­
vations. You’re free to act upon them, rather than the demands that the world 
puts upon you.
What’s remarkable is that these different ways of relating to the world aren’t 
just the result of a lifetime of being a CEO or a personal assistant. The same 
mode of thinking can be activated in you just by a short exercise that makes 
you feel more or less powerful. So although ending a chapter on love, beauty 
and desire with the image of Donald Trump is a real shame, he does serve as 
an illustration of the psychological forces that shape social interaction.

Examining the Benefits and 
Dangers of Social Groups 
In This Chapter
▶)>>Categorising people
▶)>>Thinking about group thinking
▶)>>Pulling together as a group
P

eople have an astonishing number of ways of dividing themselves into 
groups: countries, races, star signs, religions, occupations and so on. 
Rightly or wrongly, social groups structure how humans think about each 
other. They’re the bias for one of the most important distinctions in people’s 
personal and social lives: the difference between ‘them’ and ‘us’.
Forming and maintaining group relationships can have profound conse­
quences for how you view other people, and especially how you view your­
self. At work, school and in society generally, whether you’re part of the 
popular majority in-group, the minority out-group or a stigmatised group 
affects your self-esteem, health and world view. In this chapter I examine how 
you categorise other people, how you place yourself into a group and how 
such impulses can cause group conflict. I also look at groups in action, exam­
ining how people share their opinions and make decisions together.
Introducing the Desire to Separate 
People into Groups
People love to categorise themselves and others: by the football teams they 
support, the political parties they vote for and even the cars they drive. For 
example, you can probably identify what you think a country music fan looks

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
like, how an iPhone user differs from an Android user and what party a veg­
etarian is likely to vote for. Whether or not you’re correct in all these assump­
tions isn’t the point: the fact is that people are driven to categorise people 
into social groups
)>>
One striking example is how people see differences between themselves and 
their near neighbours. I spent one summer in Sweden and Denmark. The 
Swedes related hilarious stories about those crazy Danes with their schnapps, 
weird rotten fish delicacies and odd customs; and the Danes told equally 
funny stories about the crazy Swedes with their (slightly different) schnapps, 
slightly different rotten fish delicacies and equally inscrutable (to outsiders) 
customs.
These differences are hugely salient to the Swedes and the Danes and form an 
important part of their identity. Although I’ll deeply annoy my Scandinavian 
friends by saying so, to an outsider Swedes and Danes are virtually indistin­
guishable. You can say the same, of course, about the English and the Welsh, 
Australians and New Zealanders, and Canadians and Americans.
In this section I describe the apparently irresistible urge of humans to cat­
egorise each other and treat others differently depending on if they are in 
the same or a different social group as themselves. I also discuss the benefits 
people gain from joining a group.
Categorising people just for the sake of it
In this section I look at some of the reasons that people distinguish one group 
of people from another. Even though those reasons can be very slight, even 
imaginary, such social groups can have considerable psychological conse­
quences for their members.
)>>
Are you left- or right-handed? You may think that the question is only relevant 
when you’re using a pair of scissors or playing tennis. But scientists have 
found that systematic psychological differences exist between people who are 
left- and right-handed. Before I tell you what those group differences are, test 
your own social knowledge of these groups and their differences as follows: 
spend a couple of minutes thinking about all the right- and left-handed people 
you know. Write down two lists of personality traits that you think are shown 
more strongly, on average, in right- and in left-handers.
www.it-ebooks.info

247
 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
When your two lists are finished, look down them and put a tick for every 
word that’s (broadly speaking) a positive thing and a cross for words that are 
negative things. For example, being creative is positive and being argumenta­
tive is negative. Now count up the number of ticks and crosses you have for 
left- and right-handers.
)>>
Before you analyse your results, here’s one important thing: scientists have 
found no personality differences at all between right- and left-handed people! 
Sorry, I lied to you. As psychologists such as Chris McManus have concluded, 
very large surveys have measured people’s personalities, intelligence and 
health, and discovered no differences whatsoever. It’s a common misconcep­
tion that there are such things as ‘left-brained’ and ‘right-brained’ people. Or 
rather, there are different types of people, and some are more analytic and 
some more creative, but this has little to do with handedness and simple right- 
and left-sided differences in brain activity.
The fact is that for various reasons people have cultural beliefs about left-
handed people. Whereas a ‘right-hand man’ is someone to trust, for example, 
the word ‘sinister’ derives from the Latin for ‘left hand’. Plus, certain weak 
pieces of scientific evidence in the past claimed differences and a few of 
these settled in people’s minds as facts. But the strongest evidence so far is 
for no differences whatsoever.
Now look back to your two lists. Did you put more negative descriptions for 
left-handers or for right-handers? Did you put more positive descriptions for 
the group to which you yourself belong? Why do you think these differences 
exist in your mind, when they don’t exist in reality between right- and left-
handed people?
Students studying each other
Where I went to university as an undergraduate, 
in Oxford, the students were divided up in 30 dif­
ferent colleges, where they slept, ate and some­
times studied. By the end of my three years, I 
thought I was able to tell you exactly what the 
people were like in at least 20 of those colleges, 
identifying the most arrogant, the most nerdy, the 
most artistic ones and those who just wanted to 
party. All a friend had to say was, ‘I’m dating 
this girl, but she’s from Wadham College, so you 
know. . . ’ and I knew exactly what he meant.
On mature reflection, and having wandered 
around Oxford since, I realise that these beliefs 
are complete nonsense. Or at least, that the 
similarities between the students (a bit preten­
tious, insecure, middle class) far outweigh the 
differences between them.

One feature of human psychology is that if a way exists to divide people up 
into groups, they start instantly to perceive differences between those groups. 
Even when based on superficial and unimportant characteristics, people imag­
ine that the groups reflect deeper differences. Check out the nearby sidebar 
‘Students studying each other’ for an example.
Favouring people in your group
Despite the powerful tendency of humans to divide people into groups, and 
for this division to create the illusion of large differences between groups of 
people, you may well argue that real differences do exist between people. 
The average country fan, for example, may have a different age and political 
outlook to other people in general. But with cunning experiments, research­
ers can prove that people see differences between others and treat them 
differently on the basis of groups, even when no objective differences exist 
between those people.
)>>
These experiments revolve around the idea of the minimal group paradigm, 
which is an experimental method social psychologists use to study the 
effects of social groups. The trouble is that people have many pre-existing 
beliefs (that are not necessarily true) about social groups such as men versus 
women, or right-handers and left-handers. The minimal group paradigm 
allows psychologists to create new social groups and study the effect of 
grouping alone, apart from the effects of social stereotypes (that I discuss in 
Chapter 10).
In minimal group experiments, psychologists give participants fake reasons for 
being in one social group or another, such as telling them that a personality test 
has determined that they are a ‘type X’ person or a ‘type Y’ person. They aren’t 
told anything else about what that means, and in fact, the groups are allocated 
purely at random. In this sense they are ‘minimal’ groups, because the partici­
pants should have no beliefs about what makes them one type or another, or 
any pre-existing stereotypes about the different types. All they know is that 
they are in one group, and other people are in the same or a different group. 
Remarkably, this grouping alone is enough to change their behaviour.
In the early minimal group paradigm experiments, Henri Tajfel and colleagues 
placed participants into two different groups. Participants were told that 
their preferences for paintings by Klee or Kandinsky determined which group 
they were in. But in fact, they were placed in groups completely at random. 
The participants were then given small amounts of money and asked to share 
it among two people: one in the Klee group and one in the Kandinsky. They 
didn’t know who the people were, because they were referred to by a code 
number. All they knew was the group membership.
www.it-ebooks.info

249
 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
The researchers found that participants systematically favoured people from 
their own groups. If they were in the Klee group, participants chose to give 
more money to other people if they were also in the Klee group.
)>>
This behaviour is called in-group favouritism, because people act positively to 
those in the same social group as them, and negatively towards those in 
out-groups.
Perhaps you think that they were doing so for a tangible reason: if they 
happen to have strong views on art, for example, they may think that people 
who prefer Kandinsky are insufferably dull. So in later experiments, the 
researchers removed even those cues. Participants were simply told that 
they were in the X group or the Y group, and given no other reason. These 
groups truly were ‘minimal’. But even then participants displayed a tendency 
to reward people in their own group, despite no difference existing between 
people other than their entirely arbitrary group membership.
Researchers had known that this phenomenon happens all the time in the 
real world. For example, if you find out that someone is from the same town 
as you, or supports the same sports team, you tend to be positively disposed 
towards them. But what’s remarkable in this experiment is that you don’t 
need to share a background or knowledge and love of the same football team: 
simply being told that you’re in the same arbitrary group by an experimenter 
is enough to produce in-group favouritism.
The smallest sense of ‘them’ and ‘us’ is enough to produce favouritism and 
discrimination.
Safety in numbers: Motivational approach
Why do people feel a need to belong to groups and to treat their fellow group 
members differently to others? Beginning with the results from the mini­
mal group paradigm in the preceding section, Henri Tajfel and John Turner 
formed their social identity theory. Their ideas have been developed by 
themselves and others over the years.
)>>
The central notion of social identity theory is that people seek out, commit 
themselves to and categorise themselves into groups because they get 
something back in return: a social identity. It’s also called the motivational 
approach to understanding groups, because it asks why people form and 
maintain groups. (The theory complements the cognitive approach of under­
standing groups in terms of stereotypes and judgement biases that I discuss 
in Chapter 10 and the economic approach that I describe in the later section 
‘Examining the Economic Approach to Group Behaviour’.)

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
A social identity – membership of a group – tells you how to behave, what to 
think and what’s of value. It gives a structure to your identity, and through 
that, a way to achieve self-esteem.
Say that you decide to be ‘born again’ as a fundamentalist Christian. Being 
a member of that group gives you a way to live your life (usefully, it even 
comes in book form), a smart preppy way to dress, forms of politeness, a 
clear social hierarchy and a group of people who give you positive encour­
agement and validation if you act like them. In the same way, if you want to 
be a Satanist Goth, you also find a set of norms, a style of black dress and eye 
make-up, a way of speaking and acting, and a group of people who validate 
you. In a social psychological sense, the reason for joining these groups – sin­
cere religious faith, or a passing music fad – doesn’t matter. Simply the fact 
that you belong to an in-group brings with it a host of psychological effects.
‘I’m in with the in-crowd’: In-groups
Social identity is a route to self-esteem. The achievements and successes 
of your group are bound to your own sense of worth – which is one reason 
for in-group favouritism. If you’re in group X, giving more money to other X 
people is advantageous to you. You may not directly benefit from this strat­
egy in terms of a cash reward, but if Xs as a group get richer, and you’re a 
member of that group, in a way you become richer too. Your membership of 
a group buys you a stake in that success, so to speak. The group’s successes 
become your own. Sure enough, when people carry out acts of in-group 
favouritism, their own self-esteem has been found to increase.
The link between an individual and their social groups can be fluid and 
opportunistic. To put that another way, social identity theory suggests that 
you emphasise your membership of a group when it provides the biggest 
boost to your self-esteem. Researchers examined the behaviour of students 
after their college team won or lost a game. After a win, students were more 
obvious in their group affiliation: the next day more students pulled on the 
team shirt. This was termed ‘basking in reflected glory’.
The effect is subtler than simply wearing the team colours, however. When 
the researchers asked students to describe what happened in the game, their 
language shifted:
)>>
✓)>>After a win, supporters spoke of what ‘we’ did in the game and ‘our 
tactics’.
)>>
✓)>>After a loss, the talk was of ‘their’ mistakes and ‘their’ lack of form.
)>>
People don’t form social groups mindlessly. Social identity theory shows that 
they strengthen their social groups, or distance themselves from them, in rela­
tion to the pay-off to their self-esteem.

 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
‘I’m on the outside (looking in)’: Out-groups
I reveal in Chapter 7 that self-esteem is a relative thing. I feel better about 
myself if I think of the people who dropped out of my college, rather than the 
ones who didn’t and are now millionaires.
Similarly, social identity theory holds that the self-esteem that derives from 
my group membership is relative. I can feel better about myself by contrib­
uting to the success and bolstering the achievements of my own in-group 
or I can denigrate people who are in my out-group. Sadly, the latter option 
is easier, just as effective and just as commonly chosen. In short: prejudice 
makes you feel better about yourself.
Researchers tested this idea by raising or lowering participants’ self-esteem. 
They gave them an intelligence test, but didn’t even bother to grade it. They 
simply told half the participants that they scored very well and half that they 
scored poorly. Then they showed the participants a job interview and asked 
them to rate the candidate. In one condition, they were told that the candi­
date was Jewish. When the (non-Jewish) participants rated the candidate, 
they gave him a harsher score if they themselves had just performed poorly 
on the intelligence test.
At the end of the experiment participants rated their own self-esteem. Those 
who were told that they did badly on the test, who had then judged the Jewish 
candidate poorly, now had high levels of self-esteem. Participants didn’t get the 
same large self-esteem boost if the candidate was non-Jewish, like them.
Unfortunately, the act of denigrating someone from an ethnic out-group has 
the effect of inflating the person’s self-esteem. Indeed, these participants who 
engaged in prejudice felt better about themselves than the ones who were 
told that they’d done very well in the intelligence test. One of the reasons 
that prejudice persists in our society is because of this link between self-
esteem and social groups. Persuading people to avoid being racist or sexist is 
an uphill battle, because denigrating people from an out-group gives people a 
boost in their self-esteem, regardless of the true differences, or lack of differ­
ences, between the achievements and attributes of social groups.
Seeing Groups in Action: Group 
Decision-making
When psychology was in its infancy, a hundred years or so ago, it was fas­
cinated by groups of people. Theorists – Freud even – wrote long essays on 
the ‘mind of the mob’. This was a time of revolution in Europe, remember, 
www.it-ebooks.info

252
Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
and psychologists wondered whether the large groups of people rioting on 
the street, challenging governments, could be thought of as a single entity in 
some way. But, because you can only fit one person on a psychiatrist’s couch 
and one person in a lab cubicle, psychology as a discipline tended to focus 
very much on the individual.
But in this section I reveal how psychologists have studied the choices that 
people make in groups: the ways in which they share and propagate knowl­
edge, opinions and information.
Appreciating the wisdom of the crowds
A liger is the product of a lion, a tiger and a night of – probably awkward – 
romance. Ligers don’t have the best of lives: they have a lot of health prob­
lems, and problems with their hormone regulation mean that they grow to 
enormous sizes. The largest feline in the world was a liger. My question to 
you is: how much do you think that liger weighed?
I’m guessing that – as long as you don’t search the Internet for the answer – 
you don’t know the weight of the world’s heaviest liger. You had to guess, and 
it probably felt like a wild stab in the dark.
)>>
But here’s the remarkable thing. If I were able to collect all the guesses from 
the readers of this book, and averaged those numbers, the average number 
would be very close indeed to the true weight of the world’s heaviest liger 
(408 kilograms, in case you’re still wondering).
Obviously my readers are super-smart, but even so – how can you be indi­
vidually pretty clueless as to the weight distribution of oversized felines, but 
somehow as a group have remarkably accurate knowledge? When I give this 
problem to lecture classes of 100 or more, they typically average between 395 
and 420 kilograms. And invariably this averaged guess is more accurate than 
the guess of any one individual in the group. Well, apart from that one time I 
had a very excited liger fan in the audience.
This effect is known as the wisdom of the crowds. It was first noticed by 
Francis Galton a century ago. At village country fetes, displaying a prize cow 
was popular and villagers held a competition to guess its weight. Galton was 
a statistician and noticed that across many such competitions the average of 
all these estimates would almost always have won the competition over the 
closest guess of an individual.

 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
More recently, the journalist James Surowiecki argued that the wisdom of 
the crowds stretches far beyond the realm of guessing the weight of large 
mammals. Indeed, the US government even had a trial system in which 
large numbers of people sought to guess the likelihood of certain politi­
cal events happening: a revolution in Pakistan, for example. The average of 
these guesses from uninformed people across the country out-performed the 
guesses of well-paid, highly educated expert political analysts.
Discovering how a group of clever people 
can make bad decisions 
Based on the preceding section about the wise crowd, you’d think that when­
ever more than one person makes a decision, they’d draw on this collective 
wisdom. Surely, a group of minds can always do better than an individual. 
Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. The wisdom of the crowd partly 
relies on the fact that all these judgements are independent: people make up 
their own minds. Further research in psychology has found that when people 
interact with each other, the wisdom of the crowd dissolves into the idiocy of 
the committee.
)>>
If people guess the weight of a cow and put it on a slip of paper, or estimate 
the likelihood of a revolution in Pakistan and enter it into a website, the aver­
age of their views is highly accurate. But, surprisingly, if those people talk 
about the issue first the answers that they come to are increasingly incorrect.
More specifically, researchers have found an effect of group polarisation. 
Whatever bias people may have as individuals gets multiplied when they dis­
cuss things as a group. If individuals lean slightly towards taking a risk, a group 
leaps towards it. Say that your friend has to decide whether to leave his job in 
the bank and risk retraining as something new. As an individual, you may say, 
‘Go for it – try a course in sales!’ But if you discuss this in a group, the advice 
may be to leave the job, move to Paris and register for clown school.
)>>
One reason for this polarisation is that, as a group, people can come up with 
a bigger set of persuasive arguments in support of the biased options: because 
everyone favours leaving the job, everyone suggests reasons to do so. But 
they come up with slightly different reasons. One person may point out that 
your friend is unlikely to get promoted any more at the bank, another that a 
new job would mean he’d meet new people, another that he never has the 
chance to travel in his current job and so on. So by the end of the discussion, 
all the group’s talked about is a lot of good reasons in favour of one option. 
As a result, the group agrees on a more extreme conclusion based on this sur­
feit of good reasons.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
The other factor producing group polarisation comes from social comparison 
theory. As I explain in Chapter 8, people tend to think that they’re better 
and more often correct than other people, on average. So when you think 
that your friend should take a moderate degree of risk and leave his job, you 
also think that you give better advice than most people, and so on average 
that you’ll be correctly advising that he take a little bit more risk than most 
people.
But then you hear the opinions of the rest of the group and see that everyone 
is suggesting he takes a little bit of risk. But you saw yourself advising the 
risky option, not the average option. So you recalibrate your advice and say 
something a bit riskier than the last person. And everyone does the same 
thing, and pretty soon people are talking about clown school.
)>>
Both the persuasive-arguments and social-comparison factors can produce 
group polarisation; and both factors are stronger when the group members 
are more similar to each other. This is because you’re more likely to have the 
same initial biases, which in term produce a bigger set of one-sided arguments 
and a bigger social comparison nudge towards extreme views.
This tendency can produce serious consequences. When people who’re simi­
lar to each other meet to discuss an issue, they end that discussion agreeing 
upon a more radical position than they held as individuals before entering 
the room. The polarisation is stronger the more similar the group members 
are to each other.
No doubt you can appreciate that this is a pressing problem in the modern 
world. If you hold a meeting of all the people living on your street, you’re all 
bound to share some similarity. More so than if you struck up a debate at an 
airport, for example. But what if you had a way to reach out to people across 
the world who hold exactly the same values and beliefs as you. And what if 
you discuss issues with those people and only those people who’re highly 
similar to you. You have a way to produce the maximum polarisation of opin­
ion possible. And you’ve invented the Internet chatroom.
Accepting that even experts 
can be stupid in a group
)>>
Experts are, by definition, good at making decisions in their area of expertise. 
Therefore, you’d think that a room full of ten experts would be even better 
at making such decisions. Sadly, for the general public who have to live with 
these decisions, this isn’t always the case.

 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
Irving Janis studied many cases in which governments seem to have all the 
knowledge, expertise and resources at their disposal, but still made cata­
strophically bad decisions. His work focused on disastrous examples of 
group think such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, in which US-sponsored forces 
tried and failed to invade Cuba, to the embarrassment of the US government.
More recent examples also fit the pattern. Al-Qaeda (a group of mostly Saudi 
Arabians based in Afghanistan) carried out the devastating September 11 
terrorist attacks on America, according to experts in the State Department, 
academia, the media and the claims of Al-Qaeda themselves. Yet elements of 
the Bush administration immediately focused on Iraq and Saddam Hussein. 
An advisor to President George W. Bush, Richard Clarke, recounts the follow­
ing the day after the attack:
[The President] came back at me and said, ‘Iraq! Saddam! Find out if there’s 
a connection.’ And in a very intimidating way. I mean that we should come 
back with that answer. . . . We got together all the FBI experts, all the CIA 
experts. We wrote the report. We sent the report out to CIA and found FBI 
and said, ‘Will you sign this report?’ They all cleared the report. And we sent 
it up to the president and it got bounced by the National Security Advisor 
or Deputy. It got bounced and sent back saying, ‘Wrong answer. . . . Do it 
again’.
Richard Clarke, on CBS’s ‘60 Minutes’, March 2004
What this quotation reveals is that in the aftermath of September 11, the 
President and the CIA became fixated on blaming Iraq. They only sought out 
evidence in favour of a link between Iraq and September 11, and actively 
ignored the mounting evidence against such a connection. Indeed, no cred­
ible link between Iraq and September 11 has ever been substantiated. But the 
evidence against a link wasn’t weighed against the evidence for a link: it was 
simply dismissed as ‘the wrong answer’. It was in this climate, a few years 
later, that the UK and US decided to invade Iraq. They did so on the basis 
of arguments that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, when once 
more there was no good evidence whatsoever that they existed. Looking 
at all the facts in hindsight, it seems astonishing that anyone would come 
to the conclusion that Iraq had such weapons. But a group of intelligent, 
professional people were able to argue themselves into just this disastrous 
conclusion.

Decision-makers at the time engaged in what Janis termed group think and the 
US military terms ‘incestuous amplification’. The key idea is that, as individu­
als, people are motivated to make the most accurate decision that they can. 
But that isn’t the only motivation at play when a group of people make a deci­
sion together. Remember that a committee room is a cauldron of social forces.

Imagine that you’re in the war room when your country’s prime minister and 
staff are debating plans for an invasion of another nation. As well as wanting to 
make the right call, you and everyone else are equally motivated by the need 
to conform to the opinion of others and of wanting to obey what your leader 
wants: plus, the fear of embarrassing yourself, displeasing your superiors and 
seeming not to understand something. These forces mean that even if you dis­
agree with what’s being said, you’re understandably reluctant to speak up and 
contradict the prevailing view.
As a result, only evidence in support of the dominant view is brought to the 
table. Disagreement is seen as dissent. Therefore, social forces exclude a fair 
and balanced view, and hasten a wild and unsubstantiated decision.
The dangers of group think have been known since Janis’s work in the 1970s 
and many governments and corporations have explicit strategies to avoid 
it. For example, someone is appointed to give counter-arguments to the 
prevailing view. Discussions are held outside of the main meeting between 
peers rather than in front of superiors. These safeguards have been shown 
to reduce the dangers of group think. But such safeguards often appear to 
go out the window in moments of extreme stress, partisanship and threat. 
Which is exactly when they’re needed the most.
Examining the Economic Approach 
to Group Behaviour
I cover issues of prejudice and group conflict in several places in this book. 
In Chapter 10 I describe the cognitive approach to understanding the root 
causes of such behaviour and in the earlier section in this chapter ‘Safety in 
numbers: Motivational approach’ I define an approach that focuses more on 
the practicalities of living together in society. Here I discuss a third approach.
The fact is that the world contains limited resources and not everyone can 
be rich, well-fed and happy (or at least, no one has yet figured out how to 
achieve this goal). In the face of the resulting competition for resources, the 
economic approach suggests that it makes practical and economic sense for 
individuals to form groups and work together to compete for these resources. 
Anthropologists claim that for much of human evolution, people have lived 
in groups of around 100 to 150 people, co-operating with each other and com­
peting with neighbouring groups for food and resources. The claim is that 
this blend of competition and co-operation is the basis for people’s group 
instincts.

 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
Through a description of one social psychology experiment, in this section I 
look at the role competition plays in creating group behaviour, and whether 
increasing contact and/or manipulating co-operation can heal conflict.
Competing for resources
An experiment by Muzafer Sherif and colleagues illustrates many of the phe­
nomena and social forces that I discuss in this chapter, such as the effects 
of minimal groups, in-group and out-group bias and the dangers of group 
polarisation.
When they performed their experiment in 1954, Sherif and colleagues were 
thinking about society in economic terms and what they called realistic 
group conflict theory, which states that groups arise because there will be 
competition between sets of people for the limited resources in an environ­
ment. Because they were unable to travel back in time to study interactions 
between early hunter-gatherers, they did the next best thing. They studied 
10-year-old boys at a summer camp in a place called Robbers Cove. None of 
the boys knew each other before the camp began. The researchers divided 
them up into two groups of 11 boys at random, and took them to different 
parts of the state park. The two groups of boys engaged in typical camp activ­
ities where they had to co-operate with each other to make meals, pitch tents 
and so on. All the positives of team-building and in-group activity (which I 
discuss earlier in ‘‘I’m in with the in-crowd’: In-groups’) were present. The 
boys seemed to bond well and even chose names for their groups: the Eagles 
and the Rattlers.
In the next stage of the experiment, the Eagles and the Rattlers became aware 
of each other’s existence for the first time when the researchers brought 
them together for a tournament. The victors would receive a medal and a 
penknife. During the five days of competitions, the members of the Eagles 
and the Rattlers clashed with members of the opposing groups. They hurled 
abuse at every opportunity and issued challenges to fights. One morning the 
Rattlers awoke to a pile of ashes where their flag had previously flown, and 
the next day the Eagles flag was stolen. Food fights broke out at lunchtime.
The Eagles and Rattlers displayed every form of out-group hostility at their 
disposal (check out the earlier section ‘‘I’m on the outside (looking in)’: Out-
groups’) as well as being favourable to their in-group.
)>>
The researchers found that competition seemed to turn up the volume on 
all the group processes (quite literally in this case). The boys were more 
positively disposed to members of their own group and more and more 
hostile to the out-group as the tournament went on.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Increasing contact to remove conflict
The researchers conducting the Robbers Cove experiment had guessed that 
producing conflict would be the easy part of the study. The more challenging 
part was to reduce that conflict between the two groups.
Therefore, the next stage of the experiment was an informal test of what’s 
known as contact hypothesis. This notion, formed during the early period of 
the African-American Civil Rights Movement, suggests that perhaps prejudice 
exists in part because members of different groups have no contact with each 
other. In parts of America at the time, Blacks and Whites were segregated and 
had different schools, buses and public toilets. The hypothesis was that if 
these barriers were removed through desegregation, contact would increase 
and negative attitudes towards different groups decrease.
To test this theory, the two groups of boys were brought together after the 
tournament had completed. Yet, even though they were no longer engaged in 
any direct contest or competition for resources, the conflict persisted. The 
insults still flew and members of different groups refused to socialise with 
each other.
)>>
Just as with the experience of desegregation in the South, contact wasn’t quite 
enough to adjust the negative attitudes.
Forcing co-operation to heal divisions
In the final stage of the Robbers Cove experiment, the researchers devi­
ously foisted superordinate goals onto the boys, manipulating events so that 
the two groups had to work together. They created a series of crises that 
required co-operation between all the boys.
In-group favouritism in action
In one game in the Robbers Cove experiment, 
the two groups of boys were given the chal­
lenge of finding as many beans as possible 
hidden in a field. The researchers then tallied 
the numbers and briefly flashed up a boy’s 
name and a picture of the number of beans 
he’d collected. The boys were asked to esti­
mate how many beans he’d collected, because 
the picture was displayed too quickly for them 
to count. The number of beans flashed up was 
always the same, but the Eagles systemati­
cally guessed that a fellow Eagle had collected 
more than a Rattler and the Rattlers guessed 
the reverse. They did so because it boosted 
their self-esteem to be on the winning side by 
a larger margin.

259
 Chapter 16: Examining the Benefits and Dangers of Social Groups 
For example, a lorry carrying supplies broke down. Nearby, the researchers 
had left coiled the boys’ tug-of-war rope. In these days of reality television, 
people are sadly all too used to such acts of manipulation, but in the simpler 
times of the 1950s the boys gamely decided that they’d use this convenient 
rope to tow the lorry. To achieve this goal, they all needed to pull together.
After a few days of such ‘accidental’ co-operation, a remarkable peace 
descended on the camp. When buses arrived to take them home, the boys 
decided to travel together rather than separately, as they’d arrived. In a 
truly inspiring ‘Disney’ moment, when the bus stopped at a café, the Rattlers 
decided that the money they’d won during the tournament should be spent 
on malted milks for both groups.
)>>
Superordinate goals and the need to work together undid the intergroup con­
flict produced by days of competition, more than contact and exposure to 
each other did. (Perhaps a team negotiating between warring factions should 
sabotage their vehicles and insist that enemies work together to get to the 
negotiation venue!)
When members of opposing groups see themselves as working together, prej­
udice and conflict have a chance to dissipate. Unfortunately, I suspect that 
manipulating superordinate goals in a summer camp for boys would prove to 
be a tad easier that orchestrating events to fix intergroup conflict in the real 
world.
The problem is that resources aren’t necessarily equally distributed among 
the sexes, regions of a country, religious factions, ethnic groups and so on. 
And as I state earlier in ‘Safety in numbers: Motivational approach’, in-group 
members can boost their self-esteem by denigrating out-group members. 
When a short-term gain is to be achieved by portraying other groups as self­
ish or undeserving, finding a superordinate goal that everyone sees them­
selves as working towards equally is extremely difficult. Sadly, therefore, the 
motivational need of the individual throws a spanner in the works of the eco­
nomic fix for intergroup conflict.

L

ook up the word ‘human’ on Wikipedia and on the right of the entry you 
see a picture of two human beings. The choice of that picture generated 
one of the longest debates between contributors and editors in Wikipedia’s 
history. Obviously, one picture of two people can’t represent the whole 
of humanity, but since only one can be chosen, what would be the best 
approximation?
People come in a huge variety of sizes, shapes and skin colours and have all 
sorts of jobs. But like the majority of humans, the Wikipedia picture is of a 
man and woman who live in Southeast Asia, have brownish skin and, like the 
majority of humans in human history, are farmers. What you can’t see in that 
photograph, of course, is how these people think, feel and interact with each 
other, which raises the important question: How different are people across 
the world in their social thoughts and habits?
In this chapter I explore cross-cultural differences as they relate to social psy­
chology. Of course, psychologists rely to a large degree on participants for 
their experiments, and so I discuss the typical volunteer and how limited the 
selection has been: almost all the experiments I discuss in this book were car­
ried out on American students between the ages of 18 and 21.
When psychologists do perform experiments with people from different cul­
tures, the results give fascinating insights into the different ways in which they 
think about themselves and see (sometimes quite literally) the world and each 
other. Contrasting views of the self appear to be central to these differences.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
These variations across the world have consequences for how people view 
society and relationships, the social judgements that they make and, in particu­
lar, what happens when people from different cultures interact with each other.
)>>
I suggest that although people from various parts of the world do think in 
different ways, these are not fundamental or irreconcilable differences. They 
are not due to physical or genetic differences, but are a result of being raised 
in a particular culture where particular aspects of the world are emphasised. 
These cultural mindsets are actually quite flexible. With simple techniques or 
shifts in emphasis, westerners can think like non-westerners and vice versa.
Meeting the People Who Take 
Part in Experiments
If you’ve ever flicked through any social psychology papers, you may notice 
that the ‘Participants’ section is rarely very interesting. The participants are 
usually college students enrolled in the same university as one of the authors 
of the paper.
This situation may strike you as being a problem. Psychologists want to be 
able to say things that are true of human beings in general, including around 
the world, but sometimes they seem to run experiments only on the single 
type of human beings that happen to be close by. They want to claim that 
‘all animals like to sit in laps and purr’ when they’ve only studied the house 
cat. Clearly this situation presents substantial issues as regards generalising 
results to different cultures.
Well, social psychologists are aware of and have studied this problem. Joe 
Henrich and colleagues investigated its extent by looking at a large number of 
psychology articles and paying close attention to the section on participants, 
a detail that many readers skim over.
)>>
They found that the huge majority of participants in psychology experiments 
are western, educated, and from industrialised, rich, democratic societies: in 
other words WEIRD. Although such people comprise 80 per cent or more of 
the participants in psychology research, they make up only 12 per cent of the 
people on the planet. (Check out Chapter 18 for more on being WEIRD.)
Some good reasons exist for this situation, of course: students are easy to 
find, easy to recruit and often participate for free. You can see why such a 
pervasive bias exists. For more details, check out the nearby sidebar ‘Why 
psychologists study the people they do’.

 Chapter 17: Bridging Cross-Cultural Dif⁜ferences
)>>
The situation with experiment participants is what it is and social psychologists 
have to work with what they can. More important is how much of a problem it is 
that the people in psychology experiments are quite different from most other 
human beings. Some people argue that it’s a massive problem if the aim is to 
generalise experimental findings to people who aren’t WEIRD. Looking across 
the globe, psychologists find that people can behave quite differently in psychol­
ogy experiments and in life. In the rest of this chapter I draw upon experiments 
that have been done on different people across the world and examine how 
their beliefs and thinking are quite different from the usual WEIRD participants 
that the rest of the book – and the rest of social psychology – has focused upon.
Why psychologists study the people they do
Psychological research is usually carried out in 
universities, and universities and scientists are 
expensive (although worth it, of course!).
At the risk of seeming reductive, in one sense 
being a student is a terrible waste. The years 18 
to 21 could be a very productive time of life in an 
economic sense, since young people are often 
more energetic, enthusiastic and healthy than 
the rest of society. Yet instead of putting people 
at that age to work, they waste their working 
potential: they sit in classes rather than working 
in the fields or in factories. Or – to put the point 
the other way round – only wealthy, industri­
alised countries can afford to send a large num­
bers of otherwise productive young people to 
universities. At this point in history, the wealthier 
countries tend to be western and democratic.
Plus, Henrich and colleagues found that two-
thirds of the participants in social psychology 
experiments are Americans and two-thirds are 
psychology undergraduates. In other words, 
just below half of participants in psychology 
experiments are the exact same people who’re 
reading the papers in college and later may 
become psychology researchers themselves.
Again, this is understandable. Right now, I’d have 
to pay about £10 an hour to each participant in 
my experiments. I’d expect to run 40 to 80 people 
in every experiment, with one to four experi­
ments in each paper. That’s several thousand 
pounds in participant fees for every paper.
But a bigger problem is recruiting: finding 
and persuading large numbers of people to 
come into my laboratory in London and give 
me an hour of their time. Even if I have a lot 
of funding and an effective recruitment pro­
cess, what sort of people may come into the 
lab? Presumably those who don’t have regular 
nine-to-five jobs, perhaps don’t have jobs at all 
or don’t have jobs that pay as well as £10 per 
hour. In short, paying participants is expensive, 
time-consuming and may result in a set of par­
ticipants that still doesn’t reflect the wider 
society.
But undergraduate students come for free. In 
most psychology departments, students are 
required as part of their degree to take part in 
a set number of experiments. I have all their 
names and email addresses and, like most 
departments, an automated online sign-up 
system. Plus the students, outside of lecture 
hours, have very flexible schedules and can 
attend during the day.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
Examining Western and 
Non-western Thinking
In this section I explore some of the experiments that have been done on 
people from different cultures and see how there are subtle but pervasive 
differences in how they think of themselves, other people and how they inter­
pret the world around them.
)>>
Until recently, the history of experimental psychology has been very much 
rooted in the western world. So, when I use terms such as ‘western’ and ‘non-
western’ I do so to distinguish a ‘western’ way of thinking that has tradition­
ally been studied and a ‘non-western way’, which is different and interesting in 
many other ways. For more on the complexities of such terms, take a look at 
the nearby sidebar ‘East versus west’.
In this section I use Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama’s method of 
describing the cultural differences of ideas of the self in the following terms:
)>>
✓)>>Independence: The traditional western view of identity, which is also 
sometimes identified as individualism.
)>>
✓)>>Interdependence: This contrasting view is widely held in non-western 
societies, and can also be distinguished with the term collectivism.
I describe how people differ in their views of the self and discuss how this 
distinction can relate to wider differences in perception and cultural prac­
tices, such as those surrounding the making of judgements.
Possessing different views of the self
The ways in which people describe themselves in social psychology experi­
ments can tell researchers a lot about how different cultures think about 
identity. I discussed how people understand their self-identity in Chapter 7, 
and the set of beliefs and biases they have to protect their self-esteem in 
Chapter 8. Here I discuss how much these findings can be generalised to 
people from different cultures.
In Chapter 7 I present an exercise in which I ask you to write out ‘I am . . . ’ 
ten times and then complete the statements with whatever description you 
want. When you give the same exercise to people across the world, system­
atic differences emerge.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Chapter 17: Bridging Cross-Cultural Dif⁜ferences
For example, American participants are most likely to list their psychologi­
cal attributes, such as their sense of humour or intelligence, and to mention 
their own attitudes as defining who they are. In contrast, Japanese people are 
more likely to qualify their statements in terms of the context. So rather than 
saying ‘I am generous’ or ‘I am diligent’, they may say, ‘I am generous with my 
friends and family’ or ‘I am diligent at work’. Researchers have identified and 
described these systematic differences.
Independent and individualistic
The ‘western’ way of thinking about the self is probably most familiar to 
you, as indeed it is to psychology. In this independent view, the self is seen 
as an enduring, independent internal state that has distinct characteristics. 
In other words, people have particular personalities, motives, dreams and 
desires, and these internal psychological states explain and cause their 
behaviour. This view of the self sees people as fundamentally separate from 
each other, or individualistic, because people are understood as being single 
units without thinking about larger groups.
Of course, in the western world, you have friends and family who are very 
important and influential in your life. No person is an island, as John Donne 
almost said. But imagine, as if in a science-fiction film, you fell into a worm­
hole and were thrown into a distant time and place: the Italian Renaissance 
or the Mughal Empire. Your intuition, I’m guessing, is that even though you’re 
East versus west
I use the term ‘western’ to mean roughly North 
American and European. By ‘non-western’ I 
mean the rest of the world. This distinction is 
rather blunt, I know, but in much of the discus­
sion of cultural differences, researchers focus 
in particular on the differences between North 
America and ‘non-western’ Asian countries, 
such as China and Japan.
Of course, these very broad distinctions don’t 
fit easily into an eastern and western division 
of the world map. Certain countries in Europe, 
such as Romania, and some Native American 
communities in North America have a more 
non-western style of culture. Contrasting a 
so-called western way of thinking with a non-
western way that covers the whole of the rest 
of the planet is overly simplistic.
Obviously, my claim isn’t that all western or all 
non-western people think in the same way. The 
claim is that even if we categorise people on 
this very broad distinction and average across 
these groups, subtle patterns and differences in 
thinking emerge.

in a radically different culture and surrounded by very different people, you’d 
remain, at heart, the same person. That’s the essence of the independent 
notion of the self.
Interdependent and collectivist
The interdependent construction of the self is that it’s fundamentally related 
to other people and the world around it. In countries such as China and 
Japan, but also areas of Africa and southern Europe, people think of them­
selves first and foremost in this collectivist manner: they think in terms of ‘we’ 
as much as they think of ‘I’. In these cultures, interrelationships are central 
rather than incidental.
For example, as a western individual, I think of myself as an individual who 
happens to be a father and a husband, who has a few graduate students 
working in his lab and several layers of bosses above in the dizzying hierar­
chy of the university. But if I were a member of an interdependent, collectiv­
ist culture, I’d see myself fundamentally in terms of my family members and 
my relationships to them; in terms of my responsibilities to my students 
and what I expect from them; and in the commitments and obligations to my 
superiors.
)>>
In this view, of course, I still have certain characteristics and habits, but 
they’re interwoven with these different social contexts. So it wouldn’t be 
remarkable if I acted assertively and unforgivingly in the context of work but 
was easy-going and meek at home. Who I am depends upon whom I’m with, 
and so naturally an interdependent self shifts and modulates according to 
context.
Displaying cultural differences 
in judgements
The contrast between the independent and interdependent self that I explain 
in the preceding section may remind you of discussions elsewhere in this 
book about whether the person or the situation causes social behaviour (in 
particular, the fundamental attribution error that I discuss in Chapter 9). The 
tendency from a western perspective is to over-emphasise the personal traits 
of people and underestimate the power of the situation. For this reason, 
people are very surprised about the behaviour of the prisoners and guards in 
the Stanford prison experiment (see Chapter 11) or the levels of obedience in 
the Milgram experiment (from Chapter 12).

 Chapter 17: Bridging Cross-Cultural Dif⁜ferences
In contrast, interdependent cultures have a different view of the self, placing 
the person in the background and focusing on the interrelationships between 
the individual and the context. So they would be more likely to accurately 
predict how people would behave in Milgram’s studies.
In this section I reveal that this difference in the understanding of people 
means that people from different cultures make different social judgements.
Recognising emotion
Experiments reveal that people from different cultures perceive different 
emotions in the same situation, and also that they go about interpreting emo­
tions in a very different way.
)>>
Imagine a picture of a boy, holding a basketball, smiling, standing in front of 
some other children. How would you describe the boy?
If you’re like the other western subjects in experiments by Takahiko Masuda 
and colleagues, you say that he looks happy. But if you’re from an interdepen­
dent, collectivist country, such as Japan or China, you may well say that the 
boy is gloating or sneering. People from that culture are more likely to look at 
the faces of the children standing behind the boy. They spot that the others 
are looking sad and tearful. In the context of other people and the situation 
around him, they reason that the boy has stolen that ball off the other chil­
dren and is cruelly mocking them.
This evidence is impressive, because not only does it show that people from 
different cultures make different judgements about emotions, but also that 
they literally look at the pictures differently. Eye-tracking technology shows 
that people from America look straight at the boy in the foreground, read his 
facial expression and give their answers. In contrast, participants from inter­
dependent cultures look at the boy and then spend more time fixing their 
attention on the people in the background.
Making moral judgements
In Chapter 9 I reveal that people in the west have a strong tendency to focus 
on facts about an individual’s personality, abilities and mood, as opposed 
to taking sufficient account of the situation: called the fundamental attribu­
tion error. I don’t mean to suggest that people in the west fail to understand 
that situations cause behaviour, but instead that they focus too much on the 
individual.

Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
)>>
People from interdependent cultures, however, are less likely to make this 
mistake, because they think about individuals in terms of their relationships 
to the situation and the other people around them. They have a broader focus, 
in a sense, and so are less likely to make the fundamental attribution error in 
controlled experiments.
For example, people from interdependent cultures tend to give different 
answers to the moral dilemmas that I raise in Chapter 9. To questions such as 
‘Would a friend borrow money from her parents without asking first, or date 
someone already in a relationship?’, people from an independent culture are 
more likely to give straight yes or no answers, whereas people from interde­
pendent cultures are more likely to say that it all depends on the situation.
Considering perceptual differences
You may be surprised to discover that people from different cultures pro­
cess information and even notice things differently. This does not appear 
to be due to anatomical or genetic differences in how the brain or the eyes 
are wired, since children from one country who are adopted and raised in 
another act in the same way as their adoptive parents. From this we know 
that the perceptual differences must be due to the learning process of being 
raised in a particular culture.
In an experiment, Takahiko Masuda, Richard Nisbett and colleagues show 
people an animation of a fish tank and ask ‘What do you see?’. What could be 
simpler, you many think: they’re both looking at the exact same animation.
)>>
Yet the results reveal a cultural difference. Westerners from independent cul­
tures describe events in terms of individual agents and their actions: for exam­
ple, ‘the orange fish swam back and forth’. But people from interdependent 
cultures are more likely to describe the events in terms of interrelationships 
between fish and objects: for example, ‘fish swam between the rocks and the 
weeds’.
This difference in perception extends into memory. Westerners from indepen­
dent cultures are better able to pick that orange fish out of a line-up if you 
present it to them again. People from interdependent cultures, however, have 
a hard time remembering individual fish unless they’re shown again with the 
same rocks and weeds in the background.
www.it-ebooks.info

269
 Chapter 17: Bridging Cross-Cultural Dif⁜ferences
Conversely, westerners from independent cultures have a poor memory for 
the rocks and weeds in the fish tank whereas people from interdependent 
cultures are far more likely to notice if items in the background are swapped 
around.
These experiments show that even when they are passively looking at the 
world around them, people from different cultures look at different things, 
interpret them in different ways and remember different aspects. If two 
people from different cultures look at the same TV show, they will literally 
see different things.
This attention to different elements in a scene means that people from differ­
ent cultures are more or less susceptible to visual illusions.
In a test, people are asked to judge whether a line is straight up vertically or 
at a slight angle. People can be tricked into giving the wrong answer in this 
task if the line is surrounded by a frame that’s slightly wonky. As you may 
predict by now, people from interdependent countries are more likely to be 
tricked by this illusion, because they’re more likely to attend to the relation­
ship between a central figure and the background. Westerners from indepen­
dent cultures have much less difficulty ignoring the frame and focusing on 
the line.
)>>
These perceptual differences in memory, attention and susceptibility to illu­
sions are not due to hard-wired differences between the memory or visual 
system of people from different parts of the world. The brain is above all else 
something that learns and absorbs things around it. These experiments show 
that growing up in one particular culture, the brain learns to focus, interpret 
and remember things in a particular way.
Testing the consequences of 
perceptual variations
The work of Masuda, Nisbett and their colleagues (such as the experiments 
I describe in the preceding section) shows that differences in culture can 
begin with the first moments of visual attention: where you direct your eyes 
into a scene. They then extend into the way you interpret what you see and 
how you remember it. These differences have been shown in the eye move­
ments, judgements and memory performance of participants in laboratory 
experiments, which caused Masuda and Nisbett to wonder if the same pat­
terns of behaviour are found outside of the laboratory.

Creating art
Masuda and Nisbett surveyed the paintings in the national galleries of Tokyo 
and New York. They counted very simple properties of the paintings, such 
as how many people were in the scene and their relative sizes. They found 
strong differences:
)>>
✓)>>A typical western picture has a single important person and a smaller 
number of other people in the background. Whenever you see such a 
picture you can identify in a moment the most important person. It’s the 
man (probably) standing in the middle: he’s the largest, has the most 
expensive clothes and has the light illuminating him.
)>>
✓)>>A typical Japanese painting depicts a large number of people, and 
they’re all roughly the same size. Imagine an emperor reclining on a 
throne surrounded by courtiers. In these pictures, you can figure out 
who the important person is, but only by studying the relative positions 
and alignments of each person.
Taking holiday snaps
You may object that the differences in the preceding section simply reflect 
artistic practices and, for example, the way that perspective is used in much 
western art. What about differences between people who aren’t artists, 
explicitly trained in the specific artistic traditions of a culture? To address 
this question, researchers looked at photographs taken by people from 
independent and interdependent cultures. If you look through their holiday 
snaps, you can notice a difference. In general, people from independent cul­
tures focus on the face of the people much more. People from interdependent 
cultures pull back and include more of the background scene.
Really revealing holiday snaps!
Anecdotally, my wife and I tested the hypoth­
esis that westerners focus on the individual 
and non-westerners more on the surroundings 
during a visit to Italy for a joint meeting of the 
European and Japanese science foundations.
One day we went on an excursion to the local 
sights. We passed our camera round to different 
scientists and asked them to take our picture. 
Sure enough, the Europeans took pictures in 
which we filled at least half of the image: some­
times, we could’ve been back in London for all 
you saw of Italy. The Japanese, however, took 
pictures where we were visible from head to 
foot, and the rest of the scene, even if it was a 
car park, was fully visible.

 Chapter 17: Bridging Cross-Cultural Dif⁜ferences
Raising children
To investigate the origins of the differences in cultures, Masuda and Nisbett 
visited some school classrooms. They looked at children’s drawings of a 
house and counted the same sorts of things that they had in the galleries. 
The same patterns were present:
)>>
✓)>>American children drew a small number of individuals, and usually had 
one person (themselves or their parents) much larger than all the other 
things.
)>>
✓)>>Japanese children drew with a flatter perspective, depicting more 
objects and people that were closer in size.
)>>
Differences between cultures can be seen from infancy onwards, in the behav­
iour of parents and the child.
For example, Linda Smith and her colleagues had parents in a lab play with 
their infants and a number of simple toys. They found that American parents 
are more likely to talk about things in relation to the infant’s preferences, 
asking, ‘Which is you favourite animal?’ and ‘Do you like this one?’, whereas 
Japanese parents point out the relationships between toys: ‘See, the donkey 
chases the cow.’
Later, the researchers examined several 4-year-old children from America 
and Japan and found that they differed in their abilities to find objects among 
complex arrays and to learn the names of objects and their relations. In other 
words, even children as young as four have already learnt to view the world 
in a slightly different way. Japanese children are already looking at and label­
ling the interrelationships between objects. The work of Linda Smith and col­
leagues suggests that part of the difference may stem from the way parents 
interact with their children.
These developmental studies show that all the cultural differences in memory, 
attention and perception that we find in adults may have their roots in the 
way that children of different cultures are raised and interact with their world.
Recognising What Cultures 
Have in Common
So far my discussion has been dedicated to exploring the differences between 
people from difference cultures. In one sense, those differences are pervasive 
and profound, as they can be seen in moment-by-moment eye movements, 
www.it-ebooks.info

272
Part V: Assessing Relationships, Groups and Societies 
in infants and adults and in social interactions and political systems. But in 
another sense, they are quite weak. I want to close this chapter by consider­
ing the ways that cross-cultural differences can be reduced, or even elimi­
nated, with simple techniques.
As I explain in Chapter 9, you can reduce or even reverse the fundamental 
attribution error by drawing people’s attention to different things, by word­
ing a question differently or showing them the view from a different angle. 
Similarly, cultural differences are often a matter of perspective and emphasis. 
A western person can think like someone from an interdependent culture, 
and vice versa, if different things are highlighted.
Social psychologists are also able to put people in different cultural mind-sets 
quite easily using the sorts of priming techniques I discussed in Chapter 5. 
For example, in one experiment, western participants were given a page of 
text to read. One group was told to circle all the occurrences of the word ‘I’ or 
‘me’ in the text. The other was told to circle ‘we’ or ‘us’. Then they were asked 
to make a judgment about the reasons for someone’s actions, in one of the 
standard attribution experiments that I discuss in Chapter 9. The western par­
ticipants who had been circling ‘I’ or ‘me’ behaved like participants in the stan­
dard version of the experiments, making the fundamental attribution error of 
ignoring the power of the situation. But the participants who had circled ‘we’ 
and ‘us’ now gave responses that were more like non-western participants, 
emphasising the situation when explaining the person’s behaviour, and under-
emphasising the person’s dispositions.
People from different cultures do not think about the world in a fundamen­
tally different way, they aren’t from different planets and they don’t hold 
completely incompatible views. Cultural differences may be pervasive, but 
they’re also the result of mind-sets that are flexible and can be changed by 
circumstance. With a little effort and a little empathy, people are always able 
to understand and relate to each other.

A

 world of difference exists between scepticism and cynicism: in short, 
scepticism is productive and cynicism isn’t. Unfortunately, many people 
are cynical about social psychology, and even science in general, arguing 
that it can never prove anything about people. I disagree, of course. As I 
show in this book, the scientific method can be rigorously applied to human 
behaviour.
But that method works only if all claims are examined with a critical, ques­
tioning mind (that’s the healthy scepticism part). Although non-scientists are 
sometimes surprised, scientists spend most of their time trying to demon­
strate that each other’s theories are ill-conceived, limited or just plain wrong. 
They don’t do so because they’re mean, competitive people who always want 
to be right (well, not just because of that!). They do so because questioning 
and challenging ideas and data is part of their method. Cynicism achieves 
little, but scepticism drives science forward.
In this chapter, I list ten questions that you, as a sceptical reader, should ask 
yourself while reading about a social psychology experiment. These ques­
tions connect to the ways in which the findings of an experiment can be exag­
gerated, its claims limited or its conclusions flawed.

Don’t view these questions as excuses to reject the experiment, but as reasons 
to carry out a better experiment yourself!

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
How Does the Result Generalise to 
Life Outside the Laboratory?
At some point in the life-cycle of a social psychology experiment, someone 
will try and generalise the results to life outside the laboratory. It may be the 
researchers themselves, when introducing or concluding their paper, or in a 
newspaper article or university press release promoting the research.
)>>
As a reader, remain sceptical of these claims. I don’t mean that they’re neces­
sarily right or wrong, but that generalisability to real life isn’t always the right 
criterion when judging scientific studies.
In field studies, this aspect is straightforward because they are based on 
studies of people in the real world, going about their everyday lives. For an 
example of a field study with relevance to everyday life, check out the nearby 
sidebar ‘Watching wildlife on the road’.
But laboratory studies aren’t always so straightforward. Remember that the 
goal of social psychology research is rarely to mimic the outside world within 
the laboratory. Take the Implicit Association Test that I discuss in Chapter 5 
(which reveals differences of tens of milliseconds in reaction times when 
subjects are, for example, categorising faces as White and words as positive, 
compared to when they’re categorising faces as Black and words as nega­
tive). Perhaps you can anticipate the type of objections – when do you ever 
have to categorise someone’s race while at the same time identifying whether 
words are positive or negative? And even if you did need to, does it matter to 
everyday life if you’re 30 milliseconds slower in one case? That’s literally the 
time it takes to blink.
Watching wildlife on the road
Researchers at the University of California, 
Berkeley were investigating the effects of social 
status on behaviour. In a wonderful field study, 
they stood on a street corner by a zebra cross­
ing and noted down how likely cars were to stop 
when they anticipated that a pedestrian was 
about to use the crossing. They also recorded 
the make and model of the car, and later figured 
out the approximate cost as an indirect measure 
of the social status of the driver.
They found that the more expensive the car, the 
less considerate the driver was of other people. 
This result is clearly and immediately applicable 
to real life. If you see a BMW coming towards 
you, be extra careful crossing the road!

277
 Chapter 18: Ten Questions for Getting the Most from Psychology Articles
But of course, the value of these results isn’t that the experiment looks like 
something you’d encounter in the real world. If you accept the interpretation, 
it’s that these small reaction time differences reveal how the mind organises 
and associates information, which in turn reveals something about implicit 
prejudice.
)>>
Although the situation of laboratory experiments isn’t like anything in the real 
world, they provide a vital way to test hypotheses and learn about the mind.
Are the Authors Really Measuring What 
They Claim to be Measuring?
I talk about this issue in Chapters 2 and 3: the technical term is operation­
alisation. A sceptical reader always considers whether researchers have 
correctly operationalised their concept (such as love, prejudice, fear or jeal­
ousy) into something that can be measured (such as ratings on a scale, reac­
tion times, eye movements or brain activation).
)>>
Rarely can you find one perfect operationalisation. If possible, the best 
approach is to use multiple converging ones. An example is the ‘culture of 
honour’ that I discuss in Chapter 2, where the consequences were opera­
tionalised in terms of ratings of anger, laughter and masculinity, into the dis­
tance between the participant and a threatening male, into the force of the 
participant’s handshake, and even the hormones secreted.
Are the Researchers from a 
Well-regarded University?
Every journal article lists the authors’ affiliation: the university or institute 
where the researchers work. Newspaper articles about research often lead 
with this information, such as ‘Scientists from Oxford University have discov­
ered that . . . ’.
)>>
How important is this information when you’re sceptically reading an article? 
The answer: not relevant, not at all, not in the least bit.
Nullius in verba (roughly translated as ‘Take no one’s word for it’) is the found­
ing motto of the Royal Society in London, perhaps the oldest scientific insti­
tution in the world. The point is that science doesn’t care who said what: it 
www.it-ebooks.info

278
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
doesn’t matter whether it was Aristotle, the Pope or Einstein. All that matters 
is the evidence in support of an idea. So whether the researchers have PhDs 
from Oxford or Harvard is irrelevant, as is whether they learnt everything 
they know from YouTube. All that matters is the evidence that they present.
Unfortunately, I’m being a bit idealistic here. In a field study on other scien­
tists, sneaky researchers submitted the same article to different journals and 
changed the affiliation of the authors to a highly regarded university and to 
a less famous, smaller university. Sadly, the former version of the paper was 
more likely to be accepted for publication by peer review. So even scientists 
sometimes fail to live up to the Royal Society’s motto.
How Many People Are in the Experiment?
Statistical techniques allow scientists to do something truly remarkable: they 
can quantify randomness. This is vital in science because patterns and differ­
ences in measurements occur all the time in the complicated, messy world.
)>>
Statistics allow scientists to quantify the probability that what they measure 
is due to random chance or a true difference between two things. After all, the 
more measurements you take, the more people are in your psychology experi­
ments and the more certainty you get. But how many people do you need in a 
psychology experiment?
Say you have a hypothesis that men are taller than women, on average. You 
stop the first man and the first woman on the street and measure them. As 
you may guess, the chances are that you’ll find that the man is taller. But 
about 1 out of 15 times you’ll find a taller woman. So how many men and how 
many women do you need to measure before you can be pretty confident 
that men are taller than women? In other words, how many men and women 
do you have to measure before you can be confident that the difference 
you observe is true of men and women in general and not just the men and 
women you happen to have measured?
Well it depends what you mean by ‘pretty confident’. But if you take the stan­
dard level of greater than a 5 per cent chance, and given how much height 
tends to vary in the human population, statistics tell you that you need to 
measure about eight people. The height difference between men and women 
is relatively large and stable. What if you want to measure something more 
subtle, such as how people would vote in an election?
For many surveys and political polls, typically about 1,000 people are ques­
tioned. To some people that seems like a very small number. How can you 
generalise from only 1,000 people to a whole country of millions of people? 
www.it-ebooks.info

279
 Chapter 18: Ten Questions for Getting the Most from Psychology Articles
In fact, statistical analyses show that – if the 1,000 people have been carefully 
and randomly selected – the average of their answers is within 1 or 2 per cent 
of the rest of the country. A pretty good representation. And the same analy­
ses show that doubling or tripling the number of people you survey results in 
only a very small improvement in the margin of error.
Stating the number of participants that’s sufficient for the average social 
psychology experiment is difficult, though. It all depends on how the differ­
ences are being measured, how many measurements are being taken and the 
amount of variability, either from randomness or from other factors.
For example, in some experiments the researcher may be asking people 
to make very rapid judgments about whether or not a face is trustworthy. 
The decision may take only a few hundred milliseconds, and the differences 
between experimental conditions may be only tens of milliseconds. On the 
other hand, the researchers would probably show hundreds of faces, giving 
hundreds of measurements for each participant.
At the other extreme, you may have a study in which the participant is per­
suaded (or not) to comply with an experimenter’s request. Although only one 
measurement exists for each subject, the differences between experimental 
conditions can be quite large. For example, in the classic foot-in-the-door 
experiment I discuss in Chapter 14, participants’ compliance went from 16 to 
74 per cent between experimental conditions.
)>>
So, I can’t give a simple answer to how many participants should be in a social 
psychology experiment. But a very rough rule is that you probably need at 
least 20 participants in each condition, or combination of conditions.
)>>
A more precise answer uses what’s called a power analysis. Experimenters esti­
mate the size of the difference they expect to find, the amount of variance or 
random noise in their measurements and how confident they want to be in their 
conclusion. A formula then tells them how many people they require in their 
experiment.
But remember that how many people are in your experiment isn’t the only 
important aspect; just as important is who they are (see the next section).
Are the Participants WEIRD?
Psychologists investigate the human mind, in all its variety and glory. They 
aim to understand why an angry mob decides to riot or go quietly home; 
why people first fall in love and why they stay married; how a charismatic

cult leader can compel his followers. Ironically, therefore, given the scope of 
psychology across the huge array of human experience, the huge majority 
of experiments are performed on slightly bored university undergraduates 
between the ages of 18 to 21. As a result, the people in psychology experi­
ments are WEIRD: an acronym for western and educated, from industrialised, 
rich, democratic societies.
This is important because, as I discuss in Chapter 17, the psychological dif­
ferences that exist between different cultures sway even simple, low-level 
perceptual processes. Even within western cultures, the students in psychol­
ogy experiments have many differences to non-students. For example, many 
are still teenagers and neuroscience shows that significant brain develop­
ment doesn’t stop in childhood, but continues up until early adulthood. 
Usually, undergraduates don’t have jobs, children or spouses and have differ­
ent motivators and goals to the rest of the population. They may have a dif­
ferent level of drug and video-game usage. They’re highly trained test-takers, 
which matters because many psychology experiments look like something 
between an exam and a video game. For views on how important these issues 
are (or aren’t), check out the nearby sidebar ‘Is being WEIRD important?’.
Is being WEIRD important?
Some people say that the problem of cultural 
and other differences can easily be overesti­
mated, because psychologists care less about 
how participants perform on a task and more 
about how their performance changes between 
experimental conditions.
For example, say that participants take part 
in an experiment playing Tetris and scientists 
measure their scores. You may object that 
students (and other WEIRD participants) have 
much more experience playing such games, 
and so are going to score higher than regu­
lar people. But more typically in experiments, 
psychologists compare between conditions. So 
the participants may be given coffee or not, and 
then their score changes are measured.
Although thinking that students do better than 
non-students is quite reasonable, perhaps for 
some reason they have a different physiologi­
cal response to caffeine to other people. The 
reply to this is that it’s a question that we can 
only answer with more experiments! We can’t 
simply assume that students respond to caf­
feine or any experimental manipulation in the 
same way as other people.

 Chapter 18: Ten Questions for Getting the Most from Psychology Articles
)>>
As a profession, psychologists are still arguing over the significance of WEIRD 
participants. Whenever you read a conclusion in a psychology paper, when­
ever they say ‘participants’ or ‘people’ try mentally adding the phrase ‘in 
western, educated, industrialised, rich, democracies’. Then look through 
Chapter 17 and see whether any evidence already suggests possible different 
conclusions for other types of people or other cultures.
Does the Experiment Involve Any 
Demand Characteristics?
Most participants are nice people and want to be good participants in your 
experiment. Although admirable, this tendency can cause problems for the 
experimenter. Participants in social psychology experiments change their 
behaviour according to what they think the experimenter wants (something 
that doesn’t happen for, say, chemists; a chemical solution doesn’t figure out 
that the researcher wants it to be more corrosive and so changes its acidity). 
But in psychology, participants can be influenced by (what they think) are 
the experimenter’s own expectations and beliefs.
These effects are called demand characteristics. They’re aspects of the experi­
ment or situation that cause participants to respond how they ‘should’ 
respond. (Check out the nearby sidebar ‘Demonstrating the demand charac­
teristic effect’ for examples of this effect in action.)
The idea of demand characteristics is similar to the idea of a placebo in medical 
research. People tend to experience the benefits and side effects that they’re 
told they’ll experience from a particular drug, even when they’re given a sugar 
pill with no physical effects at all. To negate this problem, the true effects of 
drugs are revealed by a double blind experimental design: neither the patient 
nor the doctor giving them the pill knows whether the medicine is a real drug 
or a harmless sugar pill.
)>>
Psychologists also aim for a double blind design. As a sceptical reader, ask 
whether participants could’ve guessed how the experimenter expected them 
to behave. Unfortunately, answering this question is difficult, because psycho­
logical experimental manipulations are often more complicated than slipping 
someone a pill, and there’s more scope for participant and experiment to influ­
ence results.
www.it-ebooks.info

282
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Was the Experimenter Blind 
to the Conditions?
If the experimenter knows what condition the participant is in, then they 
know how the participant is supposed to behave. Since they probably want 
their experiment to work, there is a danger that the experimenter will com­
municate their expectation to the participant in some way, and so influence 
their behaviour. If that happens, it’s bad news, because the experiment will 
show an effect of the experimenter’s beliefs, rather than the participants’ true 
behaviour. I will explain how this can happen, and what experimenters can 
do it avoid it.
Say that you want to test the simple hypothesis that thinking about one’s 
family and friends increases friendly, pro-social behaviour towards a stranger. 
For the experimental manipulation you ask people to list the ‘ten people that 
you feel closest to emotionally’ or have them do nothing. After completing 
the task, an experimenter walks up to them and engages them in conversa­
tion. The interaction is videotaped, and later the experimenter watches the 
video and rates the friendliness of each participant on a scale of 1 to 9. You 
compare the ratings for those who made the list and those that didn’t.
As you may realise, this experimental design has some fatal flaws:
)>>
✓)>>Quite possibly, the experimenter’s knowledge of the experimental condi­
tion can change how he interacts with the participant.
Demonstrating the demand characteristic effect
Participants were hooked up to a lie detector 
that measured tiny differences in their sweating 
behaviour and asked to lie to the experimenter. 
One group were told that only psychopaths and 
criminals were able to fool the lie detector and 
the other that most intelligent, emotional stable 
people could fool it.
These two groups of people had very dif­
ferent skin responses after being told that 
they’d fooled the lie detector successfully (or 
not). Those who believed that only criminals 
could fool the lie detector started sweating 
if the detector didn’t signal they were lying. 
Those who believed that all intelligent people 
could fool the detector sweated less when 
informed that they’d successfully deceived the 
detector.

 Chapter 18: Ten Questions for Getting the Most from Psychology Articles
琀
屴Imagine that a friend whispers in your ear at a party, ‘I have to introduce 
you to this person, he’s really friendly and charming.’ Or your friend 
says, ‘I have to introduce you to this person, he’s rather mean and no 
one wants to talk to him.’ As you turn round to meet the new person, 
you can imagine that your expression and initial demeanour may be 
quite different in these two cases. Well, the same can apply (albeit to a 
lesser extent) for the experimenter meeting a participant that he expects 
to be either more or less friendly because of the experimental condition. 
And the attitude of the experimenter in turn affects how friendly the par­
ticipant appears. In this way, the experimenter’s knowledge changes the 
behaviour of the participant.
)>>
✓)>>The second major flaw is that the experimenter rating the participants’ 
behaviour also knows which experimental condition they are in. People 
tend to see information that confirms their beliefs and ignore informa­
tion that contradicts them. So if the rater expects the participant to 
be friendly, he may well notice a small smile; whereas the same mouth 
movement may be dismissed as an insincere smirk by a rater who 
expects unfriendly behaviour.
Luckily, you can easily solve these problems with careful experiment design. 
The condition that the participant is in can be assigned randomly by the 
person picking a sealed envelope, or be chosen by a computer. The condi­
tion’s then a secret to the experimenter interacting with the participant, and 
secret from a different experimenter rating the videos.
)>>
Here are the two key questions to ask, as a sceptical reader:
)>>
✓)>>Did the experimenter interacting with the participant know what condi­
tion the person was in, and could the experimenter have conveyed his 
expectations to the participant at all?
)>>
✓)>>Sometimes we use objective measures of behaviour like button presses 
or brain activation. Sometimes we use more subjective measures, like 
rating how friendly or how aggressive someone acted. In this case, it’s 
important to ask, did that rater know what condition the participant was 
in and how the person ‘should’ have acted?
What Was the Control Condition?
In Chapter 2 I discuss the importance of a well-chosen control condition, 
which has to match the experimental condition in every way possible, except 
for the thing that you’re trying to study. This is very hard to get right for 
an experimenter, and very easy to miss for the reader. In short summaries,

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
press releases and newspaper write-ups of experiments, everyone tends to 
focus on the dramatic effect of the experimental condition – such as do video 
games cause aggressive behaviour? – and the control condition gets ignored 
in the background, even though it’s the aspect of an experiment that allows 
psychologists to make strong scientific conclusions. I provide an example in 
the nearby sidebar ‘This game makes me so mad!’.
)>>
In many social psychology experiments, the key question to ask from a scepti­
cal angle is about any differences between the control and experimental condi­
tions that can explain the behaviour. If these differences aren’t related to the 
experimenters’ hypothesis or claims, you have good grounds to doubt those 
claims.
Does Common Sense Support 
the Conclusion?
In Chapter 3, I suggest that common sense is the nemesis of social psychol­
ogy. The reason is that after the results of a study are known, claiming that 
the results merely confirm what you’d expect anyway is all too easy. Such 
hindsight bias pervades people’s day-to-day thinking: when something is 
known they often feel that they knew it all along.
This game makes me so mad!
Imagine a study that investigates the link 
between aggression and video-game use. The 
experimenters measure participants’ aggres­
sion, ask them to play a violent video game for 
30 minutes and then measure aggression again. 
They find that aggression increases, which 
didn’t happen when participants did nothing for 
30 minutes in a control condition. So do violent 
video games increase aggression?
Well, before the experimenters can leap to 
this conclusion, they would need to account 
for the many differences between playing a 
violent video game and doing nothing. For 
example, many people enjoy playing video 
games and don’t like sitting still doing noth­
ing. So in the experimental condition you can 
give people an enjoyable task for 30 minutes 
and then force them to stop, and in the con­
trol condition you give them an unpleasant, 
boring task, and finally allow them to stop. 
You wouldn’t be surprised that the people 
playing the video games feel a bit annoyed, 
and therefore aggressive; you’ve just taken 
away their toy!

Sometimes, psychology papers try and cash in on support from so-called 
common sense. For example, in Chapter 3 I discussed a paper that found 
support for the common sense ‘fact’ that heterosexual men have a higher 
number of sexual encounters than heterosexual women (even though that’s 
logically impossible). As a sceptical reader you always need to stay wary of 
‘common sense’.
Does a Simpler Explanation Exist?
As with much in life, the simplest answer is often right.
A few years ago, I read an evolutionary psychology paper that claimed that 
the level of testosterone in new fathers decreases with the increasing number 
of hours they spend with their infants. The claim was that this decrease was 
the result of an evolved mechanism.
At the time I was on paternity leave looking after my twin babies with my 
wife. I was in the house all the time and, according to this research, my tes­
tosterone levels must have been at eunuch levels. The paper implied that to 
ensure that I stayed at home and tended to my children, rather than dashing 
out to hunt or impregnate another female, some adaptive mechanism low­
ered my testosterone level in response to the presence of infants, and hence 
reduced my aggressive behaviours.
This claim raises many questions – does the sight of babies lower testoster­
one? The smell? But before thinking more about evolved mechanisms of hor­
mone regulation in childcare, I decided to look into simpler explanations; and 
it turns out that a rather simple one exists.
One thing changes testosterone levels quite readily: sleep. And if there’s one 
thing new fathers don’t have much of, it’s sleep. So, just as the original study 
found, the degree to which fathers are involved in childcare and night feed­
ings predicts the amount that they sleep, which changes the amount of tes­
tosterone they produce. A much simpler explanation.

Ten Great Ways to Delve Deeper 
into Social Psychology
In This Chapter
▶)>>Using all the available resources
▶)>>Communicating with experts
A

 few hundred years ago, a true scholar in a subject was able to have read 
literally everything ever written on a particular topic. The challenge was 
locating, possessing or copying the rare items of written material. Nowadays, 
with such a vast amount of information available so easily, the problem is 
sorting and identifying what’s important and – crucially – what isn’t.
In this chapter, I describe ten ways to discover more about social psychology. 
I show you how to locate research articles online and how to follow connec­
tions between papers. I look at some of the big psychological societies and 
what they offer, as well as some specialist websites that collect specific social 
psychology resources. I also discuss how social media is being used to filter 
information and take part in scientific debate. These are exciting times for 
the professional and the interested layperson alike.
Consulting Research Journals
Psychologists write textbooks, give lectures and even have YouTube chan­
nels. But the most important product of their job is the research article. 
These articles are what they’re judged by, where they lay out their theories 
and present their evidence. If you want to discover more about social psy­
chology, you need to read research articles.
)>>
If it’s been published in a journal, the article has been peer-reviewed, which 
means that two or three other independent scientists have read the paper 
closely, criticised it and challenged the evidence as strongly as they can. The 
reviewing is even done anonymously, so that the reviewers can be as critical as 
they want without fear of repercussion. Sometimes the paper is rejected out of 
www.it-ebooks.info

288
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
hand. Sometimes the authors are told that they have to re-do some experiments, 
or even re-write the paper, and submit to another round of critical review. Only 
after the authors have gone through that process is the paper published.
Unfortunately, many journal articles, which are the result of painstaking and 
expensive research, aren’t made freely available to the people who funded 
the research: the taxpayer. The situation is changing, but right now you can 
only access journal articles from a publisher’s website if you’re connected 
to a university or library network, and if those universities or libraries have 
paid a hefty access fee to the publishers.
If you’re lucky enough to be able to use the resources of a large university, 
you should be able to access most academic journals through its portal. Or 
you can try searching one of these databases of journal articles:
)>>
✓)>>PsychINFO: www.apa.org/psycinfo 
琀
屴The largest database of psychology-related articles and abstracts, main­
tained by the American Psychological Association.
)>>
✓)>>ScienceDirect: www.sciencedirect.com
琀
屴A big conglomeration of journals with advanced search options and 
email alerts.
If you aren’t a member of a university or close to a large public library, you 
have two options:
)>>
✓)>>Use open-access journals, which have become more widespread. 
Anyone with an Internet connect can download these papers for free. 
(The only downside is that researchers have to pay a fee when their 
articles are accepted.) This way of publishing is increasing in popularity, 
and open-access journals are growing in their impact. Right now, these 
are the two big players:
琀
屴Frontiers: www.frontiersin.org/Psychology
琀
屴PLOS ONE: www.plosone.org/browse/social_psychology
)>>
✓)>>Google the articles that you want (see the next section).
Becoming a Google Scholar
More than anything, scientists want people to read their work. They’re quite 
different from authors or artists who get paid each time someone buys their 
book or downloads a song. They draw a salary, do their research and when 
it’s published, they want everyone to know about it. And so, even though 
journal publishers want to charge people to download an article from their 
www.it-ebooks.info

289
 Chapter 19: Ten Great Ways to Delve Deeper into Social Psychology
journal website, you often find that scientists find a way to post electronic 
copies of their articles on their home or university website, where anyone 
can freely download them.
Google knows all about these journal papers on the Internet. So the chances are 
that you can just type in the title of any research article (particularly if it was 
published in the last ten years) and Google finds a free copy available online.
)>>
Google also has a special academic search engine called Google Scholar 
(scholar.google.co.uk), which looks specifically for research articles that 
are online, rather than all webpages. You can search for the title of a paper, or 
enter the authors and the publication date, and it has a very good chance of 
finding the paper. Look for ‘pdf’ in the search results for a full text version of 
the paper that you can read. It can also tell you what other papers have cited 
the paper that you found. This is a useful function that other websites also 
provide, but Google’s probably has the biggest reach.
A cited reference search is very useful because you can read about a study 
and be struck with an idea for an interesting new twist. For example, imag­
ine that you read about the Cyberball experiment by Kip Williams (which I 
describe in Chapter 13) and wonder whether people’s response changes by 
their attachment style (see Chapter 15). With a cited reference search, you 
can find all papers that have cited the original experiment and see whether 
someone else has already had the same thought and collected the data.
Looking up Psychological Societies
Several large, well-funded and well-organised psychological societies exist 
and their websites are well worth poking around. You find announcements 
for upcoming conferences, job vacancies and graduate programmes. These 
societies sometimes run prominent journals in the field and post free content 
on their websites.
Many of these societies have a mission to persuade people that psychology 
is relevant and important outside of academia, and so they have excellent 
resources demonstrating how psychology intersects with politics, econom­
ics, education and everyday life. Check out the following:

Using the Social Psychology Network
The social psychology network (www.socialpsychology.org) is an excel­
lent resource for students, academics and scientists.
Most researchers in the field seem to be members and have a small page 
describing their interests and linking to their own lab websites (bear in 
mind that the picture of me was taken before I had children and when I still 
had hair!). The network lists psychology graduate programmes, teaching 
resources and experiments that you can take part in online.
)>>
Perhaps one of the most useful resources is a huge list of social psychology 
links sorted by subtopic. With this, you can easily find the labs that are look­
ing at, say, the relationship between social psychology and legal issues, how 
psychologists are tackling homophobia or the role they play in political elec­
tions. Going through lists saves you a lot of endless googling and takes you 
straight to the interesting researchers in the field.
Prejudice and Bias: Highlighting 
Two Useful Websites
I want to highlight two particularly useful websites for you, because they 
give excellent in-depth discussions of prejudice and bias, arguably one of the 
most important applications of social psychology to politics and everyday 
life. Crucially, each website doesn’t just describe and discuss scientific under­
standing of prejudice, they have experiments that you can participate in. 
This gives you, arguably, a direct measure of your own implicit prejudice, and 
gives you an insight into what it is like to be part of a psychology experiment.

Communicating via Blogs
The number of blogs devoted to psychology and the quality of the writing 
astounds me. Only a few years ago, many in the scientific community dis­
missed blogs as little more than vanity projects. Now you can read about the 
latest findings and find cutting-edge debate.

 Chapter 19: Ten Great Ways to Delve Deeper into Social Psychology
Blogs have the great strength of immediacy. Journal articles can take months, 
even years, to reach print. I’ve read (what I thought was) a great journal 
article that came out that morning, and by the evening seen a brilliant and 
convincing counterargument against the paper’s claims.
Blogs are also interactive. You can post comments and directly engage with 
the author. Scrolling down through these comments and arguments is often 
worthwhile, because many are posted by other scientists. Debates that 
started in blog comment sections have sparked whole research projects. This 
sort of discussion is often at the heart of scientific progress. For example, 
you can see the enormous volume of Darwin’s letters on display in a museum 
in Cambridge. But now, thanks to an active and engaged blogging community, 
you can peer into such debates as they happen.
)>>
Some scientists are still sceptical about blogs because, unlike research arti­
cles, they aren’t peer-reviewed (see the earlier section ‘Consulting Research 
Journals’). Anyone with an Internet connection can have a blog on social psy­
chology and post whatever they want. Although that’s true, it misses the point 
of blogs. Few bloggers would argue that their posts are meant to rival peer-
review articles. In fact, often blog posts are describing, promoting or discuss­
ing journal articles. And if a blogger’s analysis is wrong, readers can have their 
say in the comments section.
My view is that you can find some wonderful writing and debate in blogs. You 
should certainly read everything with a critical eye, but that’s exactly how you 
should read journal articles too! So if you’re doing Internet research for your 
own article or paper, read as many blog posts as you can. Remember though 
that blogs are a way of disseminating opinions, and the most important thing 
is the hard evidence in support of any claim. So when a blog post discusses a 
research finding, be sure to read the original peer-reviewed paper as well. Get 
as close to the data as you can!
Here are just a few of my favourite blogs in social psychology. I list website 
addresses and Twitter handles if they have them:

Following Twitter Feeds
A friend told me that whereas the essence of Facebook is ‘Look at me!’, the 
essence of Twitter is ‘Look at this!’. Although you can’t say very much in 140 
characters, you can tell people where to find new and interesting stuff, and 
that’s the genius of Twitter. For me, and many other scientists, it has become 
a vital scientific tool.
The array of information on the Internet is dizzying, and growing every minute. 
Your entire day can grind to a halt wandering through blogs, Wikipedia and 
the online news . . . not to mention the funny cat videos. For this reason, the 
brevity of Twitter is its great strength. I don’t have time to visit all the blogs 
that interest me and read the table of contents of every journal that’s relevant 
to my work. So instead, I subscribe to the Twitter feed of each blog author 
and each author, and just scan through my feed during the day. I get the titles 
of new articles as they’re posted online in my favourite journals. I follow the 
scientists who do work in my field, and when they publish a new article, they 
tweet, and I find out about it. But mostly, I find out about stuff because a friend 
or colleague reads a paper, likes it and tweets a link.
In addition to the bloggers with Twitter feeds I mention in the preceding sec­
tion, here are some other people I find worth following in social psychology:

Taking Online Classes
An exciting new movement in higher education is going on to put university 
courses online. Sometimes this means putting recordings of lectures on iTunes 
where anyone can download and view them, as if they’re sitting in on the class.
MOOCs (massive open online courses) take the idea one step further – you 
also participate in the class as a student, taking exams and uploading essays. 
No one quite knows where this trend will lead. Perhaps campus universities 
will go the way of video rental stores, replaced by downloads, or maybe the 
experience of being in the same lecture hall or tutorial room is of irreplace­
able educational value.
You can freely download excellent quality lectures and take part in social psy­
chology courses from across the world. Check out the following for starters:

Listening to TED Talks
The TED foundation has a remarkable collection of short, inspiring and diverse 
lectures from leading scientists, artists, engineers and political activists (www.
ted.com). They’re all freely available. The site includes many talks by famous 
psychologists (you can search by topic), but I also urge you to watch talks from 
non-psychologists as well, and think about the social forces (cognitive disso­
nance, naive realism, techniques of persuasion, and so on) that are underlying 
discussions of climate change, marketing and political debate.
As with blog posts, Wikipedia articles and journal articles, I recommend 
strongly that you watch these lectures with a sceptical eye. TED talks are 
very short, and their emphasis is on wowing an audience with stirring con­
clusions, as opposed to overwhelming them with data. By their nature, they 
rarely present strong evidence for their claims.
)>>
So be inspired and entertained by the talks, but always seek the evidence 
afterwards. Hunt down the ‘why’ behind the ‘wow’!
Working with Wikipedia Effectively
The first time I heard Wikipedia mentioned by an academic, he said the word 
with a wince, much like a waiter at a posh restaurant repeating a request for 
ketchup. The feeling was that Wikipedia simply didn’t belong in the proper 
academic world. I think that, thankfully, this view is rapidly changing.
My opinion is that Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.com) is an excellent research 
tool, something that you can use early on in the process of writing a paper or 
understanding a topic. It can give you a detailed, intelligent and comprehen­
sive overview of a topic like few other sources. I certainly use it extensively 
when I’m preparing lectures about an area that’s new to me, or even for a 
familiar area in which I want to explore a new angle.
)>>
The mistake that some people make, however, is to read no further than a 
Wikipedia article. As with all the sources of information and inspiration I men­
tion in this chapter, you have to track down the evidence behind the claims 
and look at the experiments, data and original claims yourself. Use Wikipedia 
as a way to find ideas and material, not as an endpoint itself. So I encourage 
you to use and support Wikipedia. Its scope and depth is probably unrivalled 
and certainly nothing’s better for the price.
