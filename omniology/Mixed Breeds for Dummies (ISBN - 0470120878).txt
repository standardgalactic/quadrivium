Dedication
For my mother, Dr. Rona M. Fields, who instilled in me the desire to
succeed regardless of the obstacles.
For my first mixed breed dog, Huxley, who gave her loyalty and love
to three growing children.
For my current mixed-breed dog, Princess, who’s thrilled to be
loved, though she believes that entails sitting in someone’s lap —
even though she weighs 50 pounds.
To my husband, for his patience, love, and dedication to all I do.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Because I’ve been writing books for 15 years, I’ve long been aware
of the difficulty of bringing them to press and promoting their sale.
Both my parents are writers, so you can say it’s in my blood.
Regardless of whether or not my writing was published, the sheer
art and use of my imagination was the reward. However, several of
my publishers have made the art more enjoyable. Wiley Publishing
is one of them.
I’d like to thank all those at Wiley Publishing who have had the 
faith in me to produce the book they envisioned, especially Stacy
Kennedy, my acquisitions editor, whom I’ve known for many years.
I’d also like to thank my project editor, Elizabeth Kuball, for her
endless support, helpful suggestions, and the ability to keep me on
my toes and delivering the work in short order, regardless of my
hectic schedule.
Thanks also to Jean Krason, DVM, who let me pick her brain while
we worked on a West Virginia Lottery television commercial
together with her Australian Shepherd, Kaila. During our waiting
periods (of which there are many in production work), she helped
me learn more about breed-related health issues, as well as general
veterinary and first-aid information.
Thanks also, to Nicole Quinn, DVM, my technical editor, for main-
taining my accuracy.
Most of all, I want to thank all the mixed-breed dogs I’ve known and
trained, because nobody teaches a trainer more than the animal
students she works with.

Mixed Breeds For Dummies

Introduction
A
mixed-breed dog, as the name implies, is one that’s a mix of
two or more breeds — as opposed to purebred dogs, which
can trace their lineage back to purebred parents and grandparents
and on and on. Believe it or not, mixed-breed dogs are more numer-
ous than purebred dogs and, until recently, they were thought of as
less-than-ideal pets and companions. But with the new designer-dog
hybrid craze, all that has drastically changed. Many people are will-
ing to spend upwards of $2,000 for a mixed-breed dog just because
they know the dog’s parents were purebreds.
Even though mixed-breed dogs — designer or not — may not 
have consistent attributes (like size and appearance), they can
make great companions, often with fewer physical problems than
pedigreed dogs.
I should know: I’ve been training dogs for more than 30 years. 
Plus, my studies in psychology and zoology have gone a long 
way toward helping me understand why dogs behave the way 
they do. I’ve written and published numerous articles and books
about dogs, their behavior, care, breed specifics, and training. I’ve
researched numerous breeds, including their characteristics and
behavior. And as a professional trainer, I’ve worked with many
breeds and breed mixes, teaching them to behave and live harmo-
niously with their human companions as well as other animals.
In this book, I’ve brought together all the material you need to help
you live with and train your mixed-breed dog. Remember: A dog
doesn’t have to have a pedigree to be a good companion. It merely
has to have quality care, guidance, consistency, and understand-
ing. Mixed Breeds For Dummies will help you develop a great rela-
tionship with your mixed-breed dog.
About This Book
Although you’ll find all kinds of useful information in each chapter 
of this book, you don’t have to read it all to benefit from it. Each
chapter contains all the tools you need to accomplish specific goals.
Though this book declares to be about mixed-breed dogs it’s actually
about all dogs, because mixed-breed dogs are the combinations of
many dogs. Although designer dogs are actually hybrids, consisting
of the breeding of two purebreds, mixed breeds often contain more

than two breeds — sometimes as many as ten, or more, depending
on the genetics of the parents. The information in this book pertains
to all breeds of dogs, so whether you have a mixed breed or a pure-
bred dog, you’ll benefit from reading this book.
Also, it’s true that I have lots of credentials — from degrees to 
publications to hands-on experience — but this book isn’t about
my standing up on a soapbox and lecturing you. I know you’re
busy, so in this book, I tell you only what you need to know and
nothing that you don’t.
Conventions Used in This Book
Because dogs are living, breathing, thinking creatures, deserving
respect, I don’t refer to them as it — instead, I use he or she, even 
if the dog is neutered or spayed (always a good idea). I also try to
alternate the use of he and she, to keep the peace. Finally, I use just
a few conventions you should be aware of:

Foolish Assumptions
Because you’ve picked up this book I assume you’re not a dummy.
You’re either thinking of getting a mixed-breed dog or you already
own one. Plus, the fact that you want to find out more about your
dog makes you exceptionally intelligent. I make some other
assumptions about you:
Mixed Breeds For Dummies 
2

 I assume you have, or are about to get, a mixed-breed dog
because you wanted a unique individual to love and live with.
 I assume that you want just the facts you need to make 
certain you accomplish your goals. You don’t want all the 
scientific jargon and terminology explaining the background
of each topic.
 I assume you have a big heart to take on a dog and give her a
happy home.
How This Book Is Organized
I divided Mixed Breeds For Dummies into six easy-to-follow parts in
which you can either find out more about your dog’s background
or get into the meat of care, training, or fun activities.
You don’t have to read the parts or chapters in any particular
order, because each is self-contained. Read the chapters that 
are of the most interest to you first and if you have the time and
desire, read the others.
Part I: Just the Facts Ma’am
The hidden lives of mixed-breed dogs. This section delves into the
dark alleys and vacant buildings; places that dogs meet, breed, and
bear their young with very little, if any, human intervention. Also in
this section you can read about the designer-dog craze. What con-
stitutes a designer dog and why they are so popular that people
are willing to spend thousands of dollars on one?
Each mixed breed is an individual — one of a kind. In order to
understand your dog, you have to find out as much as you can
about his genetic attributes, which will contribute to his overall
behavior and demeanor.
In this part, I also show you where to find a mixed-breed dog and
how to temperament-test him so that you can ensure you’ll give
him a forever home and he’ll always be part of your heart. From an
animal shelter, to breeder, to foster care, there are many places to
find mixed-breed dogs — but you’ll need to look around a bit before
knowing which dog is right for you. You’ll know it’s the right dog
when you feel your heart say, “Wow! I can’t live without that dog!”
Part II: Living with Your 
Mixed-Breed Dog
After you choose your dog, you’ll need to prepare for her. From her
first day in your home, you’ll need to give her specific household
Introduction

rules. Also, dogs require a special space for containment. And, for
the sake of your dog’s safety, you’ll need to remove dangerous or
loose articles that may be chewed or eaten.
So many pet products are available — how will you know what 
to buy? Don’t worry — in this part, I give you a list of the items
you’ll need.
This part also explains the importance of proper nutrition, veteri-
nary care, grooming, bathing, and daily checks for injury, para-
sites, and abnormalities.
Part III: Training 101
One of the first things you have to do with a new dog is house-
training. Chapter 10 tells you how, along with scheduling the relief
times, crate training, and guiding your dog to go in a specific area.
This chapter also shows you how to teach a small dog how to use
an indoor potty zone such as paper or a litter pan. A very special
part of this chapter covers how to teach your dog to ring a bell to
let you know he has to relieve himself.
Basic training is a must for any dog. This section covers all you
need to prepare yourself and your dog for positive reinforcement
techniques, so both of you will have fun. From the three steps of
training success — lure, click, and reward — to simple commands
and distraction proofing. Chapter 11 also explains how to find a
professional trainer and the various approaches to dog training.
Some mixed-breed dogs who come from shelters or unhappy 
backgrounds may have some behavioral issues that you’ll have to
deal with. Chapter 12 explains how to recognize the symptoms of
separation anxiety along with how to help your dog overcome this
prevalent problem. I also tell you how to deal with some common
behavior problems, such as jumping up, begging, nipping, digging,
and chewing.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy
I begin this part by telling you how to find a good veterinarian, 
as well as the ins and outs of neutering/spaying, one of the most
important aspects of being responsible for a mixed-breed dog.
From regular check-ups to vaccinations and controlling parasites,
your veterinarian can help you keep your mixed-breed dog in the
pinnacle of health and well-being.
In this part, I also cover first aid — a very important topic. Through-
out your dog’s life, anything can happen — from injuries to illness,
from poisoning to weather-related reactions, such as heat stroke. 
Mixed Breeds For Dummies

As your mixed-breed dog ages, she’ll have specific health issues
that need to be addressed. Your dog’s behavior will also change
with age. She’ll be slower to respond, because her eyesight and
hearing aren’t as sharp as when she was younger. In this part, I
explain why and how these changes may affect your senior dog.
Sadly, you’ll need to know when it’s the right time to say good-bye
to your old friend. In this part I help you move on from the loss of
your dog and help you know when to give love to a new one.
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog
Dog shows aren’t just for purebred dogs. Several mixed-breed dog
clubs offer the same opportunities to show off your mixed breed.
One of the most exciting activities I’m involved with is production
work. My mixed-breed dog, Princess, has been an actress since she
completed her obedience training. Film directors love the unique
appearance of mixed-breed dogs. There’ll never be a shortage of
work for them in TV commercials and feature films. In this part, I
tell you how you and your dog can see his name in lights.
If you enjoy outdoor activities, you’re bound to find a mixed-breed
dog who will love to share them with you. From hiking, camping,
and boating to swimming and horseback riding, I know my own
mixed breed can’t get enough. I’m sure your dog will love it, too.
Knowing what to pack when traveling with your dog is very impor-
tant. Chapter 17 explains how to prepare for a trip and what to
bring with you while traveling. Plus, it discusses what to do if your
dog decides to go for a walkabout while you’re away from home.
What will you do for your dog when you can’t bring him with you?
You have many options, and knowing more about them will help you
make the right decision for your dog and you. In this part, I fill you in.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Ah, one of the most fun parts of a For Dummies book, The Part 
of Tens.
Knowing why you absolutely must neuter or spay your dog is a 
key part of owning one in the first place. In this part, I tell you how
spaying/neutering can be helpful to your dog, how it can be helpful
to you, and how it can be helpful to your community.
I end the book with a chapter on ten places to find mixed-breed
events. There’ll be no shortage of activities you can do with your dog.

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little eye-catching pictures in the margin of this
book. These icons are eye-catching for a reason: They flag impor-
tant information. Here’s what they mean:
The Tip icon helps you solve problems faster or explains an easier
way to approach an issue.
The Warning icon prevents you from doing something dangerous
to your dog, yourself, or others. Heed this icon!
The Technical Stuff icon precedes interesting information, though
not vital to your mixed-breed dog’s well-being. Although you really
don’t need to read the information preceded by a Technical Stuff
icon, you won’t lose much time doing so, and it may help you
understand your dog better.
The Remember icon helps you stay on track in maintaining your
dog’s health and well-being. This information is so important I may
say it twice!
Where to Go from Here
Because this book is written in a modular manner — with each
chapter a standalone unit — you don’t have to read everything in
order. In fact, if you already have a mixed-breed dog, you won’t
need to read the chapters on where to find a dog, nor will you need
the information on making sure the dog is right for you. If you get a
designer dog, you might want to find out more about how to train
her than solve problems that she likely hasn’t developed. Or, if
you’ve had a mixed-breed dog for many years and are curious
about the changes he’ll be going through as he ages, you may want
to skip to the chapter about senior dogs. Use the Table of Contents
and Index to find the chapters that appeal to you now, and come
back to this book as your needs and interests change.
Regardless of where you begin reading, you’re sure to discover
new things giving you the inspiration to spend time with your
mixed breed and enhance your lives.
Yours is a partnership for life. Have fun together!

Part I
Just the Facts,
Ma’am

In this part . . .
W
hat is a mixed-breed dog? Why are mixed-breed
dogs often treated poorly in comparison with pure-
bred dogs? Why are most of the feral dogs mixed breeds?
Why do they overpopulate animal shelters and humane
societies? This part answers these questions and more.
Mixed-breed dogs are every bit the best friend that any
purebred dog can be. They give their loyalty, love, and
companionship. They willingly learn and play with you.
Many will guard your home and family. Mixed-breed dogs
don’t know that they don’t have pedigrees. All they know
is that they want to make you happy!
Since the mid-1990s, a special brand of mixed-breed dog
has become every bit as popular as many purebred dogs.
This hybrid, a combination of two purebred dogs, is
termed a designer dog. Designer dogs come in all shapes,
sizes, and colors. Though some have been very nearly
standardized — such as the Labradoodle, Puggle, and
Cockapoo — many aren’t. Hybrid dogs can take on the
characteristics of either parent, and unless a breeder has
ﬁgured out a speciﬁc parenting combination, the appear-
ance and temperament of the offspring is rarely a known
factor. In this part, I ﬁll you in on why the ﬁrst designer
dogs (the Labradoodle and Cockapoo) were originally bred,
as well as the pros and cons of owning a designer dog.
In order to fully understand any dog, you’ll need to know
more about the breeds that your own mixed-breed dog
might contain. Your dog will have genetic ties that affect
his appearance, behavior, and trainability. I outline the
major breed groups, discuss their speciﬁc characteristics,
and tell you how they might inﬂuence the attributes of a
mixed breed.
Finally, if you’re in the market for a mixed-breed dog, you
need to know where to ﬁnd one and which questions to ask
before you bring the dog home. I cover both in this part.

Mixing It Up: Introducing 
the Mixed Breed
In This Chapter
 Understanding what makes a dog a mixed breed
 Recognizing that size doesn’t matter — a dog is a dog
 Remembering that your dog — no matter his mix — wants to be your best
friend
T
he offspring of purebred dogs all look alike on the outside, and
have similar personalities and temperaments. You can’t say
that about mixed-breed dogs. No two are exactly alike — even
those from the same litter. Although their environment has a lot 
of impact on their future behavior, they still have specific genetic
codes that are difficult to decipher.
Mixed-breed dogs — especially so-called “designer dogs” — 
have recently experienced a surge in popularity. Though actually
hybrids — the offspring of two purebreds — designer dogs are
highly prized for their unique characteristics. Designer dogs are
very expensive, because they’re in short supply and highly desired.
Very small mixed breeds have also become very popular. They’re
easy to transport, can be carried in a handbag, and offer all the
affection and playful antics of their larger cousins. From 3 to 7
pounds, so-called “pocket dogs” are gaining ground, probably
fueled by the fact that they’re carried by their celebrity owners
down the red carpet. Many of the current, popular pocket dogs 
are hybrids — the mix of two very small purebred dogs.
Most dogs — regardless of their breed or size — merely want to be
with their human companions. Your dog looks to you for direction,
companionship, food, shelter, and understanding. In return, your
dog offers friendship, trust, and love. He’ll never grow up and
move away, he’s there when you need someone to talk to, and he’s

always ready to join in a game. Your dog doesn’t have to be pure-
bred to fulfill your needs. After all, your dog doesn’t know what
purebred is — all he knows is that he wants to be with you.
A Mutt by Any Other Name:
Defining Mixed Breeds
A mixed-breed dog is one who has been conceived by two different
purebred or mixed-breed dogs. The parentage of many mixed-breed
dogs is unknown, because the breeding wasn’t planned. Two
unsterilized dogs crossed paths when the female was in heat, 
and the rest is history.
Mixed-breed dogs are alternatively called mutts, mongrels, or
Heinz 57 dogs. No matter what they’ve been called, they aren’t the
sought-after purebred dog that people pay a lot of money to buy.
Mixed breeds aren’t recognized by the American Kennel Club
(AKC) and cannot compete in AKC-sanctioned shows. They’re
often frowned upon by purebred dog enthusiasts, who see mixed
breeds as a dilution of the breed.
However, in recent years, mixed-breed dogs have become more
popular. Not only are there now official clubs and events for mixed-
breed dogs, but the AKC has allowed them to participate in its
Canine Good Citizen certification tests (see Chapter 19). They’re
being put to work as service dogs, therapy dogs, and search-and-
rescue dogs. They’re valued as pets and companions. In some
parts of the world, owning a mixed-breed dog is considered chic.
Each mixed-breed dog is unique. Even designer dogs don’t meet
any specific standard, such as those seen in purebred dogs.
There’s no guarantee of the adult dog’s height, appearance, or 
temperament. What happens happens.
Although some designer-dog breeders claim that their mixed-breed
pups are healthier due to breeding two different breeds together,
this isn’t always the case. The health of the pups depends on the
two individuals who are mixed. Only through careful testing of the
parents — such as X-raying hip joints, testing the eyes and heart,
testing blood for specific diseases, and temperament testing for
overall personality — that a breeder can be somewhat certain that
the offspring will be healthy. Although most professional purebred
dog breeders do these tests, few designer-dog breeders do so. And
you can be sure that the owners of those wandering pets who
crossed paths didn’t do so either.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
10

A designer dog is a dog whose parents were both purebred dogs, of
different breeds. For example, a Golden Doodle has one parent who
is a purebred Golden Retriever, and another parent who is a pure-
bred Poodle. His mother may have been the Poodle, and his father
may have been the Golden Retriever — or vice versa. The designer
dog was bred intentionally by a designer-dog breeder. A non-
designer mixed-breed dog is a dog who was bred either intentionally
or by accident. One or both of his parents were not purebred dogs.
Even though you have no idea what your mixed-breed puppy will
grow up to look like, there are ways to be sure he’ll still be a good
pet. Your good care, training, and love will make him the ideal com-
panion. It doesn’t matter what others might think when they see
your short-legged, long-backed, droopy-eared, multicolored dog
with the overshot jaw and wrinkled forehead. All that matters is
your love and devotion to him, which he’ll return tenfold.
A Tale of Two Dogs: How Mixed-
Breed Dogs Come to Be
The story of mixed-breed dogs is often a sad one. Many people 
see them as a lower caste of animal — with no heritage and an
unknown future. They overpopulate animal shelters and humane
societies. They roam the streets in cities, suburbs, and rural areas,
menacing wildlife and small pets. In their search for food, they raid
garbage cans and alleyways. If captured by animal control, few are
claimed, and most are put to sleep.
Chapter 1: Mixing It Up: Introducing the Mixed Breed 11
How to tell where your dog came from
The best way to figure out the breeds that make up your mixed-breed dog is to look
through an encyclopedia of purebred dogs. Most mixed breeds have some appear-
ance or personality that resembles one of the parent breeds. Often, you just have to look
at color, coat type, or size to have a vague idea of which section to look in. For exam-
ple, if the dog is large, has a beauty mark on the cheek, and has upright ears, there’s a
good chance he’s part Shepherd. If the dog is small, with long silky fur and a short nose,
there’s a good chance she’s part of some Toy dog breed, likely some Pekingese.
Make a list of your dog’s attributes. Compare them to those you see in the encyclo-
pedia of purebred dogs or head to Chapter 3, where you can find an overview of the
different breed groups. When you have a fairly good idea of your mixed-breed dog’s
genetics, read more about those breeds to learn about their behavior, temperament,
and health-related issues. Doing so will help you know your dog even better than
you already do!

Just as people throw out old computers, or clothing that’s no longer
in style, mixed-breed dogs often suffer the same consequences
when their owners no longer want to be bothered to care for them.
The most common scenarios:
 Someone falls in love with a mixed-breed pup, but quickly
tires of the pup as he grows and develops behavioral prob-
lems (because the person treated him more like a toy, than 
a dog). Broken toys are thrown away; mixed-breed dogs are
abandoned in the streets or at local animal shelters.
 Someone wants to let her children experience the wonders 
of birth. How great is it to watch puppies being born and 
nursing! How cute the puppies are as they crawl around!
Seeing the pups’ eyes open for the first time, watching them
eat solid food for the first time, and watching them play with
each other — what could be better? But when the pups’
mother no longer cares for them, the task of feeding and
cleaning up after the puppies falls on the adult in the house.
And if homes can’t be found for the pups, they’re abandoned.
 A dog just gets loose. The dog’s owner tried to keep him 
contained, but where there’s a will, there’s a way, especially if
the air is carrying the odor of a female dog in season, which
many male dogs can detect from more than a mile away. It’s
not unheard of for a male dog to climb a high fence to escape
or boldly run through an invisible fence’s electronic field.
An unhappy dog without companionship will do what he can to get
loose and find company. Dogs who are tethered outdoors break their
ropes; those in pens dig under the fence; many in yards jump over 
a fence or take advantage of open gates because they want to find
other dogs. And when they find other dogs, they often procreate —
and then more unwanted mixed breeds enter the world.
Rarely does breeding of mixed-breed dogs happen intentionally.
Though unplanned, many mixed-breed dogs can still bring joy and
love to your life. Don’t judge the dog on how he came to be, or
where he was found — instead, consider how happy and fulfilling 
a future shared with that mixed-breed dog can be!
Even Toy Dogs Aren’t Toys
“Mommy, Daddy, can I have a dog?”
Many families give in to their little one’s wishes without thinking
long and hard about it first. And many other people give a friend or
loved one a dog for a holiday or birthday gift — not knowing
whether the person really wants the dog or is prepared to care for
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
12

him. Unfortunately a good percentage of these “gifts” end up at the
local animal shelters just a few months down the road — much like
a toy that no longer works or isn’t played with anymore.
Dogs take work. Yes, they’re adorable — as puppies and adults —
but putting time and energy into the care of your dog is essential if
you want a happy, healthy companion. Think seriously about how
much time you have to give before you commit to getting a puppy
or adult dog. If you can’t give a dog proper care, you’ll do yourself
and the dog a favor by not bringing him home.
Proper care goes hand in hand with overall health and well-being.
In Part II, I let you know how to give your mixed-breed dog a good
home, feed him correctly, groom him, and exercise him. A healthy
dog is less likely to develop health and behavioral issues. Bottom
line: If you take good care of your dog physically, he’s less likely to
develop the kinds of behavioral problems that result in many dogs
ending up in shelters, without homes.
Training is essential for every dog — big or small. A trained dog is
happier, easier to live with, and more accepting of new situations.
If all dogs were trained as puppies, the animal shelters wouldn’t be
nearly as full. In Part IV, I guide you through the training process,
as well as help you understand the special problems that can
occur in mixed-breed dogs. As your dog ages, he’ll have special
needs. In Part IV, I also discuss how to recognize signs of age-
related behavioral changes, possible physical changes, and when
the right time may be to let him go.
Any kind of dog can be a valued family member. What you get from
your dog is entirely dependent on what you put into the relationship.
They Don’t Call ’Em Man’s 
Best Friend for Nothin’
Wondering what you can do with a mixed-breed dog? Anything!
You may not be able to compete in purebred dog club shows, but
similar certificate-awarding shows are available for mixed-breed
dogs. You and your dog are teammates in all performance activi-
ties. Your mixed breed can
 Participate in obedience trials. These are tests of your dogs’
response to obedience commands. See Chapter 16 for more
information.
 Participate in agility. Not only does this challenge your dog
physically, but also tests how well you communicate with him
while in action. See Chapter 16 for more information.
Chapter 1: Mixing It Up: Introducing the Mixed Breed 13

 Compete in flyball. This is a relay team event with four
dogs/handlers per team. The dogs run down a lane to fetch 
a ball and return. The fastest team wins.
 Take the Canine Good Citizen test. This test is a way of test-
ing your dog’s obedience and temperament in public. (It’s not
a competition.)
 Work as a therapy dog. Your mixed breed can bring joy to
others by going to nursing homes, hospitals, and care centers.
 Work as a service dog. Service dogs perform important tasks
for those who are unable to. They are guiding eyes for the
blind, ears for the deaf, and hands for those without.
 Assist with search-and-rescue operations. Search-and-rescue
dogs find lost people and save their lives.
In Chapter 17, I explain how to travel with your dog. I fill you in on
preparing for your trip and help you make sure your dog is safe,
secure, and relaxed during the trip, whether you’re traveling by
plane, train, or automobile. Because many dogs get stressed — or
homesick — while traveling, I let you know what to do to help your
dog become a traveling gent.
Mixed breeds can perform jobs to help people, save people, 
and inspire people. They’re stars on the screen, stage, and televi-
sion. They’re heroes in the line of duty or while sifting through
debris. They keep our borders safe, sniffing out dangerous chemi-
cals and drugs.
Many mixed breeds have a bad start, but you can change that by
adopting one that steals your heart. Just one stroll through an
animal shelter or humane society, and you’re bound to find one, 
or two, who’ll give you the love and devotion you’re looking for.
They don’t call dogs man’s best friend for nothing. Nobody can
love you like a dog.

Mother’s Mutt
In This Chapter
 Hearing the hype about hybrids
 Identifying the pros and cons of hybrid dogs
 Looking at the most popular designer dogs
W
hat do James Gandolfini, Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman,
and Jake Gyllenhaal have in common? No, they haven’t all
won Oscars. They all have Puggles — the designer-dog hybrid of a
Pug and a Beagle? Designer dogs are growing in popularity, and
they’re often more expensive than purebred pups. Why? Because
they’re unique.
So why would someone pay upwards of $1,500 for a mixed-breed
dog when he can go to the local animal shelter and adopt one for
$30? Aren’t all mixed-breed dogs unique in their own ways? Yes —
but not all mixed-breed dogs purposely designed. Not all mixed-
breed dogs have pedigreed parents. Not all mixed-breed dogs have
a well-documented lineage. Designer dogs are carefully chosen to
create a specific appearance and temperament in the offspring.
The puppies are calculated, created, and planned. Most mixed-
breed dogs are accidents — but there’s nothing accidental about a
designer dog, and many people are willing to pay more to get one.
Designer dogs are not without controversy, though. Purebred dog
fanciers (a fancy name for people who are enthusiastic about dogs)
are vehemently opposed to mixing their purebred dogs with any
other breed. In this chapter, I fill you in on the pros and cons of
designer dogs, so you can decide for yourself whether they’re right
for you. I also let you know which designer dogs are the most pop-
ular, and tell you a bit about those hybrids and what you can
expect if you get one.

The Pros and Cons of Designer Dogs
Although breeders of designer dogs feel they’re meeting the needs
of a particular niche of people, purebred breeders and purebred
dog clubs, such as the American Kennel Club, think the entire
trend is dangerous to all dogs. In the following sections, I offer up
both sides of the debate and let you make up your own mind.
The pros
One of the advantages of designer dogs is the sheer number of
varieties available. Over 200 different hybrid combinations exist,
which means there is a designer dog for every taste. Most of these
hybrids are small and designed to have good personality combined
with adorability.
Designer dogs are created to fit every need — from pocket-size dogs
for easy travel to low-shed dogs for those with allergies. Many of
these designer-dog creations are free of some of the traits that can
make life difficult for the purebred dog. For example, some pure-
breds, like the Pug, have a very short snout, making breathing diffi-
cult. But the popular Puggle — the hybrid of a Pug and a Beagle —
has a longer nose while still maintaining the Pug’s wrinkled forehead
and loopy gait.
Many hybrid breeders claim their dogs have hybrid vigor, a
strength that comes from having parents of two different breeds.
The offspring of two different breeds rarely inherit genetic defects,
because the bloodlines aren’t as close as those of purebreds.
Purebred dogs often have inherited traits that can cause genetic
defects. For example, many retriever breeds tend to have cataracts
or epilepsy, many large-breed dogs have hip dysplasia, and many
small-breed dogs are prone to dental problems. Mixed-breed dogs
rarely inherit these genetic defects, because their genetics are
more varied. (Incidentally, this is true of all mixed-breed dogs, not
just designer dogs or hybrids.)
The cons
The major con of designer dogs is the price. Most designer dogs
cost upwards of $700, whereas many purebred dogs begin at $250.
Although each designer dog was bred for specific appearance 
and traits, there’s a good chance that some or all of them will not
develop in the offspring. Mixing breeds is chancy, because the out-
come is not absolute. Although purebred dog offspring will always
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
16

mature to appear like the parent dogs, the hybrid offspring may
appear more like one parent than the other, or have a personality
more like one parent than the other. So, although you might be
searching for a small Yorkipoo, the pup might grow up to be the
size of a large Yorkshire Terrier instead of a Teacup Poodle.
As much as the breeders of designer dogs claim that mixing two
breeds improves the offspring’s overall health, that fact is debatable.
Although many of the puppies don’t show symptoms of the reces-
sive genetic dysfunctions commonly seen in purebred dogs, many
other puppies do. In fact, a hybrid puppy can have the poor luck to
inherit the worst physical and temperament traits of both parents.
There are no guarantees when you get a dog — purebred, hybrid,
or mutt.
The Major “Labels” in the
Designer-Dog World
In the following sections, I introduce you to some of the most 
popular designer dogs.
I can’t cover all 200+ varieties of designer dogs in this chapter. 
But if you’re curious about the wide variety of designer dogs avail-
able, a great resource is the American Canine Hybrid Club (www.
achclub.com).
Oodles of Poodles
Few hybrids are more popular than those with a Poodle parent. 
In fact, it was the Poodle mixture that started the entire fad of
designer dogs, beginning with the Labradoodle and Cockapoo.
Poodles bring many great attributes into the hybrid crossing, 
plus they come in four sizes: Standard, Miniature, Toy, and Teacup
(a size not currently recognized by the AKC). Plus, they’re low- 
to no-shed dogs with dirt-resistant coats. When combined with a
Retriever, or other straight soft-coated breed, they can produce 
a beautiful wavy or large-curl coat that’s very attractive.
The smaller Poodle breeds also tend to live a long time. So instead 
of having a dog for only 10 to 12 years, you’ll have one who will live
upwards of 15 years. That, alone, makes a Poodle mix very attractive.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 17

When compared to other purebred dogs, Poodles are rated high on
the intelligence scale. They learn quickly and can work their way
through problems faster than most other breeds. What’s not to like
about fast housetraining? Poodles are sensitive, highly aware, and
learn by watching others.
Unless very poorly bred, Poodles have few genetic defects, though
they aren’t totally without health concerns. Their hips are far
better than most retriever and shepherd breeds. They aren’t prone
to heart problems seen in many types of dogs. And they rarely
have epilepsy, retinal atrophy, or allergies. Overall, mixing any
purebred dog with a Poodle will create great offspring.
Labradoodles (Labrador Retriever/Poodle)
Created as the ultimate service dog, Labradoodles (see Figure 2-1)
quickly became popular around the world. Just as the Labrador
Retriever is the most popular purebred dog in the United States,
the Labradoodle is also the most popular, large designer dog.
Initially, Labradoodles were bred to aid people who needed service
dogs, but were allergic to dog dander and fur. Labradoodles are
large, solid, strong, and intelligent. They’re eager to learn and love
to please their human companions. As with the purebred Labrador
service dogs, Labradoodles can work all day without tiring. And
they’re very loving. Labradoodles are ideal with children.
Labradoodles don’t interact well with assertive people or domi-
nant dogs. Any heavy-handed training technique, such as being
yelled at or jerked around on a leash, will cause a Labradoodle to
shut down and want to crawl into a corner.
Figure 2-1: Labradoodles have three coat types, two of which 
do shed.

Goldendoodles (Golden Retriever/Poodle)
Goldendoodles (see Figure 2-2) turn an already perfect family pet
into a perfect family pet that sheds less. The mixing of the Golden
Retriever and Poodle changes little about the offspring other than
coat appearance. The majority of Goldendoodles have coats with
golden hue, the structure generally similar to that of the retriever.
But the coat changes from a long and smooth, sometimes wavy 
texture, to a scruffier, curlier, harsher texture.
Golden Retrievers are the ideal dog — they love to please their
human companions, play ball, cuddle, play ball, go for long walks,
play ball, fetch a stick in the water, or if you’re feeling like you want
to play fetch for hours, fetch the ball in the water. They’re easy to
train and easy to care for.
They’re energetic and playful outdoors and happy to rest at your
feet or join in a quiet game indoors. Many will bark to let you know
of visitors, though they don’t believe in strangers — after all,
anyone can throw a ball.
Cockapoos (Cocker Spaniel/Poodle)
In Cockapoos (see Figure 2-3), generally the Poodle is the sire
(father), and the Cocker Spaniel is the dam (mother). Adult
Cockapoos mature from 10 to 30 pounds depending on the size 
of the parents (mainly the size of the sire) and the gender of the
puppy. Their coat grows very long and sheds very little, if at all.
Cockapoos require grooming every two to four months depending
on the desired length of hair. This hybrid is excellent for families
with allergies or asthma. They come in a variety of colors: buff,
red, chocolate, black, white, and a variety of parti-colors.
Figure 2-2: Goldendoodles are a great 
combination of two great family dogs.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 19

Figure 2-3: Cockapoos are great medium-sized dogs that 
shed very little, love to cuddle, and learn quickly.
Cockapoos are very patient and tolerant with children, and
because they like to play and are durable, children like them. 
They may bark to alert you of intruders, but they rarely go beyond
making noise — especially once the person is allowed inside.
Some Cockapoos can be very sensitive because both parent
breeds have a tendency toward having their feelings hurt very
easily. This is a great hybrid for the elderly, because Cockapoos 
are gentle, cuddly, and easy to care for.
Schnoodles (Miniature Schnauzer/Poodle)
Schnoodles (see Figure 2-4) are very loyal to their families. This
hybrid is affectionate, extremely intelligent, easily trained, clever,
friendly, fun loving, and loaded with personality! However, because
they are half Schnauzer, they can also be willful, stubborn, and prone
to excessive barking. Most Schnoodles are good with children and
get along fine with other animals. They’re great watchdogs because
they let you know when someone is near, but they aren’t aggressive.
This great companion dog excels in obedience, agility, and flyball.
They make excellent therapy dogs. Schnoodles are loyal and loving
companions. They’re comfortable in any environment — from an
apartment to a farm — as long as they’re with their families.
Schnoodles are high-energy dogs outdoors, but they’re happy to
warm your feet indoors. Because neither of the parent breeds —
Poodle and Miniature Schnauzer — shed, the Schnoodle does not
shed. This hybrid is easily maintained through weekly brushing
and bimonthly clipping.

Figure 2-4: Schnoodles are medium-sized dogs with 
loads of personality.
Teripoos (Terrier/Poodle)
A Terripoo (see Figure 2-5) is any Terrier breed mixed with a
Poodle. Because there are so many Terrier breeds, there are
numerous types of Teripoos.
Figure 2-5: The Teripoo can learn to work as a therapy dog.
Although most Terripoos benefit from having Poodle blood, they’re
still part Terrier, which means they have a stubborn streak, tend to
be willful, and are prone to excessive barking and overall control-
ling personalities. However, you can’t ignore their adorable appear-
ance and intelligence.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 21

Peke-a-poos (Pekingese/Poodle)
Peke-a-poos (see Figure 2-6) are small dogs, often Toy-size, weigh-
ing from 9 to 20 pounds. Their coats are usually white or gray, but
some are brown. The texture of the coat is very soft.
Peke-a-poos are fairly low maintenance with few of the common
health problems associated with the Pekingese. However, because
they are half Pekingese, they can have breathing difficulties
common with the shortened nose. The other problem associated
with a Peke-a-poo is tearing of the eyes, which can become a seri-
ous problem if the eyes become swollen or the tear stains are dark.
Peke-a-poos tend to inherit their parent Pekingese’s long, soft fur.
Unless you want to brush your dog daily, keep your Peke-a-poo’s fur
short, because a Peke-a-poo’s fur mats into dreadlocks very easily.
Peke-a-poos love to cuddle and have a medium energy level,
making them ideal dogs for small homes and apartment living.
They love to play outside for a short period of time, then sleep on
your lap for a long period of time. Though very affectionate, they
can be quite willful and stubborn, making housetraining difficult.
Figure 2-6: Peke-a-poos are lap 
potatoes, much like one of their 
parent breeds, the Pekingese.
A basket of Toys
There are more combinations of Toy hybrids than there are recog-
nized purebred Toy breeds. Though small, they’re still dogs and
should be treated as such — not as mere arm ornaments. Toy
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
22

hybrids tend to have good longevity, great personalities, and
require the special care accorded to Toy dogs.
So-called pocket dogs are usually a combination of two Toy breeds;
the parents chosen more for their small size than anything else.
The mixing of two Terrier-type Toys can mean a challenging 
personality. Also, the combining of two breeds that already have
the tendency toward similar health issues, such as breathing diffi-
culties or skin allergies, will likely result in puppies who have to
contend with these same issues throughout their lives.
Bichon Frise hybrids
The Bichon Frise is a small, white, curly-coated dog with an anti-
allergenic coat. They require a lot of exercise and consistent train-
ing. Bichons are cute and cuddly, but also like to be in charge. Any
Bichon Frise hybrid may tend to inherit these qualities, especially
if one of the parents is a Terrier-type breed.
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes more than 25 Bichon
Frise hybrids, ranging from the Griffichon (Bichon Frise/Brussels
Griffon) to the Cock-a-Chon (Bichon Frise/Cocker Spaniel). To get
the full list, go to www.achclub.com.
Pug hybrids
Pugs are a popular breed for Toy hybrid dogs because they’re
fairly hardy, sweet, intelligent, and have a short, easy-care coat.
For large-dog enthusiasts, the Pug offers the appearance of a
Mastiff (their ancestors) without the enormous size.
Pugs do have a few physical issues, however, because they’ve been
bred to have extremely short noses, which cause many respiratory
problems, and their legs are known to have problems with knee
dislocation. Plus, this breed can be willful and stubborn.
One of the biggest dangers of using Pugs in designer hybrid Toys 
is their eye configuration (they have protruding eyes) and short
noses. Breeding them with other Toys with similar physical attrib-
utes can cause dangerous health issues.
Though Pugs are Toy dogs, they have a very ingrained alarm
system. For hundreds of years they have alerted their human com-
panions of coming danger, often saving the lives of those in their
communities. If your hybrid Toy has Pug blood, you can be sure
he’ll bark when he hears intruders!
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes more than 20 Pug
hybrids, ranging from the Pugland (Pug/Westie) to the Puggle
(Beagle/Pug), currently the most popular designer dog. To get the
full list, go to www.achclub.com.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 23

Maltese hybrids
Though very small, Maltese have large personalities. They’re bold,
are quick to sound the alarm when they hear something, and can 
be difficult to housetrain. Some can be snappy with children or with
human companions who are inconsistent with their leadership role.
These small white dogs have long, silky fur and can grow to be 8 
to 10 inches tall at the shoulder, weighing about 9 pounds. They
have large, round eyes with dark rims, black noses, and a fine bone
structure. Their bodies are slightly longer than they are tall, as is
common with many Toy breeds.
The Maltese may be small, but should not be overly pampered.
Pampering makes them jealous of others, causing aggressive reac-
tions. These traits are very possible in the hybrid offspring.
Maltese are prone to sunburn on their skin, respiratory problems
due to their very short noses, eye irritation due to their somewhat
bulging eyes, and tooth problems, a common Toy dog malady.
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes nearly a dozen
Maltese hybrids, ranging from the Mauzer (Maltese/Miniature
Schnauzer) to the Silkese (Maltese/Silky Terrier). To get the full
list, go to www.achclub.com.
Pekingese hybrids
Pekingese have long, straight coats with profuse feathering. They
come in all colors and grow to about 9 inches tall at the shoulder,
weighing 8 to 10 pounds. One of the reasons for their popularity
among hybrid dog breeders is that many Pekingese can be found 
at under 6 inches in height and weighing under 6 pounds, creating
a great parent base for a pocket-size dog.
This Toy dog tends to have a broad head with wide-set dark eyes, 
a wrinkled short muzzle, and drooping heart-shaped ears with long
feathering. Their necks are short and thick. Like the Pug, they have
a rolling gait.
Pekingese are very brave, independent, and affectionate with their
own people but wary of strangers. They can be obstinate, willful,
and finicky. Due to their sensitivity to sound and movement, they
tend to be excessive barkers.
This Toy breed tends to catch colds easily and is prone to herniated
disks, dislocated kneecaps, trichaiasis (eyelashes growing inward,
toward the eyeballs), and breathing problems due to their short-
ened snouts. Heart problems are also a common health issue in
Pekingese. As with many other Toy breeds, they have a tendency to
easily become overweight so should never be fed a high-calorie diet.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
24

The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes numerous Pekingese
hybrids, ranging from the Foxingese (Pekingese/Toy Fox Terrier) to
the Yorkinese (Pekingese/Yorkshire Terrier). To get the full list, go
to www.achclub.com.
Shih Tzu hybrids
Though Shih Tzus look like Lhasa Apsos, their personalities are
totally the opposite. Where Lhasas are dominant and willful, Shih
Tzus are gentle, easy-going, and very willing to learn. They’re
happy, hardy, and have loads of character. It’s no wonder that 
this is a popular addition to many hybrid dog combinations.
They grow up to 11 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh about 9
pounds, though they do have a tendency to become overweight
because they’re very food oriented. They have round heads, short
noses, and lots of fur around their faces. Shih Tzus have long, soft
overcoats with a woolly undercoat, making them fairly hardy in
extreme temperatures for short periods of time. Their tails curl
over their backs, and they come in a huge variety of colors.
Because of their short noses, they wheeze and snore, along with
having respiratory problems from time to time. They can have
spinal disc disease due to their long back and short legs. However,
compared to many Toy breeds, their genetic defects are few.
Though it has been done, Shi Tzus should not be bred with other
dogs who have similarly short noses and large bulging eyes. This
can create some horrendous health issues with the hybrid pups.
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes more than 25 Shih
Tzu hybrids, ranging from the Fo-Tzu (Shih Tzu/Toy Fox Terrier) 
to the Bea-Tzu (Beagle/Shih Tzu). To get the full list, go to www.
achclub.com.
Pomeranian hybrids
Pomeranians resemble foxes, only with thicker, fluffier fur. Their
wedge-shaped heads; straight, triangular ears; and pointed noses
are fox-like, as are their babydoll faces. Poms have dark, almond-
shaped eyes and a double coat, which can be any solid color, though
there are some that are parti-colored, such as black and white.
Descended from Nordic breeds bred to withstand extremely cold
temperatures and work all day pulling sleds, Pomeranians are
some of the hardiest of the Toy breeds. Poms aren’t big enough to
pull a sled (though if you put about ten of them together, they’d
give it a good try), but they still believe they’re big, tough dogs.
This makes them willful, bold, and often temperamental — though
not stupid. If you use a positive training technique with lots of
incentive, your Pom will do whatever you want.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 25

Pomeranians are a popular parent breed for hybrid dogs because
they offer the beautiful fluffy coat, distinct facial features, and
small size. The average Pom doesn’t grow much larger than 12
inches tall at the shoulder and weighs a mere 7 pounds.
Though Pomeranians are tough little dogs, they do have a genetic
tendency toward specific health issues, including luxating patella
(the kneecap slips out of its proper groove and moves against the
thighbone), heart and skin problems, as well as eye infections.
Also, as with most Toy breeds, they are prone to dental problems
and weight gain.
Because Pomeranians have large, bulging eyes and the tendency
toward specific health problems, they should not be bred with
breeds that have similar attributes.
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes more than 25
Pomeranian hybrids, ranging from the Pom-Coton (Pomeranian/
Coton de Teluar) to the Poshies (Pomeranian/Shetland Sheepdog).
To get the full list, go to www.achclub.com.
Yorkshire Terrier hybrids
Yorkies are very small toys with a long silky coat that falls straight
down on either side. Although the puppies are usually black and
tan, they mature to steel gray and gold. This breed has a flat head,
medium-length muzzle, black nose, and upright V-shaped ears.
This is another Toy dog who doesn’t have a small personality —
they are Terriers, after all. As tenacious as they come, Yorkshire
Terriers have a high energy level, are aggressive with strangers and
other dogs, are demanding of attention, and are territorial. Yorkies
are often spoiled and catered to due to their small size (a mere 7
inches tall at the shoulder, and hardly ever more than 7 pounds).
This coddling creates a mini-monster. Yorkshire Terriers, as with
dogs of any size, need structure and leadership.
Yorkies do have some genetic health problems. These include
abnormal skull formations, paralysis of the hindquarters caused 
by herniated discs, and other spinal problems. They are also prone
to dental abnormalities and excessive tooth decay. They have a
poor tolerance to anesthetics and a tendency toward congenital
liver disease.
The American Canine Hybrid Club recognizes more than 15
Yorkshire Terrier hybrids, ranging from the Fourche Terrier 
(West Highland White Terrier/Yorkshire Terrier) to the Snorkie
(Miniature Schnauzer/Yorkshire Terrier). To get the full list, go

Intelligent perceptions: 
Border Collie hybrids
People who want to create a hybrid based on intelligence and not
coat type will often use the Border Collie breed as one of the par-
ents. One of the positive outcomes of using Border Collies in a
hybrid crossing is that they have few genetic health problems.
Borador (Border Collie/Labrador Retriever)
The Borador (see Figure 2-7) is often medium to large with large
feet, a long muzzle, and light brown eyes; some have upright ears.
The coat can be either medium length or short with any combina-
tion of colors ranging from all yellow to all black or with typical
Border Collie white around the neck, on the paws, and on the nose.
Figure 2-7: Here’s a typical Borador. You can see both 
breeds very clearly in this dog.
These two breeds complement each other well. Where the Border
Collie might be overly sensitive, the Labrador Retriever is bold.
Where a Lab may not be able to figure something out, the Border
Collie puts in reason. Where a Border Collie might constantly want
to chase farm animals and round them up, the Lab feels more
relaxed about work, more likely to wait for the cues from his
human companions instead of striking out to work on his own.
In all, Boradors are easy to care for, easy to train, friendly, and
often very healthy. They’re wonderful companions.
Chapter 2: Designer Dogs: Not Your Mother’s Mutt 27

Bordernese (Bernese Mountain Dog/Border Collie)
A Bordernese (see Figure 2-8) appears much like a Border Collie
only larger. The coloring of the coat is similar with black and white,
sometimes tan eyebrows. The coat texture is also similar; long,
smooth, and thick. Both breeds have long muzzles, dark eyes, 
and long tails with a slight upward curve.
Figure 2-8: The Bordernese looks very much 
like a larger Border Collie with the added tan 
highlights over the eyes.
Both breeds were developed as herding dogs. Therefore, both are
very intelligent and easy to train. The difference in temperament
lies in the Border Collie being a higher-energy worker than the
Bernese Mountain Dog and also far more sensitive. Border Collies
generally don’t interact well with children, whereas the Bernese
Mountain Dog adores children.
Mixing these two breeds together creates a larger herding dog with
a medium energy level and fairly outgoing personality. However,
Bernese Mountain Dogs don’t have the same longevity of a Border
Collie, so the hybrid offspring may not either. Another issue with
mixing these two breeds together is that both are prone to the
same genetic defects such as hip and elbow dysplasia, eye prob-
lems, and heart problems. Border Collies also might have horren-
dous allergic reactions to flea bites, as well as epilepsy. The hybrid
offspring are highly likely to not have good hybrid vigor.

A Little of This, a Little of That:
Deciding Which Mixed Breed
Is Right for You
In This Chapter
 Discovering whether you’re ready for a dog
 Looking at the different breeds
 Considering age and gender
B
ringing a dog into your home is a big deal. Sure, they’re all
adorable and hard to resist. But before you fall for those
puppy-dog eyes, you need to ask yourself some serious questions:
Am I ready for a dog? Which dog is the right one for me? Do I 
want a puppy or an adult dog? Male or female? Big or small? In this
chapter, you discover the answers to all these questions and more.
Asking Yourself the Right Questions
Before you can start thinking about which dog you want, you need
to ask yourself whether you’re ready to even have a dog in the first
place. A dog is a commitment.
There are several very important questions you need to ask your-
self. If you can honestly answer yes to all of them, then a mixed-
breed dog is right for you and your family.
Do you have enough time for a dog?
Notice I asked this question first? Being a dog guardian isn’t just
about playing with your dog when you want to — it’s about caring
for him 24/7, walking him, feeding him, grooming him, training him,
making sure he gets the right veterinary care. A dog is not a piece

of furniture to be cast aside when you get too involved in your
busy life. He’s a living, needy, interactive, sentient being who
craves your companionship. Unless you’re able to give a dog all
the time he needs, you shouldn’t get one.
Do you have enough money for a dog?
Adoption fees generally range from $40 to $100. A designer dog can
cost anywhere from $1,000 to $6,000! But the actual amount it takes
to walk out the door with a dog in your arms is not the bulk of what
your dog will cost. You also need to consider daily, monthly, and
yearly expenses of dog ownership. You’ll need to buy food, bed-
ding, and toys. A small dog may be easy to handle at only $5 per
week in kibble, but what if he requires a special diet? Many dogs
have food allergies or physical ailments, requiring prescription
diets; these can run upwards of $20 per week, depending on the
size of your mixed breed. Obviously, the larger and/or more active
the dog, the more food he’ll need to eat.
You’ll need to pay to have your dog groomed; the more you can do
yourself, the less it’ll cost, but if you send your dog to a profes-
sional groomer, you’ll be paying anywhere from $25 to $300 (per
visit) for the service.
You may decide to enroll your dog in obedience classes or other
training; basic training lessons can cost anywhere from $60 for a
set of group classes to more than $3,000 for boarding and training.
And you’ll need to see a vet at least once a year — more if your
dog gets sick or is injured. A quick trip to the vet is rarely less 
than $50; it normally costs well over $100 just for the checkup and
yearly vaccinations. Plus, there are the monthly expenses of para-
site control, at about $25 per month. As your dog gets older or is
injured, there are the costs of medications to consider. Some med-
ical treatments can range into thousands of dollars.
Are you ready to give 
your heart to a dog?
Let’s say that you do have the time and money for a mixed-breed
dog. Are you ready to love one? There’s far more to having a dog
than merely taking care of his needs. The emotional attachments
will affect you for a lifetime. Along with all the fun you have, there
will also be stress and sadness. Are you ready to fill your heart
with love, only to suffer the eventual heartbreak of loss 10 or 12
years down the road when your dog dies?
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
30

Even though the pain of losing a dog is awful, all the years of fun
and joy you have with your dog are worth it — as long as you know
what you’re getting into. If the idea of losing a pet you love is too
much for you to bear, you’re better off not getting one.
Looking at the Different Breeds
Each dog breed was developed for specific tasks — guarding, 
herding, hunting, hand-warming — and these breeds are grouped
together by their original purpose. A mixed breed is a combination
of two or more breeds. Understanding the appearance and person-
ality of the various breed groups will help you understand your
own dog, and will also be useful if you’re thinking about which 
type of mixed breed to get.
On the hunt: The Sporting Group
Sporting dogs were bred to aid hunters in locating, retrieving, and
flushing game. They can track, chase, freeze, and return with the
prize. Two of the most popular dogs in the United States — the
Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever (see Figure 3-1) —
belong to this group. Sporting dogs make great hunting compan-
ions and fantastic pets; and they’re great with active families. They
need a lot of exercise and stimulation (see Chapter 9 for more on
how much exercise the Sporting Group needs).
Figure 3-1: The ever-popular Golden Retriever is just one example 
of dogs in the Sporting Group.
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 31

The AKC recognizes 26 breeds in the Sporting Group. The most
popular breeds in this group — and the ones most often seen in
mixed-breed dogs — include: Brittany, Chesapeake Bay Retriever,
Cocker Spaniel, English Setter, English Springer Spaniel, German
Shorthaired Pointer, Golden Retriever, Irish Setter, Labrador
Retriever, Pointer, Vizsla, and Weimaraner.
Sporting dogs vary from medium to large — 25 to 90 pounds,
depending on the breed. All of them have ears that fold over. The
retrievers have webbed feet to aid in swimming and also have
quick-dry coats. The Setters have medium-length coats with feath-
ering on their legs and tails. Spaniels have fuller coats, also with
feathering on their legs and tails. Though many of the Spaniel and
Pointer breeds have cropped tails, they’re born with long ones.
Sporting dogs are athletic, high energy, intelligent, and hard work-
ing. They need a job; if they don’t have a job, they’ll drive you
crazy trying to find one for themselves. They love to sniff out game
trails, single mindedly tracking until they find the source. If there’s
something to get wet in, even a mud puddle, you can be sure
they’ll find it — and you won’t be able to keep them out of it.
All the breeds in the Sporting Group are easily trained and thrive
on structure.
Ain’t nothin’ but a hound 
dog: The Hound Group
Though the Hound Group, which according to the AKC is made up
of 23 different breeds, includes some of the first breeds ever devel-
oped to aid hunters, they aren’t the type to point, flush, or retrieve
(see the Sporting Group). Instead, Hound dogs track scents. They’re
single-minded when it comes to locating their targeted prey.
Hounds are divided into two categories: those who hunt by scent
and those who hunt by sight (called sighthounds).
The most common hounds, and those often found within mixed-
breed dogs, are the American Foxhound, Bassett Hound, Beagle
(see Figure 3-2), Dachshund, English Foxhound, Greyhound,
Norwegian Elkhound, Rhodesian Ridgeback, and several types of
Coonhounds. Except for the Greyhound, these are all scent
hounds; tracking through odor left on the ground.
Many Hounds have long, silky ears; long muzzles; and large rib
cages. Some have predominantly short coats, while a few, such as
the Afghan Hound, have long coats that require a lot of maintenance.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
32

Figure 3-2: The Beagle is one of the more popular 
Hound breeds found in mixed-breed dogs. Don’t let 
his cute looks fool you — he’s stubborn and can be 
hard to train.
Most of the breeds within the Hound Group tend to be stubborn,
single-minded, and difficult to train unless properly motivated.
Sighthounds (like the Greyhound) are generally energetic; the
slightest movement catches their attention.
While occasionally aggressive on the hunt, Hounds are rarely
aggressive to people, but they will try your patience.
Workin’ like a dog: The 
Working Group
The AKC recognizes 25 breeds in the Working Group. Most of the
dogs in this group are large, bold, and hardy (see Figure 3-3). They
were bred to work long hours though not all of them have high
energy levels. Working dogs guard, pull heavy loads, herd and, in
recent years, search and rescue.
Because most of them are very popular as pets, they’re often seen
within mixed-breed dogs. The most popular breeds in this group 
are the Alaskan Malamute, Boxer, Doberman Pinscher, Great Dane,
Rottweiler, and Siberian Husky. Though less popular, the Akita,
Mastiff, and Saint Bernard are also found within many mixed breeds.
Working dogs are large boned, strong bodied, and strong willed.
Many were bred to withstand extreme weather conditions, such 
as Arctic temperatures or the cold of Northern Europe.
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 33

Figure 3-3: The Bernese Mountain Dog is not commonly 
seen in mixed breeds, but he is a great representation of 
the Working Group.
Working dogs have extreme intelligence and steadfast working
ethics. They are hardy, often energetic, and make great pets as 
long as they’re given appropriate guidance. Some of these breeds
were bred to fight other dogs or protect people, so they have the
instinct to dominate in many situations and can be very territorial.
Working breeds do not do well if left alone for long periods of time
or tied up. This might lead to aggressive and destructive behavior.
A mix containing any of these breeds must have regular obedience
training and maintain strict scheduling. Otherwise, the dog
believes he’s the boss of your household — and you really don’t
want to deal with a large, powerful dog who thinks he’s in charge.
On the other hand, given a job to perform, Working breeds put
their entire hearts into their work. They want approval from their
human guardians, but the activity alone is positive reinforcement.
Tenacious terriers: The Terrier Group
The AKC recognizes 27 breeds in the Terrier Group. Terriers are
small-game hunters. Due to their genetic disposition to go after 
difficult game, they’re tenacious and single-minded while working;
though their work is usually protecting their household and all
those in it, while telling everyone what to do and how to do it.
The most common Terrier breeds seen within mixed-breed dogs
are the Airedale Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Jack Russell Terrier (now
called the Parson Russell Terrier), Miniature Schnauzer,
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
34

Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the Pit-Bull Terrier (not a recognized AKC
breed, but still a popular pet and recognized by the United Kennel
Club), Scottish Terrier, and West Highland White Terrier.
Most of the terriers are medium to small in stature (see Figure 3-4).
Their coats are generally short and smooth or wiry and rough,
with the exception of the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Sealyham
Terrier, and Skye Terrier, all of whom have longer, silkier coats than
the other Terrier breeds.
Figure 3-4: The Border Terrier is not commonly found in mixed-
breed dogs, but they’re similar in size and coat to dogs such as 
the Cairn Terrier and Norwich Terrier.
There’s really no structural norm among the Terrier breeds. Their
common threads lie more in personality. However, the taller of the
Terriers — Airedale Terrier and Kerry Blue Terrier — do have
some structural similarities in their long muzzles, foldover ears,
long necks, and long legs. The American Staffordshire Terrier and
Bull Terrier have large egg-shaped heads and very muscular bodies
with short smooth coats. The Scottish, Cairn, West Highland White,
Norfolk, Norwich, Australian, and Border Terriers have short legs,
long bodies, medium to long muzzles, and sharp high-set eyes,
with short to medium-length tails. All these breeds also have a
wiry, medium-length coat.
Terriers are high energy, rebellious to authority, and more aggres-
sive than any other breed group. When riled up, they don’t readily
back down. However, they do learn quickly as long as they’re prop-
erly motivated. Terriers require consistent training and guidance
every day of the week, every week of the year. Terriers are easily
excited, turning from upset-to-see-you-go to attacking the nearest
creature they see because they were upset-to-see-you-go.
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 35

The last thing you ever show a Terrier is that you are apprehensive
or hesitant. This is all they need to fully dominate you in every 
way — from how they prefer to be touched to possessive aggres-
sion and worse.
Although these dominant tendencies don’t occur in all Terriers, 
or in all mixed-breed dogs with Terrier heritage, carefully observe
your own dog for these behaviors and deal with them accordingly;
with obedience training.
Big personalities in small 
packages: The Toy Group
The AKC includes 21 breeds in the Toy Group. Toy breeds were 
initially developed from the major breed groups. Their parentage
was chosen from the smallest of the lines, eventually forming the
Toy breeds of today. Though they are their own individual breeds,
they retain much of their genetic heritage from the breeds from
which they were derived.
Toy dogs quickly adapt to any living environment. This makes
them especially great traveling companions and pets for those who
live in condominiums, apartments, or other community housing.
Yet, they also do well living in a suburban neighborhood or in a
rural setting, as long as they’re kept primarily indoors when you’re
not with them.
The Toy Group consists of the following popular breeds that are
very likely to be part of a mixed-breed dog’s heritage: Chihuahua,
Maltese, Miniature and Toy Poodle, Pekingese, Pomeranian, Pug
(see Figure 3-5), Shih Tzu, and Yorkshire Terrier.
Rarely is a Toy breed larger than 14 inches tall at the shoulder. 
They also usually weigh less than 20 pounds. Being small is what
constitutes the Toy dog label. Other than these attributes, however,
they come in all shapes, fur lengths, and personalities. Some are
very sensitive to weather conditions, and others are fairly hardy.
Some can be easy to maintain, and others are time-consuming.
Big things come in small packages. Though small in stature, Toy
breeds have big personalities. If you train and guide your Toy
mixed breed, he’ll be a tiny gem — fun, loving, and loyal.
Despite their small size, they need to be treated just like bigger
dogs — not like windup toys. They’re still dogs, and they have the
same need for structure and understanding of their environment.

36

Figure 3-5: The Pug is a key component in the 
super-popular mixed-breed Puggle, a mix of the 
Pug and Poodle. Any breed that’s part Poodle 
should inherit the Poodle’s good nature, 
intelligence, and longevity.
All shapes and sizes: The 
Non-Sporting Group
The Non-Sporting Group includes 17 different breeds, in every
shape and size imaginable, from the Standard Poodle to the
Bulldog to the Dalmatian to the Chow Chow. Non-Sporting dogs 
are big, small, wide, and narrow. All are somehow related to other
known breeds, though genetically specialized for specific jobs.
The most popular breed in this group, and the most likely to
appear in a designer dog, is the Standard Poodle. The reasons for
this dog’s popularity in the designer-dog set are numerous: They’re
intelligent, loving, and energetic. They have great longevity. They
can be almost any color, though black, white, and chocolate are
the most common — and they don’t shed.
Other popular breeds found in mixed-breed dogs include the
American Eskimo Dog, Bichon Frise (see Figure 3-6), Boston Terrier,
Bulldog, Chinese Shar-Pei, Chow Chow, Dalmatian, and Lhasa Apso.
Brachiocephalic facial structure is a dog’s muzzle that has been
specially bred to be very short to nearly nonexistent. Though this
was initially done to improve the working ability of these dogs, it
rarely has any purpose other than for appearance. Dogs who have
this facial structure include Pugs, Shi Tzu, Pekingese, Boston
Terriers, and Bulldogs.
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 37

Figure 3-6: The Bichon Frise is a popular 
Non-Sporting Dog, with a happy and playful 
personality.
Other than the Standard Poodle, Non-Sporting dogs are bold, 
challenging, and independent. They require lots of exercise and
structured guidance through training and consistency.
The Standard Poodle has lots of energy but is easy to guide in the
right direction. They have a high desire to work and love training
challenges. Essentially, Poodles can learn anything and do any-
thing, making them ideal dogs for designer-dog combinations.
They overcome many of the behavioral and structural shortcom-
ings of those breeds mixed with them.
Round ’em up: The Herding Group
There are 18 dogs in the Herding Group. And these dogs not only
round ’em up, but also push ’em along. They were bred to help
shepherds and farmers, working long hard days in all types of
weather. Because they were bred to work independently as well 
as in close sync with their handlers, many Herding breeds are
extremely intelligent.
The most common breeds within the Herding Group, and those
most likely to be found within a mixed-breed dog, are the Australian
Cattle Dog, Australian Shepherd (see Figure 3-7), Border Collie,
Cardigan Welsh Corgi, Collie, German Shepherd Dog, Old English
Sheepdog, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and Shetland Sheepdog.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
38

Figure 3-7: The Australian Shepherd is a 
classic Herding dog, and is commonly found in 
mixed breeds.
The breeds within the Herding Group range from those with short
legs (like the Corgis) to those with long, lithe legs (like the Collie).
Though none of these breeds has a short coat, several have thick
medium coats, and most tend toward long fur, making them appear
more like the animals they were bred to control.
Herding dogs have high energy. They can run an entire day and
make you tired just watching. Herding dogs are on their best
behavior if they’re allowed to exercise a lot. They’re even better 
if they receive consistent training on a daily basis — in fact, they
thrive on it. Because these dogs were bred to work hard and long
hours, they need the outlet that training activities provide.
Herding breeds tend to learn complicated tasks faster than any
other breed, making them ideal for agility, obedience, herding, and
many other occupations. They aren’t great breeds to have around
small children, because they will chase moving objects and purpose-
fully bump into them as a means of gathering the flock together.
However, they’re wonderful pets for people with active lifestyles.
Considering Age: Puppy or Adult?
When you’ve decided that you want a dog, you’ll have to figure 
out whether you’d prefer a puppy or an adult dog. This question is
especially important if you want a mixed breed, because so many
of the great mixed-breed dogs who are out there in shelters, look-
ing for a good home, are beyond puppyhood.
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 39

When you first started thinking about getting a dog, you may have
been leaning toward a puppy. After all, how can anyone resist that
fabulous puppy breath, those cute rolly-polly bodies, big inquisi-
tive eyes, playful personalities, and openness to learning. Those
attributes are their main attraction. In fact, if puppies weren’t so
cute, they might not be worth the trouble!
Puppies need to eat more often than adult dogs, need to potty more
often, and tend to be destructive because they don’t yet know the
rules (or forget them quickly) and because they’re going through
teething between 3 and 9 months of age. They take more of your
time, cost more in veterinary bills (for all their initial vaccinations
and neutering/spaying), and hurt when they bite and scratch.
Adult dogs may not have that puppy cute factor, but they don’t
require as much from you either. If you get an adult dog, she may
already be housetrained; if not, you can housetrain her easily,
because she can hold it longer. They eat fewer times throughout
the day. They’re over the teething stages so they’re less likely to be
destructive. Adult dogs aren’t as active as youngsters; an adult dog
will become a foot warmer far faster than a pup who would rather
chew on your feet.
If you’re afraid that an adult dog will have trouble bonding to you,
remember that regardless of the age of your mixed-breed dog, he
will bond with you. It’s just a matter of time.
Not every adult dog will be a great new pet, however. Many have
been abused or neglected, and that can have a huge bearing on
their current attitudes and behaviors. Although some dogs end up
in shelters and rescue groups because of unforeseen circumstances
(like an owner dying), most are given up due to behavioral issues. 
If you adopt an adult mixed-breed dog, you’ll need to commit to
hours of training and observation to cure bad habits (like destruc-
tive chewing, house soiling, excessive barking, and aggression) and
create positive new ones.
All behavior problems are curable. Some may take longer than
others, but there are always ways to solve them (see Chapter 12).
Puppies usually arrive open minded and fresh to new experiences.
This doesn’t mean they may not already have bad habits. If you’re
adopting from a shelter, your pup is bound to have had something
happen that has already formed his personality. However, if you’re
buying a designer dog, this is less likely, because a careful breeder
will give the puppies a good start on life — offering positive treat-
ment and socialization in a safe environment.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
40

There are pros and cons to a dog at any age. Every mixed breed is
his own combination of genetics and experiences, so you don’t
have any guarantees in appearance or personality. Ultimately, you
need to choose based on how much time you have and what age
you’re most interested in.
Before you go to a breeder’s house to look at all the cute puppies,
spend an hour or two hanging out at your local humane society or
animal shelter, playing with all the adult dogs that are looking for a
home. That way, you’ll see how great dogs can be at any age, and
you’ll make the decision that’s right for you.
Gender Bender: Male or Female?
Gender can play a big part in a dog’s personality and size.
Male dogs tend to be larger with bigger heads, bodies, and feet than
their female counterparts. Male dogs are usually more territorial,
which means they need to potty more often and cover the scent of
visiting dogs as well. This tendency also makes them more difficult
to housetrain.
Female dogs learn faster and are generally more loyal. Although
many female dogs are territorial, they usually mark the spot in one
pass. Female dogs are more likely to want to stay home, preferring
to stay in their safe territories instead of always looking to expand it.
Male dogs tend to be more dominant than female dogs. Male dogs
also tend to carry a stronger body odor than female dogs. But 
the gender most likely to be a good foot warmer is the male dog,
because he’s better at relaxing when the time comes. Female dogs
are always on the alert for any possibilities. Because female dogs
have the mothering instinct, most of their behavioral tendencies
are to feed, protect, and nurture their young. Thus, they’re always
aware of everything going on around them.
Adding It Up: The Right 
Dog for You
Big, small. Short hair, long hair. Male, female. There are so many
choices — how can you possibly know the right dog for you? If
you’re stymied by it all, here are a few suggestions based on where
you live and what your lifestyle is like:
Chapter 3: Deciding Which Mixed Breed Is Right for You 41

 If you live in an apartment or condominium: Try a small
female dog, maybe with Toy or Terrier breeding.
 If yours is a single-family home with very young children:
Try a small to medium male or female dog. Sporting dogs do
well with youngsters, as do some of the Hound dogs such as
Beagles.
 If yours is a single-family home with older children, or no
children: Try a medium to large male or female Sporting,
Hound, Herding, Non-Sporting, or Toy mix. Sighthounds (such
as Greyhounds) aren’t recommended because older children
have a tendency to leave doors and gates open, and
sighthounds can’t be trusted not to run.
 If you live in a country or rural setting: Try any size female
dog of any heritage. Herding and Sporting breeds will defi-
nitely thrive in this setting. Remember: If unneutered, male
dogs may have a tendency to wander, which can be deadly,
especially in a country or rural setting. (For more on why you
should spay or neuter your dog, see Chapter 18.)
These aren’t rules — they’re just suggestions. Each dog is an 
individual with genetics that are distinctly his own. Much of a 
dog’s personality rests with the training and quality of the care 
you give. Your best bet is to take the time to temperament-test 
(see Chapter 4) any dog you’re considering, and take an educated
plunge into mixed-breed dog ownership.

 Testing a dog’s temperament before you bring her home
W
ith the exception of designer dogs, mixed-breed dogs are far
easier to find than purebred dogs, because there are more of
them available. In this chapter, I fill you in on where to look.
When you decide on where you’ll get your mixed breed, you need
to know which questions to ask and how to determine if a specific
dog is right for you. I arm you with a list of questions and a series
of simple tests you can do with any dog to see if she’ll be a good fit
in your home.
Finding Your Very Own 
Mixed-Breed Dog
So many places, so little time. Mixed-breed dogs are everywhere!
You’ll find them in your local newspaper’s classified section, on 
ads posted at pet shops and grocery stores, at animal shelters and
humane societies. If you like surfing the Web, you’ll find them there
as well. In the following sections, I give you all the details you need.
Breeders
If you’re searching for a designer puppy, finding a breeder is 
the best first choice. The best way to locate a breeder is either
through your local newspaper’s classifieds section or on the
Internet. Based on my observation, accidental breeders (people

who didn’t intend to breed their dog) are most likely to advertise
in the newspaper, whereas designer-dog breeders are most likely
to have Web sites. This is just a general rule, though — as with any
rule, there are exceptions, which is why you need to know what to
look for in any breeder, no matter where you found him.
Whether you’re talking to a designer-dog breeder, or an accidental
breeder of a non-designer mix, here’s a list of questions to ask:
 Was this litter planned? If so, it’s more likely that your pup
will be healthy because the breeder wants to produce good-
quality pups.
 How long have you been breeding dogs? If the breeder says
that the breeding wasn’t intended, it’s likely that his dog got
loose and was bred by the neighborhood Casanova. If the
breeder tells you that he’s been doing it for several years,
there’s a good chance he is knowledgeable about the process.
 If the litter was planned, how did you choose the parentage
for this litter? The breeder should relate the good genetic
background of the parentage (for example, good health and
temperament).
 If the litter was planned, what types of health screens were
done on the parent dogs? A responsible breeder will have the
parents’ hips, eyes, and heart checked for abnormalities.
 Can you give me the names and phone numbers of people
who have bought puppies from you in the past? A good
breeder will be proud of his puppy placements. References
shouldn’t be a problem.
 What do you look for in a potential puppy purchaser? A 
concerned breeder wants the best homes for his pups.
 Can you give me a copy of the pup’s health records? All
pups should get their first worming at 5 weeks, another at 7
weeks, and their first vaccines at 7 weeks.
 What are the puppies being fed? If they’re receiving a good-
quality food (see Chapter 7), the breeder cares about giving
the pups a good start.
If and when you actually visit the home of the breeder, ask yourself
the following questions:
 Is the odor overwhelmingly bad, tolerable, or nonexistent?
You want your puppy to come from a place that’s clean, so the
less offensive the odor, the better.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
44

 Where are the puppies being contained? If they’re inside the
breeder’s home, they’re likely to get lots of early socialization,
which is very important to their future behavioral develop-
ment. If they’re outside in a kennel, or merely with the mother,
who is tied up outside, the pups probably never received
proper handling or care.
 How big is the operation? Is this the breeder’s profession? If
so, the kennel may be large, but should not contain more than
two different types of hybrid mixes.
 Do you see external parasites (such as fleas, flea eggs, ticks,
and mange) on the puppies? If the pups are kept outdoors in
unsanitary conditions, they’ll probably have one or more
external parasites along with some internal ones.
With all the money to be made on designer dogs, lots of breeders
are popping up claiming to have designer puppies, without giving
any thought to the backgrounds of the parents. Many of these
breeders have become puppy mills, merely churning out pups
without regard to the welfare of the animals.
Shelters
Animal shelters (including humane societies) are great places to
find a mixed-breed dog. If you get a dog from a shelter, you’re help-
ing in many ways. You’ll be saving a life. Plus, your adoption fees
go toward helping other homeless pets.
Getting a dog from a shelter does carry some risk — you may be
bringing home a dog who’s sick. But the rewards outweigh the risk.
(To minimize your risk, be sure to ask questions — see “Knowing
Which Questions to Ask,” later in this chapter.)
Rescue groups
Most rescue groups are dedicated to specific breeds, but they
often take in dogs who are mixes of the breed they work with.
Other rescue groups take in dogs of any breed.
The best place to locate a rescue group is through the Internet.
Most rescue groups and humane societies tend to advertise their
adoptable dogs on Petfinder.com. The AKC also has a page on its
Web site that lists breed-specific rescue organizations (www.akc.
org/breeds/rescue.cfm).
Chapter 4: Choosing Your New Best Friend 45

Knowing Which Questions to Ask
When you’ve found a dog you’re interested in, your work has only
just begun. You need to ask questions (either of the breeder, the
shelter workers, or the rescue-group guardians) so that your deci-
sion is a rational one, not one based on how adorable the dog is.
Here’s a list of questions to start with:
 What breeds are part of the dog’s makeup? The breeds that
are part of the dog’s family tree will give you a better idea of
what to expect in terms of personality, size, and other attrib-
utes. (See Chapter 3 for more on all this.) The dog’s current
guardian may not be able to recognize every breed, but she
should be able to give you an educated guess.
 Which vaccinations has the dog received? Has the dog been
neutered or spayed? Is the dog receiving heartworm and flea
preventative? Some shelters, such as those in rural areas, don’t
have the funds to handle these health issues, whereas most
rescue groups make certain that these things are immediately
handled upon the dog’s acceptance into their group.
 What is the dog’s personality like? How about her social
skills? If the dog you’re considering has been in a foster home
for a while, the current guardian should be aware of the dog’s
overall behavior patterns.
 How much exercise does she currently get? Is it enough to
keep her satisfied?
 What is her behavior like when she’s in the house? Does she
live harmoniously with other dogs or cats?
 How does she do when walking on a leash?
 Has she learned any obedience commands? If so, what are
they? Be sure to ask how to perform those commands with
her if you decide to adopt the dog.
 What is the dog eating? Does it agree with her? The best way
of checking this is to ask whether her feces are solid (they
should be) and medium to dark brown in color; that her weight
is normal; and that she has bright eyes and a healthy coat.
 What are the dog’s feeding and relief schedules?
 Where is the dog comfortable sleeping? In a crate? In a pen?
In the bedroom? Somewhere else?
You need to find out as much as possible about this dog, so don’t
be afraid to ask. In fact, the dog’s current guardians will be more
likely to accept you as the dog’s new guardian if you ask the right
questions with a genuine interest in the answers.

Matchmaker, Matchmaker, Make
Me a Match: Temperament Testing
When you’ve found a dog you think is right for you, you’ll want to
do what’s known as temperament testing. Temperament testing is
just what it sounds like — a way to test the dog’s temperament and
be sure she’s right for you and your home. It informs you of the
dog’s overall personality — how she prefers to be touched, what
frightens her, how she feels about being a family member, and
whether or not she’ll want to share her toys. It will also give you
some insight into what her strengths may be (such as enjoying a
game of retrieving or having strong herding ability).
There are five general tests you can perform with your potential
new dog prior to bringing her into your life. I cover all of them in
the following sections.
Be gentle: Testing for 
touch sensitivity
This test lets you know whether a dog has any special sensitivities
in specific areas, as well as how she feels about being touched in 
a dominant manner. It’s also a great way to break the ice, because
most dogs adore being touched and will quickly become great
friends with those who offer it.
Here’s how to test a dog for touch sensitivity:
1. Begin by petting the dog: Rub the top of her head, her
back, and then her chest and tummy.
Most dogs, even overly excited ones, will calm slightly
when getting a belly rub.
Progress slowly while petting a fearful dog. Be patient if 
she moves away and allow her to approach you. Some dogs
aren’t familiar with being touched in certain areas such as
their ears, tail, legs, or feet.
2. When the dog has accepted touch on her upper body, move
your hands down her legs: Lift her feet (see Figure 4-1),
touching her paws and toenails.
Here are some possible reactions you may see:
• The dog growls. If the dog growls, stop all temperament
testing and move on to another dog. She may be injured
or ill; ask her current guardian if the dog has shown any
symptoms.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your New Best Friend 47

• The dog moves away, growling. A dog who moves away
while growling may be aggressive and unsocialized.
Don’t force yourself on this dog — she might display
fear aggression. Give her the opportunity to return to
you without force. She may be injured or ill; again, ask
the dog’s current guardian if she’s shown any symptoms.
• The dog cringes but allows you to touch her. A dog
who allows you to touch her but cringes may be friendly
but also may have been abused at some point in her life.
She would do well in a quiet home with adult guardians
who have lots of patience and time for her.
• The dog allows touch, but doesn’t react. A dog who
allows you to touch her but doesn’t react may be ill or
traumatized. It’s highly unlikely that she won’t respond
to some form of touch — dogs love being massaged and
touched, especially on their backs, chest, and tummies.
Look closely for a sly grin — you may have missed it.
• The dog allows touch and responds by moving closer.
A dog who moves closer as you touch will be a great
candidate for most environments except for being left
alone for long periods of time. This is also a dog who
might display separation anxiety because she has a
great need for pack unity. She’ll likely work out well in a
busy family home where there are family members who
would like to include him in their activities.
Figure 4-1: Lift the dog’s feet and touch her paws and toenails to see how 
sensitive she is.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
48

What’s that? Testing for movement
and object sensitivity
Some dogs enjoy new sights and sounds; others get nervous in the
same situation. Dogs raised in loving homes or with a conscien-
tious breeder will likely be more inquisitive than frightened at
seeing something new rolling around, while a dog who hasn’t 
had exposure to new things, or had some bad experiences, might
become frightened and move away.
This test helps you understand a dog’s reaction to new things and
moving objects. Here’s how to do it:
1. Collect several objects, such as a ball, squeaky toy, and
bone. Have a baking pan, car keys, and a heavy book 
on hand.
2. Lay all the objects on the floor and allow the dog to 
investigate (see Figure 4-2).
Figure 4-2: Be sure to include a variety of objects to see how the dog responds.
Here are some possible reactions you may see:
• The dog moves away: A dog who moves away is very
fearful of new things. Unless you’re very patient and live
in a quiet household, you shouldn’t adopt this dog.
• The dog has no reaction: If the dog doesn’t react, she’s
indifferent to new things — or at least to these new
things. If you have very young children or elderly 
parents living with you, this dog may be ideal.
• The dog starts to investigate but stops and moves
away: A dog who starts to investigate but moves away
will take time to acclimate to new situations.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your New Best Friend 49

• The dog investigates the objects: The dog who investi-
gates the objects is inquisitive but not bold. She’ll do
well in most any home.
• The dog investigates and interacts with the objects: The
dog who investigates and interacts is confident. She’ll do
well in a home with children and an active lifestyle.
3. One at a time, pick up all the objects and roll them across
the floor, observing the dog’s reactions as you do.
Begin with the object least likely to cause a reaction, such
as a ball. Then try a bone, a squeaky toy, and car keys.
Finish by dropping a pan or book.
Some possible reactions that you may see include the 
following:
• The dog moves away: A dog who moves away is fearful
and should not be in an active home. This dog may react
fearfully when overwhelmed by new events, sights, or
sounds.
• The dog has no reaction: A dog who has no reaction is a
very accepting dog who should do well in most environ-
ments.
Most healthy dogs have some reaction, though, so 
be sure that she at least watched the movement or
responded somehow to the sound. Otherwise, you 
may want to check the dog’s health.
• The dog starts to chase but loses interest: This dog may
work out well in a quiet environment, but is unlikely to
want to play much with toys. She may like chewing a
bone, though.
• The dog chases, grabs, and carries the object away
from you: This dog is bold, possessive, yet playful. She
needs to be in a home with structure and consistency.
• The dog chases, grabs, and brings the object to you:
This dog will be ideal if you have an active family. She
loves to play, retrieve, and interact with the world.
Who’s the boss? Testing for 
dominance and submission
This test will help you gauge a dog’s dominant or submissive 
tendencies — very important to understand, because a dominant
dog may be more difficult to control.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
50

You may not see the full extent of a dog’s dominant tendencies in
her foster home, because she’s one of many brought into a tempo-
rary environment. When she develops a sense of “home,” she may
begin to become territorial. Dogs test their boundaries as they’re
settling in.
There are several ways to test for dominance. Following is a list of
all three tests.
Always begin with the least-invasive test (Step 1) and work your
way to the more difficult (Step 2 and then Step 3). If you’re at all
unsure and the dog is reacting negatively, you may want to find
another dog to bring home.
1. Pick up the dog’s front end, holding just behind the front
legs (see Figure 4-3).
Figure 4-3: Lifting the dog’s front legs is a way to test her dominance.
Possible reactions you may see in the dog include the 
following:
• The dog struggles, growls, and tries to bite or mouth
you: This reaction shows a very dominant dog. If you
Chapter 4: Choosing Your New Best Friend 51

adopt her, you must remain assertive at all times and
make sure you and she go through a lot of obedience
work.
• The dog struggles, but eventually gives in: This reac-
tion shows a bold dog, but not an overly dominant one.
She still needs an assertive household and might do
okay with older children who won’t be afraid of her if
she jumps on or chases them.
• The dog shows extreme fear and yips: This reaction
shows a very fearful dog. This dog should live in a 
quiet home where her guardians will be patient and
understanding.
I’ve seen dogs who have this reaction turn from being
fearfully submissive to being in charge of their household.
This can happen when overly permissive guardians give
the dog a lot of leeway because she seems afraid. Dogs
are smart — she may be displaying the fearful reaction
because she wants to be allowed a dominant role. The
bottom line: Let her make the first approach, but don’t 
let her run the household.
• The dog gives in readily, but moves away when
released: This reaction shows an insecure dog. This dog
just may not feel at home in her current environment.
• The dog submits and relaxes, remaining with you
when released: This reaction shows a secure dog. This
dog would likely do well in any environment, with con-
scientious children of all ages. She’ll learn quickly and
enjoy every minute with you.
If you were able to perform Step 1 without the dog showing
any aggression, and you feel comfortable with the dog,
move on to Step 2.
2. Sit and stare into the dog’s eyes. Don’t look away first.
Possible reactions you may see in the dog include the 
following:
• The dog stares back at you and growls: This reaction is
one of a very dominant dog. This is not a dog you’ll want
to live with — she’ll challenge you every chance she gets.
If she’s showing dominance at this point, you most defi-
nitely don’t want to move on to Step 3. She may just be
stressed in her current location, but you have no way of
knowing that she won’t be similarly stressed at some
point after you bring her home.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
52

• The dog stares back at you and doesn’t look away:
This reaction is still a dominant dog, but one who can
be. Doing so will take consistency and diligence, as well
as an assertive guardian who will make the dog work for
everything. This dog will be happiest in a very struc-
tured environment.
• The dog stares at you a moment and then looks away:
The dog who stares and looks away is unsure of her
position. She may be testy in specific situations, such as
when she really wants something, but she’ll easily back
down if her guardian remains assertive and insistent.
• The dog never looks you in the eye: The dog who never
looks in your eyes is very submissive and accepting.
This dog will do well in most environments.
If you were able to perform Step 2 without the dog showing
any aggression, you can give Step 3 a try. If the dog has
shown any dominance in the other tests, do not move on to
Step 3. Step 3 puts the dog in a totally submissive position
where she feels vulnerable.
3. Roll the dog over onto her back.
Possible reactions you may see include the following:
• The dog struggles, growls, and tries to bite you: This 
is the reaction of a very dominant dog. She’s not a good
candidate for anyone with children or an active home.
She will do best with a single, assertive owner who will
work with her and maintain a structured environment.
• The dog struggles but eventually gives in: This is the
reaction of a dog who has some dominant tendencies
but who understands when she’s not in charge. She’ll 
do well in a home with assertive owners, but not with
young children.
• The dog has no reaction and remains on her back with-
out any struggle: This dog will do well in any home. The
dog feels comfortable and secure in her environment.
• The dog gives in quickly, cries, and moves away when
released: The dog who gives in but cries and moves
away is very submissive and possibly fearful. She should
live in a quiet home.
• The dog gives in quickly and remains with you when
released: This dog should work well in any home, though
she should always be approached in a positive manner
and be given lots of praise for everything she does.

I’ll get that! Testing for 
possessiveness and 
retrieval ability
You want your dog to play fetch with you, so the mere fact that she
runs after the toy is a great sign. Though, you’d really appreciate
her bringing the toy back to you so you can throw it again. It’s the
give and take that makes the game.
Some dogs have the genetic tendency to play fetch following the
rules; other dogs have different ideas. Some dogs would rather just
chase the ball and take it elsewhere so that nobody else can play
with it. Other dogs think you’re nuts if you think she’s going to chase
that thing when she’d rather be sleeping or chewing on a bone.
This test will let you know which tendency is most likely in a dog.
There are two parts to this test, and I cover both in the following
sections.
Give and take
The reaction a dog has to this test will depend on the value of the
object you give and take away. For example, for some dogs, a
squeaky toy might be fun to play with, but a food-filled bone is of
higher value, and the dog may not give it up easily.
Begin this test with a toy of lesser value, such as a stick or rubber
toy, and gradually work your way toward something of higher
value, like a tasty bone.
To do this test, just give the dog the item. Then gently take the item
away, either offering another one in its place or caressing the dog
as you take the object so as not to present a threatening situation.
Possible reactions you may see in the dog include the following:
 The dog growls: This dog is possessive. This dog is certainly
not right for a family with anyone who isn’t assertive.
 The dog holds the object, but eventually gives it up: This
reaction shows a dog who is possessive but not aggressive
about it. This dog will do well in a home with assertive
owners, but not with young children.
 The dog readily gives up the object or the dog drops the
object and runs away: Dogs who have these reactions will
work well in any environment, but if the dog does run away,
her guardians need to be patient with her, because assertive-
ness may overwhelm her.
Part I: Just the Facts, Ma'am 
54

Chase and retrieve
To do this test, take one of the dog’s favorite toys, and throw it a
short distance.
Possible reactions you may see in the dog include the following:
 The dog goes after the toy, picks it up, and runs off: A dog
who runs off with the toy is possessive. She likes to chase her
toys, but she doesn’t want anyone else to share them with her.
 The dog goes after the toy, picks it up, and lays down with
it: This dog may not be in a playful mood, but definitely wants
to possess her toy.
 The dog goes after the toy, sniffs it, and turns away: This dog
doesn’t have much interest in the toy. Are you sure you chose
a favored toy? If not, try again. If you did choose her favorite
toy, this dog is one who just doesn’t like to play fetch, or who
is so stressed that playing isn’t in her current itinerary.
 The dog doesn’t go after the toy: This dog just doesn’t like
toys or doesn’t care about that particular toy. Try additional
toys until you get some response. If the dog doesn’t have any
response, the dog likely either hasn’t gotten the point of toys
or hasn’t found anything that floats her boat.
 The dog goes after the toy, picks it up, and returns it to you:
This dog is highly interactive and social. She wants to play
with you and is a natural retriever. She’ll likely do well in an
active environment with children of all ages and people who
spend lots of time with her.
Follow the leader: Testing 
for social skills
This test is important if you have other animals at home or live in
an animal-filled neighborhood. The last thing you want to deal with
is a dog who is aggressive to other dogs or wants to chase cats.
The only way you’ll be able to do this test is if the dog is currently
being housed in a facility where there are other animals. If she’s
currently in a foster home, she’s probably already acclimated to
living harmoniously with other animals so this test may not be 
necessary. But it can be useful if the dog is in a shelter or humane
society without direct contact to other animals on a regular basis.
Here’s what to do: Walk her by the kennels of the other dogs. Then
walk her in the cat area.
Chapter 4: Choosing Your New Best Friend 55

Possible reactions you may see in the dog include the following:
 The dog goes after any other dog or cat: This is a dog who
shouldn’t go into a home with other dogs or cats or into a neigh-
borhood that has many other dogs or cats in close quarters.
 The dog only goes after other aggressive animals (those
jumping, barking/meowing, or growling/hissing as she goes
by): This dog will fight if challenged. Again, not a good candi-
date in a home with other dogs or cats, or in a neighborhood
where other dogs or cats are living or walking nearby.
 The dog doesn’t show aggression, but does show an eager-
ness to say hello to a quiet dog or cat: This is a friendly dog
who should do well in any environment.
 The dog walks by with no reaction: This dog should do well
in any environment.
 The dog runs by and tries to get away from the aggressive
dogs and cats: This dog should do well in a home with other
dogs or cats, but should be introduced carefully and with as
much positive reinforcement as possible. She’s probably
never had the opportunity to socialize with other animals 
and just needs some time to acclimate.
Some dogs react negatively toward cats but love other dogs. And
believe it or not, some dogs love cats and can’t stand other dogs.
Pay close attention to how the dog reacts to dogs as well as cats —
she may be fine with one species and not the other. Do keep in
mind your neighborhood, though. For example, if you live in an
apartment complex with other dog owners, and the dog you’re
considering doesn’t like other dogs, you could run into trouble
every time you take your dog out for a walk.

and get it ready for your new best friend — everything
from removing chewing hazards to stocking up on sup-
plies to setting aside a comfy place for your dog to sleep.
When you bring your new dog into your home, you don’t
want to let her loose and see what happens. Instead, take
her on a guided tour to investigate her new digs and new
family members. In this part, I tell you how.
Your biggest challenge will be scheduling time for your
new dog. I give you all kinds of suggestions to make sure
you give your dog all the time she needs.
I also give you pointers on what to feed your new dog. 
I tell you what to look for in commercial dog foods, and
provide some recipes you can try if you want to make
your own dog food.
I tell you everything you need to know about grooming
your dog. From dental hygiene to pedicures to checking
for parasites, the information in this part will help you
keep your dog clean and healthy.
Finally, I let you know how much exercise your mixed-

lean, hide, remove, and buy. This chapter covers all the things
you need to do to prepare your home for your new mixed
breed — from getting rid of safety hazards to setting up his new
abode. If you’ve found your dog and you’re just waiting to pick him
up from the shelter or breeder, you’ve come to the right place!
Dog-Proofing Your House
Put everything away. And I mean everything! A dog who hasn’t
grown up and/or been shown how to live in a home could be into
anything that looks edible — from books and magazines, to eye-
glasses, TV remotes, telephones, and MP3 players, your dog will
see something interesting and set his teeth on it.
Your mixed-breed dog isn’t necessarily inherently destructive —
not any more than a human toddler who tests everything by put-
ting it in her mouth. He’s just investigating his environment to see
what might taste good and what’s just fun to play with.
In time, you’ll be able to get your home life back to normal, but
until your new mixed breed learns what he can and can’t play with,
be safe — and until you can trust him — you need to keep your
home dog-proofed. Not only is this better for your relationship
with your dog, but it’s less of a health hazard for him (some dogs
swallow things that can poison them or otherwise wreak serious
havoc with their insides).

In the following sections, I fill you in on the major steps you need
to take to make sure your home is safe for your new friend.
Removing chewing hazards
If your new dog is older than 2 years old, removing chewing hazards
isn’t as big of a deal. This issue is more important with young dogs,
because they’re still exploring their environment and tend to chew
anything, especially between 3 and 9 months of age (when they’re
teething). An adult dog may chew if he has separation anxiety when
you’re not nearby.
Empty your trash cans daily. They’re very enticing to a dog, espe-
cially if the trash contains discarded food. Get a covered can for
your kitchen, or place the can inside a cabinet so your dog can’t get
into the garbage. Remember: This isn’t just to prevent a mess — the
trash can include all kinds of dangerous things, like chicken bones,
batteries, plant cuttings. Even the ink on paper can be poisonous or
become clogged in your dog’s intestines.
Electrical cords are a huge hazard. Not only can a dog pull on them
and yank the appliance down on top of himself, but if he chews on
the electrical cord, he could die. Either make sure that all electrical
cords are up out of his reach, or cover them with steel conduit to
prevent him from chewing the actual cord. Keeping electrical items
unplugged when you’re not available to watch your dog is also a
good idea.
Put your poisonous houseplants (see Chapter 7 for a list) in a room
where your dog can’t get to them, or arrange them on a high
enough platform that he can’t get to them.
Many household supplies — including bleach, detergents, moth
balls, pine and citrus oils, insecticides, rat baits, antifreeze, and
batteries — are also very dangerous to your dog. Make sure that
they’re all out of reach of your dog.
Outside there are other hazards — some poisonous, others merely
destructive. Put away the garden hose, any potting supplies, lounge-
chair cushions, and children’s toys. If you have candles or small
lanterns on tables, place them in a safe area as well — especially 
citronella candles. The only things you can’t put away are your land-
scaping plants and the large patio set, though if any of the furniture
is made of wood, either put it out of reach, or cover it daily with a
product like Bitter Apple. Or you can always keep an eye on your
mixed breed when he’s outdoors and redirect him away from the 
furniture toward a toy.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
60

If you have a garden within an area available to your dog, put a
secure fence around it.
Protecting your furniture
In my house, the dogs aren’t allowed on the furniture. I’ve made
this a house rule for several reasons:
 It prevents my furniture from being destroyed by muddy paws
and sharp claws.
 It maintains my dogs’ understanding of their place in my
household. Many dogs who are allowed on the furniture feel
as though they’re superior to others (including the people in
the house) and become dominant.
 It keeps my guests from being walked over by my dogs.
 What if my dogs are used to lying on the couch and they get
sick? I’ve never wanted to have to clean vomit and diarrhea
off the upholstery.
If you’d like to keep your dog off of your furniture, and if your new
dog is a pup, have lots of nasty-tasting spray on hand to make sure
he doesn’t develop a taste for wood. Several products — such as
Bitter Apple, Fooey, Bitter Lime, and more — are readily available
at pet shops for just this purpose.
If you’re bringing an adult dog into your home, and you think he
might like jumping up on the furniture, there are things you can do
to prevent this. In fact, you may want to implement them prior to
bringing your mixed breed home so that he quickly learns that the
furniture is off limits:
 Put things in the way so that he can’t become comfortable on
the couch.
 Put a ScatMat (an electrified mat that tingles the paws when
pressed) across the furniture so that if he tries to get up, his
toes get a tingle. (They’re available in most pet stores or
through www.contech-inc.com.)
 Place some pans across the couch so that they make noise
when jostled, either chasing him off the furniture or at the
very least letting you know that he’s trying it again so you can
redirect his actions.
 Close off the room so that he can’t access the furniture that
you don’t want him jumping on.
Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Your Dog’s Arrival 61

If you’ve read all this and you’re thinking, “Hey, half the reason I’m
getting a dog is so I can curl up on the couch with him and watch
movies or read a book,” you may want to look into furniture covers
so your upholstery won’t be ruined by his claws. Or you can use a
thick throw blanket to cover the areas where you’ll allow him to
sit. You can also restrict which pieces of furniture he’s allowed up
on. Maybe you let him up on the couch in the family room, but not
on the furniture anywhere else in the house. Whatever works for
you — the important thing is to be consistent with your dog.
Pushing up daisies: Giving 
your dog a place to dig
Dogs will dig. The trick is to give your mixed breed a place where
he can dig without destroying your home or yard. If a dog doesn’t
have an opportunity to dig (or to get some other equally fun form
of exercise), he’ll search for other activities — such as chewing
your furniture, digging up the carpet, pulling up linoleum, eating
drywall, or something else along those lines.
Digging is a form of exercise for your dog. So, instead of merely let-
ting him outside to race around the yard by himself, go with him.
Play tag, play hide and seek, throw toys. If at any time he starts to
dig, redirect him into another game. As long as he stays busy and
happy, he won’t dig.
Dogs also dig to create a cool place to lie down. If it’s hot outside
and your mixed breed can’t go into a cool house, he’ll dig around
bushes and the house foundation. Offering a small wading pool
with cool water will help fulfill this need to make a comfortable
resting area. Keep the wading pool in the shade so that the water
doesn’t become too hot to be comfortable. Throw some floating
toys in the pool to make it more enticing. Better yet, go in there
with him and splash around. It’s more fun with two!
If you’d like a place to allow your mixed breed the freedom to run
and dig, partition part of your yard for this purpose.
If you have a small dog and want to set up a special play area for
him, consider using some baby gates to keep him contained within
a specific room. Put lots of toys, blankets, and a few small chil-
dren’s outdoor play toys in the room. This may sound extravagant,
but if you meet your dog’s need to dig, he’ll stay out of trouble
elsewhere.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
62

Born to run: Making sure 
your dog can’t escape
A secure yard is very important when you own a dog. If you got your
mixed breed at a shelter, it’s likely that he became a stray because
he was left in an unfenced yard and he ran away. If dogs aren’t
happy, they’ll seek other accommodations. If they’re lonely, they’ll
seek other dogs to socialize with. If they’re abused, they’ll try to
escape. If they’re bored, they’ll look for ways to occupy their time.
The best fencing is a wood privacy fence. Not only does this offer a
solid barrier, but it also keeps other dogs and pranksters from tor-
menting your dog. With this type of fence, your mixed breed is less
likely to run the fence, chasing other dogs. The height of the fence
depends on the size of your dog. A dog under 10 inches at the
shoulder should be fine with a 3-foot-high fence. A dog up to 18
inches at the shoulder should be safe with a 4-foot fence. Any dog
over 18 inches at the shoulder, especially one who can jump high,
needs a 6-foot-high fence.
Alternatives to wood privacy fences include
 Chain link: This is a good way of keeping your dog at home —
it’s just not as pretty as a nice wood fence and it doesn’t give
you and your dog the same level of privacy. The same guidelines
regarding height apply to chain link as apply to wood fencing.
 Wire mesh: This works well as long as it’s installed correctly.
Wire mesh may be less expensive than wood or chain link, but
it’s even less attractive than chain link and often not as secure.
I don’t recommend this type of fencing for anything other than
a small dog who isn’t prone to digging and jumping.
 Invisible fencing: This is great if you live in a neighborhood
with rules against fencing. It’s also good for fencing in large
areas, giving the dog lots of space to run. However, an invisible
fence doesn’t keep others out, which leaves your dog open to
attack from other dogs or people who are looking to steal him.
Dogs learn the boundaries of an invisible fence within a week
and adhere to them, though some dogs will test the collar 
batteries now and then to see if they can make a run for it.
Invisible fencing consists of a wire that’s buried 1 or 2 inches
around the boundary of your yard and attached to a transmit-
ter that maintains the boundary distance, most commonly set
at 6 to 15 feet. The dog wears a collar that beeps if he gets
within 2 feet of the set boundary. If he continues and enters
the “no zone,” he gets a mild electric stimulation. Be very
careful if you intend to use this type of fencing. Remain with
your dog until he’s aware of his boundaries and feels comfort-
able enough to use the yard.
Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Your Dog’s Arrival 63

If you don’t have the luxury of being able to fence a yard, you’ll
have to take your dog for walks on a leash. Walks aren’t a bad 
thing — they’re actually very positive, because you get to spend
lots of time with your dog. In fact, even if you have a fenced yard,
you should make an effort to walk your dog at least once a day.
This becomes a special time that your mixed breed will look 
forward to.
Many neighborhoods have fenced dog parks. These areas are great
for letting your dog freedom to play in relative safety. It also gives
him a chance to socialize with other dogs and people — a great
combination. However, some dog owners aren’t conscientious
about cleaning their dog’s mess, or teaching their dogs to not play
aggressively. Always keep a watchful eye as the dogs play and
remove your dog from any sticky situations.
Your Mixed-Breed Dog’s Bedroom
Dogs need a place to sleep where they feel safe and secure. You
have a few options, so before you bring your dog home, think
about what will work best for you and your dog.
Crate or pen? Your dog’s 
first place to sleep
Many dogs who don’t yet know the house rules will have accidents
indoors or play with something that isn’t a dog toy. Until you know
for sure that your mixed breed won’t have an accident in the house
or be destructive, contain him in a crate or pen when you’re not
around to watch him — including during the night. This will
become your dog’s private room where he can go when he wants
some peace and quiet, as well as a place for him to sleep.
Furnish the crate or pen with a bowl of water, a couple of toys, 
and a comfortable bed (see the “Bedding” section, later in this
chapter). Be sure to acclimate your dog to his bed using positive
reinforcement, teaching him that it’s a nice place to be. The crate
should never be used as a place of punishment, nor should the 
dog be imprisoned within it for long periods of time every day.
Although a crate offers the safest sleep area, a pen may work for a
dog who feels too cramped within a crate. An exercise pen consists
of eight 2-foot-wide side panels. The pen can be folded for storage,
or opened to the full extent, giving your dog 16 cubic feet of space.
If your dog likes to climb or is in any way an escape artist, a pen is
not the place to contain him, because he’ll easily climb out.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
64

Thinking outside the box: Letting your
dog sleep outside a crate or pen
Don’t let your dog sleep outside a crate or pen unless you’re
absolutely sure she won’t get into trouble when you aren’t 
watching her.
Start by keeping him in an enclosed room, such as the kitchen (if
during the day) or your bedroom with you (if at night). When your
mixed breed proves reliable with these areas, you can gradually
open up your house a little more.
Even if you’re adopting a dog with a proven housetraining back-
ground, you may still want to initially restrict him to smaller areas
of the house because dogs sometimes soil indoors when moving
into a new home.
Bedding
The type of bedding you give your dog depends largely on the situ-
ation and size of your dog. For example, a small dog can be spoiled
with one of those canopy luxury beds, while a big dog might be
most comfortable on a big pillow or hammock type dog bed.
The main consideration when shopping for a bed is ease of clean-
ing and durability. I’ve found that the beds with a structure made
of PVC pipe are the hardiest and easiest to clean — you just hose
them off. This is a great bed for indoors or out, and few dogs will
have a tendency to put their teeth to work on them.
A good bed for the crate is a pillow or mat-type bed. Look for
something thin enough to go into the washing machine, or a bed
that has a removable outer shell.
Some dogs make it a point to destroy their beds or soil on them. If
your dog falls into this category, don’t give him any bedding at all
until these tendencies go away.
If you live in an area where fleas are an issue, a cedar-filled bed will
help control the pests and protect your pet. Cedar is a natural flea
repellent and great for filling up a pillow bed, giving your dog a
comfortable place to sleep. This is great for an outdoor bed or if
your dog’s bedroom is located in the basement or a storage area.
Don’t buy your dog an expensive bed until he’s proven that he
won’t eat it or soil it. At that point you can go and get him that 
bedroom set you’ve been eyeing.
Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Your Dog’s Arrival 65

Giving Your Dog a Place to Eat
The most convenient area to feed your dog is usually the kitchen,
because the flooring is easy to clean and most people prefer to
keep food in one area of the house. Plus, your dog will like the 
consistency of knowing where he eats.
Dogs should always have access to fresh water. However, if you
want to prevent water spillage, offer your dog his water in a raised
feeder appropriate to his size. Place this in his eating area.
Stocking Up on Supplies
Ah, the fun part! You get to go on a shopping spree for your new
dog! Although it’s loads of fun to go to a huge pet-supply store, it’s
also more expensive than shopping via catalog or online. (See the
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book for some online resources.)
The basic supplies include a collar (more than one if you want 
to be stylish), a leash or two, food and water dishes, a bed (see
“Bedding,” earlier in this chapter), and toys. You may also want to
get a travel carrier (see Chapter 17), a home crate/pen, and groom-
ing supplies (see Chapter 8). Prior to bringing your new mixed
breed home, you also need to stock up on his food (see Chapter 7).
Collars and leashes
Many different types of collars and leashes are available. The type
you choose depends on your dog’s temperament and how you
intend to use the collar. If you’re using the collar to make a fashion
statement, get a separate collar for training purposes. And if you
have a training collar on your dog, be sure to remove it the
moment you’re done with the training session.
The typical buckle or snap-on collar is great for making a fashion
statement and for displaying your dog’s rabies tag, ID tag, and
license.
If you’re looking to get a training collar, there are many to choose
from. I recommend getting a head halter (Comfort Trainer and
Halti are two good brands), a Gentle Leader Easy Walk Harness
(www.gentleleader.com), or a SENSE-ation Harness (www.
softouchconcepts.com).
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
66

In terms of leashes, your dog will walk best with a 4- to 6-foot walk-
ing leash that isn’t overly heavy or difficult for you to hold. I find
that a 1⁄2-inch leather leash offers optimal comfort for both the dog
and the person — and it lasts a long time. Cotton leashes are also
generally comfortable, but not practical if your mixed breed pulls
hard. Nylon is fine for a dog who doesn’t pull at all.
Dishes and bowls
Which dishes and bowls are right for your dog depends on his size
and temperament. Here are a few things to consider:
 Size: If the dog is large, don’t get a dish that’s barely big
enough to fit his nose. Make sure he can fit his entire face in 
it as he eats his food. On the other hand, you may not want to
use a large bowl for a small dog. He’ll spend more time chas-
ing down the flying kibble than eating it. For dogs with long
ears, get a bowl that’s narrow at the top and flares out at the
bottom — this will keep his ears from getting into the food.
 Material: If your dog is likely to play with his dishes, you 
don’t want anything breakable. Ceramic is out of the question,
regardless of how heavy-duty it appears. If he’ll chew the
dishes, you don’t want plastic ones. It doesn’t matter if the
plastic is very thick — he can get his teeth into it and have 
a great time demolishing the dish. Also, some dogs develop
contact allergies (hypersensitivity to plastic).
Stainless steel dishes are my dish of choice. They last a very
long time, can’t be destroyed (even if your mixed breed has 
all sorts of games planned for his dinner dish), and are easy 
to clean.
 Elevation: Whether you put your dog’s bowls on the ground
or in an elevated feeder depends on the size of your dog and
how he eats. A small dog is fine with his dish on the floor. A
medium to large dog should have a raised feeder if he tends 
to eat quickly or likes to play in his food or water. The raised
feeder will prevent him from putting his paws in his food and
tracking it around the house.
Toys
The types of toys you should get are totally dependent on your
dog. Obviously, you want to get a toy that’s the right size for 
your dog so he can get the most use out of it — big dog, big 
toy; small dog, small toy.
Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Your Dog’s Arrival 67

Stay away from anything that can cause choking, diarrhea, or aller-
gic reactions. This means no rawhide sticks, chips, or edible toys
that contain cornstarch, wheat glutens, or chemical preservatives.
I know this rules out a lot of the things that dogs like chewing —
some of which even claim to be good for dogs’ teeth and gums —
but if you don’t want to have to take your mixed breed to the vet
for expensive allergy tests, steer clear of these items.
There are lots of interactive toys that are safe and fun for your dog.
Toys that have hollow areas to put kibble or squeeze treats (like
cheese that comes from a squeeze can) are always popular.
Small dogs may do well with plush toys that have squeakers, or
even vinyl squeaker toys. However, I don’t recommend these toys
for dogs over 25 pounds, unless the dog has proven that he won’t
shred the toy.
All dogs do well with real beef shank bones. The bones have thick
walls, and are hollow on the inside, offering a great place to stuff
food and treats. These toys last for years — they’re indestructible.
Hollow bones are great for dogs who teethe. They can be filled
with canned food, and then frozen. Give it to the dog when you
can’t watch him for an hour or two. He’ll stay busy and get some
relief for his gums.
There are lots of toys to choose from. Consider the size and tem-
perament of your mixed breed before you splurge on items that’ll
end up in the garbage or lodged in your dog’s intestines. Start out
with one toy and see how he likes it. Add additional toys over time.
And when you’ve accumulated a bunch of toys, rotate them out,
keeping some set aside in a closet or someplace where the dog
can’t get them — then rotate the toys every once in a while, and
your dog will think it’s his birthday all over again!

ringing your new dog home involves more than just leading
her through the front door. You want your dog to walk into a
loving home where every experience she has is a positive one.
In this chapter, I give you tips on introducing your new dog to the
people and animals she’ll be living with. You’ll show your mixed-
breed dog where her food, water, and bed are, as well as where 
she should go to relieve herself.
If your mixed-breed dog recently left her brothers and sisters, or a
foster home where she had become attached to someone, she’ll be
feeling mighty lonely without her special friends. In this chapter, I
let you know what to expect and how to help your dog feel safe
and comfortable in her new home.
Finally, you need to schedule time for your new mixed breed. You
need to figure out how your new family member fits into your own
busy schedule, when and where she’ll get her exercise, what times
are good for meals, and when you’ll take her out to relieve herself.
In this chapter, I offer some tips on all these topics.
Giving Your Dog the Guided Tour
You want to introduce your new mixed breed to your home — and
everything and everyone in it — in a controlled, calm, and loving

manner, from the first minute you arrive. Proper introductions will
help her settle in faster and feel secure in her new home.
Walking her in and showing 
her around
If you’re driving your mixed-breed dog home, be sure to put her 
on a leash and walk her from the vehicle to your door. This pre-
vents her from running off, especially important because she has
no idea where she is and could easily become lost (not to mention
hit by a car).
The other reason a leash is important is because you want to have
some control over where she goes after she’s inside. You want to
take each room slowly, so that your dog won’t feel overwhelmed.
Here are some basic steps to follow:
1. Walk her into a room.
2. Let her sniff around the room, still on the leash.
3. In each room, tell your dog to sit. If she doesn’t listen,
place her into position and reward her so that she learns
the meaning of the word, Sit.
4. After she sits, praise her, pet her, and give her treats.
5. Move on to the next room.
Repeat these steps until you’ve gone through every room in
your house — even rooms you plan on keeping off-limits for
your dog. This approach will help her feel more comfortable.
Dogs react to the emotions of the people around them. If you
remain calm, you’ll help your new dog feel more relaxed.
Put other family dogs outdoors when bringing in your new mixed
breed. This will prevent any territorial disputes and help your new
dog settle in faster. When she’s comfortable, allow her to meet
other four-legged family members one at a time.
Greeting the family
Everyone probably wants to be the first to greet your new dog. But
the last thing you should do is let everyone come up at once. Being
swarmed by a bunch of strangers is way too overwhelming for
your new dog. Instead, make sure that each family member has a
treat in hand and then take turns allowing the dog to come and
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
70

accept the treat. As the dog eats the treat, pet her gently on her
chest and talk to her in a happy, calm tone of voice. When your dog
is done with the first treat, repeat with the next person until every-
one in the family has had a turn. The meeting will be positive, and
the dog will learn that everyone in your family is a source of all
kinds of love and treats.
Always closely supervise children as they interact with your new
dog. They need to be taught responsible handling techniques and
that the dog should sit for them prior to giving her a treat or petting.
To a dog, being the source of treats means good things. You 
definitely get on a dog’s good side through her stomach. Gentle
massages are great, too — especially the ears, tummy, and back.
Meeting other pets
Introducing your new dog to your other pets is something you
need to put a little thought into. An unplanned introduction can 
go very badly for the new dog, as well as your other pets.
Don’t make the introductions at the same time you enter your
home with your mixed-breed dog — it could be threatening to 
the existing family pets, who may become territorial and assertive.
Keep your other animals in a safe area away from where your new
dog will be entering and exploring your home.
Do the first introductions in neutral territory. A great meeting place
is anywhere that your current pet doesn’t spend much time, some-
place where she won’t feel territorial.
Introductions to other dogs
The best way to ensure that your new mixed-breed dog will be 
welcome into a home that already has a dog or two is for you to
take your current dogs to meet the new family member prior to
bringing her home. If they do well together, then the canine wel-
coming committee will be more favorable. If not, then you know 
to not adopt that particular dog.
The best way for dogs to meet is on their own terms. This means
off leash (or if you’re unsure, allow the leash to drag) in a safely
fenced area where they can greet each other in their own way.
You’ll see lots of rear-end sniffing, nose-to-nose sniffing, posturing
(walking around stiff-legged, putting a paw over the other dog’s
shoulders, or fur raising along the spine, among other things), 
and maybe some whining, whimpering, or barking.
Chapter 6: Bringing Home Your Mixed Breed 71

Regardless of what you see, most dogs work it out well on their
own without your help. In fact, getting in the way of this initial
canine socializing can cause problems as you aren’t allowing the
dogs to do what they need to do to figure out where they stand
within the pack pecking order. After the dogs figure out where they
stand, one dog will bow down and invite the other to play. Then
they’re off and running, lifetime friends.
Here are some signs that the dogs may have some difficulty 
getting along:
 One of the dogs is snarling.
 The dogs rush at each other growling.
 Both dogs posture and try to get on top of each other.
 One of the dogs shows complete disinterest and tries to
walk away, but the other dog persistently tries to gain that
dog’s attention. This might happen if one of the dogs is very
old and has no interest in playing with another dog, but the
other dog wants very much to play. The older dog may snap
or injure the persistent younger dog. Or the younger dog may
inadvertently injure the older dog.
 The dogs stare at each other for a long time, challenging
dominance.
If you notice any of these signs, separate them immediately.
A good means of acclimating dueling dogs is to walk them together.
Initially, have one person walk one dog and another person walk
the other dog. Walk the dogs side by side, but make sure the dogs
are separated by one or both of the people. When both dogs are
paying more attention to their people than to each other, you can
bring them closer together while walking.
When the dogs can walk in the same direction together, they’ll
need to learn to pass each other. Start them at a distance where
the dogs don’t react to each other. Each time the dogs can pass
each other without reacting, bring them a little closer together 
on the next pass by.
When both dogs are working well together, they can have the 
freedom to play together in a neutral area, such as a park or down
the road from your house. However, if you’re still uncomfortable
with allowing the dogs to interact, or you see something in their
actions that is bothersome, contact a professional dog trainer or
animal behaviorist right away. It never hurts to get a second or
third opinion on the dogs’ interactions.

Introductions to cats
Introducing your new dog to a cat can be dicey — some cats won’t
be as open to greeting your new mixed-breed dog as the dog is to
saying hello, often with enthusiasm, to a running, screeching cat. 
If your mixed-breed dog believes cats are there to be chased, their
relationship will be off to a rocky start.
All meat-eating animals have a prey drive, a desire to hunt that’s
triggered by something (or many things). For dogs and cats, move-
ment is one of these triggers; scent comes in a close second. Most
dogs chase cats merely because they move (usually running away
from dogs). The dog isn’t chasing the cat because she’s hungry —
the movement merely triggers the dog’s instinctual desire to hunt.
You have to quickly let your dog know that the cat is supposed to
be a friend, not prey. In order for the dog to get the message, you
have to keep the cat still during the initial introduction. Have
someone hold your cat as you introduce your mixed-breed dog 
to her. Here’s how to hold your cat:
1. Hold her paws in your hands.
Front paws in one hand, rear paws in the other.
2. Place one arm around the cat’s haunches to control
movement of her back end. Place the other arm around
her shoulders for control of the front end.
3. Sit and keep your kitty on your lap, holding securely.
When you’re ready to introduce your new dog to your cat, follow
these steps:
1. Put your dog on a leash.
Chapter 6: Bringing Home Your Mixed Breed 73
Projecting a positive attitude
When you’re helping two dogs acclimate to each other, keep your emotions in
check. In order for the dogs to gain comfort, you need to remain passive yet posi-
tive about the situation. Your first dog will be directly affected by your emotions,
showing edginess if you’re pensive, or aggression if you’re totally scared of the two
dogs getting together. The new dog will quickly pick up on this negative energy flow-
ing from you. Keeping your thoughts — and your energy — positive will help the
two dogs acclimate to each other quickly.

2. Allow your dog to push her nose at the cat, with a 
loose leash.
As your kitty remains still, your mixed-breed dog’s prey
drive will not be initiated.
3. Offer both the dog and the cat some tasty treats.
This will make the experience of meeting each other a 
more positive one. It will give them both good associations
in each other’s presence.
Don’t let go of the cat until your mixed-breed dog begins to
lose interest and turns away. Instead of just letting go of the
cat, place her in another room. This will ensure that she
doesn’t run and trigger your dog’s prey drive.
It may take several such meetings in order to ensure that the two
creatures become friends. However long it takes, the time spent is
well worth it. Not having to separate your pets and teaching them
to be comfortable together not only gives you less to worry and
fuss about, but also gives them the chance to be companions
instead of enemies.
Feline/canine companionship rarely entails the rough play that 
you see between dogs. It’s more of a comfort level in each other’s
presence.
Taking her out to do her business
Shortly after introducing your dog to your house, your family, and
your other animals, you’ll need to show your new dog where she
should do her business.
Because your dog is new to your household, you need to go with
her to show her where to relieve herself. Just letting her out the
door might make her uncomfortable. She’s not yet familiar with the
yard and she’ll want to come back inside with you, where she may
potty on the floor — not the behavior you were looking for.
Instead, take her to her potty zone — on a leash if your yard isn’t
fenced. Have some treats with you. Wait with her as long as it takes
for her to relieve herself. Your dog has been busy with all the activi-
ties, so you can be sure she has to go. Walk around a bit with her,
allowing her to sniff. Make certain the leash is very loose at all times.
When your dog does her business, praise her enthusiastically 
and give her treats. This positive reinforcement tells the dog that
you’re happy that she relieved herself outside, in the area you
want her to do her business.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
74

Until your mixed breed is familiar with the yard, you’ll need to con-
tinually accompany her to the relief zone, giving treats the moment
she does her thing.
Many dogs, especially those new to a pack, will follow the behavior
patterns of the established pack. This helps them be accepted by
the other dogs and, even better, learn the house rules faster.
Showing the dog her sleeping area
In order to feel at home, your mixed breed will need to know where
to sleep. After all the commotion of introductions and being walked
around on the leash, she’ll be very tired. Before leaving your dog to
her own devices, show her where you’d like her to rest.
Place her bed in a quiet area, offering safe containment. This can
be an alcove with a baby gate separating it from the rest of the
house, an exercise pen, or a crate (see Chapter 10).
Prior to placing your dog in her area, put fresh water within easy
reach and include at least three toys along with a comfortable bed.
Remain with your new dog for a few minutes. Remember: You’re
her source of comfort. Show her the toys — interact with her and
the toys to increase her interest in them. Stroke her gently and
speak in a soothing tone of voice. All these things will help your
dog relax.
You’ll know you can leave her in her room when:
 She lays on her hip.
 Her head lowers.
 Her breathing is calm and slow.
Chapter 6: Bringing Home Your Mixed Breed 75
Toyland: Choosing the right toys
So many toys, so little time. You really won’t know which toys your dog likes until
you’ve tried a few of them and gauged her reaction. Some dogs merely mouth their
toys while others demolish them.
The safest bets are heavy-duty toys that you can fill with food treats — such as
sterilized hollow shank bones, Kong toys, Buster Food Cubes, and others along those
lines. A delectable toy will maintain your dog’s attention, preventing her from using
her bed or your walls as chewing outlets. Offer a variety at all times.

If she gets up when you leave (which is a possibility, because her
source of comfort is no longer nearby), don’t give in and return.
Unless you plan on always sleeping with your dog, she needs to get
used to the idea of being alone in her area. Go about your business
and don’t look at her. She’ll either turn her attention to the toys or
return to napping.
Fighting Those First-Night Blues
Being in a new place with a new family is tough, especially when
your dog may have been attached to people or other animals in her
last home. The first night in your house may be very frightening —
she’s found all kinds of new smells, new people, and new compan-
ions. It’s a lot to take in all at once. Where’s the dog she used to
cuddle with? What are all those new sounds?
It may take a day or two for your new mixed-breed dog to accli-
mate to her new home. Until then, you need to understand why
she’s unable to relax and figure out how to help her.
Whether you got your mixed-breed dog from a breeder, picked her
up from a rescue group, or adopted her from a humane society, she
was probably living with other dogs (or puppies) and had formed a
relationship with them. Dogs are pack animals, social creatures.
They want the company of other canines and they’re very lonely
when they’re separated from them. Your new mixed breed will
likely miss her former friends until she feels at home with you.
This situation can be far different if you already have another dog,
as long as the other dog has accepted your new dog and is willing
to allow her to remain nearby at night. However, if your new dog
isn’t readily accepted as part of the pack, she’ll likely pace, whine,
and scratch to get to you.
The first tendency of new dog owners is to take their anxious dog
into bed with them, thinking this is the best way to alleviate the
poor dog’s insecurity. Unless you’re planning on always doing this,
don’t. Yes, your dog might sleep better, but you’ll regret it later if
you really want her to sleep somewhere else.
Allowing your dog to sleep with you is setting a precedent for the
future. Your dog learns that whining and scratching will earn her a
place in the preferred bed. Plus, this will make her feel empowered,
in control of the family instead of merely a family member. This sit-
uation can be a dangerous one for a mixed-breed dog with domi-
nant tendencies.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
76

The first night may be difficult for both of you, but setting the
house rules early in the game will help your new dog learn her
place within your family and home. She’ll settle in faster, learn 
her role, and discover the difference between right and wrong.
Here are some things you can do to help your new mixed breed
dog settle in:
 Sit with her a while at her bed, massaging her chest, back, 
and ears.
 Keep the lights turned low, not off.
 Try to avoid sharp noises.
 Give her herbal remedies such as valerian root or chamomile
tablets an hour before bedtime to help her relax. You can find
these at nearly any store that sells vitamins.
 Flower remedies such as Equilite brand, Home Sweet Home,
or Bach Flower Rescue Remedy (see Chapter 12) are great for
helping your dog settle into her new home. You can obtain
these online or at many popular pet stores.
Before putting her to bed give her lots of exercise. A tired dog
doesn’t have the energy to stress.
Scheduling Time for Your New Dog
You got a dog to enrich your life. Your new mixed breed gives you
joy and is something you look forward to each day — and you
need to be the same for her. You have to make time for her — time
for exercise, specific feeding and relief schedules, and an educa-
tion (see Chapter 11).
When you make a schedule stick to it. Dogs are creatures of habit.
Knowledge of what’s going to occur, and when, helps your mixed
breed dog adjust to her new life quickly.
Exercise and playtime
Exercising your dog is just as important as feeding her. Set aside
time each day to play with your dog and work with her.
The amount of exercise she needs depends on her age, her breed
mix, and her personality. But you can be certain that without
enough exercise, she’ll engage in the wrong activities — both to
get your attention and to occupy her time.
Chapter 6: Bringing Home Your Mixed Breed 77

Walking along on a leash does is great exercise, especially for an
older dog, but younger dogs need more than this.
Though training exercises do stimulate your dog’s mind, and 
make her tired, they don’t totally exercise her body. Dogs need 
free play — off leash, preferably with other dogs, provided they
haven’t ever displayed any aggression to other canines.
A small dog will often get plenty of exercise racing around the
house, but that isn’t the preferred situation for a medium-sized or
large dog. Having an 80-pound dog racing around an apartment 
or even a good-sized house can be quite disruptive. More so as she
jumps over the couch, runs through the kitchen, and barrels over 
a trash can or two. Having any dog larger than 10 pounds means
lots of exercise — outside, in all types of weather.
A fenced yard will help, but your mixed-breed dog will prefer to
spend much of her exercise time interacting with you, such as
going for long walks, and playing fetch and chase games. Make
time for this.
Feeding time
Dogs need to know when they’re going to eat. Feed your mixed
breed in the same location every time so that she knows where
she’ll be eating. This will help prevent her feeling that she can eat
anywhere in your home, which can set her up for future anxiety
(see Chapter 12).
Your mixed-breed dog’s feed dish should be somewhere in the
kitchen, but not in a direct path with your cooking area. Under a
desk, at one end of a kitchen island, or at the edge of the room are
generally good places. Place the water dish near the feed dish.
Don’t place the dog’s dish near a trash can. She might think the can
is part of her meals.
Stick to a feeding schedule to help your dog know that she’ll be
taken care of at a specific time. The feeding times depend greatly
on your own work schedule, as well as the age of your mixed-
breed dog.
Let’s say you work a regular 9-to-5 job. In order to give your mixed-
breed dog time to exercise and relieve herself before and after
work, try the following scheduling:
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
78

6 a.m.
Take her to her relief zone.
6:15 a.m.
Feed her.
6:30 to 7 a.m.
Take her to her relief zone and exercise her a bit
before leaving for work.
5:30 to 6 p.m.
Take her to her relief zone.
6:15 p.m.
Feed her.
7 p.m.
Take her to her relief zone and exercise her a lot.
What about if you work irregular hours? Regardless, try to stick to
some semblance of a schedule. You may not be able to offer consis-
tent exercise times, but you do need to offer similar feeding times.
Due to their faster metabolism, young dogs need to be fed more
often than older dogs. Here’s a sample feeding schedule for a dog
under 5 months of age for someone who works the regular 9-to-5 job,
keeping in mind that there will be an opportunity for the youngster
to eat and exercise midday — whether you can come home at that
time, or have someone do it for you, it’s an important consideration
when bringing home a young dog.
6 a.m.
Take her to her relief zone.
6:15 a.m.
Feed her.
6:30 a.m.
Take her to her relief zone and exercise her a lot.
12 p.m.
Feed her.
12:15 p.m.
Take her to her relief zone and exercise her a lot.
6 p.m.
Feed her.
6:15 p.m.
Take her to her relief zone and exercise her a lot.
Dogs over 5 months of age can safely be fed twice a day, as long as
they don’t have a medical condition that requires the dog to be fed
smaller meals more often (see Chapter 14).
Potty time
Potty time goes hand in hand with feeding time, because when
your dog eats has the most bearing on when your dog needs to go
out (see the preceding section). If you want a housetrained dog,
you’ll have to adhere to a schedule. Make certain you schedule her
Chapter 6: Bringing Home Your Mixed Breed 79

potty breaks into your day or arrange to have someone available
to do it for you.
The younger the dog, the more often she’ll need to potty. This is
something to keep in mind when you choose a dog. Do you have the
time to take her to her relief zone every hour or so? If you want to
housetrain a puppy (see Chapter 10), that’s what you’ll have to do.
The more your pup exercises, the more often she’ll need to be
taken to her relief zone.
Dogs over the age of 4 months can hold themselves longer, but
they still require relief times more often than a dog over 9 months
of age. Take your 4- to 9-month-old dog out every three to four
hours to be on the safe side. After the age of 9 months, you can
wait as long as 6 hours, longer if she has to, but that wouldn’t be
kind to her on a daily basis.
Male dogs require more time to relieve themselves because they
have the tendency to urinate several times instead of letting their
bladders empty all at once. They also have to relieve themselves
more often throughout the day than most female dogs.

Chasing the Chuckwagon:
The Basics of Feeding
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of canine nutrition
 Identifying the types of food available
 Knowing what to feed your mixed-breed dog
 Looking at special diets for special dogs
 Getting tips on treats
Your mixed-breed dog needs a balanced diet for optimum phys-
ical and mental health. If you’ve been in a pet store recently,
or even just the pet-food aisle of your local grocery store, you
know how many commercial foods are available — and you may
have been overwhelmed by all the options. In this chapter, I tell
you what to look for in a dog food, based on your dog’s individual
attributes.
You don’t want to let your dog become overweight, so you need to
know how much to feed him as well as how often. If you do some
research into this subject (as if you have time!), you’ll find varying
schools of thought on this topic. I’ve read the research, but in this
chapter, I cut through all that and give you tips based on my own
experience with dogs.
As your dog ages, or if he develops allergies, you may need to
remove certain foods from your dog’s diet or add certain foods 
to it. In this chapter, I explain how to recognize these special
needs, as well as what to do to maintain your dog’s health 
through appropriate nutrition.
All dogs love treats. But you can’t give your mixed breed treats all
the time — no matter what he tells you. In this chapter, I help you
find the right times and places for treats and guide you toward the
right treats for your mixed-breed dog.

The Basics of Nutrition
Your dog has a few important needs when it comes to his nutrition.
Following is a list of guidelines to keep in mind:
 Give your dog plenty of water. Your dog needs to have 
plenty of water available at all times. Refresh your dog’s water
twice daily — don’t just wait for your dog to finish his bowl.
Puppies and their moms tend to drink more, as do working
dogs. If it’s hot out, you can bet your dog will tend to drink
more than usual.
 If you need to change your dog’s food, do so gradually. Some
dogs have very sensitive stomachs. This is why you don’t want
to feed your dog table scraps or whatever food happens to be
on sale that week. Your dog’s digestive system takes time to
adapt. Over a period of two weeks, gradually increase the
amount of the new food, and decrease the amount of his old
food, until you’re feeding only the new diet.
 Feed your dog consistently. Dogs are happiest when they
know what is going to happen and when. The number of times
a day to feed your dog depends on your dog’s age and overall
physiology. If your dog is between the ages of 3 and 5 months,
feed him three times a day. Most adult dogs do well with two
meals each day. But in some situations an adult dog may need
to be fed more often; for example, if your dog has a digestive
disorder, or a tendency to bloat, you’ll want to feed him three
or four smaller meals each day. (If you’re not sure, as always,
check with your vet.)
 Don’t free feed your dog (leave food out for him to eat
whenever he wants) — control the amount he eats. If you
control how much he eats and when, you’ll be able to control
his weight better.
Pay attention to your dog’s waistline — to be blunt, he should
have one. Dogs can develop fat rolls all over their bodies,
which not only hinders their ability to exercise but decreases
their hearts’ efficiency. Reevaluate the amount of food you
feed your dog periodically — your dog’s needs will vary as he
ages, as his activity level changes, and as his lifestyle changes.
 Feed your dog a balanced diet. I cover the kinds of foods to
find your dog in the following section.
 Make sure your dog’s food is clean and free of contami-
nants. Commercial foods are typically packed to keep contam-
inants out, but after you open the food (whether a bag or a
can), be sure to securely fasten it, refrigerate canned or raw
food, and store dry food in a dry location. After your dog has
finished a meal, if he’s left anything in his dish, throw the food
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
82

away, and clean his bowl after each meal. (You wouldn’t eat
off the same dirty plate over and over without washing it, so
why should your dog?)
 Consult your vet if your dog experiences any abnormal 
conditions. Changes in appetite, thirst, or behavioral changes
may be signs of serious health issues.
A shiny dog means a healthy dog. You’ll know you’re feeding your
mixed-breed dog correctly if he has bright eyes, and a shiny coat,
and if he maintains a good weight and energy level.
Types of Dog Food
There are more brands and variations of dog food than I can count.
You can find many of them at your local grocery store, discount
department store, or pet store. Where you buy your mixed breed’s
food doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a better (or worse) food than
any other. The only way to know for sure is to read labels.
Most store-bought dog food comes in two varieties — dry and
canned — so in this section, I go into more detail on what to look
for and what to avoid with these two types of foods.
“Wait!” you say. “What about the semi-moist variety?” You may be
tempted to go that route, thinking it’s the best of both worlds, but
here’s a serious warning: Stay away. There’s a reason that the food
is semi-moist — in a word: preservatives. If you feed your dog a
food that contains preservatives, you may as well be pumping
poison into him. Over time, preservatives affect your mixed-breed
dog’s liver, heart, and other organs. The result is organ malfunc-
tion, organ breakdown, and growth of cancerous tumors.
Commercial dog foods aren’t your only options. You can cook your
own food for your dog. Or you can prepare a raw diet for your dog,
or have one delivered to your door. Homemade and raw diets offer
many benefits, but you have to be careful with how they’re pre-
pared, stored, and given to your dog. I cover homemade and raw
diets in this section as well, to let you know what to watch for.
On the subject of being careful, I include a list of specific foods and
plants that can be poisonous to your mixed-breed dog.
Commercial dog food: Canned or dry
The brands of dog food most advertised in the media aren’t neces-
sarily the best ones for your mixed-breed dog. You can be sure,
Chapter 7: Chasing the Chuckwagon: The Basics of Feeding 83

however, that the least expensive foods are of the poorest quality,
because good quality costs more.
Pet-food labeling regulations are poor, so you’ll rarely get full dis-
closure of all the included ingredients and nutrients that a com-
mercial food contains. You also won’t know all the preservatives
either. In fact, although some foods might claim to be preservative-
free, that only means they didn’t add anything, not that they didn’t
obtain ingredients that already had the preservatives in them.
Most of the lower-quality commercial dog foods are high in grains
(such as corn, wheat, rice, and barley), which are used as fillers.
Although small amounts of rice and barley are healthy, corn and
wheat can cause allergic reactions in some dogs. Symptoms of
allergic reactions include runny eyes; dry, itchy skin; lick granulo-
mas (hot spots); and ear infections.
When reading dog-food labels look for meat proteins, vegetables,
vitamins, and as few grains as possible. The first three ingredients
should be healthy proteins — not grain, by-product, or a preserva-
tive. You should see lamb, turkey, beef, or chicken. After those first
three ingredients, you shouldn’t see more than three types of grain
within the food. Any more than three and the food is mostly grain
filler, not protein-based.
You’ll probably see meat by-products and meals in the ingredient
list. By-products are often the organs and other tissue of the protein
meats used in the foods. Digest is another popular ingredient,
especially in chicken-based foods. Chicken digest is the content of
the chicken’s stomach — often grains. Neither the by-product nor
the digest are bad for your dog, as long as the food is meat-protein-
based and low in grains and preservatives.
So what should you feed your dog? I recommend a mixture of dry
and canned. Here’s more on each of these two types of food and
why I recommend each of them:
 Dry: It’s less expensive, easy to store, and easy to feed. Many
people claim that their dogs do better on dry food than they do
on canned; the dogs have less loose stool, less gas, and better
breath. Dry foods are also good for your dog’s gums and teeth.
Dry food doesn’t spoil or attract ants as badly as canned food.
However, dry food also has very little moisture and not a lot of
flavor. It’s far more processed than canned food, which means
it has fewer vitamins and nutrients for your dog. If your dog is
at all finicky, he’ll likely turn down plain, dry food.
 Canned: Canned food is more expensive than dry food, espe-
cially the premium, holistic brands. It can sell for upwards of
$2 per can! But canned food is easy to store.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
84

Canned food is not processed as much as dry food, so it con-
tains more of the whole foods that comprise the ingredients
and fewer preservatives. This also means more vitamins,
nutrients, and flavor.
Canned food contains a lot of moisture. Dogs don’t get all
their moisture from merely drinking water — they also get it
from the foods they eat.
Both dry and canned food offer benefits to your dog. The dry food
is good for his teeth and gums, and it gives him more bulk to fill
him up. The canned food contains more of the nutrients, moisture,
and vitamins he needs to remain healthy, but it is more expensive.
To give your dog the best of both worlds, give your dog some of
each type of food at every meal.
Homemade food
If you have the time, and a couple good recipes, you can create a
healthy, balanced diet for your mixed-breed dog. You’ll need to 
mix together the correct amount of proteins, fat, carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals. Your dog requires a consistent diet, so if
you’re going to go the homemade route, be sure you’re willing to
stick with it.
If you want to give your dog a partial raw diet, add some raw veg-
etables, fruit, and supplements to your dog’s commercial diet.
Here’s a basic recipe that you can give your dog without causing
him intestinal distress:
1. Cook some turkey, beef, chicken, or venison until it’s no
longer pink inside.
2. Add some chopped vegetables, such as peas, carrots,
and/or green beans.
Use raw vegetables for optimum vitamin availability. Cook
the veggies slightly if your dog is less than 20 pounds.
3. For roughage, add cooked brown rice.
4. Add some doggie vitamins and a sprinkle of garlic as a
parasite repellent.
If you cook up a bunch of the above, with variations in the meat
base, you can freeze it for future use. This will make homemade
meals for your dog a little more convenient for you. Frozen into
meal-sized packets, you just heat it up a bit in the microwave
before giving it to your dog. (Dogs really do prefer warm meals.)
Chapter 7: Chasing the Chuckwagon: The Basics of Feeding 85

For dogs who need to go on a low-calorie diet, restrict the grains to
a bare minimum, if you include them at all, and add more green
vegetables. Vegetables such as green beans offer a lot of fiber,
making your dog feel fuller without all the calories.
For an entire chapter devoted to the pros and cons of homemade
diets, along with recipes for adult dogs as well as puppies, check
out Dog Health & Nutrition For Dummies, by M. Christine Zink, DVM,
PhD (Wiley).
Raw diet
You may have heard about the raw diet called the BARF diet. 
In this case, BARF is short for biologically appropriate raw foods.
Proponents of this type of diet claim that it is closer to what dogs
would eat if they were out in the wild and that it makes them
healthier (illustrated by their shiny coats and clean teeth).
The drawback to feeding your mixed-breed dog raw meat is that 
it often harbors deadly bacteria, such as salmonella or botulism.
These bacteria can be fatal to humans, and many veterinarians say
it’s dangerous to dogs as well. Due to these dangers, I stay away
from feeding my own dogs any raw meat, though I often feed them
raw vegetables and fruit as between-meal rewards.
Feeding the BARF diet requires more of your time and energy 
than just a homemade meal. You’ll have to store the raw foods
safely and also soak the meats in specific bacteria-killing sub-
stances such as grapefruit seed extract. As with the homemade
diet, you need to add fresh raw vegetables, fruit, and bone meal, 
as well as fish and/or flaxseed oil to include all the nutrients your
dog requires.
Because most vegetables contain cellulose, which dogs cannot
digest, raw vegetables will need to be blended so that the dog
receives the full vitamins from them.
Cook all grains that you add to your dog’s food. Even in the wild,
canines rarely eat uncooked grains. They get their grains from the
stomach contents of their prey — and that grain has already been
chewed and digestively processed.
When feeding a raw diet, your dog will need raw meaty bones
every day. You’ll also have to alternate the meats so that he gets
organ meat as well as muscle meat.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
86

To ensure you always have a consistent raw diet available to your
mixed-breed dog, prepare a week’s worth of meals ahead of time,
place each meal portion in a freezer-safe storage container and
then into the freezer. In the morning, take out enough for two
meals, heating one in the microwave prior to feeding your dog, 
and placing the other in the refrigerator for his evening meal.
Raw diets must be frozen for safekeeping. Because raw foods 
often harbor bacteria, poor food-preserving practices will increase
the potency of these bacteria and spread them. Always wash your
hands well after handling the raw meats and vegetables and make
sure you wash your dog’s dishes immediately after he finishes eating.
Don’t touch! Foods and plants 
that are poisonous to dogs
Some plants and foods are dangerous for your mixed-breed dog, and
you need to know what they are so you can prevent dangerous acci-
dents. The following is a list of indoor and outdoor plants to avoid.
Make sure that you don’t leave these items anywhere that your dog
can get to them, either indoors or in his outdoor play area.
Chapter 7: Chasing the Chuckwagon: The Basics of Feeding 87

 Azalea
 Caladium
 Castor bean
 Cyclamen
 Daffodil bulbs
 Elephant ear
 English ivy
 Foxglove
 Holly berries
 Hyacinth bulbs
 Hydrangea
 Iris
 Kalanchoe

 Mistletoe berries
 Oleander
 Philodendron
 Poinsettia
 Rhododendron
 Rhubarb
 Sago palm
 Tulip bulbs
 Wisteria seeds
 Yew
Here are foods to be sure your dog never eats (whether by being
given the food by someone in your family, or by digging through
the garbage and finding it on his own):

 Chocolate: The most dangerous of foods to dogs is chocolate.
Never, ever feed your dog candy or other sweets that contain
chocolate or cocoa. Too much is often fatal.
 Grapes: Grapes cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, lethargy, and
vomiting in dogs.
 Coffee: Coffee causes not only abdominal symptoms but also
seizures, labored breathing, heart arrhythmia, coma, and, in
some cases, death.
 Onions: Onions cause intestinal distress, liver damage, con-
vulsions, and sometimes death.
 Mushrooms: Mushrooms cause the same symptoms as onions.
 Nicotine: Nicotine is dangerous to dogs so be sure to watch
what he picks up on the sidewalk or street, and if he’s picked
up a cigarette butt, get it out of his mouth before he swallows it.
If your dog does eat any of these poisonous foods, watch him care-
fully for any severe reactions, such as diarrhea, gagging, or vomit-
ing. If he does have a reaction, take him to the vet immediately.
How Much to Feed
You can’t find the right amount to feed your mixed breed on a box,
bag, or can of commercial dog food, though feeding guidelines are
clearly printed there. In my experience, if you were to follow those
directions, your dog would be a rolling tub of lard in short order,
and the dog-food company would be a little bit richer.
Each dog is an individual, with his own needs. In the following 
sections, I give you some guidelines to go by.
If you read the following sections, and you still have absolutely no
idea how much to feed your dog, you can ask
 Your veterinarian: Veterinarians can make an educated guess
on the amount needed to give your dog appropriate nutrition.
 A canine nutritionist: This person can give you an even
better idea of what to feed your dog, because she specializes
in proper nutrition for animals.
 The dog’s breeder or foster guardian: This person has been
feeding your dog for a while and can give you some advice on
what worked while the dog lived there.
After you’ve had your dog for a few weeks, you’ll know whether
you’re giving him the correct amount of food. You can tell by look-
ing at his body. Search for your dog’s waistline — it’s just above his
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
88

hipbones and below the rib cage. That waistline should not pro-
trude wider than your dog’s hips or ribs. When running your hands
along his abdomen, you should be able to easily feel his ribs. On
the other hand, you shouldn’t see his ribs protruding either. You
shouldn’t be able to count his ribs or see the ridges of his back-
bone; if you can, it’s a sign that he’s underweight.
A dog with a good energy level is usually of normal weight. This dog
can play for a half-hour or more without tiring; whereas a dog who
is overweight rarely exercises for more than ten minutes before
needing to rest. An overweight dog will pant heavily and take a long
time to recuperate. Watching your dog during and after exercise is a
good way to judge how much you should be feeding him.
Feeding according to your dog’s age
Younger dogs have a faster metabolism than older dogs do, so they
require more food, more frequently. Younger dogs are also more
energetic — they play more than older dogs.
If you have a puppy between the ages of 4 weeks and 5 months,
feed him three times each day — morning, noon, and evening. The
morning meal should offer the most nutrition and the most food.
The noon meal can gradually decrease in size as the dog ages. The
evening meal can be a similar amount to the morning meal, though
you may want to offer just a little bit less as the dog ages.
When your dog reaches 5 months of age, he might naturally decrease
his midday intake, preferring a biscuit to a full meal. Giving him a 
biscuit is a great way of weaning him away from three meals a day.
From the ages of about 6 months to almost 4 years, two meals a
day will be enough, as long as he gets appropriate nutrients and
high protein.
After sterilization (neutering or spaying), reduce your dog’s food
intake by 25 to 30 percent, because his metabolism will automati-
cally slow due to the lack of reproductive hormones. A popular
myth is that sterilization causes dogs to become fat and lazy. 
The reality is that dogs become fat due to too much food for their
metabolism, and they become lazy because they’re too fat to exer-
cise. If you monitor his food intake and give him enough exercise,
he won’t become fat or lazy.
When dogs reach middle age (as young as 4 or 5 for extra-large
dogs, or closer to 10 for the tiniest of breeds), their energy level
decreases, and their metabolism slows, so they don’t need as many
calories. At this point, your mixed-breed dog should be fed half
what he got as a teenager (when he was 5 to 10 months of age).
Chapter 7: Chasing the Chuckwagon: The Basics of Feeding 89

Senior dogs sleep most of the time. You’ll need to put more effort
into involving him in exercise activities and decrease his food
allowance a little bit more, because he won’t burn many calories
and has a very slowed metabolism. His diet should be rich in fiber
and protein, and very low in fats and carbs.
Feeding according to your dog’s size
Toy-sized dogs (those weighing less than 15 pounds) rarely eat
more than  1⁄4 cup of food per meal. Regardless of how much exer-
cise your Toy-sized dog gets, don’t offer much more food than this.
Be sure that each meal is high in nutrients, however, so that your
little dog gets the most out of the little bit he consumes as possible.
Small dogs (those weighing 15 to 25 pounds) should get approxi-
mately 1⁄3 cup of food per meal.
The food requirements of medium-size dogs (those weighing 25 to
55 pounds) vary more according to their age and breed combina-
tions. Whereas the younger Sporting, Herding, and Terrier breeds
have a faster metabolism and higher energy level, the older ones
are far more sedate — with the exception of several Herding
breeds who are highly energetic most of their lives. I suggest feed-
ing the younger dogs up to 1 cup of food per meal; for dogs older
than 5 years of age, reduce the food to 3⁄4 cup per meal.
Large dogs (those weighing 55 to 90 pounds) should receive at least
1 to 2 cups of food mixture per meal. Some very large dogs need 1 1⁄2
to 3 cups per meal until they reach their senior years, which unfor-
tunately come earlier for large dogs; many by the time they reach 5
years of age. As they slow down, reduce the amount you feed.
Special Dietary Needs
Not all foods are right for all dogs. As dogs age, or even due to
genetics, some dogs need special diets to stay healthy and happy.
Here are a few signs telling you that what you’re currently feeding
may not be right for your dog:
 Your dog is scratching a lot.
 Your dog tends to get frequent ear infections.
 Your dog has really bad gas.
 Your dog has loose, light-colored stool or diarrhea.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
90

 Your dog has lick granulomas on his legs.
 Your dog’s coat is dry, dull, and coarse.
There’s really no way to know for sure which specific ingredient is
causing your dog distress without narrowing it down by feeding
fewer ingredients. Because the most common allergy is to specific
meats, that’s the first item you should change. The most common
switch is from chicken or beef to lamb, duck, venison, or fish.
Another common allergy is to grains, such as corn and wheat,
common fillers in commercial kibble. Many dogs have allergies to
these grains, which manifests itself in an itchy coat, watery eyes,
ear infections, and lick granulomas. Rice can be another culprit;
you can easily remove rice from your dog’s diet to see if this was
the cause of his allergic reactions.
Try eliminating some of these common allergens before giving your
dog prescription medications, which treat the symptoms but not
the source of the allergies.
Dogs suffering from physical ailments such as cancer, diabetes, 
or organ malfunction need prescription diets from a veterinarian.
For example, you may need a low-sodium prescription diet if your
dog suffers from heart disease, a prescription diet high in complex
carbohydrates for a dog with diabetes, or a low-protein prescrip-
tion diet for a dog with liver problems. Only a veterinarian can test
for these disorders, so you’ll serve your dog best by getting the
correctly formulated diets that your vet provides.
It’s My Treat: Giving Your Dog 
a Little Something Extra
Everyone likes giving their dogs special treats. My dogs get one
whenever they do something especially well, such as sitting on
command, coming when called, or after performing a special trick.
They don’t receive a special treat without first earning it. In fact,
they must sit prior to receiving their regular meals.
I try to keep all treats wholesome and free of fillers, preservatives,
and other contaminants, so I take the same cautions when buying
treats as I do when choosing my dogs’ regular food: I read labels.
Freeze-dried liver is the treat of choice for most of the dogs I’ve
known. It’s what I call “puppy candy.” But just like candy, it’s also
high in calories, so I don’t recommend feeding your dog a lot of it,
even during training sessions. I alternate freeze-dried liver with
lamb, venison, or buffalo jerky that has been dried and preserved
Chapter 7: Chasing the Chuckwagon: The Basics of Feeding 91

with vitamin E. These types of treats tend to be expensive to buy,
but you can make them for not much money (if you’re willing to
spend the time). Another alternative is to take luncheon meats,
microwave them for a few seconds until they’re crisp, and serve
these as training treats.
On rare occasions I also give my dogs hard edible treats such as
gourmet health chews (of various flavors, especially the mint for
their breath), Booda dental bones, and raw vegetables such as 
carrots, broccoli, and green beans. When I’m chopping apples for
an apple pie, the dogs get the apple cores. After dinner, they each
get a small morsel of leftover meat or vegetable. (Remember:
I’m stressing small morsel because I wouldn’t want to give them
enough of anything to cause an allergic reaction, especially for 
my dogs with beef and chicken allergies.)
Though many people like to give their dogs pizza crusts, bread
heels, and commercial dog biscuits, I steer away from these things
because they contain grains, which may cause an allergic reaction.
As for special-occasion treats, keep it minimal. After holiday meals,
you can give your dog a bit of lean meat, but none of the fixings
because those contain spices, which might cause stomach distress.
On hot days, or if you have a teething puppy, bouillon popsicles
are a real treat. Here’s the recipe:
1. Boil 2 cups of water.
2. Dissolve 2 bouillon cubes in the boiling water.
You can use any type of bouillon that is low-salt and free of
spices. I usually prefer to use the chicken variety, because
it’s less messy.
3. Allow the bouillon water to cool for an hour.
4. Pour the bouillon water into an ice-cube tray and put it in
the freezer.
5. Serve your dog a frozen cube.
To prevent a mess inside your house, give it to him outside
or on an easy-to-clean surface such as linoleum.

W
ould you be willing to walk out of your home without having
brushed your teeth, combed your hair, and changed your
clothes? How many days could you last like that? Good grooming
isn’t just about appearance — it’s also about good overall health.
Because dogs aren’t self-grooming, like cats, we need to give them 
a hand, or two, to stay clean, healthy, and free of parasites.
In this chapter, I tell you everything you need to know about
grooming — from bathing your dog to cleaning her teeth and ears.
I also tell you how to keep your dog free of parasites like fleas and
ticks. If your dog could tell you to read one chapter of this book,
this would be pretty near the top of her list!
Why Grooming Matters: 
Inside and Out
Does your dog fill with excitement when you pick her up at the
grooming salon? Isn’t she clean enough to cuddle? What dog 
doesn’t like being loved on and cuddled! Would you do that 
with a mud-encrusted, parasite-infested dog with bad breath? 
Of course not. The trouble is, that dirty dog doesn’t understand
that she’s not getting attention because she’s dirty — all she
knows is she’s not getting the attention she needs and wants.

Besides having a clean house companion, there are other sanitary
and medical reasons for keeping your dog clean:
 A clean dog has a coat free of tangles. What’s the big deal
about a few snarls? Try letting your hair get all matted and
tangled and get back to me on how that feels. Not only does 
it look bad, but it can actually hurt.
 A clean dog is free of debris between her toes, under her
tail, in skin wrinkles, and in other areas you don’t want me
to go into.
 Regular grooming removes dead skin and brings out the
natural oils in the coat. These natural oils not only make your
dog’s coat shiny but also help it serve as a better insulator
against all types of weather.
 When you groom your dog regularly, you quickly locate any
injuries or parasites, and you can treat them right away.
Plus, the time you spend grooming your mixed breed is important
bonding time — you’re showing your dog that you care about her.
And a dog who is clean will be welcome near you — you’ll want to
run your hands through her coat and give her hugs. What better
reason to groom your dog could there be?
Brushing Your Dog
The amount of time you need to spend brushing your dog depends
largely on your dog’s coat type and propensity for getting dirty. If
your dog loves to roll in the dirt, you’ll be bathing her a lot. I once
had a dog who loved going to the farm next door, rolling in the
freshest cow pie he could find, and coming home, prancing with
pride at how well he had covered his scent. He wasn’t as pleased
about the frequent baths though.
Even if your mixed breed is primarily an indoor dog, with little
exposure to cow pies, mud puddles, and other digging opportuni-
ties, you’ll still want to brush her a couple times each week to
remove loose fur, dander, and detangle long strands.
If you’ve been to a pet store lately and looked at the options in 
the brush aisle, you may have been overwhelmed. Here’s a quick
guide, based on your dog’s coat type:
 Short coat: For a dog with very short fur, use a massaging
glove. Not only will this make her groan with delight, but it
will also loosen the dead fur and dirt, forming a mat on the
glove that’s easily removed.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
94

 Medium coat: For a dog with medium length fur, use a 
bristle brush. This will loosen the dropped fur, remove 
debris caught in the coat and detangle. Most bristle brushes
are easily cleaned by balling up the fur as you pull it from the
bristles.
 Long coat: For a dog with a long coat, I suggest using a 
wide-tooth comb. Look for one with rolling tines. The 
rolling tines help detangle the coat without pulling it and
causing your dog distress from painful fur tugging. The 
comb is great for dogs with feathering on their legs, tail, 
or chest areas; use a bristle brush for the shorter fur on 
the back and head.
No matter what kind of coat your dog has, always use a very 
soft brush for the dog’s face, because the facial areas are very 
sensitive.
Some dogs have double coats — wooly undercoats and long
stranded top coats. These require a special tool called a rake. It
looks like a mini-rake with wide spaced tines along a long, flat bar.
Comb the dog’s undercoat with the rake, removing loose intertwin-
ing wooly hairs. Then do the top coat with the comb. The Nordic
dog breeds tend to have this wooly undercoat along with many of
the northern breeds.
If your dog has very dry skin, she’ll need a spritzing with a mixture
of water and leave-in conditioner. As you groom your dog, give a
spritz to wet down the fur a bit, and then brush it into the coat
with a firm bristle brush. The coat will remain soft, as will the dog’s
skin, allowing the coat to lay flatter against the dog and be more
efficient as insulation against extreme weather conditions. If your
dog has dry skin, you’ll see little white specs of dandruff in her
coat. She’ll also be scratching a lot.
Cleaning Your Dog’s Ears
Everything from mites to dirt to bacteria can cause ear infections
in a dog. If you don’t give weekly attention to your dog’s ears, she
may be more prone to getting ear infections. And ear infections
aren’t just minor annoyances — they can cause hearing loss,
damage to the middle ear, and/or fever from a bacterial infection.
Most dogs will show clear signs of ear irritation and infection. They
shake their heads, rub their ears against solid objects, or use their
paws to scratch at their ears. If the infection gets worse, you’ll
likely smell a foul odor coming from the ear, see small granular dirt
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Mixed Breed 95

particles, and notice a topical rash from your dog’s constant
scratching.
The only means of curing infections is the appropriate ear medica-
tion. Your veterinarian will need to inspect the ear and possibly
take a sample of the infectious material. The prescribed cure is
anything from ear ointment to antibiotics, depending on the cause
of the infection.
To prevent infection, clean your dog’s ears at least once a week,
regardless of the type of ears your dog has. However, you may 
need to clean your dog’s ears more often — such as after bathing 
or swimming. (Water tends to remain in the ears, especially if 
the ears have a fold-over structure.) Dogs with upright ears allow
moisture to dry out quickly, so you’ll only need to do a minor ear
cleaning.
Dogs who have Retriever or Spaniel heritage may have smaller ear
canals than other dogs, making them ripe for contracting infections.
This special structure — along with the heavy fold-over ears —
retains moisture, dirt, and bacteria. Other types of dogs who tend
to get chronic ear infections are Bloodhounds and Bassett Hounds;
they have very heavy droopy ears that don’t allow air to flow within
the canals to dry out retained moisture. Along with the heavy ears,
their length scoops up dirt. So besides cleaning the inside, you also
need to clean the outside, or they’ll get very smelly.
The next time you take your dog in to the veterinarian for an exam-
ination, ask him to show you how to clean your dog’s ears. But
here are basic ear-cleaning procedures to follow after you’ve seen
it done by your vet:
1. Squirt a couple drops of herbal ear cleaner into the 
dog’s ear.
2. Rub her ear for a couple seconds to loosen any dirt 
and grease.
3. With a soft cloth wrapped around your index finger,
gently remove the loosened dirt from the outer canal 
features and inside of the ear flap.
4. Repeat with the other ear.
Never clean deep in the dog’s ear canal. You can damage the dog’s
ear and hearing that way. If you think something might be located
deeper inside your dog’s ear, have your veterinarian do a thorough
cleaning and exam.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
96

Some dogs have lots of hair in their ears. This can clog the air flow
that is needed to dry moisture. From time to time, tweeze these
hairs — only those that come out easily — so that the outer ear
can remain dryer. If you’re not sure how to do this, take your dog
to the groomer to have it done professionally.
Look, Ma — No Cavities! Brushing
Your Canine’s Choppers
Brushing a dog’s teeth is a part of routine maintenance that 
many dog owners overlook. But if you think about it, your dog’s
teeth are as important to her overall health and well-being as your
own. Would you skip brushing your teeth for a couple days? A
week? A year? Absolutely not! And, it’s not just because teeth that
haven’t been brushed cause bad breath. Without regular brushing,
you can develop gum disease that may cause you to lose your
teeth and can even harm organs such as your heart. The same
goes for dogs!
If your dog loses her teeth at a young age, it will shorten her 
lifespan because she can’t eat as she should. Plus, if she loses 
her teeth due to lack of dental care, the gum infections may cause
problems with her internal organs as well.
Introduce your mixed-breed dog to dental cleaning in as positive a
manner as possible. Use a meat-flavored toothpaste (they come in
beef, poultry, and liver flavors) that your dog will love, along with a
long-handled toothbrush or a finger brush.
Place a little paste on the brush and begin brushing the front teeth.
These are the easiest to start with because they don’t require your
pushing the brush farther into the dog’s mouth. Brush in a circular
motion so that you cover each tooth. Remember to brush the back
of each tooth (the side closest to the tongue). Be sure to give your
dog frequent breaks to lick the paste off her teeth, which will keep
the experience positive for her. When she’s relaxed, work on the
teeth farther back in the mouth. Gently pull the dog’s skin away
from the teeth (as shown in Figure 8-1), so you can access the
teeth easier.
Talk to your vet if you’re at all unsure that you’re brushing your 
dog’s teeth correctly. He’ll be happy to show you the right way 
to do it.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Mixed Breed 97

Figure 8-1: Brushing your dog’s teeth is a vital part of canine care. Ease your dog
into it, and make sure brushing is always a positive experience for her.
The Eyes Have It: Caring for 
Your Mixed Breed’s Eyes
Unless your mixed-breed dog has allergies or protruding eyes, you
won’t have to do much to take care of them. However, if your dog
has allergies, you’ll need to apply an optic solution to keep her
eyes clear of discharge; your vet can suggest the appropriate 
solution for your dog.
If your dog has protruding eyes, they’re likely to collect dirt parti-
cles, causing the dog’s eyes to water or become irritated. Dogs
with protruding eyes also tend to have constant tearing, which
stains their facial fur. Products are available to clean the stains 
as well as those to clear the eyes of debris.
Cleaning your dog’s eyes on a weekly basis (more often if she 
has protruding eyes) is a good idea. Even if she doesn’t have any
allergies or problems with her eyes, it will help train her to have
her head held gently in case she ever does need medication.

Mani/Pedi Time: Clipping 
Your Dog’s Nails
Dog’s nails grow quickly, and you’ll probably need to clip your
dog’s nails every six weeks, regardless of her size, breed mixture,
or age. If your dog spends most of her time on soft surfaces (such
as dirt, grass, or sand), she may need her nails clipped more often.
Even if you walk your dog on sidewalks or along the street, you’ll
still need to clip her nails on the sides of the feet as well as the
dew-claw nails.
If your dog doesn’t like having her nails done, you’ll need to take her
to a professional groomer or to a vet to have them clipped. If you
want to do it yourself, however, you’ll need to make certain your
mixed breed will remain calm while you’re clipping — otherwise, you
might clip the nail in the wrong place and cause severe bleeding.
Before clipping the nail, look at how it curves. If your dog has at
least one white nail, take note at how far around the curve the pink
color (known as the quick) goes (see Figure 8-2). This will guide
you on where to clip — you want to remain at least 1⁄8 inch away
from the quick to avoid injuring your dog.
If you plan on clipping your dog’s nails yourself, have some styptic
powder handy to help stop any accidental bleeding that might
occur from cutting too closely.
Figure 8-2: Look carefully at where the nail hooks. This is where you’ll want to
apply the nail clippers in order to avoid clipping too closely.
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Mixed Breed 99

If you want to teach your dog to accept nail clipping, use lots of
treats and take your time. Here are some basic steps to follow:
1. Show her the nail clippers and speaking in a soothing,
pleasant tone while touching her feet with them.
2. When she accepts the presence of the clippers, hold her
feet and separate her toes while touching them with the
clippers.
3. Clip one nail, and then allow her to relax as you pet her
and speak to her in a soothing tone of voice.
4. Clip another nail, and pause again for praising her.
5. Repeat this procedure until all her nails are done.
6. Release her and play with a toy together.
Keep all grooming activities positive so that your dog will easily
allow you to work with her.
Bathing Your Dog
How often you need to bathe your dog depends on your dog’s
lifestyle. Obviously, the more she plays outdoors, the more she’ll
need to be bathed. However, if she has a Poodle or Lab-type coat,
she’ll likely repel dirt rather nicely, so a quick wipe is sufficient to
prevent her from dragging debris into your home. Even so, a dirt-
resistant coat doesn’t help with odor. Large dogs tend to have
strong body odor, especially those who insist on covering their
own scent by rolling in dead fish or other carcasses.
Scent covering is a natural instinct in hunting dogs — they want to
camouflage themselves from their prey. Rolling in something dead
often takes away their predatory smell, allowing them to get closer
without alarming the prey animal.
If you have a very small dog, you can bathe her once a week in a sink.
If your dog weighs more than 15 pounds, a bathtub would work best.
Most sinks and tubs tend to have a slippery surface. Use a rubber
tub or sink mat to prevent your dog from sliding around. A dog
who feels secure where she stands will be less likely to get scared
during the bath.
Unless you have a smaller mixed-breed dog and have no problem
lifting her and placing her into the tub, you’ll need to teach her
how to enter and exit the tub on her own; as well as how to remain
inside the tub while she’s being cleaned. Here’s a positive proce-
dure to help acclimate your mixed breed to the bathing process:
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
100

1. Take your mixed-breed dog to an empty, dry tub and
throw some treats inside.
Allow your dog to get the treats without forcing her.
2. Repeat Step 1 until your dog easily jumps into the tub to
get her treats.
3. Begin asking your dog to remain in the tub by caressing
her after she gets her treats. Gently hold her in place
while caressing and offering soft praise.
4. Each time she enters the tub, gradually increase the
amount of time you coax her into staying there.
5. When you want to let her exit the tub, coax her to you as
you move backward. Give her another reward when she
comes to you, and then rub her with a dry towel.
This is even more rewarding because your mixed breed will
enjoy being groomed and caressed.
6. Follow the same routine with a little bit of water in the tub.
Because your dog has accepted the tub as a positive activ-
ity, the addition of the water shouldn’t be a deterrent.
7. When your dog is comfortable getting in with a little
water, add enough water for the bath, add soap, and
wash her all over.
Be sure to give your dog lots of rewards and gentle praise
throughout the bathing process so that she continues to
enjoy it.
If you have to wash your dog’s face, apply some eye ointment
(available from your vet) prior to bathing her. It’ll keep your dog’s
eyes safe from the sting of soap, in case some accidentally gets in
her eye. If your dog has protruding eyes, applying the eye ointment
should be the first thing you do prior to bathing.
If your dog has long fur, apply some conditioner to her coat after
you rinse off the soap. This will help with detangling her fur,
making it easier to comb her out after her bath.
Don’t try to comb your dog’s coat while it’s wet. Brushing and
combing is far more difficult wet than dry, and if you try to do it
while your dog is wet, you’ll end up pulling harder on her skin,
making the process a lot less fun for her (and for you!).
Checking for Parasites
During the warmer months, make a daily parasite check part of the
care routine. You can make it a positive experience for your dog by
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Mixed Breed 101

merely caressing her in a methodical manner (see “The Daily Once-
Over: Checking Your Dog for Problems,” later in this chapter, for
some guidelines).
To check for the presence of fleas separate your dog’s fur along her
back, underside, head, and neck. If you see any little black specs
(almost like pepper), that’s flea waste. And where there’s waste,
you can be pretty sure that there are adult fleas present as well.
The adult fleas are unmistakable — they’re little black bugs crawl-
ing along your dog’s skin.
If that doesn’t creep you out enough, wait till you come across a
tick, burrowed into your dog’s skin. Like fleas, ticks thrive on your
dog’s blood. However, unlike fleas, they don’t move over the dog’s
surface — they dig into her skin.
Internal parasites are tougher to detect. You may be able to see
tapeworm pieces in your dog’s feces, but the other types of worms
must be seen through a microscope. Many types of worms — such
as heartworm, whipworm, and hookworm — can be fatal. So it’s a
good idea to take a fecal sample to your veterinarian every six
months to stay on top of the internal parasite problem.
There are several ways to prevent all topical and some internal
parasite infestations, as well as ways to clear them. I cover all this
in the following sections.
Preventing parasites
Apply a topical oil such as Frontline, K9 Advantix, or Revolution to
your dog every month. These will kill any topical parasite that lands
upon your dog and/or bites your dog’s skin. Because the parasite
doesn’t have a chance to transfer its saliva or lay its eggs, it will also
reduce the incidence of internal parasites. Because heartworm and
tapeworm are transported by biting fleas, the topical oil will reduce
your dog’s risk of infestation. A monthly heartworm tablet also
reduces the risk of heartworm infestation as well as several other
worms such as hookworm, whipworm, and roundworm. Some types
of heartworm medications, such as Sentinel, disrupt the reproduc-
tive cycle of biting fleas, dramatically reducing their population but
don’t outright kill them like the topical oils. Frontline, Advantix, and
Revolution protect against fleas and ticks.
A home remedy that often works to prevent parasites are daily
doses of brewer’s yeast and garlic tablets. The garlic repels bugs 
of all sorts while the brewer’s yeast is great for your dog’s diges-
tive system.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
102

Curing parasites
The cure for internal parasites is prescription medicine available
from your veterinarian. If your dog has a heartworm infestation,
the treatment is long-term. Most of the other internal parasites can
be treated with one or two doses of the appropriate medication.
A dog with a flea and tick infestation can easily be treated with one
Capstar tablet. This will safely kill all parasites on the dog’s body
within four hours. Contain your dog in a small space that’s easy to
clean during this treatment. While she’s being treated, you must
treat your home to prevent a reinfestation when she returns. The
best type of foggers to use for home treatment are those containing
Siphotrol — it’s the safest and most effective. Siphotrol kills not only
adult fleas, but also the larvae, which many insecticides won’t kill.
Here’s a great way of ridding yourself of those pesky fleas:
1. Take the dog to a groomer or vet for a flea bath.
2. Before bringing the dog home, fog the entire house 
and spray the entire yard. Also, spray the interior 
of the vehicle you used to transport the dog.
3. Repeat this program in ten days, because the flea eggs
will have hatched and the cycle will begin again.
If you walk your dog through areas where other dogs visit, there’s a
high possibility of your dog contracting a parasite. Prevention is
the best means of ensuring your dog’s health. Use the topical treat-
ments and monthly heartworm pills.
The Daily Once-Over: Checking
Your Dog for Problems
Make it a point to go over your dog daily and check for injuries,
cuts, bruises, parasites, and suspicious lumps. As your mixed
breed ages, this daily check becomes more important. Dogs rarely
let you know that they aren’t feeling well or in pain — in fact, the
dog’s nature is to not show weakness, so you’ll be the last to know
when something’s wrong.
Sometimes dogs appear lethargic or have a lack of appetite when
they’re feeling poorly. However, an illness has to progress to an
alarming point for this to happen. Daily checks will help you dis-
cover something that might be the beginning of a problem — for
example, a wound that might become infected, a lump that might
be the beginning of cancer, a flea that will bite and cause your dog
Chapter 8: Grooming Your Mixed Breed 103

to have an allergic reaction. All these things, and more, can be
detected by a daily once-over.
Here’s a great way to do a thorough daily check while also giving
your dog a great massage:
1. Begin at the dog’s nose: Using your fingertips, rub her
nose in a circular manner.
This will allow you to feel any scabby skin or lumps while
giving your dog a very relaxing massage.
2. Move up her head, around her forehead, cheeks, lower
jaw, and the base of her ears.
Familiarize yourself with her dimples, moles, and whiskers.
Often there is lumpy skin around each whisker.
3. Look inside her ears, and rub the ear from base to tip.
This will help locate any extra dirt or grease, as well as
ticks. Ticks often latch on to the inside of the ear flap
because the skin is moist and warm.
4. Move down the neck: Still use your fingertips, though
you can begin to apply a little more pressure.
The skin is a bit tougher than on the face, and you’ll have
more fur to go through as well.
5. With the dog’s head and neck checked, move your hand
along the center of her back.
You can move your hands in a straight line down her spine,
and then use the circular motions on each side, gently
touching the loin area, sides, and tummy.
6. Check the chest and shoulders: Long chest fur is a prime
target for loose debris and tangles.
Use your fingers as you would a brush, starting at the top
of the neck and combing downward.
7. Check the legs, again using a circular motion with your
fingertips on the skin. At her knees and hocks, enclose
her joints in your hand feeling for excessive heat.
Heat is the first sign of a joint disorder, swelling may or
may not be present depending on the problem.
8. Check your dog’s toes and foot pads.
Keep in mind that she walks around barefoot all day and
she may cut a pad or get debris entangled between the
pads (if your dog has long foot fur).
When you’ve completed your daily check, your mixed-breed dog is
sure to be snoring and drooling!

Exercising Your Dog
In This Chapter
 Figuring out how much exercise your dog needs
 Finding fun activities to do with your dog
D
ogs are extreme athletes. They require exercise to remain
healthy and happy. Few are natural couch potatoes — but
they become couch potatoes after living with humans for a while.
Some breeds don’t require much exercise, but the majority of
breeds do.
Your mixed-breed dog probably has at least some ancestors who
had a drive to work, hunt, or herd. Your dog may not be a purebred
hunting, working, or herding dog, but that doesn’t mean that his
drive to go out and chase rabbits or herd cows has disappeared.
Your job is to find exercise activities that can help your dog satisfy
his natural instincts.
In this chapter, I fill you in on how much exercise your dog needs
and give you some suggestions for activities to try with your dog.
Regardless of how you give your dog his exercise, you can be cer-
tain he’ll have the most fun if you share the activities with him.
Knowing How Much Exercise 
Your Dog Needs
A dog’s exercise requirements depend on many factors, including
his age, breed combination, and size. For example, dogs who have
Herding blood need to run and exercise a lot every day, because
they were designed to help farmers, while dogs with Sporting
blood generally won’t need more than a couple of good long games
of fetch, because their jobs traditionally were to aid hunters in
locating and returning game.

Puppies
Your puppy will go through several stages of development that 
will affect his level of energy. Some studies suggest that a dog
matures the equivalent of 21 human years within his first year 
of life and 5 years each year thereafter. If you consider the behav-
ioral stages of people (and puppies), this is a good assumption.
Imagine taking a child all the way from infancy to the legal drinking
age in one year — that’s what you have when you bring home 
a puppy!
Physically, the puppy grows from a little, short legged, roly-
poly, round-faced cutie into a dog with a sleek, more angular
physique. After the first year, your dog won’t change much 
physically.
Here’s an overview of what kind of energy levels (and exercise
requirements) you can expect from your pup in the first year of 
his life:
 Four weeks to three months: Between the ages of 4 weeks
and 3 months, pups tend to sleep most of the time. They have
short little bursts of energy but they quickly tire out. A few
minutes outside and they’re beat.
 Three to four months: When a pup is about 3 to 4 months 
old, his energy level changes a bit. He’ll play more and for
longer periods of time. This is when your pup begins testing
his position in the pack — he’ll display dominance when he
plays with you or other dogs. He’ll get into tug-of-war games
in earnest. Fetch becomes a fantastic idea. Chasing butterflies
is also very exciting. On average, a dog of this age requires a
half-hour of exercise at least five times a day.
 Five to seven months: At the age of 5 to 7 months, your puppy
will be at the peak of adolescence. This is the period when
he’ll need more exercise than he will at any other time in his
life. Not only will he be testing his pack position, but he’ll be
very easily distracted and want to do a zillion things at once
(just like the typical teenager). At this age, your puppy needs
loads of exercise! An adolescent dog requires at least several
hours of exercise each day; if your dog is a mixture of the
Herding, Sporting, or Terrier breeds, I recommend even more.
Your dog will need the freedom to run in a safely fenced area.
Play with other dogs is the best means of blowing off steam.
Though your pup will quickly tire during training sessions,
these aren’t enough to rid him of the zoomies.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
106

 Eight to ten months: Between 8 and 10 months, your young
dog is still full of energy, but he’s able to channel it a bit
better. If you offer him regular activities, he’ll be happy to 
participate. He’ll also begin showing signs of maturity, with 
a better understanding of the house rules. He’ll have more
moments of lying at your feet than in the previous three
months. An older adolescent dog still needs lots of exercise
time; I suggest two to three hours each day. His exercise can
be a combination of play with other dogs and a regulated
activity such as a training session.
 Ten months to one year: Between 10 and 12 months, your dog
has become an adult. Don’t worry — he’ll still be playful and
energetic. In fact, many dogs are energetic well into old age. 
If you give appropriate exercise outlets, you’ll have a happy,
healthy, easy-to-manage companion. Your dog will require a
regular exercise regimen, but his activity can be more concen-
trated, such as training time, hiking, biking, or jogging. The
zoomies are gone.
Growing dogs need lots of exercise. Confining them daily for
extended periods of time is detrimental to their physical and
mental development. Young dogs need to stretch their legs and
minds as they mature. You’ll need to discover the proper balance
in order to train your dog the house rules, as well as allow him 
to “be a dog.” Though you should confine him in a safe area when 
you can’t be with him, be sure to observe him closely at play when
you’re home. Make sure to follow an exercise regimen with your
dog. If you exercise with him, it can be great for bonding — and for
your own health as well as his.
Adult dogs
How much exercise an adult dog needs depends in large part on
his breed. Even if you don’t know exactly which breeds make up
your mixed-breed dog’s family tree, you can probably make a good
guess about which general breed groups he’s a part of. For exam-
ple, you can generally tell a hound from a terrier. If you’re just not
sure about your dog, talk to your vet — she’ll probably be able to
steer you in the right direction.
Table 9-1 shows some general recommendations for the amount 
of exercise different dogs need based on their breed group. If you
know your dog has the genetics of one of these breed groups,
you’ll have a fairly good idea of how much exercise your dog 
will need.

Table 9-1 lists the minimum amount of exercise the dog needs
every day. If you have a hound and you want to exercise him more
than one hour a day, your dog won’t have any problems (as long 
as you increase the amount of exercise gradually, just as you’d do
yourself). But if you have a Herding dog and you only give him an
hour of exercise a day, the results could be disastrous. If you’re 
not giving your dog enough exercise, he’ll find all kinds of creative
ways to burn calories on his own — by chewing and digging holes
and doing all sorts of things that’ll drive you crazy.
If you have a high-energy dog who needs three to four hours of
exercise each day, don’t panic. There are ways to work this into
your lifestyle. You don’t have to take your dog on one long three-
or four-hour run. In fact, it’s healthier for your dog if the exercise is
broken up throughout the day. You can take him out for a long walk
first thing in the morning, play tag or fetch with him in the after-
noon, and take him for another long walk or training session in the
evening. Let him blow off some steam playing with other dogs, too.
If you exercise your dog and give him a structured lifestyle, he’ll be
a great companion.
Although allowing your dog to run in a large fenced area is nice, it
isn’t as fulfilling to your dog as taking him for a walk around the
neighborhood or hiking in the woods. Your dog wants to exercise
with you. If you can’t do this on a regular basis, you should have
more than one dog — dogs will play with each other if you can’t be
there to participate. However, they still would prefer to involve you
in the games.
Dogs are athletes. They need to use their energy in a positive
manner. Participating in activities with your dog will fill this need,
while improving the bond you have with your mixed-breed dog.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
108

Older dogs
As your dog gets older, his energy level won’t be what it was when
he was a pup. But he still needs exercise — not as much as when
he was younger, but definitely a good hour per day.
The trick to exercising your older dog is to break up that hour
throughout the day instead of trying to do it all at once. Most older
dogs receive plenty of exercise through two to three 20-minute
walks each day.
So how do you know if your dog is old? The concept of age is rela-
tive to the dog’s breed mixture and size. The giant breeds, such as
Great Danes and Mastiffs, rarely live more than 9 years, on average.
The Retriever and Setter breeds average 10 to 12 years. Large
Hounds 10 years, smaller Hounds 12 to 14 years. Spaniel breeds
often live 13 to 14 years, but Terrier breeds can live 14 to 16 years.
There is a bit of a theme to this that you can apply to your mixed-
breed dog: Smaller dogs tend to live longer — they don’t age as
quickly as larger dogs.
So the age of your dog depends largely on his size, not necessarily
the breeds that constitute his genetics, though there are many
exceptions to this generalization. For example, English Bulldogs, a
mid-sized breed, don’t live much beyond 10 years, while other mid-
sized breeds, such as Cocker Spaniels, have a lifespan upwards of
14 years.
Whether your mixed-breed dog just entered middle age or has
become geriatric, he still needs exercise in order to remain healthy.
As dogs age, arthritis and other physical ailments begin to degen-
erate their skeletal structure. Regular walks help maintain the
muscle tone around their joints, improving their overall ability 
to move.
Finding an Activity 
Your Dog Enjoys
Actually, maybe I should’ve called this section “Finding an Activity
That You Enjoy Doing with Your Dog.” Dogs like almost any activity,
as long as it’s active. And they like any activity that you do with
them. In the following sections, I cover some basic activities that
you can do with your dog to exercise him, as well as some activi-
ties that are a little more out of the ordinary. Take your pick — the
more variety you give your dog, the happier he’ll be!
Chapter 9: Exercising Your Dog 109

Walking
Most dog owners get their dogs so that they’ll have someone to
accompany them on long walks. And most dogs are very happy to
fill this role.
Regardless of where you live, taking a walk with your dog is fun,
healthy, and a great means of developing and maintaining a bond
with your canine.
Jogging and running
Jogging or running is probably the best way of ensuring that both
you and your dog are getting enough exercise. Most runners are
consistent — they go on their daily runs regardless of weather 
or schedule. This consistency is the best thing for your mixed-
breed dog.
Running with your dog has many benefits.
 It’s excellent exercise.
 Your dog learns to stay at your side regardless of distractions.
 If you run on a hard surface, your dog’s nails won’t have to be
trimmed often (or at all), because the pavement will naturally
file them for you.
 It’s a great way of bonding with your dog.
Though you may run 3 miles or more when you exercise, don’t
start your mixed-breed dog at this rate. He needs to gradually
build up tolerance to this distance. Begin him at 1 mile and over a
period of two weeks gradually increase his exercise tolerance to
match yours.
Don’t feed your dog within an hour before or after strenuous 
exercise. Some dogs are prone to bloat (a twisting of the stomach
due to gaseous intake).
Biking
Biking, and having your dog run by your side, is another great way
for your dog to burn off his excess energy.
If you decide to give biking a try, take several precautions because
you, and your dog, can easily be injured:
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
110

 Acclimate your dog to your bicycle. Some dogs would rather
chase bikes than run alongside them. Utilize the heeling exer-
cises in Chapter 11, and apply them to this situation as follows:
1. Have your dog heel with you as you push your 
bicycle.
2. When he’s working well, get on your bike, but keep
your feet on the ground to move it.
3. When your dog is walking nicely at your side, get
on the bike and pedal slowly.
4. Gradually increase the speed as your dog performs
well moving with you.
 Make sure your dog stays on the side of you that is away
from the road. This will prevent his being hit by a car if he
suddenly lunges outward. You can buy a product that will
safely tether your dog to your bike. It’s a metal bar that
attaches to the bike with a hook on the other end to affix your
dog’s leash. This will keep your dog with you, while also keep-
ing him a safe enough distance from the wheels.
There isn’t a product available that will keep your dog watching you
instead of wanting to socialize with the neighbors’ dog as you go by.
Your mixed-breed dog must learn to remain with you regardless of
distractions. This takes obedience training (see Chapter 11). You
might want to begin with walking and running prior to bike riding,
to prepare your dog for remaining with you regardless of your pace.
While you ride your bike or run on a hard surface, your dog is run-
ning on that surface — barefoot! Without the benefit of booties
your dog might injure his pads. I highly recommend a pad condi-
tioner (just a cream that you can rub on your dog’s pads) along
with some type of pad protection.
Fetch
Many dogs enjoy this game, and it doesn’t take a whole lot of effort
on your part. When you develop a routine of playing fetch, you can
teach your mixed-breed dog a variety of themes on the game. Here
are a few suggestions:
 Fetch a specific toy.
 Find and fetch a toy.
 Go find a person.
 Fetch a toy and place it in a box.
 Fetch two toys at the same time.
Chapter 9: Exercising Your Dog 111

If your dog is not into fetching, you can entice him into it. Any dog
can learn to point out something, if it has positive benefits. The fol-
lowing steps teach your dog how to target (touch something with
his nose):
1. Take your dog’s favorite toy and place a treat on it.
2. When he goes to get his treat, make a specific noise, such
as clicking a clicker, or saying “Yes!” in an enthusiastic
tone of voice.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 three times.
Now your dog knows something good comes from touching
that toy. He’ll go touch it without your having to put a treat
on it.
4. When your dog goes to touch the toy, the moment your
dog touches the toy make the same noise as before and
give him a reward.
5. Repeat Step 4 three times.
6. Move the toy to a new location and repeat these 
prior steps.
You can play this game with any number of objects and can 
even turn into a retrieving game. It’s merely a matter of gradually
increasing your criteria prior to giving your dog his reward. For
example, you reward him for touching, and he quickly understands
that concept. Next you hold out for him to actually put his mouth
on the object before making that specific noise and rewarding 
him. Follow this with not rewarding until he actually picks up the
object. In small steps, you can easily teach most dogs to accom-
plish any behavior you want. And your dog will love the challenge
of learning to do what you’re asking.
Hiking
Hiking is similar to walking, but unlike a walk, where you’re likely
in your neighborhood, on a hike, you and your dog head out into
the woods or mountains. You may not be able to count on hiking
every day, depending on where you live and what your schedule is
like, but it can be a great addition to your dog’s exercise routine.
Before you leave for your hike, make sure you’re familiar with the
canine-related rules for the area. Most state parks require dogs to
be leashed. Regardless of where you go, always have a leash with
you in case your dog becomes unruly or more interested in chas-
ing squirrels than listening to you.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
112

A couple more items you’ll want to pack are a collapsible water bowl
and a bottle of fresh water. When dogs exercise — and you can be
sure your dog will be getting a lot of that while hiking with you —
they need to drink lots of water. Many lakes, streams, and rivers are
contaminated with bacteria, so you want to make certain that your
mixed breed isn’t drinking from them. If you give him a fresh water
supply before, during, and after your hike, you shouldn’t have to
worry about him looking for water elsewhere.
Carry a few treats with you so that every time your dog looks
and/or returns to you of his own accord, he gets a reward for doing
so. This will tend to keep him closer to you and less likely to run
after other hikers.
If you’ve been hiking for some time and your dog is just starting to
go with you, you’ll need to gradually increase his tolerance to the
exercise. Dogs will keep going until they drop, so be aware of signs
showing that he’s getting tired. These include
 Heavy panting
 Lying down whenever you pause
 Droopy eyes and ears
 A slow pace
Be sure to check his pads when you take a break. He doesn’t have
the benefit of hiking boots like you do, and you may be crossing
rocky terrain that can easily slice his pads. Have a small first-aid
pack handy (see Chapter 16), just in case.
Swimming
Most dogs love to swim and can do so naturally. Even those who
don’t enjoy bathing, may still like wading in a creek or along the
shore of a lake or ocean. If your mixed breed reliably listens to you
off-leash, he can safely go swimming. You can make it even more
enjoyable by throwing some floating toys into the water for fetch-
ing games. Remember: Your dog will prefer to play games with you
rather than just swim around.
Swimming can be a great way for older dogs with arthritis to get
exercise. They get a workout without the impact that walking
brings with it. Some vets even recommend water therapy for dogs
who are arthritic. All the more reason to get your young dog inter-
ested in the water — that way, as he ages, you can make swimming
an even bigger part of his exercise routine.
Chapter 9: Exercising Your Dog 113

Horse and hound
Horse and hound is one of my all-time favorite activities — and it’s
great exercise for a dog! I love riding horses, and having my dogs
with me during our adventures makes them extra special. Horses
and hounds have been hunting together for millennia, so there’s no
reason why your mixed breed can’t learn how to respect the horse,
watch the horse’s leg movements, and listen to your requests at
the same time. Dogs are great at multitasking, especially when it
means a long run through fields and woods.
Before taking off in a run, you’ll need to acclimate your dog to
horses. Horses are prey animals, and dogs are predators, so you
have to teach your dog to control his natural instincts and to listen
to you from a distance as well. The guidelines in Chapter 11 will
help you train your dog so that participating in horse and hound is
fun and safe for both the hound and the horse.
Part II: Living with Your Mixed-Breed Dog 
114
Ahoy, matie! Boating with 
your mixed-breed dog
Few dogs wouldn’t like to sit at the bow of a boat with their noses to the wind.
Watersports are very popular and lots of fun if your mixed breed can participate.
Several kinds of watersports can be dangerous for your dog, so take the appropri-
ate precautions. Some people like to ride with their dogs on Jet Skis. Although it
looks like a lot of fun, there’s no safety net at all, and you can’t concentrate the way
you should if you’re worried about your dog falling off. Another activity to be wary
of is sailboating. Because sailboats usually tilt on their sides when the wind hits the
sails, a dog can easily slide off and into the water.
Regardless of the type of boating you do, make sure your dog is wearing a flotation
device. Dogs are usually good swimmers, but strong currents, waves, the wake of
other watercraft, and undertow can all be dangerous for your dog — a canine life
vest is essential in case of emergency. And because you never know when an emer-
gency may strike, put the vest on your dog while you’re still on dry land, and keep it
on him until he’s safely back.
When you can’t have your hands on your dog, he should be securely contained
either below deck or within a seating area where he can’t get his feet up on the side
rails or put his nose over the side. He’ll appreciate the wind in his nose, but salt-
water won’t be as pleasant.

bedience training helps you and your mixed-breed
dog communicate. It helps the two of you form a
bond — a pack of two. Plus, it increases the likelihood that
your dog will remain with you throughout his entire life,
because he’ll learn how to follow the house rules and
listen to you.
In this part, I cover everything from housetraining (the
most important training of all) to basic commands like sit,
stay, heel, and come. I also ﬁll you in on what to do if you
and your dog have encountered some training challenges,
and I give you tips on ﬁnding a professional trainer to

E
veryone who gets a new dog must immediately begin working
on the most important task: housetraining. Whether you got
your dog at a shelter or from a breeder, whether she’s a Heinz 57 or
a Labradoodle, the techniques are the same, and I fill you in on the
basics in this chapter.
But before you can teach your dog when and where to relieve her-
self, you need to recognize when she’s telling you that she has go.
In this chapter, I show you how to read your dog’s body language,
recognize her warning signs, and reward her at the appropriate
moments.
In this chapter, you discover how a crate can help you train 
your dog, whether she’ll have access to a yard or stay indoors.
Speaking of indoor dogs, I let you know how you can train your 
dog to do her business in a designated place inside. I also cover
creating a schedule so that your dog will know when she’ll have a
chance to go. As you schedule your dog’s relief times, you’ll also
teach your dog to potty on command, and in the specific location
that you want.
Finally, a large part of housetraining is preventing accidents. I help
you do exactly that, so your dog has more successes than failures
and gets through housetraining with straight A’s.

When You Gotta Go: Looking for
Your Dog’s Warning Signs
Dogs rarely just squat and potty out of the blue. Your dog will
always do something specific prior to letting loose. As you hang
out with your dog, look for sniffing, circling, whining, or sitting and
staring as she wonders why you can’t understand that she really
needs to go out now. Here’s some more of what to expect with each
of these common warning signs:
 Sniffing: The sniffing dog is the toughest to detect, because
dogs are always sniffing in their quest for something edible or
fun to play with. Believe it or not, there will be a pattern. Your
dog may sniff in a circle. Or she may sniff to detect a specific
spot in the house where she had an accident recently.
(Cleaning the entire smell off carpet or other flooring is nearly
impossible, so it’s a good bet that your dog will aim for the
same area when she has to go again.)
 Circling: Circling is an easier behavior to notice than sniffing
is. Unless they’re arranging their sleeping place, dogs rarely
move in circles. They prefer to go straight toward a person,
other animal, or toy. The classic potty circles are usually small
in circumference and are normally accompanied by sniffing.
When your dog is getting ready to sleep, she won’t sniff while
she circles, so if you see the two behaviors together, you
know what’s coming!
 Whining: The whining dog is, for all intents and purposes,
verbalizing her need to potty. A dog who whines when she 
has to go out is a really smart dog, because she realizes that
humans respond faster to sound than to body language (like
sniffing and circling). Your dog may sit and stare at you as 
she whines, or she may go to the door and whine. Either way,
she’s telling you she needs to go potty. No matter how you
look at it, a dog can’t make her wishes any clearer than she
can by whining.
 Sitting and starting: If your dog silently sits and stares at you,
she may eventually give up and go potty directly in front of
you. In the beginning stages of housetraining your pup, this
behavior isn’t necessarily a sign of disrespect. Your dog is
merely defining herself. She tried to tell you, and you didn’t
listen. Next time, if your dog sits and stares at you, get her
outside.
Part III: Training 101 
118

If your older dog (older than 6 months of age) has a good idea of
where to do her business and she happens to urinate or defe-
cate directly in front of you, this may be a sign of disrespect.
Essentially, your dog is marking her territory directly in front of
you, challenging your authority. If your dog is completely house-
trained and she does this, she needs obedience training —
pronto! (See Chapter 11 for more on obedience training.)
Some dogs prefer to potty in private. If your dog falls into this cate-
gory, she’ll try to do so by leaving the room or going behind furni-
ture. Later, you’ll find out what your dog’s been up to, but by then
it’s too late to do anything besides clean it up. If you’ve experi-
enced this, keep closer tabs on her. When she leaves the room,
follow her. If she heads for the same place as before, take her to
her potty area immediately.
Scheduling Potty Breaks
The best way to teach your dog when and where to relieve herself
is to be consistent with her relief times. A dog who knows when
she’ll have access to the relief area will learn to contain herself
until those allotted times. In fact, figuring out when your mixed
breed has to go, and what she has to do when she goes, will help
both of you. You’ll know what she needs to do and when. And
she’ll know that she has the opportunity to do her business in the
correct place and that she’ll be rewarded for doing so.
The schedule that’s right for you and your dog will depend not only
on what your dog needs to do, but also on your daily routine. If
you’re away from home most of the day, you may want to hire a dog
walker or place your dog in a securely fenced area with fresh water
and shelter — a place where she can have access to a potty zone.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 119
Playtime and potty time: 
They go hand in hand
If you have kids, doggie accidents are even more likely than they are in a home with-
out kids. Accidents tend to happen more when the kids come home from school or
the family is together on the weekend. Why? Because there is more commotion and
the adults tend not to pay as much attention to whether the dog needs to go out.
Also, the more active your dog, the more often she needs to potty.
Remember: Playtime is a high activity time for your dog, so keep a closer eye on her
and watch for those gotta-go signs.

Regardless of your work hours, your mixed-breed dog can adapt 
to your schedule. You just have to give her some guidance along
the way.
If you work away from home all day
Working for a living is a fact of life for most people, and if you’re
among the many who work outside the home, your dog will have to
adjust to your being away. You need to give her a realistic schedule
for feeding and potty breaks. The younger the dog, the more often
you’ll need to schedule her relief times.
Here’s a sample schedule. Use this in devising your own schedule
to fit your needs:
6 a.m.
Relief time. After holding it all night, your dog
will need to relieve herself. She should do her
business fairly quickly, allowing you to teach
her to potty on command (see the “Training
your dog to potty on command” section, later
in this chapter).
6:15 a.m.
Feed.
7 a.m.
Take your dog to her relief zone.
7:45 a.m.
Before leaving for work, take your dog to her
relief area again.
7:45 a.m.–
If your mixed-breed dog is new to your house-
6 p.m.
hold, she should be contained in a safe area —
such as a crate, pen, or fenced yard — while
you’re gone.
6 p.m.
As soon as you return home, take your dog to
her relief area. 
6:15 p.m.
Feed.
7 p.m.
Relief time.
8:30 p.m.
Relief time
10 p.m.
Just before going to bed, take your dog to her
relief area.
If your dog is younger than 4 months of age, she should be taken to
her relief area:
 Within 15 minutes after eating
 Directly after getting up from a nap
Part III: Training 101 
120

 During playtime
 After each training session
She should also be taken every hour to hour and a half. Waiting
longer is setting her up for an accident.
If you work out of your house
You may be home, but you’re busy, without the ability to con-
stantly tend to your dog. Although you can take her to her relief
area more often, which is great if your mixed-breed dog is very
young, you may not have time to do so every hour. Scheduling her
relief times is just as important as it would be if you worked away
from home.
Here’s a sample schedule to help you in setting up your own:
6 a.m.
Take your dog to her relief zone as soon as
you get up in the morning.
6:15 a.m.
Feed.
7 a.m.
Take your dog to her relief zone.
Throughout 
Try to take your dog to her relief area every 
the day
two to three hours (every one to one and a
half hours if she’s under 4 months old).
Remember: If, at any time, you can’t keep a
close eye on your dog, contain her as
described in the preceding section.
5 p.m.
Feed.
5:15 p.m.
Take your dog to her relief zone.
Throughout 
the evening
The more activity there is in the evening, the
more often your dog needs to be taken to her
relief area.
10 p.m.
Take her to her relief zone one last time, just
before bedtime.
If your schedule changes frequently
Changing the relief schedule for your dog will be as difficult as it is
for you — maybe more so. You can go to the bathroom anytime
you want, but your dog has to wait for you to take her.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 121

Try to develop a potty schedule for your dog that’s as consistent
as possible, even if your own schedule changes. You may want to
get help from a friend, family member, or neighbor to be sure your
dog can stick to her normal schedule.
Dogs are creatures of habit — taking away or constantly changing
something in a dog’s routine will create anxiety.
If you must be away for an extended period of time, make arrange-
ments with someone to come and take your dog to her relief area
every four hours.
Crate-Training to Prevent
Accidents
If your dog is new to your household, if she’s young, or if she has
behavioral issues, you’ll need to keep her in a safe area when you
can’t be with her. Restricting her access to your entire house will
not only prevent her from destroying your home but also keep her
from getting hurt. Containment also teaches your dog to contain
her need to potty, because a dog who remains still is less likely to
have to relieve herself than one who is moving around a lot.
This “safe zone” is commonly a crate, but it can also be a fenced
yard or a large pen. Regardless of where you contain your dog,
make sure she has shelter from the weather and fresh water at 
all times.
Shelter from the weather doesn’t just mean a roof. Some breeds
(like Boxers, Greyhounds, and other breeds with short coats) are
very sensitive to extreme temperatures; if your dog is a mix of
these breeds, be sure to provide her with a temperature-controlled
environment where she won’t overheat in the summer or get too
cold in the winter.
If you have a fenced yard, install a doggie door to the basement or
kitchen. Place an exercise pen just inside the door so that your dog
can come inside to escape the weather but won’t have free access
to your home.
How the crate works
Many people mistakenly believe that crates are cruel. But unless
they’re abused by being forced into the crate or left there for long
periods of time, most dogs don’t think so. Crates simulate dens, and
Part III: Training 101 
122

dogs like dens because they feel safe inside. The feeling of some-
thing solid all around gives them a sense of security. If you intro-
duce the crate to your dog positively, she’ll be happy to stay inside
while sleeping or go inside whenever she wants a little privacy.
Because most dogs remain still or sleep while they’re in their
crates, they’re less likely to have to relieve themselves. Crates also
help teach control while indoors. The crate is a place where your
dog can safely reside when you can’t watch her. Plus, few dogs will
potty in their crates, especially if the crate is the right size (big
enough for the dog, but not so big that she can potty at one end
and sleep far away in the other).
Most wild dogs build dens as a safe place to sleep or whelp puppies.
Instinctually, they never mess in their dens — they always leave the
enclosure to do their business in the surrounding area, not only as a
means of relief but also as a way to mark their territory.
Crating is a great way to help with housetraining. Let’s say you
take your dog outside to potty, but she’s too distracted to relieve
herself. After ten minutes, you bring her back inside, place her in
her crate for 30 minutes, and try again. She’ll probably have to
relieve herself after that half-hour is up. Then you can praise and
reward her for going in the correct location instead of being pun-
ished for relieving herself in the house.
Crating expedites the housetraining process and prevents acci-
dents, preventing constant negativity between you and your dog.
Never leave your dog locked in her crate for more than four to five
hours at a time. She needs to stretch her legs, potty, and exercise.
If you’re going to be gone longer than four or five hours, consider a
safely fenced area or ask a friend to let her out several times while
you’re away.
Introducing your dog to the crate
You want your dog to have positive associations with her crate, 
so the first rule to keep in mind is: Never use the crate as a place of
punishment. Your dog should feel safe and happy in her crate; she
should never be forced into it.
Begin by placing the crate in an area where you spend much of
your time, such as the kitchen, family room, office, or bedroom.
Put a comfortable doggie bed inside, along with a couple of toys
and fresh water.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 123

Use a small water bucket with a double-sided clip, and attach the
bucket to the wall of the crate. This will prevent your dog from tip-
ping over the water when she gets excited.
To introduce your dog to the crate, sit on the floor near the crate.
Allow your dog to sniff the crate and go in if she wants. After your
dog has become familiar with the crate, you can start training her
to go into the crate on command. Here’s how:
1. When you have your dog’s attention, throw a treat or fun
toy into the crate.
2. When your dog follows the reward into the crate, praise
her and give her another reward.
3. Allow your dog to come out of the crate as she pleases.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 several times until your dog is
anticipating and going in the crate on her own.
5. Close the door of the crate while your dog is inside eating
her treats.
6. Praise her and stick more treats through the crate so 
that your dog sees that she gets nice things when she
stays inside.
7. After 2 minutes, open the door of the crate and let your
dog come out if she chooses.
8. Repeat Steps 5 through 7, gradually increase the amount
of time the crate door is closed while your dog is con-
stantly being rewarded, until she relaxes comfortably for
five minutes.
9. Repeat Steps 5 and 6, but instead of standing by the
crate, give her a treat and briefly leave the room while
your dog remains closed in her crate.
10. Peek around a corner and continually praise your dog.
11. Return to the room, give her a reward, and open the
crate door.
12. Repeat Steps 9 through 11, gradually increasing the
amount of time you’re gone, always returning with many
rewards for your dog.
If your dog eats her treats quickly, offer a food-filled toy instead. A
hollow rubber ball, bone, or dental scrubber works well. You can
put treats inside or along the edges, so it takes longer for your dog
to finish — keeping her occupied for a longer period of time.
When you’re home, leave the crate door open so that your dog can
go in and out as she pleases.
Part III: Training 101 
124

As you’re gearing up to leave your dog in her crate for several
hours at a time, you’ll need to start small in order to assure her
she won’t be stuck in there forever. Begin with being away from
home only ten minutes. Peek in the windows and check on her. If
she’s happily playing with her toys or sleeping, return and reward
her. If she’s showing anxiety, back up a bit and return to remaining
home and peeking around the corner or to wherever she was com-
fortably relaxed.
Never be afraid to regress a little — doing so offers your dog a safe
zone where she’s comfortable, and it prevents creating a dog with
anxieties about being in the crate.
Teaching your dog to go 
in a specific area
Is your yard filled with doggie landmines? Does it have a polka
dotted patina? Maybe you’d like to have your dog do her business
in some out-of-the-way place so that nobody accidentally steps in it.
You can teach your dog to potty in one specific area. It can be at
the edge of a wooded area, a section of your yard, or somewhere
along your walks that is more appropriate than in the middle of the
sidewalk.
This won’t magically happen, however. You have to train your dog
to do it through encouragement and rewards. You must also make
the area attractive to your dog. The surface material needs to
easily maintain a scent, be soft enough to scratch at, and be near
enough to quickly reach.
Young puppies can’t hold it long enough to make it down the back
stretch. You may want to begin their housetraining by allowing
them to potty a little closer to home. After they have the idea of
relieving themselves outdoors, you can gradually increase the 
distance from the house.
Dogs prefer to relieve themselves where they can smell the scent
of other dogs. Some dogs also like to leave their own scent through
scratching at the ground. As they scratch, they release their scent,
covering the odor of the dog who previously visited. Taking your
mixed breed to a location where she can catch a whiff of another
dog will improve the chances that she’ll get her business done
quickly.
You can make sure that your dog understands where she must go
to relieve herself in a few ways. Be sure to accompany her there.
Walk her on the leash to the location, then let her sniff and move
Chapter 10: Housetraining 125

around. Eventually, she’ll get the idea that this is where you want
her to go. Remember: Reward her the moment she goes — praise
and offer treats.
Eventually, you won’t need to take your dog to the location on-
leash. You can run there, coaxing her to follow. As she relieves her-
self, praise and treat or throw a toy.
It may take some time to establish the relief spot. You’ll need to 
be patient and persistent. Also, watch your dog at all times. If she
starts to show the signs of needing to potty in the wrong place,
quickly guide her to the correct place. One accident in the wrong
location will leave a scent, making it more difficult to guide her
away from that area in the future.
Teaching your dog to get 
it done faster
Are you tired of waiting and waiting for your dog to do her busi-
ness? Your dog may not care that the weather is uncomfortable —
she’s more interested in the ground odors or the other dogs play-
ing nearby. Why waste a perfectly good opportunity to say hello to
someone?
This is where teaching your dog to relieve herself faster will be
very beneficial. Moreover, it totally coincides with all the other
things you’re doing to housetrain your mixed breed. After all,
wouldn’t you rather she potty within a couple minutes instead 
of an hour?
You can speed things along in several ways:
 Make sure your dog really has to go when you take her out.
If you stick to a specific schedule, you’ll know for sure what
she has to do and when.
 Every time you take your dog to her relief zone and she pot-
ties, give her a reward the moment she finishes. Most dogs
want their rewards so much that they’ll quickly do their busi-
ness just so they can get that reward faster.
 If your dog won’t potty within five minutes, return her to
her crate for a half-hour, and then try again. Repeat this
until she does go. As soon as she relieves herself, give her a
reward.
In less than a week, your dog will not only be letting you know
when she has to relieve herself, she’ll also do so on command
within a short period of time (see the following section).
Part III: Training 101 
126

Other Training Methods
If you live in a high-rise apartment building, you may decide to
paper-train your dog so you’re not always having to wait for the
elevator and hit the pavement before your dog does her business.
If paper-training doesn’t appeal to you, you can also train your dog
to use a litter pan, as cats do.
The procedures are basically the same as when teaching a dog to
relieve herself outside:
 When not in a safely contained area, observe your dog at 
all times.
 Watch for those behavioral signs that it’s time to potty.
 Immediately take your dog to that spot (the paper or litter pan).
 Reward her when she does her business.
In the following sections, I go into some more detail on both of
these methods.
Paper training
Paper is the usual surface cover of choice for indoor potty spots. 
A variety of products are available to create a specific potty zone
for your little mixed-breed dog. Potty pads with plastic on one side
and an absorbent surface on the other are readily available and
very convenient, because they’re easy to dispose. Some potty pads
are treated with a scent to entice your dog to use them.
Some potty pads also come with a plastic holder that you can use
to hold the potty pads in place. Not only does this keep the pads
spread out for easy use, but it also offers a surface different from
the regular floor, so your dog sees a difference between the potty
zone and the remainder of your house.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 127
Home alone
If you have an indoor dog, you can’t offer her a fenced yard to play in while you’re
gone. But she still needs to be confined to a space smaller than your entire home.
To set your little mixed-breed dog up for success, in both the housetraining and
overall manners categories, confine her in an exercise pen that contains her bed,
toys, water, and potty pad or litter box. This area will give her enough space to move
around during the day, a place to rest, and her potty zone.

Where you put the potty zone depends largely on the design of
your home. If you have many different rooms, you may want to
consider several potty zones. I recommend putting each zone on a
hard floor, not carpeting. If your dog misses and some of her urine
splashes onto the carpet, she may miss more often — on purpose,
because the scent is there.
Using a litter pan
Dogs really love to dig, so you may want to use a litter pan instead
of paper. The pan may be more enticing to your dog because she
can potty in a more natural way.
Litter allows your dog to step onto a totally different surface from
normal household flooring, making the potty zone very distinct
from the rest of the house. Because pans tend to have high sides,
your dog will be able to discern her relief area faster than a surface
that might be close to the floor.
Another advantage to this method is that the litter will soak up
“the urine, clumping it together for easy disposal (if you get the
clumping kind of litter). It can also coat the feces for similar ease 
of disposal. Plus, the scent remains in the pan and doesn’t perme-
ate other parts of your home. Your dog can scratch at the litter,
leaving her scent as she chooses, making it even more attractive
for use the next time.
Watching for Success
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. This adage is
very meaningful in housetraining dogs. If you can prevent your 
dog from having accidents in the wrong place and guide her to the
areas she can relieve herself, you’ll improve your relationship with
your dog while forming lifelong good habits.
Nothing sours a relationship faster than constant frustration and
punishment. More dogs end up at shelters and rescue organizations
due to misbehavior than accidental breeding. The owners of these
dogs never took the time to guide them toward correct behavior.
Your dog can’t read your mind.
Preventing housetraining accidents is one of the most important
parts of the entire process. In the following sections, I help you
keep accidents to a minimum.
Part III: Training 101 
128

Observing your dog
If you observe your dog closely, you’ll figure out exactly which
visual cues your dog uses before she does her business. When you
recognize the signs, you’ll know when she needs to go.
When your dog is loose in the house, you need to be watching her.
Burying your head in a book or watching television will only serve
to create the very situation you’re trying to prevent — accidents in
the house. 
You need to keep your eyes on your dog. Engage her in play or
work with her on tricks. Keep her in the same room with you.
Have your dog wear a leash of at least 4 feet in length at all times. 
If she begins to leave the room, step on the leash and coax her to
return. Praise her when she makes the correct decision. This is
especially important for dogs who like to do their business in the
next room or behind the couch.
Giving freedom only 
when she earns it
One of the worst things you can do with a new dog is to allow her
total freedom of your home. Leaving your new dog alone, with free
roam of your house, is a setup for disaster for both of you. Your
dog will have an accident, and you’ll have to clean it up — plus,
you may get frustrated with her, which does nothing for the bond
that you’re trying to create.
Dogs need guidance. They thrive in a structured environment. Dogs
love following the rules. It gives them a sense of pack structure;
something very natural to their own instinctual behavior patterns.
Your dog has to earn everything she gets. Don’t allow your dog free
roam of your home if she hasn’t yet proved she can be trusted.
Getting to the point where you can trust your dog all over your
house, without being watched, may take anywhere from weeks to
months to years. It’s a long, ongoing process, but being cautious
and taking your time will reduce your own frustration and improve
your dog’s understanding of what you want.
Never allow your dog any freedom within your home without first
making sure she has done her business.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 129

The initial stages of freedom go hand in hand with close observa-
tion. Don’t allow your dog to go where she wants without your
being close behind. This way you can see any warning signs and
whisk her to her relief area quickly. You can also prevent other
types of problems such as chewing on the couch or eating some-
thing dangerous.
Begin allowing your dog to areas of the house other than her
normal containment area by walking with her. Have her heeling 
at your side. Practice stays (see Chapter 11) in every room. Then
allow her some free time to explore under your close supervision.
This will teach her manners in all parts of the house.
As your dog learns to behave and contain herself in her one area,
you can gradually allow her free access to other areas. For example,
you begin with containing her in the kitchen. She has no accidents
in the kitchen for several weeks. You can then offer her free access
to the breakfast area along with the kitchen. As she proves herself
worthy of more freedom, allow her more access to your house.
You can use baby gates to help cordon off specific rooms. Baby
gates also keep your dog safely within her containment area with-
out shutting her off from the rest of the house in a negative way,
making her feel ostracized from her family pack (which, to a dog, 
is punishment).
Working on Some Advanced
Housetraining Techniques
After your dog is housetrained (meaning, she knows where to go
and she’s not having accidents in the house), you can take it up a
notch and get her to go potty on command, as well as ring a bell 
to let you know when has to go out. Pretty nifty, huh?
Training your dog to potty 
on command
Wouldn’t it be great if you could teach your dog to come and tell
you when she needs to relieve herself? And wouldn’t it be great if
she did her business the minute she got into her potty zone — a
location that you’d prefer she use? The good news is, all this can
happen. You just have to be persistent and consistent with your
dog, and she’ll aim to please you.
Part III: Training 101 
130

Begin by deciding on one specific word that you’ll use as a cue,
such as hurry, potty, business, or empty. When you take your dog to
her potty spot, say the word repeatedly until she actually relieves
herself. When she is in the middle of relieving herself, say in a
cheerful voice, “Good potty!”, or whatever word you’ve chosen to
use. When she’s done, praise and give her a reward. Your dog will
realize that her actions earn rewards, and dogs tend to repeat the
behaviors that are rewarding. Most dogs pick up on the verbal cue
very quickly. Usually within three days to a week.
You may want to choose a word that won’t embarrass you in
public. I’ve always used the words hurry or go. They’re far less
embarrassing than the word potty or the words for the bodily func-
tions. Picture yourself standing in a crowded park with your dog.
Would you rather say, “Pee-pee! Pee-pee!” or “Hurry! Hurry!”? I’m
bettin’ on the latter.
When you follow one of the schedules discussed earlier in the
chapter, you can easily use a specific word to cue your dog to
potty, especially during the first morning relief times and whenever
you’ve just let her out of her crate and taken her to her potty zone.
One of the best results of having a dog who potties on command is
during travel. Stopping at a roadside table, rest area, or service sta-
tion; taking your dog to a small grassy area; and giving the com-
mand is far easier and faster than having to walk your dog around
for a long time, hoping that she’ll find just the right spot.
You rang? Getting your dog to ring 
a bell when she has to go
Earlier in the chapter, I cover some of the common warning signs
that your dog may have to do her business. But you can bridge the
language gap and teach your mixed breed a way of telling you that
she has to go out, in a way you both understand. You can teach her to
ring a bell to let you know she needs to relieve herself. (Be sure she
knows how to potty on command before you train her to use a bell.
She has to be able to go on command for the bell training to work.)
Several types of bells work well. Jingle bells and cow bells work
nicely because their sounds are loud and clear.
Here’s how to train your dog to ring a bell when she has to go out:
1. Hang the bell on the knob of the door leading to your
dog’s relief area.
Chapter 10: Housetraining 131

2. Place a small piece of cheese, some peanut butter, or
some canned dog food on the bell.
3. Coax your dog to the door and move the bell a little to
get your dog’s attention.
4. Chances are, she already noticed you putting the food on
the bell and she’s eagerly waiting to lick it off.
5. When your dog goes for the food, she’ll likely move the
bell, making it ring.
6. As soon as the bell rings, open the door and take your
dog to her relief area.
7. Cue her to relieve herself.
8. Praise and reward her the moment she potties.
Your mixed-breed dog should be ringing the bell on her own within
a week or less. Just make sure that you can hear the sound when
your dog is loose in the house, or she just might think that you still
don’t understand her and she needs to do her business near the
door, trying to clarify her needs.

P
art of owning a dog — and ensuring that you’re both happy —
is training him. A good training regimen goes hand in hand with
overall character development, good behavior, and communication.
Plus, it’s fun!
In this chapter, I give you all the tools you’ll need to train your
mixed breed from start to finish — from the equipment you need
to the basic commands to finding a trainer to help you.
Preparing for Training
Lots of people get frustrated with training their dogs because they
haven’t done some of the prep work. They just say “Sit,” shove
their dog’s butt to the ground, and expect him to know what that
means. If you spend just a little time getting ready to train, you’ll
be setting yourself — and your mixed breed — up for success!
In this section, I cover a few categories of preparation: targeting,
using a clicker, and buying the right equipment.
Targeting: The first step in training
Have you ever gone to an aquarium and watched a dolphin or
whale show? Did you see the sea mammals jump up and touch a

big ball on the end of a long stick? That ball was called a target, and
you can do the same kind of thing with your dog. Okay, so he won’t
jump 20 feet out of a pool of water, but he’ll do plenty of exciting
tricks of his own.
Don’t believe me? Consider this: When you give your dog a treat,
does he look at your hand? That’s a target, too. A dog who watches
your hand when you have a treat in it is a dog who will learn to
respond to visual cues.
Targeting quickly teaches your dog what you want him to do.
When you motion him to sit, he looks at your target (your hand)
and sits. When you motion him to lay down (by dropping your
hand downward), his nose and body will follow into position.
Here’s how to begin targeting:
1. Place a small bit of food in your hand.
When targeting, use a piece of food that has a strong smell,
such as freeze-dried liver, cheese, or chicken. The enticing
scent will instantly grab your dog’s attention.
2. Put your hand near your mixed-breed dog’s nose, and
allow him to sniff.
3. When he puts his nose on your hand he is targeting —
give him the food!
Using a marker: The second 
step in training
Though targeting will get your dog started on paying attention, you
need a means of letting your mixed breed know that he’s doing what
you want. You need to offer a specific sound or movement to coin-
cide with the exact moment your mixed breed does what you’ve
asked. This is called marking, and marking is usually done with the
use of a clicker, a squeaker, or a specific word said in an enthusiastic
tone of voice. The key is that the sound must be distinct from all
other sounds your dog is likely to hear. For this reason, a clicker
(available from most pet shops) may be your best bet.
Here’s how to teach your dog to understand a marker:
1. Begin by targeting (see the preceding section) except
when your dog puts his nose on your hand, instead of
giving him a treat, use your marker.
2. Then give your mixed breed a treat.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 three to five times.
Part III: Training 101 
134

You can bring together the concepts of targeting and marking.
Here’s how:
1. Show your mixed breed your hand holding the treat.
2. Move your hand to the left.
3. When he moves his head to the left, mark and reward.
4. Move your hand to the right.
5. When your mixed breed moves his head to the right,
mark and reward.
When your mixed breed understands the way to earn easy treats,
it’s time to start making him work a little harder. Make him do
more to earn his rewards — for example, move his head from side
to side or up and down before you mark and reward. This is called
chaining, because it’s chaining together several behaviors prior to
marking the moment when your mixed breed has done what you
asked. Chaining is a very important part of obedience training —
you don’t want to give your mixed breed a treat for every single
correct response to commands. If you do, you’ll have a very fat
dog in no time!
Buying the right training tools
So many tools, so little time! With all the collars, leashes, harnesses
and other paraphernalia, how will you know what’s right for your
mixed breed?
The collar your dog wears while he’s lounging around the house
isn’t the collar you’ll want to use when you’re training. Here’s a
breakdown of which collars I recommend for training:
 Gentle Leader Easy Walk Harness: The Easy Walk Harness is
a great training device for young dogs, small dogs, and dogs
who don’t tend to pull hard at any time. You attach the leash
to the front ring (at the dog’s chest). When the dog moves
ahead, you turn and pull the leash to the side opposite where
your dog is heading. Dogs acclimate quickly to this device.
 Head halter (such as Comfort Trainer and Halti): Head hal-
ters are great for dogs who pull, especially when they’re dis-
tracted. They’re also great for dominant dogs who feel it’s
their duty to lead you. Several brands of head halter are on
the market, but the ones I recommend are Comfort Trainer
and Halti, because they don’t put pressure on the dog’s nose
unless you apply it to get your dog’s attention.
The type of leash you use when you train your dog is very impor-
tant. You want to use one that’s right for your mixed breed.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 135

Never use an extendable/retractable leash — whether you’re train-
ing or not! These leashes teach your dog to pull, because the
leashes are constantly trying to retract as your dog moves away
from you. You want to teach your dog to pay attention and remain
at your side, so this is the last thing you need.
The leash that’s right for your dog has a lot to do with your dog’s
weight. Here’s a breakdown:
 10 pounds or less: A light nylon or cotton leash no more than
1⁄4-inch wide, with a very small clip.
 11–25 pounds: A leather or cotton leash no more than 1⁄2-inch
wide with a small clip.
 26–55 pounds: A leather or cotton leash no more than 1⁄2-inch
wide with a medium clip.
 56 pounds or more: A leather leash no more than 5⁄8-inch wide
with a medium clip.
It’s not the clip that will keep the leash on your dog — it’s your
training method. When using a head halter, use a lightweight leash
so as not to apply any pressure to your dog’s nose without your
needing to do so.
Making your voice and 
body work for you
Your dog will be watching everything you do and listening to every
sound you make. In order to make sense to your mixed breed, be
consistent with all your vocalizations and body language. This will
help him understand what you want.
Use three distinct vocal tones, depending on what you want to
communicate:
 Praise: A high, happy tone
 Command: A demanding, even tone
 Reprimand: A low tone
Your voice isn’t the only way you communicate. Your dog also
picks up on your body language. The bigger you make yourself, the
more your mixed breed will pay attention and listen to your com-
mands. The smaller you make yourself, the less he’ll respond to
your commands. The reason: A dominant dog will make himself
look bigger, and a submissive dog will make himself look smaller.
Most dogs won’t listen to someone they feel superior to. But they
will respond quickly to someone they respect.
Part III: Training 101 
136

When giving a command, stand up straight, as shown in Figure 11-1.
When rewarding or greeting your dog, crouch down, as shown in
Figure 11-2.

Figure 11-2: Crouch down when rewarding or greeting your dog.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 137

Heel
Heeling means that your dog is at your side, shoulder even with
your leg. He can walk on your left or your right, whichever is most
comfortable for you.
Most professional trainers and those who show dogs keep the dog
on the left; in this chapter, I address the training techniques assum-
ing that you’ll be teaching your mixed-breed dog to work on your
left side, too.
The method you use for teaching your mixed-breed dog to heel
depends on his age, size, and how easily distracted he might be. A
young pup, for example, should be started either off-leash, or with 
a light leash dragging from a harness or flat neck collar. A dog older
than 4 months old will need a training device, such as an Easy Walk
Harness, with a light leash attached and held in your right hand. A
dog over 4 months with high reactivity needs a head halter.
Getting started: The basics of Heel
Start by holding the leash loop in your right hand along with your
clicker (if you’re carrying one). Have a pouch filled with treats
clipped on to your jeans or tied around your waist. Hold a treat 
in your left hand — your target hand.
Get your mixed breed’s attention by targeting and marking (see
earlier in this chapter). When he’s paying attention to you, hold
your left hand (target hand) on your left thigh. Your mixed breed
will move closer to your left thigh, which is heel position. Both of
you will be facing the same direction.
Take a step forward as you say your mixed breed’s name and the
command, “Heel” or “Let’s go” in a commanding tone of voice (see
Figure 11-3). Remember: You don’t need to be loud — dogs hear
far better than humans do. Demand, don’t ask.
Because the target went forward a bit as you took a step, your
mixed breed is likely to follow along, his nose on your hand. As 
he moves with you, mark after his correct response and reward.
The next time, take two steps, then three, then four, and so on until
your mixed breed is walking with you across the yard or down the
sidewalk, nose on your left hand the whole way.
Part III: Training 101 
138

Figure 11-3: Have your dog target on your hand as you take a step forward.
The best means of ensuring your dog knows you are giving him a
command is to precede it with his name. Use a happy tone when
saying his name so that he’ll have positive associations when hear-
ing it. In the beginning, it’ll help to give him rewards every time he
looks at you when you say his name.
If your mixed-breed dog begins to move ahead of you, it means one
of two things:
 You’ve walked farther than he’s ready for. To remedy this
situation, just decrease the number of steps you take between
marking and rewarding.
 He no longer thinks that the treats are as valuable as that
squirrel he sees climbing a nearby tree. If this is the case,
the moment you see his ears in front of your left leg, turn 
right and make a total 180-degree turn, without looking at 
or waiting for him.
If your mixed breed moves off to your right — say, something
grabs his attention on that side, or he smells something in your
right hand — turn left. As soon as you make that 180-degree turn 
to the left, he’s back on your left side watching you. Mark his good
behavior, stop, and give him a small piece of treat.

Part III: Training 101

When you’re having trouble getting 
your dog’s attention
Of all the obedience exercises in which you might be using a head halter, heeling
differs the most from using any other training device. You may pull a bit with a body
harness or flat collar — you don’t do that with a head halter. A head halter is on the
dog’s head, so if you pull back, you’re turning your dog’s head and straining his neck.
The best way to regain your dog’s attention while walking is to gently pull down-
ward as you turn right (see the figure). This will turn your dog’s head toward you
while also making his body follow along — without causing neck strain or injury.
Pulling down with a head halter does several things:
 It grabs your dog’s attention quickly in a way he understands.
 It causes your dog to be submissive to you as you press on his nose.
 It brings his entire body around to where you are.

Trying the Heel off-leash
When you and your mixed breed are walking along nicely, you can
begin doing so off-leash indoors or within a small, securely fenced
area where there are no distractions.
Working off-leash is generally the ultimate goal of many dog
owners. It takes lots of time and energy, but it is possible. I’ve
broken this difficult process into two phases.
You know you’re ready to begin off-leash heeling when you hardly
have to use the leash at all. You can accomplish this by varying
your pace, performing quick 180-degree turns, and never stopping
to see what your mixed breed is up to if he’s lagging behind.
The more turns you do, the more attentive your dog.
Phase 1: Dragging the leash
While you’re walking, your mixed breed should be watching 
you attentively and keeping pace with you. If he’s doing so 
nonchalantly, drop your leash. If your dog moves a little ahead, 
you can quickly step on the leash with a verbal reminder that 
he’s not paying attention. This should be enough to return your
mixed breed to your side and resume watching you — if not, 
return to the previous phase and work a little longer before 
trying this again.
Phase 2: Using a pull-tab leash
A pull-tab leash (shown in Figure 11-4) is a very short leash
attached to the training device (at this point the training device
should be a flat collar, because your dog no longer needs to be
physically redirected).
Begin walking with a light hold on the end of the pull tab. As your
mixed breed remains attentively at your side in heel position, let
go. Keep a close eye on your dog. If he begins to stray out of posi-
tion, use a verbal reminder in a low tone of voice as you make a
sharp turn. If your dog goes in any direction other than with you,
he wasn’t ready for this phase. Return to leash dragging until you
no longer have to step on the leash or use any reminders about
remaining in heeling position.
Otherwise, congratulations! Your dog now heels off-leash.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 141

Figure 11-4: A pull tab should be 
attached to the flat neck collar and 
hang no longer than your dog’s chest.
Sit
Having your dog sit on command is very important in many 
situations:
 He should sit for attention.
 He should sit prior to being fed.
 He should sit at your side when you stop walking.
Here’s how to teach your dog to sit:
1. Begin with a treat in your hand and target with your
mixed-breed dog (see earlier in this chapter).
2. When he puts his nose on your hand, mark and reward.
Part III: Training 101 
142

3. To lure your mixed-breed dog into a sitting position place
your target hand between his eyes, just out of reach of
his mouth, but not out of reach of his nose.
Be sure to not hold it so high above his head that he feels
as though he must jump up to reach it.
4. As your mixed breed looks upward at his target, his rear
end will lower down. Mark and reward.
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 several times.
6. Add the verbal cue — your dog’s name and the command
Sit— as you place your target hand between his eyes.
This will teach him both your word for Sit and the visual
cue of your hand over his head.
When your mixed breed understands the Sit concept, add it into
your heeling routines and use it anytime you want him to stay in
one place for a little while. As you teach your mixed breed other
commands — such as Come and Stay — you’ll want to use this 
all-important Sit command as part of these requests.
Down
Teaching your mixed breed to lie down on command is very impor-
tant. Not only can he maintain this position for longer periods of
time than a Sit or Stand, but it also places your mixed breed in a
less-than-dominant position.
Because of this submissive positioning, many dogs prefer not to
listen to the Down command, so you’ll need to make sure you
approach it in a positive manner and enforce it using rewards. If
your mixed breed sees the Down as a way to get treats and belly
rubs, he’ll respond to your Down command with enthusiasm.
Before you begin, find out what your mixed breed loves above all
other things. Is it a specific toy, a piece of steak, or a belly rub? 
Use this special reward to both lure him into the Down position
and keep him there for a few seconds.
Here’s how to train your dog to follow the Down command:
1. Begin with targeting your dog into the Sit (see the preced-
ing section). Mark and reward the moment he’s in position.
2. Place the special treat directly under your mixed 
breed’s nose.
3. As soon as he targets on it, lower the treat to the floor
(see Figure 11-5).
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 143

Figure 11-5: Lower the treat to the floor, and as soon as your dog lies down,
mark and reward.
4. As he follows with his head, mark and reward.
5. Repeat the exercise again, and don’t mark until he has
lowered himself a little more.
Eventually your mixed breed will lie down completely,
enabling you to reward him with a belly rub.
Your dog doesn’t have to go all the way into a down position for
you to reward his initial response of lowering his head. Some dogs
will go all the way, while more dominant dogs may be reticent to
do so. Offer your dog a chance at success in small increments.
Some dogs are so dominant that there is no treat in existence that
will get them to demean themselves by lying down at your will. This
type of dog needs some gentle assistance into the Down position —
but it shouldn’t be forceful or harsh. Here’s what to do:
1. Begin with your dog sitting in Heel position at your 
left side.
2. Try targeting him into the Down position with your 
right hand.
3. If he ignores your visual cue, place your left hand on 
his shoulders as you bring out his front feet with your
right hand.
4. Apply constant but gentle pressure to his shoulders as
you bring the front legs forward.
Part III: Training 101 
144

5. The moment your mixed breed’s tummy touches the
floor, rub his belly and praise.
If your mixed breed weighs more than 50 pounds, you’ll want to
unbalance him into the Down position. Check to see the side on
which he’s placing all his weight. (Hint: It’s the hip you see the
least of.) As you bring the front leg of that same side forward,
apply pressure to your dog’s shoulders on the opposite side,
thereby lowering your mixed breed onto his side as his tummy
meets the floor.
When your dog can perform both the Sit and Down on command,
you’ll be ready to teach him how to remain in these positions
through the following Stay exercises.
Stay
Your mixed breed needs to learn to remain in place while sitting,
lying down, and even while standing. The stand/stay is great while
being examined by a veterinarian or during grooming.
Though your mixed breed can stay for a short period of time in a
sit or stand, he can remain in position longer while lying down. For
example, a sit/stay is great while looking both ways prior to cross-
ing a street, or while greeting someone, but your mixed breed can’t
remain in that position more than a couple minutes without need-
ing to move. While in a down/stay, he can learn to remain in his
bed while you’re eating dinner, visiting with guests, watching tele-
vision, or allowing a young child to touch him.
There are three components to teaching a solid stay:
 Time
 Movement
 Distance
If you teach your mixed breed with this methodical technique, he’ll
learn to remain in place regardless of distractions or environmental
situations, such as at a dog park, when greeting a guest at the door,
or in the presence of other animals.
Time
Wouldn’t it be great if your mixed breed remained in the same
place for upwards of a minute? In this section, I show you how you
can get him to do exactly that.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 145

Begin by doing this in a sit/stay.
1. Have your dog heel and sit at your side.
Always begin a training session with something that your
dog knows well and will receive rewards for performing.
2. As your dog is sitting, target in front of his nose with one
hand as you use a specific visual cue with the other hand.
I always use an open-fingered hand, with the palm facing
the dog (see Figure 11-6).
3. Hold the target by your mixed breed’s nose for only a
couple seconds.
4. Mark and reward, then continue heeling.
Figure 11-6: Hold the hand target in the same position as you did with the Sit
target while giving the visual cue for stay.
With each successive Stay exercise, hold the target (and thus your
dog’s attentive sit/stay) a couple seconds longer.
The next step is to add the actual Stay command. Your mixed
breed already has an idea of your visual cues for the command, so
Part III: Training 101 
146

he’ll easily learn the verbal ones associated with your body lan-
guage. Say your dog’s name and the command “Stay” as you give
the hand signal in front of his face.
You don’t need to actually touch your dog’s nose with your visual
cue. Seeing it is enough. Also, don’t swing your hand toward his
face. He might flinch at the motion, making the entire learning
process less positive.
If your dog is getting up after a specific amount of time — for exam-
ple, after he’s been staying for 10 seconds — back up a bit (say, 
to 8 seconds). Work at this level for the remainder of the training
session. During the next session, after he’s been successfully stay-
ing for 8 seconds, try again for 10 seconds. Sometimes you’ll have
more success with an exercise if you’re willing to regress a bit to a
comfortable point.
When you’ve accomplished at least a 30-second sit/stay, do the
same exercise with the down/stay.
If your mixed breed has trouble remaining in position, even with
his target nearby, apply a light pressure to his shoulder blades 
any time he starts to push upward. This pressure will maintain 
his position without your having to replace him with another 
command or offering another treat.
Movement
Now that your mixed breed can remain in both the sit/stay and
down/stay positions, it’s time to move around him while he stays.
As with the time factor (see the preceding section), movement
should be done in small increments.
When moving around your dog in a sit/stay, begin by moving in
front of him. When moving around your dog in a down/stay, begin
by moving along his side and then behind him.
Here’s how to progress with a sit/stay:
1. Step directly in front of your mixed-breed dog as you
give the stay command (see Figure 11-7).
2. After remaining in front of your dog for up to 30 seconds,
return to the heeling position, mark his good behavior
and reward him.
3. Move side to side in front of your mixed breed as he
remains in his sit/stay.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 147

Figure 11-7: The first move during a sit/
stay should be directly in front of your dog, 
standing face to face and toe to toe.
4. When your mixed breed can maintain a sit/stay with you
moving in front of him, begin walking along his sides.
Be sure to go along both sides equally.
5. Walk completely around your dog as he stays.
As with moving along his sides, do your circles around him
in both directions.
Distance
The final step of the Stay exercise is to increase your distance as
you move around your dog. This will allow you to tell your mixed
breed to stay even if you’re not right by his side. You can do this
when you’re going to answer the door, when you’re walking
through gates, or when you’re going into one room and wanting
him to stay in another.
Part III: Training 101 
148

As with the movement part of this exercise (see the preceding 
section), increase your distance using small increments and 
always be ready to shorten your distance if your dog can’t remain
in place.
Begin with gaining 1 foot of distance as you move around your
mixed breed. When he proves reliable with this, go to 2 feet, and 
so on, until you’re walking around him at the end of a 6-foot leash.
When your mixed breed proves reliable at 6 feet, put on a 15- to 
20-foot leash and gradually increase the distance even more.
Increase distance gradually. Sudden distance will cause your dog
to move out of position.
Don’t move straight backward. Your mixed breed will have a ten-
dency to move toward you if you do this. Increase your distance 
as you move around him.
Come
Of all the obedience exercises, having your dog come when called
is probably the most important. Nothing is more frustrating than
calling your dog and seeing him run in the opposite direction. Your
mixed breed is not doing this because he’s vindictive — he just
doesn’t understand what you want.
If you’ve already taught your dog the commands earlier in this
chapter, you’re already well on your way to having your dog listen
to your Come command.
The basics
As with all new exercises, start by being very close to your mixed
breed so he’ll always be successful and see the come command as
very positive.
1. Say your dog’s name.
2. Mark and reward when he looks at you.
3. Repeat several times.
You’ll begin noticing a few things. First, your dog not only turns to
you, but he’s starting to come to you. Second, he’s doing so with-
out any force from you — he wants to come.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 149

Now start moving with the request:
1. Begin with targeting.
2. Back up a couple steps and have your mixed-breed 
dog target.
3. Back up a couple more steps and tell your mixed-breed
dog his name and the command Come as you back up.
4. Repeat until you can back up at least ten steps and your
dog is near your toes all the way.
Taking it up a notch: A game 
of Round Robin
After your dog has mastered the preceding exercises, it’s time to play
a game of Round Robin. This game is a great way to teach a young
dog to come when called. It’s also fun for older dogs and especially
great at teaching your mixed breed to listen to the entire family.
Before you begin, make sure that everyone who wants to play the
game does the earlier exercise of targeting and saying your dog’s
name. This teaches your mixed breed that he’s rewarded for listen-
ing to everyone, not just to you.
Here’s how to play:
1. Have everyone stand in a circle, about 8 feet from 
each other.
Your dog needs some space to move from person to person.
2. Lean forward, show your mixed breed the target, say 
his name, and tell him, “Come” in a very pleasant tone 
of voice.
3. As he moves toward you, praise enthusiastically the
entire time he’s coming.
4. As soon as he arrives, mark and reward.
If you’ve been using a clicker, everyone in the game must
have a clicker, too. If you’re using a verbal sound, make
sure everyone can emulate the sound.
5. Repeat Steps 2 through 4 with everyone in the group.
Alternate the order in which each person calls your mixed breed,
so he never knows what’s coming next.
Part III: Training 101 
150

You can vary this game by adding other command elements, such
as having your mixed breed sit when he arrives. Or have him lie
down. Then add a stay. This way, everyone in the family will be
giving him commands, and he’ll think it’s all a big game and loads
of fun to listen. After all, he’s earning loads of rewards and atten-
tion. What’s not to like?
Getting your dog to come 
from a Stay
Now that your mixed breed is readily coming from one person to
another and to you as you move backward, it’s time to try the
come from both the sit/stay and down/stay.
The most difficult part of this command is gathering the leash as
your dog nears you. If you don’t gather it, the leash gets entangled
under your mixed breed’s feet, and disentangling it after his arrival
is inconvenient for you (and annoying to your dog).
Try to gather your leash hand over hand as your dog comes to
you. Don’t pull on the leash — you want your mixed breed to come
when called without needing any force.
Here’s the step-by-step approach:
1. Place your dog in a Stay.
2. Lean forward, show him your hand target, hold the target
near your knees, and call him to you (see Figure 11-8).
3. As your dog comes to you, stand upright and gather your
leash hand over hand (see Figure 11-9).
Practice calling your mixed breed from all directions — in front of
him, from each side, and from behind him. This will teach him to
come from any direction. Also be sure to have your mixed breed
perform the come from both his sit/stay and down/stay positions.
The more you vary the exercises, the more attentive your mixed
breed will be.
Always begin with the former exercise of calling from the end of a
6-foot leash. But when your mixed breed is reliably responding,
you can attach a 15- to 20-foot leash and work from greater dis-
tances. Keep in mind that the longer the leash, the more you must
gather as your dog comes to you. Also, the farther away your dog
when you call him, the faster he’ll move toward you — often faster
than you can gather the leash! No worries: If your mixed breed
arrives before you can totally gather the leash, do the following:
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 151

1. Take hold of the leash near his collar, giving him at least
2 feet of slack between his collar and your hand.
2. Move into the heel position, allowing the leash to drag
behind your dog as you walk.
3. Gather the leash while you’re walking with your dog.
It will be easier to gather since your dog won’t be sitting on
part of it.
Figure 11-8: Keep your upper body low and target near your knees 
as you call your dog to you.
As with gaining distance on the Stay exercises, you want to build
on success with the recall as well. Begin with short distances and,
as your mixed breed becomes reliable, gradually increase the dis-
tance as you vary the location. Practice calling him to you from in
front of him, from either side, and from behind.
If you get to a specific distance and your mixed-breed dog is sniff-
ing on his way to you, go back to a shorter distance. Your mixed-
breed dog is showing you that he’s not ready for that distance yet.
Part III: Training 101 
152

Figure 11-9: As you gather your leash, move your upper body upright.
When your mixed breed is easily coming to you from the distance
of the long leash, it’s time to move away from the leash a bit. Here’s
how to do it in safe phases:
1. Drop the leash and move around your dog, but return to
the end of the leash prior to calling him.
This will allow you to pick up the leash and guide your
mixed breed to you if he gets distracted by something
along the way.
2. Call him from near the leash, but not in a direct line 
with it.
Again, this will allow you to reinforce your command 
fairly quickly if your mixed breed gets distracted by 
something else.
3. Move farther and farther from the line of the leash as
your mixed breed proves reliable.
4. Gain distance from your dog as he proves reliable from
any location.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 153

5. Hide behind solid objects so your dog learns to stay and
come when you’re out of sight.
You may want to have someone help you with this because
you won’t be able to see when your dog moves before you
call him.
Dealing with Distractions
Maybe your beautifully trained mixed breed does super when he’s
in your house or yard, but not so well walking down the road. But
what if you want to be able to go places with your dog and have
him still reliably follow your commands?
Your mixed-breed dog must learn how to behave regardless of
where he is and what’s going on around him. This is a very impor-
tant part of obedience work. Time for distraction-proofing!
Looking at the different 
levels of distraction
Every dog is an individual, and that isn’t more true than with a
mixed-breed dog. Some dogs are distracted by the smallest leaf;
others won’t react unless they see another dog coming toward
them. You’ve spent some time with your mixed breed, so you 
probably have a sense — or are starting to get one! — of what
grabs his attention.
The things that attract a dog’s attention do have some connection to
the dog’s breed. If you know your dog’s mix (or you can make an edu-
cated guess), check out the following and see if any of this rings true:
 Sporting: Smells of other animals, movement of small animals
or toys
 Hound: Smells and, for sighthounds, quick movements
 Working: Movement of other animals or toys, presence of a
dominant dog
 Terrier: The presence of squirrels, rabbits, cats, and other dogs
 Toy: Other dogs
 Non-Sporting: Just about anything — all of these breeds are
based on dogs from the other groups, so there’s no telling
what will distraction them
 Herding: Movement of other animal and young children
Part III: Training 101 
154

Although specific breeds (or breed mixes) have a tendency to react
more to one type of distraction than to another, a few generalizations
can be made about what is least likely to distract any dog and what is
most likely to distract. Here’s a list of the top-ten distractions, start-
ing with the least likely and ending with the most likely:
 Fallen leaves
 Toys lying around
 Toys being thrown around
 The presence of people
 People moving by quickly
 Children playing nearby
 Children running near and going by quickly
 Dogs barking in a nearby yard 
 Dog being walked nearby, especially if coming toward you
 Dog playing with a ball nearby
When working on distraction-proofing your dog, begin with the
things like fallen leaves and toys on the floor and gradually work
your way up to dogs walking or playing nearby.
Introducing distractions to your dog
Distraction-proofing is far more difficult than teaching the basic
commands. It’s tough for your dog to pay attention when he’d
rather be chasing squirrels, playing with other dogs or racing
around the schoolyard with all the children.
You have to offer your mixed breed a positive experience for him 
to want to work for you amid all these distractions. In order to
maintain his positive attitude, you must always have a positive out-
look and offer him high-value rewards so that paying attention to
you is more important to him than anything else. You’ll also need to
reward him very often, so that he has more desire to pay attention.
Be prepared to redirect your dog when there is a distraction too
enticing to ignore. Often treats or favorite toys can’t compete with
the presence of another dog, especially one playing nearby. Your
mixed-breed dog won’t care if you put a piece of steak under his
nose — he feels that the better reward is to go play with that other
dog. When this occurs, you need to be able to redirect him. You’ll
need training tools, namely the head halter.
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 155

Here’s the process:
1. Have your dog heeling at your side.
2. When you see the distraction, don’t react — save your
reaction for when your mixed-breed dog begins to look.
Don’t wait for your mixed breed to pull before you react. If
he even looks at the distraction, he’s distracted.
3. When your dog notices the distraction, pull downward
on your leash as you turn.
4. Continue walking until your dog is heeling properly.
5. Mark and reward.
6. Turn and try to get a little closer the next time.
Continue with your turning and redirection when your
mixed breed begins to look at the other dog. Always mark
the moment he returns to his correct behavior and reward
him for it.
If you’ve been trying to get just a couple feet closer than the previ-
ous attempt and your mixed breed simply won’t allow that, it’s
time to back off to a safer zone. For example, say you’ve been
working on getting within 20 feet of that yard where the dog is
barking and jumping on the fence, but your mixed breed wants to
lunge toward the other dog the moment he lays eyes on it. It’s time
to go back to the area where dog didn’t react so adamantly. Work
in this area for a while. Then, when your dog is calm and not
pulling to go toward the distraction, try to get just a few feet closer.
Helping your dog be 
reliable off-leash
Don’t attempt distraction-proofing off-leash until your dog is totally
reliable on-leash without your having to redirect, back off, or pull
on his collar. When you’re off-leash, you can’t control your dog’s
reaction. If he sees something enticing, he may not heed your
words of warning.
As you reach a point in your training when your mixed breed is
reliable on-leash, without any instances of having to redirect or
regress, try working around the distractions off-leash. Begin with
the items that are the least likely to cause him to react, such as
toys lying around, the presence of another person or child, or
someone moving around him. If he handles these well, try working
with him near a yard where there’s another dog. Finally, with all
Part III: Training 101 
156

the other distractions controlled, it’s time to attempt the most diffi-
cult: dog and toy together.
You may want to have your mixed breed wear a short leash — a
pull tab, so that you have something to grab if he decides to look
at the distraction instead of you. A light tug of redirection might be
enough to remind him that you have far better rewards for him
than that distraction does.
Finding a Trainer
Every dog is different, and many mixed breeds bring with them 
a whole lot of baggage. Negative experiences your dog has had in 
the past may cause any number of abnormal reactions, so if you’re
having trouble with training, you’ll want to work with a profes-
sional trainer.
You need the help of a pro when:
 You’ve tried to train your dog, but you aren’t pleased with 
the response.
 Your dog continues to disobey no matter how consistent
you’ve been.
 Your dog is very distracted by other dogs or people.
 Your dog has bad habits that are difficult to cure, such as
housetraining accidents, excessive chewing, excessive bark-
ing, or mouthing.
 Your dog shows signs of aggression, such as dominant postur-
ing, staring you in the eye for long periods, being pushy to get
what he wants, barking for attention, grabbing hold of you
with his mouth, or biting.
 Your dog shows signs of fear, such as backing up while bark-
ing and snarling, or biting you from behind.
 You’re pulling on the leash so much that you don’t want to
walk with him anymore.
 You’re so frustrated that you’re reconsidering dog ownership.
If any of the preceding applies to you and your situation, look into
working with a professional trainer.
To find a good trainer, start by asking your dog’s vet and groomer.
Owners of small pet shops can often recommend trainers as well.
(Large, chain pet shops have their own trainers, who may or may
Chapter 11: Hup, Two, Three, Four: Good Manners and Basic Training 157

not be what you’re looking for.) You can also locate professional
trainers through the following Web sites:
 The Association of Pet Dog Trainers (www.apdt.com): This
group certifies trainers through testing and education. All 
certified trainers take a specific number of educational credits
each year so they’re current on training methods and scien-
tific behavioral knowledge.
 The International Association of Canine Professionals (www.
dogpro.org): This group includes only professional trainers
who have more than five years of experience. When they say
professional trainer, they mean someone whose main source of
income is through training dogs. IACP also offers certification
to members.
 National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors (www.
nadoi.com): This group has been around longer than the first
two in this list. It requires certification in Novice, Open, and
Utility, among other offerings such as Agility and Rally-O in
order for a trainer to maintain membership. These certifica-
tions pertain more toward showing dogs than obedience 
training. Someone with the knowledge needed to show a 
dog, however, can often help others with basic training issues.

Training Challenges

 Making Emily Post proud: Curing bad manners
M
any mixed-breed dogs have already learned some less-than-
stellar behaviors in their previous environments. These
problems are ones you want to identify and correct sooner rather
than later. The first step in reversing a particular behavior is
understanding why the problem exists in the first place. Is it
because of something that happened in the past? Or are you doing
something now that’s causing the problem? What is it about your
mixed-breed dog’s personality that makes her act that way? These
are the questions that you need to ask — and this chapter is the
place where you find the answers.
Regardless of the reason for the behavior, you can teach your
mixed-breed dog how to get attention (the positive kind) by doing
something you want instead of something you don’t want. In this
chapter, I show you how.
I start by explaining why many mixed-breed dogs — particularly
those from shelters, humane societies, and rescue groups — have
special training challenges. Then I cover the most common problem:
separation anxiety. Because many dogs also display some form of
aggression, or have pushy personalities, I talk about the various
types of aggression and how to deal with them. Finally, regardless of
where your mixed breed originated, she may have behavioral issues
that need to be addressed. I fill you in on some common behavior
problems — such as jumping up, excessive chewing, mouthing, and
digging — and tell you how to handle these issues in your own dog.

Unpacking the Mental Baggage:
Helping a Dog Who’s Been 
Abused or Neglected
Most mixed-breed dogs have had a rough start. Many are a result
of the accidental breeding of purebreds who weren’t neutered or
spayed and, as unwanted puppies, they’re treated with little
respect and care.
As unwanted pets, mixed breeds are caught by animal-control offi-
cers or brought to shelters. Some are found by concerned citizens
and given to rescue groups and humane societies. Many accidental
pups are dropped by the side of the road and left to fate. Regardless
of how the pups or dogs make their way to permanent owners,
most have gone through horrible experiences — ranging from a
lack of a home with a loving family to outright abuse and neglect.
As the result of having no sense of permanent territory, reliable
nutrition, or loving care, most mixed-breed dogs have several 
serious issues. And as the owner of a mixed-breed dog, it’s up 
to you to manage and help your dog overcome those problems.
Have you ever met a dog who shies away when you raise your
arm? Or a dog who’s frightened of children or men wearing hats?
All these fears are based on past experiences where people of 
similar demeanor or appearance abused or frightened the dog 
in some manner.
Past events even affect young pups. Though easily trained at a
very young age, they’re also influenced by every experience —
good and bad. They remember extreme experiences for a long
time, until they’re totally convinced — by someone like you — 
that life can be good, without fear and deprivation.
Regardless of whether your mixed breed is 2 months old or 2 years
old, she’s a composite of her past — and you get the wonderful (and
sometimes challenging) job of guiding her toward a brighter future.
Alone and Frightened: 
Separation Anxiety
Between the moment she made her way into this world, all slimy and
new, to the moment you brought your dog home, she’s likely lived in
more than two places. Most purebred dogs get the socialization they
Part III: Training 101 
160

need while they’re with their litter, mom, and breeder. They’re given
proper nutrition, handling, and healthcare — and they get nothing
but this loving care from birth. Mixed-breed dogs rarely have these
benefits.
Unless your mixed breed is a designer dog (see Chapter 2) or was
bred by a caring breeder, she has likely had little care, socialization
with people or other animals, and possibly long periods of poor
nutrition. All these factors form the dog’s overall personality.
Usually, after a dog has been in a new home for a period of time,
she’ll settle into the routine. But if your dog has never had any-
thing like a normal routine, she may suddenly think her world is
caving in when you go to work for the day or go to sleep in another
room. She’s worried that her new family is disappearing. She won-
ders if she’ll ever have another good meal. She’s thinking, “Maybe
all those poets were right, and love really is a fleeting thing.”
If this is what’s running through your dog’s mind when she’s alone,
she has separation anxiety. A dog with separation anxiety is very
insecure in every aspect of her life.
Recognizing the symptoms
The symptoms of separation anxiety can range from barely discern-
able to extremely destructive. In the following sections, I fill you in.
Excessive drooling
Your dog may drool as she watches you grilling hamburgers and
hot dogs, preparing a meal in the kitchen, or eating at the table.
This kind of drooling is what dogs are all about. But dogs salivate
for several reasons. One of them is because they’re dying to grab
that piece of meat out of your hands and run away with it. And
another reason is because they’re anxious.
A dog who salivates due to anxiety doesn’t just drip little puddles —
she covers herself in moisture as the saliva pours through her lips
like a hose that hasn’t been turned off all the way. She does this
because she doesn’t realize that you’ll come back at some point, she
doesn’t understand her environment, she doesn’t know how to com-
municate with you, and she doesn’t know what you expect of her.
Dogs with separation anxiety don’t just drool when they’re left
home alone. They may also drool excessively when they’re riding
in a car (if they’re afraid of cars) or when they’re frightened of a
new place or situation. In other words, fear is what brings about
the drool.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 161

The loud protest: Whining and barking
Excessive whining and barking are easy to identify. Your neighbors
know it when they hear it: an annoying outburst while you’re away
from home. If you’re living in an apartment, a townhouse, or a
densely populated neighborhood with a noisy dog, you’ll likely
hear from your neighbors that your best friend is upset about
being home alone. Your dog may bark and whine when you’re
home but not right next to her — for example, when you’ve left
your dog outside in the yard or in another room without you.
When you hear your dog whining or barking, your first reaction is
probably to run to the poor dog because you can’t stand that she’s
upset. Don’t do it! You’ll be reinforcing this behavior because you
gave her what she had been whining about — your presence. The
next time you go somewhere, she’ll turn it up another notch or two.
Dogs learn very quickly! Later in this chapter, I discuss ways to stop
the noise through training, structure, and positive reinforcement.
Self-mutilation: Biting and scratching
Self-mutilation can begin with excessive licking in one spot, making
lick granulomas (also known as hot spots), which are swelled,
raised, and irritated skin. Your dog’s behavior can go on from there
to pulling out her hair, rubbing her eyes, and doing any uncontrol-
lable motion such as twisting and circling while whining or barking.
Tearing it up: Destructive behavior
Destructive behavior, like chewing your furniture, digging a hole in
the carpet, or chewing up your favorite pair of shoes are symptoms
of separation anxiety. The more severe the separation anxiety, the
worse the destruction.
Dogs who are only slightly upset at their human companions being
gone will chew one item, like a book or the TV remote control;
dogs who are severely upset will destroy entire rooms of furniture,
carpeting, and doors.
From the dog’s point of view, she’s trying very hard to go find her
people. She feels as though she’s been left out of the family pack
and she’s trying to join up with the family again. Being away from
the pack is a huge feeling of insecurity. (Given a choice, dogs will
typically choose social groupings of more than one individual.)
When you come home to find that your dog has torn up the house,
she wasn’t doing it out of spite because you left — she was doing 
it because she was afraid. If you keep that in mind, you won’t be 
as angry and you’ll feel more compassionate toward your new 
best friend.
Part III: Training 101 
162

Aggression
Many dogs don’t want to see their people leave the house. They
may have tried to get your attention through barking or digging,
and you just didn’t seem to understand that message. Time for a
more direct approach: aggression.
Most likely, the dog isn’t showing aggression because she wants to
hurt anybody — she’s showing aggression as a way of keeping her
pack together.
Discerning the difference between aggression associated with 
separation anxiety and other types of aggression can be difficult.
The easiest way to tell the difference is that if the aggression is 
due to separation anxiety, it only happens as someone walks to 
the door, and the dog normally attacks from behind. The bite is
more a pinch than anything else — the dog isn’t doing it to being
mean. The bite is fear related — fear of never seeing you again.
Regardless of the reason, when your dog is aggressive, seeking pro-
fessional help is best. Aggressive behavior of any kind is a serious
issue and should be addressed immediately —both for your safety
and the dog’s future with your family.
Knowing what to do about it
Separation anxiety is something that can be conquered, but you’ll
need patience, fortitude, and consistency. At times, you may feel
that it’s just too much work, but keep in mind that a couple months
of struggle is nothing in comparison to the many years of joy ahead
with your mixed-breed dog.
You can do several things to reduce and/or cure separation anxiety.
I cover them in the following sections.
Containing the problem
Most dogs feel overwhelmed when faced with a huge unfamiliar
area. Too many scary things might happen: The mail carrier comes
up to the house, other dogs walk by the yard, neighbors ring the
doorbell when no one’s home, cars pass on the street, a squirrel
invades the tree in the yard. . . . Your dog is aware of everything she
can see through the windows or hear outside.
Most dogs seek a small, dark place when they’re worried. Such a
place makes them feel secure from outside threats. In fact, wild
canines always have a den where they can sleep or whelp their
pups. A crate can simulate this safe place, because the dog feels
something solid on all sides.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 163

Placing your mixed breed in a crate will not only give your dog a
sense of security, but also keep her from injuring herself through
destructive behavior, such as eating carpet strands, chewing on elec-
trical cords, or eating poisonous houseplants. The crate offers safety
for your dog and sanity for you — no mess when you get home.
A dog should not be contained in a crate for more than five hours
at a time. If you must be away from home for longer periods than
this, consider other options, such as hiring a dog walker or fencing
off a portion of your yard. Remember to provide a source of shelter
and water if you leave your dog in a fenced yard.
Going to obedience training
Obedience training doesn’t just teach your dog to come, sit, and
heel. It also gives her a chance to learn how to communicate with
you and to understand her environment. A trained dog is happier
and more relaxed. She has something to look forward to every day.
You can use training in many ways to help your relationship with
your dog, from alleviating separation anxiety and overcoming
many types of aggression to curbing bad manners such as jumping
and excessive barking.
In Chapter 11, I cover positive training techniques that help in
every aspect of your dog’s life.
Sticking to a routine
Structuring your mixed-breed dog’s day will give her an idea of
what to expect and when. Dogs like knowing when it’s time to eat,
sleep, play, and greet you at the door. They don’t have to look at
clocks to know what time it is. Dogs quickly develop a sense of
time. Knowing what’s going to happen when helps the dog relax —
she doesn’t have to worry about surprises or unknowns.
Part III: Training 101 
164
Attitude is everything . . . and yours
is the one that matters
Dogs with separation anxiety tend to be destructive. If your dog has separation anx-
iety, you may come home to see that destruction. Being upset is only natural, but
as your dog picks up on your anger, pretty soon she’ll feel afraid when you return
home instead of being eager to see you.
Teaching your dog to not miss you and returning home with a positive attitude — no
matter what you find when you get there — will help alleviate your dog’s anxieties.

Structure can also teach your dog to not miss you, proving to her
that nice things happen as you leave.
Here is a regular routine you can practice to help ease the separa-
tion anxiety. It works because it redirects your dog’s anxiety to
something pleasant, something she’ll look forward to.
1. Begin by finding something that has high value to your
dog, such as a food-stuffed toy or special squeaky toy.
2. If you’re keeping your dog contained in a crate, place
that special toy or treat in the containment area as you
leave the room.
3. Peek around the corner and watch the dog’s response.
4. If she’s content playing with her toy, return into the room
and praise her.
5. Release her from her crate.
6. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 a little later, waiting a few more
minutes as she plays or chews the toy.
Each time you do this, wait longer and longer, until your
dog can remain for at least a half-hour in this manner with-
out any anxiety response.
Training your dog not to miss you
Using the reward-when-you-leave system (see the preceding sec-
tion) is very helpful in teaching your dog that good things happen
upon your leaving, but it may not sustain her while you’re gone.
You can condition your dog to be more accepting of your absence
by starting small. Begin by giving your dog her special treat when
you leave the room. Check around the corner where she can’t see
you. When she finishes with her toy, return and reward her with
praise. Gradually increase the time between giving her the as-you-
leave-toy and returning with praise. If you see your dog looking
around for you before she finishes her treat, you’ve spent too
much time away, too soon. You’ve conditioned her to look for you
instead of enjoying her toy. You may need to offer a higher value
toy. Gradually increase your time away, allowing your dog to slowly
acclimate to the fact you’re gone and that when you return, good
things happen.
Socializing with other dogs
Dogs are pack animals. They need the company of others in order
to feel secure. If you have long workdays, try to find a way of offer-
ing your dog opportunities to socialize with other dogs while
you’re gone.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 165

Doggie playtime is important to your dog’s social development in
many ways:
 Dogs teach each other proper social skills, such as how to
get along with others and appropriate behavior in specific
situations.
 Canine play gives your dog the exercise she needs to
remain physically and mentally healthy. Are you going to 
get down on the floor and wrestle? Most likely not. You’re also
unlikely to use your mouth to grab your mixed breed’s legs or
jump about and race around. In fact, I don’t suggest doing that
at all, or your dog won’t respect you as her leader. There are
ways of playing with your dog that offer positive interaction
without making her think she’s your equal.
You can offer your dog canine social time in several ways:
 Send your dog to doggie daycare. Doggie daycare gives your
dog exercise and social time while you’re at work, alleviating
her separation anxiety and reducing her desire to control the
activity at home.
 Find people in your neighborhood who have dogs of similar
size and temperament, and arrange a specific time every
day or at least several days per week when the dogs can
come together and play. The more often you do this, the
healthier for all the dogs involved.
 Get a second dog. If you don’t have the convenience of neigh-
bors with dogs or a doggie daycare nearby, get a second dog.
Your dog will have fewer anxieties if she can cuddle with
someone while you’re away.
Medications and alternative treatments for anxiety
Homeopathic remedies are available for treating anxiety of 
many types. Among them are flower, herbal, and aromatherapies.
Amazingly, the tiniest essence of specific flowers and herbs help
dogs relax and change their mindset. These remedies have been
around far longer than modern medicine and have a proven record
for working even when prescription medications won’t.
I normally try a homeopathic remedy before using a prescription
one, because the prescriptions target symptoms instead of the
source. Homeopathic remedies target the source of an illness,
injury, or behavioral problem. Using homeopathics in conjunction
with behavior modification and obedience training will cure a large
percentage of dogs with separation anxiety.

Flower and herbal remedies
Ever heard the saying “Stop and smell the roses”? Well, there’s a 
lot to that old adage and not just in the sense of learning to enjoy
every day of your life. Flower essences have very powerful healing
properties. They can relax, prevent anxiety, and aid in the healing
of illness. Ever notice the plethora of aromatherapy products avail-
able? Candles, essential oils, soaps, and sachets — they’re popular
because they work.
Following is a brief list of some of the flower essences that help
with separation anxiety. You can apply them via a tincture (directly
into your dog’s mouth) or you allow the dog to inhale them using
aromatherapy:
 Chamomile: This flower essence helps relax a dog’s muscles —
sort of like a powerful muscle relaxant given to people with pulls
and sprains — but it doesn’t affect the digestive system as much
as a prescription muscle relaxer. People have drunk chamomile
tea for centuries as a way to unwind from a stressful day.
 Phosphorus, pulsatilla, and arsenicum: Use these if your dog
panics when left alone.
 Rescue Remedy Bach Flower Essences: This blend of flower
essences helps dogs with anxieties of many kinds, from sepa-
ration and fear to grieving. The blend consists of Rock Rose,
Star of Bethlehem, Impatiens, Cherry Plum, and Clematis.
Approaching behavioral problems holistically (with herbal reme-
dies) is helpful in many ways. You’re addressing the source of the
problem — and when the source is removed or modified, the
symptoms can be gradually reduced or eradicated. Training and
scheduling help remove the source of separation anxiety, and
herbal blends help the dog through the transition period, offering 
a means of remaining calm. Flower essences are often added to the
herbal blends.
Here are some herbal remedies I recommend:
 Scullcap: This herbal aids with nervous disorders.
 Valerian root: This helps calm a hyperactive dog.
 Belladonna: This herbal reduces anxiety and calms the dog
enough for her to relax when she’s left alone.
 Vervain: This is another herb that calms the dog, much like
valerian root.
 Aspen: This herbal helps the dog feel secure, less alone.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 167

A professional herbologist has to mix the correct doses of herbs
and flower essences, so get prepackaged blends that target specific
behaviors. You can usually find these blends at your local health-
food or vitamin store. Many Web sites sell good herbal products,
too, including the following:
 Equilite (www.equilite.com)
 My Fine Equine (www.myfineequine.com)
 Hilton Herbs (www.hiltonherbs.com)
 NativeRemedies.com (www.nativeremedies.com)
 Alternative Veterinary Hospital (www.alternativeveterinary
hospital.com/bach_essences.htm)
 BachFlower.com (www.bachflower.com)
Prescription medicines
The most commonly used prescription medication for separation
anxiety is Clomicalm. It specifically targets the symptoms of separa-
tion anxiety, not only helping the dog to relax, much like chamomile,
but also reducing the dog’s reactivity to her environment. Your
mixed breed is less likely to get as upset about sudden noises (such
as a knock on the door or a delivery truck). The only drawback of
Clomicalm is that it can take up to six weeks to see the benefits.
Amitriptyline is another prescription drug used for canine cognitive
dysfunction (CCD, which is similar to senility in humans) and separa-
tion anxiety. It tends to work faster than Clomicalm but has more side
effects, such as retention of urine, loss of appetite, and drowsiness.
These prescription drugs are not to be used for more than a three-
month period, under veterinary guidance. They treat the symptoms,
not the source, of separation anxiety. Use them in conjunction with
behavior-modification techniques aimed at teaching your dog that
she won’t be left alone forever. Within a few months, you’ll have a
dog who is well adjusted enough to live without medications.
Severe anxiety: When 
to seek outside help
Sometimes, nothing seems to work. You’ve tried everything, and
Buster is still displaying the anxiety. At this point you should seek
professional help. Your veterinarian, an animal behaviorist, or a pro-
fessional dog trainer have the experience to overcome these issues
using positive reinforcement techniques. It may be time consuming,
but the rewards are worth it: a well-adjusted mixed-breed dog who
relaxes while you’re gone and happily greets you upon your return.
Part III: Training 101 
168

You know you need to get help when:
 Your dog becomes very upset when left in a crate.
 Your dog is soaking wet from saliva when you return home.
 Your dog is eating things that can make her sick.
 Your dog is biting and chewing on herself.
 Your dog is biting you or others.
 Your dog is behaving oddly (circling as she whines, biting at
the air, clinging to your heels everywhere you go, sucking on
something, shivering and cowering).
There are three specialists who can help:
 Your veterinarian: The first person you should contact for
help with severe separation anxiety is your vet. Many sources
of behavioral issues are based on physical problems, so it’s
best to first rule these out. When visiting with your vet, explain
what your dog is doing and when it occurs. Your vet will do a
full exam. If the vet doesn’t mention it, request a full blood
chemistry — organ dysfunction (which shows up in the blood
chemistry) can be a source of behavioral problems.
If your vet gives the all-clear and says your dog has no 
physical problems, call an animal behaviorist.
 Animal behaviorist: An animal behaviorist, who is a veteri-
nary specialist in behavioral medicine, can come to your
home and pinpoint the cause of the anxiety, offering ways of
solving it. A veterinary behaviorist can prescribe the medica-
tions; some will suggest herbal or flower remedies.
When you meet with the animal behaviorist, explain and try
to emulate the situations that produce the separation anxiety
as closely as possible so that the behaviorist can observe
firsthand. Ask about ways to change the routine, or how to
redirect your dog so he can see the situation as something
more positive instead of scary.
 Dog trainer: A dog trainer can help you in the long term,
because you’ll learn how to teach your dog about her environ-
ment and how she can communicate with you. Many dog
trainers also know the correct herbal remedies and apothe-
caries to aid in training your dog to overcome her anxieties.
As you train your dog, you’re setting her up for a successful
life with you and your family. As with the animal behaviorist,
show your trainer what occurs and when so that the specific
issues can be addressed. Ask about ways to train your dog to
accept the situation or about ways you can change a routine
to help her relax or relieve the anxiety.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 169

No More Mr. Nice Guy: 
The Aggressive Dog
Because of their past bad experiences, some mixed-breed dogs
develop some form of aggression, usually for self-defense. Most
aggression in mixed-breed dogs has to do with possession — the
dog may have had to fend for itself, experiencing a scarcity of food
and/or shelter. Your dog isn’t intentionally unpleasant to you —
she’s just developed instinctual reactions to specific situations.
Almost all types of aggression can be controlled or even cured with
obedience training, behavioral therapy, and the help of appropriate
apothecaries. In this section, I give you the information you need to
help your aggressive dog.
Recognizing the types of aggression
Aggression comes in several varieties, and recognizing the type of
aggression your dog is exhibiting is the first step toward solving
the problem. When you know why the dog is behaving the way 
she is, you can remove the cause and work toward eliminating 
the behavior.
Always consult with a pet professional prior to tackling any type 
of aggressive behavior, because an incorrect approach can often
cause even worse problems.
It hurts, don’t touch: Pain-related aggression
Pain-related aggression is common in dogs who aren’t familiar with
humane treatment for their pain, or in dogs who hurt so much that
they can’t control their behavior. This type of aggression can take
time to cure. Often, the dog must be tranquilized to be treated for
the source of the pain.
This dog won’t display any aggressive posturing, such as trying to
appear large, snarling, growling or snapping, prior to a bite. If you
touch something that hurts, she lashes out.
The need to lead: Dominant aggression
Dominant aggression can be very dangerous. A dog who is domi-
nantly aggressive wants to control you and others. She can display
this aggression in a very subtle manner, from demanding attention
by pushing against you to outright snapping at you. Although train-
ing can help control this dog, there is still a possibility of someone
getting hurt.
Part III: Training 101 
170

A dog who is dominantly aggressive will often posture prior to
biting. This dog will likely display her teeth, growl, pace, and stare.
She makes herself look large by standing stiffly, with her ears for-
ward and tail up, staring at your face with little or no blinking.
Past is present: Fear aggression
There is always a reason for fear aggression. It’s the most common
type of aggression in dogs who have gone through several homes
or were rescued from a bad situation. A dog who displays fear
aggression doesn’t want to control the family — she’s merely 
insecure and nervous.
Most dogs who end up in shelters suffer from insecurity. They
don’t understand their surroundings and can’t communicate with
those around them. Dogs in shelters are like travelers in a foreign
country where they don’t understand the customs or the language.
Think of your dog in this way and you’ll better understand why she
needs instant guidance and training to alleviate this problem.
You can easily recognize fear aggression through body posturing.
The dog will back up, hackles raised, head lowered, and tail down.
Don’t approach a dog displaying this behavior — she’ll feel cor-
nered and lash out. Bites from fearful dogs are usually surface
bites, because the dog doesn’t want to hurt you (he just wants to
warn you), but the bites are painful and frightening nonetheless.
What’s mine is mine! Possessive aggression
Possessive aggression is a type of dominant aggression, but it’s
only seen when the dog has something she wants to keep to her-
self. Dogs who have had to compete for food or other resources
commonly display possessive aggression.
This dog will growl as you near her when she has a toy or food. Her
head will be lowered, nose toward the object, her body held very
stiff. You might even see the whites of her eyes, because she’s
afraid that you’ll take her possession from her.
Me first, me first! Sibling rivalries
There will always be scuffles of some sort within the family pack as
new family members try to determine their place. Most of these
scuffles will consist of snarling and posturing. The “arguments”
only get worse if people interfere or don’t establish their own 
leadership over the dogs. 
It begins with dominant stares and can turn into an all-out war. 
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 171

Knowing what to do about it
Regardless of the type of dominance your dog has, consult with 
a professional dog trainer or behaviorist to handle the problem.
Controlling and curing these issues require extensive knowledge 
of canine behavior. Though difficult, most of these behaviors are
curable.
Here are some guidelines to follow as you help your dog overcome
her aggression:
 If your dog show signs of pain — such as limping or a sensi-
tivity to light, sound, the presence of others, or touch — go
to your vet . . . immediately. Some dogs don’t show pain-
related behavior. Because part of their instinctive behavior is
to not display weakness, your dog may not limp or be lethar-
gic. It’s still a good idea to have her checked by your vet, just
in case. Internal injuries, bone or muscle inflammation, or
organ malfunction can all cause distress, which can in turn
cause pain-related aggression.
 If your dog is trying to take over the household or wants to
always be first, step up your leadership role through obedi-
ence training (see Chapter 11) and maintenance of social
hierarchy. Never allow your dog to sleep on your bed, sit on
your sofa, or beg at the table. All these indulgences will lead
to your dog being the boss.
 Build your dog’s confidence through regular scheduling of
exercise, feeding times, and obedience training. All these
regular activities play a large role in helping your dog feel 
safe and help her realize that she’s in a permanent home.
 Because your dog has the energy to display aggression, you
need to get that energy under control with lots of exercise.
A tired dog is less likely to be assertive than one with loads of
energy. Focus on making sure your mixed breed gets so much
exercise that she actually drops with exhaustion upon her
return home.
You can also work her through her predilection for assertive-
ness. Put her on her leash. Work her at all times, making her
heel with you from room to room. Make her sit or go into a
down/stay while there. Make her come to you prior to going
into another room. Because she has to concentrate on paying
attention, and defer the leadership position to you, she’ll no
longer have the desire to be the boss.
Part III: Training 101 
172

 If your dog is displaying any type of aggression, use apothe-
caries such as flower or herbal remedies (see the “Flower
and herbal remedies” section, earlier in this chapter). Using
these as you train your dog will help her pay attention and
increase her desire to learn — she’ll no longer have the “new
dog on the block” anxieties to contend with.
 Consider prescription medications. When you know the
reason for the aggression, you and your vet can discuss the
type of medication that would be most useful. Amitriptyline is
often used to modify the dog’s reactivity to her environment.
Diazepamis also used to calm the dog. Acepromazine can also
be used.
You may need to keep your dog on the medication for several
weeks before you can tell whether it’s working for her. These
drugs aren’t to be used instead of training your dog, but
rather in conjunction with the training process
Sometimes prescription medication can have adverse effects,
causing worse or unpredictable aggression, or side effects
involving other organ systems.. Keep a close eye on your dog
and maintain close communication with your vet and/or vet-
erinary behaviorist.
Jumping for Joy
Jumping on people, furniture or countertops are the most common
behavior problems with dogs. It’s annoying, frustrating, and disrup-
tive. But you can do something about it. In this section, I lay it all out.
Knowing why dogs jump
One of the main reasons dogs begin jumping up is to greet newcom-
ers or companions (that’s you!) who have returned home. They first
touch noses, then go sniff the newcomer’s rear end to learn who it
is and what her intentions may be. This is the canine way.
Before you correct your dog for jumping, you need to discover why
she’s doing it. Most likely she’s getting some reward for jumping up.
Maybe she gets touched or she’s spoken to. Some dogs merely like to
perch higher than the floor — the old “I’m the king of the castle, and
you’re the dirty rascal” game. Maybe jumping is such a fun way to get
you to play with her that she’ll do it every time she wants attention.
The next time your dog jumps on you, note your reaction. Did you
push at her? Yell at her? Pet her? Your reaction to her behavior will
tell you the reason she does it.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 173

Keeping your dog’s feet 
on the ground
You can do several things to cure the habit of jumping, no matter
why your dog is doing it:
 Greet your dog lower to the ground — and ask your guests
to do so as well. Instead of making your dog reach upward to
say, “Hi,” crouch down low to allow an appropriate nose
touch. This is far better than being jumped on or goosed in
your behind. If you don’t want your face washed in doggie
saliva, keep your head up and offer your hands in greeting,
holding them low and allowing your dog to sniff or lick them.
 Condition your dog to get a tummy rub upon your arrival,
by having her sit, then lie down, so you can rub her tummy.
What better way to be greeted than having your dog throw
herself at your feet, panting in anticipation as she awaits a
belly rub?
 Try ignoring your dog the next time she jumps on you. Don’t
touch her. Don’t speak to her. Don’t look at her. In fact, step
away and hold your arms up so that she can’t go to the next
level of “I want attention now” and put her mouth on your hand.
 When you’re in a situation where your dog is jumping, tell
her to sit. This will redirect her from doing the bad thing to
doing something good — it gives her a way she can earn posi-
tive attention. Remember: Don’t ask your dog to sit too soon
after the jumping up or you’ll be creating a fun game called
Jump and Sit. Dogs learn patterns very easily, and if she thinks
she’ll be rewarded for jumping and then sitting, she’ll be per-
sistent about it.
If you’ve told your dog to sit and she’s too busy jumping to 
do so, make sure that you place her into position. When she’s
in position, praise her. Don’t get too carried away with the
praise, though — you did have to place her into a sit. You 
can get more excited when your dog sits without your help,
especially if she comes to you and sits for attention instead 
of jumping up for it.
Try not to get frustrated. Your dog didn’t learn to jump up overnight,
and you won’t cure her overnight. Remain calm, focused, and in con-
trol. Dogs know when you’ve reached your breaking point. You have
to prove that you have no breaking point. Eventually, your dog will
understand that you’re in charge of doling out rewards and that she
has to change her attention-seeking behavior.
Part III: Training 101 
174

Also, be consistent. If you make your dog sit for attention one time,
but you’re absentmindedly petting her while she has her feet on
your lap another time, she won’t learn to stop jumping up. If you
really want to stop this behavior, you must always follow the law:
No jumping up ever. No touching, speaking, or looking at jumping
dogs — only sitting dogs get the reward.
Curing the insistent jumper
Some dogs have the jumping habit with little help from their
human companions. They simply enjoy the act of jumping up in
the air because it gives them thrills and chills. Some of these dogs
will hop about without even touching their people. Others will
touch occasionally. Some dogs not only spring in the air but also
bounce off of their humans as though they were springboards.
Ignoring these dogs won’t stop the behavior. Sometimes having
them sit for attention will tone it down a little, but only if the dog is
jumping up for your attention. Even if you maintain your cool and
are consistent with your reactions, you still may not make a dent in
this airborne wonder. Stopping the behavior through ignoring won’t
work either. You’ll have to use a correction to change the behavior.
Most dogs respond well to a sound correction — something that
makes an aversive sound. Dogs have far more sensitive hearing than
humans, so certain pitches, volumes, or frequencies can distract
them enough to stop a behavior that coincides with the sound.
You can use several objects to create aversive sounds when your
dog jumps on you:
 Pennies in a can: Get a small metal can, such as one used for
loose tea, paint, or a small coffee can. Place 15 pennies inside
the can and be sure to seal the lid securely. When your dog
jumps up, shake the can hard just once or twice. If this aversive
sound is going to work, it will work fairly quickly. Your dog will
stop jumping and either move away from you or sit. If she sits,
praise her. If she moves away, wait until she returns and sits or
remains with all four paws on the floor, and then praise her.
 Rocks in a milk carton: Place small rocks inside a plastic milk
jug. Use it in the same manner as the can (see the preceding
item). This is not as harsh a sound as the can; if your dog is
very reactive to sound, you may want to try this first.
 A bicycle horn: A honk on a bicycle horn will definitely get
your dog’s attention. She’ll likely step back and have a long
look at you as though you’ve just issued the weirdest noise
she’s ever heard. She may be looking at you funny, but she
stopped jumping, right?
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 175

If your dog doesn’t like water, you can use a water gun (the Super
Soaker brand water guns work best) to squirt water at her when
she jumps up. The mere action of something coming at her should
be enough to distract your dog and stop the behavior. This won’t
work with dogs who love water — these dogs will be encouraged
to jump more in order to play the water game. If your mixed breed
has any Retriever or Spaniel in her, I recommend using the aversive
sound instead of the water squirt.
Chewing Your Dog 
Out for Chewing
Dogs love to chew. It’s their favorite pastime. You can read books;
watch TV; play sports, video games, and board games; or spend
time on hobbies. Dogs don’t have these things. They chew and dig
and chew and run and chew. They chew their toys. They chew on
sticks. They chew the sofa. Yikes! That’s something you don’t want
them to chew. Why would your dog chew a sofa when she has her
bone nearby? In this section, I tell you why — and help you get
your dog to stop chewing things she shouldn’t be chewing.
Understanding why dogs chew
Dogs chew for a variety of reasons. The main reason has to do with
their age. All puppies chew. They’re testing their environment for
tasty morsels and for ways to alleviate the pain in their gums. If
your dog is younger than 9 months of age, she’s teething. Here’s
how normal teething develops:
 Between the ages of 3 months and 5 months, the baby teeth
are falling out. You’ll see your dog’s front teeth being replaced
with the larger, adult incisors. Your pup will be pulling at her
toys as she explores objects for palatability. Watch out for
those electrical cords — they look mighty tasty!
 Between the ages of 5 and 7 months of age, your pup’s back
teeth are falling out and being replaced with new ones. When
the new molars grow in, it’s very uncomfortable for your dog.
She won’t be chewing to learn about her environment — she’ll
be chewing to alleviate the discomfort in her gums. Anything
hard is fair game. Wood of all sorts, such as molding, window
frames, chairs, table legs, carpeting, shoes, plastic children’s
toys, books, and more.
 At 7 to 8 months of age, the molars are all in, but still a little
loose in the gums. Chewing has become more of a pastime
than a need, but it’s still enjoyable as a way of releasing dis-
comfort, anxiety, or boredom.
Part III: Training 101 
176

That brings me to the other reasons for chewing:
 Anxiety: A dog with anxiety can be extremely destructive. She
doesn’t just chew — she flings and swings the objects about,
tramples and pulls, paws and scratches. Dogs chewing
because of anxiety create a huge mess.
 Boredom: A dog who chews because she’s bored may not create
as large a destructive path as a dog who chews because she’s
anxious, but the bored dog can still do some heavy-duty damage.
Windowsills are typical targets for bored dogs, as are other types
of wall molding, shoes left about, or other household items that
have fallen to the floor. Toys become old, known things, whereas
a dish towel, pillow, or sneaker is like a brand-new toy.
Solving the problem
You can either prevent chewing from becoming a problem or deal
with curing a bad habit. Even if your mixed breed arrived with a
chewing problem, you can do things to prevent her from continu-
ing her destructive path.
You’ll need to be watchful, patient, and consistent. Guide your mixed
breed in the right direction much as you would guide a young child —
after all, your dog really doesn’t know that your couch pillows are off
limits, or that the table legs aren’t just big chew bones.
Prevention is worth a pound of pillows
The best thing to do when you aren’t able to watch your dog is to
contain her in an area where she can’t get into trouble. Containing
your dog when you can’t watch her will prevent her from chewing
the wrong things — she can’t have access to them without your
being present. (For more on containment options, see Chapter 10.)
When you are able to watch your dog, redirect her from the things
she can’t chew to the things she can play with. Playing with her
will make the items more attractive — dogs prefer interactive
games to playing alone.
Because boredom is a main ingredient in developing problem
chewing, you can do several things to prevent this from occurring:
 Train, train, train. A trained dog knows the rules and will be
less likely to chew the wrong items.
 Rotate the toys. Dogs get bored with the same old toys. Had
’em, mouthed ’em, tired of ’em. If you offer your dog a differ-
ent variety of toys each day, your dog will think, “Wow! Brand-
new toys! This is neat!” It will occupy her time, reducing the
chance of boredom.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 177

 Get another dog. The presence of another dog alleviates
boredom.
 Make sure she’s getting enough exercise. A tired dog won’t
do anything destructive. Take your dog for a run, or long walk
each morning before going to work and again when you get
home from work. You may want to vary the routine — for
example, go for a walk in the morning and play ball in the
afternoon. Add some training time to this routine. Teach 
your dog some new tricks.
 Stimulate your dog’s mind. There are many ways to stimulate
your dog’s mind:
• Interactive toys: You can find all kinds of interactive
toys in your local pet store — toys that can be pulled
apart and put back together, toys that can be filled with
food, toys that involve pet and human or several dogs at
the same time. You can never give your pet too many
toys. In fact, if you’re not tripping over toys, you proba-
bly don’t have enough. And don’t forget to rotate them!
• Social time: Doggie daycare is a great alternative for
dogs who spend a lot of time home alone. Instead of
being left home day after day, bored, you take your dog
to a place where she’ll have fun socializing with other
dogs and people. You come home from work tired, and
she will, too. You can both relax.
If you have a dog park in the area, take your mixed-breed
dog there, daily. Make it part of the routine, regardless of
the weather. Few dogs care more about a rainy day than
playing with other dogs.
Offering your mixed breed these bits of stimulation will pre-
vent her from doing the bad chewing and create a far more
positive relationship with you.
Knowing what to do when your dog is in mid-chew
What do you do when your dog has something in her mouth that she
shouldn’t have? Let’s say she just grabbed one of your Italian leather
loafers and ran off, initiating a game of chase. The last thing you want
is to lose a $200 pair of shoes, so you run after her. Well, she thinks,
this is great fun. Now she knows how to get a game started. And
guess what? This won’t be the last time she does this — unless you
offer her a positive alternative.
The Chase Me game is not a new invention created by your dog just
because she enjoys the taste of your shoes, laundry, or pillows. It’s a
common game that dogs play with each other. One dog grabs a toy,
tantalizes the other dog with it by pacing in front and dangling it
under the other dog’s nose, and then when she sees the other dog
make a grab for it, she runs, with the other dog racing after her.
Part III: Training 101 
178

You have to offer something better without also rewarding her for
the behavior. Dogs often pick up objects they’re not supposed to
have, such as shoes or other household items as well as trash that
may be littering the paths you walk with your dog, you need a way
of teaching your mixed breed to drop the item on command, with-
out having to run her down and pry the object from her mouth.
This is called the exchange-and-reward system. You offer your dog
a better alternative to the yucky piece of trash or dirty laundry.
Here’s how it goes:
1. Put a long leash on your dog and let her drag it around.
2. When you see her chewing something she shouldn’t be
chewing, call your dog to come to you, showing her a
food-filled toy or treat.
3. When she arrives, and if she’s still holding on to her
prize, tell her to drop it, using a stern tone of voice to
prove you mean it and you’re not playing her game.
4. Show her the alternative, dangling it in front of her face
just as she tantalized you with the shoe.
She’ll smell the delectable toy. Because dogs tend to have a
high food drive, they usually choose the food over a yucky
tasting shoe any day.
5. When the shoe falls from her mouth she’ll try to grab 
the toy.
Don’t let her grab the treat. Your mixed breed must earn
this toy, not be rewarded for initiating a game of tag with
your shoe.
6. Have her perform something such as a Sit.
7. When she does so, praise her and give her the food-
filled toy.
What happens if you can’t find something that your dog would rather
have than that cigarette butt she picked up from the street, or the
steak she filched from the counter? You have to teach her the mean-
ing of Drop It. This command will be important when your dog steals
your dinner, and it will protect your mixed breed from poisoning her-
self. You can also use it to teach your dog to retrieve a toy and return
it to your hand instead of chasing her down to do another throw.
Here’s how you teach Drop It:
1. Put a leash on your dog so you can back up your 
commands without having to chase her around.
Allow the leash to drag on the ground until needed.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 179

2. Create the situation by either throwing a favorite toy 
a short distance or merely dropping it.
3. When your mixed breed picks up the toy, bring her to
you via the leash.
Praise her as she comes closer so that she always believes
coming to you is a great idea.
4. Tell her to sit.
If she doesn’t do so on her own, place her into position.
Again praise, even if you had to place her.
5. Now, tell her “Drop it,” as you hold your hand just
beneath her jaw.
You can be sure she won’t, because she already has a
prized possession that is more rewarding than whatever
you can offer.
6. Place your other hand over the top of her muzzle, with
fingers on either side of her lips and squeeze her lips 
into her mouth.
Few dogs like to bite their own lips so you will feel her 
jaw releasing.
7. As your dog’s jaw slackens, praise her.
8. When she drops the toy, praise and offer her tasty treats
such as freeze-dried liver or cheese.
When first starting this, always offer a high-value 
replacement.
If you’re having your dog drop one of her toys, you can offer it to
her again so that she learns she isn’t prohibited from playing with
the toy — she just has to give it to you upon your request.
From Beggar to Chooser: 
Getting Your Dog to Stop 
Begging at the Table
How many times have you sat down to eat dinner only to have
your dog, or someone else’s dog climb onto you or grab something
from your plate? Annoying, right?
You can be sure most dogs also prefer to eat in peace, but the mere
act of eating overcomes their desire to be peaceful. Many mixed-
breed dogs who’ve experienced starvation or neglect will strive to
Part III: Training 101 
180

get food in any way they can. Without learning boundaries, they’ll
grab at anything that has a tempting odor.
Spoiled dogs have learned that sitting at your chair, salivating,
staring, whining, putting a paw on your leg, or outright demanding
the food with loud barking will always earn them a reward from
your plate. You may have given the dog something to keep her
quiet, or you thought she’d like that little piece of leftover steak.
Instead of placating your dog, you’re creating a begging monster.
Some dogs are very sneaky about getting their stolen goods.
They’re the counter surfers. Beware of leaving dinner on the
counter to cool — it’ll be gone before you return. You’ll know the
counter surfer — she keeps her nose in the air as she walks along
the counters in the kitchen. Nothing is safe!
You can prevent your dog from begging for food (or stealing it!) in
several ways:
 Never feed from the table or counter.
 Always make your dog earn her food. She must at the very
least sit before receiving anything, including her dinner.
 Teach your dog how to go to a specific place while you and
others eat at the table. If you place a food-filled toy on a pad
or bed nearby, your dog will be lured to the spot and
rewarded for remaining there.
 Have a specific area where your mixed breed is fed her
meals so that she learns that the only place she eats meals 
is at her special place.
Nipping and Mouthing
Mouthing is a lighter form of nipping, common with dogs who are
playing with each other. However, as a dog mouthing can become
more serious — a means of dominating and controlling. Nipping is
started through play. If allowed to continue, however, it can turn
into aggressive domination.
Both of these infractions with the mouth must be stopped. At no
time should a dog be allowed to put its mouth on you except to
lick, which is a submissive sort of group hug gesture. Allowing 
even a light mouthing is setting yourself up for some serious 
issues down the road.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 181

Understanding why dogs 
nip and mouth
Dogs use their mouths as you use your hands. They grab, hold,
pull, and carry.
Mixed-breed dogs who have spent any time fending for themselves
in the wild, or who have learned to fight for food, shelter, or terri-
tory, tend to use their mouths to get what they want.
Mouthing and nipping is also a very common puppy game. Dogs
use their mouths to explore and to test a playmate for pack posi-
tion. If they’re still with their mom and littermates, they quickly
learn that mom won’t put up with it. She’ll grab their little faces
and growl. Littermates will either respond by yipping, or run away
from that awful hurtful sibling. Either way, there’s a response. How
you respond will have a lot to do with whether Princess will con-
tinue the behavior.
Preventing the problem
Prevention is the most important means of teaching your mixed
breed to not put her mouth on you. Here are a few ways to keep
your dog’s mouth occupied:
 Have lots of toys around for her to put her mouth on.
 Never play with her mouth.
 If you’re playing with her with a toy, the moment she touches
you with her mouth the game is over for a little while.
 Never allow anyone to dangle their hands near her face.
 Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise so that she’s not
nipping at you trying to instigate play.
Curing the problem
Your best bet is to be like mom. I’m not saying to grab your dog’s
head in your mouth as you growl — you’ll be spitting out dog hair
for a month. Instead, use your hands, your eyes, and your body.
Never, ever hit your dog!. Mother dog never hits her pups. Even
fighting dogs don’t hit each other. There are several ways to use
your hands to make your point.
Part III: Training 101 
182

Begin by trying to earn your pup’s sympathy when you she mouths
or nips you. Squeal, “Yipe! Ouch!” Then, whatever you were doing
with your dog — a game of fetch, tug, or leg pulling — stop the game.
If your mixed breed has no sympathy for your pain, you’ll need 
to take the mom approach. Put a hand on either side of her head,
taking firm hold of her neck scruff. Hold her in place and stare her
in the eyes as you growl at her. The moment she blinks or other-
wise looks away, let go. Make her do something for you such as a
sit. Praise and reward her good behavior.
If the grabbing hold of her neck scruff doesn’t work, follow 
these steps:
1. Put a hand on each side of your dog’s neck and hold
firmly.
2. Stare into her eyes, growl at her, and roll her over onto
her back.
3. Continue the stare and growl.
4. When your dog shows submission by turning her eyes
away from you, blinking, and going limp, slowly release
her neck and allow her to get up.
5. If she goes back to nipping at you, pin her down again.
Repeat this as often and as long as necessary to make your
point. It may be a long hold the first couple times, but the
length will decrease as your dog realizes that you have no
breaking point and she must be the first to give up.
As with all severe behavior problems, talk to a professional trainer or
behaviorist. Nipping and mouthing are not easy to contend with, and
implementing the wrong correction can have severe consequences.
Digging to the Center of the Earth
Dogs love digging, but people hate stepping in holes — and having
to fill them. Even worse, people hate what a digging dog does to
their yard.
Why in the world would your mixed breed choose to dig against
the house foundation? Why would she make trenches throughout
the yard? Why is she totally thrilled to show up at the door cov-
ered in dirt, grass stains, and twigs while wearing a huge smile? In
this section, I uncover the mystery of why your dog digs, and tell
you what you can do about it.
Chapter 12: Tackling Mixed-Breed Training Challenges 183

Knowing why dogs dig
Dogs dig for many reasons, the most common is that it’s fun and
might yield a snack or two. Who says dead worms and bugs aren’t
delicacies? Look at it from your dog’s point of view:
 Digging is less boring than lying in the shade. Plus, digging
is great exercise.
 There might be something edible to go along with a scent.
Who knows what lies beneath the surface? Gotta dig to find out.
 Dogs feel earth vibrations. Moles and other underground
critters make lots of vibrations. Trenching is a great means 
of following their paths.
 Holes are often cooler to lie in than surface dirt — never
mind that the current hole used to contain an azalea. The
azalea had a prime resting spot.
Digging is a very natural canine behavior — one that cannot and
should not be prohibited. Without the chance to dig, you’re setting
up your dog for failure in other areas of her life, such as proper
house manners.
Giving your dog a place to dig
Instead of just screaming at your dog to stop turning your yard into
a lunar landscape, give her an alternative. Give her a place where
digging is appropriate. If your dog is primarily an indoor dog, a pile
of blankets will work fine. A box filled with sand, wood chips, or
mulch works well, too. Isn’t this better than holes in your carpet?
If your mixed breed is allowed to exercise outdoors in a safely
fenced area, think on a broader scale. Here are a couple suggestions:
 Separate your dog’s yard from your garden.
 Give your dog a place to dig such as a sand box or pile 
of mulch.
 Fence off your plants so that your dog can’t get near enough
to dig them up.
 Fill existing holes and pour vinegar around them so they
become less attractive for future digging. Put your dog’s
feces in the hole prior to filling.
Redirection of the digging habit will help teach your dog that she
has her own place to play. Without this, your dog will continue to
Part III: Training 101 
184

dig by your house foundation or under the bushes because it
offered some type of reward — a cool place to lie or great exercise.
You can’t expect your mixed breed to change her digging location
without your help. You’ll have to prove to her that the sand pile
will offer greater rewards than beneath the English Boxwood.
Here’s a great means of redirection:
1. Half-bury a favorite toy or biscuit in the place where you
want her to dig.
2. Guide your dog to the buried toy and point it out.
3. Praise her if she goes for the toy or eats the treat.
4. Repeat this many times until your mixed breed runs
straight for her digging area each time she goes outside.
Spend time with your dog in her digging area. Praise your dog
when she puts her nose to the sand and even more when she
begins pushing her feet into it.
You can try several materials — including sand, mulch, wood chips
or topsoil — for your dog’s digging area. You want to entice your
dog to dig in a special location so use whatever your dog prefers;
otherwise, she’ll return her attentions to under the hedges.
If your dog is digging holes to escape the heat, provide other 
outlets for cooling down:
 A small child’s pool filled with cool water
 A dog door so that your mixed breed can come inside and lie
on a cool basement or kitchen floor
 A doghouse with a fan to cool the interior
 A dog bed that can be soaked in water to maintain a lower
body temperature

 Giving your dog regular healthcare
 Dealing with chronic health issues
O
ne of the most important things you can do as the owner 
of a mixed-breed dog is to obtain the services of a reputable 
and dog-friendly veterinarian. Just as not every doctor is right for
you, not every vet is right for your dog. In this chapter, I walk you
through finding a good vet and fill you in on some key issues sur-
rounding your dog’s health, including spaying/neutering, getting reg-
ular checkups, and alternative treatments that may help your dog.
Choosing a Veterinarian
Your local Yellow Pages lists the names and numbers of numerous
veterinarians. The tough part is deciding which one to take your
dog to. Convenience may play a big part in your ultimate decision
(you’d probably rather go to a vet who’s closer to your house than
all the way across town), but the most important factors when
choosing a vet should be the vet’s reputation, the clinic’s facilities,
and the vet’s specialties.
You don’t have to get all your veterinary services from one loca-
tion. For example, I use the services of a local vet for my animals’
regular checkups, vaccinations, and stomach upsets. But when it
was time for my male dog to be neutered, I took him to another vet
because he was the only one within an hour radius who performed

laser surgery, and that’s what I wanted for my dog. Not every vet-
erinarian can specialize in everything — just as not every doctor
can specialize in everything.
The best way to choose a vet is to talk to other pet owners in your
area. Check with your family members, neighbors, and friends who
have pets — they may be able to give you a referral to one they trust,
or let you know of those with whom they had negative experiences.
Here’s what to look for in a veterinary clinic:
 A friendly staff: The receptionist who answers the phone the
very first time you call should be friendly, as should every
person you come into contact with at the clinic, from the vet
tech on up to the veterinarian.
 A clean waiting room and exam room: If the clinic can’t be
bothered to keep the areas of the office that you see clean,
imagine what it’s like in the back, where they take your dog
for shots or medical treatment.
 Efficient recordkeeping: You want to be sure that your vet
has a complete record of your dog’s health and can access it
at a moment’s notice.
 Knowledgeable and helpful assistants and veterinarians:
You want to be sure that your questions are treated with
respect and that you get the answers you need. You don’t
want to feel rushed through your appointment or as though
the vet doesn’t have enough time for you.
When you’re looking for a vet, you’ll need to decide whether to
take your dog to a doctor who works alone, or to a larger clinic
where multiple vets are on staff. Table 13-1 lists the pros and cons
of each.

may specialize in different 
areas, such as nutrition or 
holistic treatments, and you 
can see whichever vet’s 
knowledge you need at the 
time, with your records all in 
one place.
Here’s a list of questions you can ask a vet to help you determine
whether that vet is right for you:
 What vaccinations do you recommend and how often
should they be given? Many veterinarians prefer to practice
only traditional methods — and traditionally, dogs have been
vaccinated once a year, whether they need the vaccine or not.
Newer approaches involve blood tests to determine whether
the vaccine is needed.
 Where do you send clients who require specialists for their
dogs? You want to make sure that your vet can answer this
question and refers her patients to specialists she trusts. You
also want to pay attention to how far away that specialist is
and, if it seems farther than you’d normally want to have to
travel, ask if there’s a reason for referring patients so far away.
Maybe that vet is the best one in the state, and she only trusts
her patients with the best. Or maybe she just doesn’t know
anyone else. Obviously, the former would be a better answer
than the latter.
 Do you offer alternative or homeopathic approaches?
If you don’t care about alternative therapies and you’re a
straight-by-the-book kind of a person, this won’t matter to
you. But if you’d like to consider alternative approaches, the
vet’s answer will make a huge difference. Whether your vet
offers these alternatives or not, you want a vet who doesn’t
dismiss them as whacko.
Chapter 13: Finding and Working with a Vet 191

Homeopathy operates on the assumption that like heals like.
Similar to traditional vaccines that utilize killed or low doses 
of live germs to create antibodies, homeopathic remedies take
the same path of administering diluted substances to help the
dog heal. The dilution is done in several stages to prevent side
effects. These remedies come in tablets, powders, liquids, and
ointments. Though they’re readily available at health-food
stores and online, it’s best to consult with a veterinarian who
is familiar with alternative medicine in order to know the cor-
rect substances, dilutions, and doses to give your dog.
 What are your hours? Make sure that the vet is open hours
that are convenient for your life and schedule.
 Are you available in emergencies? If not, what arrangements
have you made for your patients? You probably can’t expect
your vet to be available at all hours of the day or night, but
you can and should expect your vet to have a number you can
call in case of after-hours emergencies. It may be a 24-hour vet-
erinary hospital in your area or the number of another vet
who’s covering her emergencies while she’s out of town.
 If my dog is sick, will you tell me all my treatment options
and their costs, and let me make the decision that’s right 
for me financially and emotionally? One of the worst parts
about owning a dog is having to make decisions about how 
far you’ll go, and how much you’ll spend, to save his life.
Some vets believe that anything and everything should be
done, and they may make you feel guilty if you question
whether a particular treatment is necessary. You want a vet
who will respect your decisions and not make you feel like a
horrible person for not spending thousands and thousands of
dollars to save your dog’s life — unless you have the means
to. It’s bad enough to have to lose your dog without having to
deal with a vet’s guilt trip in the process.
 When you visit the vet, does she answer all your questions
in an easy-to-understand manner and make the effort to
fully explain your dogs’ health issues?
Spaying or Neutering Your Pet
Spaying or neutering your dog should be number one on your list
of priorities if it hasn’t yet been done. Part of being a responsible
guardian of a mixed-breed dog is controlling the pet population by
spaying or neutering. If you’re not convinced of the need to spay or
neuter your dog, see Chapter 18.
The procedure really doesn’t take much time, but it is surgery, so
your vet will recommend not feeding or giving your mixed breed
any water within 12 hours of the surgery. (If your vet’s guidelines
differ from these, do what your vet says.)
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
192

After surgery, you’ll need to keep your dog quiet for a couple days,
to give him some time to heal (whether the procedure was done
traditionally or via laser surgery). Don’t let your dog jump or race
around within a week after surgery.
Some dogs will lick or bite at the incision area as it heals, because
it can be very itchy. You can prevent this biting and itching in a 
few ways:
 Put a soft Elizabethan or hard plastic Elizabethan (cone-
shaped) collar on your dog. With one of these contraptions
on, your dog won’t be able to reach beneath him to bite at the
incision area. He’ll try, of course — and he’ll bump that collar
on everything he passes. He walks by the end table — bump.
He walks by the coffee table — swish go the magazines to the
floor. No dog likes wearing one of these collars, but keeping
him from biting or licking his incision is critical, so just
remember that it’s only for a week or so.
 Rub a product called Bitter Apple around the area. I usually
apply antibacterial cream directly on the wound and around it,
and then I apply the Bitter Apple on top of that. With such a hor-
rible flavor, your dog is sure to not mess with his incision area.
You will need to reapply the Bitter Apple several times each day.
No matter what, keep that incision area clean. After your dog
goes outside (and remember to keep the play to a minimum),
clean the area with a disinfectant solution such as Nolvasan and
then reapply the antibacterial cream and Bitter Apple over that.
Microchipping or Tattooing:
Keeping Your Dog Safe
I think having some form of identification on your dog is 
mandatory — I don’t care if he spends every minute of every 
day at your side. In many areas, the law requires every dog to 
have a rabies tag, license tag, and some form of ID tag that bears
the owner’s name and phone number. Whether the law in your 
area requires it or not, it’s the only thing to do. If your dog runs
away and is taken to a local animal shelter, he could be euthanized
if you don’t claim him within a few days. Identification helps the
authorities find you in case you can’t find your dog.
Unfortunately, all this bling can fall off and get lost. I can’t count the
number of ID tags I’ve had to replace throughout each of my dogs’
lives. That’s why every one of my dogs either has a tattoo or has been
implanted with a microchip. Here’s more on each of these methods:
Chapter 13: Finding and Working with a Vet 193

 Tattooing: A tattoo is usually done on the inside of your dog’s
hind leg. It takes about five to ten minutes when done by a
professional canine tattoo artist or a vet familiar with the
techniques. You can choose what to have imprinted on your
dog’s skin — it can be your driver’s license number, your
Social Security number, or a number that you register with a
national organization such as the National Dog Registry (www.
nationaldogregistry.com). Tattoos are easily seen, and if
your dog is every lost, you’ll be notified. Plus, a tattoo is an
outward sign to the people who find your dog that you’re 
serious about holding on to him for life.
 Microchipping: Microchipping is the latest technology for
identifying not only pets but also farm animals and people. A
microchip is embedded beneath the dog’s skin in the shoulder
region. It’s as easy as an injection, though the needle is a little
larger than the kind they use for a vaccination. The microchip
contains encoded information, usually a registration number
that coincides with your contact information. Most animal
shelters, humane societies, and vet clinics own microchip
scanners, which can detect the microchip and read the infor-
mation on it. If your dog decides to take a walk and ends up at
one of these places, you’ll be contacted.
Keeping Up with Regular
Healthcare
Yearly checkups and vaccinations are important for your dog, espe-
cially when he’s less than a year of age or older than 6 or 7 years of
age. You never know what a young pup can get into, and aging dogs
tend to develop problems that may not be immediately recognizable.
Not all dogs require yearly vaccinations. After your dog is about 3
years old, your vet can do yearly blood tests to check whether his
previous vaccinations are still protecting him. This is called a titer test.
Regular checkups and 
yearly vaccinations
When you bring your mixed breed to your vet for his yearly exam,
he’ll not only be vaccinated (if necessary), but he’ll get a thorough
checkup. Your vet will examine his abdomen for lumps and sensi-
tivity, take his temperature, and check his eyes, ears, teeth, and
throat. Some vets like to watch the dog in motion; others manipu-
late their legs and neck, checking for signs of injury or sensitivity.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
194

Only one vaccination is mandatory on a yearly schedule. The
rabies vaccine is required by law in every state. The first year it’s
given it is only considered viable for one year. Every vaccination
after the first one is usually viable for three years. Your vet will
know the laws in your area.
For your mixed breed’s first three years, he should also get the 
following vaccinations annually:
 Coronavirus: This illness causes diarrhea and dehydration.
It’s highly contagious, especially among young and very old
dogs. It’s not often fatal, though it can be debilitating.
 Distemper: This illness is a very common one among feral
(wild) animals. Symptoms include ocular and nasal discharge.
In more severe cases, coughing, vomiting, and fever.
Untreated, it’s often fatal.
 Hepatitis: Recognizing this illness is difficult — the signs are
fever and lethargy, though sometimes there’s vomiting and
diarrhea, too. It is easily spread through the feces and urine 
of an infected dog. If it’s not caught in time, it’s fatal, so vacci-
nating makes sense.
 Leptospirosis: A dog with this illness will have a fever, will
vomit, and won’t want to move around much. Leptospirosis 
is often contracted through the urine of rodents, so if your
mixed breed has some varmint-chasing instincts, beware if he
displays these symptoms. Renal failure often results from this
illness, as does sudden death. If you live in an area where your
dog may be exposed to rodents, make sure he’s vaccinated.
 Parvovirus: This disease is highly contagious and potentially
fatal. It’s common in feral animals and easily transmitted from
dog to dog. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, vomiting,
fever, and lethargy. Caught in time, dogs often recover with
treatment. In young puppies, however, the disease can be
fatal. This vaccination is one of the first that puppies must
have; they should also should get three sets of booster shots
spaced two to four weeks apart to protect them.
There are other vaccinations that aren’t as vital, but that are still
important for your dog’s protection. These include
 Bordetella (for kennel cough): You’ll only really need the 
bordetella vaccine if you’re planning on exposing your mixed
breed to other dogs (for example, in a boarding kennel or in 
a dog park — and most kennels require proof of vaccination),
but if you’re of the better-safe-than-sorry mindset, you might
vaccinate him no matter what.
Chapter 13: Finding and Working with a Vet 195

 Lyme disease (to prevent infection of the tick-borne disease):
Within ticks’ saliva are several fatal diseases, and Lyme dis-
ease is one of them. The symptoms for Lyme disease include
lethargy, loss of appetite, and lameness. It’s easily treated with
antibiotics, if caught in time. If not, the result can be perma-
nent lameness or death. Why chance it?
Baseline tests
A baseline test is just a simple blood test that gives your vet an
idea of what constitutes normal function for your dog. If you have
one done while your dog is healthy, it’ll be a great way of informing
your vet of age-related or illness-related changes in your dog down
the road.
I always have baseline tests done on my dogs prior to sterilization
surgery, to make sure my dogs didn’t have any heart or blood
problems that might risk their lives while on the operating table.
As a dog ages, baseline testing should be done yearly to diagnose
any life-threatening or debilitating diseases at an early stage.
Controlling parasites
Modern veterinary medicine now offers many ways to prevent par-
asite infestation. On your first visit to your vet, be sure to discuss
this. Your vet will prescribe the appropriate preventative for his
size and age. If your dog has parasites, he’ll be treated for them.
If you got your dog from a shelter, chances are, he’s infested with
parasites inside and out. If your mixed breed has internal parasites,
your vet can treat them through an injection or oral medication. If
your dog has external parasites (such as fleas or ticks), he can be
given Capstar an oral medication that quickly and safely kills all live
adult fleas within 2 hours. After four hours a regular bath will wash
out the dead the bugs and clear his skin of the parasites entirely. At
that point you can apply a topical flea preventative.
Preventing parasite infestation is your job — believe me, your dog
will thank you for it. For heartworm prevention, give your mixed
breed the monthly tablet prescribed by his vet. For flea and tick
prevention, any number of great topical preventives are available.
Talk with your vet to find out exactly which parasites they repel or
kill and see which one your vet recommends.
If your dog gets bathed a lot, you’ll want to reapply the topical 
preventative more often than the package suggests.

Addressing Special 
Health Problems
Not every dog is in perfect health all the time — just as not every
human being is in perfect health all the time. Though some dogs
display health sensitivities as pups, others may not develop them
until they get older. In the following sections, I walk you through
some of the most common problems dogs develop and tell you
what to expect in terms of treatment and prevention.
Skin allergies
Dogs are commonly allergic to flea and tick bites. One bite is all it
takes to drive your mixed breed crazy. Multiple bites will cause his
fur to fall out, his skin to thicken and redden, and constant scratch-
ing, biting, and discomfort.
Skin allergies also occur when dogs eat something that doesn’t
agree with them. Some have allergies to lawn treatments or 
specific types of grasses or plants.
The only way to determine the exact cause of the problem is 
to take your mixed breed to a veterinary specialist for testing.
Knowing what is causing the problem will help you remove it from
your dog’s environment and speed his healing process. Plus, it’ll
help you prevent your dog from having the same reaction again.
Food allergies
With all the ingredients that go into commercial dog foods, it’s no
wonder that some dogs have allergies — with every additional
ingredient, there’s an additional item that the dog may be allergic
to. From dyes and preservatives, to using multiple grains as fillers,
any number of these can cause dry skin, itching, runny eyes, and
behavioral anomalies.
Your vet will have some suggestions of food brands or homemade
meals that will help pinpoint the sources of your dog’s allergies
and offer your dog a wholesome diet. Consult with a holistic veteri-
narian or veterinary dermatologist about food allergies, too —
she’ll have some good insight into the most common foods that
cause allergic reactions in dogs, such as wheat, corn, beef, chicken,
and rice, among others.
Chapter 13: Finding and Working with a Vet 197

Appetite issues
More dogs have obesity issues than poor-skinny-waif problems.
Just as our human society overeats and goes for the extra-large
portions of fast food, many dog owners are taking the same
approach with their dogs. Overeating is just as dangerous for
canines as it is for humans.
Your vet will know whether your dog is a correct weight. Although
your vet can let you know your dog is overweight, it’s up to you to
do something about it. You can
 Change his diet to a lower-calorie one.
 Reduce the amount you feed him by half and substitute with
raw vegetables. This will give him the fiber he needs without
the calories he doesn’t need.
 Make sure he’s getting enough exercise.
If your dog is underweight or stops eating, take him to the vet right
away. Dogs only refuse to eat when they’re very sick. There’s a
reason for his skipping meals, and it could be very serious. Let
your vet examine your dog to discover what’s going on.
If there’s absolutely nothing wrong with your mixed breed and 
he still doesn’t want to eat, try adding some flavorful gravy to his
meals. Adding canned food and mixing it into the kibble can also
be helpful in generating interest. Maybe just changing his food 
altogether to something that’s richer, more aromatic, and more 
flavorful will do the trick.
Skeletal disorders
Skeletal disorders can be caused by accidental injury or genetic
inheritance. Either way, your vet will need to do a thorough exam
and take X-rays to discover the source of discomfort.
If the problem is degenerative (that is, it happens over time, as 
the dog ages — such as osteoarthritis), the inflammation can be
controlled by several different prescription medications. The one
chosen will be based on the dog’s age, size, and possible breed
combination — not all medications work well with all dog breeds.
You can also use supplements such as glucosamine and chon-
droitin to help control the fluid levels between the joints and
reduce inflammation in the tissue surrounding the joints. If your
vet isn’t familiar with these supplements, talk to a holistic veteri-
narian or find another vet who is.

First Aid: Dealing with
Emergencies
In This Chapter
 Being prepared for any emergency
 Knowing who to call for help
 Getting your lost dog back
You could have your dog from puppyhood to old age and 
never encounter an emergency situation — or you could face
numerous emergencies throughout your dog’s life. You don’t know
if or when emergency will strike, but being prepared for any disas-
ter puts you ahead of the game. In this chapter, I help you recog-
nize emergency situations, tell you the basics of canine first aid,
and help you find your dog if you ever lose her. Read this chapter
while your dog is safe and sound, and tuck the information away
for when you need it. It could save your dog’s life.
Gathering Emergency 
Contact Information
There are several numbers you should always have handy in case
of emergencies. Make several photocopies of this page and fill in
Table 14-1 with all the appropriate numbers. Then keep one copy
on your refrigerator, another in each of your cars, another in your
canine first-aid kit . . . you get the idea. Just make sure the numbers
are easily accessible no matter where you are.
I’ve left several blank rows at the bottom of the table, where you
can add the names and numbers of family members or friends who
can help you out in case of emergency. (It’s amazing how, in an
emergency, you can forget phone numbers that you otherwise
have memorized.)

Preparing for natural disasters
No matter where you live, natural disasters can strike. Being prepared is essential.
Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 Don’t rely on anyone other than yourself to evacuate your pet. City officials and
workers will not take on this responsibility.
 Don’t leave your dog tied up outside. If your dog is tied, she can’t escape water,
flying debris, wind, and other things that threaten her life.
 Don’t leave your dog indoors. If there’s a tidal surge and your house is under
water, your dog can drown.
 If you’re evacuating in advance of a hurricane and you plan on leaving your dog
at a kennel, don’t do so anywhere within the hurricane strike zone. As part of
your preparation, get contact information for kennels in other states.
 Prepare a secure, unbreakable covered pet carrier, marked with your name,
address, and phone number. Include two leashes and a harness/collar with your
name, address, and phone number on a tag. Bring plastic bowls for food and
water; in waterproof plastic containers, put enough food for two weeks. Bring
a copy of your pet’s health records, her medication, a current photo, plastic bags
for waste, and a couple toys to keep her occupied.

Assembling Your Canine 
First-Aid Kit
Following are all the items you need in a basic, in-home first-aid kit.
Though you may not need all the items listed here at any one time
in your mixed breed’s life, it’s a good idea to at least own them and
know where you keep them.
 First-aid book
 Adhesive tape or self-sticking Vet Wrap (as of this printing,
you can actually buy Vet Wrap online at Amazon.com)
 Cotton balls
 Square gauze pads, 3 x 3 inches
 Instant hot/cold packs
 Cotton-tipped applicators (like Q-tips)
 Antibacterial ointment (like Neosporin or Bacitracin)
 Bitter Apple cream and/or spray
 Hydrogen peroxide
 Clotisol (clotting cream)
 Hydrogen peroxide
 Activated charcoal (in case of poisoning)
 Tweezers and small, sharp scissors
 Thermometer (Note: A dog’s normal temperature is 101°F. 
You can buy ear thermometers for pets at most major pet-
supply stores.)
 Aloe-vera gel (to sooth scrapes and cuts)
 Canine antidiarrhea medication (such as Metronidazole, an
antibiotic available from your veterinarian) (Note: Human
over-the-counter antidiarrhea medications often don’t work 
at all with dogs.)
 Rubber gloves
 Muzzle (Note: Many injured dogs bite first and ask 
questions later.)
 Something you can use for a stretcher, such as a board, 
blanket, or floor mat
Chapter 14: First Aid: Dealing with Emergencies 201

If you’re hiking, camping, boating, or engaging in some other out-
door activities with your dog, place the following items in a zip-top
plastic bag and toss it in your backpack:
 Fresh water, at least 1 pint
 Antiseptic wipes
 Sterile gauze pads
 Antibacterial ointment
 Vet Wrap
 Bite/sting stop
 Tweezers
If you’re interested, you can take courses in first aid and canine CPR.
One exceptional source for these is Pet Tech (www.pettech.net),
which offers information, pet-saver training, DVDs, and pet first 
aid instructors’ courses. Books such as First Aid for Dogs: What to 
Do When Emergencies Happen, by Bruce Fogle, and The First Aid
Companion for Dogs & Cats, by Amy D. Shojai, are also good sources.
First-Aid Basics
Dogs tend to be inquisitive, which can often get them into trouble.
No matter where you live, your dog could have an accident, get
sick, or get hurt. Few dogs go through life without some physical
trauma. In the following sections, I cover the majority of situations,
how to recognize them, and what to do if they happen to your dog.
Allergies
Allergies manifest themselves in many ways. The most likely allergic
reactions are those to food ingredients, though I’ve known some
dogs who are also allergic to specific types of grass, plants, or
indoor fabrics, such as carpeting, upholstery, or window treatments.
When your mixed breed is experiencing an allergic reaction, she may
begin sneezing, wheezing, choking, or gagging. She may also develop
an itchy rash on her skin. Some dogs will lick and chew themselves.
Ear infections can be common symptoms of allergies as well.
If you suspect that your dog has an allergy, you can either take her
to a specialist and find out exactly the cause of the allergic reac-
tion, or you can change her diet and see if you notice an improve-
ment before consulting with a vet. If the allergies are due to your
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
202

mixed breed’s environment, you may have to remove some items
from her living space.
The only way of knowing for sure what your dog is allergic to is by
taking her to an allergy specialist and having her tested.
Bloat
Bloat is a swelling of the stomach from gas, fluid, or both. It tends
to occur in dogs with large chest cavities, like Great Danes or
Weimaraners, who also like to inhale their food quickly. Dogs 
prone to this ailment may bloat if they eat immediately after
extreme exercise.
The symptoms of bloat include pacing continuously or lying down
in odd places, panting, whining, salivating, and agitation. The dog
may vomit without anything coming up. She’ll drool excessively,
make retching noises, and have swelling in the abdominal area.
Bloat is potentially fatal, and there’s nothing you can do for your
dog to help her other than to recognize the symptoms and get her
to the vet immediately. Surgery must be performed to save her life.
Bloat has a 30-percent fatality rate, mostly due to dog owners who
either don’t recognize the symptoms or are too slow to react.
Broken bones or dislocations
You can never be sure whether your dog has broken or dislocated
a bone without the help of your vet. The only symptoms you’ll be
able to recognize are your dog being unable to use a limb or the
limb appearing to be at an odd angle. If the dog has a rib, shoulder,
hip, or back fracture, she may not move at all.
If bleeding is involved, try to control it (see “Puncture wounds,”
later in this chapter, for tips on controlling bleeding), but don’t 
try to fix the fracture. Protect the area with cotton padding. If it’s 
a limb, apply a splint of some sort (two long pieces of wood) and
secure them with bandaging such as Vet Wrap. Carefully place your
dog on a makeshift stretcher — a rug, blanket, or wide board will
work — so that she won’t further injure herself by moving. Take
her to her vet immediately.
Some injured animals are prone to aggression, due to stress and
pain, so I recommend muzzling your dog before applying the
splint. Not only will this prevent injury to you but it will prevent
further injury to the dog.
Chapter 14: First Aid: Dealing with Emergencies 203

Burns
You’ll know your dog is burned if you see singed fur, blistering, red-
ness of skin, and/or swelling. Take your dog to the vet immediately.
If you have someone who can drive while you flush your dog’s
injury with cool water that would be ideal. If not, just go to your
vet immediately.
Choking
You’ll recognize the symptoms of choking by noticing that your
dog is having difficulty breathing or swallowing. She might paw at
her mouth, and her lips and tongue could turn blue from lack of
blood flow.
Look inside your dog’s mouth and throat. Clear it by using pliers or
tweezers — if you stick your finger down her throat, you can easily
lodge the object farther down her throat.
If the object is too deep and you can’t get it, perform the Heimlich
maneuver by putting your hands on either side of your dog’s rib cage
and applying firm, quick pressure. Another way you can perform this
is to place your dog on her side and press against her rib cage with
the palm of your hand. Repeat until the object is dislodged.
Get someone to take you and your dog to a vet as you are doing
the Heimlich. You may not be able to totally dislodge the entire
object, and the sooner you can get veterinary attention, the better
chance your dog has of surviving.
Cuts
Wash the area with cool water and pat dry. Apply hydrogen perox-
ide to the area. If it has stopped bleeding (and after the area is
dry), apply an antibacterial ointment and then spread a little Bitter
Apple ointment around the edges (not in the cut) to prevent your
dog from licking off the ointment.
If the wound is deep or doesn’t stop bleeding, apply a pressure
bandage and take your dog to the vet immediately.
Diarrhea
If your dog has diarrhea, the best thing to do is to withhold food
from your dog for 12 to 24 hours. Give her plenty of ice cubes and
water — she’ll need to stay hydrated.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
204

Some dogs get diarrhea after eating something that doesn’t agree
with them, so after that initial 12 to 24 hours, keep your dog on a
bland diet of boiled rice and chicken, or beef (as long as she’s not
allergic to these ingredients) for a couple days and gradually trans-
fer her back to her normal food.
If the diarrhea doesn’t cease within a day, take your dog to the vet
and bring a stool sample with you for testing. If the consistency of
the diarrhea is mucousy, if it’s light in color, tar black or if it con-
tains blood, take your dog to the veterinarian immediately.
Heat stroke
If your dog has a short nose, heavy fur, or large structure, don’t
exercise her at all in hot weather conditions — her body can’t
handle it. For other dogs, keep all exercise on hot days to a mini-
mum. Stick to allowing your mixed breed to run in early mornings
and late evenings during summer months to prevent any tempera-
ture-related illness.
The symptoms of heat stroke include difficulty breathing, vomiting,
high temperature, and collapse. If the dog isn’t treated immediately,
heat stroke can be fatal.
The best treatment is to immerse your dog in a tub of cool water.
You can also gently soak her with a garden hose or wrap her in a
cool, wet towel. You’ll need to lower her temperature gradually, so
don’t put her in a tub of ice — this could go in the other direction
and cause hypothermia or shock. If she’ll drink, give her some 
electrolyte-supplemented water, such as Smart Water.
Take her temperature often and stop the cooling process when her
temperature reaches 103°F.
Hypothermia
Hypothermia happens when the dog becomes too cold. It’s most
common in small dogs or those with a short coat and no body 
fat. If this describes your mixed breed, be sure to never leave her
outdoors for a prolonged period of time during winter weather
conditions; especially below 35°F.
The symptoms of hypothermia are similar to heat stroke (see the
preceding section), only the dog will be shaking to try to stay warm,
and she’s not likely to vomit. Her limbs will be stiff with cold.
Chapter 14: First Aid: Dealing with Emergencies 205

Wrap her in warm blankets and rub her vigorously to maintain a
healthy blood flow to all parts of her body. Place her on a heating
pad, but be sure to put a towel or blanket between your dog and
the pad to prevent burning.
As with all emergency situations, take your dog to the vet as soon
as you can.
Insect bites
If your dog ventures outdoors at all, you can’t avoid it — she will
be bitten by bugs. Numerous blood-sucking parasites may attack
your dog — including fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes. Some bugs may
sting her, especially if she’s chasing them. Other bugs like to fly
into eyes, ears, or noses, irritating your mixed breed.
If you see swelling or redness, or if you notice your dog scratching
or appearing to be in pain within an hour of the bite, be sure to
investigate it further. If there’s a stinger, try to remove it using
tweezers. Then apply a cold pack for a while to reduce the inflam-
mation. A topical cortisone or anti-inflammatory ointment can be
used on the bite area. Some dogs require oral antihistamines due
to allergic reactions.
If symptoms persist, call your vet.
Poisoning
Dogs will eat nearly anything, so poisoning is always a possibility.
It may be mild (such as eating fallen nuts) or it can be severe (from
eating garden poisons or antifreeze).
The symptoms of poisoning include vomiting, convulsions (in
severe cases), diarrhea, salivation, weakness, depression, or 
collapse. Also in severe cases, if it isn’t caught in time, poisoning
can be fatal.
Give your dog activated charcoal mixed with a small amount of
canned food in the case of poisoning.
If you saw what your dog ate, write it down and try to note the
amount she ingested. Call the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center
at 888-426-4435 (a fee of $55 may be charged to your credit card) and
give the operator the information. Or, if you prefer, call your vet.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
206

Don’t induce vomiting unless your veterinarian directs you to do
so. If the poisoning is topical (on her skin or coat) from substances
such as oil, paint, or chemicals, wash her with a mild soap and
rinse well.
Puncture wounds
Punctures commonly occur when animals fight. They also happen
when dogs go after wild creatures with sharp teeth. If your dog has
gotten into a fight, you may not be able to see all the puncture
wounds unless they’re actively bleeding.
Apply firm direct pressure over any bleeding areas until the bleed-
ing stops. Hold that pressure for ten minutes and don’t bandage it,
because the wound needs air circulation for proper healing. Then
take your dog to the vet for a thorough investigation and treatment.
Many vets will put drains in place to ensure the wounds don’t
become infected and can heal properly from the inside out. The
drains normally remain in place for three days, at which point
they’re removed and the wounds kept clean and dry for another
week. Your dog will likely be on antibiotics for a period of time.
Run-ins with wild animals
If your dog has a run-in with a wild animal, clean the wound with
large amounts of water and dab it with hydrogen peroxide. Any
large, open wound should be wrapped to keep it clean. If it’s a punc-
ture or bleeding profusely, apply pressure until the bleeding stops.
Take your dog to the vet. Saliva has a high concentration of bacteria,
so your dog will need to be given antibiotics to prevent infection.
If your dog has a run-in with a porcupine or foxtails, take her to the
vet to have them removed. Don’t try to remove them yourself.
Seizures
Some dogs inherit seizures, others develop seizures due to poison-
ing or illness. The symptoms include salivation, disorientations,
violent muscle twitching, an inability to control their excretions,
and, sometimes, loss of consciousness.
The first thing you should do if you see these symptoms is to move
your pet away from any objects that may be harmful — furniture,
floor fixtures, children’s toys, and so on.
Chapter 14: First Aid: Dealing with Emergencies 207

Don’t put yourself at risk during your dogs’ seizure. Dogs are apt 
to lash out without control while having a seizure, so don’t try to
restrain her. Time the seizure so that you can tell your veterinarian
how long it lasted. Most last approximately two to three minutes.
If your dog experiences multiple or prolonged seizures, take her 
to the vet immediately; she may have been poisoned and will need
immediate treatment. On your trip to the vet, try to keep your dog
quiet. Speak in a soothing tone and try to prevent her from seeing
anything that might excite her (like another dog).
Shallow wounds
Do you go to see a doctor every time you cut your finger? Probably
not. Unless your wound is deep, you probably just apply hydrogen
peroxide and antibacterial cream, and slap a bandage on it, and go
on with your life. If you’ve got these items for yourself, you have all
you need to treat your dog’s minor wounds.
Always clean a cut or abrasion thoroughly to remove any dirt and
debris. Allow it to dry, then apply hydrogen peroxide (to further
clean the wound). When it’s dry, apply the antibacterial ointment.
Some dogs will lick off the ointment — to prevent this, either apply
a bandage or, if the area can’t be bandaged, apply Bitter Apple
around the wound. She’ll be less likely to lick off the antibacterial
cream again.
Shock
Shock can occur after a serious injury, fright, or a reaction to
extreme temperatures. Shock is a means of the body protecting
itself from trauma, but it can also threaten a dog’s life. The symp-
toms are irregular breathing, white gums, and dilated pupils.
You’ll need to keep your dog gently restrained, warm, and quiet.
Also elevate her lower body.
Take your dog to the veterinarian immediately. Only your veteri-
narian is equipped to treat your dog for shock.
Snake bites
Snake bites are rare but extremely dangerous for your mixed-breed
dog. There are many venomous species that, with one bite or spit 
of venom, can damage your dog’s nerves or body tissue on contact.
Many types of snake bites can be fatal to dogs.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
208

Once bitten, the skin will swell quickly. You’ll notice a skin puncture.
The dog will display pain in the bitten area. All you can do is to clean
the area and rush your dog to the veterinarian to be treated.
Vomiting
Dogs vomit a lot — from mother dogs regurgitating meals for 
puppies to older dogs who enjoy eating grass, vomiting is part 
of a dog’s life.
You don’t need to be concerned about vomiting unless your dog 
is doing it many times throughout the day, or more often than she
normally does. Also be aware of the consistency of the vomit: If it’s
mucousy, there may be a serious problem. If it’s merely a meal that
was eaten too quickly, it’s probably not anything you need to see a
vet for. Sometimes, if the dog is ill, she’ll vomit up her meals. If she
continues vomiting with nothing coming up, you can be certain
there’s something to be concerned about — she could be choking.
If your dog is vomiting her meal, isolate her from other pets to 
prevent possible contagion. Stop feeding her for 12 to 24 hours,
but make sure she gets plenty of water and ice cubes.
Take your dog to the vet to have her checked for disease or any
other possibilities.
If You Lose Your Dog
Although it’s easy to go crazy when you lose your dog, you need to
remain level-headed and calm to give your dog the best chance of
making it back to you safe and sound.
Before your dog is lost: Getting
proper identification
Modern microchipping is the best way of ensuring that, if found,
your dog will be returned to you. A microchip is a small transmit-
ter bearing your name, address, and phone number that is easily
scanned by a handheld device owned by most veterinarians,
humane societies, and animal shelters. The microchip is injected
under your dog’s skin along her shoulders. There is very little dis-
comfort to the dog during the insertion, and it’s a permanent form
of identification, giving you peace of mind.
Chapter 14: First Aid: Dealing with Emergencies 209

Another great way of permanently IDing your dog is a tattoo. A
tattoo does cause some discomfort to your dog during the inking
process, but it lets people know how to contact you if the dog is
found, and it’s highly visible — no scanner is required as with
microchips. Tattoos are often placed on an inner thigh of the dog’s
hind leg. The number inked can be your driver’s license number or
a specific number registered with a national registry. Either way
you will be contacted. As with a microchip, the tattoo cannot be
removed or fall off. Whether your dog has her collar on or not, the
tattoo is with her.
Even though ID tags can either fall off or be removed, I always
make sure my animals have theirs on their collars along with their
rabies tags and licenses. An ID tag should list your name, the city
where you live, and your phone number. You can also get a dog
collar with your information stitched into the material.
What to do when your dog is lost
If your dog is lost, start by contacting your neighbors. Chances are,
they’ve seen your dog and either are holding on to her for you or
saw the direction she went.
If nobody near you saw your dog escape, contact your friends and
family and ask for help searching for your dog. Fill them in on your
dog’s canine friends she hangs out with, a pond she enjoys swim-
ming in, a park she where loves to run. Search all these places.
Most dogs prefer to remain in familiar territory — they just like to
go on social walkabouts from time to time.
If a search of your dog’s favorite places turns up nothing, notify the
local animal-control office and shelters. Often, when people find a
stray dog, that’s the first place they call. Even if nobody has called
yet, leave your name, phone number, and a description of your dog
in case someone calls in the next few days.
If your mixed breed hasn’t been found within 24 hours, make signs
with a recent photo of your dog. Be sure to list your contact infor-
mation, written large and clearly. If you can, offer a small reward.
Don’t specify the amount on the sign — just say, “Reward Offered.”

Chapter 15
The Special Needs 
of Senior Dogs
In This Chapter
 Knowing when your dog becomes a senior
 Caring for your senior dog
 Recognizing age-related health issues
 Knowing when to say goodbye
G
etting old is never easy, but you can make the transition a
smoother one for your mixed-breed dog. In this chapter, I
help you identify when your dog is really a senior, fill you in on 
his special health needs, and give him the kind of care he deserves.
I also cover the most difficult decision of all: knowing when to let
your best friend go.
Owning a dog is full of fun and excitement, and though the aging
process can be sad, if you approach it with the right attitude, it can
be a time for you to connect with your dog on an even deeper level
than you already have.
How Old Is Old: Knowing When
Your Dog Has Earned Senior Status
How will you know when your dog becomes a senior? He’s not
going to suddenly need a cane to walk with. And you won’t need 
to puree his food one day when he was chewing on bones the day
before. In fact, you may not see any outward signs at all. He may
appear the same as he always has, at least for a while.
But over time, you’ll see a huge difference in your dog’s behavior,
movement, physical appearance, and overall health. Age deterio-
rates the bones and muscle tissue; reduces the efficacy of internal

organs; and dulls the senses. If your dog had any serious injuries
when he was younger, the scar tissue surrounding those injuries
will become inflamed. If he has a degenerative disease, such as hip
dysplasia or spondylosis, it will take a firmer hold.
Here are some general guidelines on the aging process in dogs
based on their size:
 Small dogs (up to 20 pounds): Many small dogs live upwards
of 15 years, some as long as 18 to 20 years (though these often
have some Poodle heritage — Poodles generally have a long
lifespan). Small dogs can be considered seniors by the age 
of 11. In human years that’s about 60 years old; for each year
beyond this, they age by 4 human years. So by the age of 12
they’re 64, by the age of 13 they’re 68, and so on.
Though your small dog may be a senior by 11 years, he may not
really show this until a little later. Small dogs aren’t as prone to
joint problems as bigger dogs are, but they do experience organ
malfunction more prominently than their large cousins. Doing
baseline testing (see Chapter 13) will be extremely important to
ensure you catch any health problems early.
 Medium dogs (21 to 50 pounds): Medium dogs tend to live
anywhere from 13 to 15 years. They become seniors by the
age of 9. In human years, this is equal to approximately 58
years old. If your medium-sized mixed breed lives to the age
of 16, he’s equal in human years to an 83-year-old person, so
you can be sure he’ll have slowed down and gotten cranky
about his aches and pains.
 Large dogs (51 to 90 pounds): Large dogs tend to live about 10
to 12 years. They reach senior status by 8 years of age. At this
time, they’re equal to a human who is 61 years old. The arthri-
tis sets in, it’s tougher to move around, and the eyes and hear-
ing get weak. Between the pain of achy bones and lack of seeing
or hearing, they don’t respond as quickly as before. Your dog
isn’t coming when called because of being stubborn — he
didn’t hear you. By the time a large dog is 11 years old, if he
reaches this age, he’s having extreme difficulty moving and
responding to you. This old dog prefers to sleep and eat, and
that’s about it.
 Extra-large dogs (over 90 pounds): Extra-large dogs generally
live about 9 to 10 years. Extra large dogs are considered sen-
iors by the age of 8. Dogs of this size age 7 to 10 years for each
of our human years.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
212

The Early-Bird Special: Feeding
Your Senior Dog
As your mixed breed ages, his body changes. You shouldn’t feed
him the same food in the same manner as when he was a pup. His
metabolism has slowed down with his reduced exercise, and he
won’t need as much food, or the same type of food (with both high
calorie and fat content) as he used to.
Most dog-food brands offer a senior formula. When you’re deciding
which one to buy, look for the following ingredients on the label:
 Vitamins C and E: As your senior dog’s immune system
becomes less efficient with age, he’ll need a diet that contains
a large amount of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. This
will help his immune system operate more efficiently, thereby
reducing his risk of digestive-system problems and the drying
of his skin and coat.
 Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA): Older dogs also need a diet that
contains gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which is an omega-6
fatty acid. This acid is normally produced in your mixed
breed’s liver by the enzyme action on dietary fat. However, 
in older dogs, these GLA levels are diminished. If your dog’s
favorite senior food doesn’t have GLA in it, you can add
borage oil, a natural source of this acid, to your dog’s diet.
You can find borage oil at most vitamin outlets. One tablet is
usually sufficient.
 Fructoligosaccharides (FOS): Older dogs have more frequent
intestinal problems than younger dogs do, so your dog will
need to have a diet containing fructoligosaccharides (FOS).
This is a unique fiber source that aids in maintaining a healthy
bacterial population in his intestines. Beet pulp is a good
source of FOS and provides energy for the cells that line his
intestine, which helps with proper stool formation. It’s often
already added to most commercial senior dog diets.
Don’t feed your senior dog a food with more than three grains —
they’re tough to digest (see Chapter 7).
You probably won’t need to change your mixed breed’s feeding
schedule or how he eats, though it’s always a good idea to elevate
his food bowl at least a little to help the food go down smoother.
This is especially helpful for senior dogs who have trachea prob-
lems, such as a collapsed trachea, making swallowing difficult.
(You can find special elevated feeders at any major pet store or
online pet store.)
Chapter 15: The Special Needs of Senior Dogs 213

As your dog becomes older, make sure you feed him in a quiet
environment where other family pets won’t disturb him. Many
older dogs eat slowly and will feel challenged by the other animals.
Your dog will let you know if you’re feeding him too often: He
simply won’t eat the meal. Don’t fall into the “always hungry” trap
though, or your senior dog will quickly become overweight, which
in turn will stress his heart and skeletal system, shortening his life.
Use It or Lose It: Exercising 
Your Senior Dog
Senior dogs need exercise. Keeping him in shape will help him 
deal with his physical and emotional changes. Exercise maintains
muscle tone, in turn supporting his weakening joints. It also helps
his digestive system and circulatory system.
Don’t keep your dog locked up just because he’s limping from
arthritic joints. This will quickly increase the deterioration.
Exercise promotes healthy bone growth and keeps your mixed
breed happy. A dog who isn’t exercised quickly declines.
Social time with other dogs
Your old mixed breed may not be able to keep up with the younger
pups, but he’ll have fun trying. And it’s not just a matter of having
fun. It’s a type of exercise you can’t offer — unless you’re willing to
lie down on the ground, gnaw on his ear, roll, jump, and chase him.
(I didn’t think so!) But these are all things dogs do when they play.
If your older dog has health issues, such as arthritis or breathing
problems, be cautious with his choice of playmates. Let him play
with a dog who isn’t super-energetic or dominant.
Not only is playing with other dogs good for your old friend, it’s
also good for the younger dogs, because your old dog teaches
them important social skills. Your old dog has been around the
block a few more times than they have, and he has all kinds of
wisdom to pass on to those youngsters.
Walks with you
Your old dog may have a great time playing with other dogs, but
he’d really prefer to spend time with you. Both of you will benefit
from walks together. It’s a healthy, low-impact means of exercise,
and you can hardly have more enjoyable company.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
214

If your older dog can’t rough-house and race around with other
dogs, walking will be his only way of moving around and keeping
his muscles toned. You can regulate his exercise regimen — his
speed, distance, and terrain.
If your mixed-breed dog is arthritic or suffering from an old injury,
walk him on a soft surface (like dirt), not a hard road or sidewalk.
This will cushion each foot fall, making each step less jarring.
Identifying Health Problems
Common to Seniors
There’s no helping it. All our bodies wear down as we age, and
your dog is no different. You can slow down the degeneration with
proper diet and exercise, but ultimately it’s unavoidable. That said,
deterioration is different in each dog. Larger dogs tend to develop
arthritic joints before losing their eyesight or hearing, whereas
smaller dogs are just the opposite.
In the following sections, I walk you through the most common
age-related problems that dogs face.
Hearing loss
It doesn’t matter which breed mixture your dog is when it comes
to hearing loss — deafness is seen in all breeds.
Hearing loss happens either because of damage to the inner-ear
components from an ear infection, from trauma to the head and
nerves, or through the use of various drugs such as the antibiotics
Gentamicin, Neomycin, and Kanamycin. Over time, the ear compo-
nents can also degenerate, causing a gradual deafness.
Your vet can perform tests to discover the extent of your dog’s
hearing loss, but there are ways you can detect the loss of hearing
in your mixed breed on your own. A couple of the main symptoms
are difficulty arousing from sleep and awakening with aggression.
His verbalizations will be higher pitched. And he’ll also have diffi-
culty figuring out where sound is coming from.
Most dogs adjust to this loss of hearing quite well, and there are
ways you can also adjust to it, too. You can begin by using more
visual cues or lights to get your dogs’ attention — laser lights are
great for this.
Chapter 15: The Special Needs of Senior Dogs 215

Blindness
All dogs have decreased vision as they age (and you probably do,
too!) — it can’t be avoided.
Loss of sight is normally due to changes in pupil size and the loss
of focusing correctly. Due to the aging process other disorders and
diseases occur because of the downward shift of eyelid tissues and
atrophy of the orbital fat.
Your dog’s vision may be reduced as he ages, but he’ll easily adjust
to this, and it most likely won’t affect his overall quality of life. You
can help by not changing the furniture around, and not leaving
objects on the floors that he can’t easily detect.
Arthritis
There’s no avoiding arthritis. (Are you sensing a pattern here?) If it
doesn’t occur from an old injury, it most certainly sets in with age.
Arthritis is a disease in which the cartilage in the joints deterio-
rates. Without the cartilage, the bones of the joints rub together,
causing painful movement.
The symptoms of arthritis are obvious: difficulty walking; limping;
a stiff, slow, ungainly gait. Sometimes you can hear a dog’s joints
creaking and crackling. You may even hear your dog’s nails scrap-
ing against the floor as he walks.
There are many ways you can help your arthritic dog. Exercise
helps maintain mobility and flexibility. You don’t want to push 
your dog too much, but one or two very short walks a day (maybe
around the block) will keep him moving. (You’re better off breaking
his walks into multiple sessions instead of taking one long walk.)
Another way to ease the pain of arthritis is to make sure you don’t
let your dog become overweight. The heavier he is, the more stress
is put on his joints. Also, numerous supplements are available that
contain glucosamine and chondroitin — these nutrients lubricate
the joints causing less friction between the bones. You can find
them in chewable tables that your dog will eat up like treats.
Digestive disorders
Many old dogs get some sort of inflammatory disease of the gas-
trointestinal tract — a chronic irritation in his bowels, stomach,
and/or intestines. When your dog has this disease, he’ll vomit
and/or have diarrhea. Left untreated, he’ll lose weight and not be
able to eat normally.
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
216

The symptoms can be caused by food allergies or stress. Sometimes
emotional trauma can bring on the symptoms of intestinal disorders.
A diet change is often the first step. Your vet may suggest corticos-
teroids and other drugs if diet control isn’t enough. Talk to your
vet to see what she recommends.
Cancer
Cancer is a very common ailment in dogs — and it’s often fatal.
Because older dogs tend to be weakened with age, knowing
whether to put your dog through the difficult and expensive treat-
ments necessary to control the disease is tough.
Cancer of the organs is normally fatal. Skin cancer, however, can
often be treated with removal of the tumor and chemotherapy or
radiation applied to the affected area to kill any remaining cancer-
ous cells. Dogs tend to become ill when given the first chemother-
apy treatment, but they tend to tolerate subsequent treatments
fairly well.
You may want to investigate some alternative therapies.
Nutritional and herbal components are currently being tested in
dogs, and some are looking very promising. Talk with your vet
about all your options, and don’t hesitate to seek a second opinion
if you feel it’s necessary.
Dementia
If your dog has Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS, or dementia),
he might exhibit the following behaviors:
 Disorientation: Your dog might be confused, wander aim-
lessly, go to the wrong side of doors, or get stuck in corners or
behind furniture.
 Change in sleep patterns: Your dog will sleep more during the
day and less at night. He may tend to wander aimlessly
throughout the night.
 Housetraining regression: Your dog may go outside, forget why,
and then comes inside only to relieve himself on your floor.
 Avoiding family interaction: He may walk away from you
instead of wanting attention. He won’t want to play as he 
used to.
Chapter 15: The Special Needs of Senior Dogs 217

Other symptoms include obsessive/compulsive disorders, separa-
tion anxiety, fear biting, environmental phobias (such as fear of
thunder or other loud noises), and overall aggression. The aggres-
sion can be a variety of types, from fear biting to your dog being
more territorial or possessive.
A medication called L-Selegeline can be prescribed by your vet that
will help with the early symptoms of CDS. Most dogs show some
improvement within the first couple weeks, but there are some,
such as those in whom the CDS is quite advanced, who won’t show
any improvement at all. The medication has few side effects, but
some dogs have mild gastrointestinal upset when they’re on the
drug. Those dogs who improve with Anipryl must remain on it the
rest of their lives, or until the CDS progresses to the point where
the drug is no longer effective.
If you think your dog may have CDS, talk to your vet. She’ll be able
to diagnose the condition and tell you about your treatment options.
Depression
Dogs are emotional and form lifelong attachments. So when they
lose someone they dearly loved — whether a human companion 
or another animal — they can develop depression, just as humans
can. Depression can also be brought on because of a change of
scenery (maybe you moved to a new home) or because of weather
changes or health changes.
Regardless of the cause, the symptoms include
 Excessive barking
 Lethargy
 Anxiety or nervousness
 Obsessive behavior such as excessive grooming, self-
mutilation, or destructiveness
 Weight loss or gain
 Sulking
 Aggression
 Increased clinginess
When you recognize these behaviors as depression, there are
steps you can take to help your dog. Your vet can prescribe antide-
pressant medication. You can also improve the quality of your
dog’s life by increasing his activities and social life. Keep him busy!
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
218

Left too long, depression can turn into a life-threatening physical
condition.
Recognizing Behavior Problems
That Sometimes Come with Age
Along with the physical changes that come with age, your mixed
breed will also experience behavior and emotional changes. In fact,
you’re likely to see the behavior changes before the physical ones,
because most dogs won’t exhibit signs of physical weakness or
injury — doing so decreases their standing within a dog pack.
Physical problems can actually cause behavioral problems. The
onset of arthritis, for example, creates chronic pain, which in turn
makes your dog increasingly grouchy. If cancer is growing, your
dog may appear distracted, may not listen well, or may have the
tendency to strike out aggressively without reason.
Overall, your older dog will be less likely to respond to obedience
commands. If he’s in pain, it hurts to move. If he can’t hear you call
him to come, he won’t. If he doesn’t see your visual cues to sit, he
can’t. If he doesn’t remember what your cues mean, he doesn’t
know how to respond to them.
Dogs who once allowed young children to crawl all over them may
suddenly lash out or go hide when they get older. Some dogs who
once loved playing with other dogs no longer want to do so. Then
there’s the personal space issue — as dogs age, this becomes more
prominent. Their personal-space needs increase, because they
don’t want to be stepped on or jostled by a person or another dog.
There are reasons behind all this impatience and aggression. The
most common is pain from arthritis. Another reason is that your
old dog doesn’t see or hear well enough to be forewarned of
another presence. And, sadly, as dogs age, some develop dementia;
the neurons in their brain aren’t firing as efficiently as they once
did. All these can cause your dog to be impatient.
Pain causes bad moods. If someone were to touch a very painful
place on your body, you might yell at him. A dog may bark, snap, 
or even outright attack. All your dog knows is that someone who
touched him caused the more intense pain.
If your dog is experiencing dementia, and doesn’t understand his
world anymore, he’ll tend to be more touchy and aggressive. He
won’t remember his people or other animal pack members — they’ll
be strangers to him. If they get in his personal space, watch out!
Chapter 15: The Special Needs of Senior Dogs 219

If your dog is in pain or is suffering from Cognitive Dysfunction
Syndrome (CDS, or dementia — see the “Dementia” section, earlier in
this chapter), keep other animals and small children away from him.
Your vet can tell if your dog is suffering from dementia, and he’ll
also be able to gauge how much pain your dog is in from arthritis
or other health problems.
If your dog can’t hear or see something coming, how can he pre-
pared when it comes? Dogs rely heavily on their senses to under-
stand their world. If they can’t sense someone coming from behind
them, or are awakened suddenly, their first instinct is to lash out.
This can be especially dangerous in a home with youngsters,
because they don’t understand why their dog has suddenly
become less loving.
If your dog is losing his eyesight or hearing, you’ll need to change
how others interact with him. There are ways you and your kids
can inform your dog of your approach. For example, if your dog is
losing his hearing, clap your hands or stomp loudly on the floor
before you get close to him. Your dog still feels vibrations fairly
well, and this will alert him. If he can’t see well, try flashing the
lights on and off to grab his attention.
Saying Goodbye
As dogs age, they become debilitated by illness. You love your dog
and you hate to watch him suffer. Though most dogs try to hide
pain, you need to know what to look for beyond the obvious. Here
are some behaviors that might give you an indication of your dog’s
level of discomfort:
 Limping
 Obsessive scratching
 Licking an area
 Unusual mouth movements or excessive panting
 Frequently turning his head to look at his painful area
 Roaming in circles, pacing, or erratic movements
 Reluctance to get up or lie down, climb stairs, or get into 
the car
 Trembling or tension
 Being quieter or more clingy than usual
Part IV: Keeping Your Dog Healthy 
220

 Retreating or withdrawing from his family and animal 
companions
 Lack of appetite
If you’ve done all you can to try to alleviate his pain but he still dis-
plays the symptoms of extreme discomfort, you need to figure out
whether now is the time to let your dog go. How do you make that
decision? Ask yourself some important questions.
 Why is he still here? For your benefit? Will you be lonely with-
out him? If that’s the only reason you’re keeping your dog
alive, you’re putting your own needs ahead of your dog’s.
 What is his quality of life? Is the expensive veterinary treat-
ment you’re putting him through merely adding days or weeks
to his life? Or is it adding years — and if so, what kind of
years? Happy, pain-free ones, or ones of misery? If you’re only
adding a couple days or weeks, think about the quality of life
he’s leading. Is he comfortable? Is he happy? Is he wanting to
go outside and play, or hiding in a corner?
Overall, you need to consider whether your dog’s bad days out-
weigh his good ones. Try to be objective in your assessment and
be fair to your dog.
Although your vet can tell you there’s not much more you can do
to help your dog, only you can make the final decision. Your mixed
breed has been your loving companion for many years. You’ve
cared for him, shared wonderful moments together, and enjoyed
each others’ company. You don’t want him to suffer — you’ll be
suffering alongside him, and he won’t understand your sadness
and grief, which will only make him even more depressed.
I’ve had to make this impossible decision more times than I can
count. It never hurts less, and I’ll never forget the dogs I’ve helped
travel to the Rainbow Bridge. I still see them in my mind; in the
rearview mirror of my vehicle, smiling at me as they look forward
to adventure; the times we shared hiking, camping, and working.
Every one of them is still special to me and will forever live within
my soul.
You know and love your dog — and you’ll know when the time is
right to say goodbye.
Whether you’re thinking about putting your dog to sleep, or you’ve
recently done it, talking with friends and family helps. They can be
a huge support, helping you weigh your options and cope with your
grief. Your family and friends understand the loss of your dog better
than anyone else. They’ve seen the relationship you shared. They’ll
understand your stories and sit there holding you as you cry.
Chapter 15: The Special Needs of Senior Dogs 221

In addition to your friends and family, there are books you can turn
to, Web sites to go to. Here are just a few:
 Pet Loss and Children: Establishing a Healthy Foundation,
by Cheri Barton: If you have children, this book will guide you
in helping them, and yourself, through the loss of your beloved
dog. I like how it involves the children in the recovery process
through artistic expression and teaches how to recognize
when to say goodbye.
 Saying Good-Bye to the Pet You Love: A Complete Resource
to Help You Heal, by Lorri A. Greene and Jacquelyn
Landis: This book helps you overcome grief by writing out
your memories. It also mentions how taking a moment to
remember your pet through a special memorial is helpful.
This book also helps you recognize when the time is right to
say goodbye.
 Pet Loss: How to Prepare, Say Goodbye, Honor Your Pet’s
Life, by Lisa Shover: This book covers everything you need
to recognize when it’s time to say goodbye, how to go about
the process, how to help others as they grieve and how to
create a memorial for your dog.
 PetLoss.com (www.petloss.com): This is a great Web site for
counseling, support, and information regarding pet loss. This
group also has a regular Monday-night candle vigil paying trib-
ute and memorializing our lost loved ones.
 The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement (www.aplb.
org): This Web site is a great resource for anyone who needs
help in preparing for the loss of a pet or who needs support in
the grieving process. There are chat rooms and actual coun-
selors available to speak to. Sometimes all you need is an ear
to listen to your stories.
If you’re really having trouble coping with the loss of your pet, seek
the help of a professional grief counselor. You can talk to your
family physician to get a referral of someone in your area.
Don’t feel guilty about your decision to put your dog to sleep. You
kept him from pain and suffering, and that’s the most responsible
thing a pet owner can do.

Part V
Having Fun 
with Your Dog

In this part . . .
Your dog doesn’t need a pedigree to have fun or par-
ticipate in club activities. Many organizations are
open to mixed-breed dogs, and others are speciﬁcally 
for mixed-breed dogs.
In this part, I list some of the clubs and activities that you
and your mixed breed can participate in, including agility,
obedience, and Rally-O.
Mixed breed dogs are all over the airwaves. In movies, on
television programs, commercials, videos of all types and
advertisements, dogs grab attention and nothing does so
better than the unique attributes of a mixed-breed dog. If
you want your dog to be a media hound, you have to pre-
pare him for his time in the spotlight. In this part, I show
you how.
You and your mixed breed can do all kinds of activities
together. In this part, I open your eyes to the pleasures of
camping, hiking, boating, swimming, and horseback riding
with your dog at your side. If you like to travel, you can
include your dog — sharing your travels will make the
entire trip more enjoyable. In this part, I help you locate
pet-friendly places to stay and tell you what to bring
(besides your dog!).
Finally, if you have to travel without your dog, you have to
ﬁnd a safe place for him to stay (or someone to stay with
him). I ﬁll you in on your options.

Not Just for Purebreds:
Showing Off with Your 
Mixed Breed
In This Chapter
 Competing in performance trials
 Making your dog a star
Your dog doesn’t have to be pedigreed to compete in shows or
participate in fun activities. In this chapter, I introduce you to
the world of obedience shows, agility trials, and Rally-O. I also let
you know how you can get your mixed breed into commercials, TV,
and movies. If you and your dog are looking to take “play” to the
next level, this is the chapter for you!
Participating in a Mixed-Breed
Dog Club
Just because your dog didn’t come to you with a pedigree doesn’t
mean you can’t participate in any number of performance exhibi-
tions. Your dog’s performance has nothing to do with her appear-
ance and everything to do with the work you put into her.
Two of the largest clubs offering many show opportunities are the
Mixed Breed Dog Clubs of America (www.mbdca.org) and the
United Kennel Club (www.ukcdogs.com). The UKC is actually a
club for purebred dogs, including rare breeds, but it allows mixed-
breed dogs to compete in their performance activities. The clubs
will inform you of trial dates, but you need to work with a profes-
sional dog trainer or local dog training club to learn how to teach
your dog to perform in obedience trials.

Competing in obedience 
matches and dog shows
You and your dog can compete in obedience matches and/or trials at
dog shows. The difference between a match and a trial is that the
match is a practice run — a place where you can test your and your
dog’s skills prior to entering a trial and working toward an obedience
certificate. In a match, you can repeat an exercise or guide your dog
into performing correctly, and the judge will give you advice on how
to get your dog to achieve a better performance. In a trial, you
cannot do these things. You and your dog will be judged — period.
I recommend achieving good scores in a match before attempting
to perform at a trial. That way you can iron out the kinks and keep
the entire experience positive for your dog, because there’s no
need to stress over getting something wrong at the match.
There are three main levels in the obedience ring. Each level has
its own series of behaviors for your dog to perform. Here’s a list of
the classes, from easiest to hardest:
 Novice: In the Novice class, you and your dog will try to 
complete the following behaviors:
• Heeling on and off-leash
• Figure-8, on leash, around two people standing 8 feet
apart
• Stand and Stay with the judge touching the dog as you
remain 6 feet in front of the dog, with the dog off-leash
• Stay from 30 feet away
• Recall from 30 feet away
• Finish after the Recall
• One-minute Sit/Stay side by side with up to 12 other
dogs and handlers 30 feet away
• Three-minute down/stay side by side with up to 
12 others dogs and handlers 30 feet away
 Open: In the Open class, you and your dog will try to 
complete the following behaviors:
• Off-leash heeling pattern
• Off-leash figure-8 around two people standing 8 feet
apart
• Drop on Recall
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog 
226

• Retrieve on the flat
• Retrieve over a high jump (11⁄2 times the height of your
dog at the shoulders)
• Send over a broad jump (2 times the height of your dog
at the shoulders)
• Three-minute sit/stay side by side with other dogs and
the handler out of sight
• Five-minute down/stay side by side with other dogs and
the handler out of sight
 Utility: In the Utility class, you and your dog will try to 
complete the following behaviors:
• Off-leash heeling pattern using only visual cues, no voice
at all
• Stop and stand, using visual cues and move over 20 feet
away, faced away from dog
• Call dog to heel position while standing still
• Directed Retrieve: Retrieving a specific item (usually
white gloves) out of three identical items
• Scent discrimination: Retrieving both a leather and metal
article, bearing your scent, from other identical articles
• Directed Go Out: Leaving your side, running to the oppo-
site end of the ring, and turning and sitting until you
direct the next exercise
• Directed Jump: As the dog remains across the ring, you
direct the dog to one of two jumps — a bar jump or high
jump — repeat the Go Out again, and direct the dog to
the other jump (at the judges’ prompt)
Also, in a match there are non-regular classes that are both fun and
a stepping-stone between different levels:
 Sub-Novice: This is a starter class in which you can keep your
leash on your dog so that if the dog becomes distracted while
performing, she won’t be able to run off.
 Graduate Novice: This is a tweener class between Novice and
Open. It has exercises from both classes, preparing you for the
challenges you’d see in Open, while still allowing you to work
on perfecting some of the exercises done in the Novice class.
I’ve had lots of success with these non-regular classes — they gave
me and my dog the confidence to continue to the next level.
Chapter 16: Showing Off with Your Mixed Breed 227

There are three main obedience titles to strive for. To earn these
titles you must qualify with a score of 170 out of a possible 200 at
three different shows with three different judges. The titles are:
Novice class–Companion Dog (CD); Open class–Companion Dog
Excellent (CDX), and Utility Dog (UD). You can also work toward
championships (Obedience Trail Champion [OTCH]), high in trials,
and other awards though you can count on it taking years to reach
these goals. Of course, that’s years of fun (and hard work) for you
and your dog!
Competing in agility
Agility is quickly becoming the most popular canine event in the
United States and in some areas around the world. Dogs love per-
forming, and people love to watch them. Any dog of any size or
breed can compete, and some clubs allow mixed-breed dogs to
compete.
Agility was modeled on equestrian stadium jumping, with a variety
of obstacles that have both spectator appeal and the intention of
displaying the dog’s agile nature. In this sport, the dog must negoti-
ate a number of obstacles, off leash, within an allotted time frame.
The courses consist of jumps, tunnels, a pause table, weave poles,
an A-frame, a seesaw, a dog walk, and more — each challenging the
dog in different ways. You must be adept at directing the dog from
obstacle to obstacle without getting in the dog’s path.
Agility is a timed speed event, but the dog must also perform with
precision. She has to touch the contact obstacle (A-frame, seesaw,
or dog walk) at specific points both getting on and off, not knock
down the poles while jumping or weaving, and execute the obsta-
cles in the right order.
You can find out more about agility competitions by contacting the

Competing in Rally-O
Rally-O (short for Rally Obedience) was derived from obedience
trials, but it offers a more enjoyable means of competing with your
dog because you’re allowed to use praise as a means of reinforce-
ment while you guide your dog through the stations throughout
the course. It’s gaining in popularity by leaps and bounds!
As in agility, Rally-O is a timed event. It includes 12 to 20 stations
where you and your dog must perform different skills. There are
three levels to achieve in Rally-O:
 Novice: This level is on-leash with exercises that demonstrate
the dog’s understanding of basic commands: Sit, Stay, Down,
Come, and Heel.
 Advanced: This level is made up of a set of exercises where
the dog performs off-leash and includes at least one jump.
 Excellent: This level is a difficult off-leash course that
includes at least one jump and demonstrates more precise
skill coordination than in the Advanced level.
The course is different at each show, with the layout posted at the
ringside and handed out so you can learn the progression of the
exercises. Often, you can also walk the courses prior to the start of
class, because knowing where to turn and when to turn makes a
big difference in your overall performance.
Signs are posted for each station, which give instructions that you
and your dog must execute within 2 to 4 feet of the sign. After the
judge tells you and your dog to go forward, you complete the
course on your own without additional commands from the judge.
Although you can use voice guidance and your hands to give sig-
nals to your dog, you can’t use food or toys in the ring, and you
can’t place your hands on your dog or physically touch her.
This sport is great for dogs who are bored by the stop-and-go rou-
tines in the obedience ring. Many dog clubs now offer Rally-O at
their obedience trials, giving you more competitions to participate
in at a show.

Media Hound: Getting 
Your Dog on Camera
I’ve been providing animals for film and TV production work since
1983. It’s one of the most enjoyable activities that I do with ani-
mals. Every production is a new challenge and preparing the ani-
mals is loads of fun! The dog’s human guardians love the fact that
their dogs will be seen on television, in print, or in the movies.
Some of these dogs become quite popular and are used repeatedly
for many different types of work. I had one client tell me, “It’s like
he was a kid who spent the day in a candy shop. He came home
happy, tired, and full [of treats].”
Mixed-breed dogs are great for production work because each dog
is unique in appearance. Though the more unique dogs aren’t often
chosen for large parts in feature films (because it sometimes takes
more than one dog to do the part, so they need dogs who look
exactly alike), mixed-breed dogs are popular for advertisements,
TV shows, and TV commercials.
If you’re thinking of allowing your mixed breed to work in the pro-
duction world, your first step is to find an animal actors’ agent.
There are specific traits that agents look for, and you’ll want to see
if your dog has that special something that catches an agent’s eye.
You’ll also need to know how to prepare your dog for the work and
what to expect while she performs in front of the camera.
Even if an agent doesn’t think your dog is special, you know she is,
and that’s all your dog cares about.
Knowing what animal 
agents look for
Agents are looking, first and foremost, for well-trained dogs. Any
dog who can earn an obedience or agility title is always welcomed
by an animal actors’ agent. Your dog should be able to perform off-
leash with all kinds of distractions going on around her — because
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog 
230

a production can be a very distracting situation. A dog who can
perform specific tricks on command (such as speak, hold some-
thing in her mouth, fetch, or wave), as well as a dog who doesn’t
mind wearing clothing, is ideal.
Agents also look for dogs who are photogenic — and cute and pho-
togenic aren’t necessarily the same thing. For example, few black
dogs are chosen for production work because the camera can’t see
their facial expressions. Often, black-and-white, brown-and-white,
tan, merle, or other color combinations are what the producers are
looking for. Productions vary a lot, so dogs of all sizes are used at
one time or another.
Another item of extreme importance to an animal actors’ agent is
the dog’s overall appearance. A dog with a dry, flaky coat, dull
eyes, or low or high weight cannot perform well, so she won’t be
chosen. Owners of canine actors have to keep their dogs in the
peak of health and training at all times, because a healthy dog can
better tolerate the long performance and on-set hours. A health
dog shines inside and out.
If you want your dog to be an actor, you must allow the dog to be
available at all times. Rarely will you be allowed on the set, unless
you’re a professional trainer. This means that you must trust the
trainers who will work with your dog on-set — if you won’t trust
your dog in someone else’s hands, you won’t be happy with pro-
duction work.
Preparing for work
Other than practicing your dog’s obedience and special tricks, the
only way of knowing how to prepare for a job is to talk with your
dog’s agent regarding the availability of layouts. A storyboard is a
roughly drawn picture that helps the director and actors know
where to stand and where the cameras will be. It gives the trainer
an idea of the specific action required of the dog and from which
direction the camera will be angled.
If you aren’t a professional trainer, the agent will hire one to work
with your dog. The trainer will either pick up your dog at your
home, or make arrangements with you to bring her to the set.
You’ll be told whether you can remain with her at that time. During
any given production day, the dog is spending more time relaxing
than working. She’ll be getting lots of food rewards while working,
so she often isn’t fed much for her normal meals.
Chapter 16: Showing Off with Your Mixed Breed 231

If the dog is expected to retrieve something specific, you can prac-
tice this reaction ahead of time. If the dog is required to wear spe-
cific types of clothing, such as a hat and sunglasses, you can
practice this as well. As is often the case, however, the animal
actors’ agent is told that certain behaviors will be required, but
when the dog and trainer arrive on-set, the director has either
changed his mind or embellished on the original action. This
means that the dog must be well trained and easy to teach on the
spot.
Sometimes, much to the dismay of the animal actors’ agent and
trainer, the director requests the dog to “be a dog.” To a trainer,
this is a nightmare directive. Many people don’t understand that
they won’t get a specific action from a dog unless the dog is cued
to perform it. In these situations, there’s not much you can do to
prepare other than working on basic behaviors and tricks, hoping
that whatever will be expected is something your dog already
understands.
What to expect when your dog 
performs in front of the camera
In order for a dog to give her best performance, the trainer must
use positive reinforcement. This will make the entire experience
enjoyable for your dog. After every couple of commands, your dog
will be rewarded both verbally and with a treat or toy. What dog
wouldn’t love that?
A production is always a hurry-up-and-wait scenario. The dog is
requested to arrive at a call time, often hours prior to the time she
goes in front of the camera. So the dog gets to wait and wait and
wait. During that time, she needs to remain quiet so that she has
the energy to perform.
When she begins her performance, your dog will be in front of the
camera for anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes. As a new scene is set
up, she’ll wait another hour or two for a possible second scene
where she’ll be in front of the camera for another 20 to 30 minutes.
In all, there’s more waiting than working.

Chapter 17
Traveling with Charley
In This Chapter
 Preparing for your trip
 Driving or flying with your dog
 Leaving your dog at home
There was some genuine worry about my traveling alone, open
to attack, robbery, assault. It is well known that our roads are
dangerous. And here I admit I had senseless qualms. It is some
years since I have been alone, nameless, friendless, without any
of the safety one gets from family, friends, and accomplices.
There is no reality in the danger. It’s just a very lonely, helpless
feeling at first — a kind of desolate feeling. For this reason I took
one companion on my journey — an old French gentleman
poodle known as Charley.
—John Steinbeck, Travels with Charley in Search of America
O
ver the hills and through the woods, it’s a travelin’ we go! If
only it were so easy. Traveling with a dog requires careful
planning. You need to know what to pack, how to find hotels that
accept dogs, and special considerations for flying with your dog —
and in this chapter, I lay it all out for you. I also cover what to do if
you have to leave your dog at home.
Deciding Whether to Bring 
Your Dog with You
When you’re planning a trip and you own a dog, one of the first
things that crosses your mind is whether you can take your dog
with you. Although I’m sure you’d love to have your dog along for
the ride, you have to ask yourself a few key questions to decide
whether your mixed breed and this trip are a good fit:

 Will you have time to spend with your dog? If you’re going
on vacation, the answer will probably be yes — after all,
you’re on vacation to relax, right? But if you’re going on a
business trip, odds are your dog will end up having to spend a
lot of time in the hotel room by himself. He’ll be in a new
place, and being alone there won’t be as easy for him as it is
at your house. Unless you’ll be able to spend most of your
time with your dog, you’re better off leaving him at home.
 Is your pet in good condition to travel? If your dog is very
young or very old, a road trip might be strenuous for him —
he’ll have to relieve himself more often, and you’ll have to
make lots of stops. Young pups need to run — unless you’re
driving a monster SUV with a doggy playground in the back,
your pup will likely chew whatever is within reach (arm rests,
seat covers, head rests, suitcase handles). Old dogs may have
difficulty getting in and out of your vehicle.
A sick or injured dog should remain in a quiet environment,
not be jostled about in a vehicle or extremely stressed by a
ride in the cargo hold of an airplane.
 Is there a pet-friendly place to stay at your destination?
Most hotel chains don’t allow dogs in their establishments.
You’ll need to plan ahead and make reservations so that you
don’t end up driving around in the middle of the night search-
ing for a place to stay.
 If you’re visiting family and/or friends, are they okay with
the idea that your dog will be with you? One of the best
ways to make yourself unwelcome is to arrive at someone’s
house with your dog without first asking if they’re cool with it.
Believe me, after many years of having a relative come to my
house with dogs who urinated on my carpeting or showed
aggression to my animals, I can totally understand people
who’d rather not welcome other people’s pets into their
homes — and I love dogs!
Finding Pet-Friendly 
Places to Stay
Most hotels, motels, and bed-and-breakfasts don’t allow pets. And
in the hotels that do, room availability may be limited — they typi-
cally set aside certain rooms for people with pets. Even so, you can
find hotels and motels that accept dogs — you just need to spend
a little more time looking than you would otherwise.

234

AAA publishes a great book, Traveling With Your Pet, that’s
updated yearly, listing all the pet-friendly places to stay in the
United States. You don’t have to be a AAA member to obtain this
book at its Web site (www.aaa.com).
You can also find information on pet-friendly hotels at www.pets
welcome.com, www.dogfriendly.com, and www.bringfido.com.
Both sites allow you to see hotels in any city, state, or province
you’re visiting. (As of this printing, www.bringfido.com is limited
to just the United States, but the other two offer information on
hotels in Canada as well.)
Packing for Your Trip
When you’re traveling on your own, you may jot down a list of
things you need to remember to pack. Well, you need to do the
same for your dog when you’re bringing him along. The good news:
I’ve done much of the legwork for you. Here’s a list of items to
bring on your trip:
 Food and water dishes: The collapsible type are great when
space is tight. Otherwise, lightweight plastic dishes work well.
 A bottle of water from home: If the trip is short, such as a
day or two, a gallon of water should do. If longer, bring
enough water for during the traveling and a bit for arrival to
gently wean your dog onto whatever water is available at your
destination. Water varies from location to location — a
sudden change can upset your dog’s stomach.
 Food: Place kibble in an airtight container to maintain fresh-
ness. If you’re bringing canned food, be sure to bring a can
opener if you’ll need one. Be sure to bring enough food for the
entire trip.
 Your dog’s bed: If you don’t want to bring a bulky bed, bring
along a mat. You can find zippered mat beds that double as
carrying cases for dog supplies. I usually use it for doggy 
toys, treats, leashes, and packaged food when I travel with 
my dogs.
 Leash and collar with identification tags: If your dog pulls on
the leash when you walk him, bring a training device, such as
a head halter or Easy Walk harness.
 Treats and toys: Interactive toys — such as treat-stuffed toys
or those that are edible — are best. I’ve found that a plain, old
shank bone, stuffed with ground up food is great. It’s inexpen-
sive and reusable.
Chapter 17: Traveling with Charley 235

 Grooming supplies
 Medications and supplements
 Bags for picking up droppings
 Your dog’s health records: Regardless of where you travel or
for how long, have a copy of your mixed breed’s vaccination
record and rabies certificate. This is especially important
when crossing state lines or traveling in a foreign country.
If you’re going to the beach, be sure to bring some means of shad-
ing your dog from the sun, such as a beach umbrella or a tent; an
extra towel or two for your dog; and a keep-cool mat. These are
special mats that can be soaked in cold water and will remain cool
for hours — a great way to help your furry friend control his body
temperature when it’s very hot outside. You can carry it in a large
cooler, along with your water bottles and soda.
If you’re heading to the mountains, bring along a mobile first-aid kit
(see Chapter 14). With exposure to wild animals and uneven ter-
rain, your dog could get injured, and you want to be prepared.
Bring along some insect repellent as well, such as Avon’s Skin-So-
Soft — it may help prevent topical parasites on your dog.
Keep the following contact info handy while you travel:
 American Animal Hospital Association (phone: 303-986-2800;
Web: www.healthypet.com): Contact the association if you
need to find a vet while you’re on the road.
 Dogpark.com: This Web site can help you find a place to exer-
cise your dog while you’re on the road.
Traveling by Car
Traveling by car can be a fun and easy way to get to places with
your mixed breed in tow. To make sure your trip is a fun one for
you and your dog, be sure to acclimate your dog to car travel 
gradually. Begin with short trips to fun places — this makes the
experience more rewarding.
An important part of traveling with your dog is keeping him safe on
the trip, and that means containing him in some way so that he
doesn’t have free run of the car. If he can run all over the car, he
may interfere with your ability to see or steer, or if you get in an
accident or you have to brake suddenly, he could go flying.
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog 
236

You can contain your dog in a comfortable crate, strap him into a
special body harness with a seat belt attachment, or let him hang
out in a flat rear cargo area with a divider. The containment
method you use depends largely on your dog’s size and tempera-
ment. Here’s the lowdown on each:
 Crate: The crate is best for anxious dogs or those who tend 
to chew or whine or bark in the car. Whether your dog is anx-
ious or not, a crate is the safest place for him to be in your car.
I recommend a metal crate because it’s sturdy but provides
ample air flow and gives your dog a view of everyone in the car
and everything outside the windows. You can drape a reflect-
ing blanket over it to keep the interior cooler on hot days.
Never keep your dog in a hot car on a hot day with the win-
dows closed or left open only a crack. Your dog will die of
heat stroke and suffocation in an agonizing, cruel manner.
 Seat restraints: Many brands of dog seat restraints are avail-
able. Most come in the form of an upper-body harness with a
clip that attaches either to the belt or to the actual seat belt
insert clip. For a medium to large dog, use the type that clips
directly into the seat belt clip insert. For smaller dogs, I rec-
ommend a booster seat with the seat belt attachment to a
body harness. The booster seat lets your small dog look at 
the scenery while in a comfortable cushioned bed.
 The rear cargo area: If you have a station wagon or SUV, you
can place your medium to large mixed breed in the back cargo
area, with a metal divider keeping him from getting into the
front seats. It’s similar to a crate, though often larger. Your
dog can see the passing scenery and remain secure behind
the metal vehicle barrier. You will have to put up with nose
smudges on the glass, though — a small price to pay from
your dog’s point of view!
Don’t leave your dog loose in the cargo area if he’s destruc-
tive, has traveling anxiety of any sort, or likes to bark at
everyone he sees while you drive. You’ll be more distracted
worrying about what he’s doing back there than keeping your
mind on the road. Also, don’t put a small dog in the rear cargo
area — he could go flying if you stop suddenly.
Flying with Your Dog
Some dog owners never let their dogs travel by plane; others have
never had any problems and do it all the time. The main thing to
consider: Unless your dog can fit under an airline seat, he’ll have to
Chapter 17: Traveling with Charley 237

ride in the checked baggage area or the cargo hold. Though the
cargo hold is temperature-controlled while in flight (not while on
the ground) and have an air-exchange system, it will still be more
stressful for your mixed breed than remaining with you in the
cabin.
Unless your dog can fit in his carrier under the seat, only certified
service animals can remain in the cabin with their human 
companions.
If your dog has to remain in his air carrier for more than six hours
straight, he may have trouble not being able to relieve himself.
Imagine yourself having to do that — especially when stressed. It’s
tough. And, if you have flight layovers or you have multiple flights,
you probably won’t be able to visit with your dog. The airlines 
generally have people who check on your dog for you.
Some types of dogs should not travel by air — period. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) specifies that dogs under 8
weeks of age can’t fly at all. If the dog is ill, injured, pregnant, or
very old, they recommend that he doesn’t travel by air. Also, dogs
with very short noses such as Pugs and Boxers, as well as long-
nosed dogs such as Collies, are prone to respiratory difficulties,
and the UDSA suggests they only travel by air if they can do so in
the passenger cabin. Some airlines won’t accept short-nosed
breeds at all if the temperature exceeds 70°F anywhere during the
routing (between the terminals and airplane).
What to do before you leave
When you’re flying with a dog, you’ll need to make some prepara-
tions beyond the more-basic road-trip ones. In the following 
sections, I walk you through what you need to do.
Checking out the airlines’ requirements
The first thing you need to do when considering an air trip with
your dog is to determine the airline’s regulations. Airlines change
their regulations frequently, so check with your favorite airlines
before buying your ticket.
Buying an airline-approved crate
The crate you use for your dog in your house probably isn’t an air-
line-approved crate, so the first thing to do when you start thinking
about flying with your dog is to get one. You’ll want a crate that’s
not only comfortable for your dog but that’ll keep him safe
throughout the flight.
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog 
238

The crate should have a hard shell, so that if something acciden-
tally falls on it, your pet will be protected. If the crate (and your
dog) are small enough to carry, it should have a strong handle. If
your dog is too large to carry, make sure you can either push the
crate on wheels or lift it onto a wheeled cart.
The crate should have plenty of ventilation and a leak-proof floor.
Place an absorbent bed on the floor so that your mixed breed 
will be comfortable during the flight. The crate door should open
easily, but also be secure enough to prevent your dog from escape
or from it accidentally opening when it’s jostled.
If you’re able to bring your small dog into the passenger cabin, his
crate must be able to fit under the seat in front of you, and the dog
must stay within his crate. The under-seat space is approximately
23 by 13 by 9 inches. Beyond being able to fit in this space, there
aren’t any other restrictions on the kind of crate you use. Keep in
mind, however, that your pet won’t be allowed out of his crate
during the trip, so he must be contained in a comfortable carrier
with plenty of ventilation.
If you’re traveling with more than one mixed breed, you can only
have one per crate if either dog weighs more than 20 pounds.
Making sure your dog has proper identification 
and health certificates
Take your dog to your vet within ten days prior to your flight, have
a complete physical examination, and request a copy of his vacci-
nation record, rabies certificate, and a health certificate. If your
mixed breed is traveling in the cargo hold, place his identification
information (and yours) on the crate as well as any care instruc-
tions. When there are layovers or if you’re traveling internationally,
airline employees will be caring for your dog and should be given
appropriate instructions.
Caring for your dog before 
and after the flight
Traveling by air can be stressful for both you and your mixed
breed. So here are some tips for making it better for both of you:
 Before the day of your flight, acclimate your dog to his air
crate. Make sure he likes it before you leave. (You can get
your dog used to his crate by leaving it open at home and
using it as his bed and eating area.)
Chapter 17: Traveling with Charley 239

 Don’t check in your dog until the very last minute. Until
then, allow him to be out and about with you, moving around
and acclimating to the airport congestion and commotion.
Stay upbeat and give him plenty of rewards.
 Make sure his water and food bowls are securely fastened
to the side of the crate so they don’t spill in flight.
 Place a couple of his favorite toys in the crate, as well as
some interactive chewies. Just make sure that you don’t
leave him with anything he might choke on, such as rawhide.
 After the flight, remove your dog from his travel crate (on a
leash) as soon as you reach a safe area where he can stretch
his legs and go potty. Because he likely didn’t do his business
while traveling, and was very stressed during the trip, he’ll 
be hopping from leg to leg by the time you arrive at your 
destination.
 After he’s emptied his bladder and bowels, offer him fresh
water and food, and let him move around, play with some
toys, and cuddle with you before you leave the airport.
Leaving Your Dog Behind
You can’t always take your mixed-breed dog with you when you
travel. In this section, I cover your two main options for leaving
your mixed breed behind.
Finding an in-home sitter
When you’re looking for a reputable pet sitter, your best option is
to ask your family and friends for referrals. If you can’t find any
good recommendations that way, try checking with either Pet
Sitters International (phone: 336-983-9222; Web: www.petsit.com)
or the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters (phone:
856-439-0324; Web: www.petsitters.org).
Here’s a list of questions to ask a potential pet sitter:
 Are you insured for commercial liability and bonded? A
sitter who is bonded and insured is serious about her services.
 What do your services include? Before you interview the
potential pet sitter, make a list of all the things you’d want the
pet sitter to do with your dog (walk him, hang out with him,
play with him), and go down the list to be sure she’ll do 
everything.
Part V: Having Fun with Your Dog 
240

 What does the sitter require of you? Does the sitter require
access to current veterinary information about your dog?
(This is important in case of an emergency — she’ll have to
take your dog to a veterinarian and must have appropriate
documentation.) Does she ask for a letter from you stating
that she represents you in your absence?
 What kind of animals does the sitter normally work with? If
the pet sitter normally only watches cats and fish, or if she’s
used to small dogs and you have a 100-pound mutt, it might
not be a good fit.
 How will the pet sitter handle emergencies? What if the pet
sitter gets in an accident and can’t come to watch your dog?
Does she have a backup plan for herself? And what if some-
thing happens to your dog while you’re away? Will she take
your dog to your vet, or will she go someplace else? Make
sure you’re comfortable with the answers.
 Does the sitter fully understand your mixed-breed dogs’
needs? Always fully explain to the sitter your dogs’ physical
needs and overall behavior patterns. What times does he nor-
mally eat, sleep, play, and exercise? How does he behave
while being walked? How much training has he had? What are
his training commands? Explain the feeding process to the
sitter — what your mixed-breed dog is fed, how much, where
he eats, how he eats.
 How much time will the pet sitter spend with your dog?
Many pet sitters charge by the 15-minute increment of time
and allow you to choose how long you want them to stay.
Knowing what to look for in a kennel
As with a pet sitter, the best place to find a kennel is through a
referral from someone you trust. If you can’t get any recommenda-
tions, check with the American Boarding Kennels Association
(phone: 719-667-1600; Web: www.abka.com).
Depending on where you live, you can find kennels that range from
the most basic (the dogs stay in a fenced-in area with a concrete
floor, and minimal access to the outdoors) to the most posh (dogs
have their own human-size beds — just like a hotel). Some kennels
offer many different levels of accommodations and care.
Before making a reservation, visit the kennel and take a tour. Check
for cleanliness, employee knowledge, and the comfort of the ani-
mals (if they’re making a lot of noise, pacing, or sitting in a dark
corner, this may not be a good sign). Find out about the opportuni-
ties for your dog to receive attention, exercise, and grooming.
Chapter 17: Traveling with Charley 241

Here’s a list of questions to ask any boarding kennel:
 What’s included in the fee? Just feeding and cleaning, or also
exercise and attention?
 What vaccinations are required? If the kennel requires no
vaccinations, stay away! The kennel should require rabies,
parvo, distemper, and other contagious-disease vaccinations,
including bordetella (kennel cough).
 How will emergencies be handled? Is there a vet on call? 
Will your dog be taken to the vet he’s used to seeing?
 Where will your dog be housed? A cage, run, or suite?
What’s in the room with him? His own toys and bed from
home?
 How often are the dogs fed and interacted with?
 How often are the dogs’ sleep and other areas cleaned?
When you drop your dog off at the kennel, leave your contact infor-
mation along with a copy of your dog’s health records, in case of
emergencies. Also, let the staff know about his feeding routines,
what he eats, how he eats, the type of exercise he prefers, the type
of people he likes to interact with, and any commands he may
know, as well as any psychological quirks, medical conditions,
medication, or supplements.
Bring your dog’s regular food with him to the kennel so that he
isn’t fed something that doesn’t agree with his digestive system.
Prepackage each meal and label it, so that there aren’t any skipped
supplements.

The Part of Tens

In this part ... 
T
he Part of Tens is a part of every For Dummies book,
and this one is no different! If you’re in a hurry, and
you want a whole lot of bang for your buck, this is the part
for you. Here you ﬁnd ten reasons to spay or neuter your
dog, and ten events you and your mixed breed can enjoy
together.

Chapter 18
Ten Reasons to Spay 
or Neuter Your Dog
In This Chapter
 Finding low-cost ways to spay or neuter your dog
 Understanding how spaying or neutering your pet can help the pet popula-
tion
 Assessing the health risks of not spaying or neutering your dog
W
hen you start thinking about spaying or neutering your dog,
the first questions you should ask yourself are: Why did
you get your mixed-breed dog? Because you wanted a companion,
or because you specifically wanted to breed other animals? If you
wanted a companion (the reason most people get dogs), you
should sterilize your dog to improve the quality of your life and
your dog’s.
Dog breeding is not for everyone. Done correctly it is costly, time-
consuming, and often heart-wrenching. Though many people deal
with the aftermath of breeding accidents, or breed their dogs with-
out thinking about the dogs’ or puppies’ welfare, you can be cer-
tain that a large percentage of pregnant female dogs and their
puppies wind up either at animal shelters or suffer dreadful 
consequences.
Whether you have a designer dog that costs thousands, or a 
Heinz 57 you adopted, there is no reason for breeding your dog
and many reasons not to. In this chapter, I give you ten of the 
many reasons why you should spay or neuter your pet.

It Doesn’t Cost Much — 
and It May Be Free!
If you adopted your mixed-breed dog from a shelter, humane society,
or rescue organization, you’ll likely be able to get a huge discount
when it’s time to sterilize your dog. Just ask the people you got your
dog from. The discounts can be anywhere from 10 to 60 percent!
Some veterinarians do spay and neutering clinics — often free to
humane and rescue organizations. If you’ve adopted from those
organizations, you may be able to get the service without charge.
Information on free or low-charge spaying/neutering is often
posted on bulletin boards at the volunteer veterinarians’ hospitals;
animal shelters are also aware of the locations and dates of the
clinics, so check with them if you’re unsure.
Many rescue groups already have sterilized their dogs before
allowing them to be adopted, while humane societies require you
to do it before they’ll allow the dog to go home with you.
Some low-cost spay-and-neuter clinics are able to offer this service
because they minimize the use of anesthetic monitoring, the use of
intravenous fluids, and post-operative pain control. If you can afford
this procedure through your normal vet, go that route instead —
you’ll decrease the risks and pain associated with surgery.
If you’re choosing between getting your dog spayed/neutered at a
low-cost clinic, and not spaying/neutering at all, always opt for
spaying/neutering.
Breeding Is Time-Consuming 
and Expensive
If you’re the owner of a female dog who got loose at the wrong time
and came home pregnant, you’ve got a lot of expense ahead of you.
Besides the time-consuming puppy and mommy care, you’ll have
to take the pups to the vet for worming and the first set of vaccina-
tions when they’re 5 weeks old, and again at 7 weeks. The costs of
these vaccinations can range anywhere from $25 to $50 per puppy
per visit. Did your dog have seven puppies? Do the math.
What if your dog becomes ill and can’t feed her puppies? You’ll
have to hand-feed each one (more cost for formula and bottles for
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
246

seven puppies for four weeks — ka-ching!) every two to four hours,
24 hours a day. That’s more than a full-time job!
When the puppies reach 3 weeks of age, the mommy dog begins to
wean them. She won’t want to stick around and feed or clean them.
Now it’s up to you to make sure she does her time with them when
she’d really rather not. You’ll have to force her to do her job.
When the pups reach 4 weeks of age, it’s completely up to you as
the puppies are weaned. You’ll have to feed them three times a day
(more money for food), and clean up after them. Generally, a
puppy pen needs cleaning three times a day, or the puppies are
covered in a smelly mess.
Then there’s the noise level. When they’re hungry, puppies cry.
When they play, they bark at each other. And they’re not on your
sleeping schedule — you’re on their schedule, which means 
sometime around 2 or 3 in the morning, it’s playtime!
Having puppies isn’t all fun and games. Sure they’re cute, and
puppy breath can’t be beat, but they’re loads of work and cost a
lot! Spaying your female dog will save you a lot of time and money.
You Reduce Your Dog’s 
Risk of Cancer
The older your dog becomes, the higher the risk that she’ll
develop any number of cancers.
Male dogs are prone to testicular and prostate infection and cancer,
while female dogs can get mammarian, ovarian, uterine, and cervi-
cal cancer. Not caught in time, these diseases are fatal. Even if
caught in the early stages, cancer is extremely expensive to treat.
You’ll need to weigh the difference between the cost of sterilization
($75 to $150) and the cost of treating cancer (upwards of $2,000 for
surgery, chemo, and/or radiation treatments). Plus, cancer causes
all kinds of physical and psychological stress for you and your dog.
Cancer isn’t the only health risk for an unsterilized pet. Unsterilized
dogs are more prone to developing kidney and bladder infections.
Female dogs are prone to uterine and pelvic infections, as well as
frequent vaginitis.
Overall, the cost is too high — both materially and psychologically —
not to spay or neuter your dog.
Chapter 18: Ten Reasons to Spay or Neuter Your Dog 247

You Help Control the Number of
Unwanted Dogs in the World
In the United States, a dog is euthanized every 4 seconds of every
day. That’s millions of dogs killed each year because people
weren’t responsible pet owners.
The average family of four would have to own eight dogs each in
order for every dog in the United States to have a home. Are you
willing to have eight dogs? Is your neighbor? How would that work
in a high-rise apartment building in the city?
The rampant spread of disease is another reason that dogs are
being euthanized at an alarming rate. The more feral dogs there
are, without the benefit of vaccinations, the faster they will spread
diseases such as rabies, parvovirus, distemper, and other highly
contagious diseases, some of which are transferable to humans.
Also, homeless dogs can be dangerous to local wildlife and cats, as
well as causing vehicular accidents. Some may even harm children.
There are many known cases of wandering dog packs actually
killing children and the elderly.
Your dog needs you to be a responsible guardian.
Your Dog Won’t Be as Likely 
to Stray from Home
Female dogs in season seek male dogs. It’s a hard-wired instinct.
You open your front door, and out she goes — and she won’t
return for days, if at all. If she returns home, you’ll have a pregnant
dog to deal with.
Unneutered male dogs can smell a female dog in season from more
than a mile away. They perform feats of spectacular escapism to
reach that female. Plus, they become assertive and temperamental
if they aren’t allowed to reach the source of the scent. Do you want
to lose your dog with the high probability of never seeing him
again? Or knowing that he can become injured by fighting with
other dogs over a female in season, or being hit by a car and dying
on the side of the road because he had to get to that female dog
across the busy highway? Is it really that important to keep your
dog intact when the risks of permanently losing him are that high?
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
248

Your Dog Will Be on 
Her Best Behavior
Neutering or spaying does not change who your dog is, but it will
enhance her behavior in a more positive way, making your relation-
ship with her more harmonious. When your female dog is in heat
or your male dog smells a female in heat, your mixed breed won’t
be the baby or best friend you’ve known.
Your Dog Will Be Easier 
to Housetrain
Neutered male dogs are less likely to spray the furniture in your
home or otherwise mark territory indoors. They’re more accepting
of the fact that inside the home is your territory. When an intact
male dog detects a female dog in heat, he’ll likely break all the
housetraining rules and behave as though he’d never learned
them. The mess and stench will be tremendous. You’ll be tempted
to make your dog live outdoors instead of with you — and that
means he’ll no longer be a family member.
A neutered/spayed dog will be more likely to acquiesce to house-
training due to not having the desire to be in charge or behave in
an instinctual manner. Your dog can’t control her mood swings 
and needs.
Another important reason is the mess involved with a female dog
in heat. She will be leaking blood for ten days during the first
trimester of her heat. It’s messy, smelly, and can stain your floor-
ing, furniture, and bedding. Who wants to deal with that?
Reproduction Can Be Risky
Many things can go wrong with whelping puppies. There can be
health and delivery risks for the mother. If she has a dead puppy in
her womb, she can become seriously ill as the puppy decomposes
or spreads any disease that might have killed the pup to the other
puppies and to the mother. If one of the puppies doesn’t exit the
womb properly, causing the mother dog physical distress, she’ll
have to undergo a cesarean section to deliver the puppies. This
will be very costly to you and physically stressful to her.
Chapter 18: Ten Reasons to Spay or Neuter Your Dog 249

Some mother dogs don’t want to be mothers. They won’t clean up
after their pups or feed them. Guess who will have to take over?
Yep, that’s right: you! Will you be willing to do this when she won’t?
Your Dog Will Be a 
Better Watchdog
A neutered dog will want to protect his home territory instead of
wanting to increase the size of his territory. Intact male dogs tend
to mark every object they can when going for walks through the
neighborhood. They want to increase the size of their territory and
do so by leaving this “calling card.” A neutered dog will be less
likely to want to stop at every tree, fence post, and mailbox to
leave his mark. He won’t care about increasing his territory. He’s
quite happy with the one he has at home.
A dog who loves his home will tend to protect it better. You’ll be
alerted to the presence of strangers who enter the area instead of
wondering why you never heard your dog bark when someone
arrived because the dog was down the block investigating the
source of an interesting smell.
So if you spend a lot of time home alone, keeping your dog home,
too, will be very beneficial. He will want to stay home if he’s not
driven to roam by raging hormones.
Your Dog Isn’t You
You love your mixed breed very much. You may even “identify”
with her as a part of yourself — an extension or appendage. You
think that you would hate to be unable to reproduce. It’s the driv-
ing force of nature, of all living things.
You have to be realistic. Your dog is a dog, not a person, and not
you in particular. You can prove your love and devotion to your
dog by neutering or spaying, because you’ll be improving your
dog’s quality of life as well as your dog’s longevity.

Ten Fun Activities You 
and Your Mixed Breed 
Can Enjoy Together
In This Chapter
 Showing off your mixed-breed dog
 Playing games
 Becoming a good citizen
 Having fun outdoors
 Helping others
T
here are loads of fun activities you can do with your mixed-
breed dog — none of which require a pedigree! From competi-
tion to helping others, you can participate in many activities where
both of you would have fun.
The more events you work for, and the more titles you earn with
your dog, the better you and he work together. Never buy into the
idea that your dog has accomplished all he can — there is always
more to learn! You can also be certain that the more you teach him,
the happier he’ll be, because you’re stimulating his brain and exer-
cising his body.
If you want to help others, you can enlist your mixed breed as a
helper. The first step is to prove that he’s a good citizen. The next 
is to train him and prepare yourself as a therapy team going to
schools, hospitals, and convalescent homes visiting those who
can’t have pets. The presence of an animal has great healing power.
Just as your mixed breed keeps your heart whole, merely touching
his coat or receiving a wet kiss from his lips has great benefits for
another person. Your dog will love traveling to places with you, and
the attention from everyone is a huge boost to his ego.

The things you can do and the places you can go together are end-
less. Take the time to peruse the possibilities in the great world of
mixed-breed dogs!
Competing with Your Dog 
at the Classic K-9 Show
The North American Dog Racing Association’s Classic K-9 Show
(www.classick9.com) is open to dogs of all breeds or mixed com-
binations. It’s a great venue to participate in many types of canine
sports to earn titles and prizes. These include high jumping and
timed agility.
The Web site is filled with information on how to join the organiza-
tion as well as about competing. You can find an event schedule, so
you can check out a show in your area (or at least close). If you see
one in your area, go watch! Being a spectator is almost as fun as
competing — plus, it’ll give you a sense of whether this is an activ-
ity you and your dog would enjoy!
Participating in United 
Kennel Club Events
The United Kennel Club (www.ukcdogs.com) is the largest all-breed
performance registry in the world. It registers dogs from across the
United States and in 25 other countries. More than 60 percent of its
licensed events are tests of natural abilities such as hunting, train-
ing, and instinct. They emphasize the dog’s performance not
appearance.
The United Kennel Club is one of the few purebred dog clubs that
also allows mixed-breed dogs to compete. The club members
believe that this will improve the health and well-being of all dogs.
The UKC sanctions obedience trials, agility, dog sport, weight
pulling, and terrier races. All mixed-breed dogs are welcome to
compete in these performance classes. They are offered through-
out the year all over North America.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
252

Having Fun at Mixed Breed Dog
Clubs of America Events
The Mixed Breed Dog Clubs of America (MBDCA; www.mbdca.org) 
is a registry for mixed breeds. It provides the same opportunities 
for competitions that the American Kennel Club does for purebred
dogs. The MBDCA doesn’t have the same conformation-type compe-
tition of the AKC (which judges dogs according to a breed standard,
that includes all kinds of mostly appearance-related attributes). But
the MBDCA does have performance events where you can earn simi-
lar titles to those put on AKC dogs, as well as a conformation compe-
tition where the standard is toward general soundness as well as a
good temperament and manners (as opposed to appearance).
In obedience, your dog can earn titles in Novice (on- and off-leash
obedience routines), Open (off-leash obedience routines), and
Utility (advanced off-leash obedience routines), as well as the title
of Obedience Trial Champion. The title initials are the same as the
AKC initials, only with the letters MB in front of them, denoting
that the dog is a mixed breed. For example, the title for Mixed
Breed Companion Dog is MB-CD; for Mixed Breed Companion Dog
Excellent, MB-CDX; for Mixed Breed Utility Dog, MB-UD; and for
Mixed Breed Utility Dog Excellent, MB-UDX.
Training Your Dog to Dive
I’ll never forget watching my first dock diving competition. I loved
not only seeing those dogs racing down a dock and diving, but
observing how much fun they and their handlers were having.
Dock diving is open to all dogs of any breed or mix. This event has
become so popular that it’s featured on ESPN, called the Big Air
Games. Because of the sport’s quick rise in popularity, the organi-
zation Dock Dogs was formed to oversee all the smaller organiza-
tions dedicated to this sport. Its Web site (www.dockdogs.com)
features information on how to get started and a list of events
throughout the country. Another great site for information on this
sport is Sport Mutt (www.sportmutt.com).
In order to enjoy dock diving, you just need to have access to
water with either a diving board or dock. Your dog must love the
water. Dogs who have a high desire to retrieve are also naturals for
this sport, because they’ll want to chase down the ball as it soars
over the water.
Chapter 19:Ten Fun Activities 253

Currently, there aren’t any training clubs where you can go to learn
how to teach your dog to dock dive. But the sites mentioned ear-
lier do explain how to train your dog and where to go for dock
diving events.
Joining the Fun at the Australian
Shepherd Club of America
Formed in 1957 to promote the Australian Shepherd Dog breed, it
has opened its doors to allowing mixed-breed dogs to compete in
ASCA-sanctioned shows and earn titles as well.
Before Australian Shepherds were recently accepted as a purebred
by the American Kennel Club, they were only allowed to compete
in open matches or at ASCA-sanctioned shows. Due to these
restrictions, the group decided to allow other dogs not recognized
by the AKC to also compete at its shows.
ASCA holds obedience and other performance events around 
the country. Visit the Web site (www.asca.org) to find an event
near you.
Camping and Hiking: Finding 
Fun Outdoor Activities
What’s better than exploring and enjoying the great outdoors with
your mixed breed? At Dog Play (www.dogplay.com), you can find a
useful list of camps and outdoor activities for dog enthusiasts.
These camps offer accommodations, meals, scheduled activities
and classes, a chance for dogs to play with other dogs, and oppor-
tunities for you to hike, bike, canoe, and explore. Whether you go
with a special someone or by yourself, you’ll meet many other dog
enthusiasts who share your passion for mixed breeds.
Helping Your Dog Become 
a Good Citizen
The Canine Good Citizen (www.akc.org/events/cgc/index.cfm)
is a great certificate to work toward with your dog. It proves your
dog’s temperament and control as well as social skills. Since its
inception, it has become a popular goal for many dog owners.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
254

There are even communities that require all dogs living within that
community to be CGC-certified!
Though the AKC is a club for purebred dogs, it offers the CGC test
to mixed breeds as well. You can often find CGC tests listed in the
newspaper, or online at www.akc.org, where there are listings for
each state.
To earn a CGC title, the dog must pass ten tests of social skill, 
temperament, and obedience. These tests include
 Accepting a friendly stranger
 Sitting politely for petting
 Being examined for overall health and well-being
 Going out for a walk (walking on a leash)
 Walking through a crowd
 Performing a Sit and Down on command, as well as staying for
a short period of time
 Coming when called
 Observing your dog’s reaction to new objects and the 
presence of strangers
 Observing your dog’s reaction to the presence of other dogs
 Observing how your dog reacts when left alone for a short
period of time
Help Your Dog Help Other People
If you’re interested in training your dog to be a therapy dog (who
goes to hospitals and convalescent centers to bring a smile to
people’s faces), the Delta Society (www.deltasociety.org) is 
the place to start. You can find out where to take a course in 
your area. (Courses are offered throughout the United States and
internationally.)
Courses help you select and prepare animals for visits to nursing
homes, schools, hospitals, and convalescent centers. They also
cover how to recognize stress in your dog and provide information
regarding animal health and safety. The Delta Society course also
teaches you about the special needs of specific client groups, such
as children, the elderly, or the physically challenged. This course
also covers the legal codes related to the facilities you’ll be visiting
with your dog. Prior to passing its stringent testing, your dog must
be well trained.
Chapter 19:Ten Fun Activities 255

When your mixed breed is certified, you and your dog can visit
hospitals, nursing homes, and schools bringing joy and healing to
everyone. You’ll need to make arrangements with each organiza-
tion regarding appropriate scheduled visiting times and discuss
the individuals you’ll be working with. The Delta Society stresses
preparedness and patient confidentiality, so this preparation will
help you perform a better service.
Dancing with Your Mixed Breed
Yes, you can actually dance with your dog. This sport is known as
Canine Freestyle, because dancing with dogs is not based on a spe-
cific pattern, but rather on your ability to choreograph your move-
ments and your dog’s movements in tandem, to music, incorporating
obedience, natural canine movement, and fancy trick behaviors.
Several Freestyle clubs and organizations hold events all over the
United States and some throughout the world. The two largest clubs
are the Canine Freestyle Federation (www.canine-freestyle.
org) and The World Canine Freestyle Organization (www.world
caninefreestyle.org). It is now offered by the AKC as a point-
earning event, and mixed breeds are allowed to compete with 
prior approval of the AKC.
Flying High with Flyball
Flyball is a relay race. At the starting signal the dogs are sent over
a series of four jumps to a box where they must trigger the release
of a ball or beanbag, take hold of it, and race back to their handlers
over the four jumps, carrying the ball or beanbag all the way. The
first team of four dogs and handlers to complete the course wins
the race. Points are assigned according to the dogs’ speed.
There’s a reason this sport is paired with cheering: It’s fun for your
dog, fun for you and your team, and fun to watch. The sport is
open to all dogs — purebred and mixed breed alike.
The North American Flyball Association (www.flyball.org) is the
governing body for this sport. At www.flyballdogs.com, you can
get information about how the game is run, what titles are avail-
able, where to find tournaments, and how to train.

Mixed-breed dogs are every bit as adorable as their purebred counterparts.This dog doesn’t
know he doesn’t have a pedigree! (For more on what makes a mixed breed a mixed breed,
check out Chapter 1.)

The Cockapoo was one of the first designer dogs — intentional crossings of two
purebreds — in the United States.(For more on designer dogs,including the
Cockapoo,turn to Chapter 2.)
Mixed-breed dogs come in all shapes and sizes (see Chapter 3).

Many mixed-breed
dogs are abandoned
by the side of the
road,neglected,or
otherwise mistreated.
If they’re lucky,they
end up in animal 
shelters or rescue
groups — and if
you’re lucky,you’ll 
be able to take one
home with you.
Despite their rocky
start,these dogs can
make wonderful 
companions.(For tips
on finding your new
best friend,check 
out Chapter 4.)
When you bring home a
mixed-breed puppy,be
sure to get a copy of her
vaccination records to
give to your vet.(For
tips on finding a vet who
will be your partner in
caring for your dog
throughout her life,
check out Chapter 13.)

Your mixed breed doesn’t have to
have Retriever blood to love
going into the water after a ball.
(See Chapter 9 for more fun ways
to make sure your dog is getting
enough exercise.)
© CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FURRY KIND
This mixed breed is totally submissive,letting his little friend rub his tummy for as long
as she’ll do it.Dogs and children can become fast friends.Just make sure your kids know
that the dog isn’t a toy — even if he’s a Toy mix! (For more on introducing your family,
including other pets,to your new mixed breed,see Chapter 6.)

You are the center of your dog’s world,and the more time you can spend playing with
her,exercising with her,and just hanging out with her,the happier she’ll be! (For ten
ways to have fun with your dog,see Chapter 19.)
A crate like this one can be
your mixed breed’s “den,”a
safe place he can sleep in or
go when he needs a little
quiet time.It can also be a
huge help when you’re
housetraining your dog and
can’t supervise him 24/7.
(For more on housetraining,
see Chapter 10.)

Don’t let this cute face (and
those ears!) fool you:Like any
dog,a mixed breed needs to be
trained.With the right
approach,training can be a
rewarding experience for you
and your dog.(Check out
Chapter 11 for everything you
need to know to train your
mixed breed.)

Dogs love to dig holes.If you don’t want your mixed breed tearing up your yard,give
him a box filled with sand to dig in (see Chapter 12).

Agility is a great form of exercise for any dog (see Chapter 16).This Eskipoo is a natural!
Your mixed breed will want
to go with you everywhere
you go,even on the water.If
you take your dog boating,
be sure she’s wearing a well-
fitting canine life vest before
she puts her paws on deck,
and keep it on her until she’s
back on dry land.Even if she
can swim,if she falls over-
board she’ll need this added
protection (see Chapter 9).

Dogs love to play tug-of-war with each other.If your mixed breed doesn’t have a
canine companion at home,try taking him to a dog park so he can make some friends
and develop his social skills.Playtime is a great way for your dog to get exercise,too!
(For more on ways to stimulate your dog’s mind,check out Chapter 12.)
Your mixed breed will love hitting the road with you.No matter where you’re going,
she’ll be ready for an adventure! (For tips on what to bring when traveling with your
dog,head to Chapter 17.)
