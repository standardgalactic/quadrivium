About the Authors
Christopher Panza was born and raised in New York. After struggling unsuccess-
fully to fi gure out the meaning of his existence as a young teenager, he decided 
to go to the State University of New York at Purchase, where he could major in 
philosophy and literature and fi gure out all the answers. He got his degree, but 
no fi nal answers to the meaning of life. After college, he spent a few more years 
working in business and hammering away at that meaning-of-life question. In 
frustration, he decided to then attend the University of Connecticut to pursue his 
master’s and doctoral degrees (in philosophy) in order to fi nally get an answer. 
Once again, he accumulated more degrees but arrived no closer to the mean-
ing of life. So he fi gured he’d at least put his degrees to work and has worked 
as a professor in the Philosophy and Religion Department at Drury University, 
in Springfi eld, Missouri, since 2002. He received the University’s Excellence in 
Teaching Award in 2004, which is surprising given that he tries to infect students 
with the same frustrating desire to seek answers to unanswerable questions. In 
addition to his interests in existentialism, Chris has interests in (and teaches on) 
a number of other topics such as ethics, Confucianism, free will, and modern phi-
losophy. Chris is also married and has one three-year-old daughter, Parker, with 
one more addition to the family on the way. Chris is hoping to infect his own chil-
dren one day with the same desire to investigate life that has long invigorated 
him and as a result made life an interesting and mysterious experience.
Gregory Gale discovered existentialism at the tender age of 15 and has been 
dancing over the abyss ever since. After receiving his BA in Philosophy from the 
Colorado College and his MA in Philosophy from the University of Connecticut, 
he went wandering the earth in search of his Dasein. He has spent most of the 
last 15 years teaching everything from Jean-Paul Sartre to Dr. Seuss, and prides 
himself on making diffi cult material accessible to everyone. Most recently, his 
search for meaning, value, and a really good bourbon took him across the 
country in a beat-up Toyota Tercel. He wound up in Las Vegas, Nevada where he 
lives, works, writes, and pursues his philosophical investigations into the exis-
tential signifi cance of Elvis Impersonators, Showgirls, and the Poker Philosophy 
of Doyle Brunson.

Dedication
Christopher Panza: To my wife, Christie, and my daughter, Parker, for their 
never ending source of love and support. Also to my mother Janice, my 
father Tony, and my sister Amy, all of whom have endured having a philoso-
pher in the family for far too long.
Gregory Gale: I’d like to dedicate this book, with much love, to my father, 
Anthony Lloyd Gale, and my mother, Rosemary Gale. From the depth and 
breadth of your humanity, I learned to measure all things. I also dedicate this 
book to my Uncle Steve. Nietzsche said that style is a great art. You were my 
favorite artist.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Christopher Panza: My primary acknowledgement is to my wife, Christie, and 
my daughter, Parker. Both of them had to endure many months of watching me 
type away at a computer instead of engaging in family-oriented projects and 
plans. Christie has been very understanding and supportive of this project, not 
to mention graciously agreeing to read and edit early drafts of a few chapters. 
I’d also like to thank Lisa Esposito, my department head, for helping to arrange 
work assignments (and for taking some on herself) so that this project could 
be completed. Also I’d like to thank Jason Swadley, a former student, for com-
menting on some early chapter drafts. Lastly, I’d like to thank Charlie Ess for 
agreeing to serve as the technical editor for this book and providing many 
good and insightful comments on how to improve the draft.
Gregory Gale: There are too many people to thank, and I apologize in advance 
to anyone I may have forgotten. First off, thanks to the folks at Wiley Publishing 
for making this such a positive experience, and for all the hard work to make 
Existentialism For Dummies the best book it could be. Thanks to our project 
editor, Tim Gallan, for all his patience, hard work, and clear direction, which 
has consistently kept me on the right path. Our copy editor, Sarah Faulkner, 
was magnifi cent and often knew what I was trying to say better than I did. Our 
acquisitions editor, Michael Lewis, helped us distill a massive subject matter 
into a workable project and get it ready for prime time. Charlie Ess kept us 
honest by policing our content and making sure we knew what we were talking 
about. The book is deeper and truer for his efforts. I am deeply grateful to you 
all for your assistance.

I owe my involvement in this project to Adam Potthast; for getting the ball 
rolling I am deeply grateful. Many other friends and family members also 
made this possible through their support and criticism. In particular, Andrea 
and JJ Christensen, Tara Vazquez, David Maddow, and Lorraine Miller threw 
themselves into the project and were a tireless source of interest, questions, 
encouragement, and thoughtful criticism. Each of you has contributed to this 
work and I appreciate each and every one of you.
Finally, I want to thank the teachers who helped make philosophy and exis-
tentialism essential parts of my life. Fr. Richard M. Jacobs got me hooked on 
philosophy when he introduced me to Plato at 14, and used Theology class 
to open my mind rather than close it. Dr. Clark “Doc” Thayer immersed me in 
existentialism and postmodernism. For the former I thank you, for the latter 
I forgive you. Thanks also to John Riker for giving me the courage to follow 
my heart and live the philosophy I was studying. Finally, I must thank too 
many professors to name in the Philosophy Department at the University of 
Connecticut for pushing me harder than I’ve ever been pushed; for teaching 
me that even analytic philosophy can be done with passion, fl air, love, and 
joy; but most of all, for your understanding when I decided it was time for me 
to go. Thank you.
And special thanks to my brilliant and tireless partner, Chris Panza. I could 
not have asked for better. Hey, Chris, I think we’ve almost got that boulder 
up the hill. . . .

Introduction
E
xistentialism is the philosophy of existence, of the nature of human 
existence, its value, and its meaning. Because questions about existence 
have very little interest when people exist as rotting corpses, existentialism 
is really the philosophy that studies what it is to be alive. It isn’t defined 
so much by any unified answer to this question, but by the way in which it 
rejects traditional answers to questions concerning the meaning and value 
of human life, and the way that it insists that such questions are real and 
that the lack of any real answer is a problem. Existentialists, both theist and 
atheist, reject not only traditional religious systems that attempt to system-
atically provide pat answers, but also the possibility of any ultimate answers. 
They insist that even if a God and a heaven exist, the meaning of this life and 
how you should live will always be open questions, requiring decisions you 
must face as an individual. Because existentialism considers the questions 
to be important, it seeks a way of living with the fact that no answers will be 
forthcoming.
The French existentialist Albert Camus says the fundamental question of 
philosophy is that of suicide, of whether life is worth living. Although not 
all the existentialists approach the question from this exact vantage point, 
it illustrates a widely held theme — while traditional religious and ethical 
systems ask, “How should I live?” the existentialist’s more fundamental ques-
tion is, “How can I live?” If life is meaningless, if the inherited stories aren’t 
valid, how can you even approach the question of how you should live? How 
can human beings hungry for meaning live and flourish without giving in to 
despair when no meaning is provided to them?
About This Book
Although this book is about the philosophy of existentialism and about the 
philosophers who developed it, it isn’t a book for philosophers. It’s for you.
We try to strike a balance in writing and structure. We want to meet the 
needs of the student who’s encountering these issues in a classroom setting, 
as well as the needs of the interested layperson who’s encountering them in 
real life. For both, we provide what we hope is an easy-to-read introduction in 
which we attempt to explain the often-complex theories of the existentialists 
in plain, easy-to-understand language.

2
Existentialism For Dummies 
Existentialism is a philosophy that attempts to be relevant to real people 
and real lives, and we attempt to present the material in such a way as to 
highlight its relevance to your own life. We expect that many of the ideas we 
present here will resonate with your own thoughts and concerns. Although 
we encourage you to dive into the rich world of existential philosophy, lit-
erature, and even movies, none of that is required. Each chapter and each 
section stands on its own, independent not only of the other chapters, but 
also of any knowledge of existentialism or philosophy in general. Everyone’s 
welcome; come on in!
Conventions Used in This Book
Philosophy is a very precise discipline, and writing about philosophy nor-
mally requires endless caveats and multiple subclauses and clarifications 
that would make even a lawyer’s head swim. To make a book about the exis-
tentialists readable, we have to gloss over certain distinctions, and to keep 
you from hunting us down and killing us, we avoid endlessly bringing up the 
fine print. But with that in mind, we use the following conventions through-
out the book:
 
 The use of the term existentialism: Many people reject the notion of 
a unified school of thought by this name. One of the things the writers 
we deal with tend to have in common is that they reject the usefulness 
of -isms and would reject the notion that they were part of one. We feel 
it makes perfect sense to speak of existentialism as a school of thought, 
a philosophy, or even a movement as long as you understand that we 
aren’t using the term to imply a definitive statement of what existential-
ism is or of what its proponents accept or believe. Rather, when we talk 
about existentialism, we refer to a set of overlapping themes and con-
cerns that unite what we recognize are often, in many respects, vastly 
different philosophical positions.
 
 The use of the term existentialists: Each of the writers we deal with 
was fiercely independent, and many of them explicitly rejected the label. 
Again, we feel each of the philosophers we discuss in the book qualifies 
as an existentialist, by virtue of addressing a common family of concerns.
 
 Phrases like “the existentialists believed” and “existentialism holds”: 
To the extent that existentialism exists at all, it exists at the intersec-
tion of, and in the overlapping content of, the thoughts of these various 
philosophers. Sometimes when presenting the big picture, however, we 
gloss over the differences among them. When we use phrases like these, 
you can be assured that a general tendency of those we call existential-
ists is to believe some version of the idea we ascribe to them as a group. 

3
 Introduction
Be warned, however, that with just about any general statement about 
this group, at least one member of the group will disagree entirely; the 
rest likely will agree in some sense but disagree on the fine print. Never 
assume from statements like these that all the existentialists believe 
exactly that in exactly that way.
 
 One philosopher at a time: What the existentialists have in common are 
themes and concerns, such as anguish, passion, individuality, and death. 
In approaching these themes, we usually emphasize one philosopher at 
a time. For example, we focus on Nietzsche when dealing with individu-
ality and Kierkegaard when dealing with passion. We feel this format has 
the advantage of focusing the discussions on these topics while giving 
you quality time with each philosopher. These discussions are a good 
way to help you get your head around the subject and understand one 
philosopher’s point of view. Just don’t assume that the philosopher we 
choose represents the final or definitive word of the existentialists on 
that topic.
 
 The use of both past and present tense: Like all important movements, 
existentialism was both of its time and timeless. It reached its zenith in 
the past, and its greatest thinkers lived (and died) in the past. We give 
you this kind of historical information in past tense, but because existen-
tialism is still very much alive for us, we refer to its themes and the writ-
ings of the great philosophers in the present tense.
Foolish Assumptions
Philosophers are trained to avoid assumptions, but Nietzsche said to live 
dangerously, so we went nuts. Here are some of the things we assume about 
you. We assume at least one of these things is true about you; if even one is 
true, this book was written for you:
 
 You don’t wear black all the time, and you have better things to do than 
spend all your time drinking coffee, chain-smoking, and cursing an impo-
tent God (unlike your coauthors, Chris and Greg).
 
 You’ve heard the word existentialism thrown around a lot but aren’t 
really sure what it is and what it’s all about. You’re curious, and you 
want to know more.
 
 You’re a student enrolled in a class, and you need to learn about exis-
tentialism as a whole, a particular thinker, and/or a particular existential 
theme.
 
 You know about one or more of the existentialists, and you want to learn 
more about him or her and the movement he or she was part of.

4
Existentialism For Dummies 
 
 You’re interested in art, film, literature, history, cultural studies, philos-
ophy, psychology, European history, or one of the numerous other fields 
of human endeavor upon which existentialism has had an impact, and 
you want to go to the source to learn more about it.
 
 You’ve at some point questioned the meaning of your life or how to live, 
or you’ve wondered whether there’s anything more.
 
 You’re a Christian, Hindu, atheist, Jew, or agnostic, or you have any 
other belief or concern about what’s ultimately true and ultimately real.
 
 You saw that Brad Pitt movie in which a bunch of guys beat one another 
up and want to know what the point was.
 
 You exist.
How This Book Is Organized
We arranged this book so that you can dive in at any point. Taking a class 
on Sartre? Start with Chapter 8. Kierkegaard? Go straight to Chapter 10. For 
those who want a general overview, we tried to structure the book so that it 
also tells a larger story. The book is broken up into five parts, each of which 
contains a number of chapters covering a related set of topics. You may con-
sider reading Part I to get your feet wet and then skipping around to the sub-
jects that interest you. Any way you feel like doing it works!
Part I: Introducing Existentialism
In this part, we give you a short historical introduction to existentialism and 
its major thinkers. Discover who they were and why they were so important 
to its development.
Part II: The Fundamental 
Problem: God Is Dead
In many respects existentialism is a response to a collection of problems that 
confront you as you try to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. The chapters 
in this part deal with recognizing and defining these problems. We examine 
Nietzsche’s statement that God is dead (a statement that’s about far more 
than just God!) as the fundamental statement of the challenges you face. We 
investigate how God was killed, who’s to blame, and what it really means. 

5
 Introduction
People feel horrible about this statement and what it means, so we discuss 
those feelings. Have a good cry if you want, but it isn’t necessary. Finally, we 
discuss what kind of world you face now that God has turned up deceased 
and why the problem this statement represents exists not just for atheists, 
but for believers as well.
Part III: Living a Meaningful 
Life in a Meaningless World
If the existentialists just moped and cried over everything, they’d never have 
been invited to any parties. Much of the existentialists’ work was devoted to 
finding ways of living, and even flourishing, in a world with the problems we 
describe in Part II. Part III is a collection of these methods, insights, and solu-
tions. Consider it our description of their how-to guide to healthy and satisfy-
ing living.
Part IV: The Enduring Impact 
of Existentialism
In this part we examine the impact existentialism has had on philosophy and 
psychology. We examine why the impact on psychology has been so pro-
found, why its impact on academic philosophy hasn’t been altogether great, 
and what this means for its overall legacy and significance.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens, and we wouldn’t dream of 
leaving it out of this one. For ours, we decided to focus on what makes exis-
tentialism so accessible and relevant — namely, the way it finds its way 
(intentionally or unintentionally) into nonphilosophical, popular work. So we 
list ten terrific books and ten great films that deal with existential themes.
Icons Used in This Book
 
This icon alerts you to items that are particularly important for understand-
ing what existentialism is all about. Pay close attention to these sections and 
keep them in mind while you read other sections. Although the text attached 
to this icon isn’t strictly necessary for understanding other parts of the book, 
it often resonates with things you find elsewhere. Keeping text marked with

this icon in mind can lead to a deeper, richer understanding of what the exis-
tentialists are up to.
 
This icon alerts you to common confusions and misconceptions about existen-
tialism and to information that will help you avoid these pitfalls. Read these 
sections carefully to make sure you have the right idea about what the existen-
tialists are saying.
 
This icon alerts you to direct quotes from the existentialists or other great 
philosophers. These quotes not only give you the philosopher’s ideas straight 
from the horse’s mouth, so to speak, but also help you get some of the color 
and flavor of the rich writing style many of these thinkers employ.
 
Existentialism is a complicated business, but it’s also very personal. Many of 
the existentialists used personal anecdotes to bring the subject down to earth 
and make it more immediate. We try to do the same. Whenever we relay one 
of the existentialists’ anecdotes or one of ours, you see this icon.
 
We use this icon when we want you to think about a discussion point as it 
relates to your own life. Or sometimes we want you to stop and really decide 
whether what we’re discussing has merit. It’s our way of saying, “Take a 
moment.”
 
Sometimes understanding something difficult becomes a piece of cake when 
you look at it from a certain angle or think about it in a certain way. We use 
this icon to alert you to useful pointers that help get you oriented so you know 
the best way to approach this material.
Where to Go from Here
This book is arranged like an existential smorgasbord. Go where you want; 
take what you want! If you know nothing about existentialism at all, you may 
want to take a look at the first chapter. To find out who the players are and 
what they were doing, check out Chapter 2. Or try a sampling from Part II to 
see what problems existentialism is trying to tackle. Or just jump into a chap-
ter that looks interesting. Don’t be afraid; you don’t need to know any of the 
other stuff to understand what’s going on.
If you’re a student, check out the Table of Contents to see what chapters 
deal with the thinkers or issues you’re studying. Don’t see what you’re look-
ing for? Need more? Check out the Index, and find out everywhere we talk 
about Nietzsche, anguish, or lasagna. Most of the major names have at least 
one chapter devoted to their thinking, but they also crop up in various other 
places. 
So where do you go from here? As Sartre might say, you’re free, so choose!

Part I
Introducing 
Existentialism

In this part . . .
M
any ideas past and present are described as exis-
tential, but we use “existentialism” to refer specifi-
cally to a philosophical movement that came about in 
Europe in the late-19th century and achieved its zenith in 
the early- to mid-20th century. Here we put that movement 
into its philosophical and historical context, and introduce 
the individual thinkers who developed existential philoso-
phy. Because these thinkers were so diverse and idiosyn-
cratic, using the term “existentialist” to describe them all is 
somewhat controversial. We discuss the commonalities in 
their thinking that link them all together, if somewhat 
loosely, and the individual contributions of each philoso-
pher that make him or her so important to 
existentialism.

E
xistentialism is the philosophy that makes life possible.
As incomplete as this statement seems, when you understand what it means 
you’re well on your way to understanding what existentialism is all about and 
what the existentialists saw themselves as doing.
But if existentialism is the philosophy that makes life possible, you may ask 
why you need a philosophy for that. Doesn’t oxygen do a pretty good job? 
Yes, quite good — if all you want to do is breathe. According to the existen-
tialists, however, you want to live a full and authentic human life, a rewarding 
and fulfilling life that embraces your human dignity. For that, they say, you 
need, at a minimum, oxygen and a healthy dose of existentialism. To under-
stand why, it may help to consider that many philosophies come about as 
responses to a problem. Necessity is, after all, the mother of invention.
On a very general level, the problem the existentialists were concerned with 
was the problem of meaning. Human beings crave meaning; they crave an 
orderly universe that they can make sense of. When you find that the uni-
verse isn’t going to cooperate, when you discover that the stories you’ve told 
yourself in an attempt to force it to have meaning have ceased to work, you 
feel like you’re a stranger in the world.
This historical circumstance is precisely the one that the existentialists 
found themselves in. As the scientific and Industrial Revolutions came to a 
head in the 19th century, and society became increasingly secularized, the 
traditional social order underwent radical change in a very short time. During 

10
Part I: Introducing Existentialism 
this period, people began to feel disconnected from the traditional belief sys-
tems that had helped them make sense of the world and of their lives. In 
these conditions, people may not literally commit suicide, but a kind of spiri-
tual death — a spiritual suicide — becomes a very real danger. It occurs 
when people give up to resignation and surrender in the face of what they 
see as the pointlessness of their existence.
 
Existentialism is the philosophy that recognizes this problem and attempts to 
address it. If you want to spruce up the description we start with, you might 
say that existentialism is the philosophy that makes an authentically human 
life possible in a meaningless and absurd world.
Because the existentialists were fiercely independent and differed widely 
in both their precise analyses of this problem and in the details of their 
responses, presenting a more detailed definition — one that’s both illuminat-
ing and accurate — is hard to do. What unites the existentialists, besides the 
problems of meaning and existence with which they all wrestled, is a series of 
themes and concerns that informed their discussion of these issues. We 
have, to a large extent, organized this book by these different themes and 
concerns.
Existentialism Is a Philosophy
If you’ve ever asked, “What does it all mean?” or “Why are we here?” or 
“What should I do with my life?” you’ve asked an existential question. Of 
course, these questions have been around since humans came down from 
the trees. Or at least since after they perfected farming, settled down, and 
had time for questions beyond “Where will I get my next meal?” and “Is the 
big toothy thing dangerous?” and “Will eating those mushrooms prevent me 
from living long enough to have offspring who will someday ask about the 
meaning of life?”
 
But asking a deep question doesn’t make you a philosopher. What makes exis-
tentialism a philosophy of existence? Philosophers analyze, they pick apart, 
and they try to come up with reasons for their beliefs and reasoned answers 
for their questions. They also tend to develop systems, but as we discuss in 
Chapter 3, the existentialists aren’t big fans of systems. In the most primitive 
times, human beings didn’t have the time or the literacy necessary for such 
extended reflection and investigation. Even in today’s remarkably literate soci-
ety, the situation is much the same. Think of your own life. You may have 
asked existential questions from time to time, but between taking the kids to 
soccer practice, meeting your boss’s or teacher’s latest deadline, and doing 
your taxes, have you had the time to come up with much in the way of a 
detailed answer?

11
 Chapter 1: What Is Existentialism?
Philosophy develops when a society gets to the point at which at least some 
of the people within it have the leisure not only to sit around asking these 
questions, but also to work out detailed, reasoned responses. Because of phi-
losophy’s complex and abstract nature, it also helps if you can write this stuff 
down. The oral tradition is great for telling historical and religious stories. 
These stories have great complexity, weight, and depth, and many — like the 
epic of Gilgamesh — are even existential in nature. The powerful themes and 
concepts that underlie these stories were fully abstracted from those stories 
only with the advent of writing. The gods’ involvement in the battle of Troy 
over the most beautiful woman in the world is a great story to tell at the 
campfire over a few beers. You can hear it again and again until you know it 
by heart and can start telling it yourself and discussing what it means at the 
next campfire over a few more beers. Plato’s theory of the forms? Heidegger’s 
theory of Dasein? Sartre’s explanation of the for-itself? Not so much.
By the time philosophy got up and running, then, many of these big questions 
already had answers that were widely accepted — even if they weren’t true 
or very helpful. With pockets of exceptions and the stray rebel here and 
there, this general acceptance lasted until the end of the Middle Ages. Only 
then do you see the first real stirrings of modern existentialism, but even 
then, the philosophy is a quiet whisper in the wind for centuries: a mono-
logue in Shakespeare, maybe a few stanzas in Milton. By the 18th century, 
elements of what became existentialism started cropping up regularly in liter-
ature and even philosophy; the whisper grew to a loud murmur. In the 19th 
Is existentialism really a philosophy?
Some have argued that existentialism, espe-
cially as espoused by its earliest thinkers, can’t 
be called a philosophy, because philosophy 
seeks reasons and proceeds on the basis of 
rational and logical arguments. An important 
aspect of existentialism is its irrationalism — 
its belief that rationality isn’t the only or even 
the primary mode of human understanding and 
relating to the world. Further, much of the phi-
losophy is communicated through novels, 
poetry, and parables. These factors have led 
many in the philosophical community to be 
dismissive of the existentialist movement 
as a branch of philosophy. We maintain, as 
many who study existentialism do, that the 
existentialists developed their positions and dis-
covered much that is true through the use of 
careful reasoning. Does this make them hypo-
crites? Not at all. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, 
Nietzsche’s hero tells of meeting an ear that he 
only later realized was attached to the withered 
husk of a man. He is told that the ear-man is a 
great man, but Zarathustra believes he has suf-
fered from having overdeveloped only one part 
of himself. The existentialists don’t make this 
mistake; they reject the exclusive or overdevel-
opment of reason and embrace a broader per-
spective, but they don’t reject their philosophical 
roots entirely.

century, it sprang to life as a cry in the desert, and by the 20th century, it was 
shouted from one side of the Atlantic to the other.
The Top Ten Existential Themes
What unifies the existentialists are the themes and concerns that tend to 
show up in their work. Here are the top ten themes that recur again and again 
in existential philosophy, as well as in art, literature, movies, and any number 
of other fields:
 
 Absurdity: For the existentialists, life is absurd; it makes no sense and 
has no meaning or ultimate purpose, but human beings need it to make 
sense, to have meaning and purpose.
 
 Rejection of meaning-giving narratives: It isn’t enough to say that life 
is absurd; the existentialists repeatedly make the point that when phi-
losophy, religion, or science tries to make sense of it, the attempts 
always fail.
 
 Alienation: This is the feeling that you’re a stranger in your own life, a 
stranger in the world.
 
 Anxiety: This is the feeling of unease you get when you start to recog-
nize that life is absurd.
 
 Forlornness: This is the feeling of loneliness you get when you realize 
that no one can help you make sense of your existence.
 
 Responsibility: Everyone bears responsibility. If no one is going to give 
you a guidebook to life, you have to bear responsibility for making your 
way through it and creating some kind of meaning for it.
 
 Authenticity: People want authenticity — to live in a way that’s in 
tune with the truth of who they are as human beings and the world 
they live in.
 
 Individuality: An important part of developing an authentic and satisfy-
ing life is individuality. Reason, science, and systems that try to cover up 
the absurdity of life often take individuality from you.
 
 Passion/engagement: Being passionate or engaged is another important 
aspect of living an authentic life, and it’s under attack from the same 
forces that take away your individuality.
 
 Death: This is the ultimate context for all human actions and an impor-
tant source of the absurdity of life.

 Chapter 1: What Is Existentialism?
Existentialism’s Place in the 
History of Philosophy
In the ancient world, philosophy was the study of everything there was to 
study. The specialization in most modern endeavors simply wasn’t present. 
This gave philosophy a broad perspective; nothing was off limits. The place 
of human beings in the universe and the meaning of life were questions 
to which the earliest philosophers gave ample attention. Thinkers from 
Epicurus, who advised the pursuit of pleasure, to Aristotle, who advocated 
the pursuit of philosophy, tried to determine what constituted the good life 
and how it could be attained.
Socrates and Plato, two of the earliest and greatest of the major philoso-
phers, were particularly concerned with how a person should live. For them, 
the issue was moral and spiritual. Plato saw justice as the right ordering of 
the soul and compared the philosopher to a doctor whose job it is to look 
after the health and well-being of the soul. Philosophy, then, was a highly 
pragmatic activity aimed at living well.
As society and philosophy developed, however, this orientation changed. 
Over the centuries, the overall tendency in philosophy was to become more 
and more specialized and more and more abstract. Indeed, after Sir Isaac 
Newton became everyone’s paradigm for knowledge, philosophy aimed more 
and more at being scientific. Questions about the meaning of life and health 
of the soul gave way to more technical issues, well removed from the con-
cerns of everyday life. Even ethics became a narrow discipline of separating 
right from wrong, as opposed to determining what makes an entire life 
successful.
Why is it called existentialism?
A more technical definition of existentialism 
reveals the reason for its name. Existentialism 
is the study of existence. If you take existence 
to be everything that exists — such as chairs 
and tables, people and llamas — all philosophy, 
science, and religion would seem to have the 
same subject. But existentialism isn’t the study 
of everything that exists; it’s the study of exis-
tence itself — the study of what it means for 
something to exist at all as opposed to not exist-
ing. It’s also the study of what it means for 
something, as opposed to nothing, to exist at all. 
Of course, the primary focus of existentialism is 
a particular kind of existence, the kind of exis-
tence that includes existing things like you, 
because you’re aware of your existence and 
capable of questioning it.

Part I: Introducing Existentialism 
This is where philosophy was when existentialism burst upon the scene and 
why existentialism was seen as such a radical departure from philosophy as 
it had come to be practiced. We think that in many ways existentialism repre-
sents a return to the roots of philosophy, a return to the ancients’ concern 
with living well and even to their concern with the health of the soul. Although 
most of the existentialists wouldn’t accept the existence of a soul in the sense 
that Plato gives it in his more spiritual moments, they were certainly con-
cerned with the health of all those things traditionally associated with the 
soul, such as will, vitality, joy, and mental strength.

t’s appropriate, and perhaps inevitable, that existentialism came of age 
in the 19th century, a period of unrest and radical social change. Science 
was flowering, belief in the powers of the human mind was reaching a cre-
scendo, and the Industrial Revolution was overturning the traditional social 
order. Forces that had been slowly growing for centuries combined to give 
birth to a decidedly new way of living. The world was rushing headlong into 
becoming the industrial, scientific, capitalist, and mostly secular world you 
know today.
Born into this world were two visionary thinkers, Søren Kierkegaard and 
Friedrich Nietzsche, who both recognized that something was missing, some-
thing was awry in this brave new world. Caught somewhere between the 
stale pieties of the old and the glib fascination of the new, they demanded a 
new assessment of what it means to be human, what it means to live, what 
it means to exist. Both started as the pious sons of deeply religious men. 
From there, they each took one of the two paths that this start often leads to; 
Kierkegaard became a devout Christian and a man of deeply personal faith; 
Nietzsche became something else. Back in grad school, coauthor Greg met a 
fellow student who was a Christian and wanted to study Nietzsche. Why? It’s 
always important, he said, to know your enemy.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the principal existentialists. Besides 
Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, we examine Martin Heidegger and the great 
French existentialists: Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert 
Camus. Heidegger was largely responsible for the development of existen-
tialism into a systematized and (briefly) mainstream philosophy. His pupil, 
Sartre, became the chief exponent of existentialism in France. Although 

16
Part I: Introducing Existentialism 
Sartre and his circle introduced substantive and important modifications to 
existential philosophy, they’re perhaps best known for . . . well, being the 
best-known existential philosophers and for making existentialism a house-
hold name. In our last section, we discuss what has become of the legacy of 
the great existentialists and who, if anyone, is carrying it on.
Kierkegaard Makes Philosophy Personal
Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855) was the son of a wealthy Dutch businessman. 
His father was fiercely intelligent, deeply pious, and burdened by a great mel-
ancholy. It isn’t entirely clear why, but Michael Kierkegaard believed that he 
lived under a great weight of guilt and that his life was accursed because of 
it. His guilt may have been related to a curse he made to heaven in his youth 
or the out-of-wedlock affair he seems to have had with Søren’s mother before 
marrying her. But whatever the reason, he passed this on, along with his 
intelligence and piety, to his son. Themes of guilt, remorse, pain, and 
anguish are constant in Kierkegaard’s work, which is deeply personal and 
often autobiographical.
 
The other major event that plays out repeatedly in his work is his engage-
ment to Regina Olsen. He and Regina fell in love; the young Kierkegaard pro-
posed, and she accepted. Just under a year after their engagement, however, 
Kierkegaard broke off the engagement. Only he knows why — or perhaps not 
even he knew for sure. In part, he seems to have thought that his melancholy 
made him unsuitable as a spouse, but he also seems to have magnified the 
decision whether or not to marry into a question of what form of life he would 
lead. He seems to have thought marriage was antithetical to the study and 
piety to which he chose to devote the rest of his life. The decision scarred 
him, however, and he lived the rest of his life in love with the woman he had 
turned away. He replayed and reexamined that decision in his writings.
Seen by many people as the founder of existentialism, Kierkegaard took 
his melancholy and anguish and started a path of self-discovery. What he 
discovered was truth not only about himself, but also about the human con-
dition. He was one of the first to develop in an extended way (if not quite 
in a systematic way) central existential themes, such as the absurdity and 
forlornness of life, the importance and weight of choices, and the need to live 
passionately and authentically. He developed all these themes in a radically 
new kind of Christian context. He rejected the traditional pieties and system-
atic answers of both philosophy and the orthodox Christianity of his time. 
Instead, he embraced a vision of faith in which belief is considered to be a 
real choice and one that absolutely can’t be validated or justified by reason.

17
 Chapter 2: The Big Names of Existentialism
More than anything, what makes him one of the two founders of existential-
ism is the way he made philosophy personal. The big questions have mean-
ing only in the way they’re lived individually by each person. Reasoned 
calculation or heavenly or church commandments can’t answer questions 
about how to live. You must answer these concrete questions in the depths 
of your individual soul. You must answer questions about how to live, 
whether to believe, and what to do in loneliness and isolation.
Nietzsche Declares that God Is Dead
Although many people call Kierkegaard the founder of existentialism, imag-
ining it without Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) is hard. Many would give 
him as much if not more credit for getting the existential ball rolling. Yet he 
stands apart from the movement he helped to create. It’s been said that call-
ing Nietzsche an existentialist is like calling Jesus a Christian; both are the 
ground of everything that follows, but they transcend it at the same time. You 
could also say that calling Nietzsche the father of existentialism is like calling 
George Washington the father of Philadelphia. Nietzsche is one of the great, 
enigmatic thinkers of human history. Existentialism is certainly his child, but 
he has many, many children and a towering legacy all by himself.
 
Nietzsche was the son of a Lutheran pastor who was the latest in a long line of 
clergy in the family. Nietzsche was headed to the same life, and he embraced 
it with a deep piety in his youth. Nietzsche criticized religion as an insider, or 
former insider, as someone who knew more about Christianity and its signifi-
cance than most practitioners did. Like many who lose their faith, Nietzsche 
spent much of his life criticizing the church for the falsehoods he felt he had 
been taught.
He didn’t stop at the church. Nietzsche was a perceptive social critic, and 
little escaped his vitriol. He tore down everything he saw as false, deluded, 
and damaging to human flourishing. But Nietzsche wasn’t simply an agent of 
destruction. In The Gay Science, he spoke of wanting to be only a yes-sayer, 
to find a way to affirm everything in life. Existentialism gets its fundamental 
optimism from Nietzsche. He had the sense that after we tear down the veil 
of falsehoods we’ve created for ourselves, we can love the world for what it 
really is and create a meaning that’s sustaining and even joyous.
To this end, Nietzsche made his work into a literary dance of destruction, 
creation, and celebration. At times it’s shrill, at other times poetic, but it’s 
always playful and evades easy interpretation or systemization. Nietzsche 
wrote in less traditional forms than any other existentialist. He often wrote 
in the form of relatively short, impressionistic vignettes. In this seemingly 
chaotic but brilliantly orchestrated maelstrom of thought, certain themes 

18
Part I: Introducing Existentialism 
reappear, resonate with other passages, and slowly form into more or less 
concrete, if somewhat slippery, ideas. Of these, we focus on those that are 
most important to later existentialism, particularly his belief that the world 
comes to you as meaningless and that creation — of values, of yourself, of 
the meaning of your life — is your fundamental task. It was Nietzsche who 
announced that God is dead, and as we explain in detail in Chapter 3, this 
statement, properly understood, is the start of all existentialism, even that of 
Kierkegaard and the Christian existentialists.
Heidegger Systematizes Existentialism
Like John the Baptist, the early existentialists had cried almost incoherently 
in the desert. Their writings were read by few people and understood by 
far fewer. Because of their playfulness, their nontraditional writing styles, 
and the extremely personal content of Kierkegaard’s writing in particular, 
the existentialists were easy for mainstream philosophy to ignore, marginal-
ize, and forget. These nuts babbling about anguish and meaning? Nonsense! 
Philosophy was continuing on its traditional, rationalistic path. Increasingly, 
that meant squaring philosophy with science, with the objective and the uni-
versal, not with the individual and the personal.
In British and American philosophy, it has stayed on that course pretty much 
to this day. In Europe, a growing number of people recognized that this path 
didn’t have all the answers it was promising. What existentialism was lack-
ing, however, was respectability. It needed the treatment — the philosophical 
development of its ideas into a great work, an expansive and systematic work 
that the academics could recognize as being something deserving of their 
attention and their respect. This happened not once, but twice — first with 
Martin Heidegger’s magnum opus, Being and Time, and then with his pupil 
Jean-Paul Sartre’s Being and Nothingness. (We discuss Sartre in the next 
section.)
Of all the existentialists, it was Heidegger (1889–1976) who was most purely 
an academic, most purely a philosopher. Although many of the ideas within 
his philosophy are radical, even revolutionary, he presents them with all 
the trappings of traditional, academic philosophy. Like his mentor, Edmund 
Husserl, Heidegger attempted to describe and analyze existence in a way that 
had the rigor and completeness of Newtonian physics but started from the 
inside, from the subjective, human point of view. But what made Heidegger’s 
treatment different was the serious attention he gave to such existential 
themes as irrationalism, the importance of interpretation, living authenti-
cally, and the significance of death in defining human existence.

19
 Chapter 2: The Big Names of Existentialism
It was Heidegger who put the exist into existentialism. Heidegger was con-
cerned not only with living, but also with what it means to be (as opposed 
to not be). In one sense, then, he made existentialism into a science of being. 
Yet, starting as it does from the subjective point of view, it’s a science that 
never objectifies human beings. Indeed, he was at pains to avoid the kind of 
systematizing in which things lose their identity. An important element in his 
philosophy is the way people categorize their experience using words, and 
this process is often alienating. Perhaps, then, none of the figures we refer 
to as existentialists would object to the label so strenuously as Heidegger. 
Heidegger’s work does go significantly beyond what we describe as existen-
tial concerns, and he’s seen as a major figure in other movements, such as 
postmodernism. His elucidation of crucial existential themes and his impact 
upon later existentialists make him impossible to leave out, however. Sorry, 
Marty.
The French Popularize 
a Growing Movement
You aren’t reading this book because of a lonely Dutchman. You aren’t read-
ing this book because of a wild-eyed, self-appointed antichrist who tried 
re-imagining . . . well, everything. You certainly aren’t reading this book 
because a one-time member of the Nazi party wrote one of the most impor-
tant, but also one of the densest and most indecipherable books ever writ-
ten. No, you’re reading this book because for a brief period in the 1940s and 
1950s, nothing was cooler than existentialism. And like Bogart, Elvis, and 
bomber jackets, it’s managed to stay cool and stay relevant. You’re reading 
this book because a few — three, mostly — French philosophers interjected 
existentialism into the consciousness of Western civilization. They inter-
jected it into art, literature, the counterculture, and the fabric of society.
Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) took the traditional existential themes and 
injected a renewed emphasis upon the meaning and importance of human 
freedom. Although Being and Nothingness is a landmark book, even he admit-
ted that he wrote parts of it in a sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled, hyperkinetic 
daze and that those parts are at best poorly written and at worst nonsensi-
cal. What Sartre did better than any previous writer was make existentialism 
accessible to all people to whom it was supposedly relevant. One of the ways 
he did this was through the continual dialogue he engaged in with other 
important movements, including Christianity and Marxism. Sartre was very 
much a public figure involved not only in philosophy, but also in politics, the 
arts, and literature. Although he said he later regretted it, he also wrote the 
ultimate summary of the existential position — Existentialism is a Humanism, 
which is a short essay that attempts to explain the philosophy in nontechni-
cal terms to his critics and the public at large.

20
Part I: Introducing Existentialism 
Like Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986) was involved in politics and 
any number of public issues. Her most enduring legacy has been to define, 
for a generation, the feminist movement in Europe and America. Although 
her groundbreaking work The Second Sex doesn’t deal with existentialism 
directly, her analysis of the place of women in society is erected on a largely 
existential structure. People may not realize it, but often when they’re dis-
cussing feminism, they’re discussing existentialism as well.
But perhaps what most made existentialism accessible was the fact that 
Sartre, de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus (1913–1960) were all authors of novels 
and plays as well as philosophers. Putting their ideas into fiction was putting 
those ideas into the language of the masses. Just as Heidegger gained aca-
demic cred for existentialism by writing a work of great technical precision 
and mastery, the French gave existentialism street cred with their noveliza-
tions and dramatizations, which conveyed existential themes through vivid 
and concrete characters in memorable and emotionally charged stories.
The greatest of these, which is still read widely today, is easily Camus’s 
The Stranger. It’s required reading in countless high school and college lit 
courses, as well as just a darned good book. Perhaps no single work by any 
existentialist has reached more people directly. A tale of absurdity, death, 
and coming to grips with the meaning of one’s existence, it packs much of the 
philosopher’s beliefs about life into a tight, easily digestible package.
Existentialists who believe in God
Atheistic existentialism has come to be seen 
as the dominant strain, largely because it was 
the orientation of Sartre and the other French 
existentialists who popularized it. But from the 
time of Kierkegaard, there has always been a 
persistent and important strain of existentialism 
that embraces the existence of God. Thinkers 
like the Catholic Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973) 
and the Jewish Martin Buber (1878–1965) have 
developed theologies that stress, among other 
things, the importance of personal relationships 
between people and God. Like all existentialists, 
they value the concrete, the personal, and the 
intimate over the systematized and universal. 
They see religion as the lived experience of 
individuals rather than the systematized phi-
losophy of the church or even the Bible.
Like Kierkegaard, the original Christian exis-
tentialist, they reject the notion that faith and 
reason can or need to be reconciled. Reason 
has its place, but it shouldn’t be allowed to 
trump the personal, the individual, and the free 
choice to believe, to have faith, in the absence 
of a complete and final rational proof. Like so 
much of human life, faith and the experience 
of the love of God are essentially irrational, 
and these existentialists see no reason to try 
to apologize for or cover up that fact. In many 
ways, their philosophies are a call to return to 
an earlier time — to a time when religion was 
a personal, immediate, and passionate experi-
ence, as opposed to an overly structured and 
overly intellectualized pursuit of the proper 
procedures and the proper belief with regard 
to some obscure point of theology.

21
 Chapter 2: The Big Names of Existentialism
Contemporary Existentialists 
Keep the Movement Going
Are there contemporary existentialists? Are there still romantic poets? Are 
there still stoic philosophers? Are there still philosophers actively develop-
ing Confucianism? Like all these important movements, existentialism was 
both of its time and place and timeless. There is not now, and probably 
will never be, another purely existential philosopher of the magnitude of 
Kierkegaard, Heidegger, or Sartre. Although we feel the philosophy is as rel-
evant today as it ever was, its contribution to the human discussion has been 
made, and its major tenets were already developed in the classical works that 
fermented so much excitement in its heyday.
To some extent this means enthusiasm has lulled, but don’t read too much 
into it. The Beatles aren’t recording any new albums, either. Like the Beatles, 
existentialism has hardly been forgotten. Existentialism has ingrained itself 
in modern culture in a way that few academic philosophies have ever man-
aged to do. Books and movies in particular continue to give voice to existen-
tial themes (for a list of some of the best, see Chapters 15 and 16). Interest 
in the classics of existentialism remains strong, and their influence persists 
not merely in philosophy, but also in today’s culture, arts, and attitudes. 
Existentialism has always been a very personal philosophy that addresses 
the real human issues everyone faces. The measure of its impact isn’t the 
number of academic philosophers developing its theories, but the number of 
people who are meaningfully affected by its perspective.
Are there contemporary existentialists? Yes. You and us, for a start.

Par  t II
The Fundamental 
Problem: God 
Is Dead

In this part . . .
N
ecessity is the mother of invention, and great 
philosophical problems are the mothers of great 
philosophies. For the existentialist, the mother of all prob-
lems is the death of God, which refers to more than just a 
religious figure and plagues even those who still believe. 
The death of God refers to the religious and philosophical 
systems of thought that human beings have created to 
make sense of their world. The fact that they’re dead 
means they no longer have the clout to underwrite the 
sense of meaning, order, and purpose that humans desire, 
even need. Emotions such as angst, dread, and anxiety 
awaken you to the cracks in these systems, and force you 
to face your existence unadorned and square in the face.
Although that may sound like a bummer, it’s really a good 
thing. Although these emotions are alerting you to a prob-
lem, they’re also alerting you to the new possibilities that 
open up for you when you face the reality of your situa-
tion honestly. The situation you must face is the funda-
mental absurdity of life. Facing this situation holds the 
promise of living authentically, in tune with who and what 
you are, rather than being at odds with and alienated from 
yourself. The promise, in short, of living in a way that’s 
more spiritually healthy, life-affirming, and satisfying.

E
instein said that a little letter called e equals mc2; Descartes said, “I 
think, therefore I am”; and Fred Flintstone said, “Yabba dabba doo!” 
Nietzsche will forever be remembered for saying, “God is dead.” If you’re 
unfamiliar with Nietzsche, and especially if you’re religious, it wouldn’t be 
surprising if you presume that his tone is mocking or gloating. Nietzsche 
could be quite mischievous and certainly wasn’t above taking this tone with 
his adversaries (or his friends!), including Christians and other theists. When 
he speaks of the death of God, however, his tone is more somber.
“Where has God gone?” [the madman asked] “I shall tell you. We have 
killed him — you and I. We are his murderers. But how have we done this? 
How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe 
away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained the earth 
from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away 
from all suns? Are we not perpetually falling? Backward, sideward, forward, 
in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through 
an infinite nothing?
“. . . Where is God? God is Dead. God remains dead. And we have killed 
him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves?”
—Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science
So the death of God is a bloody and painful affair. But what of the question in 
the title of this chapter? Does his death mean life is meaningless? The answer 
to this question is simple. It’s yes. Well, and no, actually. “God,” in the various 

26
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
senses we describe in this chapter, has been the source and keeper of all 
value and meaning for the world. When you “kill God,” you lose this. As 
Nietzsche says, you “wipe away the entire horizon.” When you remove this 
heavenly horizon, you’re left in a world without meaning. So yes, life without 
God is meaningless.
But God was always a bit of a hoarder. He kept all that meaning and all that 
value for himself — keeping it all in his heaven. So in a sense that we explain 
more fully in coming sections, the world as you experience it and live in it 
day to day was already devoid of meaning. It was allowed to borrow a certain 
amount to justify its existence, but it never had any of its own. This is why 
the death of God is so momentous for Nietzsche — and why we see it as the 
jumping-off point for all existentialism. Only after the death of God can you 
face the meaninglessness of the world and realize it’s up to you to take 
responsibility for the direction of your own life.
 
And this is the very important sense in which the answer is no. Reflecting on 
the death of God, Nietzsche asks, “Is not the greatness of this deed too great 
for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it? There 
has never been a greater deed; and whosoever shall be born after us — for the 
sake of this deed he shall be part of a higher history than all history hitherto.”
The world is inherently meaningless, but the essential movement of existen-
tialism is to assert that it doesn’t have to stay that way. We take over the 
responsibility for overseeing meaning in the world. This task isn’t easy, and 
it’s not to be taken lightly. God has done the job for well over 2,000 years; we 
can expect it to take us a while to get the hang of it.
 
The death of God means human beings no longer have a ready source of 
value, but it also means that whatever value we can find, or make, won’t be 
kept at arm’s length from us or from the world we live in.
In this chapter, we examine what Nietzsche really meant by the death of God, 
and how it’s a statement about more than just that guy in the Christian and 
Jewish scriptures or the Koran (among other holy works). In particular, we 
examine how this death concerns three absolute systems of thought: ratio-
nalism, religion, and science.
Who Died? What the 
Death of God Means
On one level, the death of God can be taken fairly literally. God is dead, or no 
longer viable, as a philosophical concept. Philosophers have for eons loved 

27
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
to debate the existence of God. Many philosophical proofs of God’s existence 
(we aren’t saying good ones) have been made, as well as a few proofs against, 
the primary argument being the existence of evil (again, we aren’t saying 
good ones). Nietzsche and the other existentialists don’t involve themselves 
in this debate.
Just an observation, not a celebration
 
The death of God isn’t a triumphant call of “we won the argument.” Rather, it’s 
a recognition of what’s considered by these existential thinkers to be an 
observable, sociological fact — that God and the church aren’t at the center of 
town anymore. More important, they aren’t at the center of people’s thinking 
and no longer have the clout to underwrite values and meaning in modern 
society.
So in this sense, God is that sacred being who, according to the world’s major 
monotheistic religions, authors our existence and gives it meaning and pur-
pose. You’re valuable, in this narrative, because God loves you and has a 
plan for you. Further, if God created everything, then, like you, everything 
has a purpose — “a place for everything and everything in its place,” as the 
old saw goes. With a living God, the universe is a very orderly place. 
Everything has purpose, everything has a reason, and everything is valuable 
because God created it with that purpose in mind and (according to most 
versions) loves the creation of his hands.
The death of absolute systems of thought
Although monotheism does a great job of making sense of the world and of 
making it an orderly place with a discernable meaning and purpose, it doesn’t 
have a monopoly on this activity. Philosophy, science and nonmonotheistic 
religions all try, among other things, to develop explanatory schemes that 
will make sense of the world and your place in it. In doing so, they tend to get 
a bit carried away. They try to create systems of thought, broad theories or 
grand narratives that try to explain everything. Further, the explanations they 
provide tend to be top-down; the stories told by philosophy, science, and 
religions provide the answers to you, rather than involve you in their devel-
opment in a personal way. When Nietzsche announces the death of God, he’s 
really announcing the death of the viability of all these top-down explanatory 
schemes.
 
For simplicity, we refer to all such attempts to rationally order and make 
sense of the world as absolute systems. The philosophy of Plato and the theol-
ogy of the Catholic Church are examples of absolute systems. (If you want to 
blur the distinctions among denominations, as Nietzsche often does, all of 
Christianity can be seen as an absolute system.) They can also be thought of 

28
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
as absolute narratives because they try to bring everything in the world into 
one coherent story, or set of stories, that explains everything. The explana-
tions, or stories, that absolute systems provide attempt to give the world a 
meaningful context. For this reason, those explanations are often referred to 
as meaning narratives. For example, the notions of heaven and hell are part of 
the meaning narrative provided by many, but not all, forms of Christianity to 
place human action in a meaningful context by assuring us that the good are 
rewarded and the evil punished.
Absolute systems are absolute in two ways:
 
 They explain, or at least give a context to, everything. According to 
these systems of thought, nothing can’t, at least in theory, be under-
stood in terms of the system. As we write this chapter, several American 
preachers have come under fire for suggesting that events such as 
Hurricane Katrina and the attacks of 9/11 were the retribution of an 
angry God. Meanwhile, in the halls of academia, some biologists and 
evolutionary psychologists are suggesting that ethics should be under-
stood primarily in Darwinian terms. Each absolute system tends to insist 
that things be understood first and foremost in its terms.
 
 The system becomes the final arbiter of truth and reality. Just as the 
Supreme Court in the United States is the final arbiter of what the 
Constitution says and means, the absolute system — whether it’s 
Christianity, paganism, science, or Platonism — is the highest court of 
appeal for questions of ultimate reality. This is one reason why the exis-
tentialists are so touchy about being called existentialists; they don’t 
want their thinking to be confused with an absolute system.
Another thing to remember about absolute systems is that they tend to be 
abstract and impersonal. In one sense, this can be a good and useful thing. 
The Declaration of Independence borrows from traditional, theistic, absolute 
systems when it states that all men are “endowed by their Creator with cer-
tain unalienable rights.” If you overlook the sexist language of the times, this 
means — in theory, at least — that everyone gets to be treated well and have 
his rights respected. Resting as it so often does on the concept of “God-given 
rights,” the concept of equal treatment before the law is very much a product 
of absolute systems. (Perhaps this is why existentialists haven’t always been 
big fans of liberal democracy. For more on this subject, see Chapter 12.)
But look again at the nature of these absolute systems. Although they have 
their uses, one problem with absolute systems is that . . . well, they’re so 
absolute. You always have a tension between the requirements of an abso-
lute system and its application to individual, concrete people. Even when an 
absolute system provides meaning, it does so only at a distance from the 
individual. This meaning is often prewrapped and segregated from the human 

29
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
lives it’s meant to sustain. As we discuss in later sections, most absolute sys-
tems historically have gone a step further and consciously removed meaning 
and value from human beings and the world they live in.
 
Although absolute systems serve a function, they aren’t without their price. So 
although the deaths of God, of religion, and of all other absolute systems are 
seen as traumatic events, they also raise tremendous possibilities for human-
izing your confrontation with your own existence. When the system is removed, 
you must confront that existence directly and without any false narratives 
intervening or comforting you. But you also get to confront your existence 
directly, honestly, and with human dignity.
You can, of course, confront your existence honestly by using perspectives 
garnered from reason, philosophy, religion, or science. These things aren’t 
necessarily pernicious in and of themselves. Only when you turn them into 
receptacles of all meaning, and subsume yourself and your humanity to their 
proclamations, do you turn them into absolute systems. Human beings have 
a tendency to do this — to let too much of a good thing take over and 
become a monolithic source of direction. To understand absolute systems in 
more detail, read the next three sections. We examine three perspectives 
that at one time or another have been elevated to the status of absolute 
systems — rationalism, religion, and science — and explain why the existen-
tialists see each of them as flawed and not viable as a source of an ordered 
understanding of the universe and our place within it.
Taking the measure of things
The Greek philosopher Protagoras famously 
said, “Man is the measure of all things: of 
things which are, that they are, and of things 
which are not, that they are not.” Plato vilified 
Protagoras as a sophist — a teacher of rheto-
ric who taught his students to develop the most 
persuasive speeches without regard to logic 
or the pursuit of truth (sophists were one part 
lawyer, one part political consultant).
The statement exists only as a fragment, so 
assessing the exact meaning Protagoras had 
in mind is hard to do. If you interpret it as saying 
that ultimately, human beings must assess the 
world and its meaning, this is very close to what 
the existentialists have in mind. But if you tweak 
the statement, you can make it into a pretty fair 
account of the traditional view to which the 
existentialists are opposed: “Absolute systems 
are the measure of all things: of things which are 
meaningful, that they are, and of things which 
are not meaningful, that they are not.” Notice 
the impersonal and preconditioned nature of 
this statement. The human element, with its 
passions, individual projects, and concrete 
existence, is completely removed. You can see, 
as Sartre did, the existentialists as humanists 
who believe that philosophy should center on 
the subjective human element. Existentialism, 
however, is also a rebellion against systems 
of thought that dehumanize you by removing 
the human element and involvement from the 
assessment of meaning.

Killing the God Called Reason
Reason has been the obsession of Western philosophy for well over 2,000 
years. Plato, whom we discuss more later in this chapter, came to be seen by 
many people as the patron saint of reason. Plato’s treatment of reason and of 
human passions is more complex and subtle than that of most of those who 
followed him. Indeed, existentialism in many ways harkens back to Plato’s 
more balanced view of humanity, in which reason is seen as working in tandem 
with certain rightly ordered emotions. In the end, however, the emphasis 
in Plato’s philosophy, which is magnified only in later interpretations — 
including those of the early Christians — is on the importance of our capacity 
to reason. Among other things, he extolled reason’s ability to rule over and 
control human passions, particularly the bodily passions, which were largely 
seen (and still are, in many quarters) as being dangerous and destructive, with-
out much in the way of redeeming qualities.
Any subtlety in the rationalism of Plato had pretty much evaporated by the 
time the existentialists were writing. Reason, in the modern sense, refers to 
your ability to, among other things, calculate, think logically and abstractly, 
weigh evidence, and process and categorize experience. In that sense, reason 
is often conflated in the history of Western thought with your conscience, 
your will, even your very self.
Western philosophy is largely rationalistic in the sense that it glorifies your 
ability to reason over your other traits and capacities. Rationalism is most 
basically a belief in the effectiveness of your reasoning and its centrality to 
who you are. Reason, by this way of thinking, not only allows you to plan and 
project ways of getting what you want, but also has the ability to determine 
what you should want — to determine the best form of life. Reason is the 
granddaddy of all absolute systems of thought, because reason — with its 
parsing, categorizing, and abstracting of experience — creates these systems. 
By creating these systems — including religious systems — human reason 
provides many meaning-giving narratives. So why rebel against reason?
What reason is all about
You can better understand the existentialists’ problem with rationalism if 
you examine some of reason’s characteristics:
 
 Reason discovers universal truths: Two plus two doesn’t equal four for 
you and three for us. Mathematics is universal. Similarly, if you’re on the 
moon and we’re on Jupiter, you’ll feel the effects of gravity differently 
from the way we do. Using his reason, however, Sir Isaac Newton was 

31
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
able to develop the Law of Universal Gravitation, which explains the 
effects of gravity in both places and everywhere else as well. Reason by 
its nature, then, tries to explain away difference and show how every-
thing fits under a simple set of uniform laws.
 
 Reason is abstract: To be universal, the laws of reason must not depend 
upon the particulars of a situation. It doesn’t matter whether you’re 
adding two apples to two apples, two oranges to two oranges, or two 
apples to two oranges — the answer is always four. The particulars 
don’t matter. Of course, some details do matter, but all rational thinking 
tries to abstract from the particulars as much as possible. For example, 
gravity affects a large mass differently from a small mass. This particular 
difference matters to the science of gravity. But does it matter whether 
the large mass is an elephant or a Toyota? Whether it’s blue or pink? 
Whether it’s a human being or a stone? Not at all.
 
 Reason is impersonal: In the classic scientific model, you’re supposed 
to use reason without emotion. To some extent, this thought is the logi-
cal consequence of the first two points. They remove any possible emo-
tional content from the objects of reason by abstracting them until they 
cease to be objects of any feeling. When a person becomes a number, 
there’s nothing left to empathize with. But lack of emotional content is 
also, ideally, a characteristic of the rational agent doing the thinking. To 
think perfectly rationally is to become as computerlike as possible: a 
pure impartial processor of impersonal facts.
Where’s the human element?
The existentialists reject the notion that the exercise of reason can be the 
paradigmatic exercise of your humanity, because for them, life is essentially 
concrete and subjective. Your humanity happens in all those places that get 
factored out when you try to approach things rationally. The more purely 
rational institutions become, then, the more abstract and distant they 
become. You’ve probably had experiences dealing with rational individuals 
or institutions that made you just want to scream. Sometimes, even when 
they’re right, they’re wrong. They miss the point of the question — they miss 
the human element.
 
For example, when coauthor Greg was an infant, he became very sick, and his 
parents took him to the hospital. While waiting in the hall for word about his 
condition, they asked a passing doctor, who informed them, matter-of-factly, 
that Greg probably wouldn’t last the week and then continued walking. 
Ignoring the factual error, this small encounter can be seen as a metaphor for 
the dehumanizing element in all rationalistic systems. Although they provide 
some guidance, like all super-rational elements in society, they do so at a dis-
tance. You sit in the universe’s waiting room hoping for some word from an 

32
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
absolute system that will redeem your situation — give it meaning — but it 
does so only on its own highly abstract and impersonal terms. Reason is dead, 
then, not so much because it can’t find any answers, but because the answers 
provided by reason alone are incapable of addressing real human needs.
Plato: The good stuff is elsewhere
Christianity is Platonism for the masses.
—Friedrich Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil
It’s been said that all philosophy is a series of footnotes to Plato. If that’s 
true, existentialism can be seen as one long, angry footnote objecting to 
Plato’s misplacement of the meaning of life. But Plato isn’t important just 
to academic philosophers. Platonic ideas were taken very seriously and 
shaped much of the interpretation of the words of a simple carpenter from 
Bethlehem who also had a little impact on society. Much of existentialist criti-
cism of Christianity (though certainly not all of it) can be traced to what 
many, including Nietzsche, regard as its Platonism.
Reason as the source of religion?
It may seem a contradiction to say that reason 
is the source of religion. Religion is about the 
spiritual, the mystical, and the unexplainable, 
right? This is true, but although the individual 
pieces of a religion may be mysterious and mag-
ical, when those pieces are coordinated into a 
belief system and the behaviors expected into a 
moral system, reason is at work. Reason takes 
a hodgepodge collection of mystical beliefs and 
practices and forms them into a religion. The 
Catholic church is the most obvious, but hardly 
the only, example of an institution offering an 
intricately ordered and thoroughly system-
atized belief structure. The Inquisition wasn’t 
a product of the experience of a loving God; it 
was the enforcement of a certain set of ratio-
nally ordered precepts about that God which 
the church judged essential to being a right-
thinking Christian. Similarly today, when Pat 
Roberson states that 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina 
was the product of a sinful lifestyle, as crazy as 
that sounds, he doesn’t reference the mystery 
of the Holy Trinity. He tries to rationally weave 
events and beliefs together to form a coherent 
narrative. Many scientists and rationalist athe-
ists point to examples like these to illustrate 
the damage they say belief in God causes. 
The truth, however, is that by themselves, the 
experiences of faith, loving God, and loving thy 
neighbor rarely get people into too much trou-
ble. Only when these feelings are lost or twisted 
by faulty or excessive reasoning into inhumane 
narratives does the trouble start. This insight 
is the starting point of much of Christian exis-
tentialism, which attempts to strip religion of its 
rationalistic and oversystematized architecture 
and get back to a more direct experience of 
divinity and humanity.

33
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
 
A word of warning concerning the picture of both Plato and Christianity pre-
sented here: Both Platonism and Christianity are incredibly complex, broad, 
and rich systems of thought. Although Nietzsche often presents himself as an 
anti-Christian and an anti-Platonist, his thoughts and feelings about them are 
often conflicted. In many respects, he has a love–hate relationship with each. 
In what follows, we focus on the development of one strain of thought that 
begins as a kernel in Plato’s philosophy and becomes magnified into a power-
ful force in Christian thinking. What Nietzsche objects to is the development of 
the idea that a true world exists, next to which ours is a poor copy. This 
notion of the true world is similarly rejected by later existentialists who stress 
the need to focus attention on this world — the human world.
In search of perfect forms
We don’t try to explain Plato’s entire complex body of work, but most of 
what’s important for our purposes can be summed up in his theory of the 
forms — a theory in which Nietzsche interprets Plato as rationally abstracting 
everything good out of the world and paving the way for much of what he 
finds most objectionable in Christianity. The Greeks were fascinated by the 
relationship between the one and the many. Take men, for example. There 
are many men — tall men, short men, fat men, skinny men, brave men, cow-
ardly men, men with one leg, men with one eye, and even men who don’t 
have . . . well, what many of us take to be definitive of our manhood. Eunuchs 
are still men. As we write this chapter, the news recently announced the 
story of a pregnant man. No definition seems to cover all the exceptions. So 
what makes this man (suave, dashing, clean-shaven Chris) and that man (cur-
mudgeonly, bearded, Danny DeVito-esque Greg) both men?
We can ask the same question of things like goodness, justice, and courage. 
Many of Plato’s dialogues describe conversations in which his former mentor 
and full-time literary mouthpiece Socrates asks supposed experts in these 
subjects what the meanings of these big words are. The problem is, as with 
men, every time you come up with a definition, at least one instance doesn’t 
seem to fit. So what’s Plato’s answer? The forms. Think of a form as a tem-
plate, an exemplar. For every thing, for every concept, the form is the perfect 
example of that thing. When you say a word like good or man or lasagna, 
you’re referring to this ultimate example, this perfect version of the item. All 
other instances of these things, like this man or that lasagna, are but imper-
fect copies. (Greg thinks this is pretty plausible, because every lasagna he’s 
ever tasted except for his mother’s homemade lasagna is a pale imitation. 
Chris thinks Greg doesn’t understand Plato; read on to see why.)
So where are all these forms, and how do you know they exist, anyway? As 
for the second question, you know they exist not because you see them, but 
through the exercise of your reason, which is able to comprehend what’s 
abstract and universal. Your senses can perceive only what’s limited and par-
ticular. But your reason comprehends perfect, universal truths like those of 

34
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
mathematics and geometry. You can’t see any perfect circles; all are marred 
by minor imperfections. But your reason can determine how the radius of a 
perfect circle would be related to its diameter, if you could find one.
Forms are good; the physical world is bad
So where are this perfect circle and the rest of the forms? In Plato’s house? At 
the British Museum? No, forms aren’t worldly. (Sorry, Mrs. Gale, your lasagna 
doesn’t count.) In Plato’s philosophy, they live in their own realm of ultimate 
truth and perfection. It’s a perfect place, an immaterial place, a . . . heavenly 
place. And all the forms revolve around the one most perfect form, the form 
of ultimate unity and perfection — the good. Souls come from this place and 
yearn to return. And if you’re very, very good, and spend a lot of time exercis-
ing your reason and ignoring your physical passions, you’ll eventually go 
back. Until then, you’re stuck here, along with everyone else — in imperfect 
bodies, in an imperfect world that’s only a pale shadow of the true world. 
What Platonism represents is the introduction of dualism, a split or separa-
tion between the spiritual and the physical, between rational souls and irra-
tional, passionate bodies, and (most important) between the true world and 
this world of shadowy appearances. The former things are good, and the 
latter things are bad, or at least lacking in the true perfection that lies else-
where. Plato himself recognizes this problem and tries to rectify it by saying, 
among other things, that physical objects “participate” in the forms. In this 
way and others, he tries to unify, or at least connect, the two worlds. But con-
cepts like participation are never fully explained. So what starts as a crack in 
Plato’s philosophy develops into a full-grown split that, fairly or unfairly, is 
attributed to Plato himself by Nietzsche and others.
The existential objection
Wait, wait, wait! You start with a question essentially about the meaning of 
words, and now, suddenly, all truth, all meaning, all value have been taken 
from you and placed somewhere else. Plato creates an absolute system of 
thought in which the world is a miserable, debased copy of something else, 
something you can’t see or touch or smell. He says many of your own feelings 
and emotions are misguided.
“Foul!” the existentialist cries. “I want my meaning. I want my value back here! 
How dare you take it from me, Plato? I want a humanity with dignity! How 
dare you shame me?”
But of course, Plato isn’t alone. Nietzsche feels that Plato’s narrative of the 
true world repeats itself again and again in the history of both religion and 
philosophy. Much of Christianity, for example, adopts this dualistic picture. 
God, heaven, and immortal souls are the things that are most ultimately real, 
good, true, and of ultimate value. The world, on the other hand, is the devil’s 
playground. It’s a fleeting place of pain, suffering, and confusion where hope 
rests in the belief that your soul partakes in something more, something 
greater than this world, and that someday, that soul may escape this mortal 
prison and attain that other world.

35
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
For Plato, the consolation is that this other world can be glimpsed here and 
now; it’s evident through the use of reason. For true-believing Christians, 
especially for the Christians living in the time when the religion was most 
alive, the true world isn’t something that can be seen in this world, but its 
promise is so real and so certain that it’s palpable. As science progresses, 
however, the real world of heaven and ultimate reality are pushed farther 
and farther into the distance. This world becomes more and more the center 
of attention. But as we discuss in the following sections, that attention 
doesn’t reverse what Plato did. The separation of the world of value from the 
world you live in is a persistent issue, and one that the existentialists are all 
committed to rejecting and correcting.
Kant: The world isn’t knowable
If God wasn’t dead when Kant was writing, he was on serious life support — 
life support that Kant’s own philosophy tried to supply. Kant represents a 
transition between the living God of Plato and the early Christians and 
today’s secular, scientific society in which God is no longer a defining con-
cept. Kant lived in an age still recovering from, and in many ways still teth-
ered to, medieval concepts of God and religion. These ideas had just started 
to become untenable, just started their decline as totally dominant systems 
Happiness versus meaning
Nietzsche sees God’s death as a problem. It’s a 
problem many of his contemporaries also wres-
tle with in their increasingly secular society. The 
English in the 18th century developed a rational-
istic, secular moral system that still influences 
people today. It’s called utilitarianism, and it 
attempts to explain how people can act morally 
in a modern, scientific world devoid of supersti-
tion. They start with a simple premise: What all 
people really desire is happiness. From there, 
they proceed logically, methodically, and scien-
tifically to show that all right action is aimed at 
maximizing happiness and that the right thing to 
do in any situation is the product of a calculus 
weighing all the consequences of any action 
upon the happiness of yourself and others.
One quick way to understand the existential-
ists is to look at these English philosophers and 
realize that what the existentialists are doing 
is exactly not that. As Nietzsche wryly notes in 
response to these philosophers, “Man does not 
desire happiness. Only the Englishman desires 
that.” According to Nietzsche, what you actu-
ally want, what you need, is meaning. You need 
your life to make some kind of sense and fit into 
some kind of pattern. History shows repeatedly 
that people can suffer horribly if they believe 
that suffering means something, if they’re sac-
rificing for something they believe in.

36
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
of belief that determined every aspect of life and social structure. In attempt-
ing to make room for them, Kant illustrates how these narratives are failing — 
how people are more distant from God, heaven, and the meaning and value 
they conferred.
Kant created a rational philosophy that he felt would make room for religious 
faith in a world increasingly dominated by science and skepticism concerning 
the knowability of ultimate truths. To do this, he limited the scope of reason 
to separate a realm of scientific, rational inquiry (knowable by human reason) 
from the realm of faith and ultimate reality (its ultimate nature unknowable 
by human reason). For our purposes, his doing this has three significant 
effects:
 
 It severs faith and reason. The church’s traditional attitude toward the 
two was that they’re compatible and converge in the same ultimate truth. 
With the growing ascendancy of science, the church’s response was simi-
lar (after certain reactionary factions within it accepted they could never 
burn enough heretics to make the new science go away, that is). Scientific 
truth is simply the revelation of the mechanics of God’s creation. After 
Kant, however, this position became less and less philosophically tenable. 
Kant was himself both a spiritual man and a rationalist. For him to sever 
these two realms signaled that a fundamental disconnect existed between 
them and that the two grand writers of human narratives — reason and 
religion — were coming into direct conflict.
 
 It signals a crisis in the ability of the defining systems of human soci-
ety to be complete, total, and absolute definitions of reality. Absolute 
systems that once held people’s undivided attention and provided them 
with convincing narratives in which they could place total confidence 
and trust had begun to break down. At this point, these systems could 
provide answers, but they could no longer provide the answers.
 
 It alienates people further from their sources of value and meaning. 
For Kant, the truths of heaven still are ultimately true and ultimately 
real. But whereas the church says these truths are knowable by divine 
revelation and reinforced by the findings of science, and Plato says you 
can come to know them through the exercise of your reason, for Kant, 
their ultimate nature is wholly unknowable. More important, within 
Kant’s philosophy the world as it’s studied by human science is so 
removed from the world of ultimate truth that the earthly truths of the 
former can’t tell us anything about the truths of the latter.
 
 Faith in heaven is spared, but the victory is somewhat Pyrrhic. Reason 
and religious revelation are both crippled, and the realm that contains 
everything of value for human beings is put off at an even greater dis-
tance. Kant wasn’t an existentialist, but it’s hardly surprising that many 
of the existentialists were influenced heavily by him and by what they 
saw as his failure to ultimately save either reason or religion.

37
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
The Death of God and Religion
Although the death of God isn’t just about God, it certainly is about God. 
Perhaps more accurately, it’s about religion, and God is simply the focus. 
Religion, however, provides the answer and gives God his place and his 
meaning. Think of the differences between the religion of Hebrew scriptures, 
in which the will of God is expressed by a multiplicity of laws and rules, and 
the God of the Christian scriptures, in which Jesus boils these command-
ments down to their essentials in the love of God and the love of your neigh-
bor. Here, you have different conceptualizations of the same God, and even of 
the same rules, within one broad tradition. Then you have even greater differ-
ences between the Judeo-Christian version(s) of God and the understanding 
of divinity in pagan and Eastern religions.
Religion puts everything, even God, in its place. It orders the universe and 
makes sense of it — gives it meaning. It does this by creating a narrative 
about God, about who he is, what he wants, and how you’re related to him. 
Your meaning, your understanding of your place in the universe, and even 
your understanding of your relationship to other people is defined in terms 
of your relationship to God. The death of God, as it relates to religion, is 
saying that traditional narratives about this relationship have broken down. 
They no longer have what it takes to underwrite your understanding of your 
place in the universe.
How Christianity lost its mojo
Christianity went through two stages in which it was wildly successful, in 
which whatever criticism you could make against it, you’d have to acknowl-
edge that God was alive and well. Here are those two stages:
 
 Early Christianity: Early Christians tended to keep to themselves; they 
lived in small, often communal, groupings. More than at any other time, 
perhaps, Christianity then wasn’t just a set of beliefs, but a way of life. 
Even the Christians’ Roman oppressors often remarked favorably upon 
their integrity and faithfulness to their beliefs. Nietzsche said people 
should live dangerously, and the early Christians often did. Saying you 
loved Jesus didn’t make you an acceptable political candidate; it made 
you look tasty to lions. It also made you something of an outsider. 
Christian faith wasn’t just something you inherited from the folks or 
took up because it was what people do. It was the product of an 
involved and often impassioned choice. Christian communities rein-
forced this choice less through sanction than through an intimately 
shared passion and a shared vision of life. If you walk among the Hasidic 

38
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Jews of Brooklyn or the Amish of the Dutch country in Pennsylvania 
today, you may wonder whether God is really dead for these people. 
Like the early Christians, they arrange their entire lives by the narrative 
of their religion.
 
 Medieval Christianity: Small communities can be organized and 
arranged in the way of early Christianity, but as the number of people in 
a group grows, as the followers multiply, the nature of faith changes. 
Humans also seem to naturally drift toward and to accept hierarchical 
structures. As Christianity developed, it grew from an experience into a 
system — a theological system with a highly organized and detailed 
belief structure and a political system that dispensed both knowledge 
and power in a hierarchical structure. Although many people consider 
this in itself to be the death of true religion, the church flourished as an 
absolute system putting everything — from God to kings to peasants — 
in its precise place. During the ascendancy of this system, everyone 
knew his place, and everyone knew what it meant to be alive. The 
church’s narrative was (basically) universally accepted and provided 
the ground upon which society and everyone in it stood and lived their 
lives.
After the church became an absolute system, however, it became vulnerable. 
The problem with absolute systems is that they’re so absolute. One of the 
reasons institutions like the church are so conservative and so hostile to any 
beliefs that don’t fit is that the basis of the absolute system is precisely that 
everything does fit. After you start monkeying with its fundamental premises, 
you may be able to rework things intellectually and arrange them so that they 
fit with the new ideas. But you’ve already irrevocably contradicted the sys-
tem’s most fundamental premise: that the universe is an orderly place and 
that this system reveals that order, understands the place of everything, and 
can be a guide for understanding your place in that universe.
So when troublemakers like Copernicus assert that, scientifically speaking, it 
makes more sense to say that the earth revolves around the sun, there’s 
some justice in the church’s claim that this is heretical and will tear down all 
pious belief. In the long run, it did. Like a Jenga puzzle falling apart in slow 
motion, the slow advance of science collapsed both the perfect, all-inclusive 
worldview the church had created and the church’s role as final arbiter of 
truth as author of that worldview. In many respects, what’s most surprising 
about the church’s response to thinkers like Copernicus and Galileo is that it 
wasn’t more antagonistic toward them than it was.
Likewise, as its political power waned, the church became one of many com-
peting powers and influences upon society. But an absolute system thrives 
on being singular. It wasn’t just the church’s influence and power that waned, 
but, as we discuss in the next section, its ability to underwrite meaning and 

39
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
value for its constituents. After the church became one power among many, 
following it became a choice to one degree or another. But that implies an 
open question. After this happens, the luster and security of absolute cer-
tainty is lost, and the hold the church has on society is broken. Without the 
gravitational force of this absolute certainty and the reassurance and stabil-
ity that provides, people tend to drift away not only from church member-
ship, but also from a wholehearted acceptance of the church’s narrative.
Being religious isn’t a “Get 
out of jail free” card
By the 19th century, when the first existentialists were writing, the narrative 
of the church had largely broken down. Much of the public piety of that age 
was a surface piety enforced by social convention. Churchgoers, by and 
large, were stuck in the same malaise and just as alienated as those who had 
left the church. Why? Because Christians are like samurai.
 
One of Greg’s professors once told him in seminar, “You can’t be a samurai 
warrior.” Poor Greg was devastated. But the professor was right. Some choices 
aren’t available to you. You could do what Forest Whitaker does in the excel-
lent movie Ghost Dog: You could pick up a sword, you could pledge yourself to 
another person, and you could try to follow a code of honor. But being a sam-
urai is something more. Being a samurai means being part of something larger 
than yourself; it means being something with a certain cultural significance. 
Being a samurai is part of the meaning-narrative of an entire society.
Can people be Christians today? Certainly, but they can never be Christians 
in the way people were Christians for hundreds of years during which the 
church dominated European political, intellectual, and cultural institutions. 
Christianity, as an absolute system providing a homogenous meaning narra-
tive for an entire society, is dead. Being a Christian in a world in which the 
sun revolves around the earth, echoing in a concrete, physical way God’s 
love and attention, is gone. Being a Christian in a world in which the teach-
ings of the church are reflected in every physical fact, in every element of 
societal structure, is gone. Even if you believe in God and believe in the divin-
ity of Jesus, that type of Christian is as dead as the samurai.
For the Christian existentialists, to some extent this is a good thing. The price 
of the church’s absolute reassurance was the abdication of your individual, 
personal responsibility for and passionate engagement in your own faith. 
This, for the existentialist, is tantamount to giving up your humanity (dare we 
say your soul?) — a devil’s bargain, to be sure.

40
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
 
After the church loses this privileged, absolute status, the individual must 
reassert himself. Christianity — real, personal, passionate Christianity — once 
again becomes dangerous and once again becomes possible. But it isn’t some-
thing that can be taken for granted. It’s hard. Because Christianity as a domi-
nant system has lost its mojo, lost its ascendancy, God is as dead for the 
Christian as he is for the atheist. And this is attended with all the same pitfalls 
and turmoil.
Science Becomes Its Own Religion
Science, any good scientist will tell you, is skeptical. Its theories are always 
up for revision, correction, and even wholesale replacement. The scientist 
can’t afford to be dogmatic but must always be open-minded. He’s skeptical 
of new theories, but if they survive the rigors of scientific examination, he 
must accept them, no matter how they conflict with his preconceived notions, 
or even with established theories. Science, then, is not an absolute system 
with all the answers. It’s simply a method — a collection of best practices, 
if you will. It’s a method of searching for the truth, to which it’s a humble 
servant.
Yeah, right. If you believe all this, we have a bridge to sell you. If science 
didn’t kill God outright, it certainly agreed to gleefully help hammer the nails 
into the coffin. The traditional line of thinking about the relationship between 
religion and science (as told by scientists) is that science was the victim of 
the narrow-mindedness of the church. Scientists, according to this narrative, 
didn’t have it out for religion; they simply wanted the freedom to explore and 
gain understanding. Why should the church feel so threatened? They said 
that they, unlike the church, were open-minded and simply wanted to use the 
brains God gave them to discover the truths of his creation.
There is some truth to this egalitarian view of science (just as there is some 
falsehood to the vilification of religion in the above narrative). But some sci-
entists have always been willing to openly repudiate the notion of God as 
antithetical to a reasoned understanding of that universe. Recently, there’s 
been a resurgence of this type of thinking. Books like The God Delusion, by 
biologist Richard Dawkins, express the notion that God is a failed hypothesis, 
a belief not just unprovable, but also irrational and foolish. It is, one might 
say, a heretical notion that must be stamped out.

The scientific worldview: Science as God
Science is always incomplete. It’s always searching for truths it hasn’t yet dis-
covered. Science hasn’t progressed, and probably never will progress, to the 
point where it can claim status as the ultimate system of knowledge by virtue 
of having all the answers. Instead, when science makes its claim of being the 
ultimate system for discovering the truths of the universe, it runs on its track 
record. It has a consistent record of demonstrating its ability to explain and 
predict more things than any other system — whether shamanism, astrology, 
religion, or armchair philosophizing.
What produces these results isn’t the big brains of scientists or inclusion in 
their secret club. No, the success of science is credited to the scientific 
method — with the way in which scientists go about seeking the truth. 
Following this method has led people out of the darkness of ignorance and 
superstition and into the light of knowledge. Exactly what this scientific 
method is, is a question open to more debate than you may think. But here 
are some of its major attributes:
 
 Objective rationality: The scientist must be objective, dispassionate, 
and able to look at the subject matter without prejudice. That’s fine for 
studying sturgeon, the existentialist replies, but you can’t study human 
life this way. Come to think of it, you probably can’t study sturgeon this 
way. Human beings simply are never disinterested observers.
 
 Observation and experimentation: This is the classic picture of the sci-
entific method: Scientists make some observations, come up with a 
theory, and test that theory against the world, experimenting and 
making new observations. Although certainly important, it turns out this 
is less important, and less definitive of the activity of science, than we — 
and probably you — were taught in high school science class.
 
 Explanatory power: Now we’re getting to the real power behind the 
throne. When you’re comparing two theories, the stronger one is the 
theory that can explain more. Why take a theory that can explain human 
behavior when a competing theory explains all primate behavior?
 
 Simplicity and elegance: This is the other central pillar of scientific 
method. Scientists prefer less-complex theories over more-complex ones. 
They prefer their hypotheses to refer to as few entities as possible. Take 
the search for a grand unified theory, for example. Physics currently 
posits four forces in the universe: strong, weak, electromagnetic, and 
gravitational (don’t sweat it; it won’t be on the test, we promise!). 
Scientists are currently trying to find a way to show that all four forces 
are really the action of just one underlying force. Why? Because the obser-
vations demand it? Because they can’t explain some phenomenon with 
these four forces? No, just because it’s more simple and more elegant that 
way. This elegance has an aesthetic quality that scientists believe is valu-
able in a theory. So much for objective, dispassionate rationality.

42
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
All this is all well and good, and the existentialists don’t doubt the accom-
plishments of thinkers like Newton. Science is certainly very effective in what 
it does. The problem occurs when a method for studying and learning about 
the facts of the world becomes the perspective from which you perceive and 
interpret the world.
For the existentialists, any set of facts is open to multiple interpretations, 
multiple meanings, and multiple valuations, depending on how you see the 
significance of those facts. But as science became the dominant world view, 
it started to assert the existence of only one interpretation, only one perspec-
tive: the objective, dispassionate perspective of science. Because all other 
worldviews have proved less effective in navigating truth and falsehood and 
in explaining objects and events in the universe, any other way of looking at 
the world amounts to a dangerous and retrograde superstition. At this point, 
science becomes more than just a useful tool for understanding the world; it 
becomes an absolute system proscribing our relationship to it.
 
Like any other absolute system, then, science assumes the mantle of final arbi-
ter of all reality and truth. “We may not have all the answers,” says the scien-
tist, “but we possess the only valid method of getting them.” At this point, 
science ceases to be a humble collection of best practices and becomes its 
own God — a new kind of ultimate, absolute system. This system doesn’t pro-
vide all the answers, but it proscribes the method of searching for those 
answers. Certainly, this is only one way of looking at science, even among sci-
entists. It is a perspective that was particularly ascendant at the time the exis-
tentialists were writing, however, and one that has hardly disappeared even 
today.
Science can’t replace God after all
 
You may think that Nietzsche, as an avid opponent of the church, would 
have been thrilled with the ascendancy of science. But here’s Nietzsche’s 
description of the scientific point of view, “[God is] an idea no longer of any 
use . . . an idea grown useless, superfluous, consequently a refuted idea: let us 
abolish it! (Broad daylight; breakfast; return of cheerfulness and bons sens 
[good sense] . . . )”
Nietzsche isn’t being sympathetic here; he’s being sarcastic, even mocking. 
The idea that simply by ridding the world of superstition, you bring about a 
new, more enlightened age is ludicrous. Science simply isn’t equipped to 
replace religion. As a purely objective inquiry into how things tick, it isn’t set 
up to answer fundamental questions of what it means that things tick and 
whether or why it matters.

43
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
But science doesn’t just fail to replace religion and speak to these essential 
human concerns. It also actually hampers your ability to address these con-
cerns. It stands in the way because of two more characteristics of the scien-
tific method (or perhaps we should say the scientific mindset):
 
 The Donald Trump Effect: As science continually finds more and more 
answers, it seeks new worlds to conquer. Overly wary of the evils of 
superstition and irrationality, it takes for itself more and more real 
estate, claiming more and more realms of the human experience and its 
proper subject.
 
 The See No Evil/Hear No Evil/Speak No Evil Effect: Having acquired all 
this real estate, science then kicks out anything that doesn’t fit into the 
scientific worldview, anything not amenable to purely objective, rational 
scientific inquiry. But rather than kick it back to philosophy or religion, 
it debases it as mere superstition or retrograde thinking. In other words, 
if the scientists can’t study it, no one can. If it doesn’t exist as a valid 
object of scientific inquiry, it doesn’t exist as a valid object of human 
inquiry and concern. Meaning? Value? They don’t see it, can’t hear it, 
and won’t speak of it. If you find a way to fit it into a bar graph, let ’em 
know, and they’ll take over from there.
Science, then, becomes another source of alienation. It not only refuses to 
speak to your most fundamental concerns, but also degrades and debases 
them, much as traditional philosophical and religious systems debased the 
earth.
So What Have You Lost If God Is Dead?
 
Existentialism is an ultimately optimistic philosophy that develops way 
beyond the death of God. Ultimately, the death of God is seen as a good thing. 
It allows you to move beyond the narratives that have sustained you to a 
healthier, more authentic existence. Ultimately. In the shorter term, the exis-
tentialists recognize this as a traumatic and somber event. The most obvious 
metaphor is funereal, seeing all humanity, existentialists included, as being in 
the process of mourning. This is certainly apt. The way some thinkers (partic-
ularly the French) talk about it, another apt metaphor comes to mind: that of 
the scorned lover. Although the existentialists don’t believe in an ultimate jus-
tice, their colorful descriptions of the human situation often use the language 
of abandonment, betrayal, and the loss of something that was in some sense 
theirs. And now they’re pining away for what they lost. You might take a 
moment — as part of the grieving process — to join them in considering what 
you’ve lost. Afterward, you can process your grief and listen to your friends 
console you, saying, “It’s okay, you’re strong, and you’re better off without him.”

44
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
No easy answers: Rejecting all absolutes
God and all the explanatory meaning-narratives he represents gave people 
answers. People like being told what to do, where to stand, where they fit, 
and what their function is. It’s comforting, and it allows them to relax men-
tally and spiritually. The death of God means you’ve lost all absolute answers, 
all ultimately real and right answers to the fundamental questions of exis-
tence. This leaves you feeling like the ground has been removed from under 
your feet. Like a child whose training wheels are taken off without warning 
and feels the bicycle start to shake and wobble uncontrollably, you may be 
disconcerted and understandably scared.
You’re like the child on the bicycle; it then falls to you to take control. When 
your traditional narratives fail you, you inherit a heavy burden. Perhaps no 
one felt this burden like Sartre. Answering charges from his critics that exis-
tentialism leaves human beings in an arbitrary universe in which the existen-
tialist makes up morality without any ultimate, objective support, he replied 
that he didn’t ask for it to be that way and that he was as vexed by the situa-
tion as his critics were. He said that’s where humanity is, however, and you 
have to move forward. The only way forward is for human beings to shoulder 
the responsibility of providing answers for themselves. These won’t be abso-
lute, final answers, but they’re the only answers you can get. You’ll have to 
get into the habit of creating and re-creating them.
The baby with the bathwater: 
Meaning, truth, and value
One of the characteristics of many of the systems and meaning narratives 
that have always sustained people is that they placed meaning elsewhere. 
(See the earlier section on Plato.) One of the reasons it seems so difficult to 
produce meaning for yourself is that you’ve always been told you can’t — 
that there’s no meaning to be found here. If all value resides in, or is under-
written by, God and heaven, by forces and truths beyond the earthly realm, 
when you lose your sustaining faith in those otherworldly holders of value, 
you lose all the things they were holding as their exclusive provenance.
This is one of the reasons atheistic existentialists have been so at odds with 
the church. The church keeps raising eyes to heaven, and the existentialists 
keep lowering eyes back down. And they do bring your eyes way down. Their 
stories are often about ugly realities and scandalous people. They don’t force 
you to look at these things because they want to wallow in misery or debase-
ment. Rather, they want you to recognize that any meaning, value, truth, or 
beauty can be found only here, in this imperfect and often ugly world. They 

45
 Chapter 3: If God Is Dead, Is Life Meaningless?
want you to look at it honestly, without varnish, without covering up its ills, 
without romanticizing it, and without the filter of an ultimate moral judgment 
upon it. They say you must learn to see it this way because your task is to 
find a way to accept and live in this imperfect place — the earth and the 
human world you’re part of. You must recognize that this is the only home 
you have or will ever know.
The danger of nihilism
Strictly speaking, nihilism isn’t something you’ve lost, but it may represent 
something you stand to lose. When something traumatic happens, when you 
lose someone for whatever reason, when you face a crisis that demands that 
you rise to the occasion, the danger always exists that you’ll break, that 
you’ll fall into hopeless despair. For the existentialists, this was the danger 
posed by the collapse of the traditional systems of value and belief that pro-
vided meaning to people for thousands of years.
 
Nihilism is the state of belief in nothing. It’s the belief that nothing matters, but 
perhaps saying that it’s the empty feeling that nothing matters is just as apt. 
Nihilism is a form of surrender or a form of despair; it’s a wallowing in nothing-
ness that the nihilist can’t see beyond. Bob Dylan wrote, “When you ain’t got 
nothin’, you got nothin’ to lose.” There’s something positive and hopeful in this 
statement. Someone with nothing has the freedom to. . . . It’s a freedom alive 
with possibility. The nihilist refuses to see this possibility. For the nihilist, 
when you ain’t got nothin’, you got nothin’ to win. The nihilist rejects all cre-
ation and all positive projects. Like a broken record, the nihilist drones on and 
on, “There is nothing; there can be only nothing.” Rejecting creation, the nihil-
ist often embraces destruction. For the French, this nihilism was an underlying 
cause of the atrocities of the Nazis. Nihilism, then, isn’t just some academic 
concern. It’s the concern that humanity will be eaten by its own fears and anxi-
eties and lapse into, at best, a state of stagnation and immobility and, at worst, 
rush headlong into a cycle of violence, murder, and self-destruction.
 
The existentialists were not nihilists. Their philosophy tries to find a way out 
of nihilism. For the existentialists, life is about creation, about creating the 
ground for your own meaning, creating value and making your world, and 
making yourself into something. It won’t be easy, but they insist that although 
you start with nothing and must continually face the nothingness of the uni-
verse, you don’t have to remain immobile there. You can assume the role of 
being the author of your own existence. Human beings care about and value 
things. The fact that there’s no ultimate significance to things beyond their 
human significance doesn’t mean that they have no significance. The ultimate 
answer to the question asked in the title of this chapter is an insistent, even 
defiant no. If God is dead, the existentialist proclaims, life is not meaningless. It 
has the meaning you choose to give it.

Anxiety, Dread, and Angst

In This Chapter
 Analyzing the importance of feelings in existentialism
 Understanding how your mood helps you reach insights about life
 Investigating the key existential mood: Anxiety
T
he existentialists think that giving your emotions and feelings a place is 
important when you’re grappling with the question of the meaning of life 
or of existence. For existentialists, trying to be too detached and rational 
when you ask such questions just won’t do. Their reason makes sense: 
Human existence is defined by an active participation with things, by a way 
of coming at life.
As far as the existentialists see it, the more involved and engaged existence 
is, the more emotion seems to play an essential part in understanding it. 
Reason can be a good way to analyze things, but it promotes an understand-
ing of things from the outside, from an observer’s point of view. As a result, 
using reason means being detached from the things you’re thinking about. 
Because people aren’t detached from existence, favoring reason as the way 
to understand life is self-defeating.
As a result, existentialists think that trying to understand your life or exis-
tence requires incorporating a way of approaching it from the inside or 
through the very ways that people participate in existence itself. One way to 
do this, they think, is to pay close attention to moods. Existentialists think 
that moods play a primary role in providing insight into the ways your exis-
tence is structured. They emerge from your participation with life and so 
reveal how your existence is inherently participatory, and if you analyze 
them closely, they show you the basic components of that participation.

48
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Although some moods disclose to you how you’re participating right now in 
the world, the existentialists are also interested in the moods that have the 
unique ability to reveal deeper truths about yourself and your existential situ-
ation. Specifically, existentialists are interested in the mood of anxiety. They 
believe that anxiety reveals that people are individual, that a kind of nothing-
ness lies at the heart of themselves and the world, and that they’re ultimately 
free as a consequence.
These existential insights brought by anxiety are unsettling to most people. 
It’s tough to think that nothingness lies at the foundation of what you are, 
and of what the world is, and that as a result you can find no external and 
firm answers about what you should do with your life. As a result, many 
people often try to escape from anxiety by losing themselves within the 
everyday participation with things in the world. They try to flee from what 
anxiety shows them. The existentialists, however, don’t think we should do 
that. We need to grasp onto anxiety. It may make our lives unsettled and inse-
cure, but it also makes our lives free.
Are Emotions Key to Understanding Life?
Everyone asks the big questions at least once or twice in their lives. Maybe 
you ask, “What are the meaning and significance of life?” or “Why am I here?” 
Although asking these questions is common enough, it’s not obvious at all 
how to approach them. Some questions are easy. If you want to know how 
heavy a cup is, you know to put it on a scale. But how do you approach the 
significance of life? After all, no one has a significance meter out there to put 
existence into.
So where do you start? Well, at least one thing is clear. In today’s culture, 
you’re taught that meaningful answers to questions require that the ques-
tioner conduct her investigation from a distanced and unbiased perspective. 
As a result, people have long given preference to faculties like reason and the 
intellect in investigating important questions.
In truth, there’s good reason for that; reason and the intellect do have a cen-
tral place in many inquiries. But let’s face it — this approach seems ill suited 
to the big questions about life. After all, you can’t ever be detached from exis-
tence or from your life to view it from an outsider’s perspective.
 
For the existentialist, living (or existing) is always participatory and involved. 
As a result, existentialism favors analysis that embraces a connection to 
what’s being investigated. To analyze this way, existentialists think it’s impor-
tant to give feelings and emotions, particularly moods, a seat at the table. 
From their point of view, moods and emotions are good vehicles for providing 
insight into what they are as existing beings.

49
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
Emotions: Not traditionally 
valued by philosophers
Existentialism is a particular school of philosophy. Although existentialists 
value emotion, philosophy on the whole has had a complicated and some-
what unfriendly relationship with emotions and feelings over the course of 
2,500 years. This isn’t because philosophers think that humans are Vulcans 
(like Mr. Spock, a member of the emotionless, logical race of humanoids in 
Star Trek). They do recognize that emotions and feelings are a part of what 
you naturally are.
But most philosophers think that emotions and feelings don’t provide you 
with good, accurate knowledge about the sorts of things they investigate. The 
conventional wisdom is that emotions don’t tell you about things; they tell 
you how you feel about those things. Given that all philosophy prides itself 
on its search for truth and knowledge of the various aspects of reality, you’re 
probably not surprised that philosophers are naturally interested in also 
investigating the best methods available for performing that search (its fancy 
name is epistemology). Emotions haven’t fared well in that search!
Valuing the objective
Why did philosophers turn in this direction? Well, if you think about it, what 
seems like a sound way to investigate things if you want to get at the truth 
about something? Clearly, you want to acquire the most accurate description 
of the thing being investigated. And most philosophers think that to do that, 
you need a way of investigating that can be considered objective. Being 
objective traditionally means that a critical examination of a subject
 
 Is entirely unbiased and doesn’t reflect the desires, needs, or interests of 
the questioner in any way.
 
 Is similar to the methodology of science or mathematics.
 
Although philosophy isn’t science, it often tries to mirror the methodology of 
science because it’s believed to be objective. Like science, most philosophy 
aims to carefully locate and analyze data relevant to its inquiry in an unbiased 
and detached way. It then seeks to use reason and the intellect to analyze this 
data. Many people believe that objective conclusions about the subject matter 
can be reached in this way.
Discounting the subjective
The central belief, one that has reigned in philosophy for thousands of years, 
is that using reason and the intellect allows the inquirer to perform investiga-
tions in a way that rises above prejudice and bias. Philosophers think that 
reason and the intellect can grasp the object being considered and look at it 
in a logical way that allows for detached observation.

50
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
From this point of view, feelings or emotions just don’t stack up very well as 
tools to use in critical investigations. When you allow feelings to enter into 
the picture, your investigation takes on a subjective coloring; the inquiry is 
inevitably affected by your personal biases because your feelings reflect your 
own needs and interests.
If that’s right, it’s thought that you wind up with a skewed investigation and 
an inaccurate description of things if you involve emotions or feelings. As a 
result, most philosophers would agree with the common claim that feelings 
can cause you to get too wrapped up in the situation to see things clearly.
For the most part (with a few notable exceptions), when philosophy recog-
nizes feelings and emotions as having an important place in life, they’re 
always subordinated to reason. For example, philosophers agree that of 
course it’s silly to think that you shouldn’t feel in certain ways in certain situ-
ations (because you’re not a Vulcan, after all), but they always suggest that 
reason should guide how you understand things, the way in which you 
express those feelings, or how the feelings motivate and influence action. 
Most philosophers think that reason should always have the upper hand 
because it — and not the feelings themselves — provides insight into the 
truth about the world and about life.
Plato’s charioteer of reason
Plato (427?–347? BC) was one of the first phi-
losophers; he lived in ancient Greece and was 
a great admirer of Socrates. In his dialogue 
Phaedrus (written around 370 BC), Plato pres-
ents his analogy of a chariot for understand-
ing the structure of the human soul. According 
to Plato, the soul has three parts. First is the 
charioteer, who plays the role of reason. The 
charioteer is guiding two horses, one white and 
one black. The white horse is spirit or drive. It 
doesn’t cause the charioteer any trouble. The 
black horse, however, is unruly, and the chario-
teer needs to continually pull it back toward the 
proper direction. The black horse represents the 
irrational passions and feelings. Left unguided, 
the black horse will take off in any number of 
directions, depending on how it’s affected by 
the different situations it encounters. Clearly, 
this undisciplined behavior on the part of the 
emotions disrupts the chariot as a whole (which 
represents you, in the task of living!). The job of 
reason (the charioteer) is to guide the passions 
in the right way, in accord with truth and the 
good — things that only reason itself can know 
about.

51
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
Emotion: A source of insight 
in existentialism
Existentialism is at odds with most philosophy because it favors the use of 
emotions and feelings as vehicles for disclosing important insights into the 
nature of life. Existentialists start by claiming that people are always deeply 
immersed within life. As a result, trying to detach yourself from life to investi-
gate it from a disengaged point of view is futile. Instead, a proper investiga-
tion of life or existence requires methods that acknowledge the participatory 
nature of that existence. A proper investigation strives to inspect existence 
while engaged within it. The central way to do this is to turn to feelings and 
emotions, specifically moods.
Detachment versus attachment: Lying around versus participating
 
Philosophers traditionally think that the best investigation of a subject is an 
objective and unbiased one. This view, however, requires that you adopt a 
very particular understanding of the relationship between the knower and the 
known. Think about it: To know something objectively requires you to be 
detached from that thing. So knowing objectively presumes that you’re inde-
pendent and separate from the thing you’re investigating.
Detachment may be the way to go for some kinds of investigations. But the 
existentialists are deeply concerned with the meaning of your existence or 
with the significance of your life in general. Is life something that you can sep-
arate yourself from and view from an independent perspective? If the answer 
is no, you may want to reject a detached form of analysis as inappropriate for 
inquiring into the meaning of life. Instead, you may want to think about ways 
of gaining insights that embrace attachment and connection, as opposed to 
distance and detachment.
Existentialists vehemently deny the possibility of investigating life in a 
detached manner. So you should always remember that they strongly believe 
that humans are deeply immersed within life. To the existentialist, being 
immersed in life, or existing in the sense that you’re interested in investigat-
ing, means participation.
 
If that’s right, the existentialist seems to be arguing that things can exist in two 
different ways and that you can examine those types of things in two different 
ways. The existence you’re concerned with when you ask, “What’s the mean-
ing of life?” isn’t the kind of existence that you attribute to tables and chairs. 
The two kinds of existence are
 
 Participatory: Existential existence
 
 Detached: Lying-around existence

52
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Tables and chairs aren’t engaged with existence. Their existence is passive; 
they just lie about. When you say that a table exists, what you really mean is 
that it’s there and so takes up space. Your own existence, or life, doesn’t just 
lie about like a thing does (if you’re interested in understanding more about 
these different ways of existing, check out Chapters 6 and 7).
As a result, when you ask about the meaning of life or existence, you surely 
don’t mean “What does it mean to take up space?” Instead, you’re asking a 
very different question. Really, you’re asking about the nature of active, par-
ticipatory existence. You want to know “What’s the significance of my way of 
existing, which is different from the existence of a chair?” You have no way to 
detach from your own participation with existence, so you should approach 
and understand your existence through an analysis of how living itself hap-
pens or what it’s like to be a participator.
Feeling emotions means being involved
Because you can’t detach yourself from your existence, you need to find a 
way to tap into the deep involvement that’s characteristic of your participa-
tory way of existing. By tapping into that engagement and involvement, per-
haps you can disclose worthwhile insights into the questions about life’s 
significance. From the existential perspective, feelings or emotions or moods 
are the most natural candidates for tapping into the existential involvement 
that’s characteristic of your way of existing.
Try this yourself: Thinking about life
The existentialists think that you can’t abstract 
yourself out of your life in a way that allows you 
to look at life and analyze it as though you’re a 
kind of spectator. Instead, they think that life is 
inherently participatory and so can be under-
stood only through the actual process of living 
itself. Is this right? Try to think about your life. 
Typically, what you wind up doing is thinking 
about aspects of your life. You think of your 
job or about your family. But pull back farther. 
Try to think about life itself, so that you can try 
to see how, or in what way, it has meaning or 
significance. Can you do it? It seems as though 
no matter what you wind up thinking about, 
and no matter how abstract your thinking gets, 
you’re still in the process of living as you do it. 
You never jump out of life and get the ability to 
say, “Aha! That’s what it looks like!” This is the 
main point: Thinking about life is itself a way of 
engaging with life. There’s no way out of this 
box! You’re never able to get out of your own 
living to think about life like a disinterested 
spectator.

53
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
Why feelings and emotions and moods? Well, no other faculties are more 
directly immersed in life. The ways you’re affected by things, or the ways 
your attitudes tend to dominate, structure the ways you participate with life. 
Feelings can be visceral. They seem to provide a nitty-gritty commentary on 
how people participate in the project of living, even if the insights they pro-
vide aren’t necessarily intellectual.
In championing this approach to gaining awareness of insights about the 
human condition, some existentialists stress positive emotions such as joy 
and love. Others, perhaps more famously, tend to emphasize the insights 
that can be gleaned from looking at what at least appear to be the more nega-
tive or darker (though they need not be seen in that way) emotions, such as 
nausea, anxiety, boredom, and alienation.
 
Existentialists favor the use of emotion as a tool for gaining insight into exis-
tence, but they don’t reject reason as a powerful source of knowledge. They 
aren’t irrationalists. They don’t reject reason. Instead, they believe that if you 
use only the intellect when you investigate big questions concerning life, you 
limit what you’ll find. Seems reasonable, doesn’t it?
Ethics: Reason or feeling?
A cultural bias in today’s society indicates that 
if you want to come to a right and accurate 
solution to an ethical situation, you’re required 
to detach yourself from the situation and think 
about its relevant variables by using reason or 
the intellect. This approach was directly cham-
pioned by Immanuel Kant (in a work written in 
1790). He believed that reason alone, and not 
feeling, could allow a person to access moral 
truth. In modern society, this bias toward moral 
detachment has even led to odd gender biases 
about ethical capacity. Because women are 
typically seen as being more naturally emo-
tional, it is held that they have a hard time 
removing themselves from what are taken to be 
irrelevant emotional variables in an ethical situ-
ation. As a result, it’s believed that their way of 
approaching ethics is less advanced because 
their emotional analyses leave them with inac-
curate and suspect conclusions. Men, who are 
thought to employ reason more naturally, and 
therefore would be more likely to detach from 
the analysis of the situation at hand, are thought 
to be more likely to reach accurate ethical con-
clusions. You’re probably not surprised that

Recognizing the Insights 
That Moods Provide
Existentialists tend to favor the analysis of mood in approaching the big 
questions about the meaning of life or in trying to understand at a deeper 
level what it means to say that a person, as an individual, exists.
One primary point that they make is that attention to your moods reveals 
that your existence is special and that it is best understood in terms of how 
you exist, as opposed to what your existence looks like. When you turn to 
these “how” questions, you discover through moods that you’re always 
deeply immersed within the world in a way. Specifically, you’re always emo-
tionally tuned into your unique life situations in particular ways. In existing, 
the world of everyday objects and other people is revealed as not only intrin-
sically connected, but also inescapably flavored and disclosed in specific 
ways that correspond to the mood you’re in.
Existentialists also believe that some moods are more primordial or basic to 
existence than others:
 
 Everyday moods: These moods reveal more about your specific rela-
tionships with beings in the world or with the things that populate the 
everyday aspects of life.
 
 Existential moods: These other kinds of moods bypass the everyday 
and disclose insights about the very structure of existence itself, or 
about how you’re related to being in the world in general, as opposed to 
how you’re related to specific things within the world itself.
As you see toward the end of this chapter, the existential moods, such as 
anxiety, are most important to the existentialists. When you face up to what 
anxiety shows you about how you exist, you’re given the sorts of insights 
that you need to truly take charge of your life and become truly free.
Your moods disclose how you exist
When you bump into a person you know, it’s considered polite to ask her 
“How are you doing?” or “How is it going?” From an existential perspective, 
these questions are inquiring about a very basic kind of awareness or under-
standing that all people have about the character of their own existence. 
These insights are revealed through moods.
When you hear the word existence thrown around, ask, “What kind of exis-
tence?” If the word is being used to refer to detached existence, the kind that 
applies to objects, you know that the inquiry will typically turn toward a 

55
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
description of the kinds of properties a thing can have when someone looks 
at it from the third-person, scientific point of view.
Think of a baseball. It has a detached existence. So when you wonder about 
its existence, you say that it’s characterized by properties such as “being 
round” and “having a certain mass.” It’s detached because having those prop-
erties doesn’t require any kind of inward activity on the part of the thing. The 
ball can just passively lie there and have those features. Because of this, you 
can tell what kind of properties characterize an object’s existence by just 
looking at it from a distanced or spectator’s perspective.
 
You, on the other hand, have a participatory existence, the kind that applies 
to being a subject. One way to grasp participatory existence is to think of a 
kind of existence that’s specific to the inside looking out. To get a feel for what 
this means, look around. Sense the activity of living or existing — the sensa-
tion of actually engaging with the world that’s present at every moment of 
your life. You don’t have to be doing anything special. You can just be sitting 
there. But it’s clear that from the inside, some kind of engagement is going on; 
it’s a kind of existence that’s different from that of the ball.
The engagement you sense is the basic dimension (not exhaustive, though) 
of participatory existence. If you want to know what participatory existence 
is like or what it’s all about, descriptions such as “round” or “red” or “heavy” 
don’t seem appropriate at all.
But you aren’t like the baseball or any other kind of object; you can’t talk 
about the kind of participatory existence subjects have by looking at them as 
though they’re objects outside you. On the contrary, you can’t describe how 
a subject exists without being a subject yourself. As the old saying goes, it 
takes one to know one. The reason is obvious: Understanding this kind of 
existence can’t be separated from actually living in that way.
 
When a friend asks you how it’s going, she’s asking about participatory exis-
tence. She wants to know how you’re existing right now; she wants you to 
characterize or describe how your participatory existence is going right now. 
Of course, most people don’t consciously know that this is what they’re 
asking. But because the questioner is a subject herself, she has a kind of 
implicit awareness of what she’s asking about. It’s the sort of thing that goes 
without saying. When you answer, she knows what you mean in a way that 
goes beyond words.
So what kind of answer should you give? Well, think about it: What kind of 
answers do you typically give? According to existentialists such as Martin 
Heidegger, people respond by talking about their moods. Instead of saying, 
“I’m participating roundly lately” or “I’m very circular today,” you say things 
like “I’m sad” or “I’m pretty ecstatic!”

56
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Mood descriptions fit only subjects and the specific participatory existence 
they embody. Saying that you’re “in a round way today” would seem odd — 
just as odd as saying that a baseball is sad. Objects and subjects each have a 
kind of existence particular to them and a specific set of descriptions that 
goes along with that type of existing.
When you respond to a question about how you are, you’re essentially telling 
the other person how you find yourself at that time. In fact, Heidegger has a 
German term for this; he calls it befindlichkeit. When you ask a person “What’s 
up?” that’s what you’re asking — “How do you find yourself to exist right 
now?” You’re saying, “Freeze-frame for a second and sense your existence. 
Okay, what’s it like right now?”
Moods are the flavors of life
Existentialists favor the use of moods to give you insight into your own 
basic way of existing. But what exactly do moods tell you? According to the 
existentialists, when you think about mood, it turns out that it shows you 
that the way you exist as a subject has a complicated, though necessary, 
structure.
Specifically, moods tell you that:
 
 You always exist somewhere, and you don’t have much control over the 
fact that your way of existing is always situated.
 
 Where you’re situated matters to you or is significant to you. So you 
always take positions on it by being affected by the somewhere you exist.
 
 The position you take reveals the way in which you are where you are. It 
reveals the flavor or taste of your existence in that situation.
Your existence is always situated, whether you like it or not
This point highlights a central existential truth about the nature of life: You 
can’t exist in a way that’s separate from the concrete situations that you find 
yourself in. That’s part of what you are; you’re always engaging some worldly 
situation or other. Moods reveal this situation to you because they seem to 
point you to where you are. In a way, a mood is like a way of being connected 
to the specific world you find yourself in at a given time. When you’re sad, 
this world is what’s sad. When you’re bored, this world is what’s shown to be 
boring. The fact that you’re always situated within a particular world isn’t 
something you can change; it’s a fundamental part of what you are.
Where you are matters to you, so you always take positions on 
where you are by being affected by the somewhere you exist
If this point is right, existing — or living — as a subject means always being 
open to the situations you’re in. You’re open to those situations because they 

57
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
always matter to you. Existing means being deeply involved in the situations 
you find yourself in. Unlike Switzerland, you’re never neutral toward your 
world. You’re always touched by it. This isn’t surprising; those situations 
aren’t separate from you but are a part of your very existence. This close 
connection, the existentialists suggest, marks the fact that your way of exist-
ing doesn’t include just being somewhere or in some situation, but also 
means being disposed toward that situation in some way.
 
Your way of being disposed toward the world is characterized by the mood 
you’re in. Because you’re always somewhere, and because awareness of that 
somewhere comes through your mood, Heidegger suggests that you “are 
never free of moods.” It’s true, isn’t it? You may be calm, annoyed, pensive, or 
sad, but you’re always in some mood or other!
 
If the existentialists are right, that makes sense. Imagine that you and the situ-
ations you encounter in life are connected through an interface, and that inter-
face is mood. Existing just means being oriented toward those situations 
through some interface or other. Seen in this way, moods can’t be seen as 
something merely in you or as simply outside you. Instead, they’re the medium 
through which you’re connected to the world itself. Existing, as a result, 
always has a certain type of flavor. If you didn’t have a mood, you wouldn’t 
exist, because not having a mood would mean not being somewhere — but 
you can’t do that!
The position you take reveals the way in which you are where you are
The last point follows the first two. If existing means being somewhere, and if 
being somewhere means that you’re interfaced with that situation in a partic-
ular way, you’re affected by the situation in a way that’s colored or flavored 
by that mood. Basically, you’re always affected. It’s what you are. In a way, 
Descartes, who said, “I think, therefore I am,” got it wrong — it’s really “I’m 
moody, therefore I am!”
Being affected also means that your orientation toward your life gets orga-
nized in a certain way. If the world appears sad, something (you) is down. 
Mood reveals your way of being engaged with the situations that you can’t 
escape from. This is important, because moods tend to structure the ways in 
which you think about interacting with that world. When you’re down, only 
certain possibilities in a situation appear real to you. When you’re ecstatic, a 
different set of possibilities appears to be real. If part of existing is interacting 
with what’s possible, moods seem to play a central role!
 
These significant points show that your way of existing presupposes an ines-
capable connection to a world that you’re always within. This point is a pretty 
serious one when you consider that some people think that humans can exist 
apart from the world! In addition, it suggests that your most basic way of being 
connected to the world comes from a kind of emotional or mood-based attach-
ment, not through reason or intellect. Last, it shows that you, as an existing 
being, are always in a mode of active participation with the world around you.

58
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
You’re always tuned in to the world
Existentialists point out that mood is an essential and basic aspect of your 
way of existing. If you attend to your moods, you always find yourself dis-
posed toward the world in one sense or another. If you look closer, however, 
you find that because the world feels a certain way to you, the objects within 
it tend to look a certain way to you. As a result, mood tunes you in to a spe-
cific world.
Heidegger insists that in pretty much every moment of your life, you’re in (or 
not in) the mood for this (or that). Sometimes mood leads you to be open or 
closed off to doing certain things because they structure what seems possi-
ble to you in that situation. Of course, the most clichéd example is sex; some-
times you’re just not in the mood. As a result, certain ways of approaching 
situations with a spouse or lover simply don’t occur to you at that time. 
Sometimes you’re in the mood; then things look and feel different. From an 
existential point of view, what does this mean, though?
It says that the way in which things in the world appear to you has a feel. 
Things in the world aren’t just “blue” or “heavy” or “textured.” They’re also 
“fearsome” or “engaging” or “interesting” or “funny” or “sexy.” It’s important 
to realize, though, that you aren’t projecting these moods onto the world. It’s 
not as though the world is moodless, and then you come along and color the 
world with your moods. The fact that you find yourself in the world, or in this 
situation or that, already includes moods. Sometimes, in fact, certain moods 
descend upon you, often against your will!
 
Moods are the flavor of your existence. Think again about being in the mood 
for sex. Bodies look appealing. They look desirable. When you’re not in the 
mood, those same bodies look different. They look unappealing, or at least 
boring or uninteresting. Or think about being in a sad mood. When you’re sad, 
the world looks like a sad place to live in. When you’re in a sad mood, you 
tend to focus on what appears depressing to you. You turn into a glass-half-
empty type of person. You can’t help it; your way of being, in that moment, 
has this or that feel. The world is sad, and you’re tuned in to it.
 
As we point out earlier in this chapter, it’s a mistake to think that moods are 
in you and that you project them onto a neutral world, or even that a neutral 
world causes you to be in a mood. Instead, as Heidegger puts it, mood 
“comes neither from ‘outside’ nor from ‘inside,’ but arises out of Being in 
the world . . . ”
What Heidegger means is that you don’t first exist in the world and then 
interpret it. Instead, the fact that you exist means that your existence already 
has a mood; it already has a background that’s functioning as the interpreta-
tive background for the situation you’re in.

59
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
All these points come together to highlight the fact that the German word 
stimmung, which means mood, also means tuning. This connection reflects 
nicely what the existentialist is saying. Basically, because existing always 
means being in a specific mood, it also means being tuned in to the things 
within that world in a specific way. Your moods lead you to sense a very par-
ticular world.
Everyday moods and existential moods
Moods provide you with an important way of sensing or feeling your own 
existence. Moods reveal that you’re always actively involved in life and that 
the world in which you live always matters to you; it’s always significant. 
Your mood flavors the way in which it appears as significant. Some moods go 
farther, however; they allow you to sense your existence at a much deeper 
level, penetrating farther into what it means to exist as a subject (as opposed 
to an object). These moods reveal possibly disturbing insights about what 
lies at the core of your specific way of existing in the world as a subject.
When the existentialists talk about moods, always think “What type of 
mood?” The two basic kinds both refer to a different way in which your 
engagement with the world can be flavored. Each of those different ways of 
engaging with the world points to different notions of what it means to be 
connected to the world. There are two basic ways of thinking about how you 
can be connected to the world. Each type of connection comes with moods 
specific to it. Think of your basic connection to the world as having the fol-
lowing two worldly dimensions:
 
 The everyday world: This is the collection of individual things that you 
encounter in normal, everyday routine. The everyday world is com-
posed of objects like chairs, mountains, people, and cars.
 
 The existential world: Instead of the objects in your experience, you’re 
affected by the world of significance taken as a whole. This world is the 
collection of the ways in which the objects of your routine can appear 
meaningful to you.
Be careful — this point is weird and abstract, and confusing these two 
notions of the world is easy. Take the everyday world. When you’re in a 
happy mood, the objects or things within your everyday, routine world are 
colored in terms of happiness. You’ve no doubt experienced this before. 
When you’re in a good mood, you see the silver lining in everything. You 
become a glass-half-full person. To you, the world just is a happy place. You 
see the up side of everything around you. We call these everyday moods 
because they relate to your everyday, worldly experience. Your moods are 
focused on this or that set of things within your normal experience.

60
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
 
Contrast this everyday world with the existential notion of world. To see this 
world, don’t think of what you’re specifically doing right now. Instead, pull 
back and try to understand your engagement with the world in a much more 
general and abstract way. Think about how part of what you are requires 
being engaged with a world in the first place — a world of meaning. So you’re 
not affected by a world of objects, but by systems of meaning.
Try this example: When you’re in everyday moods, the way in which your 
workplace appears to you can be very different. It can be a place full of possi-
bility or of a depressing, fatalistic routine that oppresses you and that you 
hate. But in existential moods, you begin to wonder not what your relation-
ship is to your job, but what your relationship is to the different ways in 
which your job can affect you. In the existential moods, you gain a different 
kind of insight into your existence. You begin to gain insight into the question 
“How am I related to the possible set of meanings that can be used to struc-
ture my world and my experience?”
 
It’s important to see that the existential world gets at a much deeper level of 
your existence. When you penetrate this deep, you’re pretty much at the 
ground floor of your existence. In Heidegger’s language, your moods are no 
longer focused on revealing beings-in-the-world (stuff lying around in your 
everyday world), but on revealing the mysterious phenomenon of being-in-the-
world (what it means to be in the world in the first place).
Just as much as your way of engaging with everyday things in your world can 
be flavored by everyday moods like happiness, fear, sadness, and irritation 
(to name a few), your way of engaging with the existential world is flavored 
by mood. For the existentialists, the primary existential mood that governs 
this relationship is anxiety, which is translated in some existential works as 
angst or dread. Doesn’t sound like an enticing mood, eh? Well, no one ever 
said that revealing insights about the fundamental core of your existence 
shouldn’t be unsettling, at least just a bit!
Anxiety: The Existentialists’ 
Favorite Mood
Anxiety is, by and large, the most important mood for existentialists. Like all 
moods, anxiety plays an important role in disclosing insights about your exis-
tence to you. Everyday moods tell you how you find yourself tossed into and 
immersed within the specific worldly situations you’re always inevitably in. 
On the other hand, existential moods such as anxiety disclose insights about 
you as an existing thing. Anxiety reveals insights about how you’re related to 
the world in a far more basic and fundamental way.

61
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
The fact that your basic existential situation is revealed through anxiety is 
revealing from the start. It implies that when you begin to become aware of 
your nature as an existing being, as opposed to being merely aware of your 
life within the everyday world of your routine, you become unsettled and 
uneasy. Although this is true, existentialists start by emphasizing that 
although anxiety is unsettling, anxiety shouldn’t be confused with fear.
Anxiety shows you the following things about the meaning of your existence 
in a general, big-picture way:
 
 Anxiety affects you by making the everyday world of your routine seem 
insignificant and meaningless. The ways in which the world is given (or 
has been given) meaning and significance have no firm or necessary 
foundation. No possibility before you seems to address you.
 
 Anxiety also shows you that you’re an individual and therefore you 
aren’t defined by the way the world has been given meaning and signifi-
cance by those around you. In fact, the ways in which you’ve under-
stood your own identity in terms of the world aren’t essential to what 
you are. So just as much of the world has no necessary structure or 
meaning, neither do you!
 
 Anxiety discloses your attraction to and repulsion from the insight that 
you’re radically free to give your existence significance in ways of your 
own choosing.
In the upcoming sections, we look at the difference between anxiety and fear. 
From there, we turn to how anxiety shows you that the world, and you your-
self, have no necessary essence or meaning (that both contain a kind of 
nothingness at their core). We then look at how these insights are not only 
disturbing — after all, they seem to leave you without a firm sense of what 
the world and your own self are — but also needed for you to be free.
Distinguishing anxiety from fear
If you’re experiencing anxiety, you know it. You feel very unsettled and 
shaken. Anxiety is a nail-biting mood. But don’t mistake this mood for fear, 
even if it does have some similarities with it. Fear and anxiety are focused on 
very different things.
A person who’s anxious is apprehensive and uneasy. She’s shaken. She feels 
uncomfortable and uncertain. This description sounds like fear, because 
when you’re fearful, you’re afraid of something that threatens you, and in the 
face of that thing, you feel unsettled and shaken. But fear and anxiety are 
actually different:

62
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
 
 Fear is directed at and discloses specific objects in the world; anxiety 
isn’t about anything in the world at all.
 
 Fear can be resolved by attending to the objects that it points to; anxiety 
can’t be resolved in any worldly way at all.
The next two sections explain these differences.
The direction of fear versus anxiety
Fear is always about something (or some things) in the world. Fear relates to 
your apprehension in the face of something that you can experience in your 
everyday life. Anxiety shares some of these characteristics; like fear, it’s 
directed at something, and it makes you apprehensive. But unlike fear, anxi-
ety isn’t directly focused on anything in the world. It’s as though nothing is 
the object of anxiety. The object of anxiety is just everywhere (and nowhere!), 
in a way.
Existentialists have different ways of explaining this. First, they think that 
fear has a worldly target (that dog over there with the big teeth!), whereas 
anxiety has your very existence as a whole as its target. Anxiety seems to be 
focused on the way in which you exist in the world, as opposed to any spe-
cific thing that you may be oriented toward within that world. You might say 
that anxiety has an existential target, and fear has a psychological target.
 
As an existential mood, anxiety reveals and discloses insights about what you 
are as an existing entity. So anxiety reveals insights into what it means to be 
the kind of being who must, to exist, be connected to a world in a participa-
tory way. As a result, because anxiety is focused at your existence on this very 
deep level, it reveals fundamental insights about the way in which you and the 
world are related. So anxiety is aimed at the big picture, and fear is focused on 
smaller things within the picture.
The resolution of fear versus anxiety
If you’re afraid of sharks, it’s a good bet that when you go to the beach, you 
get apprehensive when you go near the water. If you’re afraid of heights, 
you’re terrified when you’re in high places. Well, these things can be easily 
taken care of — avoid the objects that cause you fear! Move to Arkansas if 
you’re afraid of sharks. Live in Kansas on the plains if heights bother you. 
Easy enough. You can actually take steps or reorganize your projects in the 
world in ways that allow you to deal with your fear.
Anxiety is very different. Because it’s not directed at anything in the world, 
nothing about your routine or your worldly projects can affect it or make it 
go away. That doesn’t mean that people don’t try; people who experience 
existential anxiety often mistake its cause for something in the world. Many 

63
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
times people mistake anxiety for fear and try to avoid this or that fearful situ-
ation but find that the sense of being unsettled remains. In fact, the only way 
to deal with anxiety is to face it — and that means grappling, at a fundamen-
tal level, with what it means for you to exist as all. That requires a different 
task from deciding what specifically to do in the world itself.
Existentialists are united in agreeing that people normally don’t confront 
their anxiety when it pops up. After all, anxiety isn’t comfortable; it’s a per-
turbed, apprehensive, unsettled mood. As a result, people often try to dis-
tract themselves with worldly projects to avoid it; they desperately start 
rearranging their world in an attempt to shake themselves from the clutches 
of its mood. However, even if you’re successful temporarily, anxiety is always 
there, waiting for you to reexperience it. This is because anxiety is the funda-
mental mood that corresponds to what you are, to your very nature as an 
existing being.
 
There’s no escape from anxiety; after all, hiding from yourself is like chasing 
your tail! Anxiety will always be there, waiting around the corner for you to 
lower your guard. So perhaps you should face it. After all, within anxiety lie 
key insights into your very being. Why not take a look?
Having anxiety means you’re an 
individual, like it or not
One of the first things that anxiety reveals is that you’re an individual. 
Sounds nice, right? Everyone wants to (or claims to want to) be an individual. 
Unfortunately, when anxiety reveals that insight, it’s a little jarring, because it 
means a bit more than you probably think it does!
 
A long time ago, coauthor Chris had a very serious car wreck. For some 
reason, a heavy bout of existential anxiety followed it. He remembers it like it 
were yesterday. After the wreck, nothing in life, or in the world, seemed to 
have the same level of pizzazz that it had before. All the different reasons for 
going about his regular routine and interacting with this or that plan or proj-
ect seemed equally futile and pointless. All the meanings that structured his 
world seemed foreign.
The world as a whole (instead of just specific things within it) can commonly 
become flavored or colored this way in the mood of anxiety. As Heidegger 
put it, in anxiety, the world of the everyday tends to fade away and leave an 
uncanny and unfamiliar world behind in its place. The things that compose 
the everyday world of your normal life just seem pointless and alien to you.

64
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Like any mood, anxiety discloses the world in a certain way and structures 
your way of interacting with it. Unlike other moods, however, anxiety shows 
you that your typical way of living in the world — in what Kierkegaard called 
immediacy — isn’t true to what you are. When you live in immediacy, you 
forget the question of your existence. You no longer think of yourself as a 
subject who must grapple with the question of how to live your life in a mean-
ingful way.
Instead, in immediacy, you get lost in the everyday, in the world of things and 
the meanings that have been assigned to those things and those projects by 
others. Your life becomes robotic. Anxiety, on the other hand, individuates. It 
shows you that what you are, or your significance, isn’t defined passively by 
the meanings you find in the world — those meanings given by others.
Anxiety does this by ripping you out of your routine and making it hard for 
you to reengage with it. If you’ve ever suddenly thought, “Whoa! Three years 
just went by!” you know the feeling of waking up after almost sleepwalking 
through your life. You get the unmistakable impression that you’ve been 
asleep for years and that you just now woke up to that realization. You were 
sleepwalking in a way, almost living on autopilot.
What’s that like? Well, when you’re on autopilot, you tend to do the things 
that are expected of you in your world. You pay close attention to what the 
world and those in the world tell you that you should do, and you follow 
those plans. You see yourself as a mere reflection of those exterior meanings. 
You don’t really question anything. That’s immediacy, and getting lost in its 
grip is easy because it’s so tranquil and comfortable. Anxiety and immediacy, 
however, are like oil and vinegar. The mood of anxiety shatters immediacy by 
coloring your world in a way that shakes you and yells, “WAKE UP!”
 
Misunderstanding what this insight means is easy to do. The existentialists 
aren’t saying that you aren’t meant to have engagements with the world or 
that you should run off and join a monastery. On the contrary, part of your 
nature is to participate in the world — to have plans and projects. What anxi-
ety discloses to you, however, is that you’re not just an object in the world, 
like a chair or a ball. Objects in the world are like tools. They have significance 
only when it’s assigned to them from the outside.
When you live in immediacy, it’s as though you’ve accepted significance from 
the public or from “them” or from the crowd that dictates the meaning of the 
world that you find yourself immersed within. By allowing the world, and 
your own role as an existing subject, to be defined by “them,” you allow the 
public world to dictate your significance, just like it dictates the significance 
of a tool. When you stop questioning your relationship with life or the world 
as a whole, you stop asking the big questions about life. You start living like a 
tool or an object, a thing that lacks that ability in the first place. The only way 

65
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
to rescue yourself is to grapple once more with those big questions. Anxiety 
puts you in the position to do that by overwhelming you in a mood that 
breaks you out of your immediacy and creates a space for you to once again 
ask those important questions.
Sensing nothingness everywhere
When the existential mood of anxiety strikes, it’s never aimed at anything 
particular in the world. You can’t point to anything as its cause. “Why are 
you anxious?” someone may ask. “Oh, it’s nothing,” you may reply. Oddly 
enough, you’d be right! Anxiety is a mood that senses the nothingness, or 
lack of foundation, at the core of the world and of yourself. One thing is for 
sure: Sensing nothingness isn’t a comforting experience!
What is this nothing? We know what you’re thinking, and no, that’s not a trick 
question. You’re thinking that nothing can’t be something, because then it 
wouldn’t be nothing at all! For the existentialists, however, a kind of nothing-
ness does actually pervade your existence, and only mood can reveal it to 
you. In fact, life is shot through with nothingness from all sides. As Sartre put 
it, “Nothingness is coiled in the heart of Being.” Strange, isn’t it?
The nothing of the world
 
For the existentialists, part of what it means for you to exist is to always find 
yourself participating with the world in some way. You always find yourself 
there, or somewhere, in some situation. And being in a situation means being 
affected in certain ways. You’re always in some mood or other, and as a result, 
the things in the world stand out to you in certain ways.
 
But think about this: Isn’t it true that the way that a specific situation affects 
you, or even the mood that you fall under, is heavily dependent on the specific 
world into which you were born? If you’d been born in ancient Rome, a whole 
host of different ways of participating, interacting, and being affected by life 
would have been open to you. For the existentialists, that doesn’t just mean 
that certain moods are found only in certain time periods or historical circum-
stances, but also that ways in which the world (and yourself) can look to you 
are just as bound to the features of the world in which you live.
To use Heidegger’s terminology, part of what it means to be you is to realize 
that you’re thrown into this situation, into a world that has this past and this 
history and this culture surrounding it. You surely didn’t put yourself there. 
Nonetheless, there you are! And that shows that the ways in which you can 
understand yourself and the world, or the ways in which you can be affected 
by the world, are already given to you as a part of your thrown nature. You’re 
thrown, against your will, into the whole enchilada!

Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
When anxiety separates you from the world by yanking you out of your rou-
tine, it brings this insight into the foreground. You begin to become aware of 
the accidental nature of the system of meanings you’ve been thrown into. 
You realize that you surely didn’t have to be born here. You realize that the 
way you understand and approach things isn’t necessary at all. “Hey, wait a 
minute,” you seem to say to yourself. “I’ve been tricked. This is just a way of 
looking at things, not the way! There are other possibilities for me!”
 
One way to think of it is to say that anxiety reveals to you that the world (the 
whole system of meanings that you’re thrown into) rests on nothing at all. The 
world has no reason to be structured this way, as opposed to some other way. 
Clearly, this isn’t the way the world feels when you aren’t anxious. When 
you’re immersed within the everyday world (trapped within immediacy), or 
when you’re robotically performing your regular routines, the meanings and 
significance of the way that the world is structured seem natural and obvious. 
“How could it be any other way?” you seem to think.
Anxiety reveals that all those systems of meaning are just castles built on 
sand. The meanings and systems of significance that structure your world 
have no real foundation outside themselves. As a result, the way your world 
is put together isn’t necessary. The world, seen in this way, rests on nothing. 
Try this yourself: Anxiety quiz
Think about the relationship you have with your 
own life — with the way in which you tend to 
come at life in a general sense. Answer the fol-
lowing questions about it:
  Have you ever entertained feelings of alien-
ation and separation from the world of your 
routine?
  Do you ever feel as though the whole way 
in which the world is structured — the way 
in which it’s understood as meaningful by 
others — has no foundation?
  Have you ever had a hard time engaging 
with everyday tasks because they all seem 
insignificant and without purpose?
 
  Have you ever felt as though the choices 
you make about how to live are burden-
some because you recognize the impor-
tance of making choices in a way that is not 
robotic, that is not merely reflective of the 
way the people around you structure the 
world and give it meaning?
If you answer yes to many of these questions, 
you’re not alone. You’ve sensed the nothing-
ness at your core and at the core of the world. 
You feel that although the world is your home, it 
doesn’t define you. You sense that you can be 
more than what you presently are, though you 
also recognize that no signs tell you which way 
you should go. You’ve experienced the mood of 
anxiety that underlies the whole of what you are 
as an existing being.

67
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
In fact, there really isn’t even a convincing reason that the world as a whole 
has to exist in the first place! Why not total nothingness instead? In anxiety, 
everything around you just seems completely accidental.
The nothing that is you
It certainly isn’t very comforting to think that the significance of the world, as 
you’ve been thrown into it, isn’t grounded in anything final or ultimately sub-
stantial. Unfortunately, that’s not the worst of it. If it’s true that the meanings 
that make up your world are entirely accidental and groundless, where does 
that leave you as the being who exists in that world?
When anxiety pulls you out of your everyday life and shows you its lack of 
grounding, the mood itself makes it impossible for you to identify or under-
stand yourself in terms of any of the meanings and significance that are given 
by that world. After all, those meanings don’t speak to the you that anxiety 
reveals. They’re just a set of meanings you’ve been thrown into. They apply 
to anyone but to no one individual in particular. In a very real way, you begin 
to sense yourself as different from those meanings in some way.
 
Think about this for a second, because it’s a pretty weird result. Up until the 
moment of anxiety, the only way you understood yourself was in terms of the 
public, ungrounded world of your routine. Perhaps you understand yourself 
as a father or as an American. Both roles come with a whole set of meanings 
and ways of understanding the world and yourself. So if anxiety reveals to you 
that those meanings are groundless, it seems to suggest that they don’t neces-
sarily form the basis for your self-understanding. What you are is independent 
from those meanings in some sense. After you see this, you see that anxiety 
reveals that you (in addition to the world) are nothing as well. Nothing ulti-
mately grounds what your identity is, or what you choose to do in life, or the 
plans or projects you should find important. Face it — without the world’s 
system of pregiven meanings, you don’t at the moment have any way to finally 
define yourself. Anxiety forces you to lose your clothes! It leaves you feeling 
naked and vulnerable! It’s no surprise that’s it’s so unsettling.
So who are you? Anxiety shows you that you really are nothing! You don’t 
have an essence. What a position to be in! The world is groundless and sup-
ported by nothing. Moreover, you have no essence either. In anxiety, you 
seem to have nowhere safe to turn. You’re hemmed in by nothingness on all 
sides.
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why people tend to want to 
avoid anxiety. For most, even getting a glimpse of what anxiety reveals makes 
them freak out. In response, they run, full speed ahead, back into the immedi-
ate world of their routine, into the familiar world in which they can get lost 
again (we talk about this tactic more in Chapter 10). They want to forget what 

68
Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
they’ve seen. They want to return to the prefabricated world of supposedly 
secure meanings that they can just fit themselves back into.
 
To think in terms of the movies, the tendency is to want to be put back into 
the matrix (immediacy, your routine) after Morpheus (the representation of 
anxiety, in this case) has pulled you out. For most people, if they knew what 
Morpheus’s red pill was going to reveal to them, they’d quickly choose the 
blue pill and forget the whole thing! “Put me back into the matrix!” they’d yell 
(if you’ve seen the movie, some characters demand just that!).
Revealing the dizziness of freedom
The existentialists’ claim that anxiety reveals the nothingness at the core of 
you and your world is closely linked to the claim that anxiety discloses to 
you that you’re free.
No one starts off wanting to be nothing. We don’t remember ever starting off 
that way. Heck, who would? Telling someone that she’s nothing is usually an 
insult. At the very least, it’s surely not comforting! Instead, you usually feel a 
strong desire to define yourself in terms of the meanings that the world 
around you provides for you, free of charge. You want to be able to say that 
you are this way or that way. You want to be able to talk as though these 
descriptions (whatever they are) are properties that you have (as a self), the 
way cups have properties like weight and color.
Those properties, you suggest, explain you to yourself and to others by point-
ing out your nature. Understanding yourself passively in terms of the meanings 
given to you explains why you do things. It basically takes the responsibility 
for who you are out of your hands. “That’s just what I am!” you can always say. 
Perhaps you’re a dad. As a result, you argue, you must do certain things, just 
like a cup that falls does so because it has mass. When you talk that way, how-
ever, you take away your freedom. Of course, you can always not do what a 
dad does, or you can redefine what it means to be a dad. The cup can’t do that. 
You drop it, and its mass will hurl it down toward the ground. You’re free to 
redefine yourself. Cups aren’t. Anxiety shows you that you have the power to 
create yourself, because you aren’t essentially any of the roles or meanings 
that your world assigns to you. You are possibility!
Nothingness means freedom
Avoiding the desire to run from anxiety into these false self-portraits of what 
we are, given to us by society, is important to the existentialists. You need to 
come face to face with what you are, and an important aspect of your nature, 
revealed in the insight into your own nothingness, is possibility. If you’re not 
defined by any essence, either within yourself or one given to you by the 

69
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
world, you’re free to direct yourself in any number of ways that are open to 
you by the situation you find yourself in. In short, anxiety provides an insight 
into nothingness that discloses to your nature as possibility, and so your 
freedom is made apparent to you.
 
Part of what you are rests in the fact that you find yourself tossed into a par-
ticular world of meanings. You don’t have much choice over that. It’s also true 
that you aren’t defined by it. Together, a few points follow:
 
 You aren’t free to do anything at all. You weren’t born into ancient 
Rome, so seeing, experiencing, or feeling the world as an ancient Roman 
isn’t something you can do. But your particular past, your history, and 
your situation do in fact open a tremendous number of possibilities for 
you. After you see this fact, you recognize that although you don’t 
decide what system of meanings you’ve been thrown into, it’s up to you 
to figure out how to interpret or rearrange them (we talk more about 
this notion, which Heidegger calls repetition, in Chapter 9).
 
 Basically, it’s up to you to give meanings to the meanings your world 
provides! So your nature, revealed to you by anxiety, comes with a kind 
of responsibility or burden. In every second of your existence, anxiety 
shows you, nothing about the world forces you to choose any path at 
all. You’re always free. That’s the burden of life that you bear and that 
anxiety makes clear to you.
You’re even free from yourself
If you’re always free, you’re also always free from yourself. How can that be, 
though? Think of it this way: All the actions, vows, or ways of interpreting 
things that are characteristic of your own past self can’t guarantee that you’ll 
do anything specific right now. After you make certain decisions or commit-
ments, that past self becomes something that you have to give meaning and 
significance to in your present situation. Maybe you think your past self was 
nuts. Maybe not!
If that’s true, you’re not identical to your past self. You can always steer the 
ship in a different direction. Being a self is a continual process, a continual 
journey of making choices about what and who you are. At the same time, 
you need to be aware that the you existing now will become a past self. And 
this awareness makes you think about the future in a new way. Every time 
you make a choice or a vow, or choose a direction of life for yourself, you see 
that it’s up to your future self to decide what the meaning of your present 
actions is. So you’re not identical to your future self, and at the same time, 
you’re not identical to your past self (in fact, as we show in Chapter 11, 
Nietzsche thinks that this project of constantly reassessing oneself in light of 
present experience is important to the process of living authentically).

Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
 
This idea can be very unsettling. Coauthor Chris knows what this feels like 
because he has an acute problem with vertigo. For one thing, he hates getting 
on ski lifts. But why? The fear of falling isn’t what unsettles him; he’s unsettled 
by the fear that he will give in to the fear of falling and just toss himself off the 
lift! No matter how he tries to assure himself that it’s safe and that he has 
nothing to worry about, he knows that his future self — the one who’s terrified 
on the lift — is under no compulsion to see things the same way he sees them 
now, before he gets on the lift. Anxiety reveals that your future self may in fact 
do something that you’re now under no power to ultimately prevent. This 
view of yourself can be scary.
 
At each moment, you must choose. Time pushes you along, and at each 
moment, you decide how to reinterpret the situation you’re in by electing to 
take one path and not another. As a result, anxiety reveals a radical freedom 
at the core of your existence, but with it comes a heavy sense of responsibil-
ity. You’re tossed into a particular way of being, one that must always, contin-
uously, address the question of how to live. It’s a great responsibility, and it’s 
up to you to pick it up or run from it.
Of course, you can try to stop the anxiety, and you can try to rid yourself of 
these feelings. The path to do so is very clear: Just reject the insight into 
nothingness and grab hold of something external to you as the reason why 
you make the choices you do. You’ll fall into some preset structure of living 
provided to you by the world around you. Of course, in doing this, you turn 
from your anxiety and fail to live in an honest way. The existentialists insist 
that you not do this. You can live in the face of your anxiety. It’s hard, but no 
one ever said that living life to the fullest should be an easy thing to do.
A love-hate relationship with anxiety
Anxiety, freedom, and nothingness are all subjects that most people are 
ambivalent about. They seem to have a love-hate relationship with it all:
 
 On the one hand, anxiety reveals to you the awe-inspiring nature of what 
you are, and it opens existence to you as a great mystery that you can 
dive into. Yes, you can; you have the ability to take hold of your own 
existence.
 
 On the other hand, engaging with existence without some comforting 
support that you’re doing things right is dreadfully nerve-wracking! 
Anxiety frees you, but it also takes away the illusion you previously had — 
and that illusion made your life neat, clean, and comfortable.
Noticing this dual nature, Kierkegaard called anxiety, specifically in its disclo-
sure of freedom, a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy. That’s 
a mouthful! What did he mean?

71
 Chapter 4: Anxiety, Dread, and Angst in an Empty World
 
Try to recall an experience in which you came face to face with something 
dreadful and scary, but also seductively mysterious at the same time. When 
coauthor Chris was a little kid, that usually related to the great mysteries of 
the dark. The dark always contained all the things that hid behind the every-
day world and lurked in the shadows, always eerily present but never actually 
seen.
The thing that really freaked Chris out was his dark closet, especially when it 
was nighttime, the comforts of daytime weren’t present, and Mom and Dad 
were asleep. The dark closet . . . that’s where they are! Who were “they” to 
the kid Chris? He didn’t know! That’s what freaked him out. That’s why the 
closet was mysterious and full of possibilities. Kid Chris was pretty afraid of 
what hid in there. But at the same time, it induced in him what Kierkegaard 
might call a sweet fear. It was sweet, because it was as enticing as it was 
threatening and repulsive. No matter how much Chris feared the unknown 
that was in the closet, he was drawn to open the door and find out. On one 
hand, he was repulsed; on the other hand, he was deeply attracted to what 
repulsed him.
Existential existence is enticing and unnerving
What anxiety reveals works in a very similar way. If you’re like most people, 
you’re deeply attracted to the mysterious nature of your existence. At the 
same time, you don’t know what it is that you can be. It’s a mystery, because 
what it means to be free can’t be entirely understood in terms of what you 
presently find yourself doing or in terms of the world around you. That’s why 
it’s enticing, but that’s also why it’s dreadfully nerve-wracking. You want to 
try it out, to jump into that freedom, to self-define yourself, but at the same 
time, you’re deeply repulsed by the insecurity that this freedom brings and 
want it to go away.
Choosing to engage: Keeping anxiety alive
The existentialist argues that you must choose your mode of engagement 
within the world. You must take on the question of how to exist for yourself. 
But that means that you have to live with the unsettling nature of anxiety as 
part of your experience. You can’t rely on false portraits of yourself that are 
provided by the world or even by your own past. You have to keep anxiety 
alive in your life. Being fully at the wheel of your life is fun and scary and defi-
nitely unsettling. You can drive where you want. You have no ultimate rea-
sons for taking one road over another. But you may crash, too, and you have 
to take responsibility for that. Whatever you do, the existentialists argue, 
don’t hand the wheel over to someone else.

Part II: The Fundamental Problem: God Is Dead 
Anxiety in the Garden of Eden
Kierkegaard, in his Concept of Anxiety, talked 
about his understanding of the story of the fall 
from grace, or the story of how Adam and Eve 
lost their place in the Garden of Eden. The story 
tells us that God commanded Adam not to eat 
the apples from the tree of the knowledge of 
good and evil, saying that if he did, he would 
surely die. Of course, Adam ate the apple. 
Typically, people explain this story by suggest-
ing that Adam intentionally chose what was 
evil, so they understand the temptation that 
drove Adam to be the apple itself and the knowl-
edge that it contained.
Kierkegaard disagreed. As far as he saw it, 
Adam didn’t know what good and evil were yet; 
he’d have to eat from the tree to find that out. So 
it’s odd to say that he was tempted by evil if he 
couldn’t have any knowledge of it until he ate 
the apple. Instead, Kierkegaard wanted to 
understand Adam’s transgression in a different 
way. As he saw it, the prohibition from God 
(which Adam also didn’t totally understand, 
because he didn’t know what death was either!) 
awakened anxiety in Adam. The anxiety was 
unsettling for Adam because in it, he was awak-
ened out of his innocence (his immediacy, or his 
robotic routine) and into an insight of his own 
possibilities as a free being. Specifically, God’s 
prohibition allowed Adam to become conscious 
of the fact that he could become the kind of 
person who doesn’t do what God tells him to do. 
He didn’t understand what being that kind of 
person would mean; he’d never done it before, 
and it was never really even possible. The pro-
hibition made it possible. With it came the mys-
tery of possibility, the fact that some form of 
existence was waiting for him to fulfill it if he 
wanted to, which was extremely attractive — 
and repulsive — to him.
Essentially, Adam sensed the possibility of 
being something other than what he presently 
was. Thus, for Kierkegaard, anxiety in the face 
of his own possibility is what made his own 
transgression possible. In eating from the tree, 
Adam didn’t choose what was evil; instead, he 
made the choice, or rather a leap, to exist in a 
new way that he didn’t understand. In fact, in 
some Jewish interpretations of the story, this 
very possibility — this creation of an Adam who 
can visualize himself as someone who can 
follow (through faith) or reject (through sin) 
God –– was God’s intention in the first place 
when he gave the prohibition to Adam!

and Authenticity
In This Chapter
 Seeing that life is absurd

 Living authentically by embracing absurdity
 Interpreting Camus’s “Myth of Sisyphus”
O
ne of the enduring appeals of existentialism is that it addresses real 
human issues, describing what life is like and how we as human beings 
should respond. When coauthor Greg was in college, his advisor asked him 
what he wanted to study. Being young and filled with unformed thoughts, 
passions, and anxieties, he said, “Philosophy that deals with important things, 
like life and stuff.” The advisor scoffed and informed him that she had never 
heard of any such nonsense. She knew of no branch of philosophy that dealt 
with “life and stuff.” Obviously, she hadn’t studied much existentialism.
The existentialists consider it extremely important and worth thinking about 
that life is, on the whole, pretty absurd. Although all the existentialists have 
different ways of understanding it, for each of them it’s a mad, mad world, 
and most people don’t deal particularly well with that fact. For some reason, 
people really love having their salad fork in the right place, and they’re really 
irked when things are disorderly. So you can imagine that people probably 
do a lot to try to avoid noticing what a crazy place the world is, but that cra-
ziness peeks through again and again.
Eventually, most people come to a point where absurdity stares them right in 
the face. When that point comes, you have a choice to make: stare it back in 
the face or walk away. The existentialists disagree about a lot of things, but 
they’re pretty unified in thinking that staring absurdity in the face is impor-
tant, because when you do that, you’re living honestly and authentically. 
Each of them has a different way of understanding how that should be done, 
but they all agree on the general program that seeing that life is absurd and 
accepting this fact through living with absurdity in an honest, authentic way 
are crucial aspects of the existential worldview.

74
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In this chapter, we give a general overview of what the existentialists mean 
by saying that life is absurd. After that, we offer a template for understanding 
authenticity and explain why the existentialists think that the best response 
to the absurdity of life must be an authentic one. One of the most popular 
essays on this topic, and a great example for understanding what the existen-
tialists are talking about, is Albert Camus’s “The Myth of Sisyphus.” We help 
you understand what Camus thinks a hero from Greek mythology has to 
teach you about absurdity and authenticity and why he thinks that Sisyphus 
is smiling, despite the fact that he endlessly spends his days and nights 
moving big, heavy rocks around.
Absurdity 101
 
 
The world itself is not unreasonable, that is all that can be said. 
But what is absurd is the confrontation of the irrational and the 
wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart.
—Albert Camus, “The Myth of Sisyphus”
Saying that life is absurd can be understood as a statement about how human 
beings relate to the world. As many existentialists like to say, absurdity (in 
one sense or another) is “our situation,” or the human condition. Camus him-
self described it as a combination of the basic “irrationality” of the world and 
humans’ “wild longing for clarity.”
 
As Camus puts the matter, absurdity means more than just irrationality or cra-
ziness. It isn’t a statement about the world by itself. Absurdity really comes 
from a combination of two things: an irrational world and a person who’s look-
ing out at it and trying to make it rational. You’ve probably had that feeling — 
you know the one; you’re sitting at your desk and looking at the circus around 
you, thinking, “I’m the only sane one here.” For the existentialists, this is how 
human beings as a group look out onto the world. But humans don’t just think 
that they’re the sane ones; they also try to impose that sanity and order on 
the circus around them. The world laughs at them when they do this — and 
this is absurdity.
Defining absurdity
Saying that life is absurd is actually saying a couple of things. First, it says 
something about the world, and second, it says something about the people 
who face that world. Absurdity is the result of putting those two things 
together. Here are the three things to remember:

75
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
 
 Absurdity includes an observation about the world — its irrationality.
 
 Absurdity includes an observation about humans — they long for clarity.
 
 Life’s absurdity results from connecting those two observations.
This is all absurdity really is — the juxtaposition of an irrational world with 
your desire that it not be that way. If you want a deeper understanding, 
though, take a look at the next two sections. We examine each part sepa-
rately, going into a little more detail about what the world is like and what 
people are like. After that, we explain how the two parts together produce 
the absurdity of life that the existentialists are talking about.
Everyday conceptions of absurdity
Typically, you probably take absurdity to mean that something doesn’t make 
sense in an extreme sort of way. When most people say that something is 
absurd, they mean that it’s really, really unreasonable. Absurd things are 
pretty out there. For example, a person may say to you, “Look, the other day 
I saw a cow jump over the moon.” You’d likely reply (well, we hope you 
would) that this is totally absurd. To say that it’s absurd implies that it’s so 
out of whack with what you’d expect that being forced to accept it as true 
would leave you dumbfounded.
 
Whenever you try to understand a philosophical concept or notion, start with 
what everyday language says about its meaning. Start with what regular 
people take the word or phrase to mean to get your feet on some solid ground.
 
Calling something absurd means that it doesn’t make sense, but it doesn’t 
mean that it’s impossible. A big part of the definition is that absurdity doesn’t 
conform to your expectations.
Here’s another example: Imagine that you’re watching an old cowboy movie, 
and you see the bad guy, the dressed-in-black gunslinger. He’s giving off the 
impression that he’s about to inflict some serious damage on someone or 
something. With dramatic movements, he slowly reaches for his pistol and is 
about to shoot down the innocent sheriff of the town. The scene is tense. As 
he slowly approaches the sheriff, he slips on a small toy left behind by a little 
kid who lives in the town. He flips upside down, breaks his neck, and dies 
right there. Whew! The town is saved.
More than likely, such an event would be seen as totally absurd. It’s absurd 
not because it’s impossible, but because it’s totally inconsistent (like a cow 
jumping over the moon) with the way you normally think of the dressed-in-
black bad guys from old Westerns and how they meet their ends. You’d rub 
your eyes and have the projectionist rewind the movie. You’d ask yourself, 
“Did I really just see that?” “That was absurd!” you’d scream.

76
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Likewise, something about life isn’t just unreasonable; it’s completely out of 
whack with what you normally understand life to be. The existentialists also 
tend to agree that encountering the absurdity of human life has a very seri-
ous effect on you. Like the person who’s left speechless in the theater, you’re 
left stunned and speechless when you see a vision of why life is absurd 
(many people say that viewing absurdity leads to anxiety, which we discuss 
in Chapter 4).
Understanding the Irrationality 
of the World
Whenever you encounter an existentialist who calls the world irrational, you 
should remember that each of them means something different by that. Still, 
taken together, this statement usually suggests that something about the 
world is without logic or without pattern or reason. That seems pretty 
straightforward, but you can break it apart and learn a lot. For one thing, the 
world isn’t just a place, but an entire series of objects and events. Traditionally, 
people have tried to find ways of understanding how those objects and 
events fit together. On one level, you can think of existentialism as a reaction 
to this way of thinking. The existentialists are saying that the order or pattern 
that people try to see in the world — or impose upon it — doesn’t really have 
any ultimate grounding or foundation, because the world is without neces-
sary structure. To acknowledge that, however, isn’t an easy task!
What makes up the world
 
The existentialists talk a lot about the nature of the world — but what do they 
mean by the world? In common discourse, people tend to throw the term 
around a lot and use it differently, so we want to be clear on what existential-
ists mean by it. Specifically, they consider the world to be the sum of every-
thing that has existed and that does exist, past and present: all the objects and 
all the ways that those objects have ever been related to one another. That’s 
the world (in Chapter 6, we look at Heidegger’s notion of the world, which is 
slightly different).
Try to work up to this notion of the world from your own way of using the 
term in everyday conversation. Typically, people tend to consider the world 
the collection of all the objects that currently exist. Consequently, people say 
things like “There’s no one in the world who could make a martini like you” 
or “Someday, I’d like to travel the world.” So when they think world, they 
think of a huge container with lots of things in it. The existentialists certainly 

77
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
don’t disagree with this sense of the term world, because they think that 
those things are in the world too. But they want to add a bit to the notion and 
try to make the contents of the world somewhat bigger.
What else can you add to it? Well, the first thing you could do is let the world 
be a collection of things that spans time, or at least that spans time into the 
past. So we propose that you beef up your concept of the world and think of 
it as the sum of all the objects that have ever existed and all the objects that 
exist right now. Understood like this, the world is full of things like chairs; 
your car; Caesar, the emperor of Rome; the moon; you; me; and so on to 
include all past and present objects. To be sure, that’s a lot of stuff.
Still, that’s not all the world is. It’s even bigger for the existentialists! The 
next thing to add actually does conform to some intuitions you may have 
about what the world is. You can detect it when you hear things like “Nothing 
weirder than that has ever happened in this world!” This speaker seems to be 
implying that events or happenings are part of the world too. So there’s your 
mom, and then there’s your living room. And there’s also the fact that your 
mom is sitting in your living room. That’s another thing (an event or happen-
ing) added to the world. So is the fact that the Boston Red Sox won the World 
Series. That’s a part of the world too (though it’s an ugly part of the world, 
according to coauthor Chris!). Seen in this way, the world is a pretty massive 
thing. It includes all the objects, present and past, and all history too.
Different ways of seeing order in the world
We don’t know about you, but the world looks pretty orderly to us. We bet 
that it looks pretty orderly to you too. Think about the world as you under-
stand it — everything that is and has ever existed, and every past and cur-
rent happening and event. Now think: Isn’t it hard not to think of it as fitting 
together in some way? Doesn’t it look to you as though every object has a 
reason for existing? Doesn’t it look as though everything that has happened 
(or is happening) did so for some reason (even if you don’t know what it is)? 
Seeing things this way isn’t hard. People may see the order in different ways, 
but they seem to always claim that it’s out there.
 
Seeing order in the world can take a variety of forms. Chris remembers having 
a friend who very consistently cheated on his girlfriend. Chris thought that 
this was pretty despicable conduct, but the friend always explained it off in 
the same way. He said that he was a guy, and guys are driven to this sort 
of behavior by their biology. He saw the world in a certain way. He was an 
object in the world, and so was his girlfriend, and so was the fact that he 
wasn’t faithful — an event. He saw himself as an object (a guy) that had 
certain properties (driven by biology to cheat).

78
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Thus, when he cheated, his behavior made sense to him. It all came together. 
His behavior (an event) was logical and followed from what he was in a very 
rational way. It may have been a vicious rationalization, but it helped him 
make sense of himself and his own past behavior.
Believing in God or fate
Another way (though quite different in form) to see order or logic in the 
world is to believe in fate. Perhaps you think that everything has a place in 
God’s plan. According to this way of seeing things, each thing plays a specific 
role in God’s plan. As such, when things happen to you, they don’t necessar-
ily make sense to you in a scientific sense (as with Chris’s cheating friend) but 
in a fatalistic sense.
Fate is creepy in a way, but it’s easy to understand. You remember Oedipus, 
right? He was the guy from Greek mythology who was fated to marry his 
mother and kill his father (weird stuff, we know). Because it was fated, it 
didn’t matter what Oedipus did to try to stop it from happening. That was his 
role in life, and much as he tried to avoid it, it would come to pass anyway. 
Weird, but Oedipus’s world still makes sense; it’s an orderly world, for sure.
Some people think of their own lives in this way. They think that when they 
meet their future wives or husbands, it’s destiny or fate. We’ve heard people 
claim, when they lose their jobs, for example, that it will all work out because 
“everything happens for a reason.” In fact, some people actually do lose their 
jobs and then get better ones. Usually, when this sort of thing happens, such 
people tend to come to see the two events as being closely and directly 
related. Now of course, in one sense this is true; to get a better job, you need 
to first lose the original one. But that’s not the kind of connection these folks 
Everything has a function
According to the fourth-century Greek philoso-
pher Aristotle (384–322 BC), in the world “every-
thing is connected.” According to Aristotle, 
everything that exists can be given a place in a 
great pyramidlike structure. The pyramid works 
like this: All the things at one level exist because 
they play a role (they have a function) in con-
tributing to the well-being or survival (or func-
tion) of the things at the next level up. So, for 
example, Aristotle put animals lower in the 
pyramid than humans because he thought that 
animals exist to do work (and provide food) for 
humans. Humans are then freed to perform their 
(higher) function: to be good citizens and to 
think about philosophy (cool deal for us, the phi-
losophers!). According to Aristotle, everything 
that exists can be fit into this pyramidlike struc-
ture, giving everything a reason for existing. To 
think like Aristotle is to believe that everything 
has a place and that everything has a function.

79
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
mean. Instead, they’re implying that they lost the first job so that the better 
job could come to pass. That’s a very different sense of fate!
Finding innate meaning or significance in events
Some existentialists, especially Friedrich Nietzsche (see Chapters 3 and 11 
for more on this philosopher), noted one odd thing about seeing order and 
purpose in the world: that the desire for order seems to markedly increase to 
the degree to which it’s painful to believe otherwise. If you lose your job, and 
it causes you distress and suffering, you want it to mean something. As 
Nietzsche once said, suffering isn’t something that people find terribly prob-
lematic. What people do find problematic, he noted, is meaningless suffering. 
So if you can give that traumatic event meaning by placing it in a bigger pic-
ture, you’re likely to do so.
You see this tendency when what appear to be senseless tragedies occur 
around you or in the news. To take an extreme example, you may hear about 
the death of a small child, especially a child who in some way touched your 
life, and you find yourself simply horrified to the bone by the idea that the 
child’s death was just an accident — an event that played no larger role in 
the world, past, present, or future. It repulses you to think that it just hap-
pened, and that’s all there is to it. Instead, you think it must have some larger 
justification that gives it meaning and significance. Maybe it’s that it all works 
out in God’s plan. Maybe it’s that it happened so that tougher laws will even-
tually be passed that wind up saving even more children’s lives. But in such 
cases, most people are pretty insistent that it had better be something.
An important part of this story about believing in the logic of the world is 
this: Humans don’t think of themselves as being the ones who gave the world 
its meaning and significance. Instead, in the previous example, you seem to 
think that whether that small child’s death is meaningful isn’t something that 
you decide or create. The meaning, or significance, of all worldly objects and 
events is already given. It may be given by God’s plan. It may be given by fate 
or even by science. Or maybe it’s given by reason. In any case, its signifi-
cance is something exterior to you; most people consider it their job to dis-
cover what that significance is (if they can).
Like it or not, the world 
is entirely irrational
The existentialists think that the world isn’t an orderly place at all. Instead, 
the world is fundamentally irrational. It has no necessary structure, no intrin-
sic meaning, no innate significance, and no internal purpose whatsoever on 
its own. They believe that nothing is out there to discover at all.

80
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
When they say that the world is irrational, you shouldn’t take them to mean 
that you can’t explain why particular things happen. Existentialists still think 
that cars get flat tires because they run out of air or that objects fall because 
gravity operates on them. They mean something a bit different — that there’s 
no purpose to the world, that there’s no ultimate big plan or big picture into 
which everything fits and gets its meaning.
This suggestion about the irrationality of the world isn’t an easy one to swal-
low. Think about it. When you see order (or purpose or meaning) in the world, 
it allows you — on a very fundamental level — to feel at home in that world. You 
can feel most comfortable with yourself and with your actions when they fit 
into some larger schema outside you. This external framework can, in a way, 
be comforting because it gives you assurance that a kind of glue is holding 
everything together and that you can fit into the framework. The existential-
ists reject this idea — the senseless death of a small child, no matter how 
horrible you may think it is, doesn’t fit into any larger, pre-established plan 
or logic. It just is. It just happens. It is senseless in the big picture because . . . 
well, there is no big picture at all!
Viewing Irrationality from 
a Human Perspective
Seeing the world as irrational in the existentialist sense isn’t the normal way 
in which most people see the things around them. In fact, seeing the world as 
an orderly, rational place is natural. In fact, it would be pretty hard to get 
through the day easily if you didn’t see it this way. When coauthor Greg 
Do you think the world is an orderly place?
Is the world really an irrational place? How do 
you see things? To see whether you have a 
similar belief system to the existentialists, ask 
yourself these questions:
  Do you think that everything that occurs 
happens for a reason?
  Do you think that you fit into a larger cosmic 
or divine plan?
  When you meet someone new, do you ever 
think that you were destined to meet?
  When a random tragedy occurs, do you 
insist on asking why?
  Do you see the troubles in life as a test or 
challenge that you were meant to either 
overcome or learn from?
Later in this chapter, you see that having an 
emotional pull to saying “yes” to any of these 
questions is part of being human. But if answer-
ing “yes” is your considered opinion, you’re not 
particularly existential!

81
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
hears a buzzer sound in the morning, he hears his alarm clock — not just a 
buzzer — and its function (or purpose) is to wake him. That’s what it is, and 
that’s what the sound means. He responds to the sound and gets up because 
he’s a teacher, and he needs to be at work at 9 a.m. Teaching is his role, his 
function, so it makes sense that he responds to the noise coming from the 
little box on his bedside table and moves in predictable and understandable 
ways toward the shower.
Perhaps Greg decides what the buzzer means and represents; maybe it 
doesn’t have this function independently of him. But everything in his world 
could be interpreted differently. If Greg is continually aware of this fact as he 
moves through his day, the seamless nature of his interaction with the world 
is threatened. Typically, our ability to effortlessly move through the world of 
our routines is dependent on our ability to simply respond to what we take 
things to mean. We just respond to those meanings. If every morning you 
asked, again, “Is that what I choose to have that buzzer mean?” and if you 
repeated this exercise for everything around you, it would exhaust you and 
cut you off from your life.
How long can you make it through your day reminding yourself that the 
meanings of things around you are really assigned by you and by others? 
Does the difficulty of keeping this kind of experiment going mean that the 
things in the world really do have intrinsic meanings, or does it point to the 
fact that it’s hard to avoid making it look that way?
If things really do look to be so connected and chock full of meanings, if the 
world and events in it really appear to be fully rational and full of signifi-
cance, how did the existentialists come to see the world as irrational and 
accidental? The problem can be extended to the rest of humanity. If you’re 
still having problems seeing this lack of intrinsic meaning in things (or if you 
had a problem doing that last assignment), what can the existentialists do to 
help you see this? Unfortunately, it looks like they can’t do anything to help 
you “see accidents everywhere” if you don’t see them already.
How you can come to see 
accidents everywhere
 
 
There are no facts, only interpretations.
—Friedrich Nietzsche
You see the world through the filter of your experiences. Assume that you 
and your friend are looking at a sunset. You’re both looking at exactly the 
same thing — you’re having just the same sensory experiences — yet when 
you describe it, you both give very different explanations of what you see. 
You see a somber event, whereas your friend sees a happy event that signals 

82
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
rebirth. You don’t see the world with just your physical eyes; you experience 
the world through the filter of your experiences, and your experiences differ 
from other people’s experiences. A person coming from a recent breakup 
may see the sunset as depressing (such a person sees it as a sign of some-
thing ending), whereas someone without that experience may see it quite 
differently.
Because the way you see things depends on your experiences, it makes sense 
to say that how the world is interpreted, or what it means, depends on you. 
Sometimes, seeing things differently results from reading a play (many of the 
existentialists meant their more artistic writings to create these kinds of 
crisis situations within their readers, allowing them to see the world in funda-
mentally different ways). Sometimes, however, sudden and dramatic life 
events can do the trick, forcing you to recognize the fact that the meanings 
that the world takes on are really of your own making.
 
Many years ago, coauthor Chris had a very bad car accident (flipping a car 
over numerous times!), yet he emerged surprisingly unharmed. Afterward, 
Chris remembers distinctly feeling strangely alienated from his normal life and 
routine. All of a sudden, he became aware that working in the career he was 
engaged in at the time wasn’t necessarily what he had to do. Before the acci-
dent, he had grown so accustomed to the job that it seemed natural and even 
essential to who he was. He couldn’t imagine being separate from it. He had 
never really questioned the connection between it and his life.
Suddenly, after the accident, the same world was different; it was as though 
he had been long asleep and had suddenly awakened to the fact that the 
world around him could actually be seen in very different ways, that he 
wasn’t locked into any one interpretation. On the one hand, it was an alienat-
ing experience, because Chris felt suddenly separate and isolated from the 
meanings the world had taken on before the accident. This experience of 
seeing those meanings as unnecessary, or as truly accidental, seemed to rip 
him out of the seamless nature of his routine (as we discuss in Chapter 4, 
anxiety has this very same effect). At the same time, however, it was very 
uplifting! Chris felt strangely not at home in his own world, but at the same 
time he felt invigorated, as though possibilities were multiplying for him.
Such realizations, whatever their cause, have one thing in common: You’re 
suddenly brought face to face with the recognition that existence (your own 
or that of things or other people) seems indifferent to the ways that you 
decide to categorize it. You come face to face with the fact that the world 
isn’t defined by any of the ways in which you choose to see and understand it 
(or yourself) at any point in time. As Jean-Paul Sartre put it, existence over-
flows the categories you try to understand it through.

83
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
You’re addicted to imposing 
order on the world
Human beings naturally desire order. To use Camus’s phase, we “long for 
clarity.” Think about what seems to happen when something dramatic occurs, 
like a near-fatal car accident or the death of a child — something that can 
shake your view of how you and the world fit together (or just how the world 
fits together itself).
After such an event, nothing makes sense; you see the world as accidental. It 
seems that no matter how you choose to reorganize the pieces, they could 
always be reorganized yet again in some different way. These endless possi-
bilities reinforce your view that the world has no inherent order and no way 
in which it should be organized. Yet even in these circumstances, you can’t 
help but organize it anyway. Even if you try to opt out and stop trying to 
unify the world in a way that helps make it more sensible and orderly, you 
just can’t do it. At times, you probably even feel ridiculous, trying futilely to 
foist order on something that doesn’t want it and didn’t have it to begin with.
 
As the existentialists see it, people are all essentially obsessive-compulsive 
about their worlds being ordered. They may be sloppy, they may not clean 
their homes, and they may not be able to find the remote control when they 
want it, but they’re all obsessive about the world having some kind of shape 
and meaning, and they want themselves to fit into that meaning. Your projects 
and plans and ambitions make sense; your actions are intelligible. Ordering 
Conspiracy theories: When there just must be a 
better — and bigger! — reason
Sometimes, the things that happen in the world 
are so big that even if you get a reason, you still 
get the feeling of absurdity. When big things 
happen, like the death of a president or the 
destruction of the World Trade Center, and 
you’re given a pat answer like “It was a lone 
gunman” or “It was Al-Qaeda terrorists,” you 
feel almost let down. It couldn’t be that simple. 
Your mind looks for a reason, an order, a pat-
tern, and it must be a reason as big and power-
ful as you see the event as being.
Surely one lonely gunman couldn’t have robbed 
Americans of the most powerful man in the 
world, the most charismatic president in U.S. 
history. That wouldn’t be significant enough to 
make sense of the event. A few extremists with 
box cutters couldn’t have perpetrated the most 
devastating and deadly attack on U.S. soil in 
history. That would be absurd.

84
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
the world is what you do. You can’t escape it. You always evaluate and unify 
(through your various explanations and conceptual schemes) what’s inher-
ently unstructured, or what’s inherently irrational and without logic and 
reason. As Nietzsche once put it, “Man first implanted values into things to 
maintain himself — he created the meaning of things. A human meaning! 
Therefore he calls himself ‘man’, that is, the evaluator!”
People are driven to make sense of what simply can’t be made sense of. It’s 
just who we are. You’re driven to unify things, to bring things together in 
ways that attempt to make more and more sense of what’s around you.
The absurdity of imposing 
order on the disorderly
Essentially, the existentialist recognition about human life is this: We’re 
forced by our nature to be obsessive creators of meaning, and we can’t help 
but do this in a resolute and serious way. We don’t just choose values or 
schemes; we don’t do it listlessly as though we really don’t care about the 
way we’re making sense of things.
Instead, we choose with firmness and determination. It means something to us to 
see the world one way and not another way; after all, the way in which we see 
the world is central to who we are. So we’re very serious about our attempts to 
unify and give meaning to the world and to ourselves — even if, in the vast 
number of cases, we don’t consciously recognize that we’re doing it.
Instead, we seem to create the meaning and order that we see in the world 
and then we appear to mistake it as something that we found or discovered in 
the world itself. When you see things as they really are, you get a glimpse 
into not only the fact that the world has no form, but also that you’ve been 
giving it the order that it appears to have.
Although you’re forced by what you are to resolutely impose order on the 
world around you, nothing about your project finds any justification at all, 
because the world itself provides no support for what you’re doing. In fact, 
it’s indifferent to us and our schemes. It’s almost as though human nature is 
in an inevitable confrontation with the nature of the world. The world is irra-
tional, but you nonetheless try to make sense of it.
 
Thus, you seem trapped in an activity that appears to have no justification or 
meaning. It appears unreasonable — not that the world is irrational or that 
humans are order imposers, but that you must give the world a unified char-
acter that you embrace with seriousness when in reality, no way of unifying 
the world has any grounding or support whatsoever. Absurdity is the fact that 
the two must coexist side by side.

85
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
What you learn is that your desire for order, structure, and meaning finds no 
happily accommodating world eager to fulfill your wants by providing answers. 
Just like the dressed-in-black bad guy from the Western who slips on a child’s 
toy (check out our example of absurdity earlier in this chapter), you can 
imagine someone saying, “Look at that creature who can’t avoid the task of 
continually creating meaning and unity for the world when it doesn’t have 
any — how absurd!” You may even envision a comedy (though a comedy with 
a tragic feel!) being written about such creatures (in fact, Nietzsche’s fictional 
work Thus Spoke Zarathustra is an attempt to describe a character who expe-
riences just these sorts of insights). Think of an alien life form watching us as 
we furiously work at giving the world meaning, like ants scampering around 
making an anthill in the midst of the crashing ocean waves that keep knock-
ing it back down again. We can imagine the spectators laughing at us, think-
ing, “How futile are its efforts! How comical this is!”
The inkblot test: Forcing yourself to see order
Try it out yourself! What do you see in this pic-
ture? Can you force yourself to look at the pic-
ture and see nothing there? Or do you keep 
returning to seeing something orderly in the ink-
blot? According to the existentialists, you just 
can’t help it. You’re addicted! Put simply: You 
have an addiction to creating values or mean-
ings that you create to make sense of the world 
in which you live. And you can’t kick the habit!

86
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
From this perspective, do you have any question about why the existential-
ists think that life is absurd?
Authenticity 101: Striving to Be Genuine
For the existentialists, the only successful way to deal with the absurdity of 
life is through living authentically. Although not all existentialists use the spe-
cific term authenticity (different existentialists use different terms to express 
Making sense of the absurd
What’s depicted in the Escher drawing is a 
three-dimensional impossibility. It doesn’t make 
sense. Yet your brain and visual system can’t 
help but try to make sense of it. This is an 
encounter with an interesting situation: Your 
longing for clarity comes into contact with what 
can’t be made clear. Like the world, the picture 
rebuffs your attempts to make sense of it. 
Looking at it evokes the feeling of absurdity.

 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
it, and they all have different ways to specifically understand how the con-
cept works), they all agree that it’s important that we struggle to acquire it in 
our lives.
 
At the simplest level, existentialists think that living authentically is important 
because it means living in accord with who you are or being true to who you 
are. As Friedrich Nietzsche once put it, the goal is to “become what you 
already are!” It means representing yourself in a way that can be considered 
genuine, which means embracing the fact that you must confront the world in 
your own individual way. When you look at it this way, it’s hard to imagine 
that many people (if anyone!) would reject this goal. Most people tend to 
believe that living genuinely in this way is important.
It’s not easy to do, though. We offer two reasons for this difficulty:
 
 Living authentically causes lots of discomfort in your life. Allowing the 
way in which you live to reflect a kind of conformity to the world and the 
pregiven meanings people present to you is always easier to do. Confor-
ming to the crowd is easier than being your own person. But you need to 
be able to resist being absorbed; existentialists think that no one should 
hide from what he is.
 
 Living authentically is hard to do because although the existentialist 
notion of authenticity is similar to the common-sense notion of 
authenticity, the existentialist version differs in an important — but 
complicated — way.
 
 The existentialists stress that being true to yourself means reflecting in 
your ways of living the kind of being that you are. In other words, you’re 
living in the world in a way that reflects the fact that your eyes are wide 
open to your nature as an absurd being. You’re living in a way that 
acknowledges the fact that whatever life path you pick to follow, you’ll 
never receive any external justification for why that path was the right 
one for you to take.
The connection between authenticity 
and genuineness
 
A good way to start analyzing what the existentialists mean by authenticity 
is to first look at the way you use that term in your own common language. 
Almost always, the term is used to describe something that’s real or genuine, 
and inauthentic is used to describe something that’s artificial, counterfeit, or 
fake. This meaning reflects a key aspect of authenticity: An authentic thing is 
always true to its own nature.

88
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
As an example, suppose that you go to see the Shakespeare play Julius 
Caesar. You wouldn’t say that the sword that an actor carries onstage is an 
authentic Roman sword, because it isn’t real; after all, genuine, authentic 
swords aren’t made of cardboard, right? It’s a fake — a stage prop!
Here’s another example: Maybe you’ve heard the term authenticity used on 
those television auction shows when a person brings in what appears to be 
an antique item of furniture. A very serious-minded representative on the 
program examines the piece, looking to see whether it’s authentic. What he’s 
checking is whether the piece is actually from the old time period that the 
person claims it’s from. The more authentic the piece is in this case, the 
more it is a true and real representative of that older period.
At this point, you appear to have a pretty simple motto for living a good exis-
tential life: living in ways that are real and genuine as opposed to being fake 
or counterfeit. Who’d want to be a fake?
Everybody digs authenticity
One interesting thing about authentic objects, like swords and antique pieces 
of furniture, is that what’s genuine is almost always worth more than what’s 
counterfeit. In a general sense, being real or genuine is just understood as 
valuable. In the case of living authentically, of course, living in a genuine or 
real way doesn’t mean that you’re suddenly worth a lot of money. Instead, 
most existentialists would say that the way that you’re living is more admira-
ble (some celebrate authenticity, but still deny that it’s better, whereas 
others are pretty clear that it should be preferred to inauthenticity).
Authenticity in popular culture
Take a stroll through a bookstore, and you 
quickly discover the large number of books 
devoted to the task of rediscovering authentic-
ity in different aspects of human life. Some deal 
with rediscovering the art of authentic parent-
ing, while others deal with how to be authenti-
cally faithful in one’s romantic relationships. 
Some are more general, dealing with how to 
live an authentic life, while others are geared 
toward the project of making money while not 
losing one’s authenticity. Some books even 
start out by recognizing that because authentic-
ity is accorded such a high premium in society, 
corporations ought to learn to develop business 
models that focus on promoting an image of 
corporate authenticity. Their message: 
Authenticity sells. At the very least, one thing is 
certain: The pursuit of authenticity is selling lots 
of books!

89
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Perhaps you feel differently and are saying, “Hey, stop this train and let me 
off — I don’t really care about authenticity at all!” We’ll be honest — if that’s 
what you’re saying, you’re in the serious minority, at least in today’s culture. 
Now, it may well be the case that few people are authentic, and it may even 
be true that few people truly strive for authenticity, but we haven’t met very 
many people who honestly admit to not caring about it at all.
In fact, what we’ve noticed is the exact opposite. Most of the people we know 
appear to feel strongly that authenticity is a highly desirable and admirable 
trait. These people are always bemoaning the fact that modern life isn’t terri-
bly authentic and that people just aren’t willing to be themselves. We hear it 
all the time — around the water cooler, at lunch, in the bar. Most people, the 
conversation typically goes, are fake and artificial.
And it’s just not cool. Most people seem to really despise inauthenticity and 
tend to cringe when they feel that they’ve identified it in themselves or in 
other people around them. This is especially true the closer the person in 
question is to you. This isn’t surprising; if caring more about people the 
closer they are to you is natural (and it is), and if you think that authenticity 
is admirable and the lack of it is dishonorable in some way, you want the 
people closest to you to display authenticity.
 
Of course, of all the people who are close to you, you are the most central. No 
one is closer to you than you. It’s not surprising, then, that people have a deep 
desire for authenticity in their own lives and that they tend to cringe when 
they suspect that they’ve been artificial in some situation. We know that when 
this happens to us, we have a hard time sleeping well at night.
Matching just the right template
Knowing whether something is authentic requires first answering a crucial 
question: an authentic what? So you don’t just ask whether something is 
authentic; you need an idea of what the thing in question is claiming to be 
and then you can ask whether it succeeds in that task. So if you claim to be 
an authentic Red Sox fan, the only way that we can verify whether you’re 
indeed one requires that we first find out what a Red Sox fan really looks like 
(because he’s a Yankees fan, we’ll refrain from letting Chris give that descrip-
tion). After we have that description, we can check the alleged Red Sox fan 
against that information to see whether he passes the sniff test — to see 
whether that person matches the right template (our idea of what a real Red 
Sox fan looks like). This tells you that:
 
 Authenticity requires that a template or standard can be used to deter-
mine whether a given thing is real or artificial in some key respect (real 
Roman swords exist, or real Red Sox fans exist; you can know what they 
are and how they look; and you can test to see whether a thing is one of 
them).

Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
 A thing is authentic when it matches the template or standard.
 
 A thing is inauthentic when it doesn’t match that template or standard.
When it comes to nonhuman objects, seeing whether a particular thing is an 
authentic X or Y is fairly straightforward. Suppose that an actor on a stage 
claims that the wooden object he’s holding is an authentic Roman sword 
from the time of Julius Caesar. The first thing you do is check the age of the 
object. If it’s only 5 years old, it fails the sniff test, because such a sword 
would need to be at least 2,000 years old to be a real Roman sword of this 
type. Even easier, of course, you might just point out that it fails the sniff test 
because it’s made of cardboard, and real Roman swords from that time 
period were never made of that (if they had been, Caesar’s legions wouldn’t 
have been terribly successful in battle).
Of course, the existentialists don’t care about swords. They want to apply the 
notion of authenticity to a very different type of entity — to you (and all 
people). What they’re claiming is that you can succeed or fail in the task of 
being an authentic person. If the understanding of authenticity as genuine-
ness applied to people as well as to swords, you’d be able to find a template 
that allows you to know what an authentic person looks like. If you could 
acquire such knowledge, all you’d need to do is look at a particular person 
and see whether that person passes the sniff test. But we’ll be honest — that 
sounds pretty odd! How can a template tell you when you’re a real, genuine, 
or authentic person?
 
One thing the existentialists are adamant about is this: Unlike the case of the 
sword, in which the template is external to it, the question of human authen-
ticity is determined by matching up to a standard that’s internal to the person. 
If you can understand what that template is, you can check this or that person 
to see whether he’s passing the sniff test. What this info reveals is a central 
facet of authentic living: Pursuing authenticity requires understanding your-
self, just as it requires understanding what a sword is to know whether some 
object is a true, authentic sword.
Understanding authenticity 
as representing
All this talk about genuineness, internal and external templates, and sniff 
tests brings us to an essential aspect of what it means to be authentic for 
existentialists: It requires correct representation. To make the general point, 
we start with an object that we abstractly call an X. If an X is authentic in its 
way of existing, it exists in the world in a way that truly and accurately repre-
sents what that X truly is (that would be the template that determines what 
Xs really are). So X’s authenticity rests on whether X, in its way of existing, is 
correctly represented as an X.

91
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
This way of understanding authenticity, however, presents a dilemma: If an 
existentialist argues that you ought to become what you already are, how is it 
possible that you’re not already what you are (whatever that turns out to 
be)? Isn’t it impossible to fail to be what you already are? How can a thing 
exist in a way that differs from what it really is? If this is impossible, isn’t 
everyone authentic by default? If so, being authentic wouldn’t appear to be 
so difficult — everyone is from beginning to end!
 
Continuing to look at what representing means for existentialists can provide 
you with some clues to solve this paradox. Things can be represented in dif-
ferent ways, and the differences relate to the different ways that things could 
be said to exist:
 
 Some things exist in such a way that if they can be said to represent at 
all, it’s only insofar as something else does the representing for them 
(poor things!).
 
 For other types of beings, the way that they exist is very different — 
those things can represent themselves (which is a way cooler way to be, 
if you ask us).
Need some examples? Existentialists want you to see that two types of beings 
are in the world: things and people. A thing like a piece of wood is just a piece of 
wood (and will never be more than that) until someone else chooses to repre-
sent it as something (say, as a real sword in a play). A person, on the other hand, 
can choose to represent himself in the way in which he chooses to live his life. 
The way in which you exist is fundamentally an issue of your own choosing. The 
way a thing exists isn’t. Things just lie around. Humans, on the other hand, 
choose to define themselves in the direction that they give to their lives.
These two different ways of existence help you see a very basic truth: The 
way that an object exists implies that objects can’t misrepresent themselves 
(because they can’t represent themselves in the first place!). But the way in 
which people exist opens the door to misrepresentation. As a result, it’s up 
to you whether you choose to exist in a way that’s harmonious with what you 
truly are (whether you live in accord with the template that reveals who you 
are). Given that a person can choose not to do this, a person can fail to be 
what he already is by choosing not to represent himself accurately in the way 
that he lives his life. Understood in this way, the paradox is solved: People 
can fail to be what they already are. Here are some additional examples:
 
 The authenticity of a thing depends on how some other entity represents 
it. So a wooden sword in a play is authentic if it’s used by an actor to 
represent a wooden sword. If it’s used to represent an antique Roman 
sword, it’s not authentic.
 
 The authenticity of a person depends on how that person uses or repre-
sents himself through living. So if someone is by nature an individual, 
but he lives only by the opinions of others, he’s misrepresenting what 
he is and failing to be authentic.

92
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Authentic people: In the driver’s 
seat and in control
Why do people — existentialists included — seem to care so much about 
authenticity? What’s the big deal? Why does failing to be authentic look 
undignified? We think that the main reason is that authentic people are in 
control of their own lives. They’re in the driver’s seat. If you’re not driving 
the car, someone else is. If you’re not authentic, you’re not driving your car 
(yourself).
Suppose that you’re an X (whatever that is). If you act in a way that portrays 
yourself as a Y, being an X isn’t really a factor in how you’re living your life. 
But because you’re really an X, it’s as though some imposter is in control of 
your life. You aren’t in the driver’s seat.
Taking Stock: Who Am I? 
How Can I Be Authentic?
Authenticity means living in a way that represents accurately who you are. 
This implies knowing the answer to a key question: Who am I? To answer, 
existentialists think that you have an internal template or standard for you 
and your way of existing, and that template forms the basis for being the kind 
of entity that you are. You need to figure out what that template tells you 
Representin’!
Represent can have many meanings — to por-
tray, to stand for, or to be a good example of. 
We think that the way the existentialists use the 
word is close to the modern slang usage: to 
present, or embody in a positive way, a certain 
group, idea, or ideal through one’s words and 
actions. For existentialists, representing means 
being accurate and uncompromisingly true. 
According to the Hip Hop Dictionary (www.hip
hopintel.com/hiphopdictionary), 
represent means “to make a statement with 
your presence, words, and actions. Come strong 
or don’t come at all type action.”
If you say that you’re “representin’ Brooklyn!” 
you suggest that the way that you’re living 
accurately represents the way someone from 
Brooklyn lives. Not surprisingly, in the vernacu-
lar, failing to properly represent oneself is seen 
negatively. At times, such people are seen as 
“going out like punks” (living cowardly), and in 
other cases, such a person is described as 
“playing himself” (treating himself as undigni-
fied by playing the fool).

93
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
about yourself. After that’s done, you can check to see whether the way that 
you’re living passes the sniff test and is authentic.
We, in the existential sense, are the kinds of beings who are bound to the 
endless task of representing who we are in a world that has no intrinsic 
meaning (and so is ultimately meaningless). Our way of existing is absurd. 
You’re forced to pick life directions because you exist in the world, so you 
take positions on how to represent (or orient) yourself within that world. 
However, nothing within that world ever supports one way of choosing life 
direction as being better or more justified than any other. The choice is 
always yours alone.
What this information reveals is that existential authenticity has little to do 
with what a person does and instead is concerned with how a person chooses 
the direction of his life (we explore the difference between “how” and “what” 
living in Chapter 7). What’s important is that you reflect, in your way of 
approaching life, a basic set of truths that emerges from your nature as an 
absurd being. To embrace your absurdity through living, your choices need 
to reflect the fact that you exist in the world in a very unique way, that 
humans are passionate beings, that people are free and unique, that every-
one dies, and that you aren’t alone in this strange world that you live in.
Why existentialists reject 
worldly authenticity
When the existentialists talk about authenticity, they don’t mean that a 
person, to be authentic, has to make this particular choice or that one. 
Believing that a specific set of choices is key to authenticity is to hold to 
worldly authenticity — the belief that authenticity is achieved by interacting 
with the specific objects in the world in certain, particular ways.
Why might a person believe that this is the path to authenticity? The most 
common reason is because such a person would think that the answer to 
who he is can be found in his character, his personality, his genetics, or per-
haps even in his social role. In fact, when your friends and family talk about 
the loss of authenticity in the world, this is most likely the kind of authentic-
ity that they’re talking about. Thus, you may be surprised when you see your 
friend doing what seem to be uncharacteristic acts because they’re inconsis-
tent with his beliefs or desires.
One key fact about this notion of authenticity is that it concerns what the 
person does. If your friend is an atheist, you’ll likely label him as inauthentic 
if he winds up praying in church because he’s not being true to who he is. In 
this case, the way that you understand the template that tells you about a 
person’s identity is defined by psychology or perhaps biology.

94
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
So worldly authenticity means that being who you are requires choosing spe-
cific life alternatives that conform to your beliefs, desires, basic psychology, 
or character.
The existentialists reject this notion. For the existentialist, who you are as an 
individual being can’t be summed up by or reduced to your current beliefs, 
your character, or your biology. As a result, thinking of authenticity as 
demanding that you be consistent with these things may actually entail inau-
thenticity, because it has you conform to something that doesn’t express 
what you really are.
Embracing existential authenticity: Seeing 
the kind of being that you are
Unlike worldly authenticity, existential authenticity doesn’t concern itself 
with the specific life plans that you choose. Instead, existentialists label such 
life plans as inauthentic if they aren’t chosen or, once chosen, lived or 
embodied in the right way. This being so, they concern themselves with how 
you approach your life. Being authentic or inauthentic is possible when 
you’re doing just about anything. What it comes down to is how you do it.
Søren Kierkegaard, in his famous book Fear and Trembling, talks about the 
fact that his exemplary authentic person — the knight of faith (if you’re inter-
ested in knowing more about this one, check out Chapter 10) — may be a tax 
collector or some otherwise ordinary person doing very mundane things and 
tasks. He warns us away from thinking that true authenticity requires a cer-
tain type of worldly life.
So the how matters more than the what, but what does that mean? Think of it 
like this: Existentialists think that if a choice is authentic, it must be true that 
it follows from the right procedure.
We use ourselves for this example. Greg always makes his choices by using 
reason. He deliberates slowly and patiently about what to do and then he 
chooses. Chris, on the other hand, doesn’t use reason; in fact, he doesn’t 
even deliberate. He just unthinkingly does whatever his emotions dictate at 
any given moment. Now, it could be the case that Greg and Chris, on some 
given occasion, pick exactly the same thing to do. Would you be suspicious 
of Chris’s choices in this example? Would you be prepared to perhaps refuse 
to say that Chris acted authentically? If so, you think that how he came to do 
what he did matters.

95
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
When you think of being yourself in that kind of way, you’re using another 
notion of what it means to be you. In this case, you’re thinking that a person 
can’t be authentic if his choices don’t flow from his nature as the kind of 
being he is. Most people you talk to will likely argue that rationality is an 
essential component of being human. As a result, they have a hard time 
seeing Chris’s choices as emerging from a fundamental aspect of his true 
nature, and as a result, they think that Chris’s nonrational choice-making 
bars him from authenticity.
Although existentialists don’t demand that authentic choices or lives follow 
from a commitment to rationality, this example highlights a fundamental 
notion of their understanding of authentic identity. What they want you to be 
concerned with is the issue of finding out the type of being you are and then 
approaching life in a way that is consistent with it.
 
One way to put this is to say that existentialists are concerned with your exis-
tential situation, which is your nature as an existentially existing human being; 
it’s what comprises the template that tells you who you are. After you dis-
cover that, existentialists want you to make choices by using the right proce-
dure; that procedure involves making choices, and living, in a way that 
accurately represents your existential situation.
The central truth about who you 
are: Humans are absurd beings
If one central fact explains who or what we are, it’s the fact that we’re fully 
absurd beings. We exist in the world in a fundamentally different way from 
other things. Rocks and chairs just sit there and take up space, and that’s 
really all that defines their existence. Your existence involves more than that. 
You live in the world; you take on various plans and projects. Some people 
choose this path in life; others choose another. But the world that you exist 
in is indifferent to the paths that you choose. There’s no reason in the world 
why this rather than that path is ultimately the right one to take. You have to 
take full responsibility for your choices.
Existence is absurd. It demands making choices (representing yourself 
through living), but you have no choice but to do so in a universe that pro-
vides no foundation for those choices.
 
That’s who we are. It’s written into us in a much more fundamental way than 
our genes or our personality could ever be. As Thomas Hobbes (who wasn’t 
an existentialist but who did seem to get this part right!) once put it, “The priv-
ilege of absurdity: to which no living creature is subject, but man only.”

96
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
And that’s exactly what the existentialists want you to embrace — that absur-
dity is your lot and that you shouldn’t have it any other way. The only way to 
deny this fact, to see life as not absurd, is to live inauthentically. But that 
means rejecting your own nature as a free, individual being. Why do that? 
The existentialists think facing up to yourself is preferable. Human existence 
may include having a personality or having a certain genetic code or biology, 
but it’s really defined by your way of existing in the world as an absurd crea-
ture. That can’t be changed without fundamentally altering the human race 
and making everyone into something radically different — an object.
The many truths of your absurd nature
Being authentic means making choices, or representing yourself in the world, 
in a way that follows from the right procedure. Part of that means to reflect 
your absurdity in the ways that you approach life (we talk more about that in 
the next section). But the existentialists say that being absurd actually means 
that other facts are true about your nature because they’re either required 
for, or follow from, absurd existence. So being authentic means understand-
ing all the basic truths that flow from your absurdity and embracing them in 
the way that you live your life.
Given that these basic truths are covered in more detail in Part III of this 
book, we just quickly survey each of them here. If your choices fail in some 
way to represent even one of these truths, your way of existing in the world 
is fake or artificial. You’re as counterfeit as a $3 bill! Your job, according to 
the existentialists: represent accurately all these facts about yourself in your 
way of living.
Absurd existence takes place in the world
Absurd beings have a unique relationship to the world. For one, what we are 
requires that we exist in a world. The fact that our existence must take place 
in the world means that we’re always faced with the continual task of repre-
senting ourselves by giving meaning to our own lives and to that world we 
exist within.
At the same time, your way of existing in the world isn’t determined by the 
way the world is; it’s for this reason that the world is indifferent to your 
choices. If the world did determine who you were, you’d have all the reason 
to be one way and not another (you’d lack free will, though!). Thus, without 
this unique relationship to the world, you wouldn’t be absurd. So although 
being in a world is fundamental to you, you’re not just another object in the 
world. You’re different from rocks and chairs. Part of existing means taking a 
free position or stance on how to position yourself within the world (we talk 
about this in Chapter 6).

97
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Absurd existence is passionate
Unlike rocks and chairs, which can’t represent themselves in the world, we 
care deeply about how we represent ourselves and the world around us. As a 
result, human life must be passionate. Living in an authentic way means 
taking seriously your capacity for making decisions about how to live life. 
Living authentically requires making decisive commitments about how to 
forge your own individual path through life. Living in an uncommitted way is 
to forfeit the gift of your unique kind of existence and to live in the way that 
rocks and chairs and even animals must. It’s living in an undignified way (we 
talk more about this in Chapter 7).
Absurd existence is free
We’re free; no constraints or meanings inside the world dictate to us how we 
ought to live. The matter of what you do is always up to you. People may 
attempt to continually make excuses for their choices by attributing power to 
things or meanings they see as external to them. But an authentic existence 
within an absurd world reflects the fact that you always choose who you 
want to be, because meanings seen to be in the world are ultimately without 
foundation. Your way of existing in the world is always up to you (although 
this idea is discussed throughout the book, we give it special treatment in 
Chapter 8).
Absurd existence is individual
Given the way that you’re immersed in the world — seeing the world from 
the inside out — you unavoidably have a very particular perspective or point 
of view, a way of interacting with the world that you may share with others, 
but that’s fundamentally unique to you. Consequently, to embrace your 
choices in an individual way means striving to reflect your uniquely experi-
enced world within your specific way of living.
Specifically, an authentic person represents himself in a way that reflects the 
fact that he’s more than the mere sum of his parts. So even if you’re part of a 
community or part of a world, the existentialists hold that as a uniquely indi-
vidual thing, what you are is always more than just that. Individual existence 
succeeds in standing out (we discuss two ways of understanding this task, 
one religious and one atheistic, in Chapter 10 and 11, respectively).
Absurd existence is finite
We don’t live forever. We’re finite; our existence in the world has temporal 
limitations. You’re born at a particular time, and at some point in the future, 
it’s certain that you’ll die. Your nature as an absurd being relies on this fact. 
Thus, some existentialists argue that the choices you make in life must reflect 
your continual awareness of your unique past — and how it functions as the 
background for your ways of understanding yourself and your choices. At the 

98
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
same time, many argue that authentic living must also reflect your conscious-
ness of the inevitability of your own impending death (we tackle this topic at 
length in Chapter 9).
Absurd existence is social
Absurd creatures, living in the particular world that they inhabit, are forced 
to come to the realization that they aren’t alone. Absurd creatures don’t live 
in a world populated only with inanimate chairs and rocks, but in a world 
populated with other entities for which these existential truths also apply. 
The fact that other absurd creatures are in your world, existing in just the 
same way that you are, means making choices in certain ways.
Authenticity 102: Living Inauthentically 
Means Running Away
Although existentialists claim that life has no inherent meaning, they all 
divide ways of living into authentic versus inauthentic. Someone living inau-
thentically refuses to accept the basic fact that life is absurd. Different exis-
tentialists have different ways of talking about this situation, but it all comes 
down to a kind of dishonesty. The truth is that life is absurd — people want 
to find order and meaning, but there is none. If you live inauthentically, you 
refuse to accept this basic truth, and this, the existentialists say, is dishonest.
However, although all the existentialists view authenticity as a form of 
strength or health and inauthenticity as a kind of weakness, they don’t agree 
as a group about whether living the authentic life is better than living the 
inauthentic life. Some of them think that an existentialist shouldn’t claim 
that authentic living is better. As a result, some existentialists take other exis-
tentialists to task for claiming, as far as they can tell, that authenticity is 
better, or of more value, than inauthenticity. Sartre, for example, thinks that 
Heidegger’s notion of inauthenticity is evaluatively loaded. Heidegger insists 
that it isn’t and for his own part argued that Sartre’s notion of bad faith (his 
version of inauthenticity) is judgmental. Sartre insisted that it isn’t. When you 
read the existentialists, however, it’s tough to get away from the idea that 
authenticity is in fact to be preferred.
From one perspective, it’s hard to imagine why anyone would fail to be 
authentic. People love authenticity. They want to see it in everyone around 
them. It’s hard to imagine people who would honestly argue that it’s not 
important to them. Can you imagine someone who champions being fake, 
someone who argues for the importance of not being who you are? Still, 
according to the existentialists, most people are not authentic. Why not? 

99
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Because it’s hard to do. Existentialists tend to agree that authenticity causes 
a lot of personal discomfort, and for the most part, human beings tend to 
want to take the easy path in life.
Table 5-1 lists some of the terms the different existentialists use to distin-
guish between authentic and inauthentic ways of living.

Inauthentic people take the 
path of least resistance
According to the existentialists, most of the time when people fall into being 
inauthentic or fail to be true to themselves, it’s not because they want to be 
inauthentic (as we said before, people do crave authenticity), but because 
it’s hard to be authentic and because, frankly, it’s so easy to be inauthentic. It 
just works that way. It’s a fact of life!
So why are people driven away from authenticity if they crave it so deeply? If 
a person craves X but chooses Y instead, you have reason to think that Y is a 
more powerful motivator than X on that person’s behavior. In this case, exis-
tentialists may suggest that if you’re driven away from authenticity, some-
thing must be discomforting about it. Well, that’s true! Consider the 
following:
 
 Pursuing authenticity is difficult because it
 
• Requires relentless self-examination
 
• Exposes you to things about yourself that you may not want 
to know

100
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
• Simply causes friction with others
 
 In short, authenticity hurts! But this isn’t enough. In addition, a person 
needs to make a choice.
 
 If you’re driven away from authenticity, you choose the avoidance 
of discomfort over your own desire for the admirable status of 
authenticity.
Existentialists are united on this point: Inauthentic people just can’t hack dis-
comfort, and they strive to avoid it at all costs. The more inauthentic a 
person is, the more prevalent his desire to avoid discomfort. Instead of being 
themselves, inauthentic people want to avoid the normal friction of everyday 
life that being themselves just naturally brings. They avoid self-examination, 
they lie to themselves, and they tend to rationalize their own behavior. The 
path of least resistance doesn’t lead to authenticity. If inauthentic people 
have a motto, it’s this one: Ignorance is bliss.
These motives for acting inauthentically actually reveal a little more about what 
makes people crave authenticity. It’s not just that living authentically means 
living in accord with the person you are; living authentically also seems to 
require mastering yourself so that you don’t give in to your baser desires to 
escape discomfort (at least when it’s inappropriate to do so). Giving in to desires 
seems to indicate a lack of control, whereas an authentic person appears to be in 
control; he doesn’t let desire for comfort or pleasure rule living.
In practice, people usually deny the truth by running away. When they can’t 
face the fact that life is absurd, they find a way to hide or escape from that 
fact. The thought that life is meaningless, despite how much you yearn for 
meaning, can be scary. It’s not surprising, then, that many, perhaps most, 
people respond in a way that existentialists would call inauthentic. As Camus 
points out, people can respond inauthentically in two ways. The most 
extreme method is to commit suicide. This response may not be common, 
but the existentialists take it very seriously. Less dramatically, people can 
deny absurdity by putting their faith in systems — philosophical, religious, or 
scientific — that cover up or explain away the absurdity of existence.
Suicide is not the answer
Suicide may actually seem like a rational and authentic response to honestly 
facing the absurdity of life and finding it unacceptable. Perhaps the most 
authentic response to absurdity is to not participate in worldly tasks at all! As 
it turns out, however, existentialists aren’t in favor of suicide.

101
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Some people may argue that the most genuine response is a specific kind of 
global disengagement — actual suicide. After all, recognizing the truth of the 
absurdity of human existence can be disquieting. It can certainly throw you 
for a serious loop. Surely you didn’t think life was meant to be this way 
(that’s part of what makes it so darn absurd; it’s like spending your life trying 
to put a square peg in a round hole). You were sold a false bill of goods; you 
thought you fit in the world, that in some way you were playing a big, mean-
ingful role in some large scheme, maybe even in the creation of something 
bigger or better than yourself.
If life just isn’t worth living if it’s absurd, suicide may seem like an authentic 
response. If absurdity is actually true of humanity, but it’s an affront to the 
dignity of human life, some may argue that suicide may be the right way to 
go. You may think that by committing suicide, people accept that the truth of 
human life is absurdity, but they refuse to will (or embrace) the absurd life 
by choosing its continuance (through living it).
According to the existentialists, suicide doesn’t really represent absurdity 
because representing something fully, or embracing it, involves accepting it 
as a whole being. The suicide acknowledges absurdity only partially and also 
partially rejects it, and thus isn’t embracing the absurd.
The accepting part is purely intellectual. I see that absurdity is a truth about 
me. But I dare not face it as a matter of will. Instead, I avoid absurdity in its 
fullest sense by ceasing its continuance through death. The fact that this isn’t 
enough to represent the absurd shows that the existentialists believe you can 
discover a truth about humans here, namely:
Melville’s Bartleby: Accepting, 
but not willing, absurdity
A wonderful short story, Herman Melville’s 
Bartleby the Scrivener (1853) is a favorite of the 
existential (or absurdist) minded. The story tells 
about a young 19th-century Wall Street copyist 
named Bartleby. As the story goes on, Bartleby 
becomes more and more strange, slowly opting 
out of daily tasks by responding, “I would prefer 
not to.” Bartleby’s refusals take on more and 
more serious consequences, as he loses his 
job, becomes homeless, and then finally dies 
because he “prefers not to” eat. Although an 
explanation of Bartleby’s behavior is disputed, 
one reason hinted at in the end is that Bartleby 
has glimpsed the absurdity of human living. He 
never recovers, and as the story goes on, he 
loses his ability to partake in any human 
endeavor whatsoever, with tragic circum-
stances. For Camus, Bartleby would have 
accepted absurdity but not embraced it through 
his will.

 We are, in part, thinking, intellectual creatures.
 
 We are also, in part, willing creatures.
If both of these parts are necessary, you can’t claim to embrace or accept 
the truth of absurdity by merely recognizing it on an intellectual level. That 
leaves out willing, which is also an essential part of what you are. To embrace 
something is to embody it in all you are. In this case, part of willing absurdity 
is to will its continuation through your continued absurd life!
Suicide fails to be absurd. Suicide acknowledges absurdity but refuses to fully 
embody it, so it doesn’t fully accept absurdity. As a result, a person choosing 
suicide is misrepresenting who he is; he presents himself as not-absurd (by 
choosing to die in the face of the indignity of his nature) when that isn’t what 
he is. As a result, suicide can’t be authentic. True authenticity must see the 
truth of human existence and will that truth through continued life. Only 
such a way of being absurd is authentic.
Covering up the truth won’t save you
 
 The important thing is not to be cured . . . but to live with one’s ailments.
—Albert Camus, “The Myth of Sisyphus”
Merely living doesn’t automatically mean someone has willed, or embraced, 
the absurd. People often see absurdity and continue to live, but only on the 
grounds that the absurdity they see is somehow (or in some way) denied. To 
them, the world seems absurd, but there’s a mysterious divine plan. Or 
maybe they believe this world is absurd, but an ordered, rational world is 
waiting for them after they depart this one. Or perhaps they say that the 
world seems absurd, but only because science hasn’t finished providing all 
the answers.
Camus calls all such denials philosophical (as opposed to physical) suicide. 
It’s philosophical because it uses fictions and illusions to hide the fact that 
life is actually absurd. It’s suicide because, like physical suicide, it denies or 
renounces life as it actually exists. Religion, science, and many philosophies 
typically provide reasons and plans for the universe so that its irrational 
character is removed. That has the comforting effect of making the apparent 
absurdity of your situation into the illusion. But this kind of comfort prevents 
people from living authentically, because it misrepresents who they are.
 
In “The Myth of Sisyphus,” Camus says, “[T]he doctrines that explain every-
thing to me also debilitate me at the same time. They relieve me of the weight 
of my own life, and yet I must carry it alone.” For existentialists, then, philo-
sophical and physical suicide are both ways of running from the true absur-
dity of life.

103
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Embracing Absurdity: “The 
Myth of Sisyphus”
In his most famous philosophical essay, Camus uses a guy named Sisyphus to 
vividly illustrate the life of absurdity and what he feels is the proper reaction 
to it. Sisyphus is a man in a horribly absurd situation who overcomes it 
through embracing that situation. Embracing the situation requires a special 
approach that makes him a fitting role model. Through a special kind of 
rebellion, he’s able to reject certain aspects of his situation while staying true 
to who and what he is.
Sisyphus and his punishment
Sisyphus is a hero in Greek mythology. He’s famous for being punished by 
the gods, condemned to roll a huge boulder up a hill for all eternity. He rolls 
this heavy boulder up the hill; then it comes back down, and he starts all 
over again. All his work is aimed at doing a job that’s doubly pointless.
First, it’s pointless because rolling a boulder up a hill is meaningless in 
itself. Who cares whether the boulder is at the top or the bottom of the hill? 
Perhaps you can imagine special circumstances in which it might matter — 
maybe if Sisyphus were a landscaper building a Japanese rock garden, for 
example. But, in itself, it’s meaningless. On top of this, of course, is the fact 
that the rock comes back down, and he has to start all over again. The task is 
never completed.
Camus, who had great respect for the troubles of the working class, com-
pares this situation to the plight of factory workers who do menial, repeti-
tious tasks all their lives, only to find at the end that they have nothing to 
show for it. But really, he thinks we’re all in Sisyphus’s predicament.
 
What we share with Sisyphus is our existential situation. If the world is really 
fundamentally without order, or irrational, all the importance (order!) you 
attach to all the things you do is pointless. All your projects, employments, 
and relationships — whatever you toil to accomplish or achieve — are as 
empty as rolling a boulder up a hill. The world just is; it has no inherent value.
So your existential situation is that you’re an absurd being, and you can’t 
escape this fact about how you’re related to the world around you.
The existential description of your situation can seem pretty bleak. You can 
see why the existentialists got a reputation for being real downers. They were 
famous for sitting in coffee shops, wearing black turtlenecks and chain-
smoking — not lounging on beaches, sipping fruity cocktails. Suffice it to say 

104
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
there’s a reason existentialists aren’t often invited to party at the Palms with 
Jenny McCarthy (Greg has tried and failed). For now, we just want to warn 
you against wrongly interpreting the existentialists. They actually see the 
absurdity of life as being no reason for being depressed at all — quite the 
opposite, actually.
 
What usually doesn’t get reported about the existentialists’ attitude is the 
twist they add: the optimistic side of their attitude. All the doom and gloom 
about the meaninglessness of life are just the beginning. This may be your 
existential situation, but Camus and the other existentialists don’t really think 
they’re saying anything profound or new by describing that situation. What’s 
important to existentialists, and where they feel they have something to say, is 
in how you respond to this situation. The optimism of the existentialist 
response to absurdity can be seen in Camus’s description of Sisyphus’s 
response to his situation. For him, Sisyphus wasn’t just an example of a man 
struggling with absurdity, but a hero who overcomes and even conquers that 
absurdity.
Rebel without a cause . . . but a smile
 
 
 Rebellion cannot exist without the feeling that, somewhere and 
somehow, one is right.
—Albert Camus, The Rebel
Sisyphus is a bit of a rebel. He defies the gods on multiple occasions and is 
particularly fond of tricking death. In one instance, he’s said to have actually 
put death in chains. So Sisyphus doesn’t just defy the gods; he also rebels 
against death itself. Rebellion is very important to Camus. Sisyphus is a rebel 
and has an attitude both in life and in death. Now, understandably, it’s hard 
to have an attitude and be a rebel when you’re pushing a heavy boulder up a 
hill. You’re too busy sweating! Similarly, most people don’t have time for exis-
tential concerns while they’re scrambling to meet deadlines or get the kids 
into the minivan.
For Camus, Sisyphus’s situation gets interesting when he’s at the top of the 
hill, the boulder rolls back down, and he starts to go back down to do it all 
again. At this point, he has a choice. Should he give in to despair? Should he 
let the gods win and mope over his eternal fate? Or should he thumb his nose 
at them, embrace this meaningless task, and refuse to see it as a punishment? 
For Camus, Sisyphus’s scorn saves him. He overcomes his situation because 
he stands in revolt of it. Sisyphus is a rebel, and because of this, Camus is 
convinced that you have to imagine him smiling as he walks down that hill.

105
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
What it means to be a rebel
A rebel is someone who refuses to surrender. In The Rebel, Camus explains 
the difference between a rebel and someone who simply renounces his situa-
tion. Renunciation is a form of surrender. A rebel, on the other hand, draws a 
line in the sand; says, “This far, and no farther”; and stands up to defend that 
line. You’ve probably known people who complain about their jobs or their 
lives constantly but do nothing, or can do nothing, to change their situation. 
They belittle their situation and themselves for living in it. They’re in despair 
because they refuse to either accept their situation or act against it. They’ve 
simply surrendered. You probably know others, however, who hold their 
heads up proudly and refuse to be defeated. They declare that something is 
unjust in their situation and that they deserve better treatment — that it’s 
their right.
So being a rebel really has two parts, a yes and a no:
 
 No: The rebel rejects something as an unacceptable intrusion upon his 
rights.
 
 Yes: The rebel asserts himself as someone who has value, as someone 
who has a claim to these rights, and as someone who can judge the situ-
ation as unjust.
For Camus, you can’t be a rebel unless you stand for something, something 
you believe others should accept. Screaming at the cop and saying, “You 
can’t do this! I don’t like being in handcuffs!” isn’t enough. A rebel asserts 
that something is unjust, something is wrong with the situation — “You can’t 
do this; I have my rights!” By asserting rights, the rebel is asserting the exis-
tence of a value.
So when Sisyphus rebels against the gods, when he walks down the mountain 
feeling scorn for their sentence, he’s also doing these two things: rejecting 
and asserting. What, then, is he rejecting? The gods expect that the best 
Sisyphus can do is to acknowledge his fate but feel resignation as a result, to 
hate what his life is. That’s where the punishment lies.
The gods assume that only labor or work that has meaning outside itself, 
only labor that fits into a larger scheme of things, is dignified work. Outside 
serving as a punishment, Sisyphus’s labor has no larger meaning. That’s the 
whole point: It’s meaningless! As such, the rock-rolling is meant to trap him 
for all eternity in a life that has no dignity at all. Thus, according to the gods, 
resignation is the best he can muster; as a matter of fact, the more resigned 
he is, the more intense the punishment is.

106
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
But Sisyphus rejects this entire construction of the situation. He rebels 
against the gods’ assertions that his task must be meaningless and that his 
only response is despair. He accepts his task as being inherently meaning-
less, but he refuses to let it remain so. He refuses to give in to resignation.
Sisyphus rejects
 
 The gods’ view of his situation
 
 That his situation is incurably meaningless
 
 Resignation and surrender
Instead, he revolts, and in defiance of all that is, he asserts his own worth and 
the worth of his task. He lives for the challenge, for the struggle, when there 
is nothing else. Sisyphus, in his scorn, asserts himself as a being capable of 
judging, of deciding, of valuing, of creating. Although he rejects the gods and 
their punishment, he asserts his own dignity and value. At the same time, he 
chooses to embrace his situation and his task. He gives them value not 
because they have it inherently or because the gods conferred it, but 
because he, Sisyphus, willed them to have it.
He can’t change his situation, but through an act of will, he re-creates what it 
means and what it’s worth to him. In a real sense, Sisyphus takes full respon-
sibility for his life. He embraces absurdity by embracing what is and making 
it his own. Thus, rolling the rock up and down the hill when nothing will 
come of it doesn’t rob him of his life; it actually gives him his life. His rock is, 
as Camus told us, “his thing,” and Sisyphus is the one who made it so.
Rebels stand for something
Everyone loves a rebel. But if all you do is drink 
and smoke, listen to punk rock, or drive a Harley, 
what kind of statement are you making? 
Nietzsche once said, “Don’t tell me what you’re 
running from, tell me: what are you running to?” 
A real rebel stands for something, wants to 
build something. Gandhi stood up to the British 
and stood for the sanctity of life and the effec-
tiveness of nonviolence. The Rev. Martin Luther 
King Jr. stood up against racial injustice and 
oppression, but he also stood for a dream of 
racial harmony and a United States that stood 
by the values expressed in the Declaration of 
Independence. True rebels, it seems, aren’t 
merely negative; they also express positive 
ideals. Gandhi and King weren’t necessarily 
existentialist rebels, but existentialist rebels 
share their penchant for asserting values.

107
 Chapter 5: The Challenge of Absurdity and Authenticity
Sisyphus asserts
 
 The value of his life
 
 The meaningfulness of his task, his rock, and the endless struggle itself
 
 His own worth and dignity as a human being
 
 His ability to judge these things and make them matter through an act of 
will
Rebellion can give life meaning
So why is Sisyphus smiling? Simple: He has a meaningful life. He recognizes 
his own value and the value of the actions that make up his life. It wasn’t 
given to him that way, but he embraces his life for what it is, embraces even 
the absurdity of it, and dives into it as something he has made his own. And 
he does so without any inauthenticity. This is what makes the rock, and his 
task, truly his. He’s living the life he chose, the life he created. Isn’t that what 
everyone wants? You may say, “Hey, wait a second; he didn’t choose that!” 
But in a sense, he did. He didn’t choose to be punished for all eternity, but in 
his rebellion, he chose what it means.
 
No gods have condemned you to live this way. But death cruelly conveys 
meaninglessness onto everyone’s projects. Camus thinks that you, like 
Sisyphus, can rebel against death. Don’t expect an extra 20 years, but if you 
reject death and embrace your projects despite the meaninglessness death 
confers upon them, you embrace life and give it a value and even a kind of 
meaning. This is the meaning and the end to embracing the absurd and living 
authentically.

n Part II, our focus is on the themes that describe the 
problems the existentialists see themselves as address-
ing. This part covers the existentialists’ responses to these 
problems. Taken as a whole, it presents a “how-to” manual 
of existential living. It clarifies the concerns that form the 
core of what existentialism is all about. The existentialists 
aren’t big on final solutions, but they do generally agree 
that there’s hope and that human beings can find a way 
forward.
Part III presents what the existentialists see as the way 
forward, the way to deal with the absurdity the world-
confronts us with. Each chapter develops a different 
existential theme, a different component of that way for-
ward, primarily through the lens of one existentialist’s 
philosophy. Don’t consider these discussions the final 
word of the existentialists as a group on that topic, but 
you get an idea of why each of these themes is important 
and how at least one existentialist develops that theme.

Understanding Our Unique Way 
of Existing in the World
In This Chapter
 Surveying different ways to think about existence
 Investigating how you’re connected to the world
 Understanding who and what you are
I
n this chapter, we talk about the meaning of human existence by analyzing 
Martin Heidegger’s central existential work, Being and Time (1920). To 
crack the question “What is the meaning of human existence?” you have to 
look closely at what it means for you — the entity you are — to exist. What 
makes the uniqueness of human life possible?
Look closely at what it means to engage in life. Existentialists such as 
Heidegger point out that the proper method of understanding life isn’t scien-
tific because science looks at things from the outside, and you can understand 
life only from within. As a result, they propose using the phenomenological 
method, a way of investigating life from the inside.
We explain that existentialists such as Heidegger see life as grounded in an 
intimate immersion in the world. That means understanding the meaning of 
existence requires acknowledging the ways in which we’re immersed in activ-
ity within the human worlds of significance that we occupy.
We end with a problem that arises from this description of life. Namely, we 
ask, “Where are you in all that immersion within the social and human world? 
Where’s the individual?” In response, Heidegger points out that your basic, 
most fundamental way of living isn’t as an “I” but as a “They.” Basic, everyday 
living is a mirroring of the group or social climate that you live in. This doesn’t 
mean that it’s the only way for you to live; you can be authentic within life 
and express your individuality. But you need to first realize that your basic, 
normal mode of existing is what Heidegger calls “fallen” — existing in the 
world as a “They.”

112
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Different Ways to Investigate Existence
Heidegger was interested in the really big questions, like “What’s the meaning 
of existence?” Yeah, that’s big! To investigate it, Heidegger thinks you need to 
look closely at the particular mode of existence of specific beings — namely, 
beings just like you.
To investigate your own existence, start by recognizing that the capacity to 
ask questions about your own existence is unique to your way of being. Who 
and what you are matter to you. You participate in life in a way that no other 
being can. You wonder, you ponder, you ask questions about living. What 
does it mean that you can do that? What are you? What’s the structure of the 
kind of life that defines you?
If you want to investigate life, you need a method. But how do you dig into 
the nature of life itself? Science seems like the wrong method, because it 
wants to examine life from the outside. It can’t grasp what it means to 
wonder about and question existence — to actually experience living. 
Instead, Heidegger argues you need to analyze your existence — or participa-
tion in life — from the inside and try to understand its meaning from that 
insider’s perspective.
Investigating the meaning of existence
Of all of the big questions, perhaps none is bigger than “What is the meaning 
of existence?” If you think about it, things are, a fact that’s actually pretty 
darn amazing. Why isn’t there nothing instead? Existence is pretty cool!
According to existential thinkers such as Heidegger, it’s helpful to start by 
clarifying exactly what you want to investigate. To begin, note the different 
ways to talk about existing. As Heidegger puts it, you can ask about the 
nature of existence, or you can ask about the nature of beings. As he sees it, 
the difference involves the following:
 
 When you talk about beings, you mean things that exist. Cats, tables, 
chairs, you — these are all beings, not existence itself.
 
 When you talk about existence, you mean the mysterious fact that a 
being shows up or makes an appearance at all. Existence isn’t itself a 
being.
Heidegger wants you to look at existence itself. Unfortunately, Heidegger thinks 
that most people have forgotten the question or left it behind. You may forget 
the question for lots of reasons. Perhaps you take the answer to be obvious 
(what’s more obvious, you think, than the meaning of is?). Perhaps you blow 
the question off, suggesting that it’s just plain unintelligible or silly.

113
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
Heidegger thinks that sometimes, people forget the question by mistaking 
questions about existence with questions about beings; they get things all 
mixed up, confusing what he calls ontic investigations (into the nature of 
beings) with ontological investigations (into existence).
Heidegger thinks you need to reinvestigate the mystery at the heart of 
things — existence. Now you just need to know how to get started!
Knowing existence means knowing you
Asking about existence is about as abstract as you can get. So how can you 
gain access to the issue? Heidegger thinks that you have to inquire about 
existence through an investigation of the existence of a particular kind of 
being. The best being to pick, he argues, is one just like you!
Why investigate a being to investigate existence itself? Can’t you just deal 
with big, hard-to-grasp abstractions? Fortunately, no! Heidegger says, “Being 
is always the Being of an entity.” What he means is that if you want to think 
about existence (being), you have to think about the existence of something 
that already exists. In a way, that’s where existence is going on. Beings get 
you access to existence.
 
So what being should you use to investigate existence? A beer mug? Well . . . 
that’s not the best route. Heidegger thinks it helpful to investigate a being 
whose existence is defined by the fact that it questions its own existence. 
You’re that being. You engage with your existence. You wonder about it. You 
ask, “What kind of being should I be?” as though the way you exist is up to you.
This way of existing, which is unique to us, causes us a lot of anxiety because 
the Shakespearean question “To be or not to be?” is never settled. It’s always 
there, demanding to be reengaged again and again. It makes life painful, but 
at the same time it opens the possibility for the exhilaration or thrill of life 
that your beer mug, which can’t exist in this way, can never experience. The 
beer mug’s existence doesn’t include that kind of possibility (well, not our 
beer mugs, anyway!).
Why does investigating your type of existence help you? Why does it matter 
that you ask questions about life? Heidegger has his reasons. He says:
 
1. You ask questions about existence.
 
2. Asking questions about existence involves understanding existence on 
some level.
 
3. So in the way that you engage with life by questioning it, you must 
already understand existence on some basic level.

114
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Heidegger’s reasoning here is interesting. He thinks if you ask a question like 
“What is existence?” or “What does it mean for me to be?” you already have 
an understanding, on some level, of the meaning of is (is is in the question, 
isn’t it?). But is means existence! So to ask what existence is already means 
being acquainted with the answer in some way to start.
With this insight in mind, Heidegger proposes that if you can investigate the 
very way in which you exist as the specific being you are — the fact that you 
wonder and question what to be — you may come to know a bit more about 
existence as a whole, or at least get some clues about it.
 
You want to investigate what it means for beings like you to experience life in 
the way that you do. After all, that’s what life is — being engaged with what’s 
around you, wondering about it, and asking lots of questions; directing your 
life one way or another; or being anxious; or being exhilarated. Life is trying to 
figure out how to situate yourself or how to be. It’s hard work, but it’s your 
inescapably existential duty and obligation.
So to investigate the meaning of your existence, look under the hood, and try 
to see how this sort of life runs and ticks. Not many questions are more exis-
tential than that!
Science: Analyzing life from the outside
If you want to ask about life, you first need a method to use to investigate it. 
The existentialists tend to be united on one point: The scientific method 
doesn’t work well here, because it’s committed to analyzing things from the 
outside, from a distanced perspective. Thinking about life from the outside, 
however, just seems to look at life the wrong way.
Don’t get us wrong — we’re not hating on science. We love science! In fact, 
science is clearly a very valuable method of investigation. Without science, 
you wouldn’t have an iPod, and you’d have to walk to work because you 
wouldn’t have a car. One of the reasons science is so effective, frankly, is 
because it analyzes things in a detached way. Science prides itself on learning 
about things from an impartial and unbiased point of view, and that view 
works when you care about technological advancement.
But that’s not the best method of investigation for all inquiries. How does sci-
ence approach the questions “What does life mean?” and “What makes life pos-
sible?” Open any science textbook that deals with humans, and take a look. 
What does it say? Lots of things: that humans are mammals, that humans are 
homo sapiens, that people have specific sequences of DNA, that the brain is 
composed of neurons. That sort of thing. That’s what human life — as it’s stud-
ied by biology from the detached perspective — turns out to be.

115
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
 
But when you pose the question about the meaning of life, is that the kind of 
response you’re looking for? When you ask, “What makes life possible?” or 
“What does it all mean?” does the biology text help you out?
No doubt you get the unmistakable feeling that this is fundamentally the 
wrong kind of response. If you’ve read the book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the 
Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, you’ll remember that a bunch of mice build a 
supercomputer to figure out “the answer to life, the universe, and every-
thing.” After billions of years, it gives its answer: 42. It’s funny, but why? It’s 
not 42 that you’re laughing at (well, maybe you are a bit). Instead, you’re 
likely laughing at the fact that the scientific language of the answer just 
doesn’t fit the personal language of the question.
Life, as a way of existing, can’t be analyzed from the outside. Life isn’t biologi-
cal life; neither is it chemical life or life as understood by physics. It’s experi-
enced life. Try as it might, science just can’t grasp that. It can’t address what 
it means to ponder, question, and wonder. But you want to know what it 
means to be that kind of thing — what makes it all possible or what it means 
to exist as the kind of being you are. Whatever the answer, we know one 
thing: Life won’t be illuminated at all for us by talk of atoms or chemicals or 
neurons . . . or the number 42.
Viewing life from the inside out
Science doesn’t do a good job of explaining life because scientific investiga-
tions are too impersonal. To get at the more personal dimension of life, you 
need a method that can analyze the actual experience that is life. You need a 
method that can get on the inside of the experience of life and analyze it from 
there.
Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) thought that he had just such a method. 
According to Husserl, to really understand the sort of life particular to human 
beings, you have to be a human being. You need to actually be an experienc-
ing entity to get a grasp on what it means to experience and exist in a human 
way. In fact, this idea seems right. No matter how many scientific facts you 
accumulate about humans, you never get much of a clue about what it means 
to actually live or exist in the sense that you want to investigate.
 
Husserl proposed a method called phenomenology to rigorously study the 
actual insider’s experience of living or existing. Phenomenology is a big word, 
but it’s easy to understand. It breaks down into two Greek terms, phenome-
non, which means to appear, and logos, which means to make sense of or to 
give an account of something. So phenomenology means to make sense of (or 
explain) what appears as you experience life from the inside.

116
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
The phenomenologist tries to pay close attention to how things look from the 
first-person point of view because that first-person point of view is so integral 
to what it means for you to exist. From there, the phenomenologist can ana-
lyze what appears to determine what makes the phenomena possible. The 
existentialist hopes that you can use phenomenology to gain access to impor-
tant clues about the actual structure of life.
Living in Your Everyday World
Existentialists think that understanding what it means to exist as a human 
being is important. As we discuss in the preceding section, this exploration 
requires analyzing the experience of life as it looks from the inside of a being 
who experiences life as you do. In this section, we look at what Heidegger 
claims to find in his analysis of the phenomenon of human life and what 
makes your unique way of existing possible.
Heidegger’s first claim is that our existence is what he calls a being-in-the-
world, a very deep and intimate way of being connected to your environment. 
We take apart the phrase being-in-the-world:
 
 Look at Heidegger’s claim that being connected (or being-in) from an 
existential point of view means being involved and committed to a world 
through concerns and goals. All these ways of being disposed toward 
the world are ways of responding to the question of what it means to be 
or to exist.
 
 Consider world to better understand what your concern is immersed 
within or about. In other words, what’s the context within which you ask 
about your own existence? Heidegger’s answer is that life takes place in 
What’s it like to be a bat?
In 1974, Thomas Nagel, a philosopher who stud-
ies the mind, posited an interesting thought 
experiment. What if, he wondered, you knew 
everything there was to know about the physical 
scientific facts involved when a bat uses echo-
location? In such a scenario, he asked, would 
you know what it was like to use echolocation? 
Nagel’s answer was no — that the actual expe-
rience specific to bat life couldn’t be fully 
reduced to the sorts of facts that science col-
lects, even if it had them all to study.
Think about it. If you agree with Nagel’s conclu-
sion, it seems to suggest that what it’s like for you 
to exist, experience the world, or participate in 
life can’t be understood from the outside through 
scientific investigation. Instead, because know-
ing what it’s like to be a bat would require being a 
bat, you have to take seriously the actual inside 
experiences of the human being. Knowing what 
it’s like to participate in human life requires look-
ing at human life from the inside and seeing how 
it ticks on its own terms.

social worlds; only within social environments is the human kind of exis-
tence possible. Worlds provide the kind of languages needed to interact 
with existence in the way you do.
 
 Connect being-in to the existential notion of world. According to 
Heidegger, being in-the-world always means engaging with life through a 
participation with your projects and goals. Heidegger argues that this is 
accomplished through seeing and responding to the particular social 
worlds we find ourselves within in terms of the tools that those social 
worlds provide and are composed of. From Heidegger’s perspective, 
your most basic relationship to life is not only social, but also practical 
and activity-oriented.
The nuts and bolts of your life
Existentialists are centrally concerned with understanding what it means to 
live the kind of existence you do. Time to start investigating. When you think 
of life, what are the most basic components or parts? When you pay attention 
to it as a whole, what does life always seem to involve? For Heidegger, the 
most basic answer is that human life is a way of being-in-the-world. Human 
life, he thinks, means always being radically situated somewhere, being 
directed or focused intimately on what’s around you.
The notion of being-in-the-world
Heidegger really loves hyphens. Seriously. He absolutely loves to connect 
long strings of words with them. No, he isn’t grammatically deranged. He 
actually has a philosophical reason: He thinks that the hyphens draw atten-
tion to certain features of your basic existence. To see, compare these two 
ways of expressing this:
 
 Being in the world
 
 Being-in-the-world
In the first item, the grammar implies that being and the world are separate 
things connected by the word in. This implies that a being can exist and then 
be put into a world. If that’s right, each of the two (being and world) can exist 
independently without the other. When thinking about human existence or 
human life, Heidegger strongly disagrees that this is possible.
 
Beings like us exist in a way that’s better described by being-in-the-world. The 
hyphenated connections imply that what’s connected by the dashes should 
actually be thought of as a unitary phenomenon. So you can’t exist first and 
then be put in the world, because for you to be in the first place implies being 
connected to the world in an intimate way. Your very way of existing is worldly.

Dasein: The notion of existing-there
At the simplest level, what does it mean to say that life, or your unique exis-
tence, is essentially worldly? For the existentialists, learning about life or 
existence is phenomenological (see the earlier section “Viewing life from the 
inside out” for more details). So you should be able to simply look closely at 
how experience looks or appears and try to generate some basic clues from 
there. Go ahead. Take a look at your experience. Don’t look at this or that 
particular experience. Instead, focus on what all your experiences seem to 
have in common. What basic features seem to always be present?
Well, at the core, living or being in-a-world always involves being situated in a 
context and a location. Human life is a being-somewhere!
 
Look around; test it out. It’s so obvious that you tend to miss it. At no time do 
you ever exist and then wind up in some situation, one that you then experi-
ence. Instead, an essential part of your existence is being situated. You always 
find yourself in the midst of this particular experience or that, one that has 
this history or that one, this cultural background as opposed to that one 
structuring it as significant, and so on.
 
Heidegger stresses this point by using the German word Dasein to name the 
kind of being that you are. In German, the term breaks into two parts: Da, 
which means there, and sein, which means to exist. Together — yup, here 
comes another hyphen! — Dasein means existing-there.
The fact that we understand this on some level is reflected when you ask 
someone, “How’s life?” You often mean “How are you situated lately?” People 
seem to acknowledge this basic, situated aspect of what they are (their exis-
tence). But you need to dig deeper into this notion of being essentially in-the-
world. In particular, look closer at what it may mean to be in something from 
the standpoint of human life. Specifically, what does it mean to say that life is 
a way of being intimately connected to the world?
Space, the final frontier of life
Life is always situated. Using Heidegger’s lingo, this means that one of the 
necessary aspects of Dasein (the kind of being you are) is being-in (the in 
part of being-in-the-world). The way Heidegger sees it, this means that space is 
central to existence and life. This is odd, because space is typically under-
stood scientifically, and existentialists don’t tend to understand human exis-
tence in scientific terms. So if an existentialist says space is essential to your 
existence, you can bet that there’s an existential way of being spatial or “in 
space.”

119
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
As Heidegger puts it, “Being-in is not a ‘property’ which Dasein sometimes 
has and sometimes does not have, and without which it could be just as well 
as it could with it.” Ah, those hyphens! There he goes again! Just remember 
that the hyphen means the things connected are inseparable. So if being-in is 
hyphenated, life always incorporates a dimension of “in-ness.” You don’t first 
exist and then wind up in a spatially defined situation.
 
Think about the ways you typically use spatial terms. You say that your car is 
in the parking lot, that the cars are all next to one another, that each car is 2 
feet from the one that is next to it. What you should notice, though, is that this 
way of talking is restricted to objects seen from an observer’s third-person 
point of view. For existentialists, people aren’t objects, so you must under-
stand your existence from the first-person point of view. You don’t understand 
life from the observer’s view, but the participator’s view.
As a result, you need a way of understanding how space corresponds to that 
kind of existing. You need a participatory, existential notion of space. Clearly, 
it doesn’t involve thinking in terms of maps or a ruler.
 
Does language give you any insight here? Yes! As it turns out, people often use 
spatial terms to imply a way of being concerned, involved, or immersed within 
relationships. You may say
 
 “Oh, she’s just in love.”
 
 “What’s she gotten herself into?”
 
 “So are you in or out?”
 
 “Why does she find it so hard to stand by her family when in need?”
The frequency with which you use this kind of language reveals an existential 
way of understanding space. After all, when you think of life, it makes sense. 
Life just seems inconceivable without paying close attention to involvement. 
Isn’t it fundamental to life? To be in stuff? To be up to things? When you think 
of pondering, defining yourself, or coming at life, the in of being-in-the-world 
is what’s being implicated. It implies that you’re always necessarily immersed 
with life. It matters to you. Because you’re in the world, those concerns or 
immersion take the form of participating with this or that plan, goal, role, or 
relationship.
 
Life is fundamentally spatial because you’re always touched by what’s around 
you in ways that matter to you. Some concerns are closer to you than others, 
whereas others seem more distant (or foreign) to you. It’s just what you are; 
you’re spatial through and through!

120
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Meaning: Life’s requirement
Heidegger thinks that existential living means being involved. It means being 
concerned with your existence and therefore being disposed toward the 
world around you in a way that highlights how things matter to you. But what 
makes such mattering possible? According to Heidegger, it requires that you 
reside in a world in which things around you have a significance. Residing in 
such a world is the foundation of existential life. Immersion in such a world 
allows your concerns and disposition toward existence to take concrete 
form. Because worlds are social in character, Heidegger’s point hints at a fur-
ther claim: that your existential existence depends upon the existence of 
others.
Consider these two different ways of talking about worlds:
 
 The collection of existing physical entities
 
 A shared social way of structuring experience so that your environment 
is revealed as significant and meaningful in a way that allows you to live 
an intelligible human life
As we discuss earlier in this chapter and throughout the book, many existen-
tialists, such as Heidegger, highlight how some words (such as in) can have a 
scientific meaning and an existential meaning. In the preceding list, the first 
use of world is clearly scientific. It means everything that physically exists. 
It’s the sum of everything. Existentialists prefer the second use of world 
because they want to understand life the way it’s experienced.
The second way of talking about the world hints at the fact that an existential 
world is a human world as opposed to the physical world. It’s like a large web 
or social language in which you can become immersed. Think of times you’ve 
said something like this:
 
 “When is she going to join the real world?”
 
 “What world are you living in to do something like that?”
 
 “Alas, the business world is just not for me.”
In each of these uses, you’re implying that actions and ways of responding to 
things take on different significance depending on the kind of language or 
world of meanings that the person is immersed within. Understanding behav-
ior as meaningful in a human sense, it seems, requires understanding the spe-
cific world that it arises from and that gives it meaning.
For example, to live “in the business world” is to experience, see, and 
respond to the environment (and the self) in the way that the social practitio-
ners of business do. Perhaps, for example, someone in the art world and 

121
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
someone in the business world would react to a painting differently, because 
one person experiences it as an aesthetic work and the other experiences it 
as a good investment. It isn’t “in truth” one or the other; the significance it 
takes on depends on the viewer’s world.
Life involves a way of being affected by (and responding to) things in your 
environment in ways that matter to you. It’s also a way of wrangling with the 
question “What does it mean to be?” Without worlds to exist in, these kinds 
of practical, meaningful, and highly existential engagements wouldn’t be pos-
sible. Worlds provide a context and a language for you to be — for you to 
participate meaningfully in life. Only within worlds can you grapple with 
choices about what to be.
 
This truth about the need for worlds reveals, in addition, an interesting fact. 
Because the worlds you live in are mostly not of your creation, to exist as a 
human being requires the existence of others. Meaningful existential life 
requires, Heidegger thinks, a world of social significance to exist within.
Life’s a workshop, and you need tools
Heidegger argues that your everyday life is activity. Being-in-the-world is 
essentially participating and acting in your environment in ways that embody 
the goals and plans that reflect your engagement with the question “What 
should I be?” This engagement is made possible, Heidegger argues, in the 
way that worlds reveal your environments to be filled with tools. In short, 
your worlds are just like workshops in which you respond to the question of 
your existence!
The activities of your workshop
Being involved, for Heidegger, isn’t a mere attitude. It’s a way of behaving. 
Involvement in life is practical. Your primary way of being immersed in-the-
world is through accomplishing plans and goals that you have. If you’re in 
the business world, you answer the question “What does it mean to be?” by 
defining yourself through projects that are meaningful in that world; if you’re 
in the art world, you define yourself differently, in terms of the projects, con-
cerns, goals, and roles that the art world makes available to you.
Being essentially practical, however, requires the use of tools that make par-
ticipating in your goals, projects, and roles possible. For Heidegger, this 
means that in a world, you experience your environment not as composed of 
objects that you see and then assign functions or uses to. Instead, you experi-
ence the world as composed of tools and functions. Each tool’s function is a 
part of the overall web of meanings that compose that world. Thus, being in a 
world means actively working toward goals made possible by that world, 
using the tools that world makes available to you.

122
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Tools versus meaningless objects: What’s in your workshop?
Heidegger claims that for a thing to “show up” in your experience (for you to 
notice it), you must experience it as meaningful in some way. To do this, you 
have to understand the thing through a particular world or system of social 
meanings. Cash registers, for example, exist in the world of commerce, and 
microscopes exist in the world of science. As Heidegger puts it, “an entity can 
‘meet up with’ Dasein only in so far as it can, of its own accord, show itself 
within a world.”
Heidegger’s favored examples are about carpentry. Suppose that you want to 
build a house. Doing so means defining yourself as a carpenter and residing 
within the social world of the carpenter. In turn, because activity defines you 
as a carpenter, the process of defining yourself is done through some active 
project (the building of the house). In your activity, you encounter things 
(they show up) natural to that world, and in terms of their uses and rele-
vance to your project. So you may encounter tools like hammers and nails 
(Heidegger says that people experience things primarily as ready-to-hand).
 
What the carpenter doesn’t see, Heidegger insists, are wooden things and iron 
things (what the hammers and nails are made of). Be careful — this point is a 
radical one that’s easy to misunderstand. People typically think that their 
experience is filled with meaningless things that they then react to by figuring 
out how to fit those things into their projects and goals. So you may think you 
see “iron thing” first and then interpret it as “nail.”
Because Heidegger thinks thought of existence (or life) as an essentially 
involved immersion within a world of meanings, he rejects this picture of 
how you interact with your environment. Instead, he argues that from the 
start, you’re involved with everything around you, seeing it as helpful or 
harmful to your way of engaging with your immediate goals and projects. You 
experience the world through your projects. As Heidegger puts it, you look 
around and see “the forest is a forest of timber, the mountain a quarry of 
rock, the river is water power, the wind is wind in the sails.”
 
Clearly, this sounds strange. But think about it and inspect your experience. 
Pay attention to how your experiences look (or feel). How do you experience 
the world? When you move around and operate within your local environ-
ment, don’t you simply respond to things in ways appropriate to the immedi-
ate task at hand? Don’t you see uses, not meaningless objects?
Doing without thinking: Look, no hands!
Heidegger says that your fundamental existence in the world is practical and 
active. You respond to your existence through an immersion within the 
world through projects. In fact, Heidegger says that you can get so immersed 
within the everyday world that you stop noticing the tools you’re using and 

123
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
instead see only the aim you’re focused on. During these times, you aren’t 
even conscious of yourself! So Heidegger’s point is that your everyday mode 
of existing is practical and not even explicitly self-conscious.
Hold on a second! How can you navigate your world if you aren’t self-
consciously directing yourself? Wouldn’t that imply arbitrary action? What 
would that look like? Nothing would make any sense! You’d be bumping into 
walls and making a fool out of yourself!
Many real cases actually seem to support what Heidegger is talking about 
while also dismissing these initial concerns. Think of a champion ice skater. 
How does she perform so many moves so quickly and effortlessly? The last 
thing she says is “I consciously directed my body during every part of that 
routine!” In fact, the more she thinks about what she’s doing, the less suc-
cessful she’ll be. Such complicated activity almost seems to require that you 
not think about it. It needs to just happen, in a way, to work.
Most of the time, isn’t this how you exist? Sure, you may not be doing triple 
axels, but you’re often doing everyday tasks and navigating your social and 
practical worlds in ways that are actually just as complex without explicit, 
conscious thought. In fact, it sure looks like most people aren’t consciously 
thinking about what they’re doing most of the time. Instead, they operate 
under a mode of awareness that Heidegger calls circumspection.
 
Here are some small examples of circumspection:
 
 When you need to get into your car, do you think “Ah, key. That goes 
here in the keyhole. Right. Now turn it. Ah, yes, and now open the door”? 
Or do you just seem to do it, fixed instead on your task — getting into the 
car? Circumspection, Heidegger thinks, allows you to do what’s appro-
priate to the task, given your environment. You see what tools around 
you are important (the key, door, keyhole), how they work, and how 
they relate to your task. In circumspection, you manipulate the world 
around you without thinking in light of your goals.
 
 Another example is language. After all, language is a tool, isn’t it? Most of 
the time when you’re speaking, do you have to think about how to make 
what you want to say come out in English? Or do you just speak, and out 
it comes, surprisingly correct? It’s as though the language becomes part 
of you. Well, you’ve embodied the tool of language, so you don’t need to 
notice it anymore. It’s as though you work through it.
The ability to use language appropriately without thinking is fluency. Regular 
tools in your environment often work in the same way for you. When you’re 
fluent in a world (say, the world of the carpenter), you can use the tools 
within that world in a way that allows them to disappear as you use them 
skillfully. They become transparent as you work through them.

124
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Oddly enough, Heidegger thinks that as this happens, you become transpar-
ent as well — just as much as the tool you’re using does. When you’re really 
immersed, nothing seems to exist but your goal. It’s like you’re in a trance. 
Sports players have a name for this: being in the zone. Through your goal, 
you’re tuned in to the world like a champion ice skater. You respond without 
thinking, even about yourself. You’re just doing. Weird!
Coming to Grips with Who You Are
Heidegger thinks that your existence is a being-in-the-world or a way of being 
intimately connected to the world. Check out the earlier section “Living in 
Your Everyday World” to see exactly what that means to Heidegger. For now, 
keep in mind that Heidegger notes that existing in-the-world means existing 
alongside others. Without them to structure and create the worlds you can 
live in, you couldn’t exist in a meaningful way. The “They,” or the faceless 
masses or others, make human life possible. Without “Them,” you’re nothing.
Of course, it’s easy to lose this point because Heidegger also thinks that we 
get lost and entangled in our worldly immersion, and he thinks we also have 
to be capable of understanding our existence in a way not defined by “Them.” 
Even though the world — as it’s created by “Them” — is necessary for you 
to meaningfully exist, you don’t need to get lost in the world of “Them.” Of 
course, it’s natural to do this; we tend to express the identity of the faceless, 
I do, therefore I am?
Heidegger seems to think that our very basic 
way of existing is a kind of activity that’s deeply 
immersed in the world. This view of the relation-
ship between self and world, however, hasn’t 
always been popular. In fact, it’s a fairly radical 
way of understanding the self, although it’s more 
typical in the East than in the West. Historically, 
Heidegger is opposing a very ingrained tradition 
that says thinking is primary — a view that sees 
the self or existence as private and subjective, 
and fully contained within one’s own mind as a 
thinking and conscious being. This view comes 
from René Descartes (1596–1650). Descartes 
argues that the fact that you exist is shown 
conclusively by the fact that you think. As he 
famously points out in his book Meditations, “I 
think, therefore I am.” For Descartes, you think 
first and then you engage in practical, worldly 
activity.
Heidegger reverses this, suggesting in a sense, 
“I do, therefore I am.” Conscious thought comes 
after practical activity, specifically (for him) 
when practical activity breaks down! You start 
to consciously notice objects or even yourself 
as a thing when some practical activity that 
you’re engaged in breaks down for some reason. 
So for Heidegger, although you have the capac-
ity to think, or be self-conscious, it’s not your 
essence at all, as Descartes thinks it is.

125
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
anonymous mass. In the everyday, we tend to fall away from what we are, 
existing not as individual “I-Selves” but as “They-Selves.” Although “They” are 
necessary to your existence, don’t forget that part of what being-in-the-world 
means is to maintain a sense of self apart from “Them” (we discuss this con-
cept in more detail in Chapter 9).
This, of course, raises the question of authenticity. Can you be authentic? Is 
conformity your fate? Heidegger seems to stress that without a background 
of conformity, you as an individual couldn’t really exist. Still, authenticity is 
possible if you can succeed in living in-the-world in a way that discloses what 
you are fully, and part of what you are is an individual. On the other hand, 
inauthentic people hide what they’re capable of by happily living in a con-
tented way as part of the “They.”
Sensing others all around you
Heidegger thinks that one of the essential components of your existence lies 
in the fact that you’re what he calls being-with. What Heidegger means by this 
is that existing in-the-world means also existing alongside other entities just 
like you. You’re with them in the very way that you go about living your life, 
engaging with your daily existence, taking on roles, and working with tools.
Heidegger argues that the meaning of a tool is also connected to other tools. 
Understanding the meaning of a hammer means unthinkingly using it in a way 
that simply acknowledges that it’s used in-order-to-pound-nails. But that means 
that you must understand what nails are too! And nails also point to other 
tools, and so on, until finally a world of significance forms around you, one 
that encapsulates you within a meaningful environment.
 
But tools point to more than just other tools, don’t they? Sure, the hammer 
points to the nail, and the nail to the wood, and the wood to the house, but 
then . . . ? At some point, you reach a stage with no more in-order-to left! 
Instead, it then points to the for-the-sake-of-which. For example, at the level of a 
house, you understand that the house is built for other beings just like you.
Heidegger points out that this means your practical engagement with the 
world, your essential way of existing as the kind of entity you are, makes you 
aware, even if on a nonconscious level, of the existence of others. Simply by 
being-in-the-world, you’re always sensing the existence of others in what you 
do. You make houses for them with the hammers they build. The electricity in 
your own house tells you that they are still at the job. At the end of your 
property lies the boundary with the others.
In short, engaging with your experience in a meaningful way demands that 
you sense them. In fact, even when you’re physically alone, you’re never by 
yourself. For human beings, existing at all always points to their presence. 
You’re never really alone, even when there’s no one actually around.

126
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
You’re everyone and no one
In your most basic, everyday kind of living, you’re deeply immersed in your 
tasks, in your routine, and in the roles you play in life. When you engage 
with life in this way, however, you’re not really you. Instead, you’re a living 
embodiment of what Heidegger calls the “They” or the “one.” You become 
trapped within norms and roles and rules that you didn’t create. You tend to 
passively embody the societal programming that structures and makes mean-
ingful the things that you’re doing.
Your social background is required for meaning
Heidegger thinks that a social environment or world must be in place for you 
to exist in a meaningful way or for you to live a human life as you know it. 
Before you ever come on the scene, deeply engrained rituals, norms, and 
rules are already in place to govern how, within the human community, 
people see things as meaningful or significant. As a result, the very existence 
of a meaningful life — the kind of thing people are interested in when they 
ask big questions like “What’s the meaning of life?” — rely on the existence of 
this sort of social background. Without that background, you have no lan-
guage in which to ask, or to propose answers to, those questions.
 
When you ask, “What’s the meaning of life?” you typically want to know “How 
do I live?” When you think about these things, you ponder whether it’s right 
for you to be a parent, or to be a musician, or to be a carpenter and build 
homes. You want to know how to dispose yourself toward the world.
But that world is a social one. Being a parent is a meaningful option because 
it has a social and cultural history. Carpentry is meaningful because of the 
hammers and nails — made by others — and because they’re supposed to be 
used in certain ways for certain things. You typically don’t pick up a hammer 
and use it to open your car door. That’s not what (intelligent!) people do. 
Parenting is understood as having children and in acting and being disposed 
to them in certain ways. That’s what people do when they’re parents. So 
when you ask those big questions about the meaning of life, you ask them 
while immersed within that context.
You’re a robot in everyday life
So who are you when you’re plugged into that everyday way of living in the 
social world that makes things meaningful for you? When you reach for that 
hammer to drive in that nail, who is that hammer for? Is it for you, or is it for 
anyone? It’s not for you as an individual. Clearly, hammers and nails (and par-
enthood and artistry) are roles and tools that are lying around for anyone to 
use. They make meaningful life possible, but they don’t speak to you.

127
 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
 
When you use those tools or take on those roles, in the everyday sense, you 
do so as anyone. As a result, Heidegger’s answer to the question “Who are 
you, in the everyday of your life?” is interesting. He says, “Everyone is the 
other, and no one is himself.”
You use the hammer as anyone would. You parent as “They” do. You decide 
to be an artist because it’s a path authorized and structured by “Them.” 
Heidegger puts it this way: “The they, which supplies the answer to the who 
of everyday Dasein, is the nobody to whom every Dasein has always already 
surrendered itself, in its being-among-one-another.”
Yeah, that sounds as weird (and as chilling!) as it should. In your everyday 
existence, you’re a bit of a robot. That’s right. In your everyday mode of life, 
you’re plugged in to the world of the general public in a way that you become 
that faceless mass. That means that the “They” isn’t something foreign to you. 
It is you. When you’re within the “They,” doing what “They” do, as “They” do 
it, an odd kind of concern overtakes you, one that guides your way of inter-
acting. It’s called distantiality. Within the “They,” you’re concerned not to 
stand out in any way. You seek to mirror the norms and behaviors of others, 
and you don’t focus on cultivating differences of any kind.
That’s right. You’re not a victim here of the “They” — you’re the perpetrator 
in your everyday way of living. In your everyday life, you’re a representative 
of the one (or the “They”) for others. If someone tries to do things differently, 
you react in a way that tries to reinforce the right norms without deviation 
(what one does to accomplish that, of course!). You may say something or 
just make a facial gesture.
 
It’s important to grasp Heidegger’s main point. He isn’t saying that what’s 
most basic to your existence is a you that then gets overrun by the “They.” 
Instead, the most basic aspect of your existence is the “They.” In the everyday, 
you’re not an “I-Self” — you’re a “They-Self.” Your most basic mode of being is 
a kind of robotic conformity. Still, if you want to be an individual (which we 
discuss in Chapter 9), this is where you must start; your individual self must 
emerge from your life in the everyday. Without an everyday self to function as 
the backdrop, your own individuality isn’t really possible.
Falling away . . . from yourself
Heidegger says that an essential part of what you are is a being-in-the-world. 
This means that your concern with your own existence and life always has a 
worldly character. Your concern always manifests itself in your concern with 
your projects, roles, plans, and undertakings. However, you can easily get 
lost in that world, tranquilized by the chatter of the crowd or the spectacle of 

128
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
worldly entanglements. You get absorbed, forgetting that part of what being-
in-the-world means is choosing how to define yourself instead of relying on 
the crowd to choose for you. It’s your existence; you can’t farm it out!
 
In an interesting passage, Heidegger notes “Being-in-the-world is in itself 
tempting.” Tempting? Why’s that? Being tempted implies that there’s a place 
you’re being tempted from and then a place you’re being tempted toward. If 
you’re on a diet, you’re tempted away from moderation in eating toward hit-
ting the buffet and living it up. So what does Heidegger mean by temptation?
In this chapter, we talk a lot about the immersion aspects that Heidegger 
stresses in his concept of being-in-the-world, but it’s essential to remember 
that, for Heidegger, an essential aspect of being you is being the type of entity 
that asks questions about your existence and life. Don’t forget that. We stress 
it all along, but in the following sections, we flesh out some of the implica-
tions of that claim.
Searching for mine-ness
Heidegger thinks that being concerned with how to live life, or asking what to 
be, is something you’re always doing. Even when you’re immersed entirely 
within the everyday, you’re doing that. In the everyday, however, your con-
cern about life is manifested in involving yourself in projects that “They” 
do, in ways that “They” want them done. But that’s not the only possibility 
for you.
 
An essential part of your existence lies in its mine-ness. What does that mean? 
Simply that your life is yours and no one else’s. It means that when you ask the 
question “What does life mean?” or “How should I live?” you’re asking a ques-
tion that can be finally answered only by you as the particular being that you 
are. It’s your life, and you have to live it. Of course, you can choose to live 
your life not as you but as “Them.”
Avoiding the fall
When you “fall,” as Heidegger puts it, you tend to find yourself in a way of 
engaging with the world that asks questions about life (you’re still engaged 
with the world, after all), but you’re asking them in a way that obscures your 
nature as mine-ness. You’re asking, “How does one live?” or “What do They 
think life means?” When you do that, you’re forgetting the essential question 
that’s fundamental to what you are, which is “Who and what am I?”
Heidegger calls this difference — between asking questions about life (through 
living) in the mode of the “They” and in the mode of “you yourself” — the dif-
ference between
 
 Being-in-the-world
 
 Being-in-the-midst-of-the-world

 Chapter 6: Understanding Our Unique Way of Existing in the World
When you’re a being-in-the-midst-of-the-world (Wow! That’s one monster 
hyphenated term!), you obscure your mine-ness. You start to think of what 
you are as being simply defined by the projects that you undertake and how 
they’re structured by the public, by others, or by society at large. You think 
of yourself entirely in terms of how “They” dictate that things are. As a result, 
you don’t take responsibility for deciding the direction of your own life. 
Heidegger says you get entangled in your concern with the world.
 
When you’re being in-the-midst-of-the-world, you’ve lost the being part of your 
existence. An essential aspect of you, your individual directedness or concern, 
has been lost. All that’s left, in a way, is the in-the-world part. Your being has 
fallen into the world and lost its own distinctive character. Heidegger thinks 
that you’re intimately tied to the world, even to the everyday, but you’re not 
identical to those things; don’t forget that a specific being is in-the-world. When 
you fall, that’s what you forget; you cease to ask questions about that being’s 
existence.
Being authentic: Determining 
the shape of your life
Heidegger’s way of talking about the ways of living makes it easy to talk about 
the possibilities you have for being inauthentic and for being authentic (see 
Chit-chatting your way through life
Heidegger thinks that it’s normal to forget that 
you’re an individual who should take a personal 
stance on how to live in the particular world you 
find yourself in. He thinks that when you fall (as 
he calls it), you tend to disengage with and step 
away from your own existence. He says that 
this can happen in two ways:
  Idle talk: When you engage in idle talk, you 
do what one does. In a way, it’s like deciding 
to live as an embodied gossiper. You’re not 
concerned with how well (or if at all) what 
one does connects to your world (or the 
world). Instead, you live in a way that just 
passes along the gossip of what one says to 
do by doing it and preaching it yourself.
  Curiosity: Curiosity is similar to what 
Kierkegaard (in Chapter 10) calls rotation 
method. It means being overly attracted to 
novelty and to superficial engagements with 
different things in the world. Instead of 
finding a task that’s right for you and 
committing to it, you satisfy your curiosity by 
dabbling through shallow, nonrisky, and 
nonengaged living.
If you sit back and are really honest with your-
self, how often do you engage in these different 
forms of living? Is your life engagement superfi-
cial? How immersed within what one does are 
you, anyway?

130
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Chapter 5 for more on authenticity in general, and see Chapter 9 for Heidegger’s 
own take on authentic living). Though the terms sound judgmental, Heidegger 
insists that neither is “better” than the other. If anything, one term (authentic-
ity) simply better discloses what you are as a whole being. Still, it’s important 
(don’t forget it) to realize that being inauthentic is needed if you want to be 
authentic. Heidegger can’t be telling you to leave inauthenticity behind for-
ever. That can’t be done. At the same time, inauthenticity is the ground that 
makes the emergence of authenticity possible.
 
Although the existentialists don’t all agree on this topic, Heidegger insists that 
these categories shouldn’t be understood as judgmental. You’re not bad or 
lowly (or sinful) if you’re inauthentic. And being authentic doesn’t mean 
reaching some kind of superior state of being. Being inauthentic and authentic 
are both possibilities for you, so both are equally real.
Instead, think of it this way: When you’re authentic, you’re fully disclosed in 
your way of living. Everything you are is laid out in full view. You embrace life 
in a way that takes full responsibility for what you are. You see that what one 
does is just one way of doing things, not the only way, so you take an active 
role in determining the shape of your life.
Inauthentic existence tends to do the opposite. It cedes responsibility for 
living to others, to the “They.” The inauthentic try to farm out or outsource 
what it means to exist to the crowd. This way of living does highlight the 
worldly part of life, but it obscures its individual aspect.
 
According to Heidegger, being inauthentic is perfectly natural. It’s where you 
start. Never forget the social character of what you are. Without a social envi-
ronment that makes the meaningful character of human life possible, you 
couldn’t exist in a significant fashion. Authenticity is a way of responding to 
becoming too immersed (or lost, or fallen) in that social environment. But with-
out inauthenticity, and the falling that’s natural to it, you couldn’t exist at all.

More Passion in Our Lives
In This Chapter
 Comprehending passion as engaged living
 Analyzing the key elements of engaged life
 Grasping the link between passion and truth
 Viewing Kierkegaard’s attacks on the modern age
A
ll existentialists believe that living with passion is important. Whereas 
most people take living with passion to mean living frantically and 
doing lots of impulsive things, that’s not what passion means from the exis-
tential point of view. Instead, passion means living life in an intense and delib-
erate way, one that flows from grappling seriously with the significance and 
meaning of your own individual life.
A core ingredient in living passionately is finding a cause or giving your life 
meaning. The meaning you find for your life should be one you’re willing to 
die for, one you’re willing to commit to organizing your whole life around. To 
be truly passionate, such a choice must also embrace a degree of mystery 
or uncertainty. By making these kinds of choices and commitments, you can 
make sure your life embodies the kind of risk that passion thrives on.
Kierkegaard thinks that living a life that’s passionate is directly connected 
with the notion of truth, suggesting that the passionate life is truth. In talking 
this way, Kierkegaard introduces a new notion of truth, one that differs from 
the typically accepted scientific version. To live truly and passionately, you 
have to embody your life’s purpose and let it transform who you are. In this 
way, truth turns out to mean more than a case of intellectually acknowledg-
ing that some reality external to you matches an idea that you have of that 
reality.

132
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Unfortunately, not everyone lives passionately. In fact, Kierkegaard thinks 
that passion is hard to find in the contemporary world. Most people just want 
life to be easy and safe. They avoid striving and want answers about life to be 
handed to them. They desperately seek to avoid the anxiety that comes with 
grappling with their own existence. The temptations of the media didn’t help 
matters, Kierkegaard thinks, given that they work effectively to undermine 
passion by distracting people from the business of real living. If Kierkegaard 
were alive today, no doubt he would be equally critical of the Internet age for 
the same reasons.
In this chapter, we examine all these points. We start by looking closely at 
what Kierkegaard means when he says that a life of passion is a life of engage-
ment. From there, we turn to how living a life of engagement requires find-
ing a cause to guide your life. This discussion puts us in a great position to 
then examine Kierkegaard’s notion of truth, one that suggests that truth is 
properly understood as a specific way of living. Only passionate life, he said, 
can be said to be “in the truth.” Last, we examine why Kierkegaard thinks 
that passionate, engaged, truthful living is so difficult for us today in modern 
times. The present age, he says, is without passion.
Seeing Passion as a Life of Engagement
Each of us is free. Unlike other, nonhuman things in the world, you have the 
unique ability to actually take on the question of your own existence. And 
you can let your engagement with that question help you carve a direction 
for yourself through life. Who are you? What’s the significance of life? Why 
are you alive? You’re free to ask and answer these important questions. 
Count yourself lucky; not everything can do that!
So it’s up to you. You can step up to the plate and start swinging, asking the 
big questions and deciding how to create the direction of your own life, or you 
can just stand around and watch the balls go by; it’s your decision. The exis-
tentialists say, “Swing away!” Living passionately means taking the questions, 
and your responsibility in answering them, seriously. You have to take your life 
seriously and engage with it. Wrestle with it! Look it squarely in the eye!
A life of engaged passion reveals at least two qualities.
 
 A passionate life emphasizes how you go about living and not what you 
end up actually doing.
 
 Living passionately means cultivating a bond with your own life that 
doesn’t approach it as a problem to be solved, but as a relationship that 
you need to involve yourself in and remain open to.

133
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
In this section, we discuss these issues in depth. We discuss the importance 
of cultivating your freedom, which means making use of your ability to not 
only ask about the meaning of your own life, but also use the answers you 
come up with to fashion the future course of your life. This way of living 
displays passion, a way of approaching life that’s truly committed to caring 
about the actual quality of your existence.
Freedom reveals the individual
It’s not surprising that Kierkegaard, as an existentialist, thinks freedom is 
an essential part of being a person. You’re different from the nonhuman 
creatures that surround you, so the way in which you approach your own 
life should be seen as different from the way animals approach theirs. You 
should strive to live not as an animal but as a human — as the free creature 
you are.
One aspect of freedom involves the capacity for autonomous self-movement 
and self-directed behavior. Cats and cows aren’t capable of that indepen-
dence because they’re purely natural beings; in other words, their behavior 
is always determined by worldly facts. What this distinction highlights is 
the fact that the physical composition of a cat, the environment the cat is 
in, and the natural laws that govern the world of the cat all work together to 
uniquely determine what the cat does at each moment of its life. The cat 
isn’t free!
 
Think of arranging a series of dominoes in a row. Knocking over the first 
causes a chain reaction so that the rest fall, one by one, until the last one 
does. That’s how the behavior of nonhuman objects works. The conditions 
in the natural world at one instant cause the conditions in the next instant, 
which cause the conditions in the next, and so on.
Seen in this way, nonhuman objects, being entirely natural in composition, 
don’t make choices; they’re not free. Even when an animal such as a cat 
appears to be making choices, like seeming to decide of its own free will 
to get up and walk over to its food bowl, its life is really just a complicated 
string of falling dominoes. At each moment the cat is doing what its biology 
and its environment dictate.
We admit it — you’re a natural being too. Sometimes your movements are 
dictated by factors in the physical natural world. If you fall in the ocean and 
can’t swim, you’ll drown. If you touch an electric fence, you’ll jump backward 
and shriek in pain. But you’re not like the cat or the cow, whose behaviors 
are always explainable in these worldly ways. Instead, the existentialists 
think that there are always instances in which you can be self-moving. When 

134
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
you lift your arm, it raises up because you decide to lift it. For the existential-
ists, this intentional action isn’t the result of some set of environmental con-
ditions in the world. When you do act intentionally, which includes deciding 
how you face up to your impending future, your actions are up to you alone 
and nothing else.
 
Of course, your freedom to choose how to act in the present and face the 
future has limitations placed on it by the world you live in. If you’re very fat, 
you won’t be able to run very fast. But you can always make the choice to lose 
weight so as to run faster, even if you’ll still encounter an upper limit on just 
how fast you’re able to run. (Sorry — you’ll never outrun that cheetah.)
The unique nature of your freedom shows that although you do live in the 
world and are subject to its influences, you also transcend the world because 
you’re not determined by it, as the cat is. Of course, when the existentialists 
say transcend, they don’t mean that you float above the world like a disem-
bodied spirit. They just mean that you can rise above the physical cause-
and-effect explanations that seem to govern nonhuman things. (We talk more 
about Kierkegaard’s view of this topic in Chapter 10.)
Because freedom is an essential part of what you are, it’s a facet of your 
existence that you must cultivate if you’re to live in an honest, truthful, or 
authentic way. You must be true to this special aspect of what you are. This 
cultivation requires that you take the question of how to face your future and 
your existence very seriously.
Cultivating a sense of passion
It’s centrally important that you embrace the kind of existence that’s proper 
and specific to you, one that has freedom at its core. Face it — unlike cats 
and cows and tables and chairs, you’re not a passive object. You’re an active 
subject. Living with passion means embracing your subjectivity. When you 
succeed in embracing your nature as a subject, you cultivate passion.
What does passionate life look like? Most people mistake passion with reck-
less impulsiveness. For them, living passionately means living life to the full-
est by going to lots of parties, skydiving, and bungee-jumping from bridges.
 
Now don’t get the wrong impression — the existentialists aren’t against fun. 
Bungee-jumping can take place in a passionate life. But activities of that sort 
don’t define passion. In fact, passion isn’t something you can necessarily say a 
person has by simply looking at him and watching what he does. Passion isn’t 
an externality; it centers on a kind of focus and intensity, a type of deliberate-
ness about how you go about things. Kierkegaard calls it inwardness.

135
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
To Kierkegaard, passionate people are inward because they strive to be and 
to exist as subjects and not as objects.
 
 An object is passive in its existence because it has no choice about how 
it exists. It does what its world dictates that it do. Objects like rocks or 
cats don’t take on the question of their own existence, or how to face 
their future, because they can’t; they don’t have the ability.
 
 A subject is active in its existence due to its capacity to choose how to 
exist or how to face its future. Subjects can direct themselves and can 
interact with the question of what it means to exist. Unlike objects, they 
can decide for themselves how to be in the world.
Passionate people take their very existence seriously. In cultivating their pas-
sion, they seek to develop their subjectivity, or existence as a subject. When 
you immerse yourself within subjectivity, you exhibit a deep sense of care 
about who you are, about the way in which you exist. You realize that you’ve 
been handed a gift — the power of self-determination — and you use it.
Passionate people are purposeful. Their sense of care about their own exis-
tence creates an intensity in them, a level of depth not seen in people who 
simply go with the flow.
 
You may think passionate people sound pretty grim because they’re so 
serious about life. Not so. What is true is that passionate people recognize 
that each decision they make plays a role in determining who they become. 
Because they care about themselves, they refuse to treat their lives in trivial 
ways. For them, not being passionate about life is what sounds grim!
It’s not what you do but how you do it
One way to understand passionate life is to draw the distinction between living 
as a participator and living as a detached observer. For a participator, living a 
full life is more about how actions occur. For the observer, living a full life is 
about what gets done. Passion participates rather than observes.
Imagine that a person saves a child from being hit by a car. A question arises: 
What’s important here, ethically? Is it that the person saved the child or how 
he came about doing it? For some people, all that matters is that the child 
was saved. They focus on what occurs as ethically meaningful.
Similarly, for some people, living to the fullest or living meaningfully always 
means doing things. Did you do this? Did you do that? Did you go to the 
party? Did you ride on the roller coaster at the park? The answer to whether 
a person really lived a full life always comes down to something that anyone 

136
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
can see from the outside. If you want to know whether you yourself are living 
passionately, you can do so by floating above your body and just watching 
yourself to see whether you’re doing the right things. For the nonpassionate 
observer, whether Bob lives a full life, or a meaningful or significant life, can 
be determined by following Bob around all his life and just observing what 
he does.
 
Existentialists like Kierkegaard disagree with this nonpassionate observer. 
Passionate life isn’t just about doing certain things. What’s missing is engage-
ment. People centrally concerned simply with what a person does, Kierkegaard 
says, have “forgotten what it means to exist, and what inwardness signifies.”
To really exist requires engagement. Think about the child-rescue example 
again. Some people focus on what action is performed, but others focus on 
how that action took place. Maybe the person saved the child but did it for a 
reward only. For some, this way of coming at the action rules it out as ethical, 
regardless of what the action does, as seen from the outside. According to 
these people, ethical importance is centrally determined by how the action is 
carried out.
Kierkegaard’s point about living a full life is similar. How you come at life is 
important. Are you resolute in your living? Does your action flow from a deep 
commitment to being a certain kind of individual? Does it fill you with a sheer 
excitement about life? These questions are integral for existentialists. In 
other words, how something is done matters! In fact, for Kierkegaard, the how 
is always more important than the what.
 
Note that this principle opens a tremendous number of possibilities for you. 
Because living a full life isn’t restricted to doing a certain set of actions, figur-
ing out what path to follow is up to you. At that point, existentialists are con-
cerned with how you pursue it! So it’s important to remember that:
 
 It’s up to you to figure out what path, out of all the ones possible for 
you, to take.
 
 After you choose that path, the existentialists urge you to pursue it with 
passion and engagement, with a fire of lived intensity.
Truly Passionate Life Finds a Cause
Your coauthors like to think that existentialists believe in the importance of 
cultivating a beautiful relationship with your own life. Like all meaningful rela-
tionships, that’s not easy to do. Beautiful relationships take work.

137
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
First things first. You must find a cause to be engaged in through living. This 
means that you must grapple with existence and figure out how to approach 
it. In a way, you must find your existential calling; you must continually try 
to determine how to live in a way best suited to your individual self and the 
very concrete world you find yourself in. Because the integrity of your very 
existence is at stake, this cause must be something that you’re willing to 
die — and live — for. Anything less disrespects your own relationship with 
life and cheapens it by refusing to treat it with the seriousness that comes 
with real passion.
Finding an ideal or cause that’s worth living (or dying) for also requires 
taking a position on your own existence that embraces mystery and risk. The 
more your position on life or your commitment is understandable, the less 
mysterious it is and, as a result, the safer it is. Instead, you have to take big 
chances in staking out your existence, because that’s what life expects from 
you. Playing it safe with your life is really just waiting around to die. To the 
existentialists, that is depressing and grim!
For the existentialists, a passionate life includes not only committing reso-
lutely to a path you’re willing to die for, but also doing so in a way that 
embraces the fact that you can never be sure that you picked the right 
road to tread. As a result, passionate living means opening yourself to the 
vulnerabilities of life. You realize that life is, in a way, bigger than you are. 
You’ll never be able to truly figure it all out or have it under your control. 
Passionate life is intense, it’s committed, it’s risky, and it’s vulnerable — 
open to the mysteries of existence and of life.
Your cause should express your life
Cultivating a beautiful relationship with your own existence requires you to 
choose a direction in life that expresses your individuality. No two people 
can share such a direction. Because passion requires that you express your 
own freedom and subjectivity, you must revolt against allowing your choices 
and projects to flow from any influences outside your individual nature.
At the most basic level, being passionate means being very aware of the very 
particular, concrete world that you live in. Living passionately means putting 
your foot down and saying, “This is the way I will respond to my world.”
Each of us is faced with this demand at each moment of our lives. Most of 
us try to avoid facing up to it; instead, we let those in different situations, 
or even the crowd, choose how we live. When you do that, your life is no 
longer an individual expression; instead, your cause (if it deserves that name) 
reflects them (the others). You know the drill. You go to work for a certain 
company and marry such and such a person. You do your best to avoid this 

138
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
or that belief or behavior because doing otherwise would upset the larger 
group you have similarities with.
Why does this happen? Well, maybe it’s your parents you want to mirror. 
Maybe it’s your town. It doesn’t matter why you conform or to whom; what’s 
important to remember is that the fastest way to destroy passion and begin 
merely observing life is to treat yourself in this way. When this happens, you 
become existentially undignified. You’re a subject, but you refuse to treat 
yourself as one. Instead, you treat yourself as a passionless object. When you 
allow what’s external to you to determine your existence, you step out of the 
driver’s seat and become a passenger; maybe you’re even in the proverbial 
backseat of your own life!
 
When coauthor Chris was a kid, he was forced to play softball in gym class. 
He didn’t feel comfortable playing because he was afraid he’d be bad at it. So 
when it was his turn to be up at bat, he would just stand there, never swing, 
and strike out. The coach would yell at him, “Chris, are you gonna swing the 
bat or just be a looker?”
Coach’s existential message was clear: If you don’t swing, you strike out 
anyway. Being on the field and just watching isn’t playing the game. You may 
as well swing and throw yourself totally into it while you’re at it. Give it your 
best shot. You may miss, but you’ll always be engaged with the game. In 
sports, this mindset is called heart; in existentialism, it’s called passion.
It’s up to you to step up to the plate. You don’t have any choice; you’re on the 
field of life, and you can’t get off (well, unless you commit suicide, and that 
seems like the wrong alternative to us; see Chapter 5 for Camus’s view on sui-
cide). If you start swinging by striving to express your own individual nature, 
you’ll be plugged into the world in an exhilarating (though scary!) way.
Of course, the alternative is to stand at the plate and watch the balls go by, 
allowing others to make your decisions for you (perhaps because you’re 
afraid of striking out). Yeah, it’s easy. It’s safe. But it displays no passion. No 
heart. No excellence.
You should commit to a 
cause worth dying for
 
Kierkegaard puts it succinctly: “The thing is to a find a truth which is true for 
me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.” Although living with zest or 
living life to the fullest is often an excuse for living fast or partying a lot, it’s 
really about the need to find a reason to live that you’re ready to stake your 
life on. If you pick any lesser goal, you’re just playing at being serious about 
your life. Your relationship to existence, or to your life, isn’t beautiful; it’s 
undignified.

139
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
People often ask, “Is that worth dying for?” when they want to know whether 
something is really worth the kind of time and commitment the goal requires. 
The question is fundamentally serious and important, perhaps the most 
important one you can ask about proposed paths in life.
Face it — you will die. Assume that just before you die, you have the chance 
to look back on what you did in your life and reflect so as to take stock of 
what you’ve become. You want to be able to say that your life, or the way in 
which you engaged with the world, was worth living so that you can embrace 
your quickly approaching death.
Many times, people fritter away their choices and time (as the old Pink Floyd 
song “Time” suggests), ignoring the fact that they’ll die. When they behave 
this way, their lives start to lack cohesion and unity; they become superficial 
and lack intensity. (We talk more about the importance of embracing death — 
and even the aforementioned Pink Floyd song — in Chapter 9.)
But you will die, whether you ignore death or not. You have to face up to 
that. Your life is made up of a finite number of moments, which means you 
can’t do everything. When you choose one option, the other options are gone 
forever. There are no mulligans in life; at the end, you simply die, and your 
time to pick paths and roads ends abruptly.
If life, as we mention earlier, is about swinging the bat and trying to con-
nect with the ball, passion requires keeping death in view and realizing the 
Try this yourself: An honesty quiz
Don’t put off the question of intense living. Right 
now, put this book down and ask, “What’s the 
overarching goal that gives meaning to my life?” 
Ask yourself a few questions.
What’s your aim in life? In other words, what’s 
the most important thing in life to you? What’s 
the one thing that seems to give meaning and 
purpose to all the things in your life? Now ask 
yourself whether you’re willing to die for this 
cause or ideal.
  If your answer is no, ask yourself, “Am I 
really living? Or am I merely persisting and 
going through the motions? Am I just sitting 
around waiting to die?”
  If your answer is yes, ask yourself, “Is my 
life organized intentionally around that goal 
and cause? Or is it disorganized, sometimes 
in accordance with that goal and some-
times not? If it’s disorganized, doesn’t living 
life to the fullest mean doing something 
about that?”
Dealing with such questions doesn’t make you 
morbid; it makes you intentional and purposive. 
A person who succeeds at living in the face of 
death this way truly deserves to have on his 
tombstone the words I lived.

140
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
importance of your present choices. That means realizing this may be your 
last time at the plate, so swing for the fences. Perhaps the character Andy 
in the movie The Shawshank Redemption puts it best: “Get busy living or get 
busy dying.” Of course, this same saying is in the Bob Dylan song “It’s Alright 
Ma (I’m Only Bleeding),” in which the lyrics read, “He not busy being born 
is busy dying.” Dylan and Andy have the same message: Playing it safe with 
little goals you aren’t willing to die for isn’t the way to go about living. It’s the 
way to be dead while you’re alive.
Choices must include mystery and risk
Cultivating a passionate relationship with your own existence requires 
making commitments you’re willing to die for. It also requires you to make 
choices whose significance and worth can’t be definitely established. This 
means embracing mystery and uncertainty into the core of your life. Because 
nothing less important than the meaning you place in existence hangs in the 
balance, because you never know whether the path you choose is the right 
one, it means taking the greatest risks and not playing it safe.
 
Think of a relationship with a loved one. Romantic relationships contain lots 
of mysterious elements. After all, you’re dealing with a person, not a thing. 
And when you’re dealing with people, you can never say you know them 
completely. Who knows? You can never know whether things will work out 
as you planned. After all, relationships are composed of free subjects, so you 
can’t determine what will happen. Maybe this person will change tomorrow 
unexpectedly, and all the years you spent in the relationship will seem wasted. 
That’s why relationships are risky. To enter into a relationship in a meaningful 
way, you have to take a chance. After all, you can’t fully control a meaningful 
relationship. You have to give yourself over to the uncertainty that passionate 
relationships harbor so as to truly experience that relationship. You should 
approach your existence in the same way.
Much as you try to accumulate evidence in favor of your choices about how 
to live your life, you can never know for sure that you made the right deci-
sion. The existentialists believe that there’s nothing external to you that you 
can use to see whether your choices are actually meaningful or significant. 
That task is yours alone. As a result, an element of mystery always comes 
with trying to figure out how you should engage with your own life. The kinds 
of big questions about life just don’t have clear-cut answers. Doing math may 
be black and white, but asking about the meaning of life, or how you should 
live, seems to have a lot of gray in it. In fact, the farther you seem to dig into 
the significance of life, the more perplexing it seems to become!

 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t ask questions — quite the opposite. After 
all, you’re grappling with your existence here! But you shouldn’t ask or 
pursue those questions with the intention of controlling existence and shak-
ing the right answers out of it so that you can feel more confident in the way 
you live.
 
David Hume, a famous 18th-century philosopher, once said about life that 
“The whole is a riddle, an enigma, an inexplicable mystery.” Camus (whom we 
talk about in Chapter 5) feels strongly that “doctrines that explain everything 
to me also debilitate me at the same time.” Camus’s great point captures what 
we’re saying: He feels offended by the desire to explain everything about life, 
because such explanations would “relieve” him, as he put it, of the “weight of 
my own life.” Mystery and risk are what give life that weight; they’re the fuel 
from which the fire of passion burns.
As 20th-century existentialist Gabriel Marcel once put it, don’t think of life as 
a problem that needs to be solved. That’s not what it means to be in a rela-
tionship with life. Instead, it’s what it means to be in a confrontation with life. 
It’s hostility! How to live life isn’t a puzzle that you try to conquer. Instead, 
life is something you need to strive to be — to get involved with. Face it — 
your relationship with life is the most intense bond you’ll ever have. Figure 
out how to cultivate that relationship in just the right way. Treat life with the 
respect that it deserves.
The more you do this, the more you’ll become open to your own existence. 
Of course, this openness means being shaken by the fundamentally insecure 
position you find yourself in as a chooser. Basically, living passionately means 
choosing to be vulnerable in the face of your own life. It means recognizing 
Try this yourself: How do you love truth?
The German writer Gotthold Lessing (1721–1781) 
once introduced an interesting dilemma: What 
if God offered you a choice? In his right hand, 
he would have all truth, and in his left hand, he 
would have only the capacity to strive for truth, 
coupled with the possibility for error. You simply 
need to choose one hand.
If God were to present you with this question, 
which hand would you choose? Lessing sug-
gested that he would choose the left hand. From 
an existentialist’s perspective, choosing the 
right hand means choosing an existential death. 
In possessing all truth, you would destroy the 
very possibility of existing as a human being, an 
existence that requires the kind of passionate 
striving that includes mystery and the kind of 
risk that comes along with it. To know all truth 
would be to control existence, but at the cost 
of losing all passion for life. You would become 
forever detached from the business of actual 
living.

142
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
the insecurity that surrounds your life choices, but also recognizing that 
those choices still need to be made with solid resolution and committed 
force. If you think about it, isn’t that what all truly passionate relationships 
turn out to be?
Truth Is Passionate Living
For existentialists, embracing a passionate existence is important. It means 
finding an individual direction for yourself that reflects your own particular-
ity. This direction must retain a maximum appreciation for the mystery of 
life; as a result, choosing it means taking a significant risk with your life.
Kierkegaard, however, goes further; he also makes the more radical claim 
that if a person succeeds in engaging with life in a passionate way, that 
person exists in the truth. This statement takes the discussion of passion 
to a new level. Is Kierkegaard being metaphorical? Can a way of living — 
separate from what is done — be related to truth? Seeing what he means 
requires analyzing the notion of truth in general. From there, you can see that 
just as a notion of truth exists for objects, Kierkegaard thinks that a notion of 
truth applicable to subjects is appropriate as well.
Kierkegaard’s claim that passion and truth are connected leads him to 
rethink truth as a matter of appropriation. This means that for something to 
be true, you must make it your own, an active way of approaching truth very 
different from the common notion that sees truth as something discovered. 
Due to his specific way of understanding truth, Kierkegaard also argues that 
immersion in the crowd, which lacks passion and appropriation, is really 
what he called untruth.
What is truth?
Most people would agree that striving doggedly for truth is important. But 
what’s truth? At the most basic, common sense suggests that truth looks like 
a special kind of representing. Specifically, you say that if X is “true,” what X 
represents truly exists.
Representation is easy to understand. For one item (X) to represent another 
item (Y) is to say that X stands in for Y. For example, a map of New York rep-
resents what the map is supposed to be about (New York) when it accurately 
depicts the actual distances between fixtures in the actual landscape, when 
the roads on the map accurately represent the real highways, and so on. In 
such circumstances, most people are willing to say that the map stands in for 
the actual landscape of New York and so is true.

143
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
Most of the time, people use truth to talk about sentences, which are like 
maps in a way. When someone says, “The moon circles the earth,” he makes 
a claim about objective reality or about what things are. What makes the sen-
tence true is objective reality itself. Is the situation in the objective world just 
like the sentence says it is? In other words, does the moon really circle the 
earth? If it does, the sentence is true; if it doesn’t, it’s false.
 
Note, however, that this way of talking about truth seems to deal exclusively 
with objects, or with what things are. For most inquiries, this kind of truth, 
dealing with what things are — or what Kierkegaard calls objective truth — is 
perfectly appropriate. Most of the time, you want to know whether “the tor-
nado heading this way is big” or whether “the water is boiling.” In these cases, 
all you want to know is whether the sentences you’re using map onto the 
world around you.
Whether an objective truth exists doesn’t require any personal involvement 
on your part. Being detached from the situation doesn’t create a problem. 
For example, claiming that “water is boiling” is true can be verified by observ-
ing (in this case, visually) whether the object (the water) referred to in the 
sentence really has those properties (boiling). If so, the statement is true. 
What would your involvement add? After all, if the water is boiling, that’s true 
independently of you. So the issues of you and your life and the existence of 
objective truths about things are entirely separate from one another.
Most of the time, people want this separation to be the case. Think of sci-
ence. Science is supposed to give you knowledge about the truths of the 
world that you live in. You don’t want those truths to depend on the exis-
tence of the scientists or on anyone in particular. If chemical XYZ is bad for 
your health, you want that to be a fact that’s independent of the personal 
existence of everyone. You want it to be a brute, impersonal truth you can 
count on.
 
But think this belief through for a moment. If one kind of truth pertains to 
the existence of objects, does another kind of truth pertain to the existence 
of subjects (subjective truth)? If so, truth can actually exist in a way that’s 
completely independent of science. Because subjects are defined by how they 
exist, a notion of subjective truth would have to take the engagement of the 
person into question. As such, these truths wouldn’t be independent of you 
because their very existence would require your own deep involvement in the 
world.
Truth is subjective
Most people are positivists, which means that they accept one kind of 
truth — the kind that science prizes. If science can’t authenticate something, 

144
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
positivists say, it’s not worth talking about because it’s just nonsense. The 
existentialists, however, reject positivism. Instead, they claim that the way 
that we talk actually reveals that we believe in another type of truth, which 
Kierkegaard calls subjective truth. These truths relate to the kind of how 
(subjective) existence that human beings possess as living, engaging sub-
jects. The existentialists think that when we say that we must dedicate our 
lives to truth, subjective truth is what we really mean.
To highlight the two different kinds of truth, it’s helpful to think about the 
different ways that you use the verb know. The connection between knowing 
and truth is a tight one; if you say that you know something, you mean that 
you’re in some way connected to the truth about that item. Different ways of 
knowing imply different types of truth. With this in mind, think about these 
two ways the verb is used:
 
 You claim that you know that God is X, Y, or Z.
 
 You claim that you know God.
What’s the difference? In the first example, you know that God is this or 
that. Perhaps you know that God is good, or that God is all-powerful, or 
something of that sort. You’re claiming that some sentence like “God is X” is 
true because what it claims exists externally to you. If God is omniscient, for 
example, that’s truth independent of you and independent of whether you 
know it to be true.
How do you come to know these kinds of truths? The method is pretty 
straightforward. You look at the sentence and then you look at the object. 
You notice through distanced observation that they match (the form of dis-
tanced observation can differ; perhaps you use logic or reason, or perhaps 
you simply use your eyesight). In the end, you as a subject have nothing to do 
with whether the sentence is in fact true.
Now think about the second use of the verb know, which is very different 
from the first. When you say you know God, you’re not implying that you’re 
comparing sentences with objects and seeing whether they match. Instead, 
you’re claiming that you’re in a relationship with God, that you’re involved 
with God in some way. “Knowing God” in this sense has a meaning like “living 
life intimately with God as your co-pilot” or something very much like it. 
“Knowing God” means letting God inform the way that you live. Clearly, this 
kind of truth isn’t independent of you!
 
So what does truth mean in this second sense? Instead of comparing sentences 
to objects, subjective truth compares ways of coming at life with existence 
itself. As Kierkegaard puts it, “What is truth, but to live for an idea?” As such, 
for a subject to exist in the truth means to have a cause or ideal worth dying 
for and to passionately engage with life through it. When your ideal is worth 
dying for, and when you’re related to it in the right way, truth is embodied in 
the way that you live your life.

145
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
The paradox of living in truth
Kierkegaard claims that truth is a paradox (dilemma or puzzle). Although 
Kierkegaard’s notion of paradox varies, one version of it is this: Although a 
person who lives in truth cares deeply about the actual objective reality of 
what he believes in, he isn’t motivated to engage with it for the purpose of 
gaining external assurances that it really exists. A tough way to live!
 
Kierkegaard is clear that subjective truth deals only with what he calls essen-
tial truths about your own personal existence, such as morality and religion. 
Subjective truths concern the questions and issues surrounding walking the 
right path in life.
Kierkegaard’s passionate pagan 
versus the hypocritical Christian
The existential notion of truth really relates to 
the relationship you have with life. The more 
your way of living accurately represents what 
it means to be a subject, the more truth you find 
in it.
Kierkegaard uses a great example to explain 
how this principle works. He says that the 
pagan who prays passionately to a false God 
shows more truth than the Christian who prays 
falsely to his real God. As a Christian himself, 
Kierkegaard is making a powerful point. To live 
for an idea is to dedicate your life to it in a pas-
sionate sense.
The pagan is living for his idea, even if the 
idea itself doesn’t match anything in reality. 
In the case of the false Christian, his idea is 
of something that really exists (according to 
Kierkegaard), but the way he’s living isn’t true 
to what it means to have that idea. The false 
Christian has no true relationship to God or to 
his own existence, because he has the wrong 
relationship to the idea in question. The pagan 
has the right relationship to his existence, living 
in a way that’s true to the ideal, whereas the 
Christian doesn’t. As a result, one lives in truth 
and the other in untruth.
Recall Kierkegaard’s distinction about truth. 
Praying to a God whom you believe exists but 
who doesn’t transform your identity isn’t to live 
in truth; truthful existence is the kind of living 
that’s literally transformed by what it engages 
with. Praying to a false God who does transform 
you is living in truth. The false Christian has no 
transforming relationship to his God as an ideal, 
so it never touches him.
Do you agree with Kierkegaard? If you had a 
choice between believing in the wrong ideas 
faithfully and truly, and believing in the right 
ideas falsely, which would you choose? Most 
people would likely choose the second option, 
thinking that objective truth is more important 
than subjective truth. What about you?

146
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Living in the truth, however, requires an interesting mix of states internal to 
the person in question. For one, to be passionate about an ideal means want-
ing that ideal to correspond to something in reality. If you believe in God, you 
want God to actually exist. Passionate people don’t dismiss such concerns; 
they take them very seriously. This intense gravity and seriousness that 
attach to life choices cause them to spark anxiety in you. After all, you want 
there to be a real aspect to what you devote your life to, don’t you? No one 
wants to pursue a nonexistent fiction!
At the same time, living in the truth means not being motivated to pursue 
that idea on the basis of objective evidence or proofs. In fact, Kierkegaard is 
adamant about one thing: The more you can prove the objective reality of 
your ideal, the less passion you attach to it, and the less it seems worth pur-
suing. As a result, the more assured you are about the objective truth of the 
ideal, the less subjective truth will be embodied by pursuing it. Similarly, the 
more you pursue evidence for your ideal, the more it will appear that you lack 
passion about it.
Thus lies the heart of one sense of paradox at the core of subjective truth. 
Living in the truth or with passion requires firmly embracing and committing 
to ideals that you keep in a state of uncertainty. Passion requires not knowing 
whether that ideal is objectively true. As Kierkegaard puts it, “Passion and 
the paradox fit each other perfectly.” Here, you see Kierkegaard’s attempt 
to link a dimension of truth to his requirement that a truly passionate life 
requires uncertainty and risk. Truth and passion require mystery.
Making truth yours alone
When you find ways to address the question of how to live and commit to 
those ways passionately, you live in truth. But what specifically makes such 
a life a true one? It can’t be that what makes your path true is the presence 
of evidence for it; Kierkegaard thinks passion requires embracing the uncer-
tainty of what you pursue. Instead, he thinks you must make the truth yours 
alone by appropriating it and allowing it to transform your identity and your 
life.
 
In a famous quotation, Kierkegaard says, “Here is such a definition of truth: an 
objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation process of the most pas-
sionate inwardness is the truth, the highest truth attainable by the individual.”
Truth is the holding fast of an objective uncertainty. That part is easy 
enough; it just means that you embrace the lack of certainty that what your 
ideal or idea corresponds to objectively exists. But how do you hold that 
uncertainty fast in an appropriation process? To see what he means, we need to 

147
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
distinguish two ways that Kierkegaard thinks people can approach a truth. 
He calls them
 
 Approximation: The method of knowing that’s characteristic of objec-
tive, scientific truths about things.
 
 Appropriation: The method of knowing that’s characteristic of subjec-
tive, essential truths about your own personal existence.
Approximation: The scientific route
Suppose that you approach your ideal through approximation. You’ve looked 
at all the rational reasons why living by such an ideal makes sense, and 
you’ve accumulated evidence in its favor. You know it’s not certain, but you 
think the evidence is compelling. You have enough evidence to feel confident 
about pursuing your ideal. In fact, with each new piece of evidence you col-
lect, you take yourself to be closer and closer to the truth.
 
This is approximation. The problem with this method, Kierkegaard thinks, is 
that it treats truth as something external to you. Whether you take your ideal 
to be true depends on evidence, and evidence is public and common. And that 
means the truth of that idea isn’t reliant upon you at all. Anybody who sees 
the evidence should be convinced of its truth. Essentially, the motivation to 
pursue this ideal doesn’t need to come from you.
But if the truth of that idea or the motivation to pursue it doesn’t depend on 
you, how can you be passionate about it? Essentially, Kierkegaard’s claim is 
that the better the evidence gets, the less the truth is yours and the less it can 
function as the object of your passion. Think about it: How excited do you get 
about the fact that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit? Probably not very! 
Well, it is objectively true, so why not? It’s clear — certain objective truths 
just don’t inspire a whole lot of passion in us.
 
Because of this problem, Kierkegaard insists that the approximate route to 
truth is a dead end when it comes to dealing with the personal questions cen-
tral to your existence.
This conclusion shouldn’t surprise you. When you turn to approximation to 
deal with personal questions about life and about existence, it’s clear that 
you don’t want to be deeply involved in the issue of your ideal’s truth. That 
would be too risky and would put too much responsibility on you. Turning to 
approximation shows a lack of courage. You don’t want risk or mystery. You 
want assurance from the outside that your choices are the right ones. You 
want life to make sense. You want your existence to yield to reason.

148
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Appropriation: The existential route
 
Do yourself a favor. If you’re going to use the method of approximation, save 
it for when you buy a new saw or for when you need medical advice. When it 
comes to choosing the ideals to live your life by, use appropriation instead. 
Instead of seeking evidence and proof to determine the truth of your ideal, 
recognize that really living your life requires that the truth be yours alone and 
that your motivation for pursuing it come from you, not from public evidence.
The only way to make a truth your own is to embrace it through sheer com-
mitment and inward passion; you need to make the decision to embrace this 
ideal with all you are. To embrace an objective uncertainty in appropriation 
means to live the truth, to make a leap of faith, and to commit to something 
not justified or grounded in evidence. That’s the leap, after all. You must leap 
over the uncertainty that opens between you and your idea; you must leap 
over it and bridge the gap between the two through a willed, passionate 
commitment.
Through the leap, you forge that ideal into a central component of your 
whole existence. The ideal becomes part of what you are and so becomes true 
through your way of embodying it and letting it shape your life. Essentially, 
although scientific truths have to be discovered through approximation, sub-
jective truths are created through appropriation.
 
Be honest. Haven’t you had moments like this, even if they were brief? Didn’t 
you feel real at such moments? As though only at that moment you really 
began to exist and to live? As though you finally had truth on your side? For 
the existentialists, only during such times are you a true embodiment of what 
it means to be an authentic person. In appropriation, you’ve given up the 
attempt to make life easy and understandable. You’re forging ahead into the 
world of the unknown, truly blazing a path of your own.
The crowd is untruth
 
Kierkegaard writes, “There is a view of life which holds that where the crowd 
is, the truth is also, that it’s a need in truth itself, that it must have the crowd 
on its side.” The existentialists (and most reasonable people, if you ask us) 
are fiercely opposed to crowd-driven conformity. Sadly, most people don’t 
act until they know what the crowd thinks. For them, the crowd is truth. For 
Kierkegaard, it’s the opposite: The crowd is untruth.
In arguing against conformity, Kierkegaard points out St. Paul’s suggestion 
in the Bible that “only one receives the prize.” Although St. Paul’s meaning 
is clearly religious, you can take Kierkegaard’s point in a more general way 
(having nothing to do with the Highlander TV series, by the way; existential-
ism isn’t about cutting off people’s heads). Kierkegaard suggests that living 

149
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
authentically, or living in truth, can occur only to an individual. Passionately 
living life to the fullest can’t occur for a person as a member of a group 
because in the crowd, you aren’t an individual. As a result, “the prize” must 
be claimed outside the hands of the crowd. To win it, you must face exis-
tence alone.
As we explain in the next few sections, Kierkegaard has some reasons for 
thinking that crowd-dwellers are forever losers in the game of life.
The crowd believes only what’s authorized by many
The logical fallacy (form of bad reasoning) known as the appeal to the people 
occurs when you suggest that something is true because a majority of people 
believe it’s true.
Although clearly problematic (the earth isn’t flat even if lots of people say 
it is), Kierkegaard is more concerned with the way of approaching life that 
this fallacy embodies. Specifically, crowd-dwelling requires a detachment 
from your own life. The crowd-dweller avoids (mostly due to fear) grappling 
with how to respond to the very concrete and particular situations he lives 
through. The crowd-dweller doesn’t want to take on the risk of embracing 
an individual path. Instead, he detaches from his own existence and seeks to 
express what’s common to everyone’s experiences, losing touch with his own 
particular life. What he does and his motivation for pursuing it aren’t his own.
The crowd embraces anonymity
As you detach from the realities of your own individual life and seek to 
submerge yourself within the crowd, you begin to live as a shadow without 
real substance. Your desire to live as an expression of everyone means you 
reject the need to be a particular person with a particular name. You take no 
positions on existence that reveal you as an individual chooser. As a face in 
the crowd, you’re successfully hidden and anonymous. When you do take 
positions, you simulate living by taking on false commitments as a group 
member. For example, you don’t commit to fidelity to your spouse; “good 
Christians” do! Simulated life is like the life that you watch an actor portray 
on stage. The actor is playing a role. The actor isn’t committed as an indi-
vidual to what he’s doing. When you do things “as good Christians do” or “as 
good fathers do,” you’re playacting through life. As an individual, you don’t 
exist.
The crowd is cowardice and false courage
Individual existence requires great courage. You have to stand on your own 
two feet and face up to the mysteries and risk involved in making your own 
decisions about living. After you’re safely hidden within the group, your 
choices can’t be risky, because everyone understands and approves them. 
Best of all, if your choices don’t work out, everyone is at fault, and all can 
share the blame.

150
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
As Kierkegaard puts it, in the crowd each individual “contributes his share 
of cowardice to ‘the cowardice’ which is the crowd.” Of course, although the 
crowd is cowardice, within it people quickly acquire a false feeling of courage. 
No wonder: Within the crowd, people become willing to carry out actions that 
they otherwise may not. Think of a crowd riot. Although it’s possible that no 
one person has the courage to riot, you can hide behind your anonymity as 
a crowd dweller and avoid the consequences of your actions. In your hidden 
form, you’ve become unaccountable. You draw a false strength from your 
invisibility and from the sheer numbers around you.
 
Performing an action when everyone’s in it together is easy; performing an 
action in isolation and in full view, when everyone knows it’s you, is really 
living. Real courage comes from within, not from without. If risk, mystery, pas-
sion, and devoted commitment to a path that gives expression to one’s indi-
vidual existence are what mark living in truth, living in the crowd is clearly the 
sign of untruth. You must take the business of individual existence seriously; 
the more people who are around, the harder getting down to that business in 
a meaningful way will be.
Why Modern Life Drains You of Passion
To Kierkegaard, the present age — the world of his time (and our own) — had 
lost its fire and passion. Unlike the more revolutionary times of past, the 
present age prefers the easy life. Those within it look for ways to distract 
themselves from the difficulties of engaging meaningfully with existence.
Socrates the crowd-hater
If you want to live in the crowd, you need a 
few skills. You need to be good at appeasing 
those around you. You have to make them feel 
good about themselves. You need to be a good 
social chameleon, to be sure your way of acting 
assures others that you’re one of them. If that 
means moving from one belief or behavior to 
another in different situations, do it. You need 
to become what the ancient Greeks called a 
sophist. Sophists were notoriously uninterested 
in truth and cared more about persuasion and 
rhetoric. Socrates lived as an antisophist, and 
he paid the ultimate price for doing it. Socrates 
avoided crowds and preferred to speak only 
to individuals. He felt, as Kierkegaard did, that 
truth wasn’t in the domain of the crowd but 
belonged only to individuals. In fact, Socrates 
felt that individuals needed to free themselves 
from the crowd’s alleged wisdom and learn to 
approach existence truthfully. In spurning the 
crowd in this way, he made lots of enemies, 
some of whom put him to death on false 
charges. In fact, in his defense trial (described 
in Plato’s Apology), Socrates told the Athenian 
assembly — the crowd that would judge him — 
that he would not treat them in the ways crowds 
like to be treated. He told them that he would 
not flatter them and play to their cowardice.

151
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
One of the focuses of Kierkegaard’s attack on the modern age is the printed 
media. Through it, he feels, people are tempted to become part of the larger 
abstraction known as the crowd or the public. The main concern is that the 
media entices people to become superficially involved in trivial issues distant 
from their own lives. Because passionate people are deeply engaged with 
the concrete lives of their own circumstances, these temptations drain you of 
your engagement with your own particular life. As a consequence, they help 
make you dispassionate, phony, and shallow.
To end this chapter, we look at whether Kierkegaard’s attack on the media, 
and his attack on the modern age, would be extended to the Internet age that 
we live in; we’re pretty sure it would have!
The present age is so dull
Kierkegaard is convinced (and Nietzsche too — check out Chapter 11) that 
people are living in an age of putrid mediocrity. In the present age, people 
don’t want to live; instead, they want to feel as though they’re living. The 
present age is attracted to simulation. In short, the present age loves playact-
ing about life and therefore enjoys self-deceptive fantasies about life. What 
could be duller or staler?
Kierkegaard’s Fire Chief
To hammer home the message of crowd cow-
ardice, Kierkegaard talks about the Fire Chief. 
When a fire happens, he says, it’s serious busi-
ness. The Fire Chief knows that when he arrives 
at the scene, the surrounding crowd will be 
brandishing useless pitchforks and buckets. 
They’re not serious about the fire, but they want 
to play at being serious because that’s what 
crowds do. At best, they’re a nuisance to the 
firefighters, but at worst, they’re dangerous and 
get in the way. As a result, the Fire Chief rightly 
uses the police to disperse the crowd.
In developing this analogy, Kierkegaard is 
asking a simple question: Are you willing to take 
your own existence seriously, as the Fire Chief 
treats the business of putting out fires? If so, 
you’ll have to make passionate commitments 
about how to live. Of course, when the crowd 
hears that you’re addressing how to live your 
life, it will immediately show up to prove that it 
takes the issues under consideration very seri-
ously, and it’ll demand that you pay attention to 
it as proof of your own seriousness. However, 
just as in the scene of the fire, the crowd is 
merely waving figurative pitchforks; it’s danger-
ous to you in your quest because it wants you 
to live in untruth.
What will you say as the Fire Chief in charge of 
your own life? You can’t call the police (unless 
the crowd is waving real pitchforks). You have 
to send them away on your own if you plan on 
living in a meaningful way. Will you? Do you 
have the courage?

Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In his criticism of modern times, Kierkegaard draws a distinction between 
two different approaches to life. He calls one the present age (which is the 
modern period) and the other the revolutionary age. Kierkegaard says that 
the revolutionary age is marked by
 
 A devotion to subjectivity
 
 A commitment to action
 
 A willingness to embrace great passion
 
 A cultivation of risk and danger
The revolutionary age is one that’s deeply rooted in subjectivity and truth, 
which we discuss earlier in the chapter. In the revolutionary age, people take 
their existences seriously. They take chances with their lives. They make 
ambitious plans and live them out, and the people around those who live this 
way applaud them. Passionate people in a revolutionary age are exemplars.
 
One way to think of the revolutionary age is to think of the Klingons in the TV 
series Star Trek. The Klingons are a warrior race dedicated to fighting battles. 
Every day they seek out danger, trying to constantly push the envelope. When 
they die, others sing songs of remembrance — testaments to their right (and 
true!) way of living. Klingons don’t fear death; to them, it’s a necessary part of 
living. Their motto: “Today is a good day to die!”
Not in the present age. According to Kierkegaard, people in the present age 
adore
 
 Objectivity and science
 
 Endless deliberation but no decision-making
 
 Safety as opposed to danger
 
 Appearance and not reality
In the present age, people like to feel alive but don’t want to make the kinds 
of decisions needed to really live that way. Kierkegaard says that in the pres-
ent age, people meet and plan rebellions, deliberating furiously over details 
about what should go into the revolutionary document. Tired, they call it 
a day and go home to dinner feeling as though they’ve done something, as 
though they actually participated in a rebellion. Maybe they’ll do it all over 
again tomorrow.
People in the present age love science and reason and don’t trust themselves 
to make decisions about how to live. They spend lots of time in the self-help 
section of the bookstore, looking for those how-to books that tell them how 
to live their lives correctly. Essentially, they dedicate themselves to the pur-
suit of distraction because it gives the illusion that they’re actually doing 
something when they’re always really standing still.

153
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
To use another Star Trek analogy, the present age would love the holodeck. 
In the Star Trek universe, the holodeck is a computer simulation that allows 
you to live any kind of experience you want, no matter how dangerous, at no 
actual risk to yourself. You can simulate dangerous life at no cost. In the rev-
olutionary age, people actually did the things the present age plays out in the 
holodeck. In the present age, people who simulate life effectively are seen as 
smart. They exhibit “good sense” by playing it safe. To those in the present 
age, those seen in the revolutionary age as exemplars are really total idiots.
Kierkegaard’s attack on the media
Living with passion is a central existentialist concern. Of course, one way 
to erode passion — life in the crowd — will always exist as a possibility in 
the world you live in. However, as technology increases, the ability — and 
pressure — to incorporate yourself into the crowd becomes harder and 
harder to avoid. Technology makes the crowd more and more a part of the 
everyday world so that it’s no longer something you have to seek out.
Kierkegaard is very worried about the growing presence of the printed media, 
because he sees them as the voice of the crowd or the public. Before the 
media’s emergence, the influence and temptation of the crowd were limited 
to word of mouth. The size of the crowd was limited to the number of people 
who could congregate. But the printed press allows the crowd to reach out to 
and pull in even more people into its clutches through the media.
The main issue Kierkegaard has with the media is their ability to serve as a 
temptation to detach from actual lived existence. Think about it. Newspapers, 
television shows, and talk radio tempt you to superficially involve yourself 
in topics that you know little about and that have no relevance to the con-
crete issues that you, as an individual, ought to be grappling with. Instead of 
becoming committed to living your own individual life, you’re hypnotized by 
what “They” say about Paris Hilton and Britney Spears or by what’s going on 
politically in an area 2,000 miles from where you live.
The media demand that you have more and more opinions about more and 
more topics. They seek to divide your attention until it’s so thin that you can 
spend only minutes on each topic, essentially making your connection to the 
issues superficial. Of course, another reason the media are so dangerous is 
that they give the crowd an ever greater appearance of strength, scope, and 
objectivity. Eventually, the temptations of the media are too great for many 
to resist. Eventually, as the Borg says in Star Trek: The Next Generation, resis-
tance is futile. The omnipresent temptations of the media eventually assure 
that all people are eventually assimilated into “the public.”

154
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
Think of the number of people deeply trapped in the pages of The National 
Enquirer and Star Magazine or angrily perusing the editorial pages of the news-
paper, upset about people’s opinions concerning topics distant to their local-
ized world. Funny thing is, they can’t seem to pull themselves away from it! 
It’s like a drug addiction. People are drawn to the safety of dealing with others’ 
issues rather than their own.
The media also tempt you to participate in gossip-mongering or opinion-trading. 
They invite you to insert your opinion without having to make any real 
commitments and without any real risks. In the media of Kierkegaard’s time, 
newspapers allowed for the highlighting of opinions and beliefs that had no 
identifiable source; authors used pseudonyms.
 
Just as hiding in the crowd creates a false feeling of courage, Kierkegaard 
writes that through the press, a man can profess “things which he perhaps did 
not in the least have the courage to say personally in a particular situation; 
every time he opens up his gullet — one cannot call it a mouth — he can all at 
once address himself to thousands upon thousands.”
Kierkegaard fiercely believes that real passionate living means a nonsuperfi-
cial, real involvement with issues that affect your life. It means investing your 
time and your commitment in choices, because you don’t have unlimited 
time, and real involvement requires you to dedicate yourself to one pursuit 
as opposed to another. The press allows you to avoid making those either/or 
choices. You can do it all! Dabble a little here and a little there. No commit-
ments needed, no choices. No time investment. No consequences. The press 
functions to undermine real commitments and in so doing, it undermines you.
The Corsair incident
Kierkegaard’s antagonism toward the media 
originated out of personal experience; he knew 
well how the inner workings of the press func-
tioned. Copenhagen had a number of what were 
most likely tabloids circulating in Kierkegaard’s 
time, the most popular being The Corsair. Like 
some modern tabloids and television shows, 
The Corsair took it upon itself to publicly lam-
poon high-status residents of Copenhagen with 
insult and ridicule. Kierkegaard, who had long 
had a favorable relationship with the journal, 
invited the journal to attack him. It did, maliciously 
running attack piece after attack piece insulting 
his physical appearance and his demeanor and 
exposing him to a high degree of public ridicule. 
Did Kierkegaard actually want this separation 
from Copenhagen? Perhaps the philosopher 
who so strongly championed individuality felt 
he wasn’t sufficiently separate from the crowd. 
In any event, his separation from society did, in 
fact, result in a remarkably productive period of 
writing, some of which discussed how certain 
kinds of communication typical of the media fre-
quently exhibit inauthenticity.

155
 Chapter 7: Not Tonight, Honey: Why We Need More Passion in Our Lives
The Internet: A modern passion-killer?
Although Kierkegaard is probably right that the modern media tend to suc-
ceed in distracting people from the task of grappling with their own con-
crete existence, a new foe has emerged on the horizon: the Internet. Should 
Kierkegaard’s attack on the media extend to the Internet? Our answer (as is 
the opinion of Hubert Dreyfus, a contemporary philosopher who has written 
extensively on this subject) is yes!
Knowledge: No passion required
First, think of the question of knowledge. Whereas knowledge was once the 
realm of committed experts who passionately dedicated their time to study-
ing concrete issues and took the risks that such dedication requires, the 
Internet has introduced a different view of knowledge. Instead of understand-
ing that knowing something requires time and effort, people now have bil-
lions of Web sites to choose among. They just need a search engine.
The fact that perusing this information requires no risk, no commitment, and 
no time investment invites people to become what Kierkegaard calls “intel-
lectual tourists.” You dabble here, you dabble there; no degree of superficial-
ity is low enough to stop a person from becoming an expert in everything. 
Don’t like what an expert said about X? Type it into a search engine, and in 10 
seconds you can play at being a serious devotee to that question. On some 
sites, anyone can be a contributor, no expertise needed. You can act just like 
an expert in no time without actually getting involved. Sure, you don’t really 
understand the issues, but armed with your informational sound bites, you 
look like you do.
Relationships: Idle and superficial
And what about relationships with others? No need to actually get involved 
with people anymore — you can just use the social-interaction Web sites 
that so many people use. After you’re there, you create your own identity, 
whether it accurately represents you or not. You acquire as many virtual 
friends as you can. (You want to be Net-popular, right?)
Clearly, these friendships aren’t necessarily real. You can’t just press a 
button and be friends with someone. One site even allows the user to join up 
with causes. That used to mean actually doing something in support of the 
cause. What does it require now? Press the button for the cause you desire; 
your identity profile now lists you as a supporter for everyone to see. You’re 
playacting again, and all from the easy comfort of your computer chair!

156
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
Is the Internet helping make your relationship with the world and with others 
more superficial? Do you find yourself on instant messenger often, having long 
conversations consisting of five-word sentences? What are these conversa-
tions about, other than just a desperate attempt to keep from being bored? 
Are you reducing your relationships to mere chitchat, to what 20th-century 
existentialist Martin Heidegger calls “idle talk”? (Check out Chapter 6 to read 
more about what Heidegger says.)
Kierkegaard surely wouldn’t have wanted to banish the Internet. These tech-
nologies often have positive effects on relationships and human interaction. 
For significant numbers of people, using these sorts of media may actually 
help reinforce existing networks of friends and family. So they don’t have 
only the negative effect of helping people escape real-world relationships to 
engage in a risk-free fantasy world.
Kierkegaard, if he were alive today, would likely acknowledge this. But he 
would have wanted people to be very careful about how they use such tech-
nology and to be always mindful of its tendency to distract them from the 
realities of living as human beings. In short, he would have thought that the 
Internet is like all other technological gadgets we can become so addicted to; 
we should make the Internet work for us, not allow it to absorb us and dis-
tract us from living in a really passionate way.

Sar tre’s Existentialism: Learning 
to Cope with Freedom
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of Sartre’s “Existentialism”
 Living with your freedom
 Creating value and meaning
 Coping with existential psychology
V
ariously known as “Existentialism,” “The Humanism of Existentialism,” 
and “Existentialism Is a Humanism,” Jean-Paul Sartre’s most widely read 
essay was an attempt to clarify the meaning of the existential movement at a 
time when its popularity was near its zenith. Although not written for profes-
sional philosophers, like much of his work it’s meandering, frustrating, end-
lessly brilliant, and at times opaque. One of Sartre’s main goals was to defend 
existentialism from attacks and misconceptions, many of which persist to 
this day. The two groups he most clearly addresses are the Communists and 
the Christians. In today’s terms, you may say he was fending off attacks from 
both the Left and the Right. Sartre himself identified more with the Left. We 
discuss politics more in Chapter 12, but for now it’s sufficient to point out 
that Sartre was personally committed to socialism and that both he and his 
philosophy were overtly atheistic.
Partially due to the fact that “Existentialism” (as we refer to the essay) was 
meant to be a defense of his philosophy, Sartre focuses on the optimism 
inherent in the existentialist movement as he sees it. It’s a strange, tough kind 
of optimism, but in the end, it is optimistic. The source of this optimism, for 
Sartre, is the freedom of man. We use more gender-neutral language in the rest 
of the chapter, but we think it worth throwing that in there to make a couple 
of points about Sartre. First, it’s the language Sartre used, but, more important, 
we feel in his case that it wasn’t just a product of his time. People love to debate 
whether and how much of a sexist Sartre was, and also how significantly his 
gender and his issues with masculinity and with women slanted his philosophy. 
We don’t go deep into this kind of analysis, but we think many of Sartre’s literary 
and philosophical ideas are distinctly masculine. Which ideas, and how much so, 
we leave to you to decide.

158
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In this chapter, we discuss some of the major themes and ideas of 
“Existentialism,” particularly as they pertain to the idea of freedom, which is 
central for many existentialists. Because Sartre sometimes lights on a subject 
and then moves on, bringing in details from his wider philosophy helps make 
sense of what he says. Sartre is kind of like that philosophy professor who 
starts talking to you about the squirrel problem in his backyard and then six 
topics later comes back to the squirrels, dismissively saying, “But that prob-
lem is really just a side effect of the military–industrial complex’s hold on the 
current administration.” Uh-huh. We help you connect the dots back to the 
squirrels (in a manner of speaking).
We start with an examination of what it means to be free and why Sartre has 
such a strong and unrelenting notion of the breadth and depth of our free-
dom. Then we explain one of Sartre’s most important concepts — the idea 
that our existence precedes our essence — and what this principle has to do 
with our freedom. (Hint: everything!) As we mention earlier, “Existentialism” 
presents a tough-minded optimism. We explain why freedom is such a tough 
road, why Sartre thinks — to use another of his most famous phrases — 
we’re “condemned” to be free, but also why freedom is so important and why 
it’s a source of hope. Like many of the existentialists, Sartre was concerned 
with human psychology and how one copes with a life without any inherent 
meaning. He was particularly influential on a movement in psychology that 
aimed at dealing with this issue. In Chapter 14, we discuss these folks and 
how Sartre influenced them.
What Does It Mean to Be Free?
We hear and talk a lot about freedom. Everyone wants to be free, right? 
People fight wars for freedom on the assumption that everyone wants it. 
Sartre and the other existentialists may take issue with that assumption, but 
the first question you have to answer is what freedom is.
In one sense, freedom is living without constraint. This is a popular way of 
thinking about freedom today. You’re free if nothing gets in your way: Mom 
and Dad, oppressive regimes at home and abroad, your boss (you know, the 
Man). You can also point to internal constraints such as mental illness, drug 
addiction, and maybe even genetics. If you’re genetically disposed to like 
potato chips more than tomatoes, are you free to lead the heart-healthy life-
style your doctor recommends? If all humans are genetically disposed to prefer 
the chips, if preferring them is part of human nature, everyone is in trouble. 
Judging from the rising heart-disease rates, something like this scenario just 
may be the case. The question constantly asked today, then, is “Are people 
free?” Was this or that person free when she performed a certain act?
Sartre rejects all this business about constraints. His answer to the final two 
questions is yes. It’s always yes, because people are always free.

159
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Freedom means always having a choice
Freedom means different things to different people. If you can quit your job 
without starving or losing your home, you have economic freedom. If you can 
go to the church, mosque, synagogue, or temple you want, you have religious 
freedom. Many devout Christians crossed the Atlantic to exercise that kind 
of freedom in the New World. Some of them lost no time once they got here 
exercising their freedom to discriminate against others. In Christian and other 
theologies, each person has a choice between good and evil. What all these 
notions of freedom have in common is choice. If you have economic freedom, 
you can choose to quit your job, or choose to go to the Bahamas and stay at a 
first-class resort. If you have religious freedom, you can choose which religious 
services to attend or maybe to not go at all. A big enough group of people may 
even have the freedom to choose to curtail the freedom of others.
You’re free, then, when you have a choice. The exact nature of that choice 
can vary, but when you have a choice, you have freedom. Sartre contends 
that people always have a choice and therefore are always free. Having the 
constant luxury and responsibility to make a choice is part of the human con-
dition. Why? Because no matter what your situation is, you choose that situa-
tion. Sartre believes this for four main reasons:
 
 You choose how to interpret your situation.
 
 You choose how to react to your situation.
 
 In particular, you choose whether to remain in your situation.
 
 Any part of your situation that you don’t choose is irrelevant.
 
That last point may seem like a bit of a cheat — as though anything that doesn’t 
fit into Sartre’s way of thinking just “doesn’t count” — but it’s integral to not only 
his worldview, but also to the existentialists’ view in general. The existentialists 
are absolutely committed to a vision of honesty that insists upon facing the 
world, facing life as is. Even the Christian existentialists tend to see traditional 
religion as a dodge for facing the hard truth that life is fundamentally mean-
ingless. Nietzsche says, “God is dead” largely to stress that no God or heaven 
could give meaning to life after the fact. If life is to be redeemed, it must be this 
life as it’s handed to us. That’s not to say you should refuse to engage in life, 
that you should accept life as it is and not try to change it. Quite the contrary. 
Sartre thinks that such engagement is crucial. What you must do, however, 
is engage the world on honest terms, starting from a view that acknowledges 
what your starting point really is. Saying, “But if I weren’t poor . . .” or “If I 
hadn’t been born in a time of war . . .” is no better than saying, “But if God 
could have given us a miracle . . .” or “If I were a superhero and could fly . . .” 
You start from where you are, but you move forward. In that moving forward, 
you always have a choice.

160
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Free choice means free action
In other works, Sartre refers to everything you can’t control as your facticity. 
The list of things you can’t control is fairly broad. For example, although Sartre 
says that there’s no human nature, he does concede that people have tempera-
ments, such as a quick temper or a nervous or shy disposition. Your nature, what 
you are, is something you create, but your temperament may simply be an 
uncontrollable fact you have to live with. Your native nationality, whether you 
were born rich or poor, the political circumstances you live in — these factors 
are all out of your immediate control.
 
Your facticity is at once very broad and very narrow. Take a look at your life in 
360 degrees. Look at everything, but don’t think about it. Look at it as a frozen 
movie still. Your job may require that you be at work at 8 a.m.; you may be an 
American, French, or Chinese citizen. Your parents and upbringing may be rich 
or poor. You may have inherited a quick mind from your mother and an impa-
tient temperament from your father. At this writing, you live in a time of uncer-
tainty and war, and this environment may affect your life directly or indirectly. 
All this composes your facticity at this moment.
Now unfreeze the snapshot. As soon as things start moving, you get involved. 
The 8 a.m. start time isn’t just a fact; it’s a fact that you live, and in living it, 
you choose it in a number of ways. First, you choose it because you don’t quit 
your job. “But I need to pay my rent,” you say. Then you choose it to pay the 
rent, but you choose it nonetheless. You could choose another job to pay the 
rent, or you could risk homelessness while searching for another job. Or you 
could even choose homelessness. The fact that a choice is unattractive to you 
doesn’t mean that it isn’t a choice.
You also have a choice in how you see the facts of your situation. Do you to 
see the 8 a.m. start time as an inconvenience? As a way of jump-starting your 
day? If your constitution is like coauthor Greg’s, you aren’t a morning person, 
and you may see an 8 a.m. start to your day as a hideous inconvenience and 
proof of a vengeful God intent on punishing you for your existential ways. 
(Greg sympathizes; he feels this way some days.) But even if you have Greg’s 
constitution and not coauthor Chris’s popping-at-the-crack-of-dawn disposi-
tion, you can still view your 8 a.m. start as an opportunity.
 
As Sartre points out in “Existentialism,” “There’s no such thing as a cowardly 
constitution; there are nervous constitutions. . . . A constitution is not an act; 
the coward is defined on the basis of the acts he performs.”
And it’s in such acts that Sartre sees the fullest expression of freedom. 
Fundamentally, free choice is about action. No matter what confronts you, no 
matter what your constitution, you have a choice in how to respond, in how 
to act.

161
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Sartre brings all this together in the story of a young priest who had lived 
through a series of setbacks. He had grown up in poverty and experienced many 
humiliations stemming from this status. He hadn’t done particularly well in 
school. Later, he botched a love affair and failed in his military training. Now, as 
all these events were happening, the young priest certainly made a number of 
choices, but that wasn’t Sartre’s interest in the story. After your past has hap-
pened, it’s unchangeable and becomes a part of your situation to which you 
must respond. The young man in this story chose to look at all these trials and 
failures as a sign that he wasn’t meant for worldly success, and he entered the 
priesthood. You may think Sartre would reject this religious interpretation, but 
he actually embraces it as a perfect example of the freedom to choose how to 
view the facts that confront us and how we choose to act in response to them.
 
Of the young priest, Sartre wrote, “It was a sign of something, but of what? He 
might have taken refuge in bitterness or despair. But he wisely looked upon 
all this as a sign that he was not made for secular triumphs. . . . Who can help 
seeing that he alone decided what the sign meant?”
In many respects, life is something that happens to you, but you always 
choose how to interpret and respond to it. You are, therefore, always free. In 
any situation, a number of choices are available to you. Admittedly, some of 
these choices may be extreme or unpleasant, but they’re present nonetheless.
Our most basic choice is living
One of the characteristics that makes us free is the fact that we can always 
pull out of a situation. You can quit your job, you can accept not paying the 
rent, you can say no. The ultimate expression of this fact is, for many of the 
existentialists and Sartre in particular, that a person can always choose sui-
cide. (Check out our cartoon in Figure 8-1.) Therefore, every situation is one 
you choose because you could always get out of it.
Try this yourself: Freeze frame
Think about your life, and freeze it for a moment. 
Look around at all the facts that make up your 
life history and current situation. Find ten things 
that you didn’t decide upon and can’t control. 
Now, like a movie, set the scene rolling again, 
and look at your relation to those ten things. Ask 
yourself the following questions:
  How do I see these ten facts about my 
situation?
  Can I look at them another way?
  Can I walk away from them?
  Can I choose how to respond to and inter-
act with these aspects of my situation?
Sartre says the answer to the last three ques-
tions is always yes. Therefore, you’re always 
free and always choose your situation.

162

Figure 8-1: 
The notion 
that suicide 
is an alter-
native to 
your every 
choice 
seems 
rather 
absurd.
 
I haven’t used it yet, 
but it’s nice to know 
that the option is there
Suicide is always an option, albeit an unpleasant one
At first, this theory may seem extreme. Who looks at the alarm clock and 
says, “Well, I could get up and go to work, or I could kill myself”? We hope 
you don’t. Putting this argument into context and understanding a bit about 
Sartre’s life and times may make this argument seem more natural. Sartre didn’t 
just live through World War II; he was active in the French Resistance against 
the Nazis during their occupation of Paris. The war is a constant theme in his 
writing and a constant source of examples for him. As many of the French 
(including Sartre) saw it, those who lived through that time were sharply and 
simply divided between those who collaborated with the Nazis and those 
who resisted and said no to the situation that faced them.
When Sartre speaks of suicide, then, he isn’t raising it simply as an abstraction, 
but as a genuine choice that faced many of his countrymen and women. Many 
of those who resisted literally chose death rather than betray their fellows. 
As unthinkable as choosing death is for many people, Sartre is adamant that 
people must acknowledge that it is a choice that’s available. For the collabo-
rator to say “I had no choice” is dishonest because that choice was available, 
and others had the courage to make it. Strictly speaking, though, they didn’t 
have the courage to resist; they chose to act in that way, and in so doing 
made themselves courageous. (We discuss this concept further in the later 
sections “What Sartre Means by ‘Existence Precedes Essence’” and “Freedom 
Is So Important Because It Brings Hope.”)

163
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Facing mortality means engaging in life
Still, you may say that talk of death and suicide makes sense in the context 
of war but not in most people’s lives today. What relevance does the choice 
of suicide have for healthy, well-adjusted folks who are choosing whether to 
get a second mortgage on the house? The short answer is: everything. For the 
existentialist, you make every honest choice with the knowledge of your own 
mortality in the background. That’s the most fundamental element of your 
situation. The significance for Sartre is that death is always an option, always an 
available choice. It may not be one you would readily choose, but that doesn’t 
change the fact that it exists. After you honestly face the existence of that choice, 
the rest of your choices open up. If simply living is an active choice you make, 
how much more so is the choice to keep your job? To pay the rent? To go to 
work at (God help us) 8 a.m.? If you acknowledge that you could choose death, 
how can you deny all the other choices available to you, whether it’s leaving a 
spouse, angering your parents, or performing an honest act in the face of duress? 
If death is a real option, hard choices like these are real options, too — and 
saying that you couldn’t do this or that is disingenuous. Facing the reality of 
your own mortality is, for Sartre and the existentialists, an awakening experi-
ence. If you respond to it properly, if you don’t run from it, it heightens your 
awareness of your own inevitable engagement in life: the degree to which 
your life is a choice and the degree to which that choice is yours.
Human nature versus the human condition
Sartre repeatedly says that he doesn’t believe 
in an inherent, universal human nature, but he 
acknowledges a human condition. The differ-
ence is that the human condition is a set of facts 
that confront all people. We all live in a world 
with other people, we need food and shelter to 
survive, and we’re all mortal; this last item is 
the essence of the human condition for all exis-
tentialists. Human nature, on the other hand, is 
what it means to be human. It arises in large part 
from the meaning human beings choose to give 
to all the facts of the human condition and how 
they choose to respond to those conditions.
Human beings may have a lot in common, but 
none of this has meaning until we confront and 
live through those facts. It’s only when we start 
acting that we define our nature both as indi-
viduals and as human beings. It’s through those 
acts, performed in relation to a condition shared 
by other people but unique to ourselves, that 
we create human nature and our own nature. 
Are human beings cowardly? Are we inquisi-
tive? Good? Evil? In what sense? Do we strive 
toward something as human beings? These are 
the types of questions that Sartre thinks pertain 
to human nature and that he believes have no 
answer until human beings start making choices 
and acting in the world.

164
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
What Sartre Means by “Existence 
Precedes Essence”
Sartre argues in “Existentialism” that all existential thought is summed up in 
the phrase “Existence precedes essence.” Not everyone agrees that this is the 
definition (Heidegger, whom we discuss in detail in Chapter 9, was mortified 
by the assertion), but it’s certainly an important concept. To be more precise, 
what he’s saying is that, for human beings, our existence precedes our essence. 
Much clearer, right?
It will be clearer if we just get a handle on the notion of essence. When you 
say something is essential, you’re saying it’s necessary. If you make New 
England clam chowder and leave out the clams, well, you haven’t made New 
England clam chowder. (We’ve both spent a good deal of time in New England, 
and we won’t even be discussing that other chowder.) Clams are just part of 
the definition of clam chowder; they’re essential to making clam chowder what 
it is and not some other soup. The essence of something, then, is whatever 
makes it what it is. So by saying that existence precedes essence, Sartre means 
that human beings exist — are born and are conscious of their lives — before 
they really “are” anything. No crucial, necessary ingredient defines what a 
human being is. Nothing, in short, serves as an essence or nature that forces 
all human beings to be a certain preordained way. You have no human nature; 
there’s nothing you’re called or meant to do. You quite literally start as nothing.
We explain in the coming sections exactly what this means and what signifi-
cance it has, particularly for human freedom, responsibility, and value. You 
can think of freedom as a blank on a form you have to fill out. It’s there, but 
it exists only to be filled in with something else. In the case of human beings, 
that something else is who and what you are.
A human being is not a watch
Sartre explains the meaning of his most important phrase by comparing a 
human being with a manufactured item. We use a watch; Sartre uses a paper 
cutter, but the point is the same. A watch has a set function: It exists to tell 
time. Although some watches may be digital or contain pocketknives, if some-
thing didn’t tell you the time, you wouldn’t call it a watch. You could say 
(if you were feeling all philosophical) that telling time is a necessary feature of 
being a watch; that’s what makes it what it is. Furthermore, this function already 
exists in the mind of the watchmaker before he actually creates any given 
watch. No one sits down to make a watch without thinking, “I’m going to make 
something that tells time.” The watch’s essence — what it is to be a watch — 
precedes its actual existence because that essence, that purpose, was in the 
mind of the designer before the watch came into being.

165
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Two interesting characteristics about watches, then, are
 
 They have a fixed essence or definition. That is, at least part of what it 
means to be a watch is that a watch is an “object that tells time.” Doing 
so is a necessary part of being a watch.
 
 The essence is present before the actual watch is. The essence exists as 
an idea or a plan before the watch is created and actually guides its 
creation.
Sartre dramatically claims that if God doesn’t exist, this order is reversed for 
at least one object in the universe. Because God didn’t design us, we weren’t 
created with a plan in mind, as the watch was. Unlike the watch, we weren’t meant 
to serve a set function or realize a set pattern. When we’re born, we’re simply 
there, with no reason or meaning. No designer had any essence in mind, so we 
exist before that existence has any meaning, purpose, or definition.
So according to Sartre, we’re unlike the watch in two crucial ways:
 
 We have no fixed essence or definition. Being a human being has no 
inherent meaning; human nature doesn’t exist.
 
 We exist before we have any definition, purpose, or meaning.
Although the watch starts as an instrument for telling the time, we start as 
nothing, as a great emptiness or lack. Our only definition is that we’re beings 
that lack definition. But notice the words fixed and before. Definition, meaning, 
purpose — for human beings, these things come later. You aren’t born with 
them but must develop them on your own.
 
That’s why existence precedes essence. A human being is essentially a creature 
that creates its own essence. You must define yourself through your choices 
and actions. It’s only after exercising your free will and choosing how you’ll 
act in the world that you start to define yourself and develop or create a mean-
ing to your own existence.
Being human means being free
The most obvious consequence of the lack of human nature is that we’re free 
to create what we’ll become. But this makes it sound like you can choose 
who you’ll be if you want to. Rather, it’s more accurate to say that this free-
dom to make yourself, and your acting on this freedom, are what you are. 
In his more hyperbolic moments, Sartre goes so far as to say that a human 
being is freedom. He rejects the notion that this construction is a way of 
secretly acknowledging a human nature he claims doesn’t exist. To the extent 
that freedom is a nature, it’s only an empty nature waiting to be filled in. 
Think of your freedom as a blank on a form you have to fill out. It’s there, but 
it exists only to be filled in with something else.

Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Of watches and watchmakers
William Paley, an 18th-century Anglican priest 
and philosopher, made very different use of the 
idea of a watchmaker in his attempt to prove the 
existence of God. Paley’s argument asks you to 
imagine that you found a watch on the ground. 
Its complexity and the fact that this complexity 
was clearly developed with a particular func-
tion in mind would indicate the existence of a 
watchmaker who designed that watch.
Similarly, he argued, the complexity of human 
beings and the clear functions to which their 
various parts are adapted prove that they must 
be the creations of a cosmic designer. For 
example, the human eye shows evidence of 
design because it’s a complex object with an 
obvious function (seeing). Human beings, in this 
view, are the products of a cosmic designer 
who had a plan or function in mind for them.
Notice, however, that although the function of 
a part of a human being — such as a heart or 
an eye — seems clear and obvious, the func-
tion of the human being as a whole is less clear. 
Sartre was living after Nietzsche announced 
the death of God (see Chapter 3 for more on this 
concept), when the rightness and order of the 
universe were no longer accepted as a given. 
He wasn’t willing to so easily accept the notion 
that human beings have a divine origin and that 
this origin gives them a ready purpose as surely 
as a watch has one. On the contrary, Sartre 
turns the example on its head and states that 
human beings have no designated purpose or 
function precisely because they have no such 
“watchmaker” to build that purpose or function 
into them. They simply start as an emptiness, a 
lack of these things, a nothingness.

167
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Freedom, according to a certain singer-songwriter, is just another word for 
nothing left to lose. If existence precedes essence, we’re not only free to 
create ourselves; we’re also free of any inherent, built-in baggage. Because 
we’re nothing, nothing is compelling us or prejudicing our choices or our 
actions. Any choice is possible. That kind of freedom can be overwhelming, 
and Sartre doesn’t think it’s anything to take lightly.
In the next section, we explain why freedom is a great weight and why being 
free isn’t as simple as catching a wave and living a carefree existence. Sartre 
was no hippie, but a serious, even austere thinker with the soul of a moralist.
Condemned to Be Free (And Responsible) 
Whether You Like It or Not
Like Nietzsche, Sartre is wonderfully quotable. He’s the author of a deep, com-
plex, and highly detailed philosophy. But perhaps because that philosophy is 
deeply relevant to the project of living that everyone must undertake, Sartre 
expressed some of its most important and relevant tenets in short, powerful, 
and highly suggestive (if not particularly clear) language. We discuss the mean-
ing of the highly important phrase “Existence precedes essence” in the preced-
ing section. Another central tenet of Sartre’s philosophy is that human beings 
are “condemned to be free.” To some extent, the phrase is rhetorical; no judge 
sentences you to freedom. Certainly, the atheist Sartre didn’t believe God was 
behind it! What he means, in part at least, is that being free is a fundamental 
part of the human condition and that we can’t escape our freedom.
Being “condemned” sounds pretty ominous, though. (We include a little car-
toon about it in Figure 8-2.) And Sartre calls this an optimistic philosophy? 
Well, yes, he does. But it’s always an optimism about where we can go from 
where we start. This discussion deals with the human condition — the start-
ing place, which he admits can look pretty bleak at times. The sense in which 
that starting place (freedom) is something we’re “condemned” to basically 
has the following two aspects:
 
 The first aspect is the aforementioned inescapability of that freedom. You’re 
free in life to make many choices, but whether you’ll be free isn’t one of 
them. It’s an inescapable part of your human condition, like it or not.
 
 The second aspect is the weight of freedom. You experience your free-
dom as a great burden because it’s a tremendous responsibility. If your 
freedom is inescapable, so is your responsibility.

168
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Responsibility is the other side of the freedom coin, and it’s also at the heart 
of Sartre’s philosophy, which asserts that you’re totally free and totally 
responsible. Responsibility itself has two elements:
 
 If you’re responsible for something, you (ideally) have some kind of 
power or control over the outcome. If your boss said to you, “Johnson, 
you’re responsible for sales for the fourth quarter, but you won’t have 
any authority over the sales department. In fact, you’ll be working for 
maintenance fixing toilets,” you’d be understandably confused and prob-
ably a bit peeved.
 
 Further, being responsible for something suggests that it matters some-
how, that something is at stake. It’s only with a bemused grin to other 
adults that parents give children “responsibility” for tasks like counting 
the number of blue cars they pass on a long road trip. Real responsibility 
involves things you care about in one way or another.
In the case of freedom, the responsibility you bear is, in a very real sense, 
for everything you care about. If you want to know exactly what’s at stake 
and why freedom is so important, read the section “Freedom Is So Important 
Because It Brings Hope,” later in this chapter. For the rest of this section, we 
explain why this freedom and this responsibility you bear for your choices 
are inescapable.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Freedom 
means 
responsi-
bility, and 
that can be 
tough to 
face.
 
You’re free
to go!
Can’t you get
me a reprieve?!?!

169
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
The inescapability of choice
Choice is inescapable because of the type of beings we are. Unlike a stone or 
a watch, we’re conscious. We have what Sartre refers to as subjectivity. His 
notion of it is taken directly from the French philosopher René Descartes, 
who famously said, “I think, therefore I am.”
“I think, therefore I am”
Most people have heard this famous quotation, but few really know what it 
means. Think of that weird, late-night discussion you’ve probably had (unless 
maybe it’s just us existential types) in which someone eventually asks, “But 
wait — what if all this is just a dream?” Strange-flavored brownies may or 
may not be involved in such discussions. Descartes, although probably 
brownieless, was trying to figure out how we can be certain of anything. How 
do you know whether what you believe is true? To answer this question, he 
performed a thought experiment in which he tried to doubt every belief he 
had. He was looking for one belief he absolutely couldn’t doubt. He found he 
was able to doubt quite a lot, including the existence of the entire physical 
universe and his own body. The only thing he couldn’t doubt was the exis-
tence of a thinker (himself) who was doubting. So he proclaimed the one fact 
he could be certain of was that he existed: “I think, therefore I am.”
In building his philosophy, which is all about knowledge, Descartes starts 
with this subjective viewpoint, with his own consciousness, and builds every-
thing else from there. This creates a separation in his philosophy (and in 
many later philosophies) between consciousness and the rest of the world. 
In this view, the human body is conceptually distinct from the human mind, 
or consciousness. You look out at the world, you see it, taste it, smell it, and 
interact with it, but you seem somehow different. Unlike most of the objects 
you perceive, you’re aware of yourself and of other objects. Most important, 
you look out on the objects in the world and make judgments about them. For 
Descartes, the main judgments involved are “believe” and “don’t believe.”
Consciousness is constantly choosing
Sartre adopts this point of view — the view of starting with consciousness — 
not on particularly existentialist grounds, but simply on the basis of the fact 
that he thinks Descartes is right. Sartre thinks that our own consciousness 
is the one certainty we all start with and that it’s from this subjective view-
point that we each look out onto the world. But although Descartes thinks 
we fundamentally judge statements to be true or false by looking out from 
our consciousness, Sartre feels that our fundamental act is to choose how to 
interpret and interact with the outside world.
For Sartre, the first act of consciousness is to choose. Consciousness, in itself, 
is nothing. It becomes something only as it makes these choices. This is what 
makes us different from all the other objects in the universe. Most objects 
simply are what they are. They’re complete, in a sense, in themselves. A rock 

170
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
is a rock. It doesn’t need to do anything or have anything added to it to be 
what it is. In other words, the universe is filled with objects that, if they could 
talk, would sound a lot like Popeye, saying, “I yam what I yam, and that’s all 
that I yam.”
Human beings are, in one sense, objects in the world. As such, they simply 
are what they are — 5-foot-2-inch, pinkish, hairy blobs of tissue, bone, and 
blood, for example. But unlike other objects, we also create what we are and 
what we’ll become. We’re subjects — conscious beings — that create what 
we are through the choices we make. The point isn’t simply that conscious-
ness can do this, but that this is what consciousness does by its very nature. 
Whereas other objects, like rocks and watches, simply are, a consciousness 
is constantly creating itself by constantly choosing.
  
Existence- Essence 
Subjectivity
Emptiness
Because human exis-
tence precedes human 
essence, human beings 
start as nothing. You’re 
nothing before you 
start making choices.
Consciousness, or sub-
jectivity, in itself is 
nothing. It becomes 
something only as it 
makes choices.
We’re different 
from objects
An object’s essence is 
predetermined, but hu-
man beings create their 
essence only later.
Objects simply are 
what they are. In one 
sense, humans are 
objects, but as sub-
jectivity, human beings 
create what they are.
Our nature, 
to the extent 
that we have 
one . . .
. . . is to create ourselves, 
because we have no 
essence.
. . . is to choose, 
which is the activity 
that allows us to cre-
ate ourselves.
You bear sole responsibility 
for your choices
Because to live is to choose, you’re perpetually under the weight of this 
responsibility to choose. Not only can you not avoid choosing, but you also 
can’t avoid the responsibility for that choice. The subjective position that 
Sartre’s philosophy starts with is a very lonely position. Many things come 
before you for your consideration; you need to review many things for inter-
pretation and response. But like Harry Truman said, the buck stops here, with 
you, and with each of us. As things parade by you for your consideration, noth-
ing compels you to make any particular choice, and nothing can comfort you by 
taking responsibility for that choice away from you.

171
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
 
Imagine your consciousness as a chief executive officer at a big desk. The facts 
and situations of your life continually parade across your consciousness, like 
proposals for your consideration. No one is sitting next to you in your con-
sciousness; no one helps you interpret what comes across or decides for you 
what to approve, what to reject, what to choose, and how to respond. It’s up 
to you to review each “proposal” and make the decision.
As an atheist, Sartre can’t accept God as the justification for our actions. 
But really, even if God exists, it makes no difference. Like everything else 
that crosses your desk, the word of God is just one more thing you’d have 
to interpret for yourself and choose how to respond to. The truth of this 
principle becomes evident if you consider the vast number of religions and 
interpretations of the Bible, Koran, or any other holy work. You may say you 
choose something because God or your preacher says so, but really, you 
choose how to interpret and respond to what God or the preacher says. You 
even choose which preacher at which church to listen to in the first place. 
This is why, even if God exists, the situation from the human perspective 
remains the same. Choice is still ultimately in your hands alone.
 
Sartre calls this sense of being alone in decision-making forlornness. He illus-
trates it beautifully with a story about a student who came to him for advice. 
The young man’s mother absolutely lived for him; she had no one else. The 
son didn’t want to betray and abandon her, but he also felt a responsibility to 
his countrymen to fight the Nazis, and felt he could best do this by traveling 
to Britain to join the French air force based there while France was occupied. 
The young man couldn’t decide what to do.
Connecting the dots: Subjectivity and 
“existence precedes essence”
If you read “Existentialism,” you may be mysti-
fied by Sartre’s claim that the notion that “exis-
tence precedes essence” is the same as saying 
that “subjectivity is the starting point.” After 
all, he never really explains exactly how this 
is so. Because we promise in the introduction 
to this chapter that we’ll help you connect the 
dots, we’re taking a moment to connect these 
two big ideas in Sartre’s philosophy. Although 
we’re leery of saying that these two statements 
are the same (American philosophers are 
notoriously slow to admit that two different 
things are really the same, no matter what 
famous French philosophers say), what Sartre 
is trying to express with both of these state-
ments is that human beings start as nothing. To 
make the connection between each of these 
statements more clear, take a look at some of 
the parallels that exist between the story of 
subjectivity we just described and the notion 
that existence precedes essence.

172
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Naturally, no ethical system has the answer on page 691, under “Your Mother 
or Your Country: Which to Choose?” Even if such a book existed, it would be 
up to you to decide whether to accept its conclusions. But really, any ethical 
system can give only vague rules that you have to interpret and apply. Sartre 
wants us to see that whether we acknowledge it or not, we’re always involv-
ing ourselves in our decisions. Whatever doctrine, advice, or other exter-
nal influence we may point to, in the end, we’re always the ones making a 
number of choices, whether it’s what action to take, which advice or doctrine 
to listen to, or how to interpret them. In this case, the student chose to go to 
Sartre for advice as opposed to someone else, and he got the advice he chose 
to get. Sartre’s response? “You are free. Choose.”
 
Coauthor Greg was a perfect illustration of this point himself. In college, he 
had a favorite professor he went to for advice. But in a sense, Greg knew per-
fectly well before he went what the advice would be. The bottom line from 
this professor was always the same: “Follow your heart.” On some level, Greg 
already knew what he wanted to do and what he wanted to hear by the time 
he went to the professor. Sartre thinks all decision-making is a more or less 
transparent version of this. That’s not to say nothing ever influences you. That 
influence is never determinative — that is, it’s never so strong as to force you 
to accept its direction and thereby eliminate your freedom to choose. You 
take all the available input and make a series of choices: weighing the informa-
tion, interpreting it, and finally deciding.
Freedom Is So Important 
Because It Brings Hope
 
Winston Churchill once said, “The pessimist sees difficulty in every opportu-
nity. The optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” Existentialism isn’t 
an easy philosophy; it doesn’t see the world as an easy place to live, and it 
doesn’t propose easy solutions to living in it. It is, however, a philosophy that 
sees an opportunity in the difficulties it examines. For Sartre, the greatest dif-
ficulty and the greatest opportunity in life both lie in human freedom.
Freedom means always having a choice, and where there’s a choice, there’s 
hope. This is the optimism Sartre’s philosophy offers — not that the world 
will be perfect, not that your choices will be easy, but that you’ll have a 
choice, and with that choice an opportunity to change yourself, your situa-
tion, and your world for the better. Sartre rejects all forms of fatalism, which 
suggest that our human nature dooms individuals or human beings as a 
group to be stuck in our situations.

173
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Cowardice was one of Sartre’s obsessions and an example he regularly 
returned to; after all, he did live in a time of war and fought for his freedom 
with the French Resistance. Many of the characters in his examples and his 
fiction are cowards who run from their responsibility or from standing up 
against totalitarianism and injustice. But the point Sartre continually comes 
back to is that the coward is a coward by choice. It isn’t any one decision 
that makes the coward a coward. A coward is someone who continually 
makes the decision to act in a certain way. But Sartre thinks this fact is the 
good news. If the coward is a coward by choice and is constantly faced with 
choices (which is the nature of life), the opportunity exists for the coward to 
change and choose to be courageous. No matter what your past, no matter 
what choices you’ve made, there’s always hope because you’re free. But this 
philosophy is a hard road, and that constant sense of possibility cuts both 
ways. The courageous hero is no more secure in her courageousness than 
the coward is in cowardice. Choice is a constantly recurring opportunity for 
both success and failure.
Free choice creates value and meaning
If God doesn’t exist, no eternal, objective measure of value exists, and noth-
ing has any inherent meaning. This doesn’t mean, however, that life has no 
meaning or value at all. It’s just that every meaning and value is a human 
meaning or a human value. And because human beings have no human 
nature and no inherent values or meaning, we’re constantly creating those 
human meanings and values.
Opening Pandora’s box
In the story of Pandora’s box, Pandora receives 
a box that the gods tell her not to open under 
any circumstances. Curiosity and the lure of the 
forbidden are too much for Pandora, and she 
eventually opens the box, which releases all the 
ills and troubles of the world. At the bottom of 
the box, however, is hope. As often interpreted, 
hope is the one consolation allowed to humans 
for the host of troubles facing them — the one 
consolation we have to help us through life.
In a sense, when existentialists announced the 
death of God, they opened a Pandora’s box, 
out of which flew the troubles of meaningless-
ness, anguish, and forlornness. But at bottom, 
what the existentialists offer is hope — hope 
that by opening the box and facing these hard-
ships that, after all, were sitting there waiting all 
along, we can find a way of coping with them. 
For Sartre in particular, the hope at the bottom 
of the box is freedom.

174
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
That creation happens when you make choices. Sartre is all about action. 
It’s all well and good to think that poetry, philosophy, opera, and art muse-
ums are the best things that life has to offer, but what does that mean if you 
choose to spend all your time watching Three’s Company? Your choices are 
the only expressions you have of what you value. On the other hand, if your 
choice wasn’t free, it wouldn’t be an expression of value. To value something 
means to view it as better in some way than an alternative. Without freedom, 
then, nothing would have value; where you placed your value would be deter-
mined for you. Because we appear to be the only creatures that express free 
choice, we’re the only creatures that can value one thing over another.
Choice, then, is a creative act. The meaninglessness and valueless-ness of the 
universe are, in a sense, only the starting points. We say in a sense because 
nothing creates absolute, eternal values. Those don’t exist. Through freedom, 
though, human beings have the power to escape the utter lack of values that’s 
our starting point in the universe. But this escape isn’t easy. It’s an act of will 
that people naturally shrink from. We want someone to provide a set answer — 
a fixed, eternal meaning — for us, and we don’t really want the responsibility 
that comes with creating values for ourselves.
Sartre’s response is sympathetic. He says he’s “vexed” by the lack of a God 
to provide eternal truths for us, but he points out that this is simply how it is. 
This is the situation we find ourselves in. Existentialism, as he sees it, doesn’t 
create that situation; it just creates an optimistic path through it.
How your choices affect you
As you choose, you create value. In doing so, you create yourself. For Sartre, 
freedom is the source of human dignity. Although it’s true that we start as 
nothing, we have the power to make something of ourselves and the freedom 
to determine what that will be. A rock or a watch can’t change what it is. This 
distinction is why Sartre rejects the notion that his philosophy debases human 
beings. He’s not a naturalist who equates human beings with animals or sees 
a human being as miniscule speck of dust before the grandeur of the universe. 
The universe is filled with objects that are conscious of nothing, feel nothing, 
choose nothing, and value nothing. The Milky Way, for all its vastness, is as 
dumb and senseless as a rock. Only human beings make choices and make 
themselves into something.
But you’re no more than what you choose. Sartre rejects the idea of human 
potential. He considers it meaningless to say that an author, for example, had 
another great book in her that she never wrote. The only measure of what 
a person is capable of is what she actually does. A human being is, after all, 
essentially nothing. All that exists at your center is an ability to choose.

175
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
Therefore, you’re no more than the sum of your actions. Because you’re con-
stantly choosing and acting, you’re constantly creating who and what you are. 
This power is why, instead of your choices and actions being meaningless (as 
you may expect from only a superficial understanding of existentialism), Sartre 
feels that your choices matter deeply.
This importance is why Sartre considers freedom to be the source of human dig-
nity. What makes us different from and more dignified than a rock or a watch is 
that what we are is in our hands. We have the freedom and the responsibility 
to create who and what we are. If you think about it, this corresponds with our 
everyday notion of responsibility. When someone holds you responsible, it is 
in one sense a burden, but it’s also a sign of respect. Holding someone respon-
sible indicates that the person is capable or competent. Children are in many 
instances considered incompetent. Adults don’t consider them capable of making 
decisions or choices. Although they may feel compassion for children, they don’t 
give them the respect they’d give a competent adult. For Sartre, existentialism 
isn’t an affront to human dignity — philosophical and religious systems that would 
deny human beings their responsibility are.
Choice and consequences
Although Sartre is optimistic about our ability to 
make choices and, consequently, our ability to 
make good choices and change, nothing in his 
philosophy extends this optimism to the realm 
of consequences. You can act heroically, but 
this heroism doesn’t guarantee any particular 
end result. Chance, facts about the world, and 
the freedom of others can all conspire to bring 
to ruin the effects of our noblest deeds.
But Sartre insists that, in some respects, these 
consequences don’t really matter. You’re free 
to make choices that create who you are. 
You can’t control the conditions in which you 
make those choices, and you can’t control the 
outcome. What you can control is sandwiched 
in between, on the one hand, the situation you 
find yourself in and, on the other hand, the 
effects your actions have on the world after you 
make your choices. If you make good choices, 
if you choose to live honestly and courageously, 
you’ve made of yourself an honest and coura-
geous person. That’s all you can do and all you 
can hope to do.
Sartre presents a great example of this princi-
ple in his short story The Wall. In it, protagonist 
Pablo Ibbieta has been arrested and sentenced 
to death. He repeatedly refuses to give up the 
location of resistance fighter Ramon Gris, even 
as his cellmates are taken out and shot one at 
a time. In a final act of defiance, he lies to the 
guards, saying that Gris is in a cemetery. Ibbieta 
is later confused that the guards allow him to 
continue living, until a recently captured man 
named Garcia tells him, “They got Gris.” How? 
Garcia tells him that Gris left his hiding spot and 
fled to the cemetery Ibbieta led his captors to. 
Ibbieta is overwhelmed by the absurdity, the 
tragedy, and even the comedy of the situation. 
Ibbieta’s situation isn’t unique. He couldn’t con-
trol whether the Fascists came to power, and 
he couldn’t control the outcome of his actions, 
which in this case were absurdly tragic. But in 
between, he chose to resist, he chose to act 
courageously, and so exercised his human 
dignity to make something of himself that he 
could call good.

How your choices affect the world
Every choice is an act of creation. Because Sartre doesn’t believe in God, eternal 
values, human nature, or an inherent meaning to human life, he’s committed to 
the idea that meaning, value, and your own character can arise only from your 
own choices. When you make a choice, you create in three ways:
 
 You create who you are. Each time you choose to tell the truth, for 
example, you contribute to the creation of someone who tells the truth.
 
 You create values. If you choose to tell the truth rather than lie, you 
have chosen to value truth. That value may have existed before you 
because others made a similar choice in the past, but it doesn’t exist 
apart from human choice. In that sense, your choice contributes to the 
creation of this value.
 
 You create what it means to be human. If human nature doesn’t exist, 
what human beings are and what it means to be human are simply an amal-
gamation of what individual human beings choose to make of themselves. 
In a very real way, then, when you make choices, you’re choosing what it 
means to be human. For Sartre, this fact was at the heart of the weight of 
responsibility that hangs over us.
Kant and the Categorical Imperative
Sartre’s philosophy, particularly as presented 
in “Existentialism,” owes much to the German 
philosopher and ethicist Immanuel Kant. 
Nowhere is this influence more evident than 
in Sartre’s assertion that when you choose for 
yourself, you’re choosing for the entire world. 
Kant wasn’t an existentialist. His philosophy 
was concerned with the search for universal 
ethical principles that he felt should guide all 
action, and such objective moral laws are pre-
cisely what the existentialists deny exist! Kant 
called the ethical principle he developed the 
Categorical Imperative. According to the first 
formulation of this principle (the two others 
aren’t important here), whenever you make a 
decision, you should act as though you’re cre-
ating a law for all human beings to follow. The 
question you should ask yourself is, “Can I will 
the principle behind this action to be treated as 
a universal law that everyone should follow?” 
Basically, should it be a rule that everyone act 
this way? Sartre takes a very different path but 
arrives at this same principle. For Kant, this 
imperative is an objective moral law, discov-
ered by rational inquiry. For Sartre, it arises 
simply from the nature of our situation. Because 
you are, in fact, choosing for all human beings, 
if you’re honest, you must acknowledge this 
fact and accept the responsibility that comes 
with your choices.

177
 Chapter 8: Sartre’s Existentialism: Learning to Cope with Freedom
We discuss the first point earlier. Sartre often speaks of the next two points 
together. The world of value and meaning is a human (and human-created) 
world. Because when you act, you’re helping create this world, Sartre feels 
that, in a sense, you aren’t making choices just for yourself, but for the whole 
world. When coauthor Chris makes a choice, he’s creating a value, and he’s 
defining what it means to be human. Sartre believes we have a great respon-
sibility to consider this fact as we make our choices. It’s natural, therefore, 
for you to ask of your choices, “Do I want this choice to be a human value, 
for all people?” “Is this what I believe human beings should be?” Sartre isn’t 
so much saying that you should ask these questions but that these questions 
will naturally arise in your decision-making process if you honestly look at 
the facts — namely, that in choosing, you’re creating values that extend 
beyond yourself. The questions themselves are simply a natural expression 
of the responsibility you have in creating values with your choices.
Freedom is the highest good
In one sense, Sartre, like the other existentialists, doesn’t believe in objective 
values. He argues in “Existentialism,” however, that you can identify one 
thing that logically must be considered not only valuable, but also the most 
valuable thing; in that sense, this thing is the highest good. Naturally, this 
thing is freedom. His argument is fairly straightforward. Because you give 
something value only when you freely choose it, all value comes from free 
choice. A rock or an ant may go left or right, but it doesn’t care which way 
it goes. It doesn’t choose the direction; the direction is chosen for it by a 
complex series of physical interactions. Without the ant’s active engagement 
in its own motion, it’s simply a mechanical process. Value arises when you 
express a preference for this over that through your freedom to choose this 
over that. Nothing is more valuable than freedom, then, because everything 
else that has value derives that value from freedom.
For Sartre, to value anything is to value the thing that gives it value. If you 
value courage, for example, you have to value free choice, because courage 
wouldn’t be valuable without it. To some extent, this argument is familiar. 
One of the traditional arguments for the greatness of God is that God is the 
source of all good things. If you love life and all the blessings of life, you 
should thank God and worship him as the source of all these good things. As 
the source, he’s higher and better than any one of those things. Without God, 
nothing has inherent value, not even life. 

178
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Similarly, by choosing life or anything else, human beings confer value upon 
life and the other things we choose. But what makes our choices value-cre-
ating, as opposed to the choices of, say, an aardvark, is that human beings 
have free choice. We make one choice rather than another, and so value one 
thing over another; we confer value upon this rather than that. So freedom 
is the highest good because it and it alone allows us to confer value upon 
various things in life. Without it, life wouldn’t just start without any inherent 
meaning or value; it would stay that way.

Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, 
Conscience, and Time
In This Chapter
 Understanding why facing death is essential to an authentic life
 Appreciating the importance of listening to your conscience
 Seeing why authenticity requires the right stance toward time
W
hen you think of existentialism, you probably get an image in your 
head of people sitting around muttering to themselves, dressed in 
black and depressed about their impending deaths. Well, some existentialists, 
such as Martin Heidegger, do think facing death is extremely important if 
you hope to live an authentic life that’s true to who and what you are. But it 
doesn’t mean going Goth and moping around all day being depressed.
Instead, as most existentialists suggest, living authentically means engaging 
with life in a way that honestly reflects what you are. This includes reflecting 
the ways that you’re limited as an existing being — and death is one of those 
limitations. In fact, as far as the existentialists see it, when you embrace death, 
you become liberated for the possibility of actually living. From this angle, 
it’s actually those who avoid the confrontation with death who end up living 
superficial lives that aren’t worth living. If you ask us, that’s what’s depressing — 
ignoring death!
Still, living authentically is no easy task. It’s especially hard if the existentialists 
are right that most of the time, you’re deeply immersed within the life of the 
crowd and the masses, far removed from confronting the important questions 
about life that you need to ask if you hope to live authentically. Luckily, for 
Heidegger, no matter how lost in the world you get, you’ll always have an exis-
tential conscience that calls upon you to shun the crowd and return to living in 
accord with who and what you are.

180
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In this chapter, we show how this conscience reveals even more ways, in 
addition to death, that our existence is limited. These limitations reveal more 
aspects about what you are that you have to embrace if you’re going to live 
authentically. This discussion of death and conscience leads to Heidegger’s 
claim that embracing your limitations — or living authentically as a whole, 
undivided self —involves having just the right stance toward your future, 
your past, and your present.
Specifically, authenticity requires living in a way that unifies your whole 
existence, bounded on one side by birth and on the other side by death, 
in the way that you engage with life in the moment through your actions. 
Authenticity is a way of giving your life wholeness across time.
Embracing Death as the Key to Life
Existentialists such as Heidegger think that a meaningful, authentic life 
requires an embrace of your own mortality. Given the importance of embrac-
ing death, we must ask, “How can you face it if you’ll never actually experi-
ence it?” After all, the moment death occurs, you no longer exist.
Well, Heidegger agrees that although you can’t know the actual event of your 
death, you can face up to the awareness that your end is an inevitable part of 
your future. This means recognizing that death is a possibility for you at each 
moment. Thus, authentic living is living toward death, actively embracing the 
fact that the Grim Reaper is always right up ahead.
 
 Facing up to death is something you can only do alone.
 
 Facing death individualizes you, separating you from the crowd and 
forcing you to take seriously the task of making meaningful, individual 
choices about how to live.
Given these points, avoiding death is what’s depressing, because it leads to a 
superficial, conformist life that’s not worth living at all.
Confronting death is essential
Generally, people think death is a depressing subject that should just 
be avoided. “Why focus on it? Just live!” they say. Heidegger disagrees. 
Confronting death is essential to living an authentic life. Still, some have 
argued that death can’t really play this central role because it’s entirely 
unknowable. After all, how can you face something you can’t even know?
The argument that you shouldn’t focus on death comes from an ancient 
school of philosophy called Epicureanism, which flourished around 300 BC. 

181
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
In a nutshell, the Epicureans thought that death was something that couldn’t 
ever really touch you at all. So they counseled that you should be, at best, 
indifferent to death.
Their reasoning is actually pretty simple, and something like the Epicurean 
argument is adapted by Jean-Paul Sartre. The argument suggests that death 
isn’t really a possibility for you because when death arrives, you are gone. 
As a result, death isn’t something that you can experience, because you and 
death can’t be in the same place at the same time. Because you can’t experi-
ence death, you have no reason to be concerned with it.
 
There’s something to this argument, isn’t there? If what you fear is the event 
of death, if you worry about what it’ll be like, the argument makes a good 
point: If you and death can’t be in the same place at the same time, it seems 
to make no sense to take up a position or an attitude toward it. Sure, you may 
worry about dying (you may say, “I hope I die in my sleep,” for example), but 
that’s a concern with the suffering that may go on just before you die, not a 
concern with death itself.
For Heidegger, however, it’s neither dying nor the actual event of death that 
he thinks you need to face up to. Instead, what’s central to living authenti-
cally is facing up to what the event implies: One day, you won’t be around.
If you think about it, it’s a curious fact that only human beings are capable of 
realizing this aspect of their finitude (the fact that they’ll one day end). Your 
plants and your pets will die, but they have no awareness of it. Dogs and cats 
may get sick and grow uncomfortable, but they have no idea how that sick-
ness may eventually play out. People do. As a result, Heidegger thinks that 
it’s an undeniable part of what you are: Being-toward-death is a possible way 
for you to be.
 
Facing up to your being-toward-death doesn’t mean sitting around worrying 
about death, brooding over it, or becoming morbid. It doesn’t mean going 
Goth and buying the standard existentialist gear (all black clothes). Instead, 
being-toward-death simply means never losing sight of your future finitude; it 
means letting that awareness affect the way you live your life.
Keeping an eye on the inevitable: 
The Grim Reaper is up ahead
Existentialists agree that humans are essentially forward-directed beings. 
Your existence involves always being one step ahead, planning, seeking out, 
and working through the possibilities that present themselves to you in any 
given situation. You’re always thinking, “What next?” But the Grim Reaper is 

182
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
up ahead, too, as one of those possibilities. As you push forward into life, you 
push forward into death. Each second is one in which death may occur.
We doubt anyone reading this right now is muttering to himself, “I’ll never 
die.” If you are, you may want to read Self-Deception For Dummies. We’ve got 
news for you: You most certainly will die. Unfortunately, Heidegger thinks, 
most people think of death inauthentically. They treat it as an event way off 
in the future, something distant from life itself. You may think, “Heck, I’m only 
20 (or 30, or 40, or 50 . . .). I still have X number of good years left in me, pro-
vided I don’t get hit by a bus!” This isn’t embracing death — it’s avoiding it.
 
Heidegger puts it this way: “Death is a possibility of being that Dasein always 
has to take upon itself. With death, Dasein stands before itself in its own most 
potentiality of being.”
Essentially, Heidegger wants you (collectively, we’re “Dasein”; see Chapter 6 for 
details) to see that you shouldn’t treat death as an event that’s coming closer 
to you with every passing moment, like a train slowly approaching from the dis-
tance. Thinking this way has the effect of putting distance between you and your 
death, making it something foreign and external to you and to what it means to 
live your life now, for you to exist. It’s inauthentic because:
 
 It makes death an external event instead of an internal way of being.
 
 It makes death a passive happening as opposed to an active way in 
which you can actually live.
Authentically embracing death doesn’t mean waiting for the event to occur; 
it means running toward it. Only by taking the bull by the horns and taking 
an active stance on death can you live a life that’s truly yours. Odd as it may 
sound, you have to learn to make death into a way to live.
 
Hold on a second. Heidegger isn’t advocating suicide. Running toward death 
doesn’t mean you’re seeking it out or trying to make it more likely in the near 
future. Instead, it means pushing into the future, or choosing among your 
possibilities while keeping in view the fact that one of those possibilities is 
always that you’ll die.
Living with death means thinking, “Hmm. I could do A or B. Or I could die.” 
You acknowledge that the possibility of your own impossibility, or the fact 
that one day your possibilities will end, is always present now; you live with 
it, so it’s not a distant, future event. If you can seriously do that, Heidegger 
thinks, death may well have a serious impact on the way you live.
Can you do that, honestly, and not in a halfhearted manner? Can you embrace 
your finitude? Really embrace the fact that Porky Pig could rip through the 
screen of your life now and say, “That’s all, folks!” Can you keep it up in a way 
that incorporates it into the way you live?

183
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
Making choices becomes monumental
in light of death
Few things are truer than this: When something is rare, it tends to be treated 
as valuable. When something is common, it tends to be viewed as cheap. Life 
is no exception. If you think that you have a lot of it to go around, you won’t 
value it as much. The less you think there is of it, the more you’ll take it seri-
ously. In short, death makes life valuable!
Anyone who has had a near-death experience can tell you that afterward, things 
just look different. Of course, in a way, everything around you is the same. But 
it all feels different; the way the world matters to you has changed. You become 
afraid of the danger of treading superficially in life. You desperately want your 
choices to matter.
When you have all the time in the world, life is frivolous
 
Recall those times when an awareness of the possibility of death wasn’t present to 
you. What happened? You treated the moments before you superficially. It hap-
pens all the time. Have you ever been in the midst of some project that you 
think you have to do while promising yourself that when you’re done, you’ll 
get back to that other project — the one you think is more important and that 
you’ve been neglecting? Maybe it’s your work; it gets in the way of your spending 
time with your family. Maybe it’s something else, but the story is always the 
same: You always have time later. This is the essence of treating life 
superficially.
Understanding how this happens is easy. Think of the future moments of 
your life as something you want. You have a demand for life. Now consider 
the law of supply and demand to see how much those moments of life are 
worth to you. When you treat death as an event that’s far off and distant from 
you, you’re clearly reasoning that that you have a decent amount of supply 
(of life) lying around. You’re convinced that even if you’re going to die, it 
won’t be today or tomorrow or even next week! You see supply as high, so 
the value of life winds up being low. That’s why the important stuff gets put 
off. You think you have plenty of time get back to it. You live frivolously.
The inevitability of death invigorates life
 
Now imagine something different. Say that you thought you had half that time 
left to live. Or a quarter of it. Or perhaps that you had two weeks to live. Would 
your way of interacting with life change? It should! The reason is obvious: 
The demand for life remains constant, but the supply of life just got drastically 
smaller! As a result, the value of life goes up in response. Choice starts to 
matter.

184
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
The moral of the story is clear: When you live with death, as part of the 
very way in which you approach life, you take your life more seriously. The 
embrace of death invigorates life. You invest each moment with seriousness. 
You ask real questions about why you should live in this way as opposed to 
that way. Each moment matters. After all, you realize that you aren’t going to 
get a mulligan or a do-over at any point. When you make choices in life, it’s 
like the sign in the store window: “All sales are final.”
Death increases life’s value
Perhaps you’re thinking, “Maybe death is part of life, but wouldn’t it be better 
if it weren’t?” If the supply-and-demand theory of life is accurate, the answer 
is no. The supply of life would go up, infinitely! But if that’s right, the value of 
life drops infinitely as well! As a consequence, immortality doesn’t sound par-
ticularly attractive. Sure, you’d have an infinite amount of time to experience 
things. But you wouldn’t value the moments. You’d forever put things off. 
Why not? You could always do the important stuff later. The immortal would 
live with no zest. No passion. Not for us, thanks! We’ll choose death!
Time and death on the jukebox
Artists probably think about death more than 
most folks. One music band that seems to revel 
in the desire to grapple with death authenti-
cally is Pink Floyd. The recognition that we can 
often become aimless and without direction as 
a result of failing to take our finitude seriously is 
captured nicely in the appropriately titled song 
“Time.” A partial listing of the lyrics reads
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull 
day,
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand 
way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your 
home town,
Waiting for someone or something to show you 
the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to 
watch the rain,
You are young and life is long and there is time 
to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got 
behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the 
starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the 
sun, but it’s sinking
And racing around to come up behind you 
again.
The sun is the same in the relative way, but 
you’re older.
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
The song perfectly gets at the point Heidegger 
advances: When you fail to acknowledge death, 
you become frivolous, spending the moments 
you have without purpose. When you think 
that you have time to “kill,” it means you aren’t 
coming face to face with your death. And that 
means that your life ends up wasted. You “fritter 
and waste the hours in an offhand way.”

185
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
After you look at things in this way, you start to see that the possibility of 
living with death — or acknowledging your finitude — is a gift. It gives you 
the possibility of taking your life seriously. Without it, meaningful life would 
be impossible. Of course, that doesn’t mean that everyone uses the gift 
he’s been given. Most people, sadly, live their lives as though they’re really 
immortal.
Meeting death alone: It’s inevitable
Facing death leads to an inevitable confrontation with anxiety (check out 
Chapter 4 to read more about anxiety). Not surprisingly, death anxiety has a 
useful function within existentialism. It causes you to recognize that you’re 
individual. After you become aware of this fact, you sense that the ways that 
society and “They,” or the others, live life doesn’t speak to you as a unique 
individual. As a result, death anxiety makes responding to death by hiding 
within a life dominated by what “They” do difficult. That means that facing 
death involves re-questioning how to live, doing it alone.
Living resolutely
Facing up to the reality of your finitude and death has a very jarring effect on 
a person. It tends to make you think of the individual choices in your life as 
serious and monumental; you no longer want to approach life in a superficial 
way. Essentially, death instills in you a desire to be resolute. You want to 
approach the question of how to live with determination and force.
But how do you actually carry that out? What should you resolutely do? The 
anxiety that facing death brings doesn’t tell you. It simply forces you to 
realize that it’s your life to live and your death that you need to face up to. 
Of course, “They” have ways that they’d like you to deal with death (which 
means to avoid it!). And “They” have ways that they’d like you to live. But in 
anxiety, “They” don’t appeal to you; “They” have no persuasive force, and 
you can’t get over the fact that “They” are artificial.
Making choices on your own terms
To face death authentically — to live your life — means to face the challenge 
of your finitude on your own terms. Yep. Apart from “Them” and apart from 
their schemes, their distractions, and their ways of trying to get you to avoid 
the subject of finitude. This can be a bit scary. For the first time, you feel radi-
cally alone. The choice of how to live is only yours.
But it’s also scary for another reason: When you distance yourself from “Them,” 
you also remove the possibility of making any choice that you’re assured is 
certainly the right one. That’s what “They” offer. “They” provide the security of 
obvious choices because what you must and should do in the eyes of the public 
is clear. Individual life, on the other hand, is risky. It’s not safe.

186
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Heidegger’s message here is simple: Dealing with death by finding an indi-
vidual path to resolutely follow can’t be farmed out or outsourced to the 
“They” or to others. Embracing the eventual ending of your own existence, 
expressed through your way of making resolute choices, is something that 
you have to deal with as an individual, without any assurances that you’re 
living your life in the right way.
 
Confronting death means feeling vulnerable and threatened in the face of life. 
When you confront death, you have nowhere to run. But that’s what living 
authentically means. To live freely. To feel truly alive. You ready for that?
Conscience Nags You to Be Yourself
Existentialism puts a high premium on highlighting the possibility of living 
authentically. Recognition of death is integral to understanding and grappling 
with the finitude of your future. But surely you don’t need to have a near-death 
experience to have the kinds of insights required to be authentic, do you?
Heidegger’s reply is that everyone comes equipped with an existential con-
science that calls to them to live authentically. This conscience turns out to 
be you talking to yourself about yourself. Conscience is you trying to shake 
the part of you lost in the crowd out of its stupor and conformity. When you 
heed the call of your conscience, you take a necessary step toward embrac-
ing yourself and living authentically.
According to Heidegger, conscience shakes you from the inauthentic life of 
the crowd by reminding you of your guilt, which in turn points out to you your 
responsibility for taking ownership of what you are as a self or as a being.
Specifically, your existential conscience nags you to own up to the fact that 
part of what you are is a “lack” or “nullity.” What this means is that your 
conscience wants you to own up to the fact that as an existing, choosing, self-
determining being, you’re incomplete in some key ways, such as the 
following:
 
 The possibilities available to you for self-definition aren’t limitless; in 
fact, the options you have are structured by the historical and cultural 
world you’re born into.
 
 You can’t make all the possibilities available to you a reality.
Essentially, your history gives you a context in which your task of self-definition 
must be carried out; in addition, when you make choices, you’re forced to 
further limit your possibilities by always ruling out other paths for yourself 
forever.

187
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
The voice of conscience is always there
Highlighting the possibility of living an authentic life is clearly important to 
existentialists. However, they also recognize that people are often deeply 
wrapped up in inauthentic living. So this raises a problem: If you’re often 
lost in your routines, how can authenticity be an ever-present, live option for 
you? What wakes you up? Heidegger says it’s the presence of your (existen-
tial) conscience. It calls you to be authentic, but listening to it is up to you.
 
Heidegger thinks this existential conscience has a clear function. As he puts it, 
“Conscience summons Dasein’s Self from its lost-ness in the They.” It’s inside 
you, like a built-in voice always in operation, one that calls you to find your 
way out of your zombielike, inauthentic routine.
You’ve likely heard the voice of your existential conscience. It nudges you 
to realize that you transcend the crowd and the routines you get lost in. It 
makes you feel uncomfortable in those routines when you get a bit too com-
fortable in them, pushing you to feel fake and untrue to yourself. It nags you 
with an awareness that you aren’t living up to your true potential. This voice 
isn’t comforting because it disrupts the secure, but artificial, tranquility you 
find in the inauthenticity of crowd life. As a result, Heidegger thinks that con-
science always feels like an imposition, as if it comes against your will. No 
doubt — it pierces through that artificial bliss you’re enjoying in the “They”!
In a way, your existential conscience is like your moral conscience, which also 
is like a voice. Your moral conscience, however, tells you that some actions 
are wrong, whereas your existential conscience isn’t concerned with what you 
do at all. Instead, it focuses on how you go about living. Moreover, your moral 
conscience and your existential conscience don’t need to agree (we outline 
Kierkegaard’s claim that such a disagreement occurs in the case of Abraham 
in Chapter 10). After all, according to the existentialist, your moral conscience 
may be nothing more than the internalized voice of the crowd, a feeling of 
shame that warns you that you’re not doing “what one does.”
 
Your existential conscience reminds you that no matter what path you choose 
to take in life, the possibility exists for you to take that path authentically or 
inauthentically. You can choose it because that’s what “one” does, or you can 
choose it as an expression of your unique individuality. It’s up to you.
Conscience: You talking to you about you
Where does this mysterious existential conscience come from? Who’s speak-
ing? Who specifically is being spoken to? How does the conscience get its 
message across? Oddly enough, Heidegger thinks that all these questions are 

188
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
answered in the same way — in a word, “you.” You’re the caller. You’re being 
called, and the message is to point out you to you! Existential conscience is 
you holding up a mirror to you so you can see your true nature.
 
Think of the call of conscience like a phone call. On one end you have the 
person dialing (the caller). That’s you. But it’s the you who’s always in there, 
in your life, always capable of authenticity (no matter what you do, unless you 
magically turn into a stone or an animal, this part of yourself is always present). 
That self always capable of authenticity is the caller. We call it the “You-Self.”
 
The You-Self is dialing up the you who is presently lost in the crowd. It must: 
Heidegger says the call can’t be addressed to the They-Self. The They-Self is 
the self of the everyday — the self within you that represents the voice of the 
crowd. The They-Self is the everyone-self that has no identity of its own, the 
identity you take on when you become steeped in your conformist routines. 
The They-Self actually avoids the call. In fact, as Heidegger puts it, in the call 
of conscience the They-Self “gets passed over in this appeal.” When Heidegger 
says that the call of conscience passes over the They-Self, the implication 
is that in passing over the They-Self, the call dislodges the You-Self that’s 
trapped within the They-Self. In dislodging it, the call allows the You-Self to 
see itself as something separate from “Them.”
But how does it work? If you had an FBI transcript of the call, what would be 
on it? Well, nothing actually; it wouldn’t say anything in words. This makes 
sense, because the call doesn’t address you as a father or as a worker or as 
any of the designations the “They” offers you to understand yourself. Instead, 
conscience wants to communicate to you as an individual — to the you 
behind those roles. Thus, the call operates in silence in refusing to address 
the They-Self and forcing you to recognize that you’re different, that you’re 
capable of more.
 
In a way, the call is like the You-Self (as possible authenticity) yelling to itself 
(the You-Self actually trapped in the crowd or the “They”): “Hey! Buddy! 
Remember me?” In the call of conscience, the You-Self is desperately trying to free 
itself from its own entanglements in the world, in inauthentic life in the “They.”
Face it: You’re guilty!
Your existential conscience doesn’t instruct you to take on any specific paths 
in the world. It doesn’t tell you, “Hey, be a doctor” or “Look, don’t steal from 
others.” Instead, in calling you to be yourself, the existential conscience 
wants you to face up to what you are apart from the crowd. At the core of 
this effort, it wants you to see that you’re guilty. But guilty of what?

189
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
Moral guilt versus existential guilt
Typical intuitions of what it means to have a conscience are associated 
pretty closely with notions of guilt. People say things like “Oh, my conscience 
wouldn’t let me do that,” meaning that it invoked feelings of guilt, preventing 
them from following through with the action. In such cases, you’re dealing 
with your moral conscience and with moral guilt.
Existential conscience calls you to recognize your guilt — not moral guilt, but 
existential guilt. Here’s the difference:
 
 Moral guilt: Moral guilt typically acts as a spotlight of sorts. It’s a result 
of performing some shameful action, and it points to an absence of some-
thing in you. When you steal, moral guilt pains you because it makes 
apparent your lack of honesty. Moral guilt makes clear to you that you’re 
incomplete or limited in some important way.
 
 Existential guilt: In contrast, existential guilt doesn’t point to an action, 
but to you as a being. Moral guilt points to a lack in you that causes that 
action, whereas existential guilt points to an absence that’s a fundamen-
tal essential part of what you are as an existing being. The lacks that 
moral guilt point to should be filled in; the lacks that existential guilt 
points to should be embraced.
Heidegger calls these lacks or limitations that are central to what you are 
nullities. Existential guilt brings you face to face with the fact that you’re fun-
damentally incomplete. Moral guilt can spotlight lacks that can be filled in 
(by becoming honest, for example), but your existential nullity is an essential 
aspect of you. It can’t be removed. As a result, you’re always guilty.
Existential guilt calls you to take responsibility
If you’re always guilty, what’s existential guilt calling on you to do? Guilt typi-
cally calls upon people to take responsibility. In the case of moral guilt, it 
calls upon you to take responsibility for your lacks by owning up to them and 
then taking the appropriate steps to fill them in.
Existential guilt also demands that you take responsibility for your nullities, 
but in a very different way. Because you can’t fill in those nullities, taking 
responsibility for them means owning up to them as you. In other words, 
taking responsibility means living in a way that honestly strives to express 
the nullities in the way that you live your life. It means embracing your guilt.
Chin up! Face your limitations!
The existential conscience calls you to face up to what you are. This means 
recognizing and embracing the ways in which your existence as a choosing, 

190
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
self-defining being — a being who puts possibilities for itself in play — is 
limited. One of those limitations points to the fact that you don’t control how 
you come to have the possibilities to define yourself. The other points to the 
reality that you can’t be all your own possibilities. Instead, choosing some-
thing always negates and narrows down what’s possible for you to choose 
later on.
You’re a chooser, and choosing means destroying
Before turning to how you’re limited, we give a basic definition of what you 
are. Existentialism embraces the idea that you’re a choosing, self-determining 
being. You’re special in that your existence is always at issue for you, so existing 
always means being in the process of defining yourself through the choices you 
make. With that in mind, how can this kind of being have limitations?
As a self-chooser, you’re always faced in a situation with a set of options 
to choose among. We call them A, B, and C. Your first limitation or nullity 
emerges right here: Although these are all your possibilities from which to 
define your life, you can’t embrace them all. You must forge forward and 
choose. You have no escape. When you choose A, you must choose not to 
fulfill choices B and C. So being a chooser means electing one possibility and 
destroying (or nullifying) the remaining ones. Just as death limits your possi-
bilities for self-definition going forward (because your possibilities will end!), 
actual choice involves the destruction of the possibilities that exist now. 
After an option is gone, it’s lost forever.
 
Recognizing this element of your finitude, or this sense in which your exis-
tence as a chooser of possibility contains a nullity, can be frightening. You 
see all the possible selves laid out for you to be, but you can’t be them all. 
Sometimes you may try to escape this. You may try to have it both ways by 
desperately trying to figure out a way to actualize everything at once. Or you 
may try postponing the need to decide. Either way, you’re trying to escape 
from one of the fundamental aspects of what you are as a self-defining being. 
Forging into possibility involves destroying possibility. No two ways about it. 
To create, you must destroy!
Don’t expect any assurances
The fact that choosing kills some of your possibilities forever leaves you 
wanting assurance that you’ve done the right thing. Well, you can’t ever get 
that kind of assurance; this is revealed by the second nullity at your core as a 
self-defining being.
To be completely assured that your choice is right, you need to be able to 
step outside any context that may influence your way of looking at things. What 
you want is a timeless, God’s-eye view of your situation. From this standpoint, 
you could objectively and dispassionately sort through the possible options and 

191
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
figure out which option is right. Heidegger’s point, however, is that when you 
truly see what you are, you see that this will never happen. You can never 
step outside your biased framework to see with assurance what’s right.
Heidegger’s point here is that as a self-defining being, you have to make choices 
within an historical and cultural framework — one that structures not only 
what’s possible for you, but also how you think about those possibilities. What’s 
possible for you, in a given situation, is different from what was possible for an 
ancient Roman. You don’t share the same world or the same history. Moreover, 
ancient Romans saw and experienced the world differently than you. You inevi-
tably respond differently even to the same situations.
 
Heidegger calls this being thrown. Being a self-defining being requires being 
thrown into a certain historical situation, a certain time period, a certain cul-
ture, and a context that makes a specific set of lives possible. Heidegger thinks 
that although this does function as a constraint, because your power of self-
definition is indeed limited, it isn’t something to complain about. Instead, it’s 
the very ground of your freedom! To want to create yourself from the ground 
up should be seen as inauthentic — essentially obscuring and refusing to face 
up to the fact that your human existence is a situational one. All lives have a 
context in which they should be understood.
The Importance of Living in Time
Heidegger thinks authenticity demands embracing your existential nature, 
which means acknowledging the finitude or set of limitations specific to you 
as a self-choosing, self-determining being. As he sees it, living authentically 
requires that you have the right orientation toward the past and toward the 
future. After all, death lies in the future, your historical context lies in your 
past, and you must make choices in the present.
To investigate this idea, however, we first need to think about what it would 
mean to be oriented toward time. We look briefly at two different ways in 
which you can understand time:
 
 What we call everyday time treats time as something that’s outside you, 
external to your life and to your experiences. Everyday time sees the 
past, present, and future as separate and disconnected, like a series of 
independent moments.
 
 The existential view sees life itself as immersed within time and also 
holds that the experience of the past, present, and future aren’t separate, 
but intimately interrelated.

192
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Because authenticity requires that you be oriented toward time in living, you 
need to discard the everyday notion, which sees time as external to living. In 
fact, for experiences within life to be truly meaningful, they need to be experi-
enced across time — something only the existential notion of time can explain.
The everyday view: You’re in time
According to the everyday view, time is something external to you, a kind of 
medium that you travel through. This everyday standpoint on time also sees 
the past, present, and future as disconnected and also sees only the present 
as having any real significance.
In the everyday sense, time is captured when you think of the clock. As the 
hands move, you think, “Wow . . . that thing is measuring time.” But what is 
this clock time? What’s being measured? Hard to put your finger on it, isn’t 
it? The following three points seem to be true of the human way of thinking 
about everyday time:
 
A. Time is external to you.
 
B. Time is a series of identical, disconnected, “now” moments.
 
C. In time, only the present exists, so it’s the most important.
In the following sections, we think these points through.
Time is external to you
Start with (A). Do you typically think of time as something that you’re in, 
like water can be in a cup or like a medium that you can move through? It’s 
like space, in a way. Just as you may say, “That pen is 2 feet from that lamp,” 
you think, “The American Revolution is more than 200 years away from 
me.” Events far off are distant from you because they’re farther away in the 
medium of time than others are. This way of talking leads you to think that 
you’re in something temporal right now, and other events are in other tem-
poral spots so that you can measure the distance between them (in terms of 
minutes or hours or years).
Time is a series of identical, disconnected, “now” moments
You’d probably say that you’re “in a moment” — the now. Wait. Now you’re 
in a different now, and you’ve left the former now behind! And again! Sit still, 
won’t you? Here’s where point (B) comes into play, which suggests that you 
jump from one identical “now” moment to the next, leaving behind past “now” 
moments and looking forward to new “now” moments yet to come. From this 
view, all time is really the same, because all the moments are just identical 
“now” containers that stuff can be put into. But if you think about it, it also 

193
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
suggests that the past, present, and future are disconnected. The present is 
here, whereas the past (or future), is over there, in the (temporal) distance.
In time, only the present exists, so it’s the most important
From here, point (C) becomes clear. When you’re in a “now” moment, you 
exist in the present. But you can’t, according to this view, be in a “now” 
moment in the past or in the future. Then you’d be in two different spots at 
once! Maybe you were, and maybe you will (ideally!). But according to the 
everyday view of time, the past “now” moments are gone and buried. And the 
future ones don’t yet exist. Only the present, then, can really exist and have 
any real significance.
 
If you think about it, everyday talk about time is helpful in many ways. You 
do need to coordinate appointments, so using the clock is valuable. But clock 
time doesn’t seem to have much to do with how you experience life, other 
than dating certain things that happen to you in life. The existentialists, how-
ever, don’t want to say that living or existing comes first and then is placed in 
time. Instead, they want to say that living itself is temporal. As a result, it’s not 
surprising that they have a different conception of time!
The existential view: Lived time
Existentialism approaches existence from a personal perspective, from the 
first-person point of view, so we’re interested in the role that time plays in 
understanding life from the inside. What’s it like for time to be part of you? 
Existentialists such as Heidegger stress that human life requires a way of 
existing that’s spread across time.
You can’t separate life from time
 
Heidegger’s view of lived time is different from the everyday time measured by 
the clocks on the wall. To start, in opposition to the everyday conception of 
time, Heidegger doesn’t think that time is external to you. It’s not some feature 
of the world, and it’s not something that your life can be in. Heidegger says 
that life and time can’t be pulled apart in a way that would allow one (life) to 
be in the other (time). Time plays too intimate a role in what it means to live 
for that to ever be possible. Life is temporal at the core.
The past and future are meaningful
Think of the way in which you experience life. Are you jumping from one 
“now” to the next, as the everyday conception of time suggests? Not very 
likely! Instead, life seems to have a kind of meaningful flow, as if within life 
as you experience it, the boundaries between the past, the present, and the 
future aren’t as sharp as the everyday conception suggests.

194
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Say that at the moment (right now), you’re getting your passport photo taken. 
How is it possible that this action turns out to be meaningful to you in the way 
that actions in life can be? From the existential perspective, the meaning of 
that action relies on the experience of the present including an experience of 
the past and the future at the same time. If that’s right, the existential past isn’t 
dead, and the existential future isn’t yet to happen. Rather, they’re both pres-
ent in your experience with life right now.
 
Think about the example a bit. Getting your passport photo taken is signifi-
cant to you because later you’ll be in Greece, a possibility you’re pushing into 
and experiencing. So the action is connected to the way that you’re projected 
forward into future possibilities. In Heidegger’s view, this means that in your 
experience, you’re always outside the present, already reaching forward into 
the future.
At the same time, your action is meaningful because “ancient Greek philoso-
phy has always appealed to you.” Your past likes and dislikes, your upbring-
ing, and your history aren’t dead events in the past. Instead, they shape you 
and the way you experience your world and the possibilities of your worldly 
situation. These are elements of what you are that set the stage for actions 
that you perform to be meaningful. Actions tend to be meaningful when they 
play a role in a story, one that has a past, a present, and a future.
Take this point further. If it’s true that the self can be meaningful and sig-
nificant, a meaningful (authentic) life will live in a way that stresses its past 
and future. Human life, or your existence itself, is temporal. It would make 
no sense to say that you exist and then you’re located in time! A meaningful 
human life is connected across time.
Pulling Yourself Together through Time
Heidegger opposes the everyday view of time because it views time as 
external to your life and because it views time as a series of unrelated now 
moments. Neither seems true, however, of the way that you experience life 
temporally. Lived, existential time seems very different; time is central to 
your way of existing, one in which moments in the past, present, and future 
are related to one another in the way you experience life as meaningful. 
Existing for you means living across time.
With this notion of existential time as your guide, when is your life meaning-
ful, whole, or authentic? What’s the right approach toward time? Heidegger’s 
answer is that your life is authentic when, in the way that you engage in 
certain actions, you embrace your entire future and past. One way to see it 
is to note that the self has a dimension not only on the present, but also on 
the past and future. Because authenticity means being yourself, your way of 

195
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
existing must strive to live all your past and future specific to you as a self, in 
your present acts. Only in living this way can you hope to succeed in pulling 
together your whole self and achieve authenticity.
In this section, we investigate what it means to embrace and unify your 
future, past, and present. We show that unifying yourself across time con-
nects to our earlier point that authenticity for Heidegger requires embracing 
the finitude specific to you as an existing being. Along the way, we also view 
the inauthentic ways of living across time as ways to reject our various finite 
limitations. As you may expect, failing to unify the self by rejecting either the 
future or the past (or both) aspects of what you are, or rejecting your own 
finitude, results in the type of life specific to being lost in the crowd.
You always exist in the future . . .
Although the everyday conception of time sees the present as the most 
significant part of time, Heidegger thinks the future has clear priority when 
understanding who you are as a being. Fundamentally, people are self-
defining beings always focused ahead on what’s possible for them; in 
Heidegger’s jargon, you’re a “being-ahead-of-itself.” Given this fact, you can 
live authentically or inauthentically toward your future.
 
Pay attention to the way you’re existing right now. Are you just in the 
moment? Or are you always looking ahead into the future, trying to see where 
to go next? You’re always reaching ahead of yourself into the next moment. 
It’s a good thing, too. If part of your way of actually existing weren’t one step 
in the future, you couldn’t be a self-defining being always striving to address 
the question “Who am I?” After all, asking such questions involves looking for-
ward to possible ways of addressing the question.
Heidegger thinks that the possibility of living in an inauthentic or authentic 
way is always before you. If self-definition of forward-directedness is essential 
to you, you should expect that there will be inauthentic and authentic ways 
of doing it.
The inauthentic future
For Heidegger, the inauthentic future is precipitated by the refusal to embrace 
death. That means you refuse to live in a way that recognizes that being pro-
jected forward into new possibilities should be accomplished in light of the 
fact that your efforts might, in the next second, end. Of course, living inauthenti-
cally in the future still means being focused toward possibilities and choosing 
(you can’t help doing that). But in refusing to face up to your death, you reject 
your own finitude, and as a result, you refuse to face up to a part of your own self 
as a self-defining being. You can’t live in a whole way when you do that because 
you disown a large and essential part of yourself.

196
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
As far as Heidegger sees it, when you flee from this anxiety-laded recognition, 
you run straight into the tranquilizing arms of the “They” or the crowd. In 
the midst of the “They,” you don’t need to deal with these issues. You don’t 
need to tackle with the urgency of self-definition in the face of your inevitable 
end. Instead, you can focus on measuring up in the eyes of the public at large. 
You forfeit the kind of individuality that emerges from a courageous facing up 
to death, but in exchange you get the snuggly, warm, and fuzzy kind of bliss 
that’s associated with crowd-based, robotic conformity.
How does this happen? Perhaps you focus on the possibilities that relate 
to keeping up with the Joneses. Perhaps you focus on redecorating your 
house, hosting parties, and making sure that you’re always running with the 
right people. In a way, insecurity (anxiety) about your finite future (death) 
is replaced by a different sort of worldly insecurity: fear about succeeding in 
the mass-generated, public world of success that you’ve embraced.
 
Heidegger calls the inauthentic mode of being toward the future awaiting. He 
uses a passive term for good reason, because those who await see their own 
possibilities only in terms of the successes or possible failures of their worldly 
projects. When you await, your way of thinking about the task of self-creation 
is dominated by the question “What should one do now?”
The authentic future
Authentic being-toward-the-future is very different. Heidegger calls it antici-
pation. Where awaiting is passive, anticipation is active — a way of running 
toward your future. This involves a recognition that you will die.
This recognition tears you away from the “They” and from complacent 
modes of living. You see the possibilities for existing in the future as far 
exceeding the possibilities that are offered up and dictated by “Them.” As 
a result, you see the future in terms of the always unsettled question “What 
should I do now?” — a question that necessarily requires your involvement 
in the answer. You no longer wait but drive forward in an active sense, reso-
lute to forge courageously toward your death by living as an individual in 
light of the projects you commit to. Although your future possibilities are 
fixed in the inauthentic future, in the authentic future they’re open, and you 
take an active role in determining what they are.
. . . And you always exist in the past
Although your primary mode of existence is toward the future, Heidegger 
reminds you that your existence always has a distinctly embedded location. 
As he puts it, you’re “already-being-in-a-world.” This means that you push 
forward into the future from somewhere. In a sense, your attempt at resolute 
self-definition always has a starting point, one that Heidegger sees as your 
historical and cultural heritage. Whether you embrace your heritage (and 

197
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
your finitude) as a part of your way of existing, though, is up to you. You 
could also choose to try to forget it or to dismiss its importance in your life.
Think of the angry child who cries out, “I didn’t ask to be born!” In actuality, 
the child is verbalizing a profound truth that applies to everyone. Not only 
didn’t you ask to be born, but you also didn’t ask to be born here, in this 
time, or in this culture. And that means that the way in which you understand 
your continual task of self-definition is heavily dependent upon the way that 
possibilities are made available to you (and the way that they’re framed and 
understood) in that context. This fact, if you recall, is one of the types of fini-
tude that your conscience reveals to you, if you listen to it.
 
This fact fits easily into Heidegger’s way of thinking about your existence as 
temporal. If being authentic means thinking about your future as aiming toward 
your eventual death, it also means thinking about your past as pointing toward 
your historical and cultural birth. Quite literally, it’s a recognition of what you, 
as a self, emerge out of. The 19th century gave birth (say) to one way of engag-
ing with the project of self-definition; Rome in the fourth century gave birth to 
a very different way of being a self; and your own time and culture gave birth 
to yet another. As a result, your way of engaging the question “Who am I?” is 
always tied to that context. As a result, that past is alive in you right now — in 
the way that you exist, in the way that you approach the future.
But how does this fit into the notion of having to embrace your finitude if you 
want to live authentically? Just as much as death functions as a limitation 
on you as a self-defining chooser (your possibilities will end, after all!), your 
birth does too. The limitation is clear; not everything is possible for you. 
Much as you may want to be the supreme master of who you are, it’s just not 
possible (Kierkegaard called this desire demonic) because you can never get 
your past under your control in that kind of way. Even thinking about your 
past is influenced by your past. Try as you might, you can never self-define 
the very conditions that make your attempts at self-definition possible.
Forgetting: The inauthentic mode of the past
Heidegger’s name for facing your past inauthentically is called forgetting, 
which is appropriate, because it seeks to obscure your existential relation-
ship as a chooser to your past. In the inauthentic past, you refuse to recog-
nize the connection between how you push forward into the future and your 
historical and cultural birth. When you forget, you disown a part of yourself, 
and as a result, living as a whole self is impossible.
 
When thinking about forgetting, remember that inauthentic views of time view 
time as a sequence of disconnected moments, and that the present is always 
central. From this view, the past is what’s dead and “no longer.” Seeing the 
past in this way separates the past from any kind of actual interaction with 
what’s meaningful in the present. In a sense, the past is nothing more than a 
museum of archived events on display.

198
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Inauthenticity is always a flight away from the task of individual self-definition, 
a headlong rush into the lifestyles prescribed by the crowd — by the “They.” 
How does this translate into the inauthentic way of living with the past? Well, it 
means living toward the past the way “They” demand.
 
How are the projects and roles and rules prescribed by “Them” presented to 
you? Does the crowd see its own fads and wisdom as following from a limited 
set of possibilities that history had laid out? Do people in the crowd think, 
“If we’d been in a different context, we’d have different wisdom!” “No!” says 
the “They.” They see what “one does” as universally valid. As timeless. If their 
truths are connected to history at all, it’s as the culmination of history’s trials 
and errors. If so, what’s the point of the past, other than to view it as a sort of 
amusing curiosity?
Repetition: The authentic mode of the past
Engaging with your past authentically is very different. You don’t see your 
past as dead — as a set of moments you’re forever separated from. Instead, 
the past is open and alive in you now. The past is in you, giving significance 
to the present (and the future) and shaping the possibilities for you to define 
who you are and who you will be.
As a result, to authentically engage the part of your self that’s “past” requires 
refusing to see the significance of what’s possible for you now as self-
contained within the wisdom of the “They” and their so-called timeless fads 
and wisdom. This preset menu of choices that “one follows” isn’t the way of 
living, but one way of living.
Authentic engagement with the past also recognizes that “They” do 
their best to obscure the fact that history and culture make available to 
you a whole host of different ways to live, examine, and understand your life. 
When “They” focus on history, it’s selective. “They” remember what supports 
their fads and trends, and forget (or bury) the rest. It’s in their best interest to 
hide the different possibilities for self-definition that culture and history make 
available because failing to do so would highlight that their way is merely one 
of many. So the authentic view of the past reveals that your existence is in an 
inevitable tension with the “They.” To be authentic, you must do battle, using 
the past as a way of re-understanding the present in a way that allows for a 
criticism of their way of presenting the world, and your role, to you.
For Heidegger, this means that you need to reveal what’s been hidden or 
obscured in your heritage (which is you, after all!). You must claim your heritage 
as your own and employ it to create unique possibilities for individually facing 
up to your present life in a way that avoids “Them” and their way of understand-
ing what is possible. Authentically engaging with the past thus opens possibili-
ties and allows for individuality. After all, your past is you, so you need to learn 
to dig in and figure out a way to own it, highlight it, and live it in the present.

199
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
First, as a self-defining chooser, you need to embrace that your options are 
limited to the ones made possible by your contextual birth (your heritage). 
Don’t see this as an unjust limitation on you. After all, it is you! It’s your 
unique birth that makes being an individual possible. To embrace this, you 
need to reach back into yourself (in your own history) to discover what was 
obscured by “Them” as options for you to understand and grapple with your 
life and your future. Heidegger calls this method of authentically engaging the 
past — by using it as a way to try to understand the present — repetition.
 
When Heidegger tells you to engage in repetition, he isn’t telling you to dress 
and talk and act like people from the past. You don’t want to literally repeat 
the past and walk around with a bizarre wig on your head, acting like you’re 
George Washington. Instead, you want to look back in the past and observe 
how people lived their lives — how they thought and how they approached 
things. What possibilities were open to those people to face life? All these vari-
ous ways of existing present possibilities that are part of your heritage, and 
they’re available for you to take up as an individual. You can then adapt these 
options to the present circumstances of your own life or the question of how 
to forge ahead into your future.
 
Given the fact that authentic engagement with the past opens new roads to 
you to approach your future, repetition can be invigorating. Think about what 
happens when you learn more and more about your own culture and its history. 
Your way of understanding your present world opens up. The current fads or 
conventional wisdom become just one interpretation of the world (maybe even 
a superficial one). Investigation of the past reveals new ways to understand life, 
a new undiscovered country to explore. In fact, after you do this, the thinking of 
the “They” seems stale and dead. Embracing your past, in bringing part of you to 
light (your birth), brings a sense of liberation to life. The possibility of a creative 
interaction with your own existence — as an individual — becomes possible.
The importance of choosing your own hero
Heidegger thinks you should look back into the 
past of your heritage to uncover new possibili-
ties, other than those offered by the crowd, for 
understanding how to engage meaningfully 
with life. One of Heidegger’s suggestions is that 
you need to choose your hero from the past, an 
exemplar that you can use to help guide you in 
interpreting and responding to the situations 
you find yourself in with a sense of purpose.
It’s a cool idea. You find a historical hero, and 
in a sense, you have a dialogue with that hero 
about life. Of course, Achilles, who sees battle 
as the way to live an excellent life, would be baf-
fled by the world you live in. But thinking about 
Achilles and the struggles he went through in his 
world can help you see your world in different 
ways, in terms of possibilities not offered by the 
crowd. By having this kind of dialogue with your 
hero, you make him relevant to today’s world, 
making him live through you in the modern world 
as a guide. Of course, the process works both 
ways: The way you view your present world also 
affects the way you think about and interpret 
your hero as a historical figure.

Joining future and past . . . in the present
Although Heidegger sees the future as central, he also sees the present as the 
focus point in which the authentic life comes together into a whole across 
time. Specifically, he thinks that in your actions, the span between your birth 
and your death is tied together in a way that allows you to see and engage 
with your world free from the dictates of “Them.” Heidegger calls this way of 
understanding the present the glance of the eye. You’re committed and reso-
lute, and in light of your engagement with the past, you have an ability to see 
how the present situation is meaningful, to see the possibilities it discloses 
for you. In light of your engagement with your future and with your death, 
you’re resolute and committed in your choices.
 
Remember that for Heidegger, as for many existentialists, authentic life requires 
engaging with the world in a way that fully embraces what you are as an exist-
ing being. One aspect that existentialism thinks is central is engagement. Your 
existence is fundamentally action-oriented. As well, your existence has a span in 
time; it ends in the future (in death) and begins in the past (in terms of your his-
tory, culture, or heritage). As a consequence, you should expect that existing in 
the present can have inauthentic and authentic forms. Action in the present can 
seek to represent that full unity, or it can fail to bring the self together and allow 
only parts of it to be represented in the way that you live.
The inauthentic present: “Making present”
As you probably expect, the inauthentic past means an immersion in the 
“They.” But how does this play out in the inauthentic present? For one, reso-
luteness doesn’t exist. In its place, you lack commitments. You have no con-
nection with life and instead you float superficially over it.
In Chapter 6 we talk more about this, in the phenomenon Heidegger calls 
falling. He argues that your way of engaging with life can be marked by a 
kind of disconnection, a being “lost in the world.” Think of the way gossip 
works; how it passes from one person to the next; how with each person who 
repeats the gossip, the person’s connection to life itself becomes more and 
more distant. This is how the inauthentic present works. When the gossip 
changes (when what “one does” changes), so do your actions. As a result, 
your identity has no self-defined character. As an individual, you aren’t 
plugged into the world in an active way. You coast along, determined by the 
external currents of opinion around you.
The inauthentic present is marked by shallowness. No sense of you is impli-
cated in what you do. Your actions don’t implicate your sense of mission in 
life or your sense of self-determination. You don’t bring to the present a way 
of structuring what’s possible that’s individual to you. Your actions don’t 
highlight your past and future. Instead, they express the chatter of the every-
day world. To the person lost in the inauthentic present, death is an abstract 
subject, and the past has no impact on what’s being done now.

201
 Chapter 9: Finding Authenticity: Facing Death, Conscience, and Time
Imagine a person with an addiction — drawn to a continual flow of new, 
pleasurable experiences (similar to what Kierkegaard calls rotation method in 
Chapter 10). He runs from party to party, from one fun event to the next. Like 
a bird mesmerized by shiny objects, this kind of person is caught up in the 
glitter of the passing experiences in the “now.” The past, the future, and how 
they implicate and inform your own sense of self — all these things are of no 
importance at all. Not for us, say the existentialists!
The authentic present: The glance of the eye
Heidegger calls the authentic way of existing in the present Augenblick. In 
German, this means glance of the eye. It’s an odd phrase to use, but it actually 
does make sense. In the authentic present, the world is transformed and seen 
in a new way. Your world, and your existence, take on a very particular kind 
of significance right before your very eyes.
Heidegger thinks that in the Augenblick, in the way that you interact with the 
world, the following four things come together:
 
 Your embrace of death means that your actions are resolute.
 
 You’re committed to the task of forging ahead into the future as an 
individual.
 
 You forcefully seek to engage that challenge in the way that you live.
 
 Your way of seeing what’s possible for you in your situation is disclosed 
by the way in which you’re continually engaging authentically with your 
past.
But how? In what way should your resolve express itself? Imagine a resolute 
person with his fist thrust in the air defiantly raised against the “They,” yelling 
“Yes!” But yes what? All you know is that you can’t live through “Them.” To take 
that route is to become irresolute and to give up on the seriousness of life and 
on the task of defining your own path. Thus, in your resolute commitment, you 
turn to yourself — to your past and your heritage — and find possibilities to help 
you engage with the situations in life in a meaningful way that allows you not to 
become lost in the world, or lost in what “They” dictate.
After you find new options and possibilities in the past (and perhaps a hero 
to team up with; see the nearby sidebar “The importance of choosing your 
own hero”) you return to the present, where it all comes together in the moment 
or in the glance of the eye. In the Augenblick, your resolute embrace of death 
and seriousness of choice are joined with your penetration of the past, your 
heritage, and your selection of new possibilities. This joining of the two sides 
of your existence (past and future, birth and death) is now expressed in the way 
you act in and see the present. Your life as a whole is unified; your present situa-
tion and your action make sense in a story that connects your past and your pres-
ent and your future. You’re finally an authentic individual. Well, at least for the 
moment. You have to keep it up, you know!

Kierkegaard: The Task of Being 
a Religious Existentialist
In This Chapter
 Investigating Kierkegaard’s notion of the self
 Analyzing despair, or the failure to be a self
 Discussing Kierkegaard’s three main spheres of life
 Exploring why Kierkegaard believes only the religious life is truly authentic
O
ne of the easiest misconceptions to fall under when you encounter 
existentialism is to think that it’s incompatible with religion. If you’ve 
been thinking this very thing, it’s understandable, especially given some of 
the strong antireligious attitudes that many of the existentialists display. If 
you’re religious, Kierkegaard is your guy; he believes strongly that existential 
concerns and religion are strongly connected.
Like all existentialists, Kierkegaard argues that striving to exist in a passionate 
fashion, by making real individual choices and commitments about the direction 
of your life, is essential. Kierkegaard also shares the key existential belief that 
real authentic choices about the big questions in life require risks, because you 
can never be certain that the path you choose or the answer you embrace is 
the right one. His reason is typically existentialist: The world itself contains no 
truths, values, or signposts that can tell you what to do. Questioning life and 
choosing a path to follow must be performed alone, as a solitary individual.
Existentialists believe that an awareness of this radical freedom to choose 
among different paths in life produces strong feelings of anxiety in people. 
More times than not, they try to escape those feelings by denying the freedom 
and responsibility at the core of what it means to be a self. People do this by 
turning to inauthentic modes of living that seek to blot out individual choice, 
commitment, or risk. Of course, by blotting these out, you also deny the core 
of what it means to exist as the individual you are.

204
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In this chapter, we look at Kierkegaard’s notion of the self and then turn to 
how the challenge to be a self can go wrong and one can as a result fall into 
despair or sin. We then look at Kierkegaard’s notion of the three stages of life, 
examining how each of these stages or spheres of life represents a different 
way in which a person can approach the task of existing. Two of these stages, 
the aesthetic and the ethical, are inauthentic. Only the third, the religious, 
allows someone to truly become a self and to authentically exist. We turn to 
the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac to make this point clear.
Although this stance isn’t shared by all the existentialists, for Kierkegaard 
only an embrace of religious faith can avert false attempts to hide from anxi-
ety or from the task of being a self. True passion, commitment, and risk can 
be found only in a leap of faith that embraces the aspects of your existence 
that you can’t in any way rationally understand. In short, a true religious life 
is the attempt to embrace the absurd (a central existentialist notion) that lies 
at the core of your existence, an embrace that will in the end acknowledge 
that your existence is dependent upon something greater than yourself. In 
Kierkegaard’s view, that’s God!
Sickness unto Death: To Be 
or Not to Be Your Self
The existentialists are centrally concerned with the self and with issues of 
freedom. Kierkegaard says that being a self is a task that requires embracing 
your freedom, something that you have to continually work at. To do this, 
he argues, you must make choices about how to engage with life, and those 
choices must express honestly both what you presently are (what’s fixed 
about you) and what’s possible for you (what’s open to you). In addition, 
being a self requires acknowledging your dependency upon the divine.
Unfortunately, people often reject this task because coming face to face with 
their freedom causes anxiety. Seeking instead to flee what they are, they 
allow the different elements of the self (what you are and what you can be) 
to fall into disarray, with one side becoming overrepresented in comparison 
with the other. When this happens, your life choices express a false view of 
what it means for you to exist as the whole being that you are.
Kierkegaard calls this fall away from wholeness despair. From his perspective, 
because the various ways of failing to be a self all share a fundamental refusal 
to acknowledge what you truly are, which itself includes a recognition of your 
relationship to God, despair turns out to be a way of living in sin.

205
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
The self: A tension of opposites
Kierkegaard believes that being a self is something you have to work at. It 
requires what he calls spirit, an effort of will directed at holding together 
what Kierkegaard sees as the different parts of the self. One way to think of 
those parts is to refer to the difference between what a person is at any given 
time and what that person can be. Being a self means being conscious of that 
tension within you and striving to grapple with, in the concrete situations 
that you live through, what’s fixed and what’s possible by working to repre-
sent them both in how you approach those situations.
Clearly, a lot of facts are true about you. You were born into a certain culture 
with a certain history. Some physical facts are true of you. You feel pleasure 
and pain. Some facts are true of your social world and your position in it. You 
were born into a certain family. You have a certain genetic makeup with cer-
tain talents. When you think of it this way, it is clear that at any given specific 
time, it’s true that you are a certain particular person. Being in a concrete 
situation involves finding yourself in a very specific, real world.
Kierkegaard uses a number of terms to express this aspect of what you are, 
sometimes saying that it represents what’s finite, bodily, necessary, or tem-
poral. All these highfalutin terms come together to point out that you live in 
the real world, so they point to the need for you to acknowledge realities on 
the ground.
 
But don’t worry; fear not! You’re not just a pile of fixed or finite facts. You’re also 
a soul. Although certain fixed realities always make up you and your world, dif-
ferent paths are always open to you in any concrete situation. In other words, 
you have a capacity for self-determination. Part of being a self is the ability to 
think outside the box about your own life. After all, you always get to choose 
how to view the facts in your world. You’re free and have the capacity to choose 
who you can or should be, how to carve a path for yourself within the reality 
you live in. To describe this, Kierkegaard uses a different set of terms — infinite, 
soul, eternal, and possibility — to get at this aspect of what you are.
 
For Kierkegaard, for you to be a self partly turns out to be a way of living that 
emerges from grappling honestly with your own freedom — with your own 
ability to think outside the box about life, at the same time always acknowl-
edging the context that forms the basis for the real, actual world you live in.

206
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
The hard work of being a self: Bringing 
together polar opposites
Kierkegaard thinks you need to work hard at being a self. Being finite means 
that at any given instant, some things are always fixed about you. But 
because you also embody the infinite, or the possible, you transcend or can 
think outside the box about your own existence. So although your finitude 
constrains you, it doesn’t determine your path. To be a self means to work 
to keep those two aspects as close together as possible in the way you make 
choices or in the way that you choose to approach your life.
When coauthor Chris was a kid, he was intrigued by magnets. If you take two 
magnets and try to connect similarly charged ends, they repel each other, so 
you have to work hard to bring them closer and closer together. Kierkegaard 
thinks that the aspects of the self work in much the same way. They repel 
each other because they’re opposites, so you have to work to bring them 
closer together in your choices.
 
Philosophers think that opposites can’t exist in the same place at the same 
time. If a person is 6 feet tall, he can’t also be 6 foot 2. If an object is round, it 
can’t also be square. You can think about Kierkegaard’s task of being a self in 
a similar way. Can the self be finite and infinite? Can it be what’s necessary and 
what’s possible? Can it be body and soul at one time? Can you be something 
fixed but at the same time transcend what you are?
The parts of the self are opposites, so they strongly repel one another. In the 
self, the temptation is always to allow the parts to come apart and become 
distant from one another. This happens by over-representing one side of 
the self over the other when you make choices. In doing so, you lose sight of 
what’s involved in your real, concrete existence, which always includes both 
elements.
Think of the two possibilities available for overrepresenting one side over 
the other. First, you can too heavily weight what’s fixed in your situation to 
the detriment of representing what’s possible. Typically, this results in living 
passively, as though you’re a prisoner of fate who has no active role to play 
in your life. At the same time, overrepresenting possibility to the detriment 
of what’s fixed means living in a daydream world about what could be. In 
this case, you lose touch with the real, concrete world. What you need to do 
to truly exist as a self is to strive to choose in a way that grapples with what 
both aspects reveal in a given concrete situation.
Of course, the closer you bring them together, the harder it is to keep them that 
way or to bring the opposites closer together still — just like those magnets. 
The harder you try, the more you feel the strong repulsion between them, and 
thus, the stronger you’ll feel the temptation to let the opposites become dis-
tant and disconnected by overrepresenting one to the detriment of the other. 

207
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
If you think about it, Kierkegaard is telling you that being a self requires living 
with a spirit of resolve and resistance. The task of being a self means fighting 
to refuse to let yourself give in to that temptation to let the self fall apart.
Being a self before God
Part of being a self means honestly representing what you are and what you 
can or should be. Kierkegaard thinks, however, that being a self requires 
something more — at some point, you have to recognize that you can’t fully 
succeed at being a self without divine help.
 
For Kierkegaard, the ultimate goal is to become a self, or to live in a way that 
ultimately expresses what you truly are. It’s to be authentic, being true to 
what you are and what you can be. But Kierkegaard thinks that this task, at 
a higher level, is too much for anyone to handle on her own. As Kierkegaard 
puts it, at some point the self, to be what it truly is, must acknowledge the 
“power which constituted it.” He’s saying that you must recognize that your 
selfhood is ultimately dependent upon a power that’s independent of you. 
What this means is that the authenticity you strive for in your existence is, at 
some point, beyond your control.
Later in this chapter, we talk about the specific way in which you come to 
this recognition or acknowledgment. For now, it’s important to see that 
Kierkegaard thinks a central component of being a self requires the action of 
reaching out and seeking divine assistance. What this means is that making 
real choices incorporates an aspect of submission before God. Authentic self-
hood, at its core, has a religious dimension for Kierkegaard.
Despair: Attempting to
escape your true self
People often fail at the task of being a self, resulting in despair or a condition 
Kierkegaard calls the “sickness unto death.” Despair occurs when the oppo-
sites that compose your existence, between what you are and what you can 
be, fall out of proper balance.
One reason you may want to escape the task of selfhood is anxiety. Anxiety 
can be a very disorienting and discomforting feeling, one that various exis-
tentialists have described as the kind of uneasy “dizziness” you feel when 
you sense the true nature of your freedom (if anxiety is something you want 
to investigate further, see Chapter 4 for more!). The point is simple: The more 
you strive to engage with life in an honest and authentic way, the more you 
become fully conscious of the burden of the responsibility of selfhood.

208
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
That means that in striving to be a self, you become aware of your role in 
giving what’s possible and what’s fixed in your world its own proper place. Of 
course, you also become aware that there’s no rule book to show you how to 
do it right. You simply must choose on your own. That’s scary and is sure to 
cause a little anxiety!
 
Think about your life. Every time you choose, the set of what’s fixed and pos-
sible for you in a concrete situation changes. Each moment of your life, your 
destiny is in your own hands. Every time a door opens and you choose it, 
the others close forever; now new doors, specific to the choice you’ve made, 
open. Thought of in this way, choosing is really a heavy responsibility, and the 
consequences of choice for your own identity are monumental.
 
Choosing your own path is exhilarating. But it can also feel disheartening 
when you face the fact that Kierkegaard thinks that you can’t lean on any 
signs or truths external to you for support. The way in which you choose to 
represent what’s fixed or possible in a concrete situation can never be verified 
as being right. You’ll never know for sure that the doors that opened to you, 
which are based on how you interpreted what was fixed and possible, were 
appropriate to the situation.
Every time you choose, you do it alone, with only yourself as support. True 
authentic choice, especially when it deals with the question of determining 
the character and direction of your own life, is inherently risky. For some, 
the anxiety that results from these facts is too much to take. So they let one 
element in the self become overrepresented in a way that makes them feel 
better about their situation.
Say that your friends are advising you about some bad situation you’ve 
gotten yourself into. They say that you’ll need to make some tough choices 
and try to create a different possible future for yourself. Instead of facing the 
anxiety that stems from taking control of your life, you withdraw into passiv-
ity, claiming that your lot is just inevitable, given the facts about yourself and 
your situation. You wind up overemphasizing what’s necessary and fixed, 
and as a result, you give yourself an excuse to refuse to take an active role in 
your life as a free and responsible individual.
You may accomplish the same aim of escaping the anxiety of freedom by over-
emphasizing the possible in your situation. When you’re in that bad situation, 
you don’t think about what you can do to fix it. Instead, you withdraw into a dif-
ferent kind of passivity, into a daydreaming kind of existence. You spend your 
day picturing all the people that you could be, but without ever making any of 
the actual choices needed to try to make one of those possibilities into reality.
Either way, Kierkegaard would say that you’ve chosen the path of despair. 
You have the worst kind of sickness, a sickness of the self — one in which 
you desperately try to escape being who you are and thus lead yourself into 
a way of living that’s existentially unhealthy. If holding the self together is a 
portrait of wholeness, despair is what happens when you fall apart.

209
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
Despair: The path to sin
Kierkegaard thinks that the task of being a self requires two things:
 
 Properly holding together in a state of tension the different aspects of 
what you are as a self
 
 At some point, achieving this goal through a recognition of your 
dependency on the divine
Although the two are closely related (you can’t do one without the other), 
this way of framing the issue provides two reasons for you to see why a person 
might fall into despair. It also reveals that for Kierkegaard, always the Christian 
existentialist, despair takes on a religious dimension — namely, sin.
Weakness
Kierkegaard says that the despair of weakness is motivated by a desire to not 
be the free self that you are. You realize on some level that you’re free, but 
you give in to the weakness of allowing the oppositions within yourself to 
become overrepresented. Perhaps you give in to the desire to see yourself as 
a victim of fate or to disappear within a dreamlike world of possibility. Either 
way, you give in to a weakness so as not to have to face up to the conditions 
of your actual concrete existence.
Defiance
You can also fall into despair by overemphasizing your own freedom and power. 
Here, Kierkegaard says that you’re motivated by a desire to be what you are; 
you want to be self-determining. You even become prideful about it. This is the 
despair of defiance; you believe that you can do the job of becoming a self all on 
your own. You refuse to recognize your dependency on God to be what you are 
or to succeed at the task of selfhood. You refuse, as Kierkegaard says, to “rec-
ognize that you are brought into being by that power.” In fact, for Kierkegaard, 
the Devil is the most extreme case of defiance; although the Devil recognizes the 
existence of God, he refuses to acknowledge his dependence on him.
Both holding together the oppositions within you and seeking out divine 
assistance to complete the task are required to be a self. So whether despair 
is weak or defiant (Kierkegaard actually states that all despair is a mixture 
of both), it all comes to the same thing: By failing to be a self, you turn your 
back on God, because your true state or condition is that of being a self 
before God. If you understand sin as turning your back on God, it becomes 
clear that choosing to exist in despair is sin.
 
Misunderstanding this point is easy. Clearly, to despair doesn’t require doing 
anything sinful in the ordinary sense. By saying that despair is sin, Kierkegaard 
doesn’t mean that it entails treating someone badly or causing anyone pain. 
Instead, saying that despair is sin is like saying that you’ve willfully oriented 

210
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
your self toward existence in the wrong way. It means being guilty of not treat-
ing your life with the seriousness that it demands. It means choosing not to 
be whole. A churchgoing person who has never broken a law or entertained 
a single thought of doing anyone any harm can still live in a completely sinful 
state in this way. You can be in despair and still be a morally good person (a 
subject we talk more about at the end of this chapter).
Inauthentic Life Stages: 
Aesthetic and Ethical
Kierkegaard says you should strive to make choices in a way that highlights 
the nature of your individual, concrete self. Concrete selves don’t give either 
aspect — fixed or possible — too much emphasis. Instead, they properly rep-
resent both aspects in the way in which they make choices.
Sadly, people often fail at being their concrete selves and instead live in despair, 
falling into one of the two inauthentic life stages that Kierkegaard calls the aes-
thetic and the ethical. Each stage represents a different way of failing to be a self. 
Only the third stage, the religious, is authentic and free of despair.
The aesthetic stage: Life without choices
Aesthetes refuse to pull together the opposing aspects of the self in choice, 
so they fail to meaningfully represent what’s factual and possible within their 
actual lived experiences. Aesthetes avoid all commitments and simply refuse 
to choose a path in life; they lack spirit and direction, and thus have no self at 
all. They’re like small children who refuse to grow up and choose who to be 
in life. Aesthetes don’t take an active position in determining the significance 
of their existence. Instead, they find significance and meaning in their lives 
through the enjoyment of passive experiences.
For Kierkegaard, it’s important to remember that being spirited, which the 
aesthetic person lacks, requires at least the following two things:
 
 Actively struggling with the question of what and who you are; taking an 
active role in determining the significance of your life
 
 Striving to integrate the status of that ongoing struggle into your life 
through choices and commitments about how to live
Struggling with the question of the very meaning of your own existence isn’t 
easy. In fact, it’s painful. It requires a lot of self-analysis, a lot of self-criticism, 
and a great deal of honesty about the role that your own freedom plays in 

211
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
determining your own destiny. Because this struggle with existence isn’t 
pleasant, and because it often involves anxiety, most people jump ship and 
fall into a life of despair.
Aesthetes jump ship by refusing to take their lives seriously. They refuse to 
acknowledge that they’re existing beings with the freedom to carve a mean-
ingful path for themselves through life. Embracing a life of freedom would 
mean making spirited commitments about the direction your life should take 
and holding yourself accountable to them. If you’ve committed to being a cer-
tain kind of person, you think of the future as composed of a set of situations 
in which you’ll strive to remain faithful to the self-identity you’ve chosen. The 
aesthete wants to avoid all this. The aesthete doesn’t want accountability or 
to feel obligated to any commitments she made in the past. Instead, the aes-
thete wants to live carefree, in the moment, with no sense of unity over time 
or direction or clear purpose.
 
Spirited people take an active role in finding meaning in life. They come at life 
through their self-determining choices. The aesthete is the opposite; she seeks 
distraction. Instead of making a commitment, she chooses to be entertained 
by pleasure or to pursue what’s agreeable or interesting. Basically, aesthetes 
want to detach from existence or life and watch it from afar. They’re like spec-
tators. They want to experience life like it’s a movie. In other words, they don’t 
participate in life; they want to eat from a bucket of popcorn and kick back 
and enjoy the experiences life throws at them — all from the safety of their 
theater seat, of course. The aesthetic life is inherently passive.
The aesthetic life just won’t work
The aesthetic life can’t sustain itself. It’s ultimately self-defeating. It typically 
posits the meaning of self-fulfillment in some form of rotation method — in 
learning to cultivate experiences of either pleasure or interesting possibility 
as a way to escape from the emptiness of not engaging with the fundamental 
human task of being a real self. But these escape attempts are futile.
No one has the ability to keep it up. Think of how it works. You start by feel-
ing an emptiness right at the center of your life. It calls on you to embrace 
your freedom and take up the question of the meaning of your life. But it isn’t 
pleasurable. So you use aesthetic distraction, either through hedonism or 
mental mind manipulation, to try to avoid it.
But no matter how good you are, the pleasure of an experience ends; now 
you’re back at the beginning all over again. Oh no. That means . . . back to 
anxiety! The answer? Quick — find another distracting experience! It ends, and 
more anxiety follows. Aestheticism never cures or even faces up to anxiety; 
it just desperately works to keep it at bay. As a result, the aesthetic life just 
seems to burn itself out. It’s like doing drugs; the more you do, the more you 
need to do. You always need bigger and better experiences to do the job. It’s 
not sustainable. Eventually, you run out of gas and collapse!

212
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
In addition, the aesthetic life takes self-fulfillment and hands it over to the 
world. No matter what you do or how good you are, the world will always 
hand you experiences that will frustrate your attempts to live in pleasure. 
You can’t control the world. This will leave you bitter and may lead you to 
start wrongly thinking of the course of your life as being dictated by fate or 
destiny.
Finally, the failure of the aesthetic life can simply be seen in its lack of dig-
nity. All aesthetes, on one level or another, try to withdraw from active par-
ticipation in life. An aesthete doesn’t want to be a real engaged self, charting 
a determined course into the future on the basis of her choices. In the end, 
the aesthetic life just seems to reduce human existence to a type of animal 
life. Aren’t you better than that? Isn’t life more than pleasure, the agreeable, 
or the interesting?
The unconscious aesthete: Sleepwalking through life
One way to be an aesthete is to be an unconscious aesthete. This is a par-
ticularly curious form of aestheticism. This type of aesthete is unconscious 
because she’s not particularly self-reflective about what she is. She interacts 
with the world, but with no real notion of self. In a sense, the unconscious 
aesthete is like an animal, moved in this direction or that always as a result 
of sensing what’s agreeable or disagreeable in the situation at hand. At times, 
Kierkegaard uses the fictional character Don Juan as an example of this aes-
thete, a person pulled by the forces of his bodily needs (in this case, by his 
sensual impulses). However, the unconscious aesthete can also be a social 
being, one who lives in mindless conformity to what’s agreeable and away 
from what’s not.
 
To understand Kierkegaard’s point, think of a laboratory rat. Set up a maze, 
and put cheese in some corridors and electric shocks in other ones. Now 
place the rat inside. Quickly, the rat learns how to move through the maze to 
avoid the shocks and get the cheese. How? As purely natural or bodily crea-
tures, rats are biologically programmed to avoid pain and pursue pleasure.
The unconscious aesthete is like a rat, but she lives in a social maze rather 
than a laboratory maze. Quickly, she learns where the shocks and the cheese 
are located within society. If you’re a woman, tan often, because then men 
will look at you approvingly. Buy more stuff, because you want to keep up 
with the Joneses — the people most approved of! You go to church not 
because you feel a real connection to God, but because in a Christian com-
munity, that’s what Christians do. After all, what would “they” think if you 
didn’t? You know — you’d get shocked by the pains of disapproval!
As far as Kierkegaard sees it, the unconscious aesthete has no view of herself 
as spirit or as an actively self-determining being who can take charge of her 
own existence. Instead, the spirit in these people lies dormant and is sleeping. 
They live like the rat must live, moving this way or that simply as a result of 
the type of experiences those different paths offer up. Of course, this aesthete 

213
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
always has a choice, but she seems to have no consciousness of herself as a 
being capable of real self-direction. In a way, the unconscious aesthete is like 
a child, driven by what’s agreeable or disagreeable.
Isn’t this particularly undignified? As Kierkegaard sees it, it’s like choosing to 
live in the dingy basement of a beautiful home (the self) and choosing never 
to occupy its more sophisticated upper floors. Clearly, no one would literally 
do that with a real house. So why do some live that way with respect to their 
own selfhood? Living like a rat when one is capable of much more?
Think of this kind of aesthete as being conscious of her surroundings (she 
doesn’t, of course, run into walls!) but not self-conscious, similar to the rat 
(only the rat doesn’t have a self to be conscious of!). She isn’t conscious of 
the possibility of spirited, free living. As a result, she’s like a zombie — the 
living dead. She understands what she is only in terms of what she does. As 
Kierkegaard puts it: “The man of immediacy does not know himself; he quite 
literally identifies himself only by the clothes he wears, he identifies having a 
self by externalities.”
 
Unlike the rat, you aren’t just a creature in the natural world, determined to 
act in accord with the cravings and desires of your body. The way of being 
lost in the body, or in a view of existence that values only agreeable experi-
ences, can take different forms within society, like a slavish robotic devotion 
to the following:
 
 Acquisition of material goods, such as money or possessions
 
 Attainment of approved social positions
 
 Cultivation of the majority’s beliefs and opinions
The hedonistic aesthete: Pleasure is king!
Some aesthetes are more conscious of their despair, so they realize on some 
level, even if only minimally, that they aren’t living in a dignified way. They 
show a glimmer of self-consciousness about themselves and so about their 
own condition. They know, on some level, that a spirited free component is 
part of what they are, and as a result, they know that the aesthetic life, which 
is passive and nonspirited, is undignified. Still, these aesthetes don’t want to 
acknowledge this truth fully and deal with it, because it’s painful. As a result, 
they strive to cover up their own lack of dignity by distracting themselves 
with hedonistic pleasures.
 
When do you think the intuition that you’re spirit tends to become clear? 
Probably when you’re alone, not doing anything, and faced just with your self. 
You see that there’s a self that you should be, a self that takes control of its own 
existence, chooses itself, and gives its own life a passionate direction. Of course, 
this realization comes with a healthy dose of anxiety, so that’s not pleasant.

214
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
As a result, a conscious aesthete needs a plan, a way to avoid those self-realizations 
and escape anxiety. The typical plan of the aesthete is to stay very busy. That 
allows her to avoid those painful moments of self-reflective clarity.
In his work Either/Or, one of Kierkegaard’s fictional characters, an aesthete 
amusingly called “A,” expresses this insight. He suggests that “boredom is 
the greatest evil” and advises what he calls rotation method as a response. 
One type of rotation is called field rotation — in short, learning to cycle 
through faster, more frequent, and more intense entertainment as a means 
of keeping boredom, and the clarity about the nature of the self and with it 
one’s own despair, at bay. Life for the field rotator is about lots of distrac-
tions and pleasures. The more you can get, the better and more significant 
life is. Party on, dude!
 
Obviously, the field rotator avoids commitments. Why bother? You should 
always live for the moment, the field rotator suggests, and at any moment 
you need to be on the lookout for better and more intense experiences. That 
means always living in the moment. Coauthor Chris knew a guy who would 
never commit to coming to a party at his house. If he did intend to come, 
Chris would know it only when he arrived. As a field rotator, this guy clearly 
thought, “Why make a commitment to go to Chris’s when something more 
pleasurable might come up in the meantime?” To the field rotator, commit-
ments are totally illogical. As an aesthete, you’d never commit to do X tomor-
row when you don’t know whether some other option Y might pop up that 
would be more exciting and intense than X.
Freeze frame: Try this yourself
Are you a field rotator? Ask yourself:
  Do you find yourself often talking about how 
bored you are?
  Are you always in search of something to 
do?
  Do you find inactivity painful and stressful?
  Do you sense a feeling of anxious empti-
ness when you’re doing nothing?
  Do you avoid commitments and decisions 
until the very last moment?
  Do you have a difficult time being alone?
  Do you find yourself text-messaging often 
just to be able to do something?
If you find yourself answering yes to too many 
of these questions, chances are good that 
you’re an aesthete and most likely a field rota-
tor. According to Kierkegaard, the more this is 
true of you, the more you should expect your 
personality to be disorganized and fragmentary 
and your life without clear purpose. Because 
you’re oriented only toward the enjoyment of the 
moment, you don’t try to cultivate any coherent 
personality around any kind of life goal.

 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
The reflective aesthete: Lost in the imagination
Imagine a person who suddenly awakens from a long deception, one that 
hides from that person the fact that her future isn’t determined. This kind 
of person would awaken more self-conscious than ever before and would be 
amazed at the new world of possibilities that emerges before her. The spir-
ited person would learn to make responsible choices by carving out a self 
from the possibilities presented. But the reflective aesthete doesn’t do that. 
Instead, when she becomes more and more aware of her self as a self-
determining power, she becomes more addicted to her newly found world of 
the possible that opens before her. It becomes a new way to escape.
Because the reflective aesthete is an aesthete, she’s still devoted to enjoyment. 
Like other aesthetes, the reflective aesthete is also devoted to not living in an 
active sense; instead, she’s passive. In the case of the reflective aesthete, that 
passivity is demonstrated by a withdrawal into the mind and into the world of 
the possible that the imagination can provide. As one of Kierkegaard’s fictional 
reflective aesthetes puts it, “The essence of pleasure does not lie in the thing 
enjoyed, but in the accompanying consciousness.” The reflective aesthete 
doesn’t just want to experience pleasure as a result of being affected by plea-
surable things in the world like a field rotator. Instead, this aesthete wants the 
pleasure to come from ways of imaginatively manipulating the world. The goal 
of this aesthete is the mental cultivation of interesting experiences.
 
The reflective aesthete, Kierkegaard suggests, does this by using the world as 
fodder for the creation of different ways of thinking about things. The reflective 
aesthete is so interested in possibility, in thinking about things in the world, 
that she becomes largely detached from the way things really are; fantasy is 
all that matters now. As one of Kierkegaard’s aesthetic characters says, with a 
tinge of addiction in his voice, “Pleasure disappoints; possibility never. And what 
wine was so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!”
It’s pretty clear how the reflective aesthete fails to make commitments. To 
be committed to a task or to a particular identity, you have to choose a con-
crete identity and path. You have to select a possibility that gives meaning 
to your life and make it actual. In other words, possibility is meaningful when 
it plays a role in helping you figure out how to live in the actual world you 
inhabit. Real choices give you particular direction in your concrete world. 
But the reflective aesthete isn’t interested in this because she has no desire 
to live in the real world at all. She wants to live in her head, fantasizing 
about and cycling through all the different ways that particular things could 
be. Kierkegaard calls this crop rotation. Instead of cycling through different 
worldly experiences (as the field rotator does), you take one experience and 
cycle through different ways of thinking about it or envisioning it. You get 
creative, even artistic, about the way you think of the world.

216
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
You know the type. You’re always saying to the person, “Hey, come back 
down to reality” or “Earth to Chris . . . you in there, Chris?” They’re in there 
all right — in their heads, imagining possibilities — and that’s where they 
want to stay!
The ethical stage: Finding 
your meaning within roles
After aestheticism, which is noted for its lack of spirit and its refusal to make 
choices and commitments about how to make something of one’s life, the 
next stage of despair is the ethical. In this stage, a person has moved out of 
the aesthetic stage and is finally ready to make commitments and choices 
about who to be and how to live. The ethicist does this by freely electing 
to take her place in a larger social and moral structure — what we call the 
Universal. The Universal is the set of objective moral truths that functions 
as the foundation of meaningful and appropriate worldly interaction. After 
you choose to subordinate yourself to the Universal and to accept your role 
within its overarching system of meaning, you have a road map to under-
standing how to engage with life in a meaningful way.
Although the ethical stage is an advance on the aesthetic life, because it 
embraces the necessity of choosing and committing to a way of life, the ethi-
cal stage is still a form of despair, or a way to avoid being a self, for the fol-
lowing two reasons:
 
 The ethical stage assumes that a person can find the answer to the 
question “How do I engage with the world?” without the need for any 
contribution by the specific individual herself. Instead, the Universal has 
all the answers and provides the rule book for living meaningfully. For 
Kierkegaard, however, this means that you haven’t truly held the tension 
within the self together, because meaningful choices always come 
Freeze frame: Try this one too
Are you a reflective aesthete?
  Do you find yourself lost in the intense plea-
sure of daydreaming?
  Do you get resentful that the real world can 
get in the way of how you like to think of it?
  Do you fantasize often about your past, rei-
magining it in different ways?
  Do you avoid making choices because 
you like thinking about the possibilities the 
alternatives make available to you?
If you answer yes to too many of these ques-
tions, you likely have some reflective aesthete 
in you. In fact, a lot of people you know probably 
say that you live inside your own head!

217
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
alongside the feeling of risk — to the extent that you can’t tell whether 
you’ve made the right choice. The ethical life, however, seems to suggest 
that you can know what the right choice is, so risk as an element of indi-
vidual (and spirited) existence disappears. Life is too ambiguous for that!
 
 Kierkegaard thinks that the ethical life inevitably leads to a return of despair 
because its goals are ultimately unattainable. Thus, although the ethical 
life suggests that we can attain happiness by subordinating our individual 
desires and needs and wants to the dictates of the Universal, we just can’t 
ever seem to be able to do this. The ethical life, as a result, leaves us feeling 
perpetually guilty; frustrated; and, in all likelihood, miserable.
The importance of choosing yourself
The ethicist thinks of the aesthete as someone who wants to be free to do 
whatever she wants, whenever she wants. As the ethicist puts it, the aes-
thete is a multiplicity, or an assortment of faceless masks. She’s all style, no 
substance. Because she refuses to choose a stable identity, one that actu-
ally makes demands on her, she’s actually no one. Moreover, the aesthete 
secretly knows she’s in despair because she can’t avoid the nagging truth 
that she’s living in an undignified way.
According to the ethicist, the aesthete has an either/or choice to make. Either 
she can remain in this hopelessly passive life, knowing that it’s futile, or she 
can choose herself by embracing a stable identity and committing to it. To 
make the choice to leave the aesthetic realm, however, the aesthete must 
first experience its final futility. The aesthete must separate herself from that 
life and judge it unworthy, as something subordinate to the ethical life. The 
aesthete can give up this life only by renouncing it.
Are philosophers reflective aesthetes?
One of the interesting claims that Kierkegaard 
makes is that philosophers, especially those 
who tend to deal in large-scale concepts and 
theories, are reflective aesthetes trying to 
avoid the world. Funny enough, this is what 
most people say — that philosophers live 
in an ivory tower and avoid the real world. Is 
this true? Well, the craft of philosophy does 
typically deal with abstractions. Philosophers 
construct a number of abstract concepts that 
they claim represent the world and then they 
try to see what relationships obtain between 
those concepts. Essentially, they develop ideas 
about the world and then they just deal with the 
ideas from that point out. Of course, you may 
object that these abstractions aren’t really the 
concrete world at all. So philosophers take a bit 
from reality and then use their imaginations to 
construct a more interesting world to play in. 
Ideas turn out to be the philosopher’s sandbox, 
not the real world. As Kierkegaard might say, 
philosophers like to think about existence, but 
that’s it! They’re not as interested in experienc-
ing existence. The world within the mind is so 
much more interesting, and as a result, they 
show no interest in the real world.

218
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
The ethical life demands that you need to first choose yourself as a chooser. 
You must give up on the aesthetic method of letting experiences and sensa-
tions rule your life. You need to step up to the plate and commit to taking up 
the question of your existence. In doing this, the first step is to commit to not 
being an aesthete. It all starts with committing to growing up! The aesthete 
simply refuses to take herself seriously, so that’s the first step in being a self: 
taking yourself and the task of living seriously. Only on this foundation can 
you begin to choose a more specific identity for yourself.
Choosing yourself by embracing a system
When you decide to live in the ethical stage, Kierkegaard thinks, you can’t 
just choose to choose. You also have to make specific choices about who 
you’re going to be. Specifically, choosing the ethical life means making a free 
choice about joining a social and ethical system — one governed by objective 
rules and structures.
The way the ethicists see it, the structure of the world — and society — is 
very rational. Science shows them why interaction in the physical world 
makes sense or is meaningful. Lucky for them, the ethicists see rules that 
govern the way individuals should interact with their world. Philosophy, 
using reason, can figure out the objective structures that govern human 
action. We can stamp a name on the whole collective set and call it the 
Universal.
It’s Universal because those structures and rules apply across the board to 
all individuals. The Universal says that if a person is in an X type of situa-
tion, she should do Y. Because the Universal transcends the particularity of 
any specific person, however, you as an individual get factored out. What a 
person should do is always a function of the social roles she occupies.
Think of a math formula like “X times 0 = 0.” It says that no matter what number 
you plug into X, you always get the same answer. Similarly, the Universal suggests 
that the nature of the specific individual just doesn’t factor in to the equation. 
So your individuality isn’t important when you’re trying to figure out how to 
live meaningfully in the situations you find yourself in. All you need is knowledge 
of the Universal — of the objective rules that govern human interaction in the 
world and knowledge of your social role in the situation you’re in. For the ethi-
cist, because human interaction is meaningful or significant only when it matches 
the Universal, a person who wants to have a meaningful life has to embrace the 
way of living that it dictates. Essentially, you must learn to subordinate yourself as 
an individual to the Universal.
 
We sense an objection. Perhaps you think that if this is true, living meaning-
fully means being robbed of individual choice, because the only way to exist 
meaningfully is to rigidly conform to the dictates of the Universal.

219
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
The ethicist thinks that if that’s the way you see it, you’ve left out something 
important. You don’t just fall into these social and ethical roles. You freely 
choose them as a self-determining being. To freely choose a role means 
to see the self as significant when it conforms to those roles. Perhaps that 
means that you choose to take your place within society as a son and a hus-
band, as a friend, a teacher, and many other things. You decide to fulfill your 
social destiny, in a way. But don’t forget, the ethicist says, you freely choose 
your place.
According to the ethicist, this way of choosing to live life is a perfect way to 
bring together the oppositions within the self in just the right way. When you 
choose to submit to the Universal, you freely consent to the necessity found 
within that life and its rules and structures.
Including beauty and pleasure in the ethical life
If you’re aesthetically inclined, you no doubt think that the ethical life is boring! 
There’s no beauty or pleasure in choosing to conform to the objective rigid 
rules and structures that govern the human community! The ethicist thinks 
you’ve got it all wrong. The ethical life isn’t just beautiful, but also artistic 
and pleasurable. So it should be appealing to all you closet aesthetes out there. 
So the aesthetic life has a place in the ethical, but its place is subordinate to 
the ethical.
Think of marriage. Although the aesthete sees marriage as boring because it 
demands commitment to a certain way of life, the ethicist sees it differently, 
thinking that true beauty and pleasure can come into being only with 
commitments.
 
Is the ethicist right? When you choose to marry, you promise to love and 
to care for and to be faithful to a person. This vow is more than a reference 
to now. Instead, a marriage commitment stretches across the past and the 
future. As a married person, you’ll see your past as a married person would. 
In addition, you’ll see the future that way too. Specifically, you’ll see it as con-
taining opportunities to be, or fail to be, the kind of person you’ve committed 
to be. In each new situation you’re in, it’s up to you to succeed at being the 
way a married person should be (how that role is structured in that society) in 
that circumstance.
The work of striving to become what you’ve committed to be is similar to treating 
yourself like a bonsai tree. If you find yourself tempted to be unfaithful, you learn 
to prune those desires out of yourself and to cultivate new ones — like the desire 
for fidelity. Your aim is to prune and cultivate your character and your desires 
so that eventually you have only the desires appropriate to being a husband or 
wife. Being a married person is something that you work to become.

220
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Now think of your choice to join the ethical in the same way. Basically, if you 
choose to take your place within the structures of society, you aim to shape 
your own wants and desires so that they perfectly match what your social 
roles expect of you in any given situation. Each time you’re in a new situation, 
you’ll want to feel, see, experience, and act (in short, exist) in the world just as 
those roles demand. You’ll want to be the perfectly pruned social and ethical 
bonsai! Pruning a bonsai tree is an artistic craft, and so is the craft of pruning 
the self. Clearly, the ethical doesn’t reject art and beauty — it transforms it!
The ethicist also thinks that you’ll get a lot of pleasure out of your social 
life. What your roles demand and what you want are in harmony if you’re 
successfully doing your job pruning yourself, so you’ll get a great amount of 
pleasure out of performing your roles.
If the ethicist is right, the ethical life contains pleasure and beauty. So the 
ethical doesn’t jettison the aesthetic; it contains it, but in a way that doesn’t 
let the aesthetic view of what life is predominate. The ethical person claims 
to be in control. She makes choices and commitments. She chooses an iden-
tity for herself and follows through, creating herself in an artistic way to 
become the person she chose to be.
Using ethics to hide from yourself
The ethical life has a kind of seductive quality. C’mon, don’t lie — we know 
you like it! It seems so peaceful, so pleasurable; it’s even artistic. And so har-
monious! You find your place and meaning in the universal ethical rules that 
govern the social roles that constitute your larger community. It’s just like a 
big jigsaw puzzle in which all the pieces fit together and you’ve finally fit your 
piece — namely, you — in! Yet if you’re reading an existentialist, and suddenly 
things get all warm and fuzzy, you should suspect something is amiss.
 
One problem is clear: The ethicist requires that you choose to freely subject 
yourself to a bunch of societal rules and structures governed by the Universal, 
which is itself determined by the impartial dictates of reason. The Universal 
contains the final answers and rules to living a meaningful and significant 
human life. You can have that life if you submit to it.
But what is the job of the individual self here? Where in the ethical life is the 
part where the individual self has to continually grapple with the question of 
how to engage with life, of how to exist in the world in concrete situations? Of 
course, the ethicist suggests that the individual plays a role through continu-
ally recommitting to living in this way. But that’s it.
If you look at it this way, it looks as if the ethicist has decided to hide from 
the responsibility that she has, as an individual, to grapple with the hard 
work of being an active, spirited self. But this requires grappling with situ-
ations as a particular individual in that situation. Turning to a meaning and 
significance found in something external to you won’t do.

221
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
 
As we discuss later in this chapter, this concern also expresses itself in 
Kierkegaard’s attack on the ethical stage from the standpoint of religion. If, he 
argues, the individual’s relationship to God must be central to a meaningful 
life, the individual herself can’t be exhausted by the ethical. The individual 
must still have a significance outside the ethical.
Of course, Kierkegaard’s attack on the ethical life isn’t unexpected. Existentialists 
don’t believe that universal values and truths like the Universal ever exhaust what 
you are. As an individual, you must continually struggle with the responsibility of 
finding your own way.
Failing to capture the ambiguity in life
To choose to subsume the self under the Universal — to strive to live life by 
objective moral rules or structures — really means choosing to cease to live 
as an individual. But here’s another problem. The ethical life claims to deny a 
central facet of existence — that it’s essentially ambiguous.
 
Think about the times you’ve made big decisions in your life. Doesn’t it seem 
that rule-following fails to do justice to what you actually did when you made 
your choice? In really important situations, it’s rare that a cookbooklike 
response will suffice. Somewhere along the line, you have to fudge a little to 
make the rules fit that situation. It’s as though the concrete situations that you 
live in are round holes and the rules are square pegs. You need to do a lot of 
cheating to get that peg to fit into that hole. Kierkegaard’s point here is intui-
tive. The answers to big questions about life (such as “How should I live?”) 
can’t be prepackaged and given to you.
The ethical life fails to deliver on its promises
One of the central claims of the ethical life is that it promises a kind of whole-
ness, or a life of happiness within the secure confines of society and the roles 
that you elect to take on. If you decide to be a father and a teacher and a 
friend, you’ll find ultimate happiness and significance in life when you’ve suc-
cessfully learned to discipline the self so that its desires conform perfectly to 
what those roles demand.
But can that ever truly happen? It seems that this promise of fulfillment is 
one that can’t be cashed in. As an individual, you resist being stuffed into 
those constraining roles. As a result, you always seem to have desires and 
hopes and aspirations that rub up against those categories and so cause 
friction in your life. As a result, the ethical life doesn’t deliver on its promise 
of fulfillment and happiness. Instead, it leaves you feeling guilty, frustrated, 
and possibly even miserable. It’s an unattainable ideal. When we realize that, 
despair is inevitable, but we have nowhere to turn.

222
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
The ethical life is too full of pride
The last problem with the ethical stage connects with the next stage, the 
religious. According to the ethical life, self-fulfillment and wholeness, even if 
difficult to achieve, are always ultimately in the hands of the person. In other 
words, you can be a self simply through your own power — through self-
discipline. If you read what we say earlier in the chapter, however, Kierkegaard 
believes that being a self is a task that we need to take seriously (which the 
aesthetic life fails to do), but at the same time we must realize that we do not, 
on our own, have the ability to complete the task. Instead, for that we must 
turn to God. Seen in this light, the ethical life contains too much hubris. It’s 
stubbornly prideful about the role of the self in its own creation, a pride that 
ultimately leads to despair.
Fear and Trembling: Embracing 
the Religious Life
Kierkegaard clearly thinks the task of being a self isn’t easy. He identifies 
various ways in which you can fail at the task and end up in what he calls 
despair. He also identifies different life stages that people can wind up in and 
that exemplify despair.
Does Kierkegaard think you should be unethical?
Much as Kierkegaard criticizes the ethical life, 
he’s not telling you to seek to be unethical or bad.
To start, keep in mind that Kierkegaard doesn’t 
say that you should, in moving past the aesthetic 
stage’s unhealthy attachment to experiences, 
reject those kinds of connections to the world. 
Rather, he’s saying that you shouldn’t define your-
self and your life in terms of those experiences. 
Essentially, it’s okay to have aesthetic tastes or 
to flavor your life with a variety of pleasurable 
or intense experiences. You simply can’t make 
aesthetic experience a false idol, something you 
bow down to as though it were God, allowing it to 
determine the meaning of life.
Similarly, you shouldn’t strive to move to the 
woods and avoid social life and ethics. Of 
course being a mom or a friend or a colleague 
is important. Kierkegaard just thinks that the 
ethical life doesn’t define you or give you sig-
nificance. Just as much as the aesthetic life 
shouldn’t become a false idol, the ethical life 
shouldn’t become one either, because it’s not 
your final aim or purpose or meaning. So again, 
go cultivate those ethical bonds. But remember 
that you are more.
In short, it may be the case that you can and 
should add ethical (and aesthetic) elements to 
your life. But don’t make the mistake of thinking 
that the aesthetic or the ethical exhaust what 
you are. You’re much more than either one, 
separately or taken together.

223
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
At this point, we make the turn to the final and ultimate stage, the religious. 
Only when a person enters this stage is Kierkegaard willing to say that she’s 
finally succeeded in becoming a self (even if she’ll have to keep at it).
Consistent with the basic tenets of existentialism, Kierkegaard thinks that 
in this stage a person truly embraces all the aspects of what she truly is and 
thus lives an authentic life. That means embracing, through a leap of faith, 
the fundamental absurdity of existence. For Kierkegaard, embracing this fun-
damental absurdity can be truly accomplished only through a leap of faith 
into the religious life.
Whereas the aesthetic stage privileges feelings and the ethical privileges 
reason, the religious favors faith. Theology often struggles in the attempt to 
understand faith. What is it? Kierkegaard turns to the Bible to help figure out 
an answer, specifically to what is often taken to be the ultimate story of faith: 
the saga of Abraham and Isaac. Kierkegaard thinks that this story hides the 
answer to two related questions: “What is faith?” and “What does it mean to 
be a self?” An analysis of that story brings us a bit closer to our answer.
The strange story of Abraham and Isaac
Imagine that one day, you’re tending to your job programming computers, 
executing stock trade orders on Wall Street, or just reading a For Dummies 
book. Everything in your life is going just fine. You have a spouse and a son, 
and you love them both very much. You enjoy your job, and you’re a happy 
member of the community in which you live. You try your best to live a very 
moral life, and you contribute often to the poor. You attend church regularly 
and consider yourself to be very religious. And then one day, something very 
odd happens.
You hear what you take to be the voice of God. No one else can hear it, just 
you. In a way, this isn’t odd — you’ve spoken with God before. But this time 
the voice disturbs you because it tells you to go home and sacrifice your son 
to it. What would you do?
Of course, as the story tells us, Abraham does as he was ordered, though God 
sends an angel to stop Abraham at the last second — as he draws down the 
knife on his son Isaac. Consequently, for passing the test with flying colors, 
Abraham is understood to be the father of faith.
Kierkegaard wants to know what it means to say that Abraham is the father 
of faith. This is important, because the way in which Abraham engages with 
his existence is what you have to pull off to become a self for Kierkegaard 
(no, you won’t have to sacrifice anyone . . . well, at least not necessarily). 

224
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
For Kierkegaard, the movement of faith is the final link, the final piece in 
the puzzle that you’ve been missing all this time. Authenticity isn’t gained 
through feeling, or through reason; it’s attained through faith.
Giving up the earthly: Killing your son
Kierkegaard thinks that an important part of Christianity — or of being a self — 
is being willing to give up the world. What this means is that you shouldn’t 
think that what gives your life meaning can be found within the world. 
Instead, Kierkegaard thinks that life’s meaning is found in a relationship with 
God. This doesn’t mean removing yourself from the world, however. It means 
loving the world passionately while renouncing it for the sake of God. That’s 
the first step!
Kierkegaard doesn’t deny that you exist within the world and that as a 
result, you have earthly or worldly attachments. As the same time, given that 
Kierkegaard thinks being a self means keeping what’s fixed (or finite) and 
what’s possible (or infinite) about you in tension, seeing your significance 
as located solely in the world ignores one important aspect of your self: that 
what you are always transcends what’s given in your worldly experience.
 
One way of being overly attached to the world is seen in the aesthetic life, 
where you see the significance of life in they way you’re affected by things. 
As some aesthetes have it, pleasure is king. Kierkegaard doesn’t want you to 
become lost in those experiences, because they become idolatrous, which 
means mistaking the wrong thing for God (or for what’s ultimately significant). 
In the case of the aesthetic, when your experiences become your “God,” you 
have a problem. Instead, you need to be connected to the world in a healthy 
way that recognizes its importance but subjugates it to what’s superior.
Abraham: Father of faith
The story of Abraham is an early one in the 
Bible, told in the book of Genesis. Although 
the story is a central one to Christianity, it also 
functions prominently with the Jewish and 
Muslim traditions. As the story goes, Abraham, 
who was an old man, entered into a covenant or 
agreement with God. In return for Abraham’s 
devotion to God, God made him a promise — that 
he would be the father of countless generations 
of people on earth. The promise was understood 
in a specific way: Abraham (who was actually 
pretty old at the time) and his wife, Sarah, would 
have a son, Isaac, and Isaac would be the line 
through which that promise would be fulfilled. 
Although Sarah was very old at the time of the 
promise, it came true; she got pregnant and 
gave birth to Isaac. Years later came this story: 
God demanded that Isaac be sacrificed as proof 
of Abraham’s faith.

225
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
This viewpoint can help you understand why God asked Abraham to sacrifice 
his son. After all, Isaac represents the object in the world that Abraham is most 
attached to. God doesn’t oppose Abraham’s love for Isaac (or the experience 
of happiness that it yields for him). He just doesn’t want Isaac to become an 
idol that replaces him. What Abraham really is as a self (his relation to God) 
transcends the world, so he must be prepared to separate himself from his 
attachments to the earthly in a way that demonstrates a recognition of that 
true nature.
Embracing the God who’s beyond ethics
Abraham is in a serious pickle; he has to sacrifice his kid! Put yourself in his 
shoes. What’s he thinking after he hears that voice? What would you think if 
you heard that voice? Of the many ways to respond to this dilemma, two spe-
cifically would rule Abraham out as the father of faith.
One way is to simply deny that it’s the voice of God. If the voice persists, you 
go to see a psychiatrist and ask to be put on medication. A second way is to 
acknowledge that the voice is God’s, but to deny that God is telling the truth. 
Both responses have a similar foundation; they refuse to accept that God 
would ever ask you to do something that seemed so vicious and evil and for 
no apparent greater good.
By thinking in these ways, you reveal that your relationship to God is medi-
ated through an idea of God that you have. This doesn’t mean you know 
everything about God, but it means that you do know at least some things, 
such as the fact that God doesn’t command anyone to do evil.
 
This is a common way of understanding God. But think about it. Doesn’t this 
mean that you are dictating that your God relationship be conducted on your 
terms? Isn’t part of this your claim that God must conform to your conception — 
funneled through reason — of what the good is? Really, you’re demanding 
that God be subordinate to ethics, subordinate to your idea (or your society’s 
idea) about how actions should be performed in the world. You’re really using 
reason to understand God. This creates a second idol (next to Isaac, in this 
case) to worship: the ethical.
But if God transcends the world, why should he be constrained by ethics? 
Isn’t suggesting that God must fit into a preconceived notion of what the 
divine is awfully presumptuous? If you think about it, you can see a lot of 
hubris in this view. Hubris comes from ancient Greek, and it means something 
like exaggerated self-confidence. In ancient Greek tragedies, characters who 
are hubristic all but inevitably get into deep trouble. In this case, thinking in 
these ways would be pretty hubristic!

226
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
If Abraham understands the voice from this hubris-based perspective, you 
can’t find much faith in him at all. If he refuses to sacrifice Isaac because 
what the voice says makes him think that it’s not God, he’s lost his faith and 
found an idol: worldly ethics. If he’s on the way up the mountain but just 
going through the motions — because he knows God is putting him on — 
then he has no faith either, for the same reason! On the other hand, if God is 
above ethics, he’ll have to look at the situation in a whole new way.
Experiencing ethics as a temptation
Usually, sin is understood as the turning away from virtue. So we typically 
say that sinning is the performance of actions that are ethically unsound or 
vicious. But Kierkegaard doesn’t think of sin as a failure of virtue. He sees sin 
as a turn from God. Because God transcends ethics, it must be possible that 
in a certain situation, sin may turn out to be not turning away from virtue, but 
being tempted toward it!
Kierkegaard’s new way of thinking about the God relationship shakes up peo-
ple’s intuitions, because most Christians think that being a good Christian is 
synonymous with being a good person. Because being a good person means 
aligning yourself with the ethical structures that govern the human commu-
nity, being a good Christian means playing your proper social role in just the 
right way. Good Christians tell the truth, they’re kind to others, they’re gener-
ous, they’re kind and caring parents, and they feed the poor.
Clearly, by this view, sin means giving in to the individual desires that you 
have that are opposed to those of the ethical community. Thus, to sin is 
to defiantly assert that you’re meaningful and significant apart from ethics 
(apart from society or the Universal). Thus, Christianity interprets sinning as 
acting selfishly, of ignoring the larger whole.
With Kierkegaard’s view of sin in your pocket, rethink Abraham’s situation. If 
he’s called by God to kill his son, his possible sin isn’t to be pulled away from 
ethics to do something those ethics reject. Instead, because for Kierkegaard 
sin is always primarily a rejection of God, Abraham’s sin in this case is giving 
in to the temptation toward ethics. Clearly, ethics demands that a father not 
kill his son; it’s not virtuous. So here, ethics and virtue tempt you away from 
God. The result is clear: In Kierkegaard’s view, ethics and sin can be in opposition.
 
According to Kierkegaard, God’s command, if Abraham hears it right, forces 
him to recognize that his relationship to God is independent of ethics (the 
world). When someone stands in relationship to God, it’s not as an individual 
within the ethical; it’s as an individual standing above the Universal, alone. 
Ethics isn’t the medium through which you have a relationship with God. In a 
relationship between you and God, ethics is a fifth wheel.
If Abraham hears the voice of God correctly, he understands that in his 
relationship to God, he (Abraham) and God are outside, and higher than, the 

227
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
Universal. Abraham realizes that he shouldn’t reject ethics entirely, but he should 
learn to perform what Kierkegaard calls a suspension of the ethical when God calls 
for it, because only in God does Abraham find his true significance and meaning.
 
If God transcend ethics, God quite possibly does want you to kill your son (or 
mother) and will follow through on the request. If you can accept that, and 
embrace that kind of relationship with God and with the world, Kierkegaard 
thinks you’re starting to get somewhere. Abraham has to see himself as an 
exceptional individual, one who must strive to see the foundation of his own 
existence as, to use Nietzsche’s phrase, beyond good and evil.
Renouncing your worldly self
A faithful Abraham believes that God will take Isaac from him. He has to be 
bummed about it. But Abraham could kill Isaac and see it as something any 
good person would have to do in his position. But true faith, Kierkegaard 
argues, means Abraham must sacrifice the possibility of finding any comfort 
in what he does. He must not have a worldly way of rationalizing his murder 
of his son to make it more understandable. He must sacrifice even this kind 
of connection to the world.
Missing what Kierkegaard means is easy to do. To help clarify, look at the 
ancient Greek story of Agamemnon. Agamemnon is the king of Mycenae, and 
his country is at war with Troy. To fulfill his duties as a king, Agamemnon 
has to sail his fleet to Troy. But he has a problem. Some of the gods have 
demanded that he murder his daughter, Iphigenia, to provide the wind 
needed to get his ships there.
Agamemnon’s in a pickle. Ethics makes two demands on him, each motivated 
by different parts of his worldly identity as a king and as a father. One role 
demands a sacrifice; the other role prohibits it. These tragic dilemmas were 
common in Greek plays of the time, typically dealing with clashes of duties 
like the one Agamemnon faces. In a tragic dilemma, there’s no way out; either 
way you turn, you do something wrong to do something right.
Agamemnon does kill his daughter (don’t worry — his wife kills him later 
when he gets back from Troy). Like Abraham, Agamemnon has to give up or 
sacrifice the worldly thing that he loves most: his daughter. He must make 
this sacrifice to affirm his more important ethical relationship to his people 
as a king.
 
That’s where the similarities with Abraham end. Agamemnon sacrifices his 
daughter, but he doesn’t have to give up his worldly identity as well because 
his action makes sense in terms of worldly ethics. According to the ethical 
structures governing Agamemnon’s world, his daughter’s murder was required 
of him as a king, so it actually served the greater ethical good.

228
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Although he’s unhappy, Agamemnon can resign himself to the loss of his 
daughter because it was demanded of him by the Universal. He acts in a 
ghastly fashion, but not immorally. So Agamemnon — and those around him — 
can rest on his worldly conception of what he’s done to understand it. People 
can pity Agamemnon and be glad that they’ve never been called to do some-
thing similar.
Abraham can’t rest on world ethics, and that’s why his situation calls for 
more than just a sacrifice of a child. Unlike Agamemnon’s, Abraham’s tempta-
tion doesn’t come from within the ethical realm (in Agamemnon’s case, the 
temptation is to act as father). Thus Abraham has no worldly self to whom he 
can turn to justify what he’s doing. When Abraham acts, he leaves his social 
and ethical world entirely behind him.
As a result, Abraham embraces his choice as one that can’t be understood 
or justified within the world. In terms of the world, Abraham is a murderer. 
Thus, in terms of his worldly self, Abraham can’t comfort himself at all. He 
must simply do it because he’s chosen to heed God’s call. Essentially, he’s 
prepared to sacrifice his own worldly self as well as the life of his son. It’s 
also worth noting that for Abraham, his son is his immortality. There’s no 
Christian afterlife. So this really is a big sacrifice!
This is pretty devastating. Abraham has no safe harbor, no excuse to use. 
He stands before his relationship with God in fear and trembling. He must 
choose as an individual alone.
Faith and Kierkegaard’s love life
Philosophers in general have had a pretty sorry 
relationship with love. In fact, Nietzsche (who 
had serious issues in this area too) joked that 
the married philosopher “belonged in comedy.” 
Kierkegaard was no exception, but his story is 
a famous one.
Early in his life, he became enamored with a 
young girl named Regina Olsen. The couple 
became engaged, but after a short time, 
Kierkegaard broke off the engagement. One 
reason was that Kierkegaard wasn’t sure he 
could do God’s work — his writing, and trying 
to wake people up to authentic life — and be 
married at the same time. To him, it seemed 
like an either/or choice; he had to choose one. 
It was a decision that haunted Kierkegaard for 
the rest of his life.
Many think that within Kierkegaard’s discus-
sion of the Abraham story is the story of his 
own tortured relationship. He felt that he had 
been called upon to sacrifice (luckily, not liter-
ally) Regina for God. He waited all his life hoping 
to get Regina back, as Abraham got Isaac back, 
but it never happened. She, unlike him, moved 
on and married another man.

229
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
Believing the impossible: The knight of faith
Abraham is resigned to the fact that God will take Isaac from him. But if that’s 
where the story ends, Abraham is just a resigned guy, not particularly happy. 
However, he also believes, Kierkegaard argues, that he’ll get Isaac back again. 
He seemingly believes the impossible! That requires faith. It’s his faith that 
allows him to be happy as he travels to the mountain.
Abraham is resigned to the fact that he’s going to lose Isaac. He knows that 
it’s not a game and that God isn’t messing around. As a result, Kierkegaard 
says that Abraham makes the “movement of infinite resignation.” He’s sac-
rificed the world for God. But can you be resigned to losing the world and 
also believe that you’ll get it back? If Abraham is actually thinking this, he’s 
really grasping onto something that doesn’t make any sense at all; Abraham 
is embracing the absurd.
With God’s help, Abraham finally holds together what’s fixed and what’s pos-
sible in his action. He’s resigned to the loss of Isaac and the world (the fixed) 
but also hopeful that he’ll get Isaac back (the possible). It’s an absurdity, but 
that’s what’s needed to live as a true self, to open yourself to the mystery 
that in God all things are possible. Thus Abraham ceases to try to force exis-
tence to make sense. Instead, he opens himself to the mystery of the divine.
Why faith must be offensive
Although many existentialists weren’t religious, for Kierkegaard, the great-
est way of living in truth was to embody the life that contained the greatest 
passion — and to do that required faith. For Kierkegaard, this makes sense: 
Living passionately means making a commitment to a life that’s full of risk 
and mystery, like Abraham’s, one that requires real courage to will. As it 
turns out, for Kierkegaard Christianity is the greatest passion.
If you make a commitment to being a good person, you can never entirely 
explain why you made that commitment in terms of reasons and evidence. 
Even if you claim to have reasons, those reasons themselves require reasons. 
At some point, you need to make a commitment to this way of life through a 
leap. Because the leap itself lacks reasons, it requires risk and embraces mys-
tery. Leaping into life embodies passion.
Even if reason can’t tell you that being a good person is best, choosing this 
path surely isn’t offensive to reason. The problem is just that at some point, 
reason has to say, “I don’t know.” As a result, for Kierkegaard the ethical life 
doesn’t embody the ultimate degree of risk and mystery that a person can 
take on. Instead, he takes the Christian requirement of belief in Jesus to raise 
the anxiety that comes with passionate choice to a fever pitch. He calls this 
ideal the absolute paradox. Reason isn’t indifferent to the absolute paradox; 
it’s offended by it.

230
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
Kierkegaard has a point, doesn’t he? Imagine the Christian who stakes her 
existence on a belief in Jesus as the son of God. If her ideal is correct, God, 
who’s eternal, actually became man and made himself temporal and finite. 
What is wholly transcendent and sacred (God) became profane and ordinary 
(man). Jesus is the living embodiment of a contradiction!
Unlike belief in goodness, belief in the incarnation of Jesus is an outright 
rejection of reason. Reason doesn’t want to reject ethics, but according to 
Kierkegaard it does want to reject the Incarnation. The absolute paradox 
doesn’t just lack reasons to embrace it; there can’t be any reasons, because it 
makes no sense.
 
Here, in the realm of the absurd, you find infinite passion. As Kierkegaard puts 
it, “The supreme paradox of all thought is the attempt to discover something 
that thought cannot think.” In the Incarnation, it has found just that paradox. 
Kierkegaard says that faith requires that you “. . . remain out upon the deep, 
over seventy thousand fathoms of water, still preserving my faith.” The deep, 
of course, is the absurd. It’s as though what Kierkegaard wants us to do is 
walk out over an empty abyss, with no foundation beneath us to give us secu-
rity, and travel from one question mark about existence to the next, in a pas-
sionate and committed way.
Kierkegaard is suggesting that committing to Christ means shattering the use 
of reason as the way to forge a relationship with your own existence. To truly 
exist, and so to live in total truth, you must embrace the absurd. Although 
Abraham lived before Christ, he too forged a relationship with the absurd. 
He committed to a sacrifice while believing that what was sacrificed would 
be restored to him. Neither belief rules out the other; it’s paradox that’s kept 
alive by willing both with equal force. That’s faith.
Proving that God exists
What would Kierkegaard have thought about 
the contemporary fuss over intelligent design — 
the claim that the complexity of life on earth is 
explained by pointing to the guiding hand of an 
intelligent designer — and evolution, which sug-
gests that this complexity can be explained by 
using merely natural forces?
Although Kierkegaard lived before Darwin 
and wasn’t exposed to evolutionary theory, 
he was dismissive of intelligent-design theo-
ries because he rejected the need to point to 
evidence for God. For Kierkegaard, a person’s 
need for objective proofs of God is a clear sign 
that the person’s faith is lost. To strive to place 
a rational foundation under your faith removes 
the demand for inwardly grappling with the 
paradox of living religiously. Kierkegaard was 
also dismissive of a trend toward using his-
torical evidence to prove Jesus’s validity. He 
believed these attempts demean faith and have 
a common goal: relieving the task of taking 
responsibility for your faith and placing it on 
something external, like reason and intellectual 
analysis.

231
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
Here’s where people need God’s help. Abraham must kneel before God and 
submit to God for help in achieving this movement. In doing so, he’ll become 
himself. He must humbly ask for God’s grace.
Why Abraham is an existential hero
Why is Abraham an existential hero? What Abraham does, in essence, is 
learn to live the life that all existentialists think you should embrace. For all 
existentialists, living authentically means one thing: embracing the absurdity 
of your existence (check out Chapter 5 for more on that). You shouldn’t shy 
away from that role; you should joyfully embrace it.
 
Surely Abraham embraces absurdity by being willing to sacrifice his son and 
believing that his son will be restored to him. But Abraham’s existential journey 
continues long after he leaves Mount Moriah. You may expect that afterward, 
Abraham would never be able to reconnect with his world again. He would find 
no passion in his relationship with his son, and he would from that point think of 
his social roles, and the ethical rules that structure them, as totally meaningless. 
A lot of people would expect, quite naturally, that Abraham’s situation would 
ruin him by turning him into an angry, disgruntled person.
But if Abraham continues to be a knight of faith, this can’t happen. Instead, 
Abraham must love his son with the same passion that he did before he 
renounced him. And he must embrace his social and ethical world with as 
much vigor as he did before. But he must do this while recognizing that the 
significance of his life doesn’t lie here, because he transcends the world in 
his relationship with God.
Abraham doesn’t return to the world and accept it in the way that a person 
might accept a broken gift. Instead, Abraham joyfully rejoins the human com-
munity. This is the central existential dilemma: trying to figure out how to 
exist in a world without ultimate meaning while engaging with it passionately 
(you might find an interesting analogue here with the story of Sisyphus in 
Chapter 5). How do you live in a world that you know you transcend but still 
live in it meaningfully? For Abraham, or for you, the way you do it can’t make 
sense, and that’s why it’s absurd. But everyone has that task before her — 
one that, according to Kierkegaard, you can accomplish only with God’s help.
The problem with contemporary 
Christians: They lack faith
As an existentialist and as a Christian, Kierkegaard is concerned about your 
relationship with existence and, hence, with God. From his point of view, 
however, the problem isn’t that people strive to be like Abraham but fail. 

232
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Instead, Christians in today’s age don’t even bother to try. Kierkegaard felt 
that modern Christianity was watered down by the church, so the question of 
grappling with existence just doesn’t arise anymore. It’s taken a backseat to 
other (most likely aesthetic) pursuits.
Kierkegaard’s beef with the church is based on his distaste for attempts to 
make Christianity palpable or rational and so more digestible to the crowd. In 
the end, Christianity winds up being used as a way of giving the social rituals 
of everyday life a larger context. Christianity becomes less about an anxiety-
laden individual’s commitment to God and more about being a good hus-
band, or a good business partner, or a regular churchgoer. Religion becomes 
about what you do, as opposed to a way in which you’re engaged with your 
existence. As a result, in Kierkegaard’s view, religion is made common. 
Kierkegaard starts by distinguishing two things:
 
 Christendom: The modern descendant of Christianity
 
 New Testament: The actual way of life required of Christians as 
Kierkegaard sees it outlined in the Bible
Christendom, as a term, gives the impression of a state or an empire — but 
not a religion. This is Kierkegaard’s point. In 19th-century Denmark, citizens 
were members of the state church, which was Christian, so Denmark was 
effectively a Christian state and society. Kierkegaard’s worry, however, is 
that making Christianity into a social or political institution is contrary to its 
real New Testament aim: for the individual to forge a relationship with God. 
The two simply don’t work together.
The need to give up the world
To live as a New Testament Christian, Kierkegaard thinks you must acknowl-
edge your fundamental separation from the world. Being a true Christian 
means rubbing up against the world and living in a perpetual state of worldly 
friction. Because Christians are supposed to be at odds with the world, you 
must, as Nietzsche might say, live dangerously. As Kierkegaard sees it, the early 
Christians always saw themselves as outside the world, society, and politics. 
They saw that their true place was with God and not with the earthly.
 
As Kierkegaard sees it, Christendom is different. In modern Denmark, living 
well within the world requires that you be a Christian. In 19th-century 
Denmark, everyone was a Christian. To get along in society, you couldn’t 
buck the crowd — and the crowd was Christian. The success of Christianity 
has become its greatest threat; when everyone is Christian, no one is truly 
Christian because the word doesn’t mean anything anymore.
To Kierkegaard, Christianity has ceased to be religion and started to look 
more like a country-club membership that you need if you want to succeed 
or live well in a particular society. He has a strong point. In heavily Christian 

233
 Chapter 10: Kierkegaard: The Task of Being a Religious Existentialist
communities, being Christian is important if you don’t want to be ostracized or 
seen as weird. Businesses pride themselves on being run by good Christians 
to drum up better business. In some communities, you’ll have a hard time 
getting married if you aren’t Christian. No one’s parents would allow themselves 
to be known by the crowd as the people who allowed such an unacceptable 
thing to happen.
 
As Kierkegaard laments, in modern times the typical person “. . . is also 
a Christian, goes to church every Sunday, listens to and understands the 
pastor, yes indeed they understand one another; he dies, for ten dollars the 
pastor ushers him into eternity — but a self he neither was, nor became.” 
Kierkegaard’s description of the life of the typical Christian sounds stale and 
meaningless, doesn’t it? That’s Kierkegaard’s point. Sure, most people attend 
church regularly. What for? Mostly to keep up appearances, to remind their 
social peers that they’re still one of them — a socially acceptable person.
The meaning of Christianity has long since been lost. As Abraham’s story 
shows, your relationship with God isn’t found in your involvement with the 
world. A true Christian grapples with the individualistic question of what it 
means, for the individual, to exist and what it means to be Christian. Because 
the church itself is too heavily invested in the business of the world, it’s 
focused on expanding its own membership. So it knows better than to make 
Christianity about anything that forces people to grapple with difficult subjects 
or topics or to prepare people to see themselves as separate from the world.
Dostoyevsky’s existentialism: 
“The Grand Inquisitor”
A brilliantly written story called “The Grand 
Inquisitor” (part of a longer novel called The 
Brothers Karamazov, 1880) was written by 
Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky and has a 
similar theme to Kierkegaard’s anti-Christendom 
message. In “The Grand Inquisitor,” Dostoyevsky 
tells the story of how Jesus gets arrested by the 
Spanish Inquisition upon his return to the world. 
The bulk of the story is the Grand Inquisitor 
explaining to Jesus why he has been arrested. 
The Inquisitor tells him that he’s protecting 
the people from Jesus, that they aren’t strong 
enough to handle the freedom to grapple with 
and choose the right path that Jesus wants 
to offer them. Instead, the Inquisitor says this 
path leads to nothing but unhappiness and 
misery for people. If people want happiness, 
they need security and comfort. People need to 
be told what’s good and evil by the authorities. 
They need to be given clear rules and rituals to 
follow that allow them to be not only free of the 
anxiety of choice, but also comfortable in their 
lives and happy through the stable and under-
standable life that the church provides them. The 
Inquisitor’s way of framing the situation mirrors 
Kierkegaard’s worry that the interests of the 
church and the interests of the individual aren’t 
the same. For Kierkegaard and the Inquisitor, the 
question is an either/or choice: Is it Jesus’s way, 
or is it the church’s way?

234
Part III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Life isn’t meant to be easy
 
Authentic, true living shouldn’t be easy, Kierkegaard thinks. Cultivating a dis-
tance from the worldly things that typically make you happy is bound to cause 
you to reach for the aspirin bottle pretty often. As far as Kierkegaard sees it, 
the spiritual man of the New Testament understands this and embraces what’s 
uncomfortable, unreasonable, or offensive about Christianity (and life).
Kierkegaard thinks most religious people don’t fit this description. Instead, 
Christianity gets reinterpreted by organized religion so that it authorizes 
how people already want to live. The church doesn’t calls for sacrifices any-
more — other than the occasional $10 tossed into the offering basket. The 
life of Christianity within the church is passionless. No commitment. No risk. 
No fear. Faith is simple and easy. Just live your normal, socially acceptable, 
happy life, and the Christian part of your life follows along for free. Nothing 
needs to be difficult, because God wants you to be happy! From Kierkegaard’s 
perspective, when faith and following Christ get easy, something’s rotten in 
Denmark — pun intended!

E
xistentialists stress the importance of living in accord with who you are. 
So who are you? For one, you’re the kind of being who’s irreducibly indi-
vidual. Every person has a particularity that’s unique to him and that can’t 
be understood by turning to meanings and values that are external to him. 
Because you’re individual in this way, only you can give a proper expression 
of your own meaning. Existing as an individual requires that the purpose you 
give to your life reflect your individuality.
Because your experiences of the world and of yourself change, however, your 
unique individuality is always undergoing alteration. As a result, existing as 
an individual means always challenging the meaning you give to your life 
to ensure that it continues over time to honestly serve as an expression of 
your uniqueness. A lot of people have a difficult time living up to these tasks. 
Many times they give in to weakness and define their lives in terms of values 
exterior to them. Sometimes they reject the need to continually reassess the 
meaning they’ve given their lives by holding onto a fixed idea of themselves.
Living as an individual means embodying the path of a warrior. You must 
resist the values of the crowd by taking individual responsibility for creating 
your identity, and you must perpetually put that identity at risk by subjecting 
it to constant challenges.
In this chapter, we explain how Nietzsche views the self and why he thinks 
that living as an individual means giving your life a goal or meaning that’s 
always in a state of flux or change. We discuss Nietzsche’s archetype of 

236
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
individual authentic living, the noble, and we highlight what it means to live 
life in a noble fashion. We then discuss how the noble person seeks to create 
an individual meaning, direction or goal for his own life, one that he seeks to 
artistically express and cultivate by avoiding dogma and instead by seeking 
to increase the number of diverse perspectives on that goal. Such a pursuit 
means putting your own idea of who you are (your goals) under constant 
threat, which reveals Nietzsche’s belief that a noble self meets the challenges 
that individual life entails, including the suggestion that noble living embraces 
the task of living dangerously by developing its own self in a way that puts the 
survival of that very self in continual danger and at risk of coming apart.
We round out the discussion by also highlighting Nietzsche’s archetype of 
failed individual living — the slave. As we highlight, slaves and nobles do not 
merely differ in how they actually approach life but are also differentiated by 
the kinds of emotions that characterize their existence. Whereas the noble 
is dominated by a consciousness of self-love, the slave is overwhelmed by 
hatred, an emotion that produces a kind of resentment that Nietzsche sees 
in modern Christianity and that he thinks leads to the slave’s rejection of 
individual living in favor of various strategies of self-deception. We finish the 
chapter by presenting a more passive way to fail to be individual — to suc-
cumb to the weaknesses of herd mentality, or to give in to the temptation to 
live in sheer conformity to what the crowd or the masses dictate.
Investigating Who You Are
According to the existentialist, your self is always changing. On one level, 
this seems an odd thing to say; don’t you feel that there’s a “you” that’s sur-
vived all the changes your personality has gone though? Nietzsche, for one, 
doesn’t disagree that it feels that way, but he thinks that it’s a deceptive way 
of understanding what it means to be self.
In fact, Nietzsche thinks that behind that feeling of unified selfhood is 
the true you — a battlefield filled with hostile and competing psychologi-
cal forces called desires (these are drives, character traits, instincts, or 
impulses). At any point in time, some stronger desires are dominating weaker 
ones. As a result, a hierarchy of desires forms that results in what you take to 
be your perspective on the world, or the way things look and feel from your 
point of view.
Nietzsche’s view of the self leads to three central points:
 
 Being composed of desires, your self is always biased. You can’t help 
but project meaning or value onto the world.

237
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
 
 Because changing experiences means developing different desires, the 
question of who you are is always an open one.
 
 Although you are, at any moment, a given perspective, you’re never 
reducible to that perspective. Your identity is never fixed; new perspectives 
are always possible for you.
You can take charge of who you are
 
Underscoring the mystery of the self, Nietzsche says, “We are unknown to 
ourselves, we men of knowledge — and with good reason. We have never 
sought ourselves — how could it happen that we should ever find ourselves?” 
Commonly, we take our perspective, or our way of engaging with the world, 
as integral to our sense of our identity. If engaging the world as an individual 
is important, this would imply that you need to know what it would mean to 
have a perspective or identity that expresses your individuality.
Imagine that elements of your perspective were grafted into you by society. 
In fact, society may want you to uncritically accept certain ways of seeing 
things. If you do that, you’re engaging with the world in ways created by 
others. Are you willing to call this perspective an expression of what you are 
as a unique individual?
Well, let’s face it — you’d look like a robot programmed to perform a societal 
function. Society isn’t the only thing that can get in the way of individuality in 
this way. Sometimes people deceive themselves into seeing things in ways 
that will cause them less pain, showing a key Nietzschean point: Being an 
individual and happiness aren’t necessarily correlated. It’s also a sad truth, 
but some people value feeling good over living as a unique individual. Nietzsche 
would probably see such cases as examples of the slang phrase selling out.
One thing is clear: If your way of engaging with the world isn’t an expres-
sion of your own unique individuality, you’re not in control of your own life. 
Knowing when you’ve been deceived is important, so living as an individual 
begins with understanding yourself, which Nietzsche suggests in the earlier 
quote we’re not terribly good at.
 
Living as an individual requires the following:
 
 Engaging with the world in a way that expresses your unique self
 
 Living self-critically to control elements of your self that aren’t reflective 
of you
 
 Being honest about the self at all times and avoiding deceptions

238
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
You’re a sea of desire
Nietzsche wants to advance a new interpretation of what you are. He rejects 
the notion that there’s a fixed “you” and suggests instead that you talk about 
the self as composed of a multiplicity or diversity of different desires. If that’s 
right, you change all the time because your desires alter as you go through 
new, different experiences.
Something feels right about this concept. I don’t feel in any way like the same 
person who occupied my body at 15, or 20, or 30, or 40 (all right, coauthor 
Chris is over 40!). What accounts for the difference? Well, your perspective 
on the world changes over time, and that’s because the desires that compose 
your perspective have changed.
Nietzsche thinks that
 
 The self is composed of desires, and these always change.
 
 Those desires compose your perspective or point of view, or your way 
of engaging with the world.
 
 Your desires are always changing, so your perspective is always in flux.
 
Like the 18th century philosopher David Hume, Nietzsche feels that if you 
tried to introspect into yourself and follow a point of view or desire backward, 
you’d never find a mysterious self or “I” hiding out behind the scenes. Both of 
them feel this way because they’re convinced that a unified “I” behind your 
desires doesn’t exist. As a result, Nietzsche thinks that being an individual 
demands taking account of the fact that who you are is always undergoing 
alteration and change. As a result, being an individual can never attempt to 
express a fixed or timeless self.
Heraclitus’s river
Heraclitus was a pre-Socratic philosopher who 
lived in Greece around 500 BC. He is known 
as the philosopher of becoming because he 
thought that the basic nature of reality was 
change. Everything, Heraclitus argued, was in 
a constant state of flux or alteration. Nothing 
was fixed, and the appearance of stability 
was really an illusion. As an example, because 
the exact water in a river is never the same, 
Heraclitus believed that you could never step 
into the same river twice. One of Heraclitus’s 
philosophical opponents, Parmenides, argued 
the opposite: He denied that anything changed 
and said that the appearance of change was 
an illusion. He was a philosopher of being, 
and he felt that all reality was one fixed thing. 
Nietzsche sides with Heraclitus, and he incor-
porates beliefs about becoming into his own 
way of talking about the self.

239
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
You’re biased: You can’t 
help it; it’s just you!
Today’s culture thinks that if you try hard enough, you can escape your own 
biases and achieve objective or unbiased interpretations about the world. 
Nietzsche’s claim that your identity is really a collection of desires conflicts 
with this because desires are inherently biased by definition.
In typical existentialist fashion, Nietzsche rejects the notion of a right way 
to see things. He sees no objective truth in the world for you to discover. 
Instead, he thinks you must understand the world through your perspective, 
one that always reflects your own specific interests.
 
Nietzsche puts it this way, “No, facts are precisely what there are not; only 
interpretations.” Nietzsche surely doesn’t think that this is bad; it’s natural. 
Knowing who you are as a self requires embracing this fact. Nietzsche’s view 
is called perspectivism, the view that all descriptions of the world are given 
from a biased or self-interested point of view.
In fact, even science and philosophy, Nietzsche thinks, inherently represent 
the interests of its practitioners; the belief that objective science or pure 
reason reveals the truth of things is a fiction! In fact, although most people 
tend to see science as fact, the existentialists view the truths of science as 
one perspective in the world among others.
You can change: Analyzing the false
belief that you’re a fixed object
One false belief that Nietzsche thinks gets in the way of your goal of living as 
an individual is the claim that you’re a fixed, unchanging object. Still, most 
people feel as though an unchanging, fixed thing lies behind their thoughts 
and feelings and desires. Most people feel that the self is an independent 
thing that has those things. Nietzsche thinks that for us to live in ways that 
are more authentic to what we are, we need to tackle this false belief and the 
further falsities that it leads us to embrace. Here are a few of them:
 
 False belief #1: You don’t change. If your self is just a solitary, unified 
thing, changing beliefs and desires won’t change you. You’d be the same 
all the time, because you’re different from your beliefs and desires; 
you’re the thing underneath them.

240
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
 
 False belief #2: Being a self requires no activity on your part. If you 
don’t change, you can’t cease to be a self (well, unless you die). If that’s 
right, it would be silly to say you have to succeed at being a self or that 
you could do something wrong and suddenly fail to be a self.
 
 False belief #3: You can achieve an objective point of view on the 
world. Being biased always means seeing things from one desire or 
other. But if what you are turns out to be something that’s independent 
of desire, you’re something that’s essentially unbiased and objective.
 
Nietzsche wants to challenge all these false beliefs. For one, he wants to suggest 
that you’re not an unchanging thing. Instead, you have lots of internal parts that 
are always changing and undergoing alteration. Second, those parts have to 
be arranged in just the right way for you to be a self. So being a self requires 
actual activity. Last, the existentialists claim that you’re always biased in how 
you see the world. This is a basic truth of existentialism — that you’re always 
projecting meaning of your own onto the world and that this is just an ines-
capable part of who you are (Camus and Heidegger both make this claim; see 
Chapters 5 and 6, respectively).
You can be fooled by your own language
Nietzsche thinks you have false beliefs about what you are for lots of reasons. 
Maybe society benefits by fooling you into thinking that objectivity is valuable 
and that its way of seeing things is objectively correct. Nietzsche thinks this 
clearly happens, and if you’re going to be an individual, you need to be on 
guard against these kinds of deceptions. But another way in which you can 
fall prey to these false beliefs is more subtle.
Perhaps, Nietzsche says, language fools you: You become seduced by the 
ways you talk. You say things like “I went to the store” or “I desire a steak for 
dinner.” These sentences have an object, the “I,” and an independent action, 
the “went to the store” or “desire a steak” part. This way of talking suggests 
that some unified “I” object does or performs the action and that the self or 
“I” is separate from the activity of desiring or doing.
Use language like this frequently enough, and you’ll start thinking that “I” 
refers to some object that’s separate and independent from desires, wants, or 
actions. You soon start thinking that you’re a fixed thing that doesn’t change, 
that you don’t have to do anything to be a self, and that you’re capable of 
seeing things from an unbiased point of view.
Although language simplifies life, Nietzsche thinks you shouldn’t let useful 
fictions (like the word “I”) affect your way of understanding yourself. It may 
be helpful in society to talk as though you’re a fixed object, but that doesn’t 
mean you are that way. Because language usage leads into deceptions about 

241
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
what you are, you need to be careful not to allow language to affect you in 
your attempts to engage with the world as an individual.
Understanding the Self As 
a Chaos Made Orderly
Existentialism stresses the importance of existing as an individual and so 
emphasizes that individuality requires making fundamental life choices about 
the kind of life you find meaningful. So even if the self truly is a collection of 
desires, you need to learn to structure those desires so that they express 
your choice of life direction.
To understand the importance that choice can play in being an individual, 
you need to understand that each desire, or component of the self, is a 
different way of seeing the world. As a result, all your desires are always in 
competition. This recognition leads to the importance of choice: Being a self 
requires unifying those warring desires under a central purpose or meaning. 
So being a self requires mastering yourself by giving your desires a common 
direction.
This reveals two of Nietzsche’s central points:
 
 The self begins as a kind of chaos of unorganized desire.
 
 Being a self requires the activity of mastering your desires and ordering 
them around a choice that expresses the meaning you’ve given your life.
Getting a handle on your 
unorganized desires
Your self is really a big collection of desires, each of which is aimed at the 
world in a specific way. A desire for pizza is aimed at getting pizza, whereas 
the desire for money is aimed at getting money. To be aimed at the world just 
means to see the world and to be motivated to act within it in terms dictated 
by what the desires point to. Seen in this way, the self turns out to consist in 
many different perspectives all aimed at the same world.
As an example, take courage — the kind of desire that can form a part of what 
you are. Any desire can partly shape your way of being in the world, which 
means that it contributes its unique way of being aimed at the world to your 
point of view or perspective. So when you look out at the world and respond 
to it in terms of emotion or action, courage, if it’s part of you, plays a role in 
how that all happens.

242
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Putting your desires into perspective
Think of each desire as having two components:
 
 The first reveals that the desire has a particular way of seeing the world 
that’s specific to it. Courage literally sees the world in terms of its aim — 
courageous action. If courage is part of you, and you see a child in a 
burning building, you see this as a situation that calls for immediate 
action. In a sense, the desire points to the building and calls attention to 
it, shouting to you, “Hey! Pay attention! Courageous action goes here!”
 
 The second component of desire is that it’s a way of being driven toward 
the world. As a result of having desires, you’re literally pulled toward 
certain things and away from other things. The courageous person literally 
feels pulled toward the building and toward helping. He also feels emotional 
pain if he resists that pull, so being driven includes feeling, which shows 
that being you isn’t just a way of thinking. You’re an embodied entity, so 
you don’t see things, and then feel a certain way and are pulled toward or 
away from things. They all occur at once.
One way to think of this concept is to consider a scenario in which someone 
shows you a picture of an animal that has a combination of both duck and 
rabbit features. To see the picture as a rabbit or as a duck means that you 
have a concept of those things to apply to the world. If you don’t have a con-
cept of a duck, you won’t see the picture as a duck. You can’t. The desires at 
your core work the same way. To experience the world in an X-way, you have 
to have the desire for X. Someone without that X-desire will see it in some 
other way, one according to the specific desires he has.
Now you may be saying to yourself that you have a lot of desires, but it 
always feels as though you have one point of view. How does that work? Well, 
if you’re a collection of desires, that feeling of unity really represents a collec-
tion of desires that have come together in some way.
Embracing internal struggle as essential to you
Inside of your self, a vicious struggle is always under way between the 
desires that compose you. Each desire wants to dominate the rest, to take 
the lead in determining how you engage with the world.
How do warring desires interact? Say that you have a desire (or drive) for 
money and a desire for social acceptability. Now imagine that you’re at a street 
corner, and a little old (wealthy) lady is standing there, terrified to cross the 
street. Your desire for money sees her as a source of possible satisfaction; she 
has lots of money in that purse, and the desire urges you to wallop her with 
a club and rob her. At the same time, you have a desire for social acceptabil-
ity also fighting to have its aim represented in your way of engaging with the 
world. It sees certain things — like clubbing little old ladies — as unpleasant, 
so it pulls at you accordingly. If you have both of these desires, you feel them; 

243
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
you sense a tension in the way that you see the situation, and you feel your 
body pulled to behave in contradictory ways.
 
How do you resolve these inner conflicts? Although desires are always in com-
petition, Nietzsche says, they aren’t all equally powerful. Stronger drives tend 
to dominate weaker ones. If the desire for acceptability is stronger than the 
desire for money, both end up having a place in that person’s perspective, but 
the acceptability desire controls how the money desire gets to express itself. 
In Nietzsche’s language, they fall into an order of rank, with one dominating 
the other.
In this case, that may mean that you agree to help the old woman across the 
street safely, knowing she’ll offer you some money afterward. This way, both 
desires get expressed, but one rules the other (money desires are expressed 
in socially acceptable ways).
Now think about it — that’s just two desires. But you’re a bogglingly large 
number of desires — and they’re all at war! Your way of engaging with the 
world is determined by the way that those internal battles play out.
Striving for selfhood through self-mastery
Everyone knows someone he thinks of as a psychological train wreck. The 
person seems to lack any kind of control over his desires. For Nietzsche, 
being a self requires not being a train wreck. It means that you possess a 
commanding drive that represents a choice about how to unify your warring 
desires under a single goal or purpose. It means giving your self a coherent 
sense of direction through self-mastery.
Maybe when the particular train wreck you know is in a certain situation, one 
desire takes control of him. When he’s in a different situation, some other 
contradictory desire takes control. So in one situation, desire A has control 
of desire B, whereas in a different situation, B controls A. This kind of person 
seems to have no coherence or order within his personality. He seems out of 
control, unpredictable, and unstable — hardly the kind of person you’d want 
to be around!
This kind of person isn’t the picture of what an existential individual looks 
like. Individuals have a sense of direction; they have a goal or purpose that 
unifies their lives. An individual decides that this is how he wants to engage 
with the world, and in making that choice, he rejects other ways of engaging. 
Then he sticks to those decisions. He’s not a flip-flopper. Individuals seem to 
live with a sense of real purpose and direction.

244
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Seen in this way, selfhood looks a lot like an achievement; it’s something that 
you’re always doing. Your stronger desires don’t just tell your weaker desires 
to do something and then watch it happen. Those stronger desires have to 
keep making those weaker desires do what they want. In this way of speaking, 
the self needs a commander. It’s a 24/7 job to keep all your desires in line.
 
Nietzsche thinks of self-mastery as a kind of art. He says, “Only one thing is 
needful; to give style to one’s character — a great and rare art!” In a sense, 
when you strive to be an individual, you are at the same time the artist and the 
mound of clay. You fashion yourself into a sculpture. You look at the desires 
that compose you (the clay) and decide what goal or aim you want to posit 
for your life (what shape you want this clay to take on). This self-formation 
requires choice. You have to decide that the clay should take on some particu-
lar shape as opposed to some other. The self-as-artist then imposes upon his 
desires a sense of style by making them conform to that self-chosen shape. Of 
course, by style Nietzsche doesn’t mean the imposition of some contemporary 
style or fad, but a notion of style as expressive of one’s individual creative and 
aesthetic nature.
For Nietzsche, individuals
 
 See life as a kind of artistic project.
 
 Play the role of artist in creating a goal or shape that their life should take.
 
 Play the role of the clay because they’re also being shaped.
Say that you want to fashion yourself as a studious person. Becoming a doctor 
is important to you, so you give yourself this goal. Well, this means that in dif-
ferent situations, you’re capable of controlling your desires and keeping them 
in line. If you have a videogame console in your room, but you have an exam 
tomorrow, you need to be able to control the desire to play so that it doesn’t 
interfere with your goal of being studious as a person. In fact, true mastery 
means that you’ve trained your desire to get entertainment out of studying! 
That’s how individuals live. They choose, and then they hold themselves 
accountable to their own decisions. If you submit to the videogames each 
time, you’re more of a train wreck, with no real, cohesive sense of self. You’re 
all over the place, with no sense of direction or purpose.
This ability to give style to your own person requires a lot of inner strength. 
Treating yourself as a work of art isn’t easy. Think of it like driving a chariot. 
The strongest charioteer (remember, this means the ruling desire, not a 
nondesire-based self!) can keep all the wild horses driving it pointed forward 
and moving in one direction — the direction that the charioteer wants.

245
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Being an Individual Means Being Noble
Making a firm choice about how to give shape to your life is necessary to live 
as an individual, but being a self still requires more, because the meaning you 
give your life must be unique to you as an individual. To succeed at being 
a self means being noble; you don’t recognize exterior values or meanings, 
such as those coming from institutional religion or societal norms, as having 
an authority over you. So you give yourself a self-created purpose.
 
Nobles truly embrace the existentialists’ claim that value comes into existence 
with you and with your own choices. To become a noble self-creator means 
loving yourself and having reverence for who you are. You see your way of 
existing as the definition of the admirable. It also means seeing those people 
who fail to live as you do (nobly) as pitiful, contemptible, and weak.
Nobles are in control of themselves
Being an existentialist means organizing your life in accordance with a pur-
pose or meaning that reflects your own unique individuality. Only in this way 
can you be said to truly control your own self. Nietzsche thinks of this person 
as noble.
 
The noble individual is autonomous, whereas the non-noble is heteronomous. 
The word autonomous comes apart into two Greek terms: the term auto, which 
means self, and the term nomos, which means law or rule. Taken together, the 
terms mean self-ruling. Essentially, an autonomous person gives himself his 
own rules to live by. If your way of engaging with the world doesn’t reflect your 
own self-created rules and purposes, you aren’t ruled by the autos (the self). 
In this case, you’re heteronomous — a term that contains hetero, which means 
other, and again nomos, or rule. That’s the description that sticks to the non-
noble; he’s ruled by the other. Non-nobles engage with the world based on the 
rules and purposes of others, so they aren’t self-controlling.
 
Nietzsche isn’t saying that the autonomous noble person (the individual) 
rejects the rules of those around him and tries to behave like a lunatic. In fact, 
the noble person may follow the laws of society, but only on the presumption 
that he has concluded that those rules are worth following. The noble person 
is always ready to step away from society’s rules when they fail to cohere with 
his sense of how he should live his life.
Ask yourself what constitutes your ultimate worth and significance. Is it that 
you’re a member of some group (society, your peers, your family, or your culture)? 
If so, what you are reduces to that. Without that group, you’re nothing. If you 

246
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
don’t reduce to that group, your ultimate worth and significance transcend 
it. The noble understands himself as transcending external groups. He may 
be in those groups, but he doesn’t see his significance as wholly exhausted 
by them. That’s why the meaning he gives his life — or how he organizes his 
desires — must come from what’s inside himself.
To keep this distinction between different ways of understanding the ultimate 
significance of the individual, think of one as reductionist and the other as 
existentialist in character:
 
 If you’re a reductionist, you believe that what you are — your ultimate 
value and significance — can be understood strictly in terms of some-
thing external. You reduce to those external things.
 
 If you’re an existentialist, you reject reductionism about your own value. 
You may be related to other things, but your significance and value are 
unique and internal to you. Your value can’t be explained away.
 
Living nobly isn’t easy to do. It requires a willingness to stand alone and apart 
from the crowd. Could you endure solitude? Can you create your own meaning 
and purpose, even if they depart from everything you’ve been told is right and 
good? Most people will claim they do this all the time. But how many of them 
are really in self-deception? How much of an individual are you, in actuality? 
How much about you is mere reflection of the masses around you? How much 
in control of you are they?
Nobles in the arts
The existentialist self-creator is portrayed as 
separating himself from external notions of 
what’s right. Not surprisingly, in literature and 
film this character is typically portrayed as 
dastardly and malicious (though for the exis-
tentialist, this isn’t necessary; it just makes for 
good art). Two examples are Raskolnikov from 
Feodor Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment 
and Colonel Kurtz from the film Apocalypse 
Now. Both characters come to view them-
selves as freed from the chains imposed upon 
them by external values and decide to re-create 
their lives apart from those codes. Kurtz fights 
the Vietnam War in a way that’s liberated from 
what he calls “lying timid morality” (with some 
ugly consequences!), and Raskolnikov plans 
and executes the murder of a pawnbroker, 
seeing himself as being above the straitjacket 
of morality imposed by those around him. As 
both characters learn, being a self-creator is 
difficult, because nothing outside you can offer 
a justification for your chosen way of living. You 
must function as your own source of justification, 
and that’s not as easy to do as it sounds.

247
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Nobles love themselves
A noble individual creates and gives himself his own meaning and never 
accepts value from the outside. To create yourself in this way is to become 
like God; you decide what value is and what expresses that value. The noble 
sees himself as the source of value itself, and not surprisingly, the noble 
loves himself.
 
In Nietzsche’s words, the noble “experiences himself as a person who deter-
mines value and does not need to have other’s approval.” The noble does not 
associate the idea of value or meaning with what’s external to him. Instead, 
value is something that he creates. He lives on his own terms. He writes his 
own rules.
This makes sense in the general existential picture. If God has died (which 
we discuss at length in Chapter 3) — and that means that the notion of value 
being external is no longer seen as believable — you can’t honestly look out-
side yourself any longer to discover how you should live or how you should 
interpret the world. As a result of the emptying of meaning from the world, the 
noble creates his own meaning. As Nietzsche puts it, after God’s death, “must 
not we become Gods ourselves?” The noble takes on the challenge and does.
If the noble creates his own meaning, he has to love and admire himself, 
because he sees himself as the new authoritative source from which meaning 
flows. Thus, Nietzsche says that when the noble contemplates the question 
“What is good?” he naturally thinks about himself and about the kind of life 
that he lives. His experience of himself is one of complete self-affirmation and 
self-love. His life just is the good.
Noble living requires that you do the following:
 
 Experience yourself as the meaning of the good.
 
 Be self-affirmative.
 
 Love yourself.
This may sound pretty egoistic and self-important. It is! But shouldn’t it be? 
The noble has taken on the task of creating his own meaning in a meaningless 
world. He creates value and imposes value on the world through his way of 
engaging with that world. He’s proud of what he does and doesn’t hide from 
it. Should he be humble about his worth? Heck, no! Of course, you don’t want 
to wrongly exaggerate your value, but you don’t want to be shy about your 
value either.

Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Nobles have contempt for nonindividuals
What the noble, self-creating, authentic individual thinks of the other people 
in the world depends on who those people are. Some will turn out to be good, 
and some bad. Recognizing these distinctions, being noble means that you 
have to be harsh and judgmental. You don’t see everything as the same.
Clearly, if you see other nobles in the world, you’ll see them as also being 
engaged in the project of meaningful self-creation. Fellow artists! You see 
them as good, because they reflect your standard of what’s valuable. As a 
result, regardless of what, specifically, those other nobles posit as their own 
goals and purposes, you’ll embrace them as equals.
 
The vast majority of people aren’t noble. They don’t meet the challenges of life 
honestly. Some don’t have goals; they’re like train wrecks psychologically. Their 
lives are scattered and without direction and purpose. Others have goals, but 
they aren’t self-created; as a result, they live in self-deception and hide from 
their role and responsibility as creators of meaning. Nietzsche calls these people 
slaves and suggests that the noble experiences them as the exemplification 
of the bad. What the noble means by bad is that slaves are common or lowly. 
They’re deserving of contempt.
Isn’t that mean? Not really. The noble believes that everyone wants, or at 
least should want, to be in control of his own destiny, to live as an individual. 
Who wouldn’t? The slave fails at doing so and thus is seen as controlled by 
his weaknesses. Thus, the slave is a failure at life. Lacking the strength to 
posit a unique goal, he turns to the goals of others. But that’s a pitiful way to 
exist, one that should be held in contempt. Slaves fail to tackle life head on 
in a courageous and honest way. They’re cowards, and the noble is honest 
enough to say so.
 
You may feel that this viewpoint is a bit rough or judgmental. Well, frankly, 
it is. If you feel that it’s not quite right — that no one should see anyone as 
beneath him — Nietzsche would say that the slave in you is talking and taking 
control of your perspective. You need to take control of that impulse before 
it takes control of you! Face it: Greatness is exemplary; it’s individual. If you 
want to dare to be great, you have to recognize that some things aren’t great; 
instead, they’re weak or lowly. If you can’t handle that kind of judgmental 
heat, get out of the kitchen, Nietzsche says! Perhaps slave life would be more 
comfortable for you.

 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Relishing Change As Essential 
to a Noble Life
An authentic existential life requires making hard choices about how to 
define yourself as a unique individual and then organizing the desires that 
compose you so that the resulting structure obeys the meaning that you’ve 
given yourself. However, it’s also essential to the existential notion of the self 
that the meaning you give to your life make sense only in a context.
When your experiences change, so do your desires, and as a result, new ways of 
seeing things emerge. Being an individual requires that you’re always challenging 
and rethinking your way of understanding yourself to see whether it remains 
an appropriate expression of who you are in the unique world you’re living in.
Noble individuals embrace change not only in the world, but also in their 
own sense of self. They aren’t afraid to give themselves new goals and pur-
poses when their own unique individuality demands it. Nietzsche calls it the 
need for self-overcoming. To fail to acknowledge this need is to fall victim to 
dogma, a belief in the timeless value of one way of organizing the self or of 
understanding the world. Dogma always stifles individuality by leading you to 
reject change as an essential part of what you are, and in so doing causes you 
to fail to live in accord with the challenges of existentialism.
Nobles embrace change
The self is always in flux. As time progresses, you naturally experience new 
situations and come to have new beliefs, new desires, and new impulses. As a 
result, what it means to engage the world as a unique individual is always an 
open question.
The goals you gave yourself at age 15 or the way your desires were organized 
then likely aren’t appropriate to you now. It would seem weird if you were 
always obligated to engage with the world in the way that your 15-year-old 
self did. You may have been noble then (probably not!), but that nobility was 
dependent on the way that self was internally made up and on the specific 
context that self lived in at the time. After you put a self into a wholly new 
world, its nobility must be re-created anew.
This reveals a key existential intuition: You’re always ultimately responsible 
for the way you engage with the world. Saying that you engage with the world 
in a certain way because that’s the way you’ve always done things is just as 
inauthentic as saying you interact with the world in a certain way because 

250
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
that’s the way others do things. Just as much as the noble person is always 
ready to separate himself from the ways that society lives, you must be able 
to maintain a similar distance from your own past self.
 
One of Nietzsche’s fictional characters, Zarathustra (from his famous work 
Thus Spoke Zarathustra), says, “And this secret spoke Life herself unto me. 
‘Behold,’ said she, ‘I am that which must always overcome itself.’” New situa-
tions, Nietzsche feels, call for new, fresh interpretations, and those new inter-
pretations may require different ways of organizing the drives and habits that 
constitute who you are. Nietzsche calls this essential part of noble individual-
ity self-overcoming.
 
Nobles embrace self-overcoming, the need to continually alter and move past 
the specific ways in which they engaged the world in the past.
In fact, the noble’s sense of love for himself demands that he never rest 
content in an identity that he’s already created. What the noble loves about 
himself isn’t some set of meanings or goals that he created, but his role as a 
creator of meaning. The noble loves his ability to will himself, and he strives 
to maintain that will. Loving one’s self means not abdicating that role.
Nobles reject dogma
Most people don’t like the idea that being an individual means continually 
re-creating the self. They’d rather create a timeless identity and stick to it 
forever. Mistaking the noble love of the self as refashioning a changing flux or 
desires with liking some particular version of one’s identity is easy to do. For 
Nietzsche, becoming wedded to some particular version of yourself or the 
world is hostile to life. Nobles must reject it vigorously.
 
Nietzsche thinks we need to face up to the fact that there are no timeless 
truths. There is no right structure to things in world or even to you. Instead, 
all truth and all value are really functions of a specific context. (As discussed 
earlier in this chapter, all truth is perspectival.) If this is so, there can’t be 
some “one way” to always look at the world. But that’s what dogma argues!
 
Always remember that for the existentialists, when you’re tempted toward 
thinking that your self has an essential timeless structure, it’s always a sign 
that some internal weakness in you is gaining expression. Why do people turn 
to fixed truths about the world and about themselves? Well, change is difficult; 
it requires adjustment, the constant reshuffling of desires, and the frustration 
of not satisfying some desires in you that are no longer seen as appropri-
ate. Change is just painful, and for those who, out of weakness, prefer the 
security of happiness to being unique individuals (remember, for Nietzsche, 
these aren’t necessarily correlated!), timeless truths are just what the doctor 
ordered! Unfortunately, that doctor isn’t concerned with your existential 
health! Nietzsche, on the other hand, is.

251
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Feeling as though you’ve found the right way to be or the right way to see the 
world is very comforting. It makes you feel you’re in sync with some truth 
about things that you didn’t create and that assure you that what you’re 
doing is valuable. Imagine making a difficult decision. Isn’t it easier to make 
that decision when you can authenticate it on a system of value that you 
didn’t create?
How many times have you searched through the Bible, social code, or favor-
ite book of philosophy to justify the way you see or interact with the world? 
Have you ever tried to justify your behavior in terms of what your own past 
self would do?
Maybe you should just get off that merry-go-round of self-deception. Aren’t 
all these responses really just ways of avoiding your existential responsibility 
to choose for yourself? To create your own identity right now?
Life is self-overcoming. You must always see who you are in a particular situ-
ation as transcending the ways in which you’ve seen things before. The true 
individual noble rejects, Nietzsche says, “worship of the state, the tyranny of 
demagogues and the tyranny of the crowd.” Most of all, they reject worship 
of their own past selves!
The noble life is a path, not a destination
Being a noble individual means organizing the desires that compose your 
self around a unique aim or project that gives your life individual meaning. 
It also means rooting out weaknesses within yourself that pull you toward 
conformity and dogma (whether about yourself or about the world) so that 
you always remake and reshape your own self as your experiences change. 
This path is so difficult that the archetypical noble — Nietzsche calls him 
the Übermensch (which means superperson or overman, the person who is 
beyond the form of current humanity) — has yet to exist on earth.
Nietzsche’s pessimism about the actual scarcity of these individuals doesn’t 
mean that you can’t strive to be noble. But you have to keep at it. You stay 
on the road of nobility as long as you elect to do so. It doesn’t really matter 
if you stay on the road for a year if you finally decide, at the end, to turn off 
it. It doesn’t matter that you were on the road if you’re not now. Being a self 
isn’t something you are; it’s something you do.
 
If you choose this road, many temptations will surface to distract you from 
the task of becoming an exemplary noble individual. The path will be highly 
frustrating at times, and painful, and you’ll always be making things difficult 
on yourself (as will others!). But who ever said that being in control of your 
life and expanding on your own creative possibilities as a unique individual 
should be easy things? Aren’t all great things worth striving for? Perhaps even 
suffering for? Nietzsche’s fictional character Zarathustra puts it best when, in 

252
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
talking about the relationship between individuality and happiness, he says, 
“My suffering and my sympathy for suffering — what does it matter! Do I then 
strive after happiness? I strive after my work!”
Indeed, he’s right, isn’t he? Life isn’t about aiming for pleasure or about 
things being easy or about being happy. These goals are for people who don’t 
have the strength to live nobly. No, for the noble, it’s all about the work of 
continually creating yourself into an individual.
Nobility Means Striving for Power
Existentialism argues that you must always subject your self-created goals 
to continuing challenge, opening the door to the ever-present possibilities 
of renewed self-creation. But how do you know if you’re responding to new 
experiences in appropriate ways that uniquely reflect your individual nature? 
Nietzsche responds by suggesting that noble interaction cultivates and pur-
sues power.
Power means that after you posit a goal or meaning for your life, you must 
seek out experiences and perspectives that differ from that goal or meaning; you 
must meet the new experiences and perspectives in battle, so to speak. Your aim 
is to learn to express yourself in new and more sophisticated ways — in other 
words, in the new ways made possible by encountering those new experiences.
The result of pursuing power is twofold:
 
 Your identity, or way of organizing your desires in line with a goal, is 
made more beautiful through the ever-more-complex ways it’s capable of 
expressing itself through new, diverse experiences. Power is increased 
in this way, because it takes greater strength to hold together a self 
whose inner tensions are always being expanded through the incorpora-
tion of different viewpoints and perspectives.
 
 Living nobly means exposing the self to conditions that can make your 
life goal unstable. Noble living pushes the envelope and requires the cul-
tivation of danger as a lifestyle — putting the current version of who you 
are in continual jeopardy. Putting your self on the line takes real courage 
and inner strength. Only in this way do you really cultivate a sense of 
power and embrace who you are!
Life is all about power
Nietzsche frequently connects life and power. In one particularly infamous 
passage, he suggests that “life itself is essentially appropriation, injury, 

253
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
overpowering of what is alien and weaker; suppression, hardness, imposition 
of one’s own forms, incorporation and at least, at its mildest, exploitation . 
. .” Although admittedly harsh in tone, Nietzsche thinks that being a noble 
individual means accepting that life includes the desire for acquiring power 
in these ways.
How? What Nietzsche wants you to see is that acquiring power doesn’t neces-
sarily mean dominating other people. Instead, you cultivate a specific kind of 
self and a specific kind of life that displays or reflects a kind of inner power.
 
In The Genealogy of Morals, Nietzsche writes, “In the beginning, the noble 
caste was always the barbarian caste; their superiority lay, not in physical 
force, primarily, but in force of soul — they were more complete men.” This is 
an illuminating quote, because in it Nietzsche is making two key points. First, 
he states that the nobles of ancient times were the most powerful physical 
force on earth (he’s thinking perhaps of the early Romans), but he suggests 
that this kind of outer power doesn’t explain why they were superior. So what 
did? He says that it lies in their completeness.
 
Here’s an example to help clarify this point. When coauthor Chris was young, 
he endured a few situations in which he was bullied at school. His mom said 
that bullies aren’t really powerful; in actuality, they’re weak inside, and their 
weakness expresses itself as the desire to beat up smaller kids. The fact that 
they’re big enough to accomplish this shouldn’t fool you into thinking that they 
aren’t actually weak, because it’s really their weakness that drives their actions. 
Weakness — not strength — controls the bully and drives his behavior.
Chris’s mom was onto something, Nietzsche might say. The weakness that 
expresses itself in bullies is an inner weakness or incompleteness. They lack real 
courage. They never put themselves at risk and actually challenge themselves. 
The ability to put yourself at risk — even if you may not survive — shows a kind 
of confidence that Nietzsche would say is needed for inner power.
Inner power has two elements. First, inner power expresses itself in the 
demand that you organize and place order on your desires through the 
creation of a passionate goal for your life. How well can you impose your 
own goal on your own desires and forge a sense of inner order? Second, 
inner power hates dogma and the weakness associated with it. Through 
inner power, the noble wants to see just how far his passionate goal can be 
expanded in the world against all challenges to it. How far can you overpower 
other perspectives and incorporate them into your goal and meaning? As a 
result, you see the following:
 
 Noble life requires making risk a part of your life.
 
 Noble life requires continual challenge.

254
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
True power seeks to develop 
internal beauty
Nietzsche thinks that you must live in a way that reflects your unique individ-
uality. However, he also thinks that truly embracing your individuality means 
wanting to see how many new, diverse desires and experiences you can 
incorporate into your life. The ability to incorporate many diverse perspec-
tive within yourself but remain focused on a definite goal or purpose reveals 
true inner power through an inner beauty reflective of an artistry of living.
The way that you give your life a meaning is your way of interpreting and 
interacting with the world. But what’s important isn’t the goal you pick, but 
how you live that goal. Visualize the process of producing a painting. Say 
that you decide to paint a picture with a specific kind of content: the sea. The 
question now becomes how you can paint that picture in the most beautiful 
way. One idea may be to try to paint the picture with as many colors as you 
can, realizing that this method means producing that content in the most dif-
ficult way — the way that requires the greatest ability and power as an artist.
Now think of the goal or meaning that you give your life. That’s the content 
of the painting. The question is how many desires and perspectives (colors) 
you can paint that goal with. The more conflicting the desire or perspective 
is to incorporate under that goal, the more beautiful that goal becomes when 
it successfully incorporates those new perspectives through self-mastery. 
Thus, the more power the self has, the more it seeks to express its meaning 
and goal through the most difficult situations. It wants to expose that aim or 
goal to experiences that seem to even contradict it, all in the name of seeking 
to make that goal’s expression even more beautiful.
Imagine that you live a religious life. How would you live like this through 
the cultivation of power? Well, you seek out situations and perspectives that 
are, or at least seem to be, inconsistent with it. Perhaps you recognize that 
people say religion and science don’t go together, so you strive to learn a lot 
about science. You aim, however, is to learn about science, which you view 
as dangerous to your worldview, with the hope of incorporating science into 
your way of looking at things — religiously! Of course, you may find your goal 
weakened and overpowered by what you seek out. That’s the risk. You may 
find your self defeated, and you may turn into one of those psychological 
train wrecks we talked about earlier. For this reason, not everyone has the 
courage to expose his identity in this way.
If you think about it, what Nietzsche is really asking you to do here is to live 
your sense of who you are. If you really believe in your goal, really love it and 
feel passionate about it, you want to experience all the ways that it can be 

255
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
expressed (Kierkegaard talks similarly about the self as requiring passion; if 
you’re interested, jump to Chapter 7 to learn more). In a way, it’s like getting 
a new car and wanting to know how fast it can go.
 
Truly honoring your purpose in life is living it passionately — pushing it to go 
faster and faster, each time pushing it, and yourself, to the limit. For Nietzsche, 
the famous song lyric “It’s better to burn out than to fade away” characterizes 
noble living.
Powerful nobles ignore neighbors
Some people like to choose friends who are pretty much exactly like them. 
They look for clones. Nietzsche says these people look to surround them-
selves with neighbors. Nietzsche despises neighbor-seeking because it means 
looking to be surrounded by people who don’t challenge you. Nobles don’t 
do that, because they always seek to live their identities by exposing them to 
conflict and challenge.
 
Nietzsche’s fictional character Zarathustra points out that “your neighbor-
love is your bad love of yourselves. . . . You call in a witness when you want 
to speak well of yourselves; and when you have misled him to think well of 
you, you also think well of yourselves.” What Nietzsche means here is that 
when you don’t actually like yourself, or when you don’t want who you are to 
be challenged, you seek people who will tell you that who you are right now 
is perfectly good and acceptable. Sartre would say that we run around trying 
to find just the right people — namely, those who will tell us exactly what we 
want to hear! When this happens, you become seduced away from living in a 
noble fashion by the good feeling you get from the compliments.
Embracing change means exposing yourself to new and different perspec-
tives. The neighbor-seeker rests on his laurels and continues to think of his 
self in the same old tired ways. He hates change; thus, he hates that aspect 
of himself and tries to avoid it. Think of today’s most popular, young, spoiled 
Hollywood stars. They’re neighbor-lovers. They surround themselves with 
people who are essentially paid to tell them how great they are. Because of 
that, such people will have a hard time being noble.
People who seek neighbors fear that they’re too weak to be themselves — 
which involves change — so they try to secure the longevity of some fixed 
idea of who they are. They fear, and often hate, the part of themselves that 
requires change.

256
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
Nobles cultivate friendships 
with their enemies
The noble seeks friends because they can help him on his path to becoming 
more powerful. A friend would ideally share the desire for attaining nobil-
ity and seeking power, but beyond that, a true friend likely will differ on the 
specific path of what being noble turns out to look like (which is required, 
because you’re all individuals).
 
Nietzsche’s character Zarathustra recognizes, at one point of the fictional 
story, that his disciples are looking to copy his specific way of living or his 
specific goal. As a friend, he must stop them from doing this because he 
knows that living by the goals of others stems from weakness and fear, and so 
isn’t healthy. To help them, he prods them to leave him and find themselves 
as individuals. He says, “This — is now my way — where is yours? Thus did I 
answer those who asked me ‘the way.’ For the way — it does not exist!”
Nietzsche thinks that a great friend really acts like an enemy. As Zarathustra 
puts it, “In your friend, you should possess your best enemy. Your heart should 
feel closest to him when you oppose him.” He’s always looking for a weakness 
of yours to exploit, to expose you for your own flaws and imperfections. If 
you’ve unknowingly succumbed to some self-deception and weakness, the 
true friend will let you know! According to Nietzsche, the noble friend is a 
gift-giver; through his actions, he provides you with the ability to be great by 
challenging you. Given that all true friendships are reciprocal, you return the 
favor, of course!
 
Coauthor Chris likes to read about Confucianism, which holds that living life in 
a petty and selfish way is unacceptable. Every so often, Chris comes up with a 
way of interpreting something or acts a certain way in a situation, and his wife 
says, “Umm . . . isn’t that how a petty person would see things?” This kind of 
realization hurts; it reveals to Chris that he’s succumbed to a kind of weakness 
within his self that he hadn’t yet seen. But this kind of comment is what makes 
Chris’s wife an excellent noble friend. Her aim isn’t to create the conditions for 
Chris’s happiness but to create the conditions for his own nobility — to help 
him take charge of his self and be an individual.
 
What kind of people do you surround yourself with? Do you seek out friends 
who agree with most of what you believe? Do you get angry with your friends 
when they tell you the truth about ways that you deceive yourself? Do you 
expect them to do such things? Or do you really want to be surrounded by 
yes-saying neighbors?

257
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Nobles live dangerously
In an interesting quote, Nietzsche says, “Live dangerously! Build your cities 
on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your ships into uncharted seas! Live at war 
with your peers and yourselves!” You have to live passionately, always push-
ing the envelope.
No one could possibly think that Nietzsche actually means that you should 
literally sell your home and rebuild on the slopes of an active volcano (although 
the real estate on the slopes of Vesuvius may actually be pretty cheap). Neither 
is Nietzsche pushing you to go out and become an extreme sports enthusiast, 
jumping from bridges with bungee cords attached to your feet or leaping from 
planes and skydiving (he may not be opposed to it, either).
At the same time, though, he’s saying something very similar: He wants you 
to engage in the existential version of those things. The bungee-jumper, the 
skydiver, and the Vesuvius home builder all have one thing in common: 
They don’t view the best life as the longest life. Instead, they seem to always 
want to push the envelope. They view a good and excellent life as one that’s 
always put at risk. That’s the only way to truly value and honor life.
So how can you do that? How can you live on the slopes of Vesuvius? Simple: 
Go to the library. Read a book on a subject that completely disagrees with 
the way that you’ve chosen to live your life. Learn about your history. See 
whether you’re the victim of self-deception. Seek to unsettle yourself; shake 
up what you think and believe. When you’re in public, seek out the kinds 
of people who disagree with you passionately, and talk to them. Cultivate 
friendships with these kinds of people. Surround yourself with the seeds of 
your own destruction. Nietzsche once claimed, “I am not a man, I am dyna-
mite!” Well, if you’re dynamite, surround yourself with matches!
 
Nietzsche’s noble is a warrior. He writes, “What matters long life! What warrior 
wishes to be spared!” Are you ready to be a warrior for your self-created iden-
tity and goal? Can you subject your identity to that kind of battle? Do you love 
yourself enough? Are you willing to die for who you are?
Being a Slave: Rejecting Individuality 
through Hatred
Nietzsche thinks that it’s important for you to respond to the death of God 
(see Chapter 3) by giving your own life a unique and individual shape and 
meaning. This means, at least, not passively adopting external notions of 

258
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
what’s valuable. But what about people who reject this challenge and define 
themselves in terms of what’s external to them?
Nietzsche calls these people slaves. You can become a slave in two ways. 
One is through what Nietzsche calls resentment and the other through becoming 
absorbed into what he calls the herd. In both cases, you end up adopting life-
negating values, but the way in which you adopt them is different. In this section 
we look at resentment, and in the next section, we look at the herd.
Turning to resentment, the subject of this section, we can say that the slave 
wants to be noble but finds it difficult to master his world; he can’t engage 
with it in ways of his own choosing. This failure means that he’s constantly 
frustrated, so he lives in pain and suffering. As a way of dealing with this situ-
ation, the slave focuses his growing hatred and anger on the noble and his 
way of living. Through resentment, he creates meaning for himself by negating 
everything that the noble stands for. Thus, although this gives the slave a nega-
tive goal to organize his life around — not being noble — the goal isn’t unique 
and is also decadent, because it calls the slave to deny what he really desires: 
the pursuit of individuality and noble power.
Coping with oppression by changing 
your interpretation of the situation
Nietzsche thinks everyone desires, on a fundamental level, to master his 
own world. Everyone wants to be noble. This is a basic existential premise: 
Everyone strives to engage with the world on his own terms. Some people 
find this task almost impossible because they’re oppressed in some way, 
perhaps by another group of people. Some people are simply too weak. As 
a result, part of these people’s identity is forced into suppression, and as a 
result, they experience suffering. One way to fix the problem is to turn to 
self-deception.
Imagine that you live in a time when the group you’re associated with is 
totally dominated by some other group (being a peasant in the presence of 
knights or being a Jew in the presence of Romans, for example). The domi-
nant group sees and treats your group as the embodiment of what’s lowly 
and deserving of contempt. It’s no doubt true that the ancient noble isn’t a 
particularly nice person. He pushes you around; he physically abuses you. He 
forces you to work 20 hours a day for a pot of gruel and a snickering promise 
to let you live another day. To him, you’re just a tool, and you have no fur-
ther function or meaning. Your life is one of perpetual violation.
 
The slave, however, is no different from the noble; he also wants to engage the 
world on his own terms. But he can’t. So his life isn’t just violation, but also 
frustration. Whereas the noble experiences himself as power and connection 
with the world, the slave experiences himself as weakness and disconnection.

259
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Fortunately, you’ll likely never experience the slave’s circumstances, but 
you’ve probably felt like the slave in smaller situations in which you sense 
that you’re completely out of control and ineffective in your life. When this 
happens, the feeling is just unbearable. On some level, you must acquire 
some kind of feeling of control over your life. But how can the slave do this? 
When you’ve been in these situations, how have you responded to them?
Well, you do have one thing at your disposal: You can change the way you 
see the situation. You can use your imagination to reinterpret the situation 
so that it no longer looks as though you’re weak or not in control. If you can 
pull that off, this life isn’t so bad after all! Heck, go for broke. Why not reinter-
pret it so that you come out to be strong! Nietzsche thinks that to live on, the 
slave learns to become clever, to cease living honestly in exchange for the 
ability to endure the unbearable suffering of his own existence.
Learning to see through the eyes of hate
To be noble means to experience yourself as the embodiment of power. To 
be a slave is to experience yourself as weakness. These different viewpoints 
obviously lead to different perspectives of the self and those around you.
A noble’s love
The consciousness of the noble is filled with self-affirmation and self-love. 
On the other hand, the slave’s consciousness is filled with hatred and 
self-loathing. This difference results in very different ways of evaluating 
the world.
The noble interprets and interacts with the world as he chooses. He’s a self-
creator, and he loves himself and his life. He enjoys navel-gazing, looking at 
himself and getting caught up in his infatuation with his own nature and life. 
You can imagine that nobles get together and have lots of parties celebrating 
their lives. Thus, it’s not surprising that when the noble decides what’s good 
and what isn’t, he starts with what he’s always looking at — himself — and he 
deems it to be good.
After doing this, he does remember that other things aren’t noble. He then 
labels them accordingly; they’re the bad, which just means “not like me.” The 
noble’s way of evaluating the world starts with the value he assigns to him-
self; then he understands everything else in those terms. Nietzsche calls this 
way of looking at the world master morality. It epitomizes in structure what it 
means to take up the existential challenge of creating meaning for yourself.
A slave’s hate
The slave’s life, on the other hand, is filled with frustration and pain and suf-
fering. When he looks at himself and navel-gazes, he feels nothing but his 
own impotence and weakness. As a result, it’s not surprising that the slave 

260
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
doesn’t want to do a whole lot of navel-gazing. If anything, the slave needs 
a way to keep his attention away from himself so that he isn’t continually 
reminded of who he is. So what does the slave focus his attention on?
Well, try to place yourself in the mind of the slave. What’s the mood in there? 
Yeah, you guessed it — lots of pervasive anger and hatred (it’s hard to blame 
him). So toward whom should the slave direct that anger and hatred? He 
could focus it on himself, but that means having to be reminded of his own 
weakness. But he has a better option: Focus it on the noble! The slave toils 
away in the field, always thinking of the master and how he hates him. Ever 
done this? Found yourself sitting at some hated job/school/home always 
seething and thinking of that hated boss/professor/parent and how evil he is?
Because the slave’s mindset is so different from the noble’s (as summarized 
in Table 11-1), it’s pretty evident that his way of evaluating the world is dif-
ferent. If you’re a slave, instead of evaluating yourself affirmatively and then 
evaluating everything else in terms of your self-created meaning, you start by 
evaluating the object that’s always the focus of your attention — the other — 
and because you think of that object with hate, you evaluate it negatively. So 
you evaluate the object of your hatred as evil and then evaluate the rest of the 
world in those terms. Basically, you’ve learned to paint the entire world in the 
colors of your hatred. Nietzsche calls this way of evaluating slave morality.

Using hatred to creatively 
reinterpret the world
When you find yourself oppressed and ineffective in your life, hatred and 
what Nietzsche calls resentment can come in handy. What’s particularly 
impressive is that you can use your hatred at these times to reinterpret your 
world in a way that makes your own oppression seem like something that’s 
actually valuable. Now, that’s a feat!
 
How can you use hatred to reinterpret life and make it more bearable? An 
example may help. When coauthor Chris was young, he was very poor. Just 
as the slave actually wants to be like the noble and to master the world as he 
does, Chris wanted to be like the rich. They seemed to live life; they seemed 
fully effective in their own world. But being young, Chris had no way to be 

261
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
rich any time soon. So Chris knew his suffering and feelings of impotence were 
likely to continue for a long time. He wanted to feel effective and in control, 
but he couldn’t. Like the slave, he was trapped.
But Chris, like the slave, was clever. He learned to reinterpret the situation. 
He began to mix his envy of the rich with an ever-present hatred of them 
(based on a jealousy about what he didn’t have and couldn’t attain), and the 
two combined to form resentment. Like the slave, he began to reevaluate 
the world through his hatred — in this case, his hatred of the rich. First, he 
decided that the rich were evil. The rich were inauthentic and stupid, out of 
touch with reality, and deluded in their splendor. Of course, he noted, no one 
in his right mind would want to be rich! Power, wealth, and opulence — they 
were all signs of what was wrong with the world.
Of course, this isn’t the end of the evaluation of the world, because it hasn’t 
yet produced its goal: making Chris feel effective and in control. In fact, this 
is the point at which his hatred (or resentment) gets really creative — and 
sneaky. Remember, what wasn’t rich was good. So what was Chris? What a 
surprise — Chris, being poor, was good! Ah — suddenly his suffering became 
more bearable! By a brilliant turn of self-deception, Chris convinced himself 
that being poor was really, as the slang phrase would put it, keeping it real, 
an obvious sign of truth and authenticity. Poor people understood the real 
truth of things and weren’t deluded. They were actual, real, truthful people. 
Alas, he figured, seeing the truth about things means enduring suffering. “Ah, 
well,” Chris said to himself, “that’s the cross I’ll have to bear!”
What a brilliant move! Now, at long last, Chris’s suffering, which was once 
seen as nothing but weakness and impotence, could be given a new mean-
ing — one that had a positive connotation. Essentially, the more he suffered, 
the more authentic he was; suffering and lack of power were now signs of 
his own greatness! What a twisted artist Chris had become — how creative! 
Have you ever done that before? How much of your own values, when you’re 
honest, are driven by resentment?
Letting resentment take 
control of your life
Nietzsche thinks when you’re weak, you sometimes turn to creative decep-
tions to rationalize your life. Realizing that you really want something but are 
too weak to acquire it, you convince yourself that you really never wanted 
it in the first place or even that you worked hard to reject it. Afterward, you 
build your life around those deceptions and use them to give meaning to 
your life and the situations you live in. Still, as much as the slave is organiz-
ing his life around a goal, it’s not an individual noble goal because it cedes 

262
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
control to something outside itself. So it fails the existential challenge to self-
create as a unique meaning.
 
As we mentioned before, when coauthor Chris was young, he rationalized his 
own poverty and his suffering as something good by seeing the rich — or the 
drive to be rich — as evil. People use this deception all the time. The hopeful 
soon-to-be cheerleader gets rejected by the squad and then surprisingly dis-
covers that cheerleaders are really superficial and that her rejection by them 
actually proves that she has depth. How many times have you done this in 
your life? We don’t know about you, but we know that we’ve lost count.
Is this way of giving your life meaning individual and unique to you? It isn’t. 
In this case, you allow some system of value external to you to decide what 
is and isn’t meaningful. How so? In Chris’s case, perhaps not surprisingly, he 
didn’t major in business when he was in college. Why not? Well, maybe he’d 
already convinced himself that only the inauthentic are driven to pursue 
riches. So he majored in philosophy, in which you can’t expect to ever make 
much money.
If you think about this “without prejudice,” as Nietzsche would say, it looks 
as though Chris wasn’t noble at all. Perhaps he didn’t forge a courageous path 
of self-definition. Instead, he let his resentment against the rich structure the 
very ways in which he understood his own life. As a result, the value system of 
the rich controlled him, just flipped upside down! In a way, Chris’s actual envy 
of the rich continued, but negatively. His self-deception allowed him to con-
tinue to mirror them, but in opposition. His entire way of looking at the world 
and interacting with it is still defined by the values of the rich. Chris deceived 
himself into thinking that he freed himself of the object of his hate, when really 
all he did was chain himself to it more securely.
 
What this story reveals is that it can’t be the case that only those who match 
the behavior of some external source are conformists. Those who live their 
lives trying to be the opposite of that external source are conformists too. 
Think of pop culture. For some people, you can predict with uncanny assur-
ance what their favorite music will be. Just look at the top-ten charts. Some 
people love what the music industry — and their peers — tell them to love.
But don’t you also know some people who are the opposite? You can predict 
that whatever music is in the top ten, they’ll hate it. Whatever clothes are 
chic, they’ll wear the exact opposite. Whatever movies are in, they’ll avoid. 
Aren’t they just negative conformists? Appearances to the contrary, their lives 
aren’t individual reflections of their own uniqueness. They’re just as entirely 
defined by the values of what’s outside them as the normal conformists are, just 
in reverse.
Clearly, if you become a slave, you don’t live up to the challenges of existen-
tialism, because you farm out the job of creating meaning or defining yourself 
to something external to you.

263
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Interpreting Christianity as 
just more slave talk
One of Nietzsche’s most infamous claims is that Christianity is slave-oriented. 
Christianity takes the idea that noble qualities like power, strength, pride, 
and self-love are evil and the idea that slave qualities like humility and weak-
ness are good, and it gives those judgments a timeless, objective foundation 
in religion.
Religion’s timeless truths
A central existentialist point is that values always reflect a context. So 
whether something is good or bad depends on the situation and the point of 
view or perspective you have when facing that situation. As a result, nothing 
is good or bad in itself. To argue that something is good in itself is to claim 
that value can exist in the world independently of people or of some point of 
view or of some specific context.
Slave morality has to deny that all values are contextual, so it must reject the 
basic tenets of existentialism. If the slave system is just one perspective among 
others, it isn’t particularly persuasive to the slave as a self-deception — and the 
slave needs to believe it to justify his own situation. It isn’t very convincing 
to the noble either — and the best interests of the slave include convincing 
the noble of slave values, of course. One way to accomplish both is to think 
of the values of slave morality as timeless truths grounded in the authority 
of God. If that’s right, the timeless truths of the slaves are better than those 
truths that are dependent upon perspective — those of the noble. Slave 
values are objective and unbiased, whereas noble values are neither.
Christianity’s slave morality
So religion is a good vehicle for slave morality, but how does Christianity fit 
in? According to Nietzsche, Christianity is the perfect embodiment of slave 
values because it justifies the slave’s situation and behavior by suggesting that 
the slave acts and lives the way he does not because he’s weak, but because 
this is the way God commands him to be. Sure, the slave would love to strike 
at the noble, to take revenge on him for his abusive treatment. In reality, 
Nietzsche says, the slave is too weak to do so. Christianity reinterprets the 
situation, however, and says that it takes strength of will to be able to “turn the 
other cheek” and to “love one’s enemies.” It’s not that failing to strike back is a 
sign of weakness. Doing what God commands you to do is hard. So turning the 
other cheek isn’t a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of real power to do as God 
commands. Turning the other cheek is actually a sign of power and goodness!
Of course, Nietzsche notes, the slave’s life is full of suffering. No matter how 
you reinterpret that, it still hurts; pain is pain, after all. So when does the 

264
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
slave get to be happy and free of pain? Well, says Christianity, your reward 
will come in heaven! As it (not surprisingly!) turns out, only those who live 
slavelike lives get eternal bliss. Only the meek shall inherit the earth, and it’s 
harder for a rich man to enter heaven than it is for a camel to pass through 
the eye of a needle. In heaven, the slave will receive a lot of happiness — if he 
can just manage to stay a slave (as though he has a choice!).
Don’t forget — the slave hates the noble. This fact is easily given a place; 
the slave’s religion reassures him that hell and the final judgment will deal 
with the nobles later on. Sure, those nobles may be having a grand old time 
oppressing you now, but it’ll work out in the end when they live on the lake 
of fire and have pitchforks jammed in their eyes for all eternity. As Nietzsche 
sees it, Christianity is a grand lie — a deception meant to serve the weak and 
allow them to justify their wretched, weak, and untruthful lives.
Nietzsche thinks that we’re the descendants of the slaves — that our con-
sciousness is permeated with slave values or what he considers to be the 
same thing, Christian values. This is why the death of God is such a historical 
event. History has provided us — with the growing sense of disbelief in the 
Christian God — the ability to free ourselves from these slavish lies and to 
once again take on the great task of becoming an individual, noble self. Ah, 
Nietzsche suggests, we can actually sense the possibility of being human 
once again, right there, just over the horizon!
 
We should note quickly that although Nietzsche’s view of Christianity as a reli-
gion is pretty negative, he appeared to have respect for Jesus. In one work, he 
referred to Jesus as “the last Christian,” implying that his followers go on to dis-
tort his message. From Nietzsche’s perspective, Jesus had some noble qualities. 
He created his own values, and he stood alone against the crowd. However, the 
values he created were decadent, as they seem to call for the rejection of the sort 
of noble living that Nietzsche thinks is essential to authentic life.
Mediocrity of the Herd: Rejecting 
Individuality through Conformity
According to the existentialist, being an individual means creating a mean-
ing for your own life that reflects your own uniqueness without the need to 
borrow or rely on external values. In the previous section, we discuss how 
a person can cede control of his life — and become a slave — by creating 
values through hatred.
In this section, we talk about another way to lose control and fail to be an 
individual: giving in to conformity through joining what Nietzsche calls the 
herd. Nietzsche believes that the herd, his term for the crowd or the masses, 
fears the emergence of the unique individual.

265
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
In response, the herd pressures people to cultivate a love for mediocrity and 
passivity. The herd does this by discouraging people from cultivating a sense 
of their own difference and uniqueness, instead urging them to develop only 
those traits that they share with everyone else.
The crowd takes away self-control
Everyone has succumbed to the pressures of parents or friends. They want 
you to do something their way, and you wind up doing it because they see 
it as right. When this happens, you allow external values to determine your 
direction and to take control of your life.
Sometimes you give up control not to a friend or to a parent, but to the 
crowd. Think of what your parents have probably said (or used to say) to 
you numerous times. They say, “Don’t do that; what will they think?” or “Is 
that what people do?” Who exactly are they talking about? Who are “they,” 
and who are “people”? They clearly don’t mean particular people, but the 
voice of common opinion or of society in general.
If you cede control of your life to the masses by letting their values determine 
your life, you give up on being an individual (we also discuss Heidegger’s 
view of this problem in Chapter 6 and Kierkegaard’s view in Chapter 7). 
What’s individual is necessarily in conflict with the motivation to simply con-
form to what’s group-oriented. This doesn’t mean that the individual and the 
group always do different things, but it does mean that the way in which they 
come to decide what to do is different.
The uneasy notion of hell
Many people, including some Christians, find 
themselves unsettled by the notion of hell, of a 
place for the eternal torment of those punished 
by God. Some seem to think that the idea of hell 
is inconsistent with the notion of a benevolent, 
loving God. For Nietzsche, of course, this is no 
accident; the point of heaven and hell is to pro-
vide a place for the slaves to get their rewards 
and the nobles to get their final punishments.
Are you bothered by this notion too? Does it 
seem strange to torment beings for eternity? As 
Nietzsche sarcastically comments, Christianity 
isn’t a religion of love; it’s a religion of hate. In 
fact, Nietzsche comments sarcastically on the 
writings of the 13th-century Italian poet Dante 
who, in describing the gates of hell, suggested 
that it has etched into them the sentence “I 
too was created by eternal love.” Nietzsche 
suggests that it should have been rewritten 
to say “I too was created by eternal hate.” Is 
Nietzsche right? Does the notion of hell make 
you wonder whether the person who created it, 
or the notion of it, was consumed by hatred?

266
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
To use an example, imagine that you want to group many objects in a way 
that’s meaningful. You start with two red triangular objects made of wood. 
At this point, three properties give meaning to the group: red, triangular, 
and wooden. Then you add a third object; it’s red and triangular, but made 
of steel. To add it, you can’t use wooden as part of the group’s identity any-
more; now only red and triangular will do. Then comes another object, but 
it’s blue. Now only triangular will do! Each time the group gets bigger, the 
identity of the group becomes more abstract and less and less individual.
The logic of crowd identity works similarly. The larger the whole grows, the 
more abstract the identity of the group becomes. When Mom asks, “Is that 
what they do?” it’s this faceless, abstract identity that she’s asking you to 
conform to. Maybe it’s that “New Yorkers” think this, or “Christians” say that, 
or that “Americans” think this or do that.
 
Individuals make decisions based on what reflects the interests of the individual. 
What defines a person as individual is what that person, out of inner strength, 
decides is meaningful. As a result, if the interests of the whole become the values 
that constitute your own meaning, you start to interpret and interact with the 
world in a way that doesn’t flow from who you are as an individual. Conformity 
requires that what makes you individual be left out of the equation so that you 
don’t let it influence your point of view or your perspective. If that happens, 
you don’t control yourself. You’re a robot performing the interests of the face-
less crowd.
The crowd represents the voice of the weak
Crowds or herds often come together and unify on the basis of some per-
ceived threat. At times those threats are external, and at other times they’re 
internal. In both situations, the group pressures people to develop and cul-
tivate traits that answer to a need that the group has. The second kind of 
group uniting — on the basis of internal threats — is particularly harmful to 
the existence of the noble individual. The reason is that in such a case, the 
group pressures people to acquire what Nietzsche calls decadent values. In 
other words, these groups ask members to cultivate ideals of weakness over 
ideals of strength.
At times a group forms to meet a threat posed to it by an attack from another 
group external to it. In these situations, the group encourages its members 
to develop qualities that favor greatness and strength. Particularly, the 
group favors the cultivation of strong, warrior traits in its members — a love 
for exploitation, violence, suppression, and cruelty. If society can produce 
enough of these individuals, it can use them effectively to fight against the 
threat it has encountered.

267
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
If the group is successful, peace becomes prominent. At this point, the group 
is placed in an odd position. From the point of view of the group — what’s 
common among its members — the presence of the strong, those who were 
originally beneficial to the group, is now seen as an internal threat. These 
members are a threat because what’s different and unique tends to resist 
being identified with the group. As a result, the existence of individuals is a 
threat to the group’s survival. Basically, the fate the group once feared from 
the external enemy, it now fears from the individuals in its own midst.
How should this new threat be faced? The group can’t face this threat in 
the same way it faced the original threat. Instead, to succeed in keeping the 
group cohesive, it needs to change how it influences the development of 
traits in those within it. As a consequence, it will now teach its members that 
the capacity for violence or suppression is shameful — those same qualities 
that are required for nobility — whereas virtues such as kindness and humil-
ity will be seen as strengths.
Making the emerging new people within the group toothless has a function: 
it removes the possibility that they’ll be a threat to the interests of the weak 
within the group. Herd values always flow from fear of what’s noble and 
great. As a result, herd values must be resisted by the individual.
The crowd preaches equality 
and mediocrity
Nietzsche thinks that the crowd promotes the interests of the weak in part 
by preaching mediocrity. Because your nature calls on you to strive to be dif-
ferent, superior, and unique, the way of engaging with life cultivated by the 
crowd and the individual are natural enemies.
How does the herd or crowd convince its members to identify with the inter-
ests of the weak? One of the fundamental claims of herd morality is the claim 
that everyone is naturally equal or that everyone has equal rights. If so, no 
one has more worth than anyone else. To experience the world as the noble 
does is wrong because this view rejects natural equality. After all, the noble 
sees himself as a height and looks down at others who don’t measure up. 
Those people who feel this way, the herd claims, are arrogant, shameful, and 
elitist. The herd strongly encourages this view in its members.
 
We realize that you may like equality; it seems like a good idea to rear people 
with. But think about it for a second. Where does this way of thinking lead? If 
all people are always equal, regardless of how they live, you have no reasons 
to ever look up or down upon another being. But if that’s right, your worth is 
always the same regardless of how you live. As a result, you have no reason 
to try to strive to be great. Action means nothing! In fact, striving to be great 

268
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
inevitably brings suffering and pain because it’s challenging. But if being great 
isn’t really admirable, what’s the point of the suffering it brings? This view 
has chilling effects, Nietzsche thinks, on the ways you think of yourself and on 
the ways you think about the task of living life because it suppresses and con-
demns the effort to be an authentic person — a noble.
In opposition to the noble’s ideal of the exemplary, unique, self-creating indi-
vidual, the herd puts up a counterideal: the mediocre person. Whereas the 
noble claims that striving and suffering are natural parts of life because they 
follow when you pursue excellence, the herd says that no one should strive, 
because no one can really be better than anyone else. All striving is useless 
and brings meaningless pain, so instead, you should aim to be average. You 
should work at not distinguishing yourself and be just like others. Instead of 
working to distinguish themselves by creating their own meaning, the herd 
gives its members a different job: keeping sedated and busy through the pur-
suit of superficial pleasures. Thus, the herd preaches hedonism.
 
Nietzsche worries that one day, the age of what he calls “the last man” will 
arrive. This is the age in which everyone embraces herd thought, and the very 
possibility of the great, self-creating individual disappears. In the society of 
the last man, Nietzsche says, there are “no herdsman and one herd. Everyone 
wants the same thing, everyone is the same: whoever thinks otherwise goes 
voluntarily into the madhouse.” In the culture of the mediocre, everyone 
claims that the goal of his life is to avoid pain and to be happy.
The age of consumerism
Some people suggest that society has been 
overrun by the desire for constant distraction. 
(We examine Kierkegaard’s description of this 
state of affairs in Chapter 10.) People don’t seek 
greatness anymore. If anything, their desire to 
be better than others is limited to making more 
money and gaining more possessions, not by 
the achievement of individual greatness.
To be great is to own a Lexus when your neigh-
bor has a Mazda. It’s to have a 5,000-square-foot 
house when your neighbor’s is only 3,500 square 
feet. It’s to vacation often in Acapulco so that you 
can show the pictures to your neighbor, who can’t 
afford to travel. It’s to make sure that you can get 
plastic surgery so that you look better than your 
friends. To strive for this kind of consumer great-
ness, people work harder to buy more things, and 
the more they buy, the more they need to work. 
They want to keep up with the Joneses and 
assure themselves that their neighbor’s things 
don’t outshine their own things.
Have you given up your individual passion for 
human life and instead become a consumer 
drone?

269
 Chapter 11: Nietzsche: Mastering the Art of Individuality
Beyond good and evil: Breaking 
away from the crowd
According to Nietzsche, the aim of herd mentality is to prevent the emer-
gence of its great enemy: the exemplary noble individual, the self-created 
person. After you see that herd morality (just as much as slave morality) 
isn’t an unbiased truth, but just another perspective (and one of the weak, 
at that!), Nietzsche thinks you can return to seeing your own perspective as 
valuable. After you do this, you’ll see that you must break from the chains of 
slave and herd morality and free yourself from the straitjacket of its limiting 
customs. Once again, you’ll want to create yourself! To regain control! To be 
what you are — a creator of meaning!
Nietzsche says ethical codes and religion have been used as weapons against 
you. To be fair, although Nietzsche focuses on Christianity, many religions 
from Buddhism to Hinduism to Judaism could easily be just as blamed in this 
way. What they have in common, Nietzsche would argue, is that they keep man 
mediocre and passive. They keep you harmless and toothless and unable to 
unsettle the weak. But why should your life become organized around goals 
that protect the interests of the weak? What should your revolution look like? 
Should you help members of the herd free themselves and become great too? 
Nietzsche has no desire to free the weak from their own systems of thought. 
For all he cares — and for all he thinks you should care — you should let them 
stay bound up tight in their straitjackets of morality. As he puts it, “Let the 
ideas of the herd rule in the herd.”
You’re different. As a potential exemplary individual, you’re not obligated to 
live by those rules. You must learn the need to brave the cold, outside the 
comforts — and distractions — of the mediocre, hedonistic lives that society 
lauds. You must learn to leave the herd and take on the task of being a self, of 
becoming the exemplary noble individual you can be.
From Nietzsche’s point of view. herd mentality has seeped into your con-
sciousness and made you sick. Nietzsche’s character Zarathustra, and Sartre 
himself, often talk about their nausea. How do you respond to it? You must 
begin the work of healing yourself. This means that you learn to live beyond 
good and evil — to see that what you are transcends the values of the herd. 
God is dead, and you should let the idea of external value — whether in him 
or in the herd — die. But as Nietzsche says, leaving God and external value 
behind doesn’t mean that you’ll learn to live beyond good and bad, which 
was the noble way of understanding value. You must once again regain the right 
to be noble, to experience yourself as the creator of what’s good, and to see 
others who don’t measure up as bad and pitiful. So moving beyond good and evil 

270
Par t III: Living a Meaningful Life in a Meaningless World 
isn’t a call for you to start going around saying, “Well, who’s to say?” every time 
a question of value comes up. Instead, you’ll recognize that you are to say!
It’s high time, Nietzsche thinks, that you return to the hard work of being 
what you are, of meeting the challenge of creating meaning in a meaningless 
world.

The Enduring 
Impact of 
Existentialism

In this part . . .
E
xistentialism had its heyday in the early- to mid-20th 
century. Although it’s still alive and well today, to 
some extent it has returned to its rebellious, outsider roots. 
Mainstream English-speaking philosophers tend to ignore 
the existentialists all together. On the European continent, 
postmodern philosophers look to some of the existential-
ists as forerunners of their work, but largely reject what’s 
most specifically existential. Still, existentialism has found 
new life in those philosophies that analyze and give voice 
to the situations of oppressed people, such as women, minori-
ties, and the impoverished masses that make up much of the 
world outside of the former colonial powers. Outside of 
philosophy, existentialism has had a particularly strong 
impact upon psychology. Thinkers from the German psy-
choanalyst Ludwig Binswanger to TV’s Dr. Phil have 
appropriated existential concerns and insights to further 
human well-being and mental health.

 here’s no such thing as existential politics. As with most other things, 
 existentialists don’t have a unified view of politics. Further,   no existential-
ist ever wrote a great political work like John Locke’s Second Treatise of 
Government,  which was widely read and admired by some British colonists in 
the New World who went on to use many of its ideas in drafting their constitu-
tion. Thomas Jefferson never had the opportunity to read Nietzsche and prob-
ably wouldn’t have stuck a clause in the Constitution about the death of God if 
he had. Something in existential philosophy resists the very notion of politics. 
Yet the existentialists were real people who lived in the world,   and they often 
couldn’t help but be involved politically or at least have political opinions. For 
the later existentialists (particularly the French),   these opinions often come 
out in maddeningly opaque references to politics in much of their work.
In this chapter, we give you some background and historical context to make 
reading or studying these philosophers a little easier. Politics has been a cen-
tral source of criticism for all the existentialists. Often, but not always, this 
criticism has been undeserved. Basically, the criticisms leveled at the exis-
tentialists fall into three categories:
 
 Existentialism supports Nazism: This criticism is aimed mostly at the 
German philosophers Nietzsche and Heidegger.
 
 Existentialism supports violent revolution: This criticism is mostly a 
product of Sartre and de Beauvoir’s left-wing politics. Even their friend 
and fellow existentialist Camus leveled this complaint at their version of 
existentialism.

274
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
 Existentialism leads to quietism: Existentialism leads to inaction, a 
refusal to engage in the problems of the world. This may be because it’s 
such an individualistic philosophy, it leads to a lack of concern for other 
people (Sartre’s philosophy was accused of this) or because it leads to 
resignation and acceptance of injustice in the world (Sartre accused 
Camus of this).
This chapter helps you understand what relationship really exists between 
the existential philosophies of these folks and their politics. In the process, 
we assess the justification for each of these criticisms.
In the opening sections, we examine how political the existentialists are as a 
group and whether existentialism as a philosophy lends itself to any particu-
lar politics. In the later sections, we concentrate on the politics of the individ-
ual philosophers and to what degree those politics were influenced by their 
existential philosophy.
 
Politics is a subject that’s hard to separate from history. Although existential-
ism began in the 19th century with Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, it developed, 
flowered, and had its heyday in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s in France and 
Germany. For that reason, the philosophy couldn’t help but become in many 
ways intertwined with the events of the time: the rise of Fascism, the Nazi 
Holocaust, and the cold war.
The horrors of the Nazis were devastating to the Europeans, and the events 
of the 1930s and 1940s colored their outlook for years to come. Their result-
ing bleak feelings became so intertwined with existential thinking (if not in 
reality, certainly in the popular imagination) that it has been said that exis-
tentialism isn’t so much a philosophical movement as a mood. We don’t 
agree with this assessment, but you can’t dive into the politics of the existen-
tialists without recognizing the towering importance of these events in that 
time and place. When we discuss these events, however, we do so to help 
you understand more clearly what their philosophy means as you read it 
today.
Are Existentialists Political?
The connection between existentialism and politics isn’t a simple one. Pause 
for a moment and consider the type of philosophy existentialism is. Although 
it drives professional philosophers crazy, the truth is that philosophy tends 
to be linked in the popular imagination with the study of religion. For the 
more technical branches of philosophy, nothing could be farther from reality; 
subjects such as logic, ontology, epistemology, and a whole host of other 
long words that sound like they belong in a Harry Potter spellbook have little 
connection to anything like spirituality.

275
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
But existentialism — which can be said to have started, conceptually if not 
chronologically, with the death of God — has closer ties to the study of reli-
gion. It studies broad issues like meaning, purpose, and getting along in a 
world where these things aren’t readily provided. For Christian existentialists 
like Kierkegaard, Marcel, and Buber, separating their faith from their philoso-
phy is hard to do. Likewise, despite their occasional assertions to the con-
trary, the atheistic existentialists’ philosophies are infused with the 
consequences of their rejection of any religious faith.
You’re probably not surprised, then, to hear that the relation between exis-
tentialism and politics isn’t direct or uniform. Like religion, politics seems to 
have a natural connection to philosophy. The sense is that the philosophy 
that informs your basic worldview would naturally affect how you see your 
relation to others and the society you live in. But as with religion, how a 
broad worldview gets translated into concrete action is by no means auto-
matic or obvious. Also like religion, existentialism is a broad tent, with many 
different kinds of adherents under its banner. These differences can lead to 
wildly different expressions in the political realm and in differences in the 
degree to which existentialists even enter this realm. So are the existential-
ists political?
Some are political; some aren’t
When dealing with philosophy and politics, drawing another comparison 
with the realm of religion is useful. Religion has priests and mystics. Priests 
are involved in various ways with other people, whether they’re leading 
sacred rites, doing work for the poor, or arguing with other people about 
what the religion’s rules should be (and then, in all likelihood, working to 
enforce them!). They’re enmeshed in the fabric of their communities and in 
the business of their religious organizations.
Mystics, on the other hand, disengage from the world, go out to the desert, 
and try to have a direct experience of divinity. The thing to remember about 
mystics is that they’re less interested in changing the way the world works 
and more interested in transforming themselves. They generally get involved 
with others only to communicate any wisdom they gain from this disengage-
ment. But even then, their interest is generally to inspire other individuals to 
undergo their own personal transformations and see what they have seen. 
John the Baptist and Buddha are archetypical mystics.
Early existentialists: More mystical than political
Many of the existentialists — particularly the early founders, like Nietzsche 
and Kierkegaard — definitely had a strong strain of mysticism. Nietzsche 
didn’t write most of his books while he was on appointment at a university or 
even when he was within the borders of his native Germany. The hero of his 

276
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
masterpiece, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, is a mystic who descends from the 
mountains to share the wisdom he gains in his solitude. We don’t want to 
overstate their disengagement; both Nietzsche and Kierkegaard write to 
some extent within an academic and philosophical tradition and for a com-
munity that’s part of that same tradition. And certainly, they want to influ-
ence that community and the wider culture with their writing.
But both take serious departures from traditional academic writing. Their 
works are deeply personal. Kierkegaard continually references a tragically 
failed love affair and criticizes mainstream philosophy for not paying suffi-
cient attention to everyday life; Nietzsche often speaks of being misunder-
stood and of writing for only a few isolated individuals who may understand. 
Although they may have an interest in influencing other people and their cul-
ture, this influence is on a deeply personal, spiritual level. When reading 
these writers, you may feel that they’re writing personal letters directly to 
you. If politics enters such writing, it’s many levels removed from their imme-
diate concern, which is how an individual faces the existential situation 
everyone shares.
Later existentialists: Politics comes into play
None of the existentialists is exactly mainstream (after all, the whole move-
ment is a departure from the mainstream), but in the larger sense, many of 
the later writers in the movement were respected members of their univer-
sity faculties or the broader academic community and were deeply involved 
in politics as well. These later writers weren’t the thinkers who discovered 
existentialism on a secluded mountaintop, metaphorically speaking. Instead, 
thinkers like Heidegger and Sartre worked out the details of the earlier, more 
personal, more immediate writers and turned them into a more systematic 
philosophy. In doing so, they couldn’t help but come face to face with 
broader political issues. The French existentialists in particular were 
extremely political. Sartre was no mystic, and his philosophy is especially 
obsessed with action, with doing, and much of this doing in his writing and 
his life is concerned with politics.
Does existentialism lead 
to specific politics?
We outline some of the philosophers’ divergent politics later in this chapter, 
where you discover that the short answer is “no” — existentialism doesn’t 
lead to specific politics. We address the specific allegation that it leads to 
Fascism in the next section. Here, we tell you why it doesn’t lead to any spe-
cific politics. Three related characteristics about existential philosophy tend 
to push it away from backing any one political philosophy:

277
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
 
 Existentialism is more about form than content.
 
 Existentialism is extremely individualistic.
 
 Existentialism denies any ultimate truth that could lead necessarily to 
specific politics.
When your teacher asks you to write a paper, she usually has instructions for 
the form — “Make that ten pages, double-spaced, and be sure you have an 
introduction and a conclusion.” — and a content — “Explain how Heidegger’s 
concept of Dasein relates to the prevailing Zeitgeist of angst in prewar 
Germany as he was writing Being and Time.” Fortunately, the existentialists 
aren’t that specific. They’re concerned with how you understand your situa-
tion and how you do what you do. Unlike traditional religion and morality, 
existentialism tends to put little emphasis on the specifics of what you do or 
should do. Existentialists stress, for example, the importance of living with 
passion (see Chapter 7) and living authentically (see Chapter 5). But these 
concerns relate to the form, not the content, of your actions. The specifics of 
what a person should do are often left open to interpretation and individual 
choice.
The existential philosophers (like Sartre) who do venture into the political 
generally do so only in the most abstract and formal terms (in their philo-
sophical writing, at least). Sartre thinks you should “maximize freedom,” but 
that’s pretty broad. Americans may tell you that democratic capitalism 
affords the most freedom and that the poorest man in their country is a king, 
because he’s master of his own destiny. But a socialist may argue that the 
lower classes are condemned to long work hours, little rewards, and little 
real freedom to choose how they’ll live or what they’ll make of themselves. 
They may argue that the American “king” is a mere “wage slave” who’s alien-
ated from the products of his labor. Only a workers’ revolution that achieves 
economic equality for all can free the workers to fulfill their full potential. 
The form of existentialism’s conclusions leaves open a wide field of political 
content.
From the beginning, existentialism has been an extremely personal and indi-
vidualistic philosophy. This individualistic nature affects existentialism’s 
relationship with politics in two ways:
 
 First, as political as some of the existentialists may have been person-
ally, the philosophy itself is naturally resistant to this move. The focus 
of politics is on groups and living within and among those groups. It’s 
about what systems, rules, and ideals everyone should adopt. Strong 
individualists, and extremely individualistic philosophies, often resist 
the pull of politics toward this group concern.

278
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
 More important, the individualism of existentialism finds expression in 
the belief that individuals do, and should, interpret and navigate the 
world for themselves. So presenting an argument for this or that politics 
is kind of antithetical to the nature of existentialism. Doing so suggests 
that there’s one way of moving through the world, one way of interacting 
with others. But the existentialists don’t have one ultimate truth about 
anything, so they can’t have one final answer to political questions.
So on the whole, existentialism has an apolitical bent and doesn’t lead to a 
specific politics. But a human being, as Aristotle noted, is a political animal. 
Even when the philosophy espoused by the existentialists wasn’t overtly 
political, there were always those on the outside interested in assessing its 
political ramifications. The French existentialists were determined to make 
existentialism political from the inside because for circumstantial and per-
sonal reasons, they each had a great concern for the subject. So despite its 
apolitical bent, existentialism has become intertwined with two political phi-
losophies in particular: Fascism and Communism. In the remaining sections, 
we assess the relationship between the existentialists’ individual philoso-
phies and their real or imagined politics.
Does Existentialism Lead to Evil?
In upcoming sections, we discuss the concrete, historical accusations leveled 
against some existentialists and their politics. The underlying issue may be 
better stated as a question: Does existentialism lead to evil? We address part 
A right way to act politically?
The existentialists say that there’s no ultimate 
meaning, truth, or morality. So you probably 
think they have no ultimately right politics either. 
Strong-willed and opinionated human beings, 
however, can rarely avoid slipping into dogma-
tism, self-righteousness, and the assertion of 
absolute truths, even if their avowed philosophy 
asserts that there are none.
Read Nietzsche, and see whether you don’t 
marvel at the dance he does, bombastically 
condemning this and asserting that, all while 
denying the existence of truth. Most of the exis-
tentialists assert the rightness of their own 
political philosophies (those who have them, at 
least) and the natural connection between 
those philosophies and their fundamental exis-
tential commitments.
Most often, however, existentialists argue that 
their individual politics are consistent with their 
existential commitments, not that they follow 
necessarily from those commitments. That is, 
these individuals tend to defend themselves 
against the charge that they’re contradicting 
themselves — which would be dishonest, and 
very unexistential.
They generally don’t try to assert that anyone 
who accepts their existential philosophy has to 
think this or that way politically. Generally. They 
are, after all, only human.

279
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
of the answer to that question in the section on Nazism, but a significant 
piece of it also rests in the final section on Camus and Sartre, who were 
decidedly not Nazis.
By evil, we have in mind things pretty much everyone agrees are very bad 
things: murder, extreme cruelty, violent oppression. We specifically have in 
mind the way these things are justified and perpetrated on a political level, as 
they were in the regimes of both Hitler and Stalin. The accusation is that the 
existential philosophers and the philosophies they espoused gave support to 
political leaders who were evil in this way. The question of whether existen-
tial philosophy has a natural tendency to support this kind of political evil is 
perfectly reasonable. After all, if it does, you can understand why some 
people would want to hide it from the kids. More to the point, it would under-
mine the claim we have been at pains to advocate: that the goal of existential-
ism is to afford human beings a more successful and healthy means of 
coming to terms with and plotting a course through their lives. If existential-
ism leads to evil, you would be rightly suspicious that either this isn’t the 
goal or that existentialism fails miserably.
But existentialism doesn’t lead to evil any more than religion does. The latter 
has perhaps been more widely abused and twisted to justify atrocities than 
any other form of human endeavor, inquiry, or expression. The sad fact is 
that human beings, whatever their religious or philosophical bent, have a 
tendency to involve themselves in evil and to search for whatever method is 
most ready at hand to justify that evil. Ironically, humanity’s best intentions 
and highest aspirations are often what lead us astray. It’s true that existential 
philosophy (usually in misunderstood form) has been used to justify evil. It’s 
also true that with the best of intentions, existential philosophers (particu-
larly Sartre) have danced with the Devil in hopes that something good would 
come of it. But as we argue in the preceding section, existentialism as a phi-
losophy has no particular political bent in itself. It is what people sometimes 
use it for, as with any human idea, that sometimes leads to misery.
Real and Imaginary Flirtations 
with Nazism
In 1933, a gang of violent thugs gained control of the nation of Germany and 
quickly started institutionalizing a mythology they had created around their 
charismatic leader, their race, and the nation they claimed to be saving. To 
serve their needs, they co-opted every facet of German history and culture 
that they could co-opt, and destroyed or covered up everything they couldn’t 
co-opt. This maelstrom of mythologizing and propaganda sucked in the 
thought of two of existentialism’s greatest thinkers: Friedrich Nietzsche and 
Martin Heidegger. Critics often attack or simply dismiss the thoughts of these 
two thinkers on the basis of their alleged connection to the most hated move-
ment in Western civilization.

280
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
But the issue is deeper and broader than this alleged historical connection 
with Nazism. Existentialism is often seen as a godless philosophy that naturally 
leads to evil. For two of its greatest thinkers to be supporters of Nazism, 
which to many people is the embodiment of evil, would seem to support this 
allegation, especially if their philosophy supports Nazism.
Nietzsche wasn’t a Nazi!
You’ll forgive us for being a bit peevish on this topic, but really, give the guy 
a break. Adolf Hitler formed the Nazi party in 1919; Nietzsche died in 1900, 
after years of mental and physical illness in an asylum. Okay, maybe it isn’t 
quite that simple. Nietzsche generally isn’t charged with literally being a Nazi, 
but some claim that he influenced Hitler and helped inspire his movement, 
that his philosophy naturally leads to Nazism, and/or that he held many of 
the ideals of the Nazis, so he was a Nazi in spirit if not in name, and he glori-
fied in his writings the ideals that the Nazis would later put into practice. 
Some even throw out terms like proto-Fascist or proto-Nazi, which just mean 
that he was an earlier or original version of these unsavory things. We think if 
he’s a proto anything, it’s proto-existentialist.
Nietzsche didn’t influence Hitler
It has been said that Nietzsche was the philosopher of the Third Reich and 
that his philosophy underscored much of the thinking of Hitler and the Nazis. 
This simply isn’t true. There’s no evidence of any such influence or of the 
Nazis taking his thinking particularly seriously.
The connection between Nietzsche and Nazism was largely a creation of his 
sister, Elizabeth Foster-Nietzsche. Through her efforts, Nietzsche became a 
celebrated thinker in Nazi circles, though not necessarily an influential one. 
Elizabeth held extremely conservative, anti-Semitic, and nationalistic views. 
In keeping with these views, she married an avowed anti-Semite. Nietzsche 
hated him.
Unlike Nietzsche, Elizabeth lived well into the 20th century — long enough, in 
fact, to become a Nazi and even meet Hitler. Although she was never particu-
larly close to her brother in life, she took full control of his estate — including 
all his manuscripts and perhaps more important, his public image — after his 
death. Among her more damaging activities were publishing many of 
Nietzsche’s unfinished manuscripts, editing (and even rewriting) them to 
make them more congruent with her own political views and those of the 
Nazis.
But Hitler’s Germany wasn’t much about reading; it was about icons and 
images. It was about reaching back and claiming (read: co-opting) the great-
ness of Germany’s history. By the time of the Nazis, Nietzsche had finally 

281
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
started to receive the recognition he had long been due, and his name was 
added to the list of “great Germans” to which the Nazi party claimed to be 
the heir. Partially due to his sister’s influence and campaigning, Nietzsche 
achieved the dubious distinction of being accorded a special seat at this 
table. To cement the mythological connection between Hitler and this great 
thinker of Germany’s past, Hitler made a trip to the Nietzsche archives (run 
by Elizabeth, naturally) in 1934 and posed for a famous photograph with a 
bust of Nietzsche. In the picture, the Fuehrer stares at the bust in deep and 
serious thought. Nietzsche doesn’t stare back.
But just because the Nazis claimed him, or the picture that his sister pre-
sented of him, doesn’t mean Nietzsche did, or would have, claimed them. 
(More about this in the next section.) More to the point, just because the 
Nazis claimed an affinity with Nietzsche for political ends doesn’t mean they 
read, understood, or really cared about anything he actually said. There’s no 
evidence that Nietzsche had any real influence over Hitler or even that Hitler 
read Nietzsche.
In short, the real connection between Hitler and Nietzsche had more to do 
with propaganda and political maneuvering — both Hitler’s and Elizabeth’s — 
than with ideas. Elizabeth sold the Nazis a bill of goods on her brother so that 
she could profit from it financially and, more important, in terms of her per-
sonal prestige.
All this iconography, posturing, and propaganda were based on the assertion 
of an affinity between the thinking of Hitler and the Nazis and the thinking of 
Nietzsche. Even if you reject the notion that Nietzsche had any real influence 
on the Nazis, asking whether this affinity of ideas really exists is completely 
fair. See the next section for details.
Nietzsche didn’t share Nazi ideals
Here are three general points about Nietzsche that are relevant to the accusa-
tion that his philosophy shares or glorifies Nazi ideals:
 
 Nietzsche is very easy to misinterpret: Nietzsche’s philosophy is loud, 
highly critical, uncensored, and often harsh-sounding. He’s also inten-
tionally opaque, impish, and playful in his writing. Often, his meaning 
can be very different from, even the exact opposite of, what it appears to 
be at first glance. To read Nietzsche out of context or in sound bites is to 
almost guarantee misreading. In today’s society, think of a politician 
who constantly talks from the hip in passionate and uncensored words. 
This kind of person is guaranteed to be shredded by the media and her 
political opponents as they quote bits of her speeches out of context, 
magnify the significance of minor asides, and give the most sinister 
interpretations possible to her words. Nietzsche is like this, except that 
his words are never poorly chosen; rather, he seems to court misread-
ing. Perhaps because he wants to be read carefully or not at all.

282
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
 Nietzsche is fundamentally apolitical: Nietzsche’s writing is concerned 
with the personal and obsessed with the individual and individuality. He 
critiques societies, as he critiques everything else, but his concern with 
them is largely with whether they foster or hinder individuality and per-
sonal greatness. His tone when discussing social or political topics, even 
as he dishes tremendous criticism, is often distant and scientific. History 
is one of Nietzsche’s areas of fascination and expertise, and he often 
looks at such topics from an historical or anthropological viewpoint. But 
it all comes back to individuals: What does what you learn about the 
human species from these cultural investigations tell you about what 
the individual is capable of?
 
 Although Nietzsche isn’t a Nazi, he’s not Mother Teresa or Abe Lincoln 
either: One of coauthor Greg’s philosophy professors once said, “If read-
ing Nietzsche doesn’t disturb you, then you aren’t reading Nietzsche.” 
Nietzsche proclaimed himself an immoralist and an antichrist. Although 
these claims include a certain amount of hyperbole — and impishness — 
you can’t expect the moral terrain to be all warm and fuzzy, or even 
familiar, when you’re reading about Nietzsche. Prepare yourself, because 
here there be monsters!
There isn’t one central accusation against Nietzsche concerning Nazism. The 
accusations don’t come from one central place, and they aren’t centered on 
one particular idea in his philosophy. Bits, pieces, and themes in his philoso-
phy have at various times been accused of having Nazi overtones or worse. 
In the following pages, we review some of the accusations against Nietzsche 
as they relate to specific dimensions of Nazism.
Racism/anti-Semitism/nationalism
Hitler asserted that the Aryan race (basically, Germanic and Scandinavian 
Europeans) was superior to other races and that mixing of the races, either 
culturally or genetically, could only do damage to the superior group. The 
Germans, of course, were considered to be the finest example of the Aryan 
race. Hitler’s racism was particularly anti-Semitic — that is, targeted at 
people of Jewish decent. It was the Jews who were accused of being the 
greatest racial threat to the Aryans. Hitler used the Jews as scapegoats and 
villains to unite and distract the German people with hatred and fear and to 
promote his version of German nationalism.
Nationalism generally indicates a concern with a national identity, usually 
thought of in terms of ethnic or cultural connections. In Hitler’s case, this 
was a belief in the greatness and unity of the German people.
Accusation: Nietzsche believed that many character traits are inherited, and 
he regularly criticized groups of people on racial grounds. He’s particularly 
critical of the Jews and refers to their morality as a “slave morality.”

283
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
This info is all basically true, but
 
 Nietzsche is an almost equal-opportunity offender; he skewers pretty 
much everyone. We say almost because his favorite target is probably 
the Germans, whom he ridicules mercilessly, particularly for their pre-
tensions to superiority. He would’ve found the Nazis’ arrogant national-
ism laughable and inane. Also, he believed the mixing of races was a 
good thing, because each race had its strengths; he wasn’t an advocate 
of racial purity.
 
 Nietzsche had mixed feelings about the Jews, which was typical of 
his attitude toward most things. He had great admiration for the Jews 
and their society. As someone whose philosophy asserts that human 
beings must be creators of value, he saw Jewish society as powerful and 
original. As he saw it in historical terms, they were creators of a morality 
that was vastly influential. Most of his criticism of them was directed 
at the content of this morality, which he saw as being at the heart of 
Christianity, of which he was also very critical. Pretty much every attack 
he made on the Jews, then, was also a criticism of the Christians and by 
extension, his society at large. He had no special animosity toward the 
Jews, and he certainly didn’t see them as inferior.
 
 Nietzsche detested anti-Semites and railed against them regularly. One 
of the major reasons he split from Richard Wagner, one of his early 
idols, was over the latter’s anti-Semitism. It was only Nietzsche’s sister’s 
anti-Semitic warping of her brother’s philosophy that ever gave this 
accusation any traction. Certainly, the source of his viscous feelings 
toward anti-Semites was partially aroused by his deep respect for Jewish 
culture. He also detested anything common, which anti-Semites, unfortu-
nately, were during his time. In the end, however, we like to chalk this 
one up to simple good taste.
Fascism
Fascism generally refers to the confluence of a number of authoritarian 
beliefs, such as totalitarian rule, a disdain for human rights, and an obsession 
with military superiority and police power. These powers are usually said to 
be part of a hypernationalistic and often racist agenda of national unity and 
superiority.
Accusation: Nietzsche was an elitist who was obsessed with greatness and 
with the creation of the Übermensch (or superman). He believed great indi-
viduals go “beyond good and evil” to accomplish their ends. Finally, he had 
utter disdain for Western democracies and their notions of equality and 
egalitarianism.

284
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Again, this accusation is mostly true, but
 
 Fascism tends to be nationalistic and racist, and Nietzsche was anything 
but. (See the previous section for details.)
 
 The Übermensch is largely misunderstood and is more of an individual 
and spiritual goal. (See Chapter 11 for more on this.)
 
 Nietzsche was an elitist, and he believed people should strive to be 
great. His picture of a noble, however, is of someone too busy being 
great, asserting positive values, and slapping herself on the back for 
being so wonderful to really give a lot of thought to criticizing, let alone 
oppressing, the inferior people around her. Nietzsche’s major criticism 
of Judeo-Christianity is that it spends too much time decrying evil and 
making people feel guilt and shame. Indeed, he feels the greatest evil 
someone can do is to cause another shame. No noble, therefore, would 
ever treat the Jews, or anyone else, like the Nazis did. This is certainly 
another source of Nietzsche’s vehement anti–anti-Semitism.
 
 Nietzsche wasn’t a big fan of democracy or equality. He felt very 
strongly that the worst thing a person could be — to her own detriment, 
as well as everyone else’s — is part of the crowd, and he believed 
democracy encourages this. Despite this belief, he never supported any 
particular alternative, and certainly not Fascism.
The cult of power and militarism
At the end of the day, the Nazis believed in one thing: power. Their under-
standing of power was principally the simple brutal application of thuggish 
force. But force wasn’t just something to be used pragmatically. It was some-
thing to be reveled in and glorified, in speech, in action, and in the arts.
Accusation: Nietzsche is obsessed with power and strength and believes that 
all human beings are guided by a will to power.
Here, perhaps more than anywhere else, you can find ample quotes that 
seem to support the accusation. That’s probably because there’s some truth 
to it. Nietzsche spent much of his life in a sickly and weak state, and like it 
does with many in that condition, strength and power became a bit of an 
obsession with him. But the will to power is no more a political thesis than 
Darwin’s survival of the fittest. (See Chapter 11 for more on the will to 
power.)
For Nietzsche, this obsession with power, like most of his obsessions, was 
ultimately turned inward. He ultimately came to glorify the spiritual strength 
of the individual, not the simple-minded brutality of Fascists like the Nazis. 
Ultimate power is discovered and exercised in self-overcoming, not the abuse 
of others.

285
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
Romanticism
The story Hitler told about racial superiority and nationalism included 
romanticism about nature and about the German people. He said that what’s 
natural is good, and that the Germans, particularly the German farmers, were 
the most natural of peoples. Although Hitler utilized technology, particularly 
military technology, to brilliant and terrible effect, he constantly admonished 
people to be on guard against moving too far from their rural roots. He glori-
fied natural man and derided the Jews as not only an inferior but also an 
unnatural people.
Accusation: Nietzsche, like the Nazis, glorified nature and insisted that human 
beings should accept their basest nature rather than accept the limits 
imposed by a civilized society. This leads to a barbarous politics.
Although romanticism is hardly the greatest of the Nazi crimes, it’s not one 
Nietzsche is really guilty of at all. As an existentialist, Nietzsche believed you 
must accept what is and create value out of what you have instead of assign-
ing it to some heavenly other world (see Chapter 3 for more on this idea). No 
existentialist believes nature is inherently good, because no existentialist 
believes nature is inherently anything. Nature is simply what is; it’s the situa-
tion you live in. Because the existentialists believe your project is to create 
value, they believe your project is to create value in the natural world — 
because that’s all there is. Nietzsche doesn’t glorify nature. He simply refuses 
to start where so many other religions and philosophies start — with the 
rejection of the natural.
This acceptance of nature would lead inevitably to a barbarous politics if bar-
barism is all that humans, as natural creatures, were capable of. If people are 
nothing but voracious, wanton, little id monsters, hungry to loose their dark-
est desires on the world, something like Nazism is probably going to be the 
result. But if that’s true, if that’s what people are, no philosophy can lead to 
anything but barbarism! But Nietzsche doesn’t just embrace the darkest pas-
sions; he embraces everything natural within you, including your will, your 
self-control, and your highest aspirations. The French, who were far more 
political than Nietzsche, later approached the problem of political terror with 
a humanistic attitude firmly grounded in Nietzsche: All problems are human 
problems, and any solution possible must be a human solution.
Return to the past
Like many demagogues, Hitler won over supporters by touting a return to a 
mythical, glorious past. He made much of the greatness of Germany through-
out history and strove to connect himself and his movement at every oppor-
tunity to great figures of Germany’s past.
Accusation: Much like the Nazis, Nietzsche glorified Greek culture and advo-
cated a return to the Greek way of thinking. Such backward-looking thinking 
leads to ultraconservative politics, fearful of the present and the future.

286
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
All existentialists thought something had gone awry in philosophy and that it 
had lost touch with real life and real living. Nietzsche especially found great 
wisdom and nobility when looking back at the Greeks. But as with everything 
else, his feelings were mixed. Nietzsche’s project was really to mine every-
thing for the good that could be found in it. It was never to walk in lockstep 
with any set of ideas — past, present, or future. This individuality of spirit is 
actually what makes Nietzsche and the later existentialists particularly resis-
tant to the “charms” of Fascism and Totalitarianism.
Murder, cruelty, and horror
Murder, cruelty, and horror are the real legacy of Hitler’s regime, its true 
meaning, and the real taint that hangs over those associated in any way with 
his reign. If existentialism is guilty of supporting these things, it’s null and 
void as a philosophy to all civilized people.
Accusation: An immoralist, someone guilty of the excesses described earlier, 
such as his elitism and his obsession with power, is capable of supporting 
anything, including the horrors of the Holocaust.
Claiming that an immoralist could support such things may include a certain 
truth, but it simply isn’t true that Nietzsche did. Furthermore, based upon all 
the points we make throughout this section and the personal, positive nature 
of his philosophy, we assert that he would not. Nietzsche simply isn’t guilty of 
the excesses he’s accused of. At least, he’s not guilty in the simple-minded 
way his accusers generally consider him to be. This is significant, because 
it’s often stated that such untenable attitudes are the natural result of an 
existentialist viewpoint. The fact that even Nietzsche, the immoralist, and the 
other existentialists resoundingly reject such ideals suggests that you must 
look elsewhere for the source and justification of the Nazi horrors. It also sug-
gests that no necessary connection links existentialism to the acceptance of 
repugnant behaviors and belief systems like Nazism.
Accepting existentialism doesn’t necessarily mean someone will accept 
horrid moral systems or behaviors like Nazism. Unfortunately, accepting exis-
tentialism doesn’t necessarily mean someone won’t accept a horrid moral 
system like Nazism.
The Heidegger problem: 
A Nazi in the family
In a way, Heidegger and Nietzsche present opposite cases. Nietzsche, espe-
cially in small doses, sounds like he could be a Nazi. He shares Hitler’s love of 
colorful rhetoric, and he often rails violently at his enemies. But he was the 

287
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
farthest thing from a Nazi (see the earlier section “Nietzsche wasn’t a Nazi!” 
for a fuller discussion of Nietzsche’s “Nazism”). Reading Martin Heidegger 
(1889–1976) is more like reading a Chinese dictionary in German. His intellect 
is dizzying, his philosophy dense and highly abstract, and the connection 
between that philosophy and everyday life unclear. Yet Heidegger was, in 
the most literal sense, an active member of the Nazi party during Hitler’s 
Germany.
This membership has posed a problem for people who study Heidegger. 
Should they dismiss this great thinker and his philosophy? Should they view 
that philosophy as tainted and noxious?
Partially because Heidegger’s philosophy is so dense, the exact significance 
or meaning that his Nazism has on his philosophy has never been clear. Also, 
philosophers and academics are always huge fans of anything so immensely 
complex that no one seems to fully comprehend what it means. They’re kind 
of like Bob Dylan fans.
Heidegger has always had a huge contingent of followers and defenders who 
are quick to say, “Yeah, but he wasn’t really a Nazi” or “Yeah, but it doesn’t 
show up in his work.”
The Heidegger problem actually breaks down into two sets of questions:
 
 What was the extent of Heidegger’s involvement in the Nazi party? How 
much of its philosophy did he agree with? Did his views on Nazism ever 
change? How much of a Nazi was he?
 
 How did Nazism relate to Heidegger’s existential philosophy? Did 
Nazism influence his thought? Does his philosophy naturally lead 
to Nazism?
The first set of questions seeks to determine to what extent Heidegger is 
guilty of anything and the second to determine to what extent the man can be 
distinguished from his philosophy.
Not a Nazi in name only
Heidegger was a Nazi in a fairly robust sense. He never committed any atroci-
ties, and he wasn’t a concentration-camp guard, but his involvement in the 
party wasn’t trivial either. For years, that involvement was philosophy’s dirty 
little secret, generally swept under the rug. As he and his supporters told the 
tale, Nazism was a youthful mistake, something Heidegger was never that 
involved in. He was also often excused by virtue of the fact that he lived in a 
one-party state where everyone who wanted to advance joined the party. 
Really, the story went, he wasn’t guilty of much more than living in Germany 
in the 1930s and 1940s.

288
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
But Heidegger wasn’t just some clerk. On May 27, 1933, he was inaugurated 
as the rector, or leader, of Freiburg University. This was four months after 
Hitler came to power and 26 days after Heidegger joined the Nazi party. He 
wasn’t a high-level party insider, but he was viewed as loyal, right-thinking, 
and acceptable. His appointment was part of the reshuffling the Nazis did to 
put people they could count on in positions of power.
And Heidegger turned out to be perfectly adequate in that capacity. Starting 
with his speech at the inauguration, he established a pattern of rhetorically 
supporting the regime and its legitimacy. At the inauguration, he gave a stir-
ring and impassioned speech about the spiritual decay he saw in his country 
and in the world, and the need for leaders — like himself and the Fuehrer — 
to lead first the nation and then the world out of this decline. By all accounts, 
Heidegger believed what he was saying and believed that the university, as 
well as the nation, needed strong leadership.
Heidegger would provide that leadership in the way political appointees gen-
erally do, by enforcing the policies and mandates of their patrons. Although 
he seemed to take pains to protect the positions and privileges of some of his 
professors — including some Jewish professors — he generally acted as a 
Nazi tool to gradually weed out Jewish influence and the influence of “bad 
politics.” In this regard, he acted as both a bureaucratic enforcer of Nazi 
policy and as a stool pigeon, reporting on the political associations of others.
Not an advocate of bloodshed
The best that can be said of Heidegger’s involvement in the Nazi party is that 
it ends here. In fact, Heidegger resigned his post in the summer of 1934, after 
what’s often called the “Night of the Long Knives,” when the Nazis killed 
hundreds of Hitler’s political enemies in one night. (Think of the end of 
The Godfather on a massive scale.)
Evidently Heidegger could stand for dictatorship, exclusion, and the ruining 
of reputations and careers, but not bloodshed. We say evidently because 
Heidegger almost never spoke of these matters, which makes their signifi-
cance even harder to assess.
In a 1966 interview, he spoke briefly about that time, but he never mentioned 
the Holocaust or gave any indication that he regretted or withdrew his sup-
port of the Nazi party. Heidegger was ever the obscure academic, and the 
only criticism he leveled at the Nazis was abstract and philosophical. (The 
interview is discussed further in the following section.)
Loose connections between his philosophy and Nazism
No argument has ever clearly made the case that Heidegger’s existential phi-
losophy was influenced by, or led him to, his Nazi sympathies. Of course, 
with a philosophy as dense and abstract as Heidegger’s, making that case is 
hard for two principal reasons:

289
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
 
 The more dense a philosophy is, the more interpretations it is subject 
to. One of those interpretations may lead to Nazism, but which one? And 
is it the right one? Just because you know Heidegger joined the party 
doesn’t mean you know exactly why he did it or what philosophical justi-
fication he may or may not have seen in his own philosophy.
 
 The more abstract the philosophy is, the farther removed it is from 
everyday life, and the harder it is to say what consequences that philos-
ophy has in the real world.
The only certain connection was revealed by Heidegger himself in an inter-
view with the magazine Der Spiegel in 1966. There, he states:
. . . I see the task in thought to consist in general, within the limits allotted 
to thought, to achieve an adequate relationship to the essence of technol-
ogy. National Socialism, to be sure, moved in this direction. But those 
people were far too limited in their thinking to acquire an explicit rela-
tionship to what is really happening today and has been underway for 
three centuries.
Heidegger believes technology alienates human beings from their being, from 
what they most essentially are. Perhaps, then, Nazism’s romanticism and the 
promise of a return to the past (both covered in the preceding section on 
Nietzsche) were what appealed to him. Certainly, the Nazis mastered technol-
ogy while extolling the virtues of a simpler life, and Heidegger may have seen 
in them some way of mastering a relationship with technology that doesn’t 
alienate people.
The point is, though, that Heidegger sees the Nazi movement from a bird’s-
eye, ivory-tower view. His biggest concern is not the Holocaust, but the 
philosophy of technology. At a human level, this is damning to Heidegger. 
But when you look at him as a philosopher, this info suggests two points:
 
 He took the most abstract portions of Nazi philosophy and ideals con-
cerning how people would live in the new order very seriously — 
perhaps even more seriously than the Nazis took it themselves.
 
 Whatever connections there may be between Nazism and Heidegger’s 
philosophy, they occur at an extremely abstract level. The level is so 
abstract that the connection between his philosophy and the day-to-day 
atrocities of the Nazis is tenuous at best.
These points don’t defend Heidegger or his philosophy, but they do suggest 
that if his philosophy and Nazism have an insidious relationship, it is by no 
means clear and direct or one-to-one. In the end, critics generally agree upon 
the extent of Heidegger’s involvement in the Nazi party, but they still hotly 
contest the final significance of that involvement for his philosophy. Now that 
you have some necessary context, we let you decide the taint it leaves on the 
man and on his brand of existentialism.

Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Viva la Revolution! The French Left
Of all the existentialists, the French were by far the most outspokenly politi-
cal. If you were living in Paris in the 1930s and 1940s, it would’ve been hard 
not to be. Politics for the French wasn’t merely something you got involved 
in; it was something of a blood sport. The leading existential thinkers — 
Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Albert 
Camus — were all involved in one way or another with the largely Leftist 
political scene of French intellectuals.
In this section, we focus on Sartre and Camus. Merleau-Ponty was an impor-
tant figure at the time but is somewhat less influential to American thought. 
The best way to understand the politics of Sartre and Camus is first to review 
their place in the cultural and political world in Paris. Then we discuss the 
largely political feud that erupted between them and how it relates to both 
their divergent politics and philosophies.
The French political scene
Existentialism came of age in Paris in a cultural and political environment that 
most people can’t quite imagine. The major French thinkers in the movement 
lived at a time and in a place where being a famous philosopher, novelist, or 
political thinker was like being a movie star or a rock star. Try to imagine if 
instead of covering Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, People magazine covered 
people like John Irving, Toni Morrison, Henry Kissinger, and the authors of 
that important new philosophical work Existentialism For Dummies. Now imag-
ine that instead of being judged on their weight or fashion sense, these celeb-
rities were judged repeatedly, publicly, and ruthlessly (often by one another!) 
on things like originality of thought, use of irony, and their politics. Finally, 
imagine these big, deep, serious thinkers having skins as thin and egos as big 
as any Hollywood movie star. Britney and K-Fed have nothing on the battles 
these people could wage on one another.
Paris back in the day had something else in common with Hollywood: It was a 
relatively small space where all the big names regularly ran into one another, 
whether in person or in the major journals, magazines, and newspapers they 
all read, edited, or published articles in. The major French existentialists all 
knew one another. The superstars, in fact, were quite close. Simone de 
Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre were lifelong companions, though in keeping 
with their beliefs about freedom, they never married or made any exclusive 
commitment to each other. Sartre, de Beauvoir, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty 
edited a political journal, Les Temps Modernes (literally, Modern Times), 
together for many years. Sartre and Albert Camus were close friends for 
years, having similar interests in philosophy, literature, the theater, and poli-
tics. Indeed, even before they met, they had read and written reviews of each 
other’s work.

291
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
In fact, Sartre first became seriously interested in politics because of Camus. 
Sartre had always been vaguely Leftish in the way academics of his time were 
almost expected to be, but he wasn’t seriously committed or involved. This is 
somewhat ironic and tragic, because Sartre would later accuse his friend 
Camus of, among other things, not being political enough.
As with today’s American society, the Left in existential Paris wasn’t com-
pletely unified. Certain issues, however, dominated everyone’s thinking. 
These issues are referenced repeatedly in the writings of the existentialists at 
the time — usually in a way that assumes you know the context. Now you 
will!
 
 Nazism and the French occupation: The disturbing thing about both of 
these things, besides the obvious horrors they had inflicted, was that 
ordinary people had to one degree or another accepted them. The 
Germans elected the Nazis to power, and French collaborators aided 
and abetted the German occupation of France from 1940 to 1944. Some 
had certainly collaborated at gunpoint (which garnered little sympathy), 
but many had seemingly done so out of a desire for political or eco-
nomic gain (which garnered even less sympathy). The middle class 
(or bourgeoisie, as the writings and translations of the French existen-
tialists almost always refer to it) in particular was accused of rolling 
over very quickly, whether from a lack of backbone or more insidious 
motives. In either case, people on the Left widely believed that the 
middle class had abdicated any claim to leadership in the society 
because of these actions. Living through such times made it exceedingly 
clear to the existentialists that political choices have real and often 
severe consequences. This made political involvement seem all the 
more essential and immediate in its relevance to everyday life.
 
 Support of the working class: The (alleged) involvement of the middle 
class in the French occupation discredited its people and led to a fairly 
vibrant and radical Left that almost universally supported the interests 
and liberation of the working class instead. This support was also due in 
part to the immense impact at the time of Marxist philosophy on the 
intellectual community.
 
 Marxism: Today, Karl Marx is known mostly as the inspiration for a 
series of revolutions that led to brutal dictatorships all over the world. 
But Marx was also a philosopher who analyzed the effects of capitalism 
on human beings and has great influence on thinkers of all kinds to this 
day. Marx argued persuasively that the exploitation and oppression of 
the working class severely limit and threaten human freedom for all 
people. For the existentialists, particularly for the French and most par-
ticularly for Sartre, freedom is a critically important dimension of human 
life. So if Marx is correct, any philosophy concerned with human free-
dom, like Sartre’s, must be highly suspicious of Capitalism and must 
support Communism. (For more on Sartre and freedom, see Chapter 8.)

292
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
 The cold war: The recognition of the cold war to come starts in French 
writing even before Hitler’s defeat is finalized. For the Left, the United 
States is often seen as imperialistic, opportunistic, and threatening to 
French independence (which had already received a blow in the occupa-
tion). Stalin and the Russian Communists were a tough issue; they claimed 
to be Marxists and to support the workers (and human freedom), but 
Stalin gives Hitler a run for his money in the ol’ “epitome of evil” contest.
 
 The end of colonialism: In the decades after World War II, nations that 
had traditionally been “possessions” of powerful European countries like 
Britain and France started declaring their independence. Not everyone 
was willing to accept this very quickly, however, and not every revolution-
ary was a pacifist like Gandhi. Many of the revolutions that followed were 
violent and often Communist in orientation. Before the U.S. Vietnam war, 
for example, came the French Vietnam War, which was similarly contro-
versial and divisive, starting as a war to overthrow French colonial rule.
Which Left is right? Sartre 
chooses Communism
Politically and to a large extent philosophically, Sartre was first and foremost 
a devout Marxist. He fully believed that humanity’s freedom rested upon the 
triumph of the working class. His love of freedom and hatred of all forms of 
oppression led him to be a virulent supporter of anticolonial movements 
across the globe but especially those movements that resisted French colo-
nial occupations, such as those in Vietnam and Algeria. All these positions, 
along with the ascendancy of McCarthyism in the United States in the 1950s, 
led Sartre to be fairly consistently critical of, and even hostile to, the United 
States; its uncontrolled form of Capitalism; and, as he saw it, its imperialism.
His position toward Communism and the Soviet Union, however, was com-
plex and stormy. Most Communist parties, and particularly France’s, saw 
themselves as allied with the Soviet Union and — in his day — with Stalin. 
This alliance put Sartre in a bit of a quandary. Many Leftists, including Camus 
and eventually Merleau-Ponty, fled from any relationship with such an 
oppressive regime. But Sartre was certain that Communism was the party of 
the working class, which Sartre supported unconditionally, at least in theory. 
But in practice, the party of the working class was in league with the Devil. 
Further, in a cold-war environment, you had to take sides: Capitalist (imperi-
alist) democracy or Communist dictatorship. What’s a good Marxist to do?
Sartre’s response was threefold:
 
 Adopt a means-ends stance: If the eventual triumph of the working class 
and the liberation of humanity depend upon a period of authoritarian 
and oppressive rule, well, so be it, as long as this is done in service of 

293
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
that eventual goal. History moves by violence. The only question is “On 
which side will you fight?”
 
 Adjust the level of support as appropriate: Sartre’s relationship with 
the Communists was extremely stormy. He had a violently on-again, off-
again relationship with various Communist parties, and he was never 
actually a member of France’s Communist Party. He felt the party was 
too uncritically pro-Soviet. Philosophically, he was always with the 
party, but despite his means-ends stance, he had little real stomach for 
many of its concrete actions.
 
 Work for change from the inside: Although Sartre was never really an 
insider per se, he believed the only way to criticize the actions of the 
Soviet Union and the Communists was as a Communist sympathizer and 
as a supporter of their ultimate aims. And to his credit, he did criticize 
the actions of the Soviet Union and the Communists, vehemently at 
times, from within the family, so to speak. He was always an anti–anti-
Communist, opposing anyone who would oppose the Communists on 
general principle rather than condemning the actions of particular 
Communists at particular times (as he himself did).
In the harsh social and political climate of Parisian intellectuals, this position 
was guaranteed to bring trouble. Sartre got it, from both sides. The 
Communists (never the most understanding of critics) accused him of every-
thing from political quietism to being a Fascist puppet of the Americans, while 
those on the more moderate Left (including some of his closest friends) 
accused him of condoning atrocities. Because he wavered between attacking 
and praising the Communists and the Soviet Union, both sides had ample evi-
dence on which to base their criticisms. With the best of humanitarian inten-
tions, Sartre tried to walk a middle path — being pro-Communist but not 
uncritically so.
Camus rejects violence
It is better to be wrong by killing no one than to be right with mass graves.
—Albert Camus
Camus was, in many respects, the conscience of existentialism. Decent and 
deeply compassionate, he is rarely placed on the list of philosophers held up 
to discredit existentialism or tie it to political atrocities. Perhaps this is why 
his philosophy is not particularly well known. He edited a journal called 
Combat during World War II and was active in the French Resistance to 
German occupation. Later, he protested oppression as propagated by both 
the Right (such as the French treatment of the Algerians) and the Left (such as 
the Stalinist regime in Russia). Despite his involvement in such movements 
and his deep commitment to political action, Camus spent most of his life as a 
pacifist. Though he often sympathized with rebellions, particularly against 
Totalitarian regimes, he rejected violent means of attaining political ends.

294
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
The roots of his pacifism can be seen in his version of existential philosophy. 
It rested primarily on two points:
 
 Death is the ultimate injustice. Whatever evils the current political situ-
ation is guilty of, and whatever benefits are promised by revolt, to alter 
the situation through violence is to involve yourself in the greatest of 
injustices, and thereby you only increase the injustice in the world.
 
 No ideal is worth fighting for. To fight against one political situation is 
to fight for another and the ideals that underlie that system. But Camus 
rejects the absolute assurance in any set of values that advocates of 
rebellion say make the fighting defensible.
For Camus, the only way to defeat the absurd situation human beings find 
themselves in is to embrace it — to accept the fact that there is no meaning. 
You can assert individual values, but you must remember that any objective 
values are myths. The problem with revolutionary ideologies, according to 
Camus, is that they must start with presenting a set of values as somehow 
objectively more correct than those of the status quo. The result is the cre-
ation of a value that’s not only worth dying for, but also worth killing for. 
Camus thinks that after you make this turn, the inevitable result is that the 
injustices you were fighting against become acceptable in defense of the new, 
supposedly more just and righteous regime. In reality, what all revolutions do 
is replace one absolute ideal with another. In the words of the British rock 
band The Who, “Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.” The true absurd-
ist refuses to endorse or fight for any absolute ideal.
Camus, then, used his political activism not to erect a vision of a more per-
fect world, but to eliminate injustice wherever he saw it in this one. He 
focused his energies on opposing both violent oppression and violent resis-
tance. He advocated treating people with compassion and respect, which he 
saw as being at odds with oppressive occupations of both the colonial and 
Communist powers. This set him at odds with many on the Left, who tended 
to be more narrowly, and often violently, opposed to the colonial powers 
while often turning a blind eye to the oppression of the Communists. One of 
those he came into direct conflict with was Jean-Paul Sartre.
Politics of liberation versus politics of life
Sartre and Camus met at a dress rehearsal for one of Sartre’s plays. They 
became fast friends, but fewer than ten years later, largely political tensions 
between them exploded into a rift that would last the rest of their days.
In 1951 Camus published his philosophical essay The Rebel. The Rebel was 
many things: a meditation on murder; an attempt to develop an ethics; and, 
most important, an indictment of violent revolutions like those being waged 
by Communists all over the globe at the time. Sartre’s journal Les Temps 

295
 Chapter 12: Fear and Loathing in Existential Politics
Modernes wrote a damning review, which led to a bitter exchange of letters, 
published in the journal, between Sartre and Camus. The flap over The Rebel 
brought out differences between the two men that had been bubbling for 
some time. Some of the chief issues:
 
 Camus believed Sartre blindly and uncritically followed both Marxism 
and the Communists.
 
 Camus thought Sartre condoned murder, terror, and Totalitarianism in 
the name of history.
 
 Sartre accused Camus of quietism, an unwillingness to engage in the bat-
tles for justice he saw being waged around the world. He accused Camus 
of retreating from a world that he saw as irredeemably absurd.
 
 Sartre accused Camus of not supporting anticolonial rebellions, such as 
those being waged in Vietnam and Algeria. Camus, he thought, was far 
too accepting of the status quo of traditional political oppression.
The impetus for these differences has many sources, including differences in 
the way the two think about Marxism. In this section, we stick to the way in 
which these positions stem from and illuminate differences in their existen-
tial positions.
One of the central differences between their versions of existentialism is in 
the emphasis each gives in explaining the source of absurdity in life. For 
Sartre, the meaninglessness of life comes from human origins (see Chapter 8 
for more on this idea). People are born as nothing, with no purpose, and with 
no meaning to their existence; going forward, they must create meaning, and 
so create themselves. For Sartre, the tragedy of life starts at its inception. 
Only through action can you “redeem” your life. You must strive to overcome 
this nothingness through action, and that action must be directed at enhanc-
ing human freedom — your own and that of others.
For Camus, the great tragedy of life, what makes it truly absurd, is that it ends. 
What makes life meaningless is that human projects ultimately fail because 
people don’t live to see and partake in what becomes of them. Death, then, 
is the great injustice of life, and Camus asserts that you can make no excuse 
for partaking in it — for partaking in murder. By committing murder, the 
Communists weren’t freeing anyone; they were condemning people to death 
on the basis of an ideal that was as ultimately meaningless and absurd as any 
other. As an existentialist, Sartre should have known better.
Sartre wasn’t buying this idea. He felt that Camus’s excuses represented a 
foul form of cowardice and, worse, dishonesty. For him, violence and conflict 
are part of the human situation. They’re the conditions in which you must 
make your choices. If that’s the reality, the choice isn’t to fight or not to fight, 
but to decide on which side you’ll fight. Sartre was determined to fight on the 
side of the working class and on the side of human liberation; to him, the 
status quo threatened this side.

296
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Each, then, thought the other guilty of “bad faith” — of denying his own free-
dom to choose another path by denying the reality of his situation.
 
 According to Camus, Sartre was erecting a false absolute (for existential-
ists, all absolutes are false) and using it to justify murder and oppression.
 
 According to Sartre, Camus was dishonestly denying the effectiveness of 
action and the reality that he already lived in a violent world of oppres-
sion. Hence, Camus accepted and refused to oppose the murder and 
oppression that were already present.
Each position has some truth as well as a lot of falsehood. The simple fact is 
that although neither was as unwavering as the other thought he should be, 
each struggled with the issues the other raised. As we discuss in the previous 
section, Sartre never fully joined the Communist movement, for all the rea-
sons Camus criticized it. And although Camus refused to support violent 
insurrection, he was a tireless political activist. Appropriately enough, for 
one who thinks the injustice of life is grounded in the death sentence every-
one faces, one of his chief activities was his opposition to the death penalty.

of Philosophical Thought
In This Chapter
 Understanding existentialism’s relationship to modern philosophy
 Exploring the difference between existentialism and postmodernism
 Seeing how existentialism is still relevant today
M
ost of the chapters in this book attempt to tell you who the existen-
tialists were, what they believed, and what existentialism is. In this 
chapter and the next, we follow up with existentialists and answer the ques-
tion, “Whatever happened to them?” Or, rather, whatever happened to their 
philosophy? In the next chapter, we discuss the huge and enduring impact 
existentialism has had on the study of psychology. In this chapter, we stay 
closer to its roots. Existentialism, as we present it, is first and foremost a phi-
losophy. It’s an important contribution to a discussion of the human condi-
tion that’s been going on in Western society since Socrates and Plato started 
it in fifth- and fourth-century Athens.
In the sections that follow, we explain the state of modern philosophy and 
where existentialism fits in. We start by examining how it gets on with the 
dominant strains of today’s mainstream philosophical thought (hint: not 
well). We follow by examining how existentialism has found new life in the 
philosophies that have sprung up to detail and take up arms against the 
plight of the oppressed.
Existentialism’s Run in the 20th Century
When the works of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche gave birth to existentialism in 
the 19th century, existentialism was largely ignored and dismissed as the 
fringe writings of two men who weren’t doing real philosophy. At best it 

298
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
seemed more literary than philosophical; at worst it seemed like the ravings 
of madmen. In the 20th century, existentialism became respectable, among 
academics at least, after thinkers like Heidegger and Sartre wrote nice, long, 
systematized works about the philosophy that aimed at discrediting all sys-
tems. After a brief, meteoric rise in popularity among professional eggheads, 
artists, and even the wider public, existentialism seemed to disappear from 
the face of the culture. Although few thinkers ever embraced the character-
ization of “existentialist” themselves, for a time, many of them were charac-
terized that way with some justice by others, and existentialism, its impact, 
and its meaning were hot topics of conversation.
Around the 1960s, however, the movement (if it ever was one) started to wane. 
After writing his magnum opus of 1927, Heidegger continued to work quietly. 
Although Being and Time continued to be vastly influential, Heidegger’s 
involvement with the Nazi party (see Chapter 12) marginalized him as a philo-
sophical personality after World War II. Albert Camus died in 1960. Jean-Paul 
Sartre, while still immensely important and respected, had his best work 
behind him at this point. And Simone de Beauvoir became better known and 
more influential for writing The Second Sex, and as the grand dame of the 
growing feminist movement, than as an existentialist.
After the fanfare died down, existentialism seemed to go away as a significant 
philosophical movement. Although many of its thinkers remained important 
and were mined for various contributions to the movements that followed, 
existentialism became to some extent persona non grata, an unwelcome and 
occasionally embarrassing member of the philosophical family. Existentialism 
has returned to its outsider roots and is questioned repeatedly for its bona 
fides as a philosophy.
Existentialism and Modern Philosophy: 
A Strained Relationship
Philosophy itself took an interesting turn around the time the existentialists 
started making themselves known. In the section immediately following, we 
examine the split that occurred between, roughly speaking, British and 
American philosophy and the philosophy of the European continent and 
where existentialism fits in to that split. The philosophy that developed on 
the Continent is generally known as, appropriately enough, Continental 
philosophy, and the British-American version is generally called analytic 
philosophy. We examine existentialism’s relation to each in turn following this 
section.

 Chapter 13: Existentialism and Other Schools of Philosophical Thought
Two branches of modern philosophy: 
Analytic and Continental
Around the 19th century, the philosophies of the European continent veered 
off from the direction of that of British and American philosophy. Or they 
kept going and the Brits and Americans veered off course, depending on your 
point of view. Because this is a book on existentialism and not modern phi-
losophy, we don’t dwell on the host of reasons how or why this occurred. We 
just attempt to give you an understanding of how the two philosophies, as 
they were when existentialism came about, differ and where existentialism 
fits in.
When Sir Isaac Newton wrote Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy in 
the 17th century, it’s no exaggeration to say everything changed. Newton 
showed that the entirety of the physical universe could be understood with 
precise and mathematical certainty by human reason. Thinkers like Copernicus 
and Galileo had been giants, but it was largely Newton and those inspired by 
him who started the scientific revolution and made it an unstoppable and 
undeniable force. The major philosophers of the 18th century tried to emulate 
his rigor and systematic style as they approached traditional questions of 
knowledge, ethics, and the nature of the universe.
This attempt to be more scientific in the pursuit of philosophy resulted in the 
following two basic reactions during the 19th century:
 
 In Britain and America, the scientific instinct was strong, and philoso-
phers went farther and farther in their attempts to be as rigorous and 
objective as the hardest of hard scientists. Philosophy became more and 
more concerned with logic, which is basically the science of making 
rational arguments and the language they’re couched in as precise and 
objective as mathematics. Many philosophers in this tradition, the ana-
lytic tradition, have seen philosophy as little more than a secondary 
subdivision of science, working on small problems on the fringes. Like 
the science it tries to emulate, it has become more and more technical, 
more and more specialized, and more and more removed from everyday 
experience. Even when it deals with more human topics, such as ethics 
or political science, it does so at a great distance, treating human beings 
as abstract rational agents rather than three-dimensional persons.
 
 On the European continent, there was a backlash against this type of 
thinking and against the pretensions of reason. Philosophy became 
more and more about unmasking these pretensions, about rejecting the 
scientific model as both false (because it fails to live up to its own stan-
dards of objectivity) and misleading (because the rational scientific 

300
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
method fails to enlighten people about philosophy’s most important 
subjects: human beings). The reaction on the Continent was so strong 
that the Continentals abandoned the specifically scientific model and 
ultimately rejected the more generally rationalistic bias within philoso-
phy that had held sway to a greater or lesser extent since the time of 
Plato. Continental philosophers adopted, instead, literature as their pri-
mary model. Just as you may interpret a text in high school or college 
English classes, the Continentals tend to see everything — from philo-
sophical and scientific theories to gender, politics, and pop culture — as 
textual and open to interpretation.
 
These two basic reactions are to some extent generalizations. The exact 
nature of the differences is subject to dispute, and the two do overlap in some 
areas (or so we contend!). To get an overall sense of the difference, look at 
Table 13-1. As you do so, think about anything you may know about the exis-
tentialists from this book or elsewhere. Where do you think the existentialists 
fit in? Where does your own personal philosophy of life fit in?

As it turns out, both camps are heading in the same direction more and more 
as time goes by. Both are increasingly focused on the importance of language 
as the medium in which the ideas of all their subjects are conveyed. This 
turn was itself presaged by the existentialists — particularly Nietzsche and 
Heidegger, who both dealt thoroughly with the issue of language and brought 
up many of the problems both camps deal with today.

 Chapter 13: Existentialism and Other Schools of Philosophical Thought
Where existentialism fits in
Where does existentialism fit into the two branches of modern philosophy? 
The short answer is simple: Existentialism is part of Continental philosophy. 
Many of its thinkers are considered giants within that tradition. But what’s 
peculiarly existential about them has often been less influential. Existentialism 
is, in many respects, a return to the philosophy of the ancients, where philos-
ophy started. We discuss this return in greater detail in Chapter 1. There, we 
discuss health, but here, we want to discuss poetry and its relationship to 
existentialism and philosophy as a whole. Poetry is surprisingly crucial to the 
history of philosophy.
When Plato creates his perfect society in The Republic, one of the first things 
he does is throw out the poets. The poets, he says, communicate their ideas 
on a level that’s irrational. They move people to act on the basis of lovely 
speeches, stirring tales, and emotionally involving language. They do so with-
out regard to truth and goodness, and so corrupt society. Reason should 
guide the perfect society, for it and it alone discovers what’s true and can 
guide people to right living.
For 2,000 years, philosophy enforced Plato’s ban, never seeming to recall that 
at the end of The Republic, Plato invites the poets back in — provided, of 
course, that they use their craft to communicate only what’s righteous and 
true. Although Plato was fundamentally a rationalist, a proponent of the 
supremacy and primacy of reason, he was also, far more than most of those 
who followed him, a complete philosopher. He recognized, investigated, and 
addressed all aspects of humanity.
Kant and the limits of reason
One of the 18th-century thinkers who tried to 
emulate Newton was Immanuel Kant, who tried 
to demarcate the line between religion and sci-
ence. You can also call it the line between faith 
and the increasingly expansionist reason. (For 
more on Kant, see Chapter 3.) Kant was the last 
thinker embraced by both branches of philoso-
phy, analytic and Continental. His philosophy is 
sometimes used, in both traditions, as an exam-
ple of the limits of human reason. Perhaps that 
argument is made even better in a story from his 
own life. Kant fell in love only once. He pursued 
a lovely young woman who was evidently open 
to his courtship. Kant hesitated, however. Was 
this the right thing to do? Was this the best 
choice? For months Kant subjected the decision 
to reasoned analysis — weighing the pros and 
cons; doing the relationship calculus; and con-
sidering every financial, social, moral, and 
philosophical consequence. At last he happily 
announced that he had decided that the math 
favored the marriage, and he would propose. 
Unfortunately, by that time his love had accepted 
the proposal of another suitor, and Kant spent 
the rest of his life rationally calculating alone.

302
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
The existentialists tried to invite the poets back in. Like Plato himself, they 
often worked in literary forms, because they wanted to address human beings 
and human life in a complete way, which acknowledges that people are emo-
tional, passionate creatures who desire meaning. Although often described as 
irrationalists, they, like Plato, saw the question of rationality as one of empha-
sis. What they objected to wasn’t rationality, but the pretensions of rationality 
to solve or explain everything. They felt something was being left out.
If nature abhors a vacuum, what Western civilization abhors is a moderate. 
People in Western culture seem to need to see things as black or white. Like 
Plato, existentialism shares much with the more holistic philosophies of the 
East. One way of seeing the split between analytic and Continental philoso-
phy is that the two traditions took opposing attitudes on the place of poetry 
in philosophy.
By not accepting existentialism’s holistic view, the analytics enforced the ban 
in stricter and stricter terms, sticking to logic, science, and the pursuit of 
objective knowledge and truth. In the process, questions that involved human-
ity, emotions, or poetry in the largest sense got pushed to the side. Even 
quintessentially human topics like ethics and politics were tolerated only if 
done in the most abstract, logical, and scientific terms. The Continentals, on 
the other hand, went farther than most (not all) of the existentialists ever 
dreamed and rejected reason entirely. They didn’t just let the poets back in; 
they put them in charge.
 
Although existentialism is part of Continental philosophy, in many respects 
it’s a philosophy without a country. Distinguishing the existentialism from the 
existentialists is important. Thinkers such as Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and 
Heidegger in particular remain influential, but not as existentialists. Whatever 
the influence of these thinkers, something unique and special was lost to phi-
losophy when their followers ceased to be interested in specifically existential 
themes.
Postmodernism: Existentialism’s 
bratty stepchild
The most obvious and most important descendent of existentialism in 
Continental philosophy is postmodernism. Like existentialism, postmodern-
ism is notoriously difficult to define, but we’re doing it anyway. Postmodernism 
starts with the rejection of reason and with the rejection of all supposedly 
objective systems of thought that claim to provide objective truths. The mis-
sion of postmodernism (if we can speak of the mission of a group that defies 
all singular description) includes showing up reason in all its facets, in all its 
pretensions. Postmodernism doesn’t show up reason through rational coun-
terarguments but through a process called deconstruction, which aims at 

303
 Chapter 13: Existentialism and Other Schools of Philosophical Thought
exposing the pretensions of reason for what they are and revealing the arbi-
trariness of not only rational inquiry, but also all interpretations of human 
experience.
The second movement of postmodernism is to go about, tongue thoroughly 
in cheek, reassessing and reinterpreting all human experience, usually with 
the aid of methods taken from historical and anthropological studies and lit-
erary criticism. We say tongue thoroughly in cheek because the concept of 
play is very important to postmodernism. Because there’s no ultimately right 
answer, philosophy is seen as a kind of game. Pursuit of the wisdom through 
knowledge of the true gives way to pursuit of cleverness through the devel-
opment of the novel, the witty, and the innovative.
 
This reinterpretation, however, does have at least one serious goal, which is 
overthrowing oppressive systems of thought and the political systems they 
are said to support. Traditional interpretations were dominant, not only 
because they were accepted by the majority of people, but also because they 
were tied together with systems of oppression with which they were mutually 
reaffirming. Traditional rationalist narratives, it is argued, often share the 
qualities of the power structures they arose to support. They are, then, impe-
rialistic, racist, Totalitarian, and oppressive.
 
This description of postmodernism may sound familiar, and it may sound a lot 
like existentialism (if it doesn’t sound familiar, check out Chapter 3). Well, it 
is . . . and it isn’t. There are certainly similarities, but there’s also a deep 
divide. Read the following sections to get a more detailed understanding of 
their relationship.
Stepchild or stepbrother?
The relationship between existentialism and postmodernism goes to the 
heart of questions like “What is existentialism?” and “Who is an existential-
ist?” Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Heidegger all had a profound influence on 
both existentialism and postmodernism. Their literary method and their 
emphasis upon interpretation and the significance of language gave way very 
naturally to the postmodern movement. As for the tone of postmodernism, 
Nietzsche and Kierkegaard both wrote in playful, elusive styles, which chal-
lenged the reader and left much ambiguous or open to interpretation. Much 
of postmodern writing has stuck to this as the model — if coming up with 
ever new ways of being clever can be called a model, that is!
You could argue, then, that the existentialists and the postmodernists 
descend from the same stock. Both intellectual movements descend from the 
writings of three giants — Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Heidegger — who were 
bigger, collectively and individually, than either movement. Existentialists 
focused on certain themes in their writings, and the postmodernists devel-
oped others. Each movement took its set of themes and marched off in a dif-
ferent, but related, direction. You could say that, but we won’t. When push 

304
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
comes to shove, when you examine how existentialism differs from postmod-
ernism, these three thinkers were first and foremost existentialists because 
they had the same fundamental concerns as the later existentialists. They all 
believed that humanity is in crisis and that a way forward must be found that 
will make authentic, engaged, and fulfilling human life possible. The postmod-
ernists developed ideas the other existentialists missed or left to the side, but 
they removed this crucially important context.
The brats’ rebellion: How they differ
Both existentialism and postmodernism start by challenging reason and 
rational systems that claim to provide answers. The two systems differ mark-
edly in two senses:
 
 The extent and nature of the challenge: Although you can find some 
exceptions (particularly Nietzsche, who was particularly radical in this 
area), the postmodernists generally went farther than the existentialists 
in challenging reason. The existentialists’ primary objection was that 
reason is inadequate to provide for the full panorama of human needs. 
For the postmodernists, the cult of reason is simply false. They consider 
rational inquiry just another form of interpretation, no more valid than 
any other. Further, because reason is tied to dominant systems of 
oppression in postmodern thought, it’s a particularly suspect form of 
interpretation.
 
 Where they go from there: For the existentialists, the death of God, 
reason, and absolute systems is the death of traditional systems of 
meaning. The project then becomes finding new meaning. The postmod-
ernists are unconcerned with meaning, anguish, or forlornness. Human 
beings interpret; that’s what they do. The project simply becomes find-
ing the best, most useful, most interesting interpretations.
These are the two broad differences between the two movements, but there 
are many others. We summarize some of these differences in Table 13-2.

Postmodernists see something staid and pious about existentialism. They 
think it clings somewhat romantically to the interpretations of a bygone era, 
even while challenging them. This is certainly one reason why, although post-
modernism pays homage to certain existential thinkers, interest in the philos-
ophy declined precipitously after the postmodern revolution that started in 
the 1960s. Once again, existentialism became, even within its home countries, 
a philosophy spoken only on the fringes and in the shadows.
Existentialism and American philosophy
With its abstract talk of being and obsession over emotions like anguish and 
forlornness, existentialism is seen by many in the United States and Britain as 
the epitome of Continental excess. Conversely, every complaint that existen-
tialism weighs against science (see Chapter 5) can be applied, almost without 
modification, to the modern analytic philosophy of the English-speaking 
countries. This has made for an interesting split:
 
 In American schools, existentialism is almost universally shunned by 
serious research universities. For philosophers, pursuing this nonsense 
is considered professional suicide. Remember, dear reader, this type of 
nonsense won’t get you hired anywhere — except small teaching col-
leges, where it’s wildly popular, which brings us to our next point.
 
 On the street, it’s another story entirely. People feel as alienated in 
today’s society as ever before. People increasingly sense that their sys-
tems have failed them and that science isn’t helping. Oh, it can provide 
you medicines, and space stations, and iPods, and bullet trains, but all 
the things it shuns, all the things it considers irrational nonsense — 
that’s the good stuff. That’s the stuff people need, and that’s the stuff the 
secular, scientific society seems ill equipped to provide. So walk into 
any bookstore, and you’ll find books by and about Nietzsche, Sartre, 
Camus, and the whole gang.

306
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Existentialism and Philosophies 
of the Oppressed
Although mainstream philosophy has largely relegated existentialism to the 
dustbin of history, existentialism has proved to be fertile ground for a new 
generation of philosophical and theological rebels. Philosophies such as fem-
inism, liberation theology, and (most directly) black existential philosophy 
have mined existential ideas to create unique and powerful new ways of inter-
preting and confronting the world and the oppressive relationships that too 
often characterize it. Existentialism has proved to be relevant to these proj-
ects for many reasons. We feel the most significant reason, however, is that 
existentialism has always been about recognizing and asserting human dig-
nity, especially when that dignity is under fire — when it’s denied, ignored, or 
alienated by political, social, or intellectual systems. This is precisely the 
project of what we refer to collectively as the philosophies of the oppressed.
Different philosophies of oppression, even within the same broad tradition, 
have made use of different aspects of the broad spectrum of existential phi-
losophy. As a whole, however, it’s remarkable just how thoroughly these sys-
tems make use of existentialism, echoing themes such as freedom and 
responsibility; feelings of anguish and alienation; and the importance of the 
concrete, subjective point of view. At the center of all these philosophies are 
the rejection of systems of thought that alienate and objectify, and the reaffir-
mation of human dignity. Many have found within existentialism the tools to 
describe that alienation and to assert that dignity. In the following sections, 
we discuss just a couple of the aspects of existential philosophy that have 
found particular resonance and resurgence in modern philosophies of the 
oppressed.
Alienation and otherness
Racism, sexism, and other forms of cultural and economic oppression have 
often been given legitimacy through tying (either explicitly or covertly) that 
oppressive philosophy to notions of a timeless, objective truth that rein-
forces the notion that this oppression is natural, understandable, or neces-
sary. These false systems of thought put the affected class in a position of 
being, at best, second-class citizens. They become what de Beauvoir has 
called “society’s other” (see Chapter 16). Each person sees the world starting 
from his own perspective and sees any other person as an “other,” outside 
and different from himself. Likewise, the oppressive societies see privileged 
classes — men, whites, the dominant culture — as the starting point, the 
norm. Theirs is the assumptive point of view, whereas the oppressed classes 
take the role of the alien other.

307
 Chapter 13: Existentialism and Other Schools of Philosophical Thought
These systems of thought infect even the perspective of those seen by soci-
ety, and ultimately themselves, as other. The result is a feeling of alienation 
imposed not only by the overt acts of oppression, but also by the mindset 
that the oppressive relationship assumes and asserts. Many modern philoso-
phies examine what it means to be placed in this position, along with the 
psychological effects and the change in perspective it engenders. Moreover, 
working from the existentialists’ first-person perspective, these philosophies 
reconstruct the perspective literally from those on the other side. These con-
structions aren’t valuable just for understanding a point of view that may be 
alien to some; they also set up the terms and conditions of the problem, 
describing the oppression from the inside out. Thinkers in this tradition 
assert that only with this kind of understanding can progress be made 
toward conquering oppression in all its most subtle and insidious forms.
Racism as inauthenticity
In his classic essay “Portrait of an Anti-Semite,” Jean-Paul Sartre argues that 
anti-Semitism (or any form of bigotry) is a form of inauthenticity, or a flight 
from freedom. The essay has proved to be of lasting importance for the anal-
ysis of oppression. According to Sartre, when someone embraces bigotry, 
fundamentally he’s really embracing his prejudices rather than rejecting the 
object of his hatred. The word prejudice is appropriate here, because what 
the bigot is doing is reaffirming his own notions (prejudgments) of how 
things are and should be. By casting Jewish people as evil and focusing on 
their unfitness for this or that parcel of respect, what’s good and what’s fit 
are assumed. Because what’s good is assumed, it’s never put into question; 
it doesn’t need to be chosen or created.
Bigotry, then, is inseparable from the absolute systems and meaning narra-
tives people create to console themselves and distract them from the fact 
that the world is fundamentally meaningless, and that rather than being a 
given, the meaning of the world is their responsibility. The bigot evades ques-
tioning these systems of thought and is consoled by wallowing in his hatred. 
Sartre points out that the characteristics of the object of bigotry are irrele-
vant. The stereotype many have of the Jews, he points out, is that they are 
smarter and, in that sense, more qualified for many of the jobs they’re 
accused of taking unjustly from “good Frenchmen.” These details don’t 
matter, though, because what the bigot is affirming isn’t a rational principle 
of comparative qualifications. He’s affirming an absolute system that puts 
everything in its proper place without regard to the concrete particulars of 
the situation.

308
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
With the aid of insights like Sartre’s, much of modern philosophy starts from 
an understanding of bigotry as a holistic phenomenon. In this phenomenon, 
individual occurrences have a direct connection to the systematic values of 
the entire culture, even if these values aren’t obviously racist. These ideas 
have influenced not only theoretical philosophy, but also civil-rights legisla-
tion. Legislation such as affirmative action, hate-crimes legislation, and work-
place discrimination laws don’t aim simply at eradicating specific impediments 
to equality, but also attempt to effect a systematic change in the way people 
see things. The goal is to sever the link and, hence, reinforcement between 
institutional systems of thought and individual acts and feelings of bigotry.
This is also why much of modern civil-rights rhetoric is aimed at getting 
people to question their assumptions and engage in soul-searching reflection 
of the nature of bigotry. It isn’t simply in hopes that the bigots will realize the 
error of their ways by learning through these reflections that blacks, women, 
and so on are human beings too. If Sartre is right, the point of this soul 
searching is that it’s antithetical to bigotry. If bigotry is a way of avoiding the 
need to questions your assumptions, if it’s a way to run from free choice, by 
confronting people with their free choice and making them confront their 
most basic beliefs, you give them occasion not just to reject racism, but also 
to embrace a freely chosen belief system. They are, of course, always free to 
choose bigotry, but if Sartre is right, much of the impetus for doing so has 
been undermined.

Doing Psychology 
the Existential Way
In This Chapter
 Surveying existential ideas that affected psychology
 Investigating some key existential-humanist psychologists
I
f you’ve been reading this book from the start, the existential program 
should be clear by now. Humans are unique. They’re individual. They’re 
free, and they’re responsible for their situations. They crave meaning and a 
sense of purpose. They fear death and suffer from anxiety.
Because these descriptions are about the nature of the human being, you 
may expect a possible impact on the field of psychology. After all, psycholo-
gists are scientists who strive to understand the motivations and behaviors 
of the human being. In fact, you may expect an influence on the way some 
psychologists understand living a healthy psychological life or even on 
understanding how people develop any number of unhealthy dysfunctions.
In this chapter we look at the influence existentialism has on psychology. 
Existentialism altered the way some psychologists understood the human 
being as an entity and how they thought others should understand and ana-
lyze the behavior of the human being.
First, we analyze a list of basic similarities between existentialism and what 
later became known as the humanistic or existential-humanist movement in 
psychology. From there, we survey three specific psychologists whose theo-
ries of human psychology embody in different ways key existential themes.

310
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Points of Contact: Existentialism 
Meets Psychology
Existentialist thinking had an influence on the way some psychologists under-
stood and saw the human being. Previously, psychology viewed the human 
being as an object that could be studied in the same way that science tends 
to study all its objects. Before the existentialist influence, most psychologists 
saw the study of the human as no different from the way the biologist studied 
the cow or the way the physicist studied the motion of inanimate objects. 
Psychologists believed they could explain human behavior in terms of natu-
ral laws.
This way of thinking about humans dominated what was known as the first 
wave (Freudianism and followers of Sigmund Freud) and the second wave 
(behaviorism, following B. F. Skinner and John B. Watson). In the first wave, 
psychologists always explain human behavior in terms of unconscious drives 
and instincts and the laws that govern them. In the second wave, psycholo-
gists always explain behavior by the laws governing conditioning and stimu-
lus, the same way scientists study the behavior of mice in labs.
Existential-humanism, also known as the third wave, reacted strongly to these 
approaches. The existential-humanists saw humans as irreducibly unique and 
individual and, therefore, not fully understandable in terms of general laws. 
They saw the human as creative, possessing free will, striving for goals and 
the fulfillment of potential, and strongly craving meaning and significance.
Stressing the importance 
of human uniqueness
Existential-humanist psychologists often found themselves in conflict with 
natural science. If psychology was a natural science, they had to see the 
behavior of individual human beings as entirely explainable in terms of larger 
natural laws, the same way the behavior of other entities is explained by the 
laws of physics, biology, or chemistry. The existential-humanists rejected 
this approach, believing that individuals were too unique to be captured by 
general laws of any type.
 
Think of a ball falling to the ground. You can analyze this event by thinking 
about the properties of the ball at a given time — its weight, velocity, and so 
on. Each of these falls under general laws. Dense objects behave in such-and-
such ways, as do objects with velocity. After you think of the individual this 
way, you eventually understand its behavior completely in terms of those 

311
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
laws. Nothing about the ball as a unique particular thing seems to matter. The 
existential-humanists rejected this approach to understanding human behav-
ior. They said that you can’t understand the behavior of Sally without under-
standing Sally as a unique individual.
 
Abraham Maslow knew this approach would clash with the methodology of 
science. In response, he suggested that “if the study of the uniqueness of the 
individual does not fit into what we know of science, then so much the worse 
for the conception of science. It, too, will have to endure re-creation.” Instead 
of the existential-humanists changing their view of the human to fit science, 
he argued, science needed to change its method to fit what human beings 
actually are.
Putting the patient’s world 
front and center
Existentialism places high importance on the phenomenological method. 
Yup — big jargon word (we talk about it more in Chapter 6). The phenom-
enologist thinks that to understand what’s truly important about human 
beings, you have to pay close attention to how they actually experience 
things “from the inside.” In other words, the world of the first-person point of 
view matters.
The existential-humanists agree that to understand a particular person or 
human beings in general, you have to get into the head and see how things 
look from the inside out. Only by seeing how a person experiences the world, 
or how that person responds to what she considers meaningful within her 
world, can you ever truly understand that person’s behavior.
Today, this theory may seem obvious. If you want to know why a person is 
having problems in her marriage, it’s important to find out not only the expe-
riences she lives through, but also how those experiences are meaningful to 
her and, as a result, how she feels about them. After you get in the person’s 
world, you can start to understand what motivates her.
Of course, you’re probably used to living in a “How does that make you 
feel?” culture. So you expect psychologists to talk that way. But this talk-
about-your-feelings approach wasn’t always important. Earlier psychology 
saw human behavior as either driven by instincts and unconscious drives 
(Freudianism) or by learned reactions to stimuli in your environment 
(behaviorism). Neither approach took the conscious world seen from the 
inside very seriously at all.

Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Focusing on freedom and anxiety
Existential-humanists agree with existentialists that humans are free beings. 
As a result, understanding their behavior and living in a mentally healthy way 
means emphasizing the role of personal choice in life.
 
For the existential-humanists, freedom is obvious. Living a healthy life 
requires that a person embrace, psychologically, her own role as the person 
in direct control of her own life. Of course, most people can point to times 
when they’ve felt out of control or powerless. When that happens, you typi-
cally get depressed, or you enter some state of denial about what’s going on. 
It’s hard to deny that feeling effective in your own life leads to feeling psycho-
logically whole.
 
Of course, living up to your freedom isn’t easy. The existential-humanists 
agree that freedom leads to anxiety. Being free to choose your path in life 
means a great deal of unsettledness. But like the existentialists, they see 
unsettledness as perfectly natural. The perennial lack of certainty about which 
way to go is just what it means to be human; it’s the human situation.
Your response to anxiety, they suggest, is courage. You must have, as Paul 
Tillich once put it, the “courage to be.” That means emphasizing the impor-
tance of choice in the here and now. Avoiding choices by living in the past or 
by daydreaming about the future is of no use. To be psychologically healthy, 
you need to know not only what’s fixed in your life, but also what’s possible. 
From there, you can decide which alternative best suits who you are.
Programming the “perfect” world
Not all psychologists think human behavior is 
free. John B. Watson, an early behaviorist, felt 
very strongly that the behavior of human beings 
could be entirely explained in terms of the ways 
individuals are trained by their environments to 
respond to external stimuli. In a famous quote, 
Watson stresses the extremely “plastic” nature 
of human behavior, saying, “Give me a dozen 
healthy infants, well-formed, and my own speci-
fied world to bring them up in and I’ll guaran-
tee to take any one at random and train him to 
become any type of specialist I might select — 
doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, 
even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his 
talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, voca-
tions, and race of his ancestors.”
Essentially, Watson’s position is that the individ-
uals in question have no free will of their own to 
determine their futures; they do what their train-
ing (or Watson’s training, in this quote!) makes 
them do. Pretty bleak as a description of what 
people are! One of Watson’s behaviorist col-
leagues, B. F. Skinner, felt similarly and wrote a 
book called Walden Two, in which he described 
a possible utopia that could be formed by train-
ing people through conditioning to perform cer-
tain tasks — tasks that they’d be trained to love 
and be happy with. Of course, you may wonder 
about the human element. What about reflect-
ing on the possible options for your own future 
and making individual decisions? Behaviorism 
seems to discount all that.

313
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
Seeing the people as goal directed
The fact that existentialists and existential-humanists see the human being 
as free leads to another central issue: that the human being is essentially 
goal directed. You’re always reaching out for some project or aim that you 
can accomplish. Moreover, the existential-humanists think that you’re driven 
toward higher levels of functioning. You strive to reach your potential.
 
Unlike the behaviorists who came before them, the existential-humanists 
thought that humans, unlike dogs and other animals, had aspirations and 
dreams. Dogs don’t pace around the house thinking, “So what kind of dog do 
I want to be, anyway?” On the other hand, it’s pretty obvious that humans do 
have dreams and aspirations. As Heidegger put it, you’re always living one 
step ahead of yourself in the future, thinking of what to do and who to be next. 
The existential-humanists agree, but they stress that you’re always striving 
forward to make the most of your potential.
Given this positive dimension to human existence, the existential-humanists 
departed from traditional psychology, which had stressed mostly the 
existence of defects in the human being. Instead, the existential-humanists 
stressed that these positive capacities, and the psychological components 
that make them possible, should be studied and brought to center stage.
Finding meaning is central 
to your existence
According to the existentialists, you need to find meaning in things. You 
just can’t help it. And when you can’t find meaning, your life gets disrupted. 
People need meaning like they need air. Both the existentialists and the 
existential-humanists stress this central component of human existence.
People today have an especially hard time fitting life into a larger significant 
plan or purpose. (See Chapter 3 for more about existential crises in modern 
times.) You may have a hard time plugging into the world in a way that your 
ancestors were able to do more easily. As a result, patients in therapists’ 
offices are talking more and more despairingly about their own failure to find 
a real sense of purpose in life. Are you surprised that the self-help section in 
the bookstore has so many bestsellers?
The existential-humanists felt strongly that to live in a mentally healthy way, 
a person (or a patient) needed to be guided back toward the difficult task 
of finding meaning in life.

314
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
The Existential Psychologists
The preceding section provides a general discussion of the similarities and 
shared concerns that bind the existentialists and the existential-humanists. 
Now we talk about some of the specific existential-humanist psychologists 
and what they said. What did they prescribe? How did they incorporate some 
of the insights we look at earlier in the chapter?
First up is Rollo May. May’s theories stress the importance of understand-
ing human existence as being-in-the-world, and healthy living means being 
integrated in-the-world in the specific ways that are natural for you. Second 
is theorist Carl Rogers, whose understanding of the self shows clear connec-
tions to existential themes of individuality and authenticity. Last is Viktor 
Frankl. According to Frankl, what defines you as human is your need for 
meaning and your need to take control over the direction of your life by 
giving it purpose.
Rollo May: Reconnecting with existence
Rollo May (1909–1994) was an American psychologist and perhaps the 
first to explicitly identify his own leanings as existential in orientation. 
May’s thinking has many aspects, so in the upcoming sections, we present 
one theme: his view that human existence is a way of being connected to 
the world. May felt that actualizing all these ways of being connected to the 
world was essential to mentally healthy living.
Positive psychology: Stressing the good
As far as Abraham Maslow saw it, Freudianism 
presented the “sick half” of the human being 
(with its focus on neurosis). Now it was 
time for psychology to present the “healthy 
half.” Although this way of thinking about the 
human being is typical to existential-humanism, 
it became formalized in the 1990s as a move-
ment known as positive psychology. Martin 
Seligman — a recent pioneer in the field and 
author of books with titles such as Authentic 
Happiness — and other positive psychologists 
believe that psychology needs to turn its atten-
tion to the kinds of psychological phenomena 
that contribute to human well-being. Some 
examples may be the psychological studies 
of happiness, courage, hope, trust, and deter-
mination. In addition, positive emotions are 
emphasized. Sounds cool, doesn’t it? As far as 
Maslow and Seligman see it, psychology isn’t 
just about what goes wrong with humans, but 
also about what goes right with them!

315
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
May’s notion of human existence: Everyone lives in three worlds
Martin Heidegger argued that human existence exemplified what he called 
being-in-the-world (see Chapter 6 for details). This phrase means that you 
aren’t a separate thing from the world, so you don’t exist in it the way that 
a pen can be in a room. Instead, Heidegger felt that worldliness was a part 
of the actual way that people exist. Due to this fact, when you live in a way 
that fails to embrace what you are, thus rejecting the ways in which you’re 
worldly, you’re inauthentic. When you succeed in embracing your nature, 
you’re living authentically.
Adapting those points to psychology is straightforward. Living authentically 
means living in a psychologically healthy way, whereas inauthentic living is 
unhealthy. With these points in mind, May suggests that everyone lives in 
three worlds (or Welt, which is German for world). They are
 
 Umwelt (environment-world): You have natural urges and drives; you 
possess a body and an unconscious. You’re subject to the natural world 
around you and the laws that govern it.
 
 Mitwelt (with-world): You exist in a meaningful social world. In addition, 
in the Mitwelt you forge meaningful relationships with others as persons.
 
 Eigenwelt (own-world): You have a self-reflective relationship with your-
self. You’re conscious of how things affect you and how you feel. You’re 
in touch with yourself.
Keeping your worlds in balance
According to May, being psychologically healthy means living in all three 
worlds at once. You have to keep all in the correct balance. But what does it 
mean for the worlds to get out of balance?
First, look at the Umwelt, or the world in which you’re a natural being. 
(Kierkegaard would have called the Umwelt your finitude; see Chapter 10.) 
To embrace the Umwelt, you must embrace your natural being. In part, that 
means accepting your own inevitable death. We don’t know about you, but 
most people we know don’t do this very well. As a matter of fact, the way 
society handles death allows most people to easily avoid the subject until it 
can’t be put off any longer. Although death is always all around you, binding 
you, you don’t talk much about it. In today’s society, it’s taboo.
 
Your need for Mitwelt existence relates to your need to connect with others 
as persons. You need to have healthy relationships in which both parties 
recognize, respect, honor, and trust the other. People often fail to do this. One 
of the most obvious ways people fail to recognize and honor others is through 
sex, which is one of the most intimate ways people can have meaningful rela-
tionships with others. Many times, people fail to engage in sex as a way of 
exemplifying the meaningful dimension of a human relationship and instead 
treat it as a way to manipulate another person as an object (a nonperson).

316
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
May says, “Individuals need to find each other for the sheer necessity of 
meeting biological needs . . . [but in this case] we are not really dealing with 
Mitwelt at all but only another form of Umwelt.” When you treat the other 
person as an object during sex, you rob your existence of the Mitwelt and 
overemphasize the Umwelt.
The Eigenwelt is the world of the self-relationship. Clearly, everyone needs 
to have a healthy relationship with herself; you need to treat yourself as 
a person. You need to learn to respect yourself, listen to yourself, and be 
responsive to your own ways of reacting to things or thinking about your 
life situations. Unfortunately, people often don’t do this particularly well. At 
times, you may drag the world of the Eigenwelt in the world of the Mitwelt or 
the Umwelt.
When you drag the Eigenwelt into the world of the Mitwelt, you seek to 
become a robotic conformist. When you drag Eigenwelt into Umwelt, you 
think of yourself as nothing more than a set of biological drives and urges 
and instincts. In both senses, you obscure the Eigenwelt by objectifying 
yourself and refusing to acknowledge your own unique personhood.
Helping people reconnect
The three worlds typically fall out of balance due to unhealthy ways of react-
ing to anxiety. May thinks that people feel anxiety when they detect threats 
to their existence or to their way of being. As May sees it, these threats are 
normal. It’s life; you grow and you develop. Your relationships mature, and 
your ways of relating to yourself and to your own drives undergo change. 
So you have to learn to deal with normal anxiety and face the situations in 
ways that allow your ways of existing to develop. When people refuse to do 
this, they become neurotic; they create defense mechanisms that attempt to 
obscure the situations they’re threatened by, and as a result, their worlds get 
out of balance.
With this in mind, May believed that the function of therapy was to help 
people who had become alienated from themselves (by being out of sync 
in any of those three worlds) to learn to confront their true nature with 
courage. Ideally, therapy would allow people to reconnect with their being-
in-the-world in the right way so that they could eventually live in a way that 
embraced everything they were.
Carl Rogers: Fully functional individuals
Carl Rogers (1902–1987) was an American psychologist famous for client-
centered (or person-centered) therapy. He felt that people were essentially 
good and that you could find the basic motivational structure of human psy-
chology in the fundamental desire to strive for the development of the unique 
potential of the individual. Rogers’s claim echoes the existentialists’ empha-
sis on the cultivation of authentic individuality.

317
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
 
For Rogers, a basic fact about nature was that all organisms (not just humans) 
seek to actualize themselves, which means that they all strive for the fulfill-
ment of their potential. Humans are always reaching out for the possibilities 
that can help them develop and cultivate the unique individuality that each 
possesses.
So how do you develop your potential? For Rogers, each person can tell 
what’s right for her development in a given situation. So you have the ability 
to know best how to navigate the changing world of your experiences. What 
this means, for Rogers, is that you must learn to listen to the inner voice that 
represents the true individual you (Rogers calls this the organismic self).
The characteristics of fully functioning people
Rogers called people who listened to their organismic self and successfully 
developed their potential fully functioning people. These people have a unique 
relationship with the world around them; they have a childlike wonder and 
an openness to experience. If you’re fully functioning, you’re
 
 Open: When life changes unexpectedly, you’re open to what’s new. You 
desire to have a kind of dialogue with life. You seek to learn from the 
diversity and novelty of experience, as opposed to making demands on 
it. You welcome change.
 
 Engaged in the here and now: You’re not trapped in the past. You 
don’t force preconceived notions onto your present experience. You 
appreciate each moment as special and meaningful on its own terms.
 
 Self-trusting: You trust your own inner intuitions and voice. You listen 
to what they tell you about experience. You don’t suppress your own 
inner feelings or seek out others to find out how best to understand 
your experiences.
 
 Creative: You accept that no external rules dictate how you should 
mechanically respond to or interpret experience. Instead, you creatively 
engage with life, seeking to adapt in an artistically appropriate way what 
you found in older experience to the new world in which you presently 
live. Living is an art form that only you can master by utilizing your own 
inner resources and intuitions.
That sounds pretty darn cool, huh? Who wouldn’t want to be fully function-
ing? Unfortunately, some people aren’t fully functioning. For Rogers, the 
capacity to be fully functioning needs to be developed in the right context 
and conditions. Some people lack those contexts. Specifically, Rogers feels 
that you need to be at the center of loving relationships that foster self-
esteem and the ability to trust yourself and listen to your inner voice.

318
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
You may ask, “If everyone is running around just listening to their own 
inner voice, how will society function? Won’t things just reduce to chaos?” 
Fortunately, no. Rogers doesn’t think that being an individual puts you at 
odds with society or with the various societal roles that you might play. 
Instead, Rogers wants us to see that we aren’t defined by those roles in such 
a way that the degree to which we conform to what others want us to do and 
to be determines our own self-worth. A psychologically healthy person may 
well live comfortably in society but would always have a very strong sense of 
self-worth not dependent upon the values of the society around her. In fact, 
Rogers feels that fully functioning people likely wouldn’t stand out at all!
It’s also important to note that Rogers feels that fully functioning people 
are driven by a desire to help others reach their own potential. So whereas 
believing that following your inner voice might lead to a lot of self-centered 
and perhaps socially destructive behavior, it actually leads to caring benevo-
lent dispositions toward others!
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
Carl Rogers claimed that reaching your full 
potential requires first satisfying other, more 
basic needs (such as being in loving, esteem-
building relationships). You can see this claim 
in other existential-humanist psychologists, 
specifically in Abraham Maslow, who is typi-
cally regarded as one of the founders of the 
existential-humanist approach. From the bottom 
up, here’s Maslow’s hierarchy of needs:
  At the most basic, Maslow suggests, are 
physical needs. Here, you strive for physi-
cal survival and have needs for air, drink, 
food, and even sex.
  After you satisfy these needs, you strive for 
safety and protection.
  Once again, when these two needs are 
satisfied, you turn toward a need for love 
and belonging among others. At this higher 
level of human existence, you need respect, 
admiration, and friendship.
  After you satisfy relational needs, you 
develop a desire for self-esteem. You crave 
a kind of self-confidence about your own 
abilities and ways of engaging with the 
world on your own terms.
  The last level is the most famous and 
clearly the most existential. Maslow felt 
that barely 1 percent of the population 
typically reaches it. He called it self-
actualization. At this level, you begin to 
partake in an almost spiritual dimension 
of existence through the fulfilling of your 
own potential (this is Maslow’s version of 
Rogers’s fully functioning person). Some 
who reach this level, he felt, may have what 
he called peak experiences in which the 
person experiences a mystical and spiritual 
connection to reality. These people develop 
a real sense of peace with themselves and 
with their world. Unfortunately, Maslow 
thought, most people can’t reach this level 
because they find themselves (for various 
reasons) trapped at lower levels within 
the hierarchy, seeking to satisfy more 
basic needs.

319
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
The authentic individual self versus conditional positive regard
Rogers says that the abilities of fully functioning people grow and develop 
in relationships in which unconditional regard is given. Most people tend 
to get acceptance from other people but only in conditional form. This type 
of acceptance is actually damaging to the development of fully functioning 
individuals.
Socialization, on the other hand, is more common. By its very nature, it tends 
not to give unconditional positive regard. Instead, it gives conditional posi-
tive regard, programming you to think that you’re okay or valuable if you do 
this or that or if you act in certain ways. It tells you to trust your inner voice 
only if it says the right things (in other words, what society likes).
When you’re exposed to socialization or relationships that foster conditional 
positive regard, you develop what Rogers calls conditional positive self-regard. 
When this happens, you discount your own inner voice when it conflicts with 
what you’re taught matters or is of value to those around you.
Instead of responding to changing experiences on the basis of trusting your 
individual unique voice, you match your feelings and behavior to what you 
think you’re supposed to do or to what the existentialists might call your inau-
thentic self (the self that mirrors society, or what Heidegger called “the They” 
or Kierkegaard called “the Public”).
 
Rogers’s method of therapy aimed at getting people to feel more comfortable 
with their authentic individual self by being a good empathetic listener and by 
giving the client unconditional positive regard. As Rogers puts it, the therapist 
should aim to get the client to develop a “friendly openness to what is going 
on within him — learning to listen sensitively to himself.” Thus, the goal of 
therapy is to help the client overcome oppressive socialization or dysfunc-
tional relationships that stand in the way of full functioning. At its core, it aims 
at helping to allow a person become an authentic individual.
Viktor Frankl: Embracing 
the need for meaning
Viktor Frankl (1905–1997) was an Austrian psychiatrist who developed a 
method of treating patients called logotherapy. At its core is a strong existen-
tial theme: that all people have within them a strong innate drive for finding 
meaning. Many neuroses, Frankl felt, could be traced back to disruptions 
in that need, to “holes” within a person’s life in which nothing held any real 
significance. As a result, he says that psychotherapy needs to address the 
patient’s need for meaning in life, seeking to fill in the holes that exist.

320
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
Apart from his theories, Viktor Frankl is himself a man worth studying. In his 
book Man’s Search for Meaning, he describes not only his proposed psycho-
logical method of logotherapy (meaning therapy), but also the experience 
that led him to posit the theory: his experiences in a Nazi concentration 
camp during World War II. Frankl’s description of his experiences and what 
he learned about human psychology is a must-read. Frankl says that his 
experiences in the camps led him to develop three theses about the human 
condition:
 
 Meaning always exists: Meaning can be found in every situation. 
Meaning is a feature of your life situations. If you’re open to it, you’ll 
come see it; if you close yourself off from it, you won’t.
 
 Uniqueness: Frankl felt that every person was unique, and so needed to 
find the meaning in the situation that was appropriate to the uniqueness 
of her experiences and life. As a result, you can’t turn to society or to 
the masses to explain the significance of a situation. You have to find the 
meaning yourself.
 
 Finding meaning is up to you: You’re free, which implies that in every 
situation, finding the meaning within it is up to you. It’s always there; 
Frankl says that you need to go find it!
 
Although Frankl believes that meaning is always present — even in the Nazi 
camps — it’s not always easy to find. In fact, Frankl suggests that some fail to 
find meaning and experience what he called an existential vacuum. When this 
happens, life simply fails to have any significance at all, and the person loses 
her sense of purpose. She despairs and loses hope and her will to live. As far 
as Frankl could determine, in the death camps many people lost hope and 
their will to live not simply as a result of the externalities they had to endure, 
but because of their inability to discern meaning in those situations.
You too can succumb to the existential vacuum and the neuroses that follow 
from it. If you fail to find meaning, you typically become self-destructive and 
fall into depression or even into addictive behaviors (think of Kierkegaard’s 
rotation; see Chapter 10 for more on this). People within the existential 
vacuum live what Frankl calls provisional existence. Without real-life goals 
anchored in a secure sense of purpose and meaning, you fail to live in a 
true sense.
The methods of logotherapy
Recognizing that life situations can dislodge a person from living with a 
sense of purpose, logotherapy aims to get the client to frame her life in terms 
of meanings. As with most existential-humanist psychology, it’s crucial that 
the patient not see herself as a passive victim. The patient learns to take 
control. Although logotherapy is complicated, two of its methods are worth 
pointing out:

321
 Chapter 14: Doing Psychology the Existential Way
 
 Paradoxical intention: This method aims to cure phobias or neurotic 
anxiety. One of Frankl’s actual cases may help explain. Imagine that you 
have a fear of sweating in social situations. Instead of waiting passively 
(like a victim) for the inevitable to occur, Frankl suggests taking the 
wind out of the anxiety by commanding yourself to sweat — more than 
you typically do! Say, “I’m going to sweat a good gallon today! That’ll 
show ’em.”
 
 Paradoxical intention (paradoxical because you decide to actively do 
what you fear most) is interesting because it teaches the person to take 
control by assigning a significance to the situation. Frankl also suggests 
that paradoxical intention adds humor to your relationship to your 
own life.
 
 De-reflection: This second method goes right to the heart of logo-
therapy. Imagine any situation in which you find yourself anxious about 
some kind of performance. Maybe you have to take a big exam, and you 
always get test anxiety, or maybe the situation is sexual in nature. In 
both situations you’re anxious to participate in some activity because 
you fear being exposed as a failure.
 
 If you’ve ever experienced this, you know that the worst thing is think-
ing more about the object of the anxiety. The more you think about 
it, the more likely you are to fail. In fact, there’s a name for this: the 
self-fulfilling prophecy. Frankl sees the problem this way: Your hyper-
reflection (intense concentration on what’s causing you performance 
anxiety) has dislodged you from your normal, seamless way of existing 
in your life.
 
 How does de-reflection help? Well, it aims to help you reintegrate into 
flow. It helps you ignore the anxiety and instead concentrate on some-
thing completely different, something that would make the activity 
meaningful in a way unrelated to the concerns of your anxiety. Again, 
and like paradoxical intention, the aim is to take control and to teach 
the person to give her activities meaning.
Finding meaning
The aim of logotherapy is to help a person find meaning in life. According to 
Frankl, you can find meaning in at least three central ways:
 
 Task oriented: This way of finding meaning is very common for people. 
Think of what people often say to someone who doesn’t have a direction 
in her life, someone who seems to just drift aimlessly without purpose. 
People tell her, “You need to find something that’s important to you” or 
“You need to find your calling.”
 
 Often, what they mean is that the person needs to find some kind of 
activity that she can throw herself into. Perhaps that activity is being 
a good parent. Or being a good teacher. In typical existential fashion, 
Frankl doesn’t insist on this or that activity; what’s important is that the 
patient connect to the world in a way that allows her to feel as though 
things matter.

322
Part IV: The Enduring Impact of Existentialism 
 
 Experience oriented: Frankl also points out that humans often experi-
ence meaning passively. You’re at a museum and see a painting that 
strikes you. Or perhaps you see meaning in the way that a bee flies 
around honey. Suddenly, you feel as though you’re connected with life 
in a way that can be very overwhelming. Sometimes such experiences 
can actually be life-altering!
 
 Attitude oriented: The last way in which people typically find meaning, 
Frankl suggests, is in moments of intense suffering — moments in which 
you feel as though your existence may actually be seriously threatened. 
Sometimes something physical causes these experiences; some people 
are faced with terminal illness. At other times, something psychologi-
cal causes these experiences; some people are faced with the death of 
a loved one. In either case, you’re presented with a horrifying question: 
“What’s the point of life now?”
 
 Frankl thinks that at these moments, you have to find meaning once 
again, in those situations. Frankl says that choosing what your experi-
ences are isn’t always up to you (having a terminal illness; losing a loved 
one; or even, in his situation, winding up in a concentration camp). But 
you do have the capacity to decide what your attitude will be toward 
that situation.
 
 In an actual case study, Frankl talks about a patient who lost his wife. 
The man was overwhelmed with grief and couldn’t find a reason to live 
on. Frankl asked the patient what it would have been like if he had died 
first. The man suggested that it would have been worse, because his wife 
wouldn’t have been able to bear it, because she was less able to endure 
being alone than he.
 
 Frankl then wondered whether his grief was his way of acknowledging 
that he was giving his wife the last gift to her that he could — bearing 
the role of being the survivor for the other. According to Frankl, the 
man’s life was changed immediately because he found a meaning to give 
to his suffering.

 Perusing a list of movies to see
A
rt is a very immediate experience. Through pictures, stories, and 
words, it brings you in direct confrontation with its subject matter. 
Movies blend all three, making it a particularly visceral medium. Much like 
painting and sculpture, movies often seem to have a direct line to our emo-
tions. Perhaps this is what makes them such a good way of conveying exis-
tential themes. Unlike most other philosophies, existentialism calls you to 
think and feel, and it reminds you that you always make your decisions and 
take actions within concrete situations. Movies can present your existential 
situation in concrete terms and make you feel it. And as anyone who’s ever 
seen the right movie at just the right time in his life knows, movies don’t 
simply make you feel, but also help you process and work through emotions 
you already possess.
The movies have a rich history of presenting existential material. American 
film noir of the 1930s and 1940s, although not directly affected by the existen-
tial furor happening in Europe at the same time, seemed to be coming to 
many of the same conclusions. Their characters were often thrown into a 
world where the old rules of morality seemed to have been suspended. 
Themes of loneliness and forlornness cloaked morally ambiguous characters 
as they tried to navigate their way through a barren landscape where moral 
compasses seemed to have gone haywire.
Although not always as dark, movies have continued to present characters 
dealing with existential issues to this day. But where to start choosing the ten 
best of these movies? We haven’t even tried. Too many films are too good 
and too existential. Instead, we tried to pick ten great films with a variety of 
styles and takes on existential issues. We include movies that we think you 
should see or, if you’ve seen them before, movies we think you should see 
again while reflecting on the existential nature of the stories they present.

Despite its reputation as a downer philosophy, existentialism has an optimis-
tic, even hopeful side. Indeed, this is at the core of the philosophy in many 
respects. As a whole, the mix of movies in this chapter not only presents a 
world gone mad and unhitched from meaning, but also brings you back and 
shows you the light these thinkers saw at the end of the tunnel.
Ikiru (1952)
If you enjoy great foreign films, Ikiru is a must-see that you should pencil into 
your list of what to rent. Like The Seventh Seal (see the next section), the film 
is enjoyable not only from a purely philosophical angle, but also from the 
standpoint of pure aesthetics. This fact shouldn’t be surprising, because Ikiru 
is, for sure, a masterpiece created by one of the greatest Japanese directors 
of all time: Akira Kurosawa.
Ikiru begins its story with a man in his late 50s, Mr. Watanabe, at the doctor’s 
office. He’s had some stomach pains and has X-rays performed to discover 
what the medical problem actually is. Unfortunately, it’s cancer; Watanabe 
has just a few months to live.
This abrupt face-to-face confrontation with his impending finitude or death 
has an immediate and monumental effect on Watanabe. For more than 20 
years he had worked as a low-level functionary within civil-service manage-
ment, with no outside life to speak of. Now he suddenly finds that his old 
tasks provide absolutely no meaning for him. The news of his cancer casts 
him into an entirely unfamiliar world and forces him to ask, “How do I live?” 
(Translated, the title of the movie means To Live.) Thus the movie unfolds, 
chronicling Watanabe’s different ways of responding to that question in light 
of his death.
The existential overtones should be pretty clear already! Although the film 
has many existential themes, the following three stand out as particularly 
important:
 
 Death individuates you. Although this is a common existential theme, 
it’s one that’s particularly pronounced in Heidegger (see Chapter 9). As 
Heidegger argues, when you come face to face with death, you strongly 
experience the mood of anxiety (see Chapter 4 for more about anxiety). 
Anxiety and death together have a powerful effect on you: They individu-
ate you. In other words, they force you to come to grips with the fact 
that the meaning of your existence isn’t exhausted by the social roles 
and routines that the crowd demands that you perform. As a result, 
facing death forces you to feel separate from the way you’re expected to 
live. In the face of death, your routines seem artificial.

327
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
 
 People strive hard to avoid death. Even though honestly facing up to 
death can be liberating, people tend not to think about death, and they 
don’t bring up the subject. Watanabe’s own doctors don’t tell him the 
truth; they lie about his illness. The film makes clear that before the 
diagnosis, Watanabe himself hadn’t been honest about his own mortal-
ity. He lived a dead life, one deeply immersed in what “one” was 
expected to do. His relationships were hollow. If death is faced at all, it’s 
wrapped up in social rituals meant to distract people from the actual 
confrontation with death they need to have. In fact, in Ikiru, Watanabe 
suffers partly because he finds it almost impossible to actually find 
people who will honestly acknowledge his situation.
 
 Death forces you to give your life individual meaning. Because an 
honest confrontation with mortality is so jarring, people often tend to 
try to run away from it, either back into the life of the crowd or into vari-
ous kinds of hedonistic distraction. But if you can’t distract yourself, 
you must face death, existentialists suggest, by creating a meaning for 
your life that is your own. One person who particularly suggested this 
was Viktor Frankl (see Chapter 14 for details), an existential psycholo-
gist who felt strongly that living in a healthy way required finding ways 
to meaningfully integrate yourself into the world as a unique person. As 
you watch the movie, ask yourself whether Watanabe ever does this — 
whether he finds true meaning to life.
The Seventh Seal (1957)
The Seventh Seal is a classic existential film that’s also a cinematic master-
piece. Directed by Ingmar Bergman, this subtitled Swedish film is enjoyable, 
and the pleasure of viewing it goes beyond its admittedly clear philosophical 
dimensions.
If you like grim movies, the setting of The Seventh Seal is perfect for you. 
The film is set at the end of the Crusades and chronicles the return home to 
Europe of one of the knights (Antonius Block) and his faithful squire. When 
Block and the squire arrive in their land at the beginning of the film, the 
knight is approached by Death himself, who has apparently come to take 
him. The knight protests and challenges Death to a game of chess. They 
reach an agreement: As long as the game proceeds, Block’s life is spared, and 
if he wins, Death leaves. Thus, the film begins with the portrait of a man 
who’s forced to face his own death — literally! — throughout the whole film, 
as Death returns every so often to continue the game and conversation.
As the knight and the squire make their way through the countryside on the 
way to Block’s castle, they encounter a Europe ravaged by the curse of the 
Black Plague. The countryside itself appears to have descended into total 

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
chaos, and they encounter many people who deal with the constant specter 
of death and suffering in very different ways (including an odd band of actors 
and musicians who are central to the plot and who seem oddly unaffected).
More than perhaps any other film, The Seventh Seal is consciously existen-
tialist straight through. Although the film deals with many, many themes, 
perhaps two questions are central:
 
 Does God exist? This, of course, is a defining question in existentialism, 
one that different authors deal with in different ways. One way to think 
about it is as a series of questions: Are there right ways to live or right 
answers to the questions about life? Or is part of life dealing with the dif-
ficulties, trials, and suffering of an ambiguous existence that comes with 
no assurance of clear answers?
 
 Is life meaningless if there is no God? If there are no God, no right or 
wrong, and no way to live that’s objectively true, what’s the overall 
point of life itself? If there is no God, would life collapse into meaning-
lessness as a result? Should you be forced to despair in such a bleak 
world? As Block puts it, without proof of God’s existence, the idea of 
God is nothing more than suffering — a suffering that people would be 
better to do without. The idea of God, as Block sees it, is a reminder to 
you that you live in fear and despair before the nothingness of the 
world. As he puts it, “Why can’t I kill God within me? Why does he 
live on in this painful and humiliating way even though I curse him and 
want to tear him out of my heart? I want knowledge, not faith. . . . I want 
God to stretch out his hand toward me, reveal himself to me.” When 
you study Kierkegaard (see Chapter 10), Block’s request may sound a 
bit odd!
These questions, and many other ones, are raised in The Seventh Seal. Enjoy!
Apocalypse Now (1979)
Like war movies? Well, this is certainly a great one by any standard, set 
during the Vietnam War in the 1970s. Like a few of the other films on this 
list, Apocalypse Now is worth viewing for more than just the philosophical 
lessons; it’s a cinematic classic brought to you by one of America’s most 
famous directors, Francis Ford Coppola.
In the film, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen) is an assassin for mili-
tary intelligence. He’s sent up a river in Vietnam and into Cambodia to find 
another officer, Colonel Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando). As Willard is told 
at the start of the film, Kurtz was an amazing soldier with a storied career, 
one whom most people expected to end up in a high position in government.

329
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
But now Kurtz has gone mad and has set himself up as a god in the jungles of 
Cambodia, acting with a small army of his own and taking orders from no 
one. Because Kurtz has gone insane, Willard is instructed to ride on a small 
Navy boat up the river to find him and eventually terminate his command. 
The movie follows the boat’s journey up the river and the experiences of the 
soldiers on board along the way. Eventually, toward the end, they get to their 
destination, and if you’re not already exhausted in the film, that’s when the 
fun really begins, in the heart of the jungle itself.
Of all the films on our list, Apocalypse Now is perhaps the one that’s least 
driven intentionally by a desire to represent existentialism. That said, the 
film clearly deals with lots of important existential questions. We highlight 
the central question here:
How far are you prepared to go to take on the challenge of self-creation?
When you read Nietzsche (see Chapter 11) and Kierkegaard (see Chapter 10), 
you’re presented with a picture of authenticity that demands that you follow 
who you are in creating yourself. You’re to follow your unique individuality 
to wherever the voice within you takes you. Many existentialists recognize 
that this journey may require a great deal of hardness, because you may not 
initially be prepared to go where that voice will take you. For Kierkegaard, 
following his path as an individual leads Abraham to obey God’s command to 
kill his son Isaac. Just how far are you willing to go to be an individual? Or are 
your attempts at self-creation always going to be safely enclosed within the 
boundaries of what you’re allowed to do by the masses and the crowd? If so, 
how self-created are you, really?
Existentialists try hard never to give the concept of authenticity a moral read-
ing. Authors such as Heidegger and Nietzsche and Kierkegaard all argue that 
what you are as an individual transcends moral codes. That doesn’t mean 
you can’t be moral, but it does mean that being an individual goes beyond it. 
As Nietzsche puts it, you must learn to live in the cold space beyond good 
and evil. This, of course, leads not to a kind of relativism, but actually toward 
a more demanding form of ethics.
In Apocalypse Now, you’re asked whether Colonel Kurtz (or Captain Willard, 
perhaps) is a potential specimen of authenticity. As Kurtz puts it in discuss-
ing his own life, he’s “beyond their lying, timid morality.” He knows what the 
crowd is (here represented by society and the military establishment), and 
he rejects it. He’s beyond it. He’s an individual. As you watch the film, pay 
close attention to how, as the soldiers progress up the river, all semblances 
of order and structure fall away. This is a clear existential reference to the 
fact that as you get closer and closer into the heart of what you are, you find 
chaos there — chaos that only you can organize on your own terms.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Blade Runner (1982)
Ridley Scott’s sci-fi noir story of a dystopian world in which humans hunt 
and kill their greatest creation has recently been rereleased with a brand-new 
ending, producing a new wave of enthusiasm for the science fiction classic. 
No matter which ending you prefer, the movie is replete with philosophical 
musings on a range of topics, including the nature of consciousness and iden-
tity, the dangers of capitalism and corporate-political collusion, and bio- and 
scientific ethics. But above all, it presents a radically existential view of the 
world and of the future.
Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a retired blade runner — someone 
whose job it is to hunt down and kill artificial people called replicants. The 
replicants are genetically based androids who are used as slave labor and 
prostitutes on off-world colonies but are illegal on earth and are destroyed 
immediately if discovered. Decker is brought out of retirement because he’s 
the best and because four particularly dangerous replicants have arrived in 
Los Angeles.
Replicants develop emotions, feelings, questions, and a desire to live. In a 
very real sense, then, Deckard is an assassin, and Harrison Ford plays him 
with the haunted, detached loneliness you may expect of one. But Deckard 
isn’t alone. The futuristic world he lives in is one of flattened emotions and 
alienation. People walk like ghosts through a nightmarishly foreboding urban 
landscape where it’s constantly dark and always raining (even though it’s 
L.A. — go figure). The most vibrant images are those of the ever-present 
advertisements and the video spokesmodel on display on giant Times 
Square-esque video monitors throughout the city. The high-tech ads say it 
all. This is a world governed by two things: technology and commerce. 
People have no place.
The human beings seem tired and resigned to this fact. The replicants, how-
ever, are almost youthful in their passion and curiosity. They’re designed to 
have only a four-year life span, so everything to them is new and strange, and 
their emotions are raw and intense. As Deckard hunts them, he slowly learns 
from them and begins to recapture his own humanity.
Blade Runner presents a bleak landscape devoid of color, meaning, and 
ethical touchstones. The God of Abraham has been replaced by the gods of 
science (in the guise of technology) and capitalism. The problem isn’t simply 
that these gods aren’t up to the task, but also that their whole orientation is 
confused. Both work in a mechanistic way to produce results, but the results 
aren’t calibrated to genuine human needs. The replicants represent and give 
voice to these human needs. They seek their creator for answers and find 
none (even though they, unlike the humans, are at least granted an audience 
with their creator).

331
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
But God isn’t the real enemy in Blade Runner. This is a world that lost faith in 
God long ago and has been lost in a nihilistic stupor ever since. Nietzsche 
warned that the era beginning with the death of God is a dangerous time. He 
and the rest of the existentialists warn against taking it too lightly and plung-
ing heedlessly forth in hedonistic glee, and they warn against trusting science 
and rationalism to save us. Science won’t save you. Technology won’t save 
you. Reason won’t save you. These things won’t save you because they can’t 
address your most basic human needs, for meaning, purpose, and a sense 
of self.
The emotions of the replicants, their yearning for purpose and for answers, 
aren’t solutions to these problems. Rather, they point to the direction in 
which something was left behind. When the nightmare world the replicants 
and the human blade runners both live in was created, something was forgot-
ten and not taken into account. It is, in many respects, the world that the 
existentialists predict will come if people allow their humanity to be taken 
out of the equation — if we allow the mechanizations of rationality, science, 
and technology to go unchecked, and undirected, by human ends and true 
human needs.
Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989)
Cliff: A strange man . . . defecated on my sister.
Wendy: Why?
Cliff: I don’t know. Is there . . . Is there any reason I could give you that 
would answer that satisfactorily?
Woody Allen’s existential masterpiece of choices and consequences (or the 
lack thereof) in a godless world is like an old-time morality play, without the 
morality. It’s an anguished cry against a universe without justice, a quiet 
expression of hope that somehow we can find a way to live in that universe, 
and the humble suggestion, brilliantly expressed, that the only way we can 
and do get through it is by loving one another.
The movie tells two distantly intertwined tales. In one, Woody Allen plays a 
riff on his usual neurotic intellectual. Cliff is a director who specializes in bio-
graphical documentaries that make no money and that no one is interested 
in. His wife persuades him to take a job working for her brother, Lester 
(played by Alan Alda), directing a biopic of his life. Lester is a TV producer 
and Cliff’s polar opposite — shallow; arrogant; self-confident; and, of course, 
highly successful. Soon, Cliff finds himself competing with his nemesis, 
Lester, for the beautiful Halley Reed (played by Mia Farrow), all the while 
making a documentary in which he compares his brother-in-law with 
Mussolini.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Meanwhile, Martin Landau plays Judah, a respected ophthalmologist who’s 
having mistress trouble. His mistress (played by Angelica Huston) insists 
that he leave his marriage. She calls his house, sends a letter to his wife, and 
even threatens to expose him as an embezzler. Judah goes to both his 
brother, who has Mafia connections, and a friend who’s a rabbi for help. 
Fittingly enough, the rabbi is going blind. Suffice it to say that the Mafia 
brother has no such handicap. By the end of the movie, you finally see Cliff 
and Judah together, and their two stories have painted a picture of a strange, 
indifferent universe and a few of the people struggling to understand as they 
wander through it.
Crimes and Misdemeanors deals with the choices you freely make, how those 
choices determine who and what you are, and what your life will be. It’s 
about making choices in a world in which the only consequences are human 
consequences and the only results are human results. In a world where God 
is absent, there’s no guarantee of the results, no guarantee the wicked will be 
punished or the just rewarded. More than anything, though, it’s a meditation 
on a fact that all the existentialists acknowledge and even stress: Life without 
God, without ultimate justice, is hard. The anguish and forlornness you feel 
when you face this fact is felt even by those who, being wicked or doing 
wicked things, benefit from the lack of any ultimate consequence.
But this is a comedy, and as Lester repeatedly reminds us, in a comedy 
things are funny as long as they bend but don’t break. Just when it seems 
everything is hopelessly broken, Cliff reminds us, as the existentialists do, 
that in a lonely universe, you can still find meaning in the people, projects, 
and activities with which you engage yourself; in this, there is hope.
Leaving Las Vegas (1995)
The value of life cannot be measured.
—Friedrich Nietzsche
If the optimism presented in the movie Pleasantville (see the later section 
about that movie) is a tough optimism, the optimism of Leaving Las Vegas is 
downright brutal. In many ways, the two movies resonate with each other, 
though each certainly stands on its own. Director Mike Figgis presents two 
characters, Ben (played by Nicolas Cage) and Sera (played by Elisabeth 
Shue), who seemingly (and to a large degree, really) have no hope, no pros-
pects, and no future. She’s a prostitute with an abusive pimp, and he’s an 
alcoholic intent on drinking himself to death. They fall in love, and nothing 
much changes besides the fact that they’re living these lives side by side.

333
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
Leaving Las Vegas is a challenging movie. It challenges moviegoers to look at 
two stock, cliché-ridden characters as people. It challenges the assumptions 
you have about those people; their lives; and the value of those bleak, often 
despairing, lives. The movie meets you halfway by presenting characters and 
events that are more complex, specific, and three-dimensionally human than 
a superficial description would lead you to expect. Having done that, it makes 
the events that unfold all the harder to watch. After you recognize its charac-
ters as people, the movie challenges you to watch without flinching as they 
bleed, often from self-inflicted wounds. The result is something beautiful and 
transformative. Few films can reacquaint you with your own humanity and 
the humanity of those around you, but Leaving Las Vegas manages to do both.
Watching Leaving Las Vegas is like an exercise in what Nietzsche calls the 
reevaluation of all values. We have for a very long time seen the world 
through the glasses of a certain, specific morality. We see and judge the 
world through this lens and a hundred others we routinely adopt from vari-
ous systems of thought. These systems of thought inform how we judge right 
and wrong, what is and is not of value, and the way we see how things are 
and the way things should be. For the existentialist, these notions must be 
reassessed at best and more likely abolished.
Nothing in Leaving Las Vegas is life as it should be, and nothing about it is 
the way you were told drunks, prostitutes, life, or love are. Certainly, this is 
Hollywood, and probably no story like this could ever really happen, but the 
concrete humanity of everything onscreen is so undeniable that it shatters 
the limited notions of what life is or should be. Seeing the beauty in the ugly 
landscapes traveled by this movie forces you to reassess, rediscover, and 
even re-create those most fundamental notions.
Pleasantville (1998)
David’s mom: When your father was here, I used to think, “This was it. 
This is the way it was always going to be. I had the right house. I had the 
right car. I had the right life.”
David: There is no right house. There is no right car.
Pleasantville is an existential fable, an eccentric fairy-tale journey that com-
bines comedy, drama, and fantasy with deep passion and belief in its underly-
ing themes. On one level, it’s a metaphor for and commentary on the radical 
and jarring changes that swept society in the 1960s. The commentary may 
be summed up in the words of Billy Joel, “The good ole days weren’t always 
good, and tomorrow ain’t as bad as it seems.” It shows a world in which 

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
things fall apart and some genuinely sad things occur. Who can see the lov-
able George Parker (portrayed by William H. Macy) lose his wife and not 
feel for him? In the end, however, it shows a world it believes you can be 
optimistic about — a world where, despite all your troubles, you’ll be okay.
The movie stars Tobey Maguire as David, a high school loser obsessed with 
the TV show Pleasantville, a Leave It to Beaver–style TV show from the 1950s 
in which everything is just so. Dad goes off to work at a job where he’s 
respected and valued, Mom keeps the house tidy and has dinner ready when 
he comes home, everybody knows everybody else, everybody knows what 
his role in the town is, and everything just makes sense. The town consists of 
Elm Street, Main Street, and Town Hall, and as the school’s geography 
teacher points out, that’s all you need to know.
One day, David and his sister Jennifer (played to perfection by Reese 
Witherspoon) find themselves magically transported into their TV set, into 
the world of Pleasantville. Their interactions with the townspeople slowly 
start to change everything. The once-idyllic little town, in which everything 
was once (literally) black and white, begins to change, and life begins to 
become more complicated and, at the same time, more interesting.
Pleasantville contains a host of scenes that give voice to existential themes. 
One of our favorites occurs when the townspeople gather to discuss what to 
do about all the disturbing changes happening in the town. Big Bob (the clos-
est thing to a villain in the movie) gets up in front of the crowd and advises, 
“The first thing we have to do is to separate out the things that are pleasant 
from the things that are unpleasant.”
This is what the old concept of the true world, which Nietzsche and the other 
existentialists rail against, tried to do (see Chapter 3). It’s one of the principal 
things that the existentialists say you must learn can’t be done. If there are 
no heaven and hell, all the good in universe and all the evil are both right 
here on earth together. If you’re to accept life, it must be an acceptance of 
the imperfect world that is, not an idyllic world you wish for or that you 
imagine exists elsewhere or existed once upon a time. By the end of the 
movie, the people of Pleasantville slowly learn to accept this.
More than anything, however, the movie is existential because its narrative 
about the journey of a small town mirrors the narrative the existentialists tell 
about the journey of the human species. When Nietzsche first proclaims the 
death of God, he does so with a mix of sorrow for what had been lost and 
excitement about what could now be. The excitement is about the possibili-
ties given life by the shattering of the old dogmatic ways of thinking and the 
potential for a new human flourishing out of the ashes of the beliefs that used 
to comfort us.

335
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
If you boil down the existential narrative, it goes something like this (many 
existentialists would reject the notion they have a narrative, but in one way 
or another, we all do): We used to believe in God, the church, human reason. 
We used to believe that there were answers to everything and that those 
answers could be provided from the outside. Life made sense, and we 
believed it had meaning. The stories presented by the church and other pur-
veyors of truth were comforting, but they were false and limited in scope — 
much like Pleasantville’s geography or the black-and-white thinking of its 
residents. When we lose these traditional ways of thinking, we experience 
anguish and forlornness, but these feelings only call us to engage in the world 
and take responsibility for what it will be. When you cast off the old systems 
of thought, everything doesn’t then become okay. You’re never fully rid of 
anguish. Rather, you’re able to face the fact that things were never really 
okay, and you start to create a new world and new values.
Pleasantville tells this story metaphorically and brings great questions of 
God, meaning, value, and the history of the human species down to a very 
intimate, concrete, and human level. This in itself is an existential approach 
to big issues. Most of all, it tells the story with the passionate but grounded 
optimism of the best existential writings. You won’t find the right house, but 
that’s okay, because there is no right house. You’ll make a worthwhile life in 
the house you choose.
Fight Club (1999)
Fight Club has a great cast, starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena 
Bonham Carter. The film begins in a place that most people probably find 
eerily familiar; it tells the story of a person who’s deeply lost or immersed 
within the life that society expects him to live. He works his job robotically, 
and it seems to hold no real meaning for him. When he gets home at night, he 
dedicates his time to decorating his house with new furniture in the hopes of 
getting it just right. Essentially, the film sets up the story of a man trying to 
do his best to be a vague abstraction, an everyman.
But then his apartment, which he sees as the embodiment of his very self, 
blows up while he’s away on business. Forced to find a new place to live, he 
boards with Tyler Durden, who’s portrayed as a bit of an oddball (to say the 
least). Very soon into the film, these two characters start a fight club, a base-
ment club dedicated to just that — a place where men can come together 
with the object of beating the tar out of one another for enjoyment. Along 
the way, the members of the fight club begin to take on missions designed to 
disrupt the smooth operation of the conformist world that exists outside 
their hidden underground club.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The fact that the film deals with existential themes is clearly intentional; it 
drips with existential metaphors and has a lot of dialogue meant to highlight 
themes you see in this book. Here are a few questions to get you thinking 
about this interesting movie:
 
 Does your existence demand struggle and confrontation? The film 
clearly presents you with a portrait of modern life as one in which 
struggle and confrontation have been, for the most part, either done 
away with or channeled toward society-approved projects. Most people 
live safely immersed within their very set routines. Desires to creatively 
express yourself, or even to struggle with existence, are redirected 
toward an addiction (or distraction) with consumerism (hence, the 
obsession the main character has with fixing up his apartment). As 
Durden puts it, “The things you own end up owning you.”
 
 If you listen to writers such as Nietzsche, however, this kind of 
life is missing an essential component that’s needed for health (or 
authenticity). That component is self-definition, and it requires that 
you continually fight new battles in trying to further challenge what 
you take yourself to be at any given moment. As Carl Rogers puts 
it (in Chapter 14), you must strive to develop your potential. For 
Nietzsche, the authentic person is like a warrior, one who’s constantly 
testing his mettle against perspectives that are contrary to his own 
and always striving to develop himself further. Due to this need, healthy 
living requires doing battle not just against society, but also against 
yourself — against your weak desires to flee the battle and rejoin the 
safety of the herd.
 
 Those people who interpret Fight Club as a movie about a strange club in 
which men beat one another up lose the main point. Instead, see the 
fight club as a metaphor for the need to engage with that primordial 
need for struggle. The fight club represents your need to be a warrior in 
life and to resist the goal of society to subdue you and make you tame.
 
 Do you create yourself? Does existence precede essence? Jean-Paul 
Sartre’s main point about self-creation lies at the heart of the film. While 
society or the herd will have you believe that you’re really just the roles 
that you play in the world, you can always change all that and define 
yourself in a way that suits who you are as an individual.
 
 Unfortunately, after too much time in society, people forget these things. 
They start working on the furniture in their apartment. In an interesting 
scene, Durden pulls a gun on a poor store owner and threatens to kill 
him, asking him what the man always wanted to be in life but gave up 
on. After the man tells him, Durden lets him go, telling Norton’s charac-
ter that the man will now see his life differently, having been freed to 
become himself through this deadly encounter. As Durden puts it, “It’s 
only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.”

Stranger Than Fiction (2006)
The moment I set eyes on him I instantly push him from me, I myself leap 
backwards, I clasp my hands and say half aloud, “Good Lord, is this the 
man? Is this really [personification of passion]? Why, he looks like a tax 
collector!”
—Søren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling
This movie is a strange delight. One part romantic comedy, one part absurd-
ist fantasy, it’s presented with the kind of care and passion rare in movies 
today. Its story resonates with existential concerns of passion, death, and 
meaning, but the movie never gets too deep and never allows itself to get 
pulled down under the weight of its underlying themes. Even at its most 
dramatic moments, it’s too busy being funny. Very, very funny.
Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick, an IRS tax auditor who starts hearing a 
woman’s voice inside his head. The voice follows him wherever he goes, 
narrating the events of his life. It isn’t a very exciting life. As the movie opens, 
you hear, as does Harold, a thorough description of his very detailed and 
precise method of brushing his teeth. Of course, this is very disturbing for 
Harold because he’s not used to hearing strange voices narrating his life. 
Things really take a turn, however, when the voice refers to Harold’s immi-
nent death. The rest of the movie finds Harold splitting his time between 
searching for the meaning and origin of this voice in a desperate attempt to 
save his own life, and pursuing Ana (played by Maggie Gyllenhaal).
We figure that if you’re in a race to save your own life, pursuing Maggie 
Gyllenhaal is about as worthwhile a distraction as you can find.
In real life, people tend to avoid those they see as serious, boring, uptight, 
and disconnected from the rest of the world. In literature and the movies, 
however, these people are often heroes. We love characters like Harold 
Crick, because although we like to think we’re more fun at parties, we feel 
just as alienated. Most people fear their own lives are as small, empty, and 
meaningless as the lives of characters like these, and they want to believe 
they can somehow come to live more full and rich lives, as the characters 
do by the end of their stories. It’s an existential concern given voice by 
hundreds of Harold Cricks in hundreds of stories about learning to love life. 
But this movie is richer. Some things to notice:
 
 Absurdity: Every scene in this movie has a touch of absurdity, including 
the movie’s premise; Harold’s relationship with Ana; the fact that he’s 
about to die; and most important, the decision he makes with regard to 
that fact. As Camus and Kierkegaard were especially adept at pointing 
out, that absurdity can be cruel and painful, but you must ultimately 
embrace it. This movie embraces that absurdity, and so does Harold, 
ultimately.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
 Death: The whole movie is about facing the reality, inevitability, and 
absurdity of death. As Professor Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman’s character) 
point’s out, “You will die. You will absolutely die. Even if you avoid this 
death, another will find you.” Only in facing this fact does Harold finally 
learn what it means to be alive.
 
 Narratives: Harold doesn’t merely face death; he faces an omniscient 
narrator (played by Emma Thompson) who defines not only the action, 
but also the meaning of his life. When you watch Harold brush his teeth, 
it’s interesting because the narrator describes it with so much wit and 
insight that it becomes meaningful. The way in which our lives have 
been defined by external, absolute systems (see Chapter 3) or narratives 
of meaning and how we must become the writers of our own narratives 
are central existential themes. Watch how Harold and, ironically enough, 
the narrator herself struggle with this narrative, what it means, and how 
it should be written.
 
 Passion: This is a movie about living with passion. For Kierkegaard, this 
was epitomized by the knight of faith, a figure who seems no different 
from an ordinary person but lives with total commitment, total involve-
ment, and total passion (see Chapter 7 for details). By the end of the 
movie, we like to think Harold Crick has become something of a secular 
knight of faith. Even Harold’s test at the end of the movie is reminiscent 
of Kierkegaard’s favorite knight of faith, Abraham (see Chapter 10). Both 
are asked to do the unthinkable, and incomprehensibly, absurdly, both 
find the courage and passion to make an impossible choice.
But perhaps what’s most existential about Stranger Than Fiction is its opti-
mism — the optimism that life doesn’t have to be rote drudgery and that the 
absurdity of life doesn’t have to defeat you. By engaging in the world passion-
ately and exercising his human dignity, Harold is able to save himself. The 
existentialists tell you that you can too.
Superbad (2007)
Superbad tells the story of three teenagers in search of sex, booze, and a 
good time. The plot is familiar, but the actors and the script have a warmth 
that transcends the typical teenage sex comedy. Seth and Evan (played by 
Jonah Hill and Michael Cera) are best friends and high-school losers who get 
invited to a party hosted by the beautiful and popular Jules (Emma Stone). 
The catch is, Seth has bragged about his ability to supply the party with alco-
holic beverages, so the two can’t show up empty-handed. To accomplish this 
task, they enlist their friend Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who’s recently 
obtained a fake ID that says that he’s 25 and that his name is McLovin. Just 

339
 Chapter 15: Ten Great Existential Movies
McLovin. Every good teenage sex comedy has one guy who even the geeks 
find embarrassing to hang around with — the loser among losers, the geek 
among geeks. In Superbad, it’s Fogell, a.k.a. McLovin.
Naturally, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. The night turns into 
a string of surreal and sometimes dangerous encounters. All the while, Seth 
and Evan argue as only best friends who truly love each other can while 
Fogell is busy being Fogell. By the end, Seth and Evan have stopped arguing 
and learned a few things about love and friendship, and Fogell has become 
who he always was: McLovin.
Every high school movie is a little existential. The history of the human race 
repeats itself, after all, in every human life. You start enmeshed in and cling-
ing to the narratives your parents have spun for you, and at some point, you 
break away. That time is filled with anguish, uncertainty, and alienation as 
you find yourself adrift from any fixed meaning while you try to find your own 
and, in true Sartrean fashion, create yourself. Seth and Evan certainly go 
through this. They’re de-centered from their traditional sense of self-identity, 
primarily in the reevaluation they make of the nature of their own friendship.
Fogell, however, makes Superbad exquisitely existential. Nietzsche tells us we 
must become who we are. He says we must create ourselves, preferably with 
some style. He speaks of the coming of a new type of man, a bold new con-
queror of himself and a free spirit. He speaks of the emergence of the 
Übermensch — the superman.
Behold the superman; behold McLovin.
What makes a character like Fogell a geek among geeks is that he’s immune, 
utterly immune, to the opinions of others. He is who he is — as bizarre and 
unacceptable as that may be (especially in high school, where individuality is 
particularly frowned upon). Seth and Evan try and fail to fit in. They aren’t 
seen as cool, but they aren’t total train wrecks either. Much of their discus-
sions have the form, “Okay, you gotta say this” and “You gotta do that.” 
The goal is to be acceptable, to fit in, to get the girl. As interesting as you, 
as a viewer, may find them, they spend much of their time fleeing their 
individuality and trying to get into the high school herd.
More specifically, Seth works at joining the herd while Evan struggles to 
come to terms with his own individuality. Meanwhile, Fogell has created him-
self in an image that may not please anyone else, but it pleases him. By the 
end of the movie, his proud statement early on, “I am McLovin,” has proved 
prophetic. His image is transformed by then, but he hasn’t become anyone he 
wasn’t from the start. In true Nietzschean fashion, his self-creation is a matter 
of sheer will, creativity, style, and self-acceptance.

E
xistentialism has been called as much a literary movement as a philo-
sophical one, and this statement contains some truth. Many of the 
existentialists at least dabbled in novels, plays, or even poetry, and a few 
became quite proficient. In fact, it has been said of the two kings of French 
existentialism that Jean-Paul Sartre was a philosopher who dabbled in litera-
ture and Albert Camus was a writer who dabbled in philosophy. We tend to 
think they were each pretty good at both, but such sentiments highlight the 
degree to which the movement was deeply involved in literary concerns.
Unlike our list of ten movies (see Chapter 15), our list of literary works is 
populated, in part at least, by full-blooded existentialists — philosophers 
straight in from the front lines. These works not only give voice to existential 
themes, but also represent a working-out and further development of the 
specific ideas these philosophers were dealing with in their more straightfor-
wardly philosophical work.
Existentialism is also considered a literary movement because of several 
authors whose works are seen as not just borrowing existential themes, but 
also as being original and independent statements of the issues with which 
the existentialists dealt. Writers like Kafka, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy are seen 
as precursors of, or even influences on, later existentialist thinking. We 
include some classics by them, move on to some great books by the heavy 
hitters of existentialism, and complete the chapter with some other terrific 
works that deal with similar themes.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Hamlet, by William Shakespeare
There’s nothing new in the world. If there ever was room to do something 
new, it seems, Shakespeare did it. Shakespeare wrote more than 200 years 
before the existentialists, yet there’s nary a theme anywhere that hasn’t 
made at least a passing appearance in his work. This fact underscores the 
fundamental truths of the human condition with which both he and the exis-
tentialists were dealing. Existentialism is considered a modern philosophy, 
but it wrestles with age-old questions.
In Hamlet, the title character must come to terms with the death of his father. 
He sees the ghost of his father, who informs Hamlet that he was murdered 
by his brother Claudius. Claudius has since married Hamlet’s mother and 
ascended to the throne of his murdered brother. In a traditional revenge trag-
edy, the rest of the play unfolds organically and inevitably. But Hamlet is 
anything but traditional, and nothing is quite as expected. Hamlet mopes, he 
questions, and he waxes . . . well, existential. Has there been a more existen-
tial line in the history of English literature than Hamlet’s query “To be, or not 
to be; that is the question”?
Hamlet reflects upon this question, the question of suicide, and upon death 
and how it’s the equal fate of kings and peasants alike. He reflects upon ques-
tions of action and certainty, justice and retribution. With his father dead, 
he finds himself in a bleak landscape where the moral order has been over-
turned and where he alone must decide what to do. Even seeing his father’s 
ghost, who tells him of Claudius’s betrayal, doesn’t settle the question of 
what to do. He considers the possibility that he may be mad, that some 
demon may be deceiving him. Kierkegaard says Abraham must ask himself 
just these sorts of questions when God asks him to sacrifice Isaac. Hamlet 
doesn’t make any kind of leap of faith, however. Rather, he devises a test to 
see what the truth is.
Hamlet is an existential hero, then, in part because he feels anguished and 
forlorn about making his decision. He can feel these feelings only because he 
doesn’t succumb to seeing his life in terms of a traditional, prewritten narra-
tive. He finally does make a choice, but like all choices, after he makes it, it’s 
out there in the world, and he can have no control over it. Virtually all the 
characters experience the absurdity of this same phenomenon. Plot after 
plot is made only to backfire in unexpected ways. One character agrees to 
spy on Hamlet but is killed when Hamlet mistakes him for Claudius. Claudius 
poisons a goblet meant for Hamlet, but his wife (Hamlet’s mother) drinks it 
instead. Finally, Hamlet does kill Claudius, dying himself in the process. 
Hamlet was the rightful king of Denmark and was to ascend to the throne 
upon killing his usurping uncle. Instead, Fortinbras, prince of rival Norway, 
appears intent on leading his army against Denmark. Finding the country 
headless already, he simply fills the vacuum and takes the throne.

Notes from the Underground, 
by Feodor Dostoevsky
I am a sick man. . . . I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I 
believe my liver is diseased. However, I know nothing at all about my dis-
ease, and do not know for certain what ails me.
So begins Dostoevsky’s masterpiece of the misanthropic. Notes from the 
Underground is the story, often told in rambling, even nonsensical terms, of 
this man, how he lives, how he sees the world. The novel is split into two 
parts. The first is basically him kvetching like this at length, taking on such 
Why existentialists love literature
Many philosophers outside existentialism 
wouldn’t touch literature with a 10-foot pole. 
Indeed, Plato initially banished poets from his 
perfect city in The Republic. On the other hand, 
the existentialists were keen on literature for 
the following reasons:
  Literature is concrete: The existentialists 
believed that each of us lives her life 
embedded in concrete situations. Indeed, 
they railed against systems that attempted 
to gloss over the specific details of our lives 
and create universal, one-size-fits-all nar-
ratives to guide us. Literature afforded them 
the opportunity to reflect the reality that all 
choices are made by real people in the con-
text of their situations.
  Literature speaks to you on an emotional 
level: Literature can be used to evoke emo-
tions without even raising the question of 
truth. For the existentialists, emotions are 
deeply valuable guideposts. Evoking the 
right emotions from you, then, can do as 
much as or more than any argument could 
to make you understand the nature of your 
situation.
  Literature is nondogmatic: Most good lit-
erature raises issues, concerns, questions, 
and emotions, and it allows you to walk in 
the shoes of another person to understand 
and appreciate a different point of view. 
Existentialists were always quick to avoid 
even the appearance of dogmatism, and 
literature allowed them to do this while 
tweaking the perceptions and emotions of 
their audience and helping them see the 
world from the existentialists’ perspective.
  Existentialism is about creation: When you 
recognize that there’s nothing, you have to 
start making something. If God is no longer 
a viable, absolute source of meaning and 
purpose, it’s up to you to create it, to remake 
yourself and the world through an act of will 
and creativity. What better way to commu-
nicate this fact, to illustrate it, and even 
undertake it than by engaging in the act of 
creation? Authors create worlds from noth-
ing, and this is precisely what your task is 
as a human being: to narrate a meaningful 
story for your life and the world that makes 
sense and has emotional resonance.

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
topics as illness, spitefulness, rationalism, and utopianism. The point that 
comes up again and again is that rational and utopian systems have it funda-
mentally wrong because they assume human beings are basically rational, 
and we’re not. In the second part of the novel, the underground man inter-
acts with the outside world. He gets into a dispute with a police officer, falls 
in love with a prostitute, but is ultimately brought down by his own pettiness 
and self-loathing. In something like a self-fulfilling prophecy, he watches as 
things fall apart.
Plato once said that “to know the good is to do the good.” When people act 
in ways that are harmful to themselves and society, it’s because on one level 
or another, they believe the act is good — that it will bring them happiness 
or success, for example. The underground man (whom Dostoevsky never 
names) rejects this kind of thinking out of hand. He speaks of his own experi-
ence of doing wrong precisely at the moment he’s most sure it’s wrong and 
describes his delight in his own degradation. If logic and rationality (of the 
type that tell you that twice two is four) are a stone wall, the underground 
man is happy to bang his head against it, even if he’ll never break through.
Although the underlying target of much of his ramblings is the utopian social-
ism that was to become so influential in the history of his native Russia, his 
irrationalism speaks to the larger urge of religious, scientific, philosophical, 
and political systems to try to provide neat, orderly answers to everything. 
What all these systems have at their center is an assumption that human 
beings, whom these systems supposedly serve, are fundamentally rational 
creatures. As such, their well-being can be served by rational calculations. 
But if human beings are irrational, we neither want, nor will be served by, 
nor will cooperate with such systems. One traditional existentialist complaint 
about these systems is that they dehumanize us. But Dostoevsky’s under-
ground man turns this on its head, stating that these systems will ultimately 
fall apart because even if they’re good for us, we’re too warped, stubborn, 
and irrational to cooperate.
The Death of Ivan Ilych, by Leo Tolstoy
The importance of death in existentialism is famous, but it’s sometimes 
misinterpreted to suggest that existentialists are always depressed, walking 
around moping and muttering about their eventual, approaching, and dismal 
end. That reputation is only half true. On the one hand, existentialists do care 
about death and finitude, but they don’t see anything ultimately depressing 
about facing up to it. If anything, they think the consequences of not facing 
death are depressing!
With that in mind, try to pick up this great Russian novel, The Death of Ivan 
Ilych. Clearly, Tolstoy, although not an existentialist himself, recognizes the 
importance of facing death if you want to live an authentic life. When you 

345
 Chapter 16: Ten Great Works of Existential Literature
avoid death, Tolstoy clearly believes (in agreement with later thinkers such 
as Heidegger) that your life tends to fall apart and lose its focus. You drift. 
You’re alive, but you’re really like a zombie. You may as well be dead!
The book starts with the wake service for the main character, Ivan Ilych. It’s 
an interesting start to the novel, because Tolstoy wants you to see that no 
one at the wake ceremony seems to be addressing the actual death of poor 
Ivan, the protagonist, and what death represents for each of the individuals 
in the room. Sure, they know he’s dead, but death has significance to them 
only in ways that allow them to avoid the actual subject of dealing with what 
death means in each of their particular lives. Instead, death turns out to be 
something totally impersonal for them all. For Ivan’s wife, his death means 
the possibility for her to receive his pension. For Ivan’s colleagues, it means a 
possible promotion in the court system (he left a vacancy, after all). For still 
others in the room, it means having to perform the right rituals, such as 
kneeling before the body and making the sign of the cross.
After setting up this theme — that people avoid the realities of death — 
Tolstoy takes you back into time, back to just before the time when Ivan con-
tracts the disease that eventually winds up killing him. As the story proceeds 
and Ivan contracts his illness, Tolstoy masterfully shows how Ivan is no dif-
ferent about the subject of his own death from the guests at his eventual 
wake at the start of the book. Instead of facing up to his own finitude, Ivan 
hides inside a whirlwind of distractions, all of which succeed in allowing him 
to concentrate on achieving worldly and community success. He redecorates 
his house, he plays cards with the right people, he networks. He’s intimately 
concerned with assuring that they think he’s living the right kind of life.
As the book progresses, Ivan begins to recognize what’s happening to him. 
Tolstoy beautifully explains how this starts to change the ways Ivan sees his 
world; the social network that once meant so much to him begins to mean 
nothing. He begins to suffer from the recognition that no one around him 
sees him as a person or an individual, but simply as a social role. In avoiding 
the subject of his death, they avoid him, and he feels it. How does it end for 
Ivan? Well, you know he dies. But does he first completely face up to his 
mortality? Read this short masterpiece and find out!
The Trial, by Franz Kafka
If The Trial had been written after writers like Sartre and Camus, it would be 
tempting to read it as a relatively straightforward parable reflecting the way 
human beings are condemned to be free; condemned to try to make sense of 
a world that refuses to be sensible; and, of course, condemned to death. As it 

346
Part V: The Part of Tens 
is, the book is wonderfully elusive and refuses any such simple, direct inter-
pretation. Denying its existential themes — anguish; forlornness; death; the 
elusiveness of answers to your most basic questions; and, most important, 
the fundamental absurdity of life — is difficult, however.
The predicament of The Trial’s protagonist, Josef K., is certainly absurd. One 
day, he’s abruptly arrested and told he’s on trial. He’s never told what he’s 
being accused of. In fact, K. is shortly allowed to go home and, despite the 
title, doesn’t really spend any time at trial. He spends much of the book in a 
fruitless attempt to understand and gain access to the mechanizations of the 
law. He tries to hire a lawyer, but the lawyer is as unhelpful as the men who 
arrest him. Whatever he does, it seems, a sentence is hanging over him, and 
he has no way to get answers as to why or what he can do about it.
In what many consider the centerpiece of the story, a priest discusses his 
case with him. The priest, whom K. seemingly meets by chance, knows about 
his case and tells him it isn’t going well. In the course of the conversation, he 
tells K. that K. is deluded about the nature of the law, and he tells K. a para-
ble to help him understand. In the parable, a man from the country tries to 
gain admittance to an entrance to the law. A doorkeeper repeatedly refuses 
to let him in. The man grows old and eventually dies trying to gain access. At 
the end of his life, the doorkeeper tells him that this entrance was meant only 
for him.
This, of course, is absurd. K. objects to what he sees as the dishonesty of the 
doorkeeper, to which the priest responds that what matters isn’t the truth of 
things, but their necessity. This sums up K.’s situation in many ways. He’s 
stuck in the inexorable movement of a machine. The truth of his innocence, 
as well as all human truth and humanity itself, is irrelevant. All that matters is 
the movement of the machine.
It’s worth noting at this point that Kafka himself, like K. in the story, was a 
bureaucrat. The world of The Trial is filled with nameless, faceless functionar-
ies carrying out the perceived necessity of the system of which they’re 
merely parts. The absurdity K. faces, then, isn’t just the absurdity of life, but 
also the absurdity of the impersonal and absolute systems that human beings 
create to manage their interactions with and understanding of that life. Like 
the man from the country in the parable, K. is kept at arm’s length from the 
truth he seeks by all the mechanizations of the law and all its functionaries.
But ultimately, the joy of Kafka’s The Trial is that, like K.’s situation, the 
book is so inscrutable. What matters isn’t so much discovering a final, true, 
one-to-one correspondence between its events and themes and existential 
notions about the nature of life. What matters are the very direct and visceral 
emotions it conveys and the vague sense you get from reading it that there’s 
a very deep truth here. That truth alters your perceptions of what it means 
to be alive and resonates powerfully with the works of the existentialists. 
Fittingly enough, Kafka left The Trial unfinished at his death. Although you 
know K.’s ultimate fate, you, like he, may never fully understand it.

 Chapter 16: Ten Great Works of Existential Literature
The Stranger, by Albert Camus
Quite simply, The Stranger is the existential novel. The lead character, 
Meursault, goes through life with flattened emotions. He takes great joy in 
physicality, whether it’s making love to his lover, Marie, or going for a swim. 
Mostly, however, he wanders, aimless and detached. He attends his mother’s 
funeral but doesn’t cry or become upset. When asked to involve himself in a 
cruel scheme of revenge by a neighbor upon his girlfriend, he agrees with a 
morally noncommittal shrug. In the central action of the book, he walks along 
a beach and sees an Arab. His friends recently had a fight with some Arabs, 
including this one, while he was present. He could walk away, but he contin-
ues forward in a detached haze. When the Arab pulls a knife, Meursault, with-
out really thinking or deciding to do it, pulls out a gun and shoots the man.
The Stranger is a short but rich novel. Among other things, it’s about alien-
ation and about how most of the time people wander through life without 
really recognizing its meaninglessness or absurdity. As the deadpan 
Meursault illustrates, this isn’t necessarily a good thing. Only when some-
thing dramatic happens do people start to reevaluate things and see them in 
a different way. Meursault’s transformation after killing the Arab and being 
sentenced to death is largely one of perception. Being in prison, he doesn’t 
have the freedom to change the way he lives his life. But the way he under-
stands and interprets life does change, as does the way he interprets the 
death sentence to which he has been condemned.
Many existential works deal with death, but few do so as passionately and 
succinctly as The Stranger. As Meursault faces his own death, he finally starts 
to understand the meaninglessness and absurdity of life. At the same time, he 
gains a new appreciation for living. He says he finally understands, for exam-
ple, why his mother got involved with a man and made plans for marriage in 
the nursing home just before death. He rejects the judgment of the court not 
because he embraces his crime, but because he considers the court unfit to 
judge him. In facing his own mortality, he understands what he took from the 
Arab in a way the court doesn’t. Perhaps nowhere is the essence of existen-
tialism more succinctly put than in Meursault’s observation concerning the 
priest who comes to visit him as he waits for his execution. The priest, he 
says, didn’t know he was alive because he didn’t know he was going to die. 
The same could be said of the court that has sentenced him.
In the end, he faces his sentence hoping only to be greeted by the “cries of 
hate.” It’s a final act of rebellion reminiscent of Camus’s hero Sisyphus (see 
Chapter 5 for more about Sisyphus). He embraces the absurdity of his situa-
tion and, much like Sisyphus, rejects the interpretation of his situation 
imposed by those who have foisted it upon him. By embracing life passion-
ately at its end, he rejects the death sentence imposed by both the court and 
by the universe.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
No Exit, by Jean-Paul Sartre
Sartre says again and again in all his works that your choices make you who 
you are. You’re the product of your own self-creation. Your will and creativity 
unite to boldly make a being that starts as nothing into something. It’s a 
macho story of action and lone wolf individuality. You rely on no one and 
make of the world what you will.
The nagging problem is that after you ascend the mountaintop to stand 
proud and majestic, surveying all you’ve accomplished and all you are, one 
of your friends can always walk up behind you and say, “Wow, dude, you 
really look kinda goofy in those shorts.” You’re constantly defining and inter-
preting the world before you, but for other people, you’re not the center of 
the universe; you’re just one more object in their universe to be interpreted 
and defined. Yet you live among them, you both need and want to interact 
with them, and you crave and desire their love and approval. But as soon as 
you seek them, you put yourself in jeopardy by making yourself (or allowing 
them to make you) into an object.
This is the existential dilemma posed by Sartre’s play No Exit. The three 
characters, Garcin, Estelle, and Inez, are in hell. At the beginning of the play, 
Garcin is brought to a simple drawing room where all the action takes place. 
Inez and then Estelle soon follow, and the three characters engage in an 
extended conversation in which they fluctuate in their allegiances and affec-
tions, at turns seeking validation from one or the other companion, accepting 
and then rejecting each other’s approaches. The recurring theme is that 
people need and want validation from one another but are fundamentally 
separated and incapable of getting it. As Garcin puts it in the play’s most 
famous line:
So this is hell. I’d never have believed it. You remember all we were 
told about the torture chambers, the fire and brimstone, the “burning 
marl.” Old wives’ tales! There’s no need for red-hot pokers. Hell is 
other people!
What makes No Exit a masterpiece is the way it takes grand psychological 
and existential themes and has them play out in a way that, despite the 
eccentric storyline, is essentially familiar. The intimacy of the characters’ 
conversations at times seems strange for characters who have just met, but 
the emotions they express are thoroughly familiar. You can feel for these 
characters because you understand their needs and disappointments. Sartre 
may be wrong, and there may indeed be a way to bridge the gap between two 
consciousnesses, each trying to define itself. But it’s certainly not easy, and 
No Exit is a brilliant explication of the perils you face when trying.

The Blood of Others may be subtitled Exit This Way. Whereas Sartre is con-
vinced that human relationships are inherently frustrated by needs that 
can’t be met (see the section on his book No Exit earlier in this chapter), de 
Beauvoir is convinced that your relationships with others are essential to 
your freedom and its expression. She explains this philosophically in The 
Ethics of Ambiguity but illustrates and communicates it brilliantly in this 
masterpiece of fiction.
The story concerns two main characters, Jean and Helene. Jean is a young 
bourgeois who can’t bear the weight of responsibility that all people bear for 
their actions. He runs from this responsibility, particularly in the realm of 
politics; after a friend dies in a police raid on their Communist meeting, he 
becomes neutral and apolitical. When the Germans invade Paris, however, 
he finds he can no longer run away, and he joins the French Resistance. 
Helene is a passionate free spirit. She considers herself to be someone who 
never thinks of others, but in reality, she finds herself living through her 
lovers. She is likewise shaken by the invasion and eventually gets involved in 
the Resistance.
On one level, the book is about how these two people learn to live authentic 
lives by taking full responsibility for their choices. But it’s deeper than that, 
because it’s also about how others must be involved in those choices. Sartre 
believed that people always experience one another as objects and that this 
is inherently destructive of their freedom. The Blood of Others reflects de 
Beauvoir’s insight that although we can see one another as objects (and this 
is oppressive and destructive to each of us), it isn’t the only possible way for 
us to interact.
Even de Beauvoir’s use of pronouns heightens your awareness of the ambigu-
ous nature of our relationships. The book itself vacillates between Jean’s 
first-person voice and an impersonal third-person perspective. Within Jean’s 
narration, he wavers between the pronoun you (as though he were speaking 
directly to Helene) and third-person pronouns such as she. This mimics 
elements of the action later in the story. When Jean chooses to engage in 
sabotage, he does so knowing the Germans will respond by killing innocent 
French prisoners. In this case, Jean is choosing death for these people, and 
their wishes or choices play no part. In that sense, he’s objectifying them in 
his attempt to foil the Germans.
But as Jean finally learns to accept, his role as leader isn’t just a matter of 
choosing by himself to risk and sacrifice others. When it comes to the lives 
of his comrades working in the Resistance, the situation is significantly 

350
Part V: The Part of Tens 
different from the case of the innocent prisoners. Those people in the 
Resistance choose, for their own reasons, to align themselves with him and 
to make their sacrifices. Interacting with these people in a way that doesn’t 
turn them into objects is not only possible, but also essential. They freely 
choose to join the Resistance and sacrifice their lives, which allows him to 
bring his own project to fruition. Likewise, his free choice to make use of 
them allows them to fulfill their convergent goals.
When presented like this, it all sounds very obvious. But the truth is, people 
often have trouble recognizing and affirming the free choices of others. We 
fall into treating people as objects out of selfishness, thoughtlessness, or 
even (as is the case with Jean) an overdeveloped sense of responsibility. 
Both Helene and Jean slowly develop a recognition of their need for others 
on multiple levels. In the end, this recognition frees them.
Waiting for Godot, by Samuel Beckett
Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters in Samuel Beckett’s tragicomic 
play Waiting for Godot, do nothing. They sit. They talk. They wait. And while 
they wait, they try to pass the time. They’re aided in this attempt by the pass-
ing Pozzo and his servant, Lucky. In the first act, Lucky entertains them by 
dancing and thinking. (Yes, thinking.) In the second act, Pozzo is blind and 
Lucky is dumb. They don’t remember meeting Vladimir and Estragon the 
night before. At the end of each act, a boy appears and tells the characters 
that Godot won’t be arriving today but will definitely be here tomorrow.
Much of the action of the play is repetitious and absurd. You never find out 
who Godot is or why they wait for him, but they seem unable to stop waiting 
even when they try. Indeed, they often decide upon a course of action only to 
remain immobile. They consider suicide to escape the emptiness of their end-
less wait but decide against it principally because they don’t have effective 
rope. Estragon repeatedly suggests they leave but is reminded by Vladimir 
that they can’t because they’re waiting for Godot.
Waiting for Godot doesn’t line up point for point with any existential philoso-
phy, but it raises fundamental existential questions and problems that all the 
existential philosophies attempt to address. The play explicitly has the char-
acters recognize that they represent all humanity. Godot is traditionally inter-
preted as being God, but even this is open to debate. Beyond that, the play 
is wonderfully open to interpretation and, at the same time, resistant to any 
single interpretation. Much of its significance lies in its evocative nature 
and ability to elicit a direct emotional recognition of desolation, anguish, and 
forlornness.

 Chapter 16: Ten Great Works of Existential Literature
Still, a lot of what’s going on is worth noticing. Here are some things to notice 
and questions to ask yourself while reading it or seeing it performed:
 
 Is meaningful action impossible in a world without God, or is meaningful 
action impossible only while you’re waiting for God, while you continue 
to look to an absent God to supply your meaning?
 
 Why do Vladimir and Estragon decide that suicide is an appropriate 
response to their situation? Is it? In the end, of course, they don’t 
go through with it. Why are they unable even to perform this act of 
surrender?
 
 Estragon identifies himself with Adam. Where’s Eve, and would they be 
better off with her around to pick some apples?
 
 Who are Pozzo and Lucky, and why are they there?
 
 For all the absurdity of the play, do you see something familiar here? In 
what sense are you like Vladimir and Estragon?
Interview with the Vampire, 
by Anne Rice
When it came out in 1976, Interview with the Vampire redefined and reawak-
ened the vampire subgenre. It tells the story of Louis, a 200-year-old vampire 
in search of meaning. The most groundbreaking thing about the book is the 
way it humanizes the vampire, making it psychologically and spiritually 
normal, rather than some bestial creature of pure desire or a half-alive shade 
of pure evil.
Transformed in this way, the vampire ceases to be a mere external threat or 
some powerful force of sexuality and violence that the human characters 
must survive. Rice’s work allows you to step directly into the vampire world 
and develop the vampire story from the inside out. In Interview, she uses this 
device brilliantly to tell of an existential search for meaning.
The story begins and ends in New Orleans. Louis tells how he was turned into 
a vampire by the flamboyant, callous, and thoroughly amoral Lestat. 
Believing the tales he’s always heard, he naturally assumes that he has 
become a creature of pure evil. He quickly finds, however, that he still has a 
conscience, and he can pick up crosses freely and take a bath in holy water if 
he wants.

352
Part V: The Part of Tens 
This drives Louis crazy. He’s a moral vampire, horrified by what he has 
become. Surely, he feels, something as traumatic and terrible as becoming 
a vampire must have an obvious meaning. Surely now that he has become a 
supernatural creature, he must have some kind of direct knowledge, or at 
least direct sense, of God and the Devil, good and evil.
But this isn’t the case. As his “father” Lestat repeatedly tries to teach him, 
there is no meaning. Louis, Lestat believes, should learn to enjoy the power 
and decadence of vampirism with the same relish that he does. But this isn’t 
an option for the pensive Louis. He resists Lestat’s tutelage, tries to survive 
on the blood of animals, and continues to question. Eventually, after being 
subjected to many of Lestat’s sadistic and manipulative schemes, Louis 
breaks from the man who made him a vampire and goes in search of answers. 
But of course, he never finds any. Everyone he meets is just trying to fill the 
huge void of eternity — with knowledge; with love; with destruction; or, in 
one of the book’s most prevalent themes, with beauty. The book is beauti-
fully sensuous and drips with eroticism and passion for the physicality of the 
characters and their surroundings.
Using vampires instead of humans to describe the human search for meaning 
allows Rice to shift perspective in two ways:
 
 The vampire point of view: Like the movie Blade Runner (see Chapter 
15), Interview brilliantly uses nonhuman characters to help you take a 
fresh look at very human questions and problems. The vampires look at 
human beings from a vantage point you generally don’t have access to 
and are able to see truths that people often miss when seeing things 
from the ground level, so to speak.
 
 Awakening your inner vampire: Vampires, when they’re turned, wake 
to a new world. Their senses are heightened; they see things they never 
saw before. Similarly, when you look at the vampires struggling with 
very human issues, the drama and intensity of the vampire mythology 
color and heighten your perceptions. That drama awakens you to the 
powerful mystery and significance of existence, something you normally 
take for granted. Rice’s powerfully provocative prose is particularly 
adept at doing this.
The book also includes a wonderful convergence of existential and vampiric 
themes. Take, for example the following:
 
 Death becomes them: Existentialists aren’t concerned with just the 
meaning of life, but also with the meaning of life given the reality of 
death. Because death isn’t inevitable for vampires, they’re a perfect 
medium for exploring the significance death and how its presence or 
absence affects the value of a life. All vampire stories are about death. 
They kill others to stay alive, but more important, vampires are the 
undead. They’re defined by what they are not. By redefining and putting 
into question what it means to be undead, Rice simultaneously raises 
the question of what it means to be alive.

353
 Chapter 16: Ten Great Works of Existential Literature
 
 Sensuality versus the eternal: Traditional philosophic and religious 
systems sharply divide the realm of the eternal and the temporal. We 
here in the dirt on earth are separated in a fundamental way from the 
perfection of mathematics, God’s heaven, and everything eternal. The 
existentialists try to refocus not just attention, but value, on earth. 
Nietzsche in particular is keen on instigating a wholesale transformation 
of values that would extol the natural world, as the only world available 
to extol. (Chapter 3 talks about this in more detail.) Louis’s transforma-
tion is a wonderful allegory for this transformation of perspective. 
When he becomes a vampire, when he becomes eternal, he finds that 
it doesn’t lead to any grand revelation of truth. He finds there’s nothing 
more to existence than the world as he knows it. The eternal is the 
temporal, only longer. Yet his perception of that world is heightened, 
and he’s able to see it more vividly and intensely than ever before. 
If he could embrace what he sees there, as Lestat does, his existential 
transformation would be complete.
Rice wasn’t trying to write an existential novel. At the time she wrote 
Interview, she says, she thought she was an atheist, and those themes seeped 
into the novel. But like any good writer, she’s able to find the universal in her 
personal concerns. The result is a brilliant explication, whether intentional or 
not, of central existential questions and themes.
Run with the Hunted, 
by Charles Bukowski
If one of the misanthropic characters from an existential novel got up and 
walked around in real life, he’d probably look a lot like Charles Bukowski. 
Bukowski was one of America’s greatest and most controversial poets and 
novelists. Alienated, alcoholic, lonely, poor, and even homeless for long 
stretches of his life, he wrote semi-autobiographically about the world he 
lived in, a world of flophouses and bars, racetracks and menial jobs, prisons, 
hospitals, and graveyards. Oh, and libraries. Being homeless and/or unem-
ployed much of his life, he spent vast quantities of time in them, reading 
voraciously without guidance or structure, bias or preconception.
A literary man without pedigree, Bukowski didn’t write about an existential 
perspective; he lived it. He once said of Camus that he wrote about death like 
a man who had just had a fine steak dinner. In his late middle age, he became 
famous and successful, but for much of his life, there were few steak dinners 
for Charles Bukowski.
Run with the Hunted is a posthumous collection of his short stories, poems, 
and excerpts from his novels, arranged “chronologically” — not in the order 
he wrote them, but in the order of the period of his life from which they’re 

354
Part V: The Part of Tens 
taken. The result is a fictionalized biography, a literary portrait of the man as 
he re-created himself in his work. It’s an act of self-creation, and in that there 
is, of course, some artifice. But what strikes the reader is the degree to which 
his writing is raw, unvarnished, and uncolored by romanticism or apology. In 
true existential fashion, he stubbornly refuses to look away from the world as 
it is. What emerges is a kind of existential saint, one who adheres to no moral 
code but who consistently acts in what Sartre calls “good faith,” seeing the 
world and acting within it in a way that’s totally honest and doesn’t abdicate 
responsibility.
The world he presents isn’t one you’d normally call pretty, but it’s often 
beautiful despite Bukowski’s refusal to doll it up. His characters and situa-
tions all have an immediacy and an intense humanity. Many of his poems 
read almost like personal letters, and you get the rare experience of feeling 
a direct, unadorned connection to the writer and, ironically, to all humanity 
and our shared human condition.
Bukowski certainly has his nihilistic tendencies, which would place him in 
direct opposition to the existentialists. Much of his work is deeply cynical, 
even resigned. But poems like “Nirvana” and “The World’s Greatest Loser” 
help illuminate, in a way no philosophy (and perhaps no novel) could, the 
beauty and wonder that you can see in this imperfect world when you accept 
it as it is without falsifying it or romanticizing it, and without hiding its 
scars or justifying its ugliness in terms of some more perfect world of which 
it is a part.
Bukowski arranged for his tombstone to read simply, “Don’t try.” Acceptance 
or surrender? Maybe a bit of both.
