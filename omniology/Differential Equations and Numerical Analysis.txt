Preface
This book is the consolidation of the selected articles by the participants of the
International Winter Workshop on Differential Equations and Numerical Analysis
(DEANA 2015), held during 5–7 January 2015 at Bishop Heber College,
Tiruchirappalli, India. Though the conference was intended to accommodate works
on differential equations, the main concentration was on equations whose solutions
and their derivatives are non-smooth with singularities related to boundary layers.
Most of the works were on singular perturbation problems whose solutions exhibit
initial/interior/boundary layers and occur in many physical phenomena.
With the presentation of the paper “On the motion of ﬂuids with very little
friction” by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904, in the International Congress of Mathematics,
held in Heidelberg, Germany, the ﬁeld of classical ﬂuid dynamics got revolution-
ized. This led to the development of boundary layer theory and singular pertur-
bation problems. Typically, these problems arise in various ﬁelds of applied
mathematics such as ﬂuid dynamics (boundary layer problems), elasticity (edge
effect in shells), quantum mechanics (WKB problems), electrical networks,
chemical reactions, control theory, gas porous electrodes theory and many other
areas. The Navier–Stokes’ equation with a large Reynolds number is one of the
most striking examples of singular perturbation problems.
The aim of the conference was to give the young researchers the core of the
subject for which pioneers in this area of research were invited from India and
abroad. The invited talks were given by Prof. John J.H. Miller, Professor Emeritus,
Trinity College, Dublin and Director, INCA, Dublin, Ireland; Prof. Eugene
O’Riordan, School of Mathematical Sciences, Dublin City University, Ireland; Prof.
N. Ramanujam, Honorary Professor, Department of Mathematics, Bharathidasan
University, Tiruchirappalli, India; Dr. S. Valarmathi, Associate Professor and Head,
Department of Mathematics, Bishop Heber College, Tiruchirappalli, India; and a
few others. Also, there were contributions from various researchers working on
differential equations and numerical analysis.
The book consists of two parts. Part I includes lectures by the invited speakers.
The chapter “Elementary Tutorial on Numerical Methods for Singular Perturbation
v

Problems” gives a tutorial on singular perturbation problems. The chapter entitled
“Interior Layers in Singularly Perturbed Problems” presents an introduction to interior
layers occurring in the solution of singular perturbation problems. In the chapter
“Singularly Perturbed Delay Differential Equations and Numerical Methods”, an
introduction about the applications and various methods of solving delay differential
equations are presented. In the chapter “Initial or Boundary Value Problems for
Systems of Singularly Perturbed Differential Equations and Their Solution Proﬁle”, a
sketch of the analytical and numerical results for initial/boundary value problems for
systems of singularly perturbed differential equations is given. In Part II, six refereed
contributions of people working in the area of singular perturbation problems are
included.

Elementary Tutorial on Numerical Methods
for Singular Perturbation Problems
John J.H. Miller
Abstract In the ﬁrst section we introduce a simple singularly perturbed initial value
problem for a ﬁrst order linear differential equation. We construct the backward Euler
ﬁnite difference method for this problem. We then discuss continuous and discrete
maximum principles for the associated continuous and discrete operators and we
conclude the section by deﬁning what is meant by a parameter-uniform numerical
method. In the second section we introduce a ﬁtted operator method on a uniform
mesh for our simple initial value problem deﬁned in the previous section. We then
prove rigorously that this method is parameter-uniform at the mesh points. Fitted
mesh methods on piecewise uniform meshes are introduced in the third section. A
ﬁtted mesh method for our simple initial value problem is constructed. It is proved
rigorously that this method is parameter-uniform at the mesh points. Finally, in the
fourth section, numerical solutions of singular perturbation problems are discussed.
Computations using standard and a parameter-uniform numerical method are pre-
sented. The usefulness and reliability of parameter-uniform methods is demonstrated.

Introduction to Singular Perturbation Problems
and Their Numerical Solution
We begin with a brief introduction to singular perturbation problems for differential
equations by describing the concepts in terms of a simple linear problem and a
maximum principle.
We consider the simple singularly perturbed ﬁrst order initial value problem (Pε)
on the interval Ω = (0, T ]

ε + a(t)uε = f (t), t ∈Ω,
(1)
uε(0) given,
(2)
where, for all t ∈Ω, a(t) ≥α and 0 < ε ≤1.
We are interested in designing a numerical method which gives good approxima-
tions to the solution of (Pε), regardless of the value of ε, in the entire range 0 < ε ≤1.
It can be seen from the exact solution of this problem that, as ε →0, the gradient
of the solution becomes increasingly steep as we approach t = 0. We say that the
solution has a layer at the point t = 0. In this case it is called an initial layer, because
it is associated with a boundary point where an initial condition is speciﬁed. In the
analysis that follows it becomes clear that the width of this layer is O(ε).
To analyse such problems, and their numerical solutions, we introduce some
norms and semi-norms. For singular perturbation problems it is important to work
in the maximum norm. We deﬁne the maximum norm of a differentiable function on
a set S by
Deﬁnition 1.1 |φ|S = supt∈S |φ(t)|
and, for any positive integer k, we deﬁne the kth order semi-norm of a differentiable
function on a set S by
Deﬁnition 1.2 |φ|k,S = supt∈S |φ(k)(t)|.
For k = 0, the semi-norm becomes the maximum norm. Note that when the meaning
is clear the subscript S is usually dropped from the notation.
For some T > 0, let Ω = (0, T ] and Ω = [0, T ].
For convenience we introduce the differential operator
Lε = ε d
dt + a(t), a(t) > α > 0, for all t ∈Ω.
The operator Lε satisﬁes the following maximum principle.
Lemma 1.1 Let ψ(t) be any function in the domain of Lε such that ψ(0) ≥0. Then
Lεψ(t) ≥0 for all t ∈Ω implies that ψ(t) ≥0 for all t ∈Ω.
Proof Let t∗be such that ψ(t∗) = mint ψ(t) and assume that the lemma is false.
Then ψ(t∗) < 0. From the hypotheses we have t∗̸= 0 and ψ′(t∗) ≤0. Thus
Lεψ(t∗) = εψ′(t∗) + a(t∗)ψ(t∗) < 0,
which contradicts the assumption.
This leads immediately to the following stability result.
Lemma 1.2 Let ψ(t) be any function in the domain of Lε. Then
|ψ(t)| ≤max{|ψ(0)|, 1
α|Lεψ|} for all t ∈Ω.

Proof Deﬁne the two functions
θ±(t) = max{|ψ(0)|, 1
α|Lεψ|} ± ψ(t).
It is not hard to verify that θ±(0) ≥0 and Lεθ±(t) ≥0. It follows from Lemma 1.1
that θ±(t) ≥0, for all t ∈Ω, as required.
In order to discuss numerical solutions we need to discretise the domain Ω =
(0, T ]. The simplest discretisation is a uniform mesh having N sub-intervals of
equal length h, which is determined by a set of N + 1 equally spaced mesh points
Ω N
h = {ti}N
i=0. Here, t0 = 0, tN = T , and, for any i, 1 ≤i ≤N, h = ti −ti−1.
Uniformmeshesareadequateforﬁttedoperatormethods,butnon-uniformmeshes
are used for ﬁtted mesh methods. Piecewise-uniform meshes are the simplest kind
of non-uniform mesh. We will be interested in piecewise-uniform meshes, where the
transition point between the two uniform meshes is specially chosen. This choice
depends on the problem under consideration.
We now consider discrete solutions. We ﬁrst need to introduce the forward, back-
ward, centered and second order ﬁnite difference operators D+ D−D0
δ2, where,
on an arbitrary mesh Ω N = {ti}N
i=0,
D+U(t j) = U(t j+1) −U(t j)
t j+1 −t j
, D−U(t j) = U(t j) −U(t j−1)
t j −t j−1
D0U(t j) = U(t j+1) −U(t j−1)
t j+1 −t j−1
, δ2U(t j) = D+U(t j) −D−U(t j)
(t j+1 −t j−1)/2
.
Using these we can now deﬁne our ﬁnite difference methods. For example, the
backward Euler ﬁnite difference method for (Pε) is the following ﬁnite difference
method (P N
ε )
εD−U N + a(t)U N = f,
U N(0) = u(0),
or in operator form
L N
ε U N = f,
U N(0) = u(0),
where the ﬁnite difference operator is deﬁned by
L N
ε = εD−+ a(t)I.
We have the following discrete maximum principle for L N
ε analogous to the contin-
uous case.
Lemma 1.3 ForanymeshfunctionΨ N,theinequalitiesΨ N(0) ≥0 and LεNΨ N(t j)
≥0 for 1 ≤j ≤N, imply that Ψ N(t j) ≥0 for all j, 0 ≤j ≤N.

J.J.H. Miller
Proof Let j∗be such that Ψ N(t j∗) = min j Ψ N(t j) and assume that the lemma is
false. Then Ψ N(t j∗) < 0. From the hypotheses we have j∗̸= 0 and Ψ N(t j∗) −
Ψ N(t j∗−1) ≤0. Thus
L N
ε Ψ N(t j∗) = εΨ N(t j∗) −Ψ N(t j∗−1)
δ j∗
+ a(t j∗)Ψ N(t j∗) ≤a(t j∗)Ψ N(t j∗) < 0,
which contradicts the assumption, as required.
An immediate consequence of this is the following discrete stability result anal-
ogous to the continuous result.
Lemma 1.4 For any mesh function Ψ N, we have
|Ψ N(t j)| ≤max{|Ψ N(0)|, 1
α|L N
ε Ψ N|}, 0 ≤j ≤N.
Proof Deﬁne the two mesh functions
Θ N
± (t) = max{|Ψ N(0)|, 1
α|L N
ε Ψ N|} ± Ψ N(t).
It is not hard to verify that Θ N
± (0) ≥0 and L N
ε Θ N
± (t j) ≥0. It follows from Lemma
1.3 that Θ N
± (t j) ≥0 for all 0 ≤j ≤N.
We now consider estimates of the local truncation error, which will be required
later in our proofs of parameter-uniform convergence. In particular, we give two
distinct estimates of the local truncation error in approximating d
dt by D−, that is we
consider |(D−−d
dt )φ| for any differentiable function φ.
First, we observe that, at any mesh point ti,
(D−−d
dt )φ(ti) = φ(ti) −φ(ti−1)
ti −ti−1
−φ′(ti) =
1
ti −ti−1
 ti
ti−1
(φ′(s) −φ′(ti))ds
and so
|(D−−d
dt )φ(ti)| ≤
1
ti −ti−1
 ti
ti−1
(|φ′(s)| + |φ′(ti)|)ds ≤2|φ|1,[ti−1,ti ].
(3)
Secondly, integrating by parts, we obtain
(D−−d
dt )φ(ti) = φ(ti) −φ(ti−1)
ti −ti−1
−φ′(ti) =
1
ti −ti−1
 ti
ti−1
(ti−1 −s)φ′′(s)ds
and it follows that

|(D−−d

ti −ti−1
 ti
ti−1
(s −ti−1)|φ′′(s)|ds ≤1
2(ti −ti−1)|φ|2,[ti,ti−1].
(4)
We now deﬁne what is meant by a parameter-uniform numerical method for a
family of singular perturbation problems.
It is important to note that in this deﬁnition, and throughout the remainder of this
tutorial, C denotes a generic constant that is independent of the singular perturbation
parameter ε.
Deﬁnition 1.3 Consider a family of problems (Pε) parameterised by the singular
perturbation parameter ε, 0 < ε ≤1. Suppose that the exact solution uε is approx-
imated by the sequence of numerical solutions {U N
ε }∞
N=1, deﬁned on meshes Ω N
ε ,
where N is the discretization parameter. Then, the numerical solutions U N
ε are said
to converge ε-uniformly to the exact solution uε, if there exists a positive integer N0,
and positive numbers C and p, all independent of N and ε, such that, for all N ≥N0,
sup
0<ε≤1
|U N
ε −uε|Ω N
ε ≤C N −p,
(5)
where |.|Ω N
ε is the maximum norm on Ω N
ε .
We now derive two useful consequences of the stability of Lε established in Lemma
1.2. The ﬁrst is an a priori bound on the solution of (Pε). It is an immediate corollary
to Lemma 1.2.
Corollary 1.1 Let uε be the solution of (Pε). Then,
|uε| ≤|uε(0)| + 1
α| f |.
The second establishes the uniqueness of the solution.
Corollary 1.2 If (Pε) has a solution, it is unique.
Proof Let u1, u2 be any two solutions of (Pε) and consider z = u1 −u2. Then it is
easy to see that
z(0) = z1(0) −z2(0) = 0 and
Lεz = Lε(u1 −u2) = Lεu1 −Lεu2 = f −f = 0.
Hence z is a solution of (Pε) in the special case with homogeneous initial condition
and homogeneous differential equation. Applying Corollary1.1in this case gives,
for all t ∈Ω,
|z(t)| ≤|z(0)| + 1
α|Lεz| ≤0.
We conclude that |u1(t) −u2(t)| = 0, for all t ∈Ω, and so u1 = u2.
The next lemma provides additional classical a priori bounds on the solution of the
problem (Pε) and its derivatives.

J.J.H. Miller
Lemma 1.5 Let uε be the solution of (Pε). Then, we have
|uε|k ≤Cε−k, for each k, 0 ≤k ≤2.
Proof For k = 0 the required result is simply Corollary1.1. For k = 1 we use the
differential equation as follows. We have
u′
ε(t) = ε−1( f (t) −a(t)uε(t))
and so
|u′
ε| ≤ε−1(| f | + |a||uε|) ≤Cε−1
as required. The result for k = 2 follows from this result and the differential equation
again. We have
u′′
ε(t) = ε−1( f ′(t) −a(t)u′
ε(t) −a′(t)uε(t))
and so
|u′′|ε ≤ε−1(| f ′| + |a||u′
ε| + |a′||uε|) ≤Cε−1(1 + ε−1 + 1) ≤Cε−2,
which completes the proof.
There are discrete analogues to the above. For example, the following analogue to
Corollary1.1 is an immediate consequence of Lemma 1.4.
Corollary 1.3 Let U N
ε be the solution of (P N
ε ). Then,
|U N
ε | ≤|U N
ε (0)| + 1
α| f |.

Fitted Operator Methods
In this section a simple result from [1] is proved. The aim is to explain the proof
as clearly as possible by including some helpful details that were omitted from the
book. Consider again the initial value problem (Pε)
Lεuε(t) ≡εu′
ε(t) + a(t)uε(t) = f (t),

and expand it in a two-term Taylor series about the point ρ = 0, to obtain

for some ξ, 0 < ξ < ρ. Noting that F(0) = 0, this leads to

Since a(ti + h
2) −a(ti) = h
2a′(ti + η), for some η, 0 < η < h

|C1| ≤Chμh

sinh( 1

(10)
because

Likewise, it is not hard to see that the coefﬁcient of f (ih) can be written in the form

a(ti) −a(ti + h

a(ti + h

and it follows that
|C2| ≤|C1| + C′h ≤Ch

as required.
Finally, the coefﬁcient of f ′ is
C3 = h

1 −e−ρa(ti+ h

(12)
Combining the separate estimates (10), (11) and (12) we conclude that
|Lh

(13)
Using Lemma 1.4 we then obtain
|u

which is an estimate, at the common mesh points, of the difference between the
discrete solutions on the two meshes.
Suppose now that, for any function F, |F(h) −F( h
2)| ≤Ch p for all h, 0 < h ≤
h0, and some positive number p. Then, using the hypothesis repeatedly, we get, for
all positive integers n,

|F(h) −F( h

Taking the limit, as n →∞, we get
|F(h) −F(0)| ≤Ch p

Applying this result to F(h) = uh
ε(ti), with p = 1, we conclude from (13) and the
consistency and stability of (Ph
ε ), that
|(uh
ε −uε)(ti)| ≤Ch.
Therefore (Ph
ε ) is a parameter-uniform ﬁtted operator method for solving the singular
perturbation problem (Pε).

Fitted Mesh Methods
The aim of this section is to use the ﬁtted mesh method to solve the simple problem
(Pε) introduced above and to prove that it is parameter-uniform. We use a general
method of proof, deliberately avoiding any simpliﬁcations that could arise due to the
simplicity of the problem. Our purpose is to illustrate the general method of proof
in this simple setting.
The ﬁtted mesh method (Ph
ε ) consists of the backward Euler ﬁnite difference
operator on a specially constructed non-uniform mesh Ω N
ε
Lh
εU N
ε (ti) ≡εD−U N
ε (ti) + a(ti)U N
ε (ti) = f (ti), ti ∈Ω N
ε ,
uh
ε(0) = uε(0),
where Ω N
ε is a carefully constructed piecewise uniform mesh with a transition para-
meter σ due to Shishkin (note that this σ should not be confused with the ﬁtting
factor σ in the previous section). This piecewise uniform mesh is constructed by
ﬁrst specifying a σ in the interior of Ω and then constructing two uniform meshes
on each of the two resulting subintervals of Ω. Taking N to be an even number, each
of these uniform meshes has N
2 equal mesh intervals and their common point σ is
called the transition point between these two uniform meshes. If the point σ = 1
2, it
is clear that the complete mesh Ω
N = {ti}N
i=0 on T is a uniform mesh, but if σ ̸= 1
2,
say σ < 1
2, then the mesh in (0, σ] is ﬁner than the mesh in (σ, T ]. The explicit
deﬁnition of the Shishkin mesh Ω N
ε in this case is as follows.
First, the transition point is deﬁned by

Elementary Tutorial on Numerical Methods for Singular Perturbation Problems
13
σ = min(1
2, ε ln N)
(14)
and it is not hard to see that the mesh widths of the ﬁne and coarse uniform meshes
are
h = 2σ
N
and H = 2(1 −σ)
N
,
(15)
respectively. Then, the mesh points are given explicitly by
ti = ih, i = 0 : N
2 ,
(16)
ti = σ + (i −N
2 )H, i = N
2 + 1 : N.
(17)
Notice that the Shishkin mesh Ω N
ε depends on N and ε.
The main theoretical result we want to prove is contained in the following theorem,
which provides a parameter-uniform error estimate of essentially ﬁrst order, in the
sense that the ln N factor means that it is not strictly ﬁrst order. However, in practice,
the factor ln N is negligible.
Theorem 1.1 The numerical solutions U N
ε of (P N
ε ) and the exact solution uε of (Pε)
satisfy the following ε-uniform error estimate, for all N ≥4,
sup
0<ε≤1
|U N
ε −uε|Ω N
ε ≤C N −1 ln N,
(18)
where C is a constant independent of ε and N.
This will be proved in what follows by a sequence of lemmas.
First we deﬁne the reduced problem (P0) corresponding to (Pε) as
a(t)u0(t) = f (t).
(19)
This is obtained by putting ε = 0 in (Pε). Its solution is clearly
u0(t) = f (t)
a(t) .
We then deﬁne the Shishkin decomposition of uε. We write
uε = vε + wε,
where vε is the smooth component of the decomposition and is deﬁned to be the
solution of the problem
Lεvε = f, vε(0) = u0(0);

14
J.J.H. Miller
u0 being the solution of the reduced problem. It follows that the singular component
wε must be the solution of the problem
Lεwε = 0, wε(0) = uε(0) −vε(0).
This decomposition enables us to obtain sharper bounds than the classical bounds
given in Lemma 1.5.
Note that the equation for vε gives εv′
ε(0) + a(0)vε(0) = f (0) and the initial
condition for vε gives a(0)vε(0) = f (0). Combining these we obtain εv′
ε(0) = 0
and so v′
ε(0) = 0.
Note also that Lεv′
ε = εv′′
ε + av′
ε and, by differentiating the equation satisﬁed by
vε, we get εv′′
ε + (avε)′ = f ′. Eliminating v′′
ε gives Lεv′
ε = f ′ −a′v′.
The sharper bounds are contained in the following lemma.
Lemma 1.6 The components vε, wε of the exact solution uε satisfy the bounds
|vε|k ≤C, k = 0, 1 and |vε|2 ≤Cε−1,
|w(k)
ε (t)| ≤Cε−ke−αt
ε , k = 0, 1, 2 for all t ∈Ω.
Proof The bound on vε follows from the corresponding bound in Lemma 1.5, since
vε is the solution to a problem of the same form as (Pε).
The bound on v′
ε is obtained by considering the two functions φ±(t) = C(1 + | f ′|) ±
v′
ε(t). Then, φ±(0) = C(1 + | f ′|) ± v′
ε(0) ≥v′
ε(0) = 0. Furthermore, Lεφ±(t) =
a(t)C(1 + | f ′|) ± Lεv′
ε(t) ≥Cα(1 + | f ′|) ± ( f ′ −a′v′) ≥0. The required bound
on v′
ε follows from the bound on vε and the maximum principle Lemma 1.1. The
bound on v′′
ε is obtained from the equation εv′′
ε + (avε)′ = f ′ and the bounds on vε
and v′
ε.
The bound on wε is obtained similarly. We introduce the functions
ψ±(t) = Ce−αt
ε ± wε(t),
where C is a suitably large constant. Then
ψ±(0) = C ± wε(0) = C ± (uε(0) −vε(0)) ≥C −(|u0| + |v0(0)|) ≥0.
Also,
Lεψ±(t) = CLεe−αt
ε ± Lεwε(t) = CLεe−αt
ε = (a(t) −α)e−αt
ε > 0.
From the maximum principle we then have
ψ±(t) ≥0 for all t ∈Ω,
and so

15
|w(k)
ε (t)| ≤Cε−ke−αt
ε
for all t ∈Ω,
as required.
To bound the derivatives of wε we use the differential equation repeatedly. We have
w′
ε(t) = −ε−1a(t)wε(t)
and so
|w′
ε(t)| = |ε−1a(t)wε(t)| ≤Cε−1e−αt
ε .
Similarly
w′′
ε(t) = −ε−1(a(t)w′
ε(t) + a′(t)wε(t))
and so
|w′′
ε(t)| ≤Cε−2e−αt
ε ,
as required.
This completes the proof of this lemma.
The Shishkin decomposition of the discrete solution is analogous to that of the
exact solution. We have
U N
ε = V N
ε + W N
ε ,
where V N
ε is the smooth component of the decomposition and is deﬁned to be the
solution of the problem
L N
ε V N
ε = f, V N
ε (0) = vε(0).
It follows that the singular component W N
ε must be the solution of the problem
LεW N
ε = 0, W N
ε (0) = wε(0).
The error can now be decomposed into smooth and singular components as follows
U N
ε −uε = (V N
ε −vε) + (W N
ε −wε).
(20)
These are now bounded separately. We bound the smooth component ﬁrst. We have
L N
ε (V N
ε −vε) = f −L N
ε vε = (Lε −L N
ε )vε = ε( d
dt −D−)vε.
Hence, using (4), we have, for each ti ∈Ω N
ε ,
|L N
ε (V N
ε −vε)(ti)| = |ε( d
dt −D−)vε(ti)| ≤ε
2(ti −ti−1)|vε|2,[ti−1,ti].

16
J.J.H. Miller
Noting that, for a Shishkin mesh, ti −ti−1 ≤2N −1 and using the bound for |vε|2 in
the Lemma 1.6, we obtain
|L N
ε (V N
ε −vε)(ti)| ≤CεN −1ε−1 = C N −1.
From the stability of L N
ε it follows that
|(V N
ε −vε)(ti)| ≤C N −1, for all ti ∈Ω N
ε ,
which is
|V N
ε −vε|Ω N
ε ≤C N −1,
(21)
the required bound on the smooth component of the error.
For the singular component of the error we need to use the two different estimates
of the local truncation error. From (4) we obtain
|L N
ε (W N
ε −wε)(ti)| = |ε( d
dt −D−)wε(ti)| ≤ε
2(ti −ti−1)|wε|2,[ti−1,ti]
(22)
and similarly from (3)
|L N
ε (W N
ε −wε)(ti)| = |ε( d
dt −D−)wε(ti)| ≤2ε|wε|1,[ti−1,ti].
(23)
We consider the following two possibilities separately; either σ = 1
2 or σ = ε
α ln N.
In the ﬁrst case, since σ = min{ 1
2, ε
α ln N} = 1
2, we have
1
2 ≤ε
α ln N or ε−1 ≤
2
α ln N. Since, in this case, the mesh is uniform ti −ti−1 = N −1 and using the bound
for |wε|2,[ti−1,ti] in Lemma 1.4, we obtain
|L N
ε (W N
ε −wε)(ti)| ≤CεN −1ε−2e−
αti−1
ε
≤C N −1ε−1 ≤C N −1 ln N.
From the stability of L N
ε it follows that
|(W N
ε −wε)(ti)| ≤C N −1 ln N, for all ti ∈Ω N
ε ,
(24)
which is the required bound.
In the second case the argument depends on the location of the mesh point ti.
There are 3 possibilities:
• ti ∈(0, t N
2 ], in the ﬁne mesh;
• ti ∈(t N
2 +1, 1], in the coarse mesh;
• ti = t N
2 = σ, at the transition point.
and we recall that for all of these we are dealing with the case σ = ε
α ln N. We
consider each possibility in turn.

We begin with the ﬁne mesh. Since ti −ti−1 = 2σ
N = 2ε
α N −1 ln N, using the bound
for |wε|2,[ti−1,ti] in Lemma 1.4, we obtain from (22)
|L N

Then, using the estimate (23) of the local truncation error and the bound for

ε −wε)(ti)| ≤2ε|wε|1,[ti−1,ti] ≤Ce−

Computations
For the numerical solution of differential equations the following codes are useful and
widely available: MatLab, Octave and Python-Anaconda. The ﬁrst is a commercial
code with a reduced price for academics and a further reduced price for the student
edition. The second and third are open source and free.
In this section we consider another simple initial value problem. This involves the
following second order differential equation with constant coefﬁcients
m d2y
dt2 + k dy
dt + cy = 0,

18
J.J.H. Miller
which describes the damped vibrations of a point mass m on a spring with spring
constant c and damping coefﬁcient k. Here, m, k, c are taken to be positive constants.
The initial conditions are
y(0) = y0,
dy(0)
dt
= y1,
where the initial displacement y0 and the initial velocity y1 are given.
The exact solution is
y(t) = Aeλ+t + Beλ−t,
where A, B are integration constants and λ+, λ−are the roots of
mλ2 + kλ + c = 0, λ± = −k ±
√
k2 −4mc
2m
.
We assume, henceforth, that
k2 > 4mc,
which ensures that both of these roots are real and distinct.
The integration constants A, B are determined by the initial conditions as follows:
y(0) = 0 implies that A + B = 0 or B = −A
and
dy(0)
dt
= y1 implies that A(λ+ −λ−) = y1 or A =
y1
λ+ −λ−.
This example becomes a singularly perturbed problem if m is small. We write
m = ε,
0 < ε << 1.
where ε is a singular perturbation parameter multiplying the highest derivative term.
The equation is then
εd2y
dt2 + k dy
dt + cy = 0.
(29)
The appropriate initial conditions are now
y(0) = 0,
(30)
εdy(0)
dt
= γ,
(31)

Elementary Tutorial on Numerical Methods for Singular Perturbation Problems
19
where γ is independent of ε. These differ from the unperturbed case, because the
derivative in the second condition is now multiplied by ε. This is necessary here
because the ﬁrst derivative of the solution | dy
dt | is unbounded as ε →0, while |ε dy
dt |
is bounded. This is seen at once from the exact solution
y(t) =
γ
ε(λ+ −λ−)(eλ+t −eλ−t),
where λ± are the roots of
ελ2 + kλ + c.
We assume that k2 > 4εc to ensure that the roots are real and distinct.
The plot of the exact solution for the moderate value ε = 1
2 is given in Fig.1.
Let us investigate now what happens as ε →0. The plots of the exact solution for
ε = 1
4,
1
8,
1
16,
1
32 are given in Fig.2. As expected we see that as ε →0 the gradient
of the solution becomes increasingly steep in a neighbourhood of t = 0, so we have
a layer there. Even for the moderately small value
1
32, the exact solution near the
origin is graphically indistinguishable from the vertical axis.
We now use numerical methods to solve problems with layers. We shall discover
that standard ﬁnite difference methods are not reliable for this task. The same can
be shown to be true for standard ﬁnite element methods. By this we mean that they
must be used with caution and particular attention must be paid to the relative sizes
of the singular perturbation parameter and the mesh parameters.
The ﬁnite difference method with centered operator for the above problem is
εδ2Ui + kD0Ui + cUi = 0,
U0 = 0,
εD+U0 = γ,
where the mesh is uniform with mesh spacing h = 1
N and N is the number of mesh
subintervals in a unit interval on the t-axis.
We look for a numerical solution for t ∈[0, T ], where, to be speciﬁc, we take T = 3.
Plots of the numerical solution for ε = 1
8, N = 16 and the corresponding exact
solution are given in Fig.3. The exact solution is plotted as a continuous line, while
the values of the numerical solution are denoted by a small circle at each mesh point.
It is easy to see that the numerical solution is highly inaccurate.

8, N = 16
Can this situation be improved and, if so, how? What about a ﬁner mesh? Can you
predict what will happen? We take N = 256 and plot the results in Fig.4. These
results are a big improvement. But are they robust in the sense that they are just as
good for other values of the parameter? So far, ε has had moderate values. Let us try
taking the smaller value ε =
1
1000. The results are plotted in Fig.5. We see that the
numerical solution is again highly inaccurate outside the boundary layer. Moreover,
in a neighbourhood of the boundary layer at t = 0 it displays enormous spurious
oscillations unrelated to the exact solution. In fact here, the numerical solution is
completely different from the exact solution. This is seen more clearly when we
restrict the plot of the solution to a neighbourhood of the boundary layer as in Fig.6.
Can we do anything to overcome these problems? The obvious thing to try is to
reﬁne the mesh as before. We therefore take N = 1024 and plot the results in Fig.7.
We see there that the spurious oscillations in the neighbourhood of the boundary
layer have been eliminated, but there remain large errors in the rest of the domain.

Our overall conclusion is that the ﬁnite difference method with centered operator
on a uniform mesh is unreliable for this problem, even for moderate values of ε. We
canalsosaythat this examplehas illustratedthefact that numerical experimentationis
an extremely useful tool for distinguishing between good and bad numerical methods.
We now try a different numerical method, namely, the following upwind method

ε = 1
8, N = 256
εδ2Ui + kD+Ui + cUi = 0,
U0 = 0,
εD+U0 = γ.
Here the ﬁrst order derivative is replaced by a one-sided ﬁnite difference quotient
and the method is said to be upwinded. The mesh is uniform with N equally spaced
mesh subintervals. The results of applying this method for ε = 1
8 and N = 256 are
shown in Fig.8. The solution is satisfactory, although not quite as accurate as the
solution given by the previous method with the centered difference operator.
Let us now look at the behaviour for smaller ε =
1
1000, keeping the same uniform
mesh with N = 256. The results are shown in Fig.9. Again the errors have become
enormous, when ε is reduced. The one positive thing about this method is that the
numerical solution shows no sign of spurious oscillations, as was the case for the
method with the centered operator. Our overall conclusion is that the ﬁnite difference
method with an upwind operator on a uniform mesh is again unreliable for this
problem.
It has become apparent that we need a method that produces numerical solutions
with an accuracy that is not destroyed when ε becomes small. To achieve this we use
a parameter-uniform numerical method. For the singularly perturbed initial value
problem (29), (30), (31) it can be shown theoretically that a parameter-uniform
method is obtained by using the upwind ﬁnite difference operator described above
together with the Shishkin mesh that was constructed in the previous section.

The numerical results obtained by applying this parameter-uniform method are plot-
ted in Fig.10. We see that the agreement with the exact solution is excellent for this
small value of ε. The use of the Shishkin mesh has eliminated the large errors of the
methods based on the centered or upwind operators on uniform meshes.
It remains to see whether further reduction of ε destroys the numerical solution
or not. We take ε = 10−6, much smaller than any previous choice. We see in Fig.11
that the numerical results with this method are brilliant; just as good as for ε =
1
1000
and without the need for any ﬁner mesh than was used in the previous case!
In this section we have shown experimentally that standard ﬁnite difference meth-
ods, applied on uniform meshes, are not reliable for solving singularly perturbed
differential equations, when the singular perturbation parameter becomes small. To
overcome this problem it may be possible to increase the number of mesh subin-
tervals so that N is of order 1
ε. This brute force approach can be used for simple
problems, but for very large systems of equations and very small values of the singu-
lar perturbation parameters this may not be feasible. In such cases the use of suitable
generalisations (for example in the books [1–5]) of the parameter-uniform methods
described in this tutorial may offer an elegant and reliable option.

Interior Layers in Singularly Perturbed
Problems
Eugene O’Riordan
Abstract To construct layer adapted meshes for a class of singularly perturbed
problems, whose solutions contain boundary layers, it is necessary to identify both
the location and the width of any boundary layers present in the solution. Additional
interior layers can appear when the data for the problem is not sufﬁciently smooth.In
the context of singularly perturbed partial differential equations, the presence of any
interior layer typically requires the introduction of a transformation of the problem,
which facilitates the necessary alignment of the mesh to the trajectory of the interior
layer. Here we review a selection of published results on such problems to illustrate
the variety of ways that interior layers can appear.

Introduction
The analytical solutions of linear singularly perturbed differential equations typically
contain boundary layers. To construct parameter-uniform numerical methods [1] for
such problems, the location, width and strength of all layers present in the solution
needs to be identiﬁed. In addition to boundary layers, interior layers can also appear
in certain types of singularly perturbed problems. Interior layers can form for several
reasons. For example, interior layers can appear due to the presence of turning points,
non-smooth coefﬁcients, non-smooth boundary/initial data, non-linearities or lack of
compatibility at any corner points within the domain. In the case of linear problems,
the strength and width of any interior layer will depend on whether the problem is of
convection-diffusion or reaction-diffusion type on either side of the layer. If turning
points are present (when the convective coefﬁcient is continuous and passes through
zero at some point within the domain) then the nature of any boundary or interior

layer will depend on the rate at which the convective coefﬁcient approaches its root.
The level of smoothness of the problem data will also inﬂuence the creation of interior
layers. In the case of singularly perturbed parabolic problems, the location of any
interior layer may move with time and any layer-adaptive mesh will be required to
track this movement. In the case of nonlinear problems, the location of any interior
layer may not be known explicitly and detailed asymptotic information about the
location of the interior layer will be required in order to construct a suitable mesh
for the problem. In this paper, we review some recent results on singularly perturbed
problems with interior layers.
In Sect.2, we begin with some standard results on linear singularly perturbed prob-
lems with smooth data, where we identify sufﬁcient regularity for the data so that no
internal layer appears in the solution and the standard results on parameter-uniform
numerical methods for both convection-diffusion and reaction-diffusion problems
immediately apply. In Sect.3, we introduce a discontinuity into a simple initial value
problem and give the modiﬁcations in both the mesh and the analysis that are required
to retain the basic result of ﬁrst order parameter-uniform convergence. In Sect.4, we
discuss some results concerning interior layers appearing in linear ordinary differ-
ential equations due to discontinuities in the data. In Sect.5 we brieﬂy consider a
particular type of singularly perturbed turning point problem with interior layers of
exponential-type in the solution. In Sect.6, we outline the issues around capturing a
moving interior layer and in Sect.7 we conclude the paper with some comments on
interior layers occurring in nonlinear singularly perturbed problems.
Notation. Here and throughout the paper, C is a generic constant independent of both
the singular perturbation parameter ε and N, which is the number of mesh elements
used in any co-ordinate direction. Also, ∥· ∥D denotes the maximum pointwise norm
over the set D.

Linear Singularly Perturbed Problems with Smooth Data
Linear second order singularly perturbed boundary value problems can be catego-
rized into two broad problem classes: problems of reaction-diffusion or convection-
diffusion type.
Consider the following class of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems
of the form: Find u ∈Ck+2( ¯Ω), k ≥0 such that
Lε,(1)u := −εu′′ + b(x)u = f (x),
x ∈Ω := (0, 1),
(1a)
u(0) = u0, u(1) = u1;
b, f ∈Ck(Ω);
b(x) ≥β > 0, x ∈Ω.
(1b)
Due to the assumption b(x) > 0, the differential operator is inverse-monotone. That
is: For any function y ∈C0( ¯Ω) ∩C2(Ω) if y(0) ≥0, y(1) ≥0 and Lε,(1)y(x) ≥
0, x ∈Ω then y(x) ≥0, ∀x ∈¯Ω. This property of the differential operator is used

extensively to obtain suitable bounds on various components of the solution and in
estimating the level of accuracy of any proposed approximation to the solution.
The associated reduced problem is simply b(x)v0(x) = f (x). Note that the
reduced solution v0 of any singularly perturbed problem is deﬁned in such a way that
∥u −v0∥Ω0 ≤Cεp,
meas(Ω \ Ω0) = O(εp ln(1/ε)),
p > 0
and that v0 solves the associated differential equation with ε formally set to zero. In
general, the reduced solution will not satisfy all the boundary conditions and, then,
boundary layers form when there is a discrepancy between the boundary values of the
reduced solution and the solution. To correct this discrepancy, we deﬁne the leading
term of the two boundary layer functions for problem (1) to be
wL,0(x) := (u(0) −v0(0))e−√b(0)
ε x,
wR,0(x) := (u(1) −v0(1))e−√b(1)
ε (1−x).
Then we observe that Lε,(1)(v0 + wL,0 + wR,0) = O(√ε) as
∥Lε,(1)v0∥¯Ω ≤Cε and |Lε,(1)wL,0(x)| ≤Cxe−√b(0)
ε x ≤C√ε;
and (v0 + wL,0 + wR,0)(0)=Ce−√b(1)
ε , (v0 + wL,0 + wR,0)(1) = Ce−√b(0)
ε . Hence,
we have constructed the following asymptotic expansion
uasy = v0 + wL,0 + wR,0,
where ∥u −uasy∥¯Ω ≤C√ε.
From this bound, we see that f (x)/b(x) is indeed the reduced solution for the
reaction-diffusion problem.
If we impose the constraint ε ≤C N −2p, p > 0, then without performing any
numerical calculations the above asymptotic expansion of v0 + wL,0 + wR,0, yields
an O(N −p)-approximate solution to the solution u with relatively low regularity
assumed (i.e., let k = 2 in (1)). However, we wish to generate approximations with-
out imposing a constraint of the form ε ≤C N −2p on the set of problems being con-
sidered. Our interest lies in designing parameter-uniform numerical methods [1] for
a large set of singularly perturbed problems. Parameter-uniform numerical methods
guarantee convergence of the numerical approximations, without imposing a mesh-
dependent restriction on the permissible size of the singular perturbation parameter.
To establish parameter-uniform asymptotic error bounds on any numerical approx-
imations generated, we will require bounds on the derivatives of the components.
The above asymptotic expansion does not yield information about the derivatives of
the solution.
In place of the asymptotic expansion, we will utilize a Shishkin decomposi-
tion [2] of the solution in the analysis of appropriate numerical methods for (1).

Then the regular component v ∈Ck( ¯Ω) satisﬁes the boundary value problem
Lε,(1)v = f,
v(0) = v∗(0), v(1) = v∗(1).
If v(0) ̸= u(0), then a boundary layer will be present in a neighbourhood of x = 0.

of the following homogeneous problems
Lε,(1)wL = 0, wL(0) = u(0) −v(0), wL(1) = 0;
Lε,(1)wR = 0, wR(0) = 0, wR(1) = u(1) −v(1).
Note that wL(x) ̸= wL,0(x). The Shishkin decomposition (with no remainder term)
is now of the form
u = v + wL + wR.
If b, f ∈C4(Ω) then one can establish [3, Chap.6] the following bounds on the
derivatives of the components of the solution of (1).
∥v(i)∥¯Ω ≤C(1 + ε1−i/2),
i ≤4;
|w(i)
L (x)| ≤Cε−i/2e−√β
ε x,
|w(i)
R (x)| ≤Cε−i/2e−√β
ε (1−x),
i ≤4.
where v(i) denotes the ith-derivative of v. Thus the solution of (1) has boundary
layers of width O(√ε log ε) near the end-points x = 0 and x = 1. Once the location
and width of all the layers have been identiﬁed (as above) then a layer-adapted mesh
can be constructed for the problem.
In the case of convection-diffusion problems of the form: Find u ∈Ck+2( ¯Ω),
k ≥0 such that
Lε,(2)u := −εu′′ + a(x)u′ + b(x)u = f (x), x ∈Ω,
(2a)
u(0) = u0, u(1) = u1;
a, b, f ∈Ck(Ω),
a(x) ≥α > 0, b(x) ≥0.
(2b)
The reduced solution satisﬁes the ﬁrst order problem: Find v0 ∈Ck+1( ¯Ω) such that
L0,(2)v0 := a(x)v′
0 + b(x)v0 = f (x), x ∈Ω,
v0(0) = u(0).
Deﬁne the extended domain Ω∗:= (0, L), L > 1 and a∗, b∗, f ∗∈Ck(Ω∗). The

Then L∗
ε,(2)v∗= f ∗and Lε,(2)v = f, v(0) = u(0),
v(1) = v∗(1). If a, b, f ∈
Ck(Ω), then v ∈Ck( ¯Ω). The boundary layer component satisﬁes the homogeneous
problem
Lε,(2)w = 0,
w(0) = 0, w(1) = u(1) −v(1).
Hence u = v + w and if a, b, f ∈C3(Ω) then [1, Chap.3]
∥v(i)∥¯Ω ≤C(1 + ε2−i);
|w(i)(x)| ≤Cε−ie−α(1−x)/ε,
i ≤3.
Using simple stable ﬁnite difference scheme with a standard piecewise-uniform
Shishkin mesh to produce a numerical approximationU N, one has for the convection-
diffusion problem (2) (see, for example, [1, Chap.3]): If a, b, f ∈C3(Ω) then
∥u −¯U N∥Ω ≤C N −1(ln N)
and for the reaction-diffusion problem (1) (see, for example, [3, Chap.6]): If b, f ∈
C4(Ω) then
∥u −¯U N∥Ω ≤C N −2(ln N)2,
where ¯U N is the piecewise linear interpolant of the mesh function U N. Note that,
as one would expect, higher regularity is required of the data to establish higher
order convergence. The regularity required of the data is dictated by the chosen con-
struction of the solution decomposition. An alternative construction of the solution
decomposition can allow one relax the constraints (imposed above) on the data [4].
If there is no modiﬁcation to the standard numerical method on a layer-adapted
mesh, then the above stated orders of parameter-uniform convergence can reduce for
less smooth data [2, Sect. 14.2], [5]. If the data is discontinuous, then the standard
numerical method will fail to be parameter-uniformly convergent [6, Table4].

Singularly Perturbed Initial Value Problems
with Discontinuous Data
Notation: Throughout the paper we adopt the following notation for the jump in a
function at an internal point:
[ f (d)] := f (d+) −f (d−), 0 < d < 1;
and we deﬁne the punctured domain by Ωd := (0, 1) \ {d}.
To illustrate the effect of discontinuous data, we begin our discussion with a simple
initial value problem of the form: Find u ∈C0( ¯Ω) ∩Ck+1(Ωd) such that
εu′ + a(x)u = f (x), a(x) ≥α > 0,
x ∈Ωd,
(3a)
u(0) = u0,
a, f ∈Ck(Ωd),
k ≥0.

Observe that the differential equation is not applied at the single interior point x = d,
Instead, the value of the solution at x = d is determined by requiring that the solution
becontinuousatthisinternalpoint.Inaddition,sincea(x) ≥α > 0, x ∈Ωd,wehave
the following useful monotonicity property of the ﬁrst order differential operator
associated with problem (3):
For any function g ∈C1(Ωd) ∩C0( ¯Ω), then if g(0) ≥0 and (εg′ + ag)(x) ≥0
for all x ∈Ωd then g(x) ≥0, x ∈¯Ω.
The solution can be decomposed into a sum u = v + w + z, composed of a dis-
continuous regular component v, a continuous initial layer component w and a dis-
continuous interior layer component z. The components are deﬁned as the solutions
of the problems:
εv′ + a(x)v = f (x), x ∈Ωd,
a(0)v(0) = f (0),
a(d+)v(d+) = f (d+);
εw′ + a(x)w = 0, x ∈Ωd,
w(0) = u(0) −v(0),
w(d+) = w(d−);
εz′ + a(x)z = 0, x ∈Ωd,
z(0) = 0,
[z(d)] = −[v(d)].
Using the above monotonicity property of the differential operator, one can easily
deduce the following bounds on these components: If a, f ∈C1(Ωd) then
∥v(i)∥Ωd ≤C(1 + ε1−i),
i = 0, 1, 2;
(4a)
|w(x)| ≤Ce−αx/ε,
|w(i)(x)|Ωd ≤Cε−ie−αx/ε,
i = 1, 2;
(4b)
z(x) ≡0,
x < d,
|z(x)| ≤Ce−α(d−x)/ε,
x ∈(d, 1);
(4c)
|z(i)(x)|(d,1) ≤Cε−ie−α(d−x)/ε,
i = 1, 2.
(4d)
From these bounds we see that the solution has an initial boundary layer w in the
vicinity of x = 0 and an interior layer to the right of x = d.
Given this a priori information, an appropriate distribution of the mesh points
{xi}N
i=0 is as follows: The end-points of the domain are included as x0 = 0, xN = 1
and the internal point d, where the data is discontinuous, is taken to be the mesh
point xN/2. The remaining internal mesh points ωN = {xi}N/2−1
i=1
∪{xi}N−1
i=N/2+1 are
distributed so as to capture the two scales present in the solution. The domain is split
into four sub-intervals [0, 1] = [0, σ1] ∪[σ1, d] ∪[d, d + σ2] ∪[d + σ2, 1], where
the Shishkin transition parameters [3] are taken to be
σ1 := min

, σ2 := min

.
The mesh elements are distributed equally across these sub-intervals. An appropriate
numerical method for this problem is: Find a mesh function U such that:
εD−U N(xi) + a(x−
i )U N(xi) = f (x−
i ),
xi ∈ωN ∪{d},
U N(0) = u(0),
where D−is the standard backward ﬁnite difference operator. The discrete solution
U may be decomposed into the sum U = V + W + Z, where the boundary layer

component w is approximated by the solution W of the homogeneous problem
εD−W(xi) + a(x−
i )W(xi) = 0,
xi ∈ωN ∪{d},
W(0) = u(0) −v(0).
The discrete regular component V and discrete interior layer component Z are multi-
valued (at x = d) functions and are deﬁned to be
V :=
 V −, xi ∈[0, d]
V +, xi ∈[d, 1] ,
Z :=
 0,
xi ∈[0, d]
Z+, xi ∈[d, 1] ,
where
εD−V −(xi) + a(x−
i )V −(xi) = f (x−
i ), xi ∈(0, d],
V −(0) = v(0);
εD−V +(xi) + a(xi)V +(xi) = f (xi), xi ∈(d, 1],
V +(d) = v(d+);
εD−Z+(xi) + a(xi)Z+(xi) = 0, xi ∈(d, 1],
Z+(d) = −[V ](d).
Based on classical stability, truncation error analysis and the parameter-explicit
bounds on the derivatives of w given in (4b), we conclude that in the initial layer
region [0, σ1]
|W(xi) −w(xi)|[0,σ1] ≤C N −1 ln N.
Then we note that, for xi ∈[σ1, 1], the error in the layer component is
|W(xi) −w(xi)|[σ1,1] ≤|W(xi)| + |w(xi)|
≤|Wε(σ1)| + C N −1 ≤C N −1,
if
2σ1 < d.
Using the bounds (4a) on the regular component we also conclude that
|V (xi) −v(xi)| ≤C N −1,
xi ∈Ωd,
|V −(d) −v(d−)| ≤C N −1.
Note that Z+(d) = −[v(d)] + V −(d) −v(d−) and by examining the error |Z −z|
on (d, d + σ2] and (d + σ2, 1] separately we conclude that
|Z(xi) −z(xi)|[d,1] ≤C N −1 ln N,
if
2σ2 < 1 −d.
If 2σ1 = d or 2σ2 = 1 −d then a standard stability and consistency argument yields
max
i
|U N(xi) −u(xi)| ≤C N −1 ln N.
Hence, using linear interpolation (e.g., see [1, Theorem 3.12]), we conclude that
∥¯U N −u∥Ω ≤C N −1 ln N,
where ¯U N is again the piecewise linear interpolant of the mesh function U N.

Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems
with Non-smooth Data
Let us now consider a reaction-diffusion two point boundary value problem with a
diffusion coefﬁcient of a constant scale O(ε) and a lack of smoothness in the data at
some internal point. Find u ∈C1( ¯Ω) ∩Ck(Ωd) such that
−εu′′ + b(x)u = f (x), b(x) ≥β > 0, x ∈Ωd, u(0), u(1)given; b, f ∈Ck(Ωd).
The associated reduced problem is b(x)v0(x) = f (x), x ̸= d and so if [( f/b)(d)] ̸=
0, then the reduced solution will be discontinuous at the internal point d. Hence, the
solution will contain an internal layer function, which will exhibit layers of width
O(√ε ln ε) on either side of the interface point x = d. Note that by requiring that
u ∈C1( ¯Ω) we are imposing the constraints [u](d) = [u′](d) = 0 on the solution.
We generalize this problem to a reaction-diffusion problem with a variable diffu-
sion coefﬁcient having potentially different scales either side of a point of disconti-
nuity x = d in the data. Find u ∈C0( ¯Ω) ∩C4(Ωd) such that
Lε,(3)u := −(ε(x)u′)′ + r(x)uε = f, x ∈Ωd;
u(0), u(1) given;

(5c)
p,r, f ∈C4(Ωd),
r(x) ≥r0 > 0, r(x)
p(x) > β > 0,
x ∈Ωd.
(5d)
In particular, Eqs.(5c) and (5b) above indicate that all the coefﬁcients in (5a) may
exhibit a jump at x = d and also they allow for a scaled jump in the ﬂux (−εu′
ε)
at x = d. The regular component v and singular component w of the solution are
deﬁned, respectively, as the solutions of the discontinuous problems
Lε,(3)v = f,
Lε,(3)w = 0,
x ∈Ωd;
r(x)v(x) = f (x), x ∈{0, d−, d+, 1};
[w(d)] = −[v(d)],
[εw′(d)] = −[εv′(d)] −Q′
1,
w(0) = u(0) −v(0), w(1) = u(1) −v(1).
Note that, in general, v, w /∈C0(Ω) even though their sum u = v + w is continuous.

Based on these bounds, an appropriate piecewise-uniform Shishkin mesh can be
constructed. However, to retain parameter-uniform second order convergence for
this reaction-diffusion problem, it is necessary to employ a particular discretization
of the jump conditions at the mesh point xi = d. See [7] for details.
Boundary and interior layers can be classiﬁed as either weak or strong layers. A
layer is a strong layer near a point x = p if u′(p−) or u′(p+) is unbounded as ε →0.
A layer is a weak layer near x = p, if the ﬁrst derivatives u′(p−) and u′(p+) are
bounded, but either u′′(p−) or u′′(p+) is unbounded as ε →0. In all of the above
problems, only strong interior layers appeared. When a convective term is included in
the differential equation, weak interior layers can appear in the solutions. Note that,
if one employs a classical ﬁnite difference operator (such as simple upwinding), then
it is essential that one employs a suitable layer-adapted mesh to capture any strong
internal layers present in the solution. The adverse effect of using a uniform mesh
for a weak layer are minimal. Nevertheless, one still observes some improvement in
the numerical results if one also uses a layer-adapted mesh in the vicinity of a weak
layer. We refer to the numerical results in [8] to justify this comment.
We now look at ﬁve particular singularly perturbed problems, with a convective
term present in the differential equation. These particular problems illustrate the
variety of layers that can occur when the problem has discontinuous data. For all ﬁve
problems, we seek to ﬁnd u ∈C1( ¯Ω), with u(0) = u(1) = 0 and

−εu′′ −u′ = 1, x < 0.5;
−εu′′ + u′ = −1, x > 0.5.
(6e)
For the ﬁrst four problems, we can deﬁne the following associated reduced problems
v′
0 = 1, x < 0.5, v0(0) = u(0);
v′
0 = 1, x > 0.5, v0(1) = u(1);
v′
0 = 1, x < 0.5, v0(0) = u(0);
v0 = 1, x > 0.5;
v′
0 = 1, x < 0.5, v0(0) = u(0);
2v′
0 = −1, x > 0.5, [v0(0.5)] = 0;
v′
0 = 1, x < 0.5, v0(0) = u(0);
v0 = −1, x > 0.5, [v0(0.5)] = 0.
In the case of the ﬁrst two problems (6a, 6b), the reduced solution is discontinuous
and a strong interior layer forms in a neighbourhood of x = 0.5. In the next two
problem classes (6c, 6d), the reduced solution is continuous and a weak layer forms
in a neighbourhood of x = 0.5. There is no reduced problem for the ﬁfth problem (6e)

E. O’Riordan
as the solution is of order O(εe
1
2ε ) throughout the domain, except in O(ε ln(1/ε))-
neighbourhoods of the two end points.
For the ﬁrst four sample problems (6a–6d), associated problem classes can be
formulated and parameter-uniform numerical methods (based on standard ﬁnite dif-
ference schemes combined with appropriately ﬁtted piecewise uniform Shishkin)
were constructed in [9]. In the case of problems of the form (6e) a modiﬁcation
of the transmission condition from [u′(d)] = 0 to [(−εu′ + γu)(d)] = 0 (where γ
sufﬁciently large) allows one design a parameter-uniform numerical method for this
modiﬁed class of problems [10].
Further effects can be built into such problem classes, such as point sources (i.e.
δ-functions) or multi-parameter problems with variable diffusion. In [11], high order
parameter-uniform methods were constructed for the following two problem classes:
Find u ∈C4(Ωd) ∩C0( ¯Ω), u(0) = u0, u(1) = u1, such that
−(ε(x)u′)′ + a(x)u′ + b(x)u = f (x), x ̸= d,

−(εu′)(d)

= Q1;
(7)
−(ε(x)u′ + a(x)u)′ + b(x)u = f (x), x ̸= d,

(−εu′ + au)(d)

= Q2;
(8)
and for both problem classes we assume that
ε, a, b, f ∈C4(Ωd);
b(x) ≥0,
ε(x) > 0, |a(x)| > 0, x ̸= d.
The nature of the interior layers appearing in (7) and (8) can have different character.
If Q1 = 0 in (7), then the strength of the interior layer depends on the sign of a(x)
and on the change in the ratio of convection to diffusion at d. A strong interior layer
can appear in (7) when a(x) > 0, x ̸= d and
ε(d−)
a(d−) << ε(d+)
a(d+).
If Q2 = 0 then a strong interior layer always appears near d in (8).
Numerous different types of interior layers can appear in problem classes (5), (7)
and (8), which is an indication of the rich variety of layers one can expect to occur
in higher dimensional versions of these one dimensional problem classes.

Singularly Perturbed Turning Point Problems
Singularly perturbed differential equations with discontinuous coefﬁcients can be
viewed as approximate models for singularly perturbed nonlinear problems. For
example, in the case of the quasilinear second order problem
−εu′′ + uu′ + u = 0,
x ∈Ω;
(9a)
u(0) = A > 1,
u(1) = B < −1;
(9b)

Interior Layers in Singularly Perturbed Problems
35
then an interior layer (with a proﬁle of hyperbolic-tangent type) will appear [12, 13]
in the vicinity of some internal point 0 < dε < 1, where u(dε) = 0 and d0 :=
limε→0 dε. The associated reduced problem to this nonlinear problem is the non-
linear ﬁrst order problem
u0u′
0 + u0 = 0, u0(0) = A, 0 < x < d0;
u0u′
0 + u0 = 0, u0(1) = B, 1 > x > d0;
which has the discontinuous solution
u0(x) = A −x,
0 ≤x < d0;
u0(x) = B + 1 −x,
d0 < x ≤1.
For ε << 1, it is natural to consider the following approximate problem for the above
nonlinear problem (9). Find y ∈C1(Ω) such that
−εy′′ + u0y′ + y = 0,
x ∈Ωd,
y(0) = u(0), y(1) = u(1).
This linearized approximate problem is within the class of problems discussed in
Sect.3, for which parameter-uniform numerical methods have been developed in
the literature [9]. However, the convective coefﬁcient in the nonlinear problem is
continuous and not discontinuous as in the above linearization of (9).
An alternative linearization of the nonlinear problem (9) would be the following
class of turning point problems with a continuous convective coefﬁcient: Find u ∈
C3(Ω) such that
(−εu′′ + aεu′ + bu)(x) = f (x),
x ∈Ω;
u(0) > 0, u(1) < 0; (10a)
aε ∈C2(Ω), aε(x) > 0, x ∈[0, d),
aε(d) = 0,
aε(x) < 0, x ∈(d, 1]. (10b)
Observe that the convective coefﬁcient is continuous, but depends on the singular
perturbation parameter. We also assume that the convective coefﬁcient aε(x) contains
it’s own interior layer. Deﬁne the limiting functions
a−
0 (x) := lim
ε→0 aε(x), x ∈[0, d) and a+
0 (x) := lim
ε→0 aε(x), x ∈(d, 1].
Assume that
|aε(x)| > |θ tanh (r(d −x)/ε)|,
θ > 2r > 0,
(10c)
|(a±
0 −aε)(x)| ≤Ce± θ
2ε (d−x),
x ∈Ωd.
(10d)
Then the solution of the above problem (10) will have an interior layer (with
a proﬁle of hyperbolic-tangent type) in an O(ε)-neighbourhood of the point d,
where the convective coefﬁcient has an interior layer. Based on this information,
a parameter-uniform numerical method was constructed [14] and shown to be
parameter-uniformly convergent of ﬁrst order.

36
E. O’Riordan
The nature of the interior layers appearing in problem (10) is different to the layers
appearing in the solutions of singularly perturbed turning point problems of the form
−εu′′ + a(x)u′ + b(x)u = f (x),
x ∈Ω;
a ∈C2(Ω), a(d) = 0, d ∈Ω, b > 0;
where the convective coefﬁcient a is independent of the singular perturbation para-
meter. Depending on the quantity b(d)/a′(d), there may be no interior layer or there
may be layers of power-law type present at d. See [15, 16] for a discussion of these
types of turning point problems.

Singularly Perturbed Parabolic Problems
Consider the following singularly perturbed parabolic problem: Find u ∈C1+γ(G),
G := (0, 1) × (0, 1] such that
−εuss + a1us + b1u + c1ut = f, (s, t) ∈G \ Γ,
Γ := {(s, t)|s = d(t), 0 < d(t) < 1};
u = g, (s, t) ∈¯G \ G;
b(s, t) ≥0, c(s, t) ≥γ > 0.
As in the previous sections, interior layers can appear in the solution due to discon-
tinuous coefﬁcients a, b, c and/or f [17]. Nine subclasses can be identiﬁed (see [9]
and [10]), which can exhibit strong or weak interior layers in the vicinity of the curve
Γ . Note that in these references, the interior layer location is known and the center of
the interior layer can move with time. By using a transformation T : (s, t) →(x, t)
so that T : Γ →{x = d(0)} any internal layer will be located along the vertical line
x = d in the computational domain (x, t) [18]. A computed solution is generated on
this transformed domain so that the piecewise-uniform mesh is aligned to the curve
Γ . Shishkin [19] established that it is necessary to align the grid to the interior layer
if one is seeking to construct a parameter-uniform numerical method.
Moreover, for parabolic problems interior layers can also appear when the bound-
ary/initial conditions are not smooth [20, 21]. If there is a discontinuity in the initial
condition u(s, 0) then a standard ﬁnite difference operator on a piecewise uniform
mesh will not sufﬁce to generate a parameter-uniform numerical method. A special
ﬁtted ﬁnite difference operator is required [22]. A regularization of a discontinuous
initial condition is possible by replacing the initial condition with an initial condition
of the form
u(s, 0) = A tanh
s −d0
√ε

+ B.
In this case, assuming the convective coefﬁcient is independent of space, the initial
interior layer is transported along the curve {(d(t), t) : d′(t) = a(t), d(0) = d0}; and

a parameter-uniform numerical method based on classical ﬁnite difference operator,
a suitable transformation and an appropriate piecewise-uniform mesh can be con-
structed [23, 24].

Singularly Perturbed Nonlinear Problems
with Interior Layers
Semilinear singularly perturbed differential equations of the form
−εu′′ + g(x, u) = 0,
x ∈Ω,
u(0) = A, u(1) = B;
(11a)
are typically constrained by a condition of the form
gu(x, u) ≥β > 0,
(x, u) ∈¯Ω × [−M, M];
(11b)
where M is a sufﬁciently large number that needs to be be explicitly identiﬁed. This
constraint is a restriction on the admissible type of nonlinear problem being studied.
Note that requiring
gu(x, u) ≥β > 0,
(x, u) ∈¯Ω × (−∞, ∞),
is a signiﬁcantly stronger restriction to impose on the problem class. This stronger
constraint guarantees a unique solution to the reduced problem and thereby regu-
lates the problem class to a minor extension from the corresponding class of linear
problems of reaction-diffusion type
−εu′′ + b(x)u = f (x),
b(x) ≥β > 0.
Interesting new phenomena can be observed when the nonlinear reduced problem
g(x, v) = 0 has non-unique solutions. The reduced solutions are classiﬁed as stable
reduced solutions if gu(x, v(x)) > 0, ∀x ∈¯Ω and as unstable reduced solutions if
gu(x, v(x)) < 0, ∀x ∈¯Ω.
Interior layers can appear in nonlinear problems. Typically, restrictions need to be
placed on the data so that solutions to the reduced problem exist and for the solution
of the singularly perturbed problem to exist and be unique. For example, in the case
of the semilinear reaction-diffusion problem: Find u ∈C1( ¯Ω) ∩C3(Ωd) such that
−εu′′ + (1 −u2)u = f (x), x ∈Ωd;
d = 0.5;
u(0) = A, u(1) = B;
f (x) > 0, x < d, f (x) < 0, x > d; [ f ](d) ̸= 0;

we impose the following limits on the input data
|A|, |B| <

√
3
,
∥f ∥<

.
This problem is formulated so that a discontinuous stable reduced solution lies
between two discontinuous unstable reduced solutions. Interior layers can appear in
the solution of this problem and the location of the layer will be positioned around the
point d, where the discontinuity in the data is located. By placing further restrictions
on the data, a parameter-uniform method was constructed in [25] for this semilinear
problem.
However, other semilinear problems of the form (11) can be very difﬁcult to solve
numerically. In [26] a semilinear problem of the form (11) with smooth data, where an
unstable continuous reduced solution was positioned between two stable continuous
reduced solutions, was examined. Using a piecewise-uniform Shishkin mesh (of an
appropriate width) centered at any point in the domain Ω, then an interior layer
forms within the ﬁne mesh, no matter where the mesh is centered [26]. Only in the
exceptional case where the ﬁne mesh is located in an O(√ε) neighbourhood of the
actual location of the interior layer will the numerical approximation be of any true
value.
Parameter-uniform numerical methods (based on piecewise-uniform Shishkin
meshes) have also been constructed [27] for quasilinear problems with interior layers
of the form: Find u ∈C1( ¯Ω) ∩C3(Ωd) such that
εu′′(x) + b(x, u)u′(x) = f (x), x ∈Ωd,
u(0) = A,
u(1) = B,
(12a)
b(x, u) =
 b1(u) = −1 + cu,
x < d
b2(u) = 1 + cu,
x > d
,
f (x) =
 −δ1 < 0,
x < d
δ2 > 0,
x > d
(12b)
−1 < u(0) < 0,
0 < u(1) < 1,
0 < c ≤1.
(12c)
As in the case of the semilinear problem, additional constraints need to be imposed
on the data {A, B, ∥f ∥, c} in order for the theoretical convergence result given in [27]
to apply. The numerical results in [28] suggest that the numerical approximations
generated by the method described in [27] converge for a wider class of problems
to that covered by the theoretical convergence analysis in [27]. Note, again, that for
this problem (12) the location of the interior layer is known to be positioned at d,
where both the convective coefﬁcient b(x, u) and the forcing term f are formulated
to be discontinuous.

Abstract The main objective of my talk is to discuss some numerical methods for
singularly perturbed delay differential equations. First some well-known mathemat-
ical models represented by differential equations with out delay and with delay are
presented. Then some basic numerical methods for delay differential equations are
brieﬂy described. After this an introduction to singularly perturbed delay problems
is given. Finally some numerical methods for these problems are discussed.

Introduction
As mentioned in the abstract ﬁrst I will present some well known mathematical
models represented by differential equations. Let P(t) denote the population size of
a single species at time t. Let b and d denote birth and death rates respectively. Then
a simple population model is [1]
d P
dt = bP −d P = r P,
where r = b −d is the intrinsic growth rate of the population. This model is valid,
in general, for short periods. Taking into account that resources are limited then the
more realistic model will be
d P
dt = r P

r > 0, K > 0 are respectively intrinsic growth and carrying capacity. Next a prey-
predator model is described. Let x(t), y(t) denote the populations of the prey and
predator species at time t respectively. Under suitable assumptions this model can
be described by the following system [1, 2]

dx
dt = ax −bxy = x(a −by), a, b > 0,
x(0) = x0,
dy
dt = −py + qxy = −y(p −qx), p, q > 0,
y(0) = y0.
Inmanyapplications,oneassumesthatthefuturestateofthesystemisindependent
of the past states and is determined solely by the present. However, under closer
scrutiny, it becomes apparent that this is often a ﬁrst order approximation to the
true situation and more realistic model would involve some of the past states of the
system. For an example

dx
dt = g(x(t), x(s), t),
t −τ ≤s < t,
x(0) = C.
Now I present a simple population delay model. Imagine a biological population
composed of adult and juvenile individuals. Let A(t) denote the density of adults at
time t. We assume that
• The length of the juvenile period is exactly h units of time for each individual.
• Adults produce offspring at a per capita rate α and that their probability per unit
of time of dying is μ.
• A newborn survives the juvenile period with probability ρ.
Let r = αρ. Then we have
d A
dt = −μA(t) + r A(t −h),
where the term r A(t −h) means that newborns become adults with some delay.
In the above discussed logistic model it was assumed that the growth rate of a
population at any time t depends on the relative number of individuals at that time. In
practice, the process of reproduction is not instantaneous. Hence the more realistic
logistic model will be
d P
dt = aP(t)

1 −P(t −τ)
N

,
where τ is a delay or lag and the equation is known as Hutchinson’s equation or
delayed logistic equation.
Let me present a population model consisting of adult and juvenile. Let A(t)
and J(t) denote adult and juvenile population respectively. Further let 10 be the
dividing line for sexually matured. Then the mathematical model for this population
problem is

Preliminaries
Deﬁnition 1 (Functional Differential Equation (FDE)) A FDE is an equation for
an unknown function which involves derivatives of the function and in which the
function, and possibly its derivatives, occur with various different arguments.
Examples:
• u′(x) = u(x −π)
(DDE),
• u′(x) = u(x) −u(x/2)
(DDE with variable delay),
• u′(x) = x2u(x) −u′(x −1)
(NFDE),
• u′(x) = u(x)u(x −1) + u(x + 2)
(DDE with advance argument),
• u′′(x) = −u′(x) + sin(u(x)) + u(x −5) + u2(x −3)
(non-linear DDE),
• u′(x) = u2(x) + 2

Deﬁnition 2 (Delay Differential Equation (DDE)) A retarded functional DE or a DE
with retarded arguments or a DDE is a FDE when the highest derivative only occurs
with one value of the arguments, and this argument is not less than the arguments of

Properties of FDE
• Propagation of discontinuity:
Consider the DDE

u′(x) = −u(x −1),
x ≥0,
u(x) = 1,
x ≤0.
Then we see that u ∈C1(0, 1] ∩C0[0, 1], u′ is discontinuous at x = 0 and u′′ is
discontinuous at x = 1.
• No injectivity:
Consider the DDE
u′(x) = u(x −1)(u(x) −1),
t ≥0.
Then u(x) = 1 is the solution for any initial function φ(x) on [−1, 0] such that
φ(0) = 1.
• Propagation of discontinuity:
Consider the FDE

u′(x) = −u′(x −1),
t ≥0,
u(x) = x,
x ≤0.
Then u′(t) has a jump discontinuity at x = 0, x = 1, · · · .
• Non uniqueness:
Consider the DDE

u′(x) = u(x −|u(x)| −1) + 1
2,
x ≥0,
u(x) = φ(x),
x ≤0.
where
φ(x) =

x < −1,

On [0, 2], u(x) = 3

Existence, Uniqueness and Stability
Consider the initial value problem

u′ = f (x, u(x), u(x −τ)),
x > 0,
u(x) = φ(x),
x ∈[−τ, 0].
(3)
On [0, τ], this IVP becomes

u′ = f (x, u(x), φ(x −τ)),
x > 0,
u(0) = φ(0),
which is an IVP for ODE with out a delay term and hence it can be solved. On
[τ, 2τ], the term u(x −τ) in f is known and the initial value u(τ) is also known.
Repetition shows the existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the data
of the solution for all x > 0.

Euler Method for Delay Differential Equations
One cannot apply directly the existing numerical method of ODE to DDEs. To
illustrate this, we consider the following IVP:

Singularly Perturbed Delay Differential Equations and Numerical Methods
47

u′(x) = u(x −τ),
x > 0, τ > 0,
u(x) = 1,
x ∈[−τ, 0].
(4)
The Euler formula for the above problem is given by

u(xi) = u(xi−1) + h(i)(u(xi−1 −τ)),
u(x) = 1,
x ∈[−τ, 0].
(5)
Note that, we used the Taylor’s expansion to discretize the DDE into difference
equation [4, 5]. But the solution is no longer smooth in the domain of differential
equation. It is smooth except at the points of the discontinuity (x = 0, 1). Since the
truncation error depends on the higher derivatives of the solution we have to
• include all the points of the discontinuity as mesh points,
• go for a non uniform mesh,
• apply an appropriate interpolation method to evaluate at the points xi −τ as they
need not fall on the mesh points.
Hence the the appropriate Euler method is

u(xi) = u(xi−1) + h(i)(uI(xi)),
i ≥1,
u(x0) = 1,
(6)
where
uI(xi) =
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
u0(xi −1),
xi ≤1,
u(x j),
xi −1 = x j, xi > 1,
(xi−1)−x j
x j+1−x j u(x j+1) + x j+1−(xi−1)
x j+1−x j
u(x j), x j < xi −1 < x j+1, xi > 1.
(7)
This method is known as continuous ODE method [6]. The above numerical method
is consistent with the DDE (4). (Local truncation error tends to zero as the mesh
parameter tends to zero.)

Singular Perturbation Problems
Deﬁnition 3 Let Pε denote the original problem and uε be its solution. Let P0 denote
the reduced problem of Pε (setting ε = 0 in Pε). Then the problem Pε is called a
Singular Perturbation Problem (SPP) if and only if uε does not converge uniformly
to u0 in the entire domain of the deﬁnition of the problem. Otherwise the problem is
called Regular Perturbation Problem (RPP) [7–9]

Numerical Methods for SPPs
In general classical numerical methods on equidistant grids yield satisfactory numer-
ical solution for singularly perturbed boundary value problems only if one uses an
unacceptably large number of grid points. Further Galerkin ﬁnite element method
even on layer adapted meshes produces an oscillation of the solution/ and its deriv-
ative. Hence one has to develop special types of numerical methods to SPPs. In the
literature various non-classical methods are available [10–17]:

Fitted Mesh Method for Second Order SPDEs [18, 19]
Consider the following BVP. Find u ∈Y = C0(Ω) ∩C2(Ω) such that

−εu′′(x) + a(x)u′(x) = f (x),

(10)
where u0, u1 are given constants, the functions a and f sufﬁciently smooth func-
tions. Further, we assume that, a(x) ≥α > 0. Since the BVP exhibits a boundary
layer at x = 1, we choose a piecewise uniform mesh on [0, 1]. For this we divide
the interval [0, 1] into two subintervals, namely Ω1 = [0, 1 −τ], [1 −τ, 1], where
τ = min{0.5, 2ε ln N/α}. Let h = 2N −1τ, H = 2N −1(1 −τ). The ﬁtted mesh

The problem (11) has a boundary layer at x = 0 and an interior layer (due to the
delay term) at x = 1. So we divide the given domain [0, 2] into four subintervals
[0, τ], [τ, 1], [1, 1 + τ] and [1 + τ, 2] where τ = 2ε ln N

On each subinterval there are N

is given by
Ω N = {0 = x0, · · · , x N

Asymptotic Numerical Method [21]
Asymptotic Numerical Method consists of 3 Steps:
• In the ﬁrst step we obtain the reduced problem solution.
• In the second step we construct an auxiliary problem.
• A numerical solution is obtained in the third step.
Step 1: Solve the reduced problem of (13).
Theorem 6 Let u be the solution of (13) and u0 be its reduced problem solution as
deﬁned in (15). Then,
| u(x) −u0(x) |≤Cε + C exp(−α(2 −x)
ε
),
x ∈Ω.
Note: From the above theorem, it is clear that the solution u of the boundary value
problem (13) exhibits a strong boundary layer at x = 2 and further, away from the
boundary layer and in particular on [0, 1], we have
| u(x) −u0(x) |≤Cε + C exp
−α
ε

,
x ∈[0, 1].
Step 2: Deﬁne an auxiliary problem to (13):
Find u∗∈Y such that

P∗u∗(x): = −εu∗′′(x) + a(x)u∗′(x) + b(x)u∗(x) = f ∗(x),
u∗(0) = u(0), u∗(2) = u(2),

f ∗(x) =

f (x) −c(x)φ(x −1),
x ∈Ω−∪{1},
f (x) −c(x)u0(x −1),
x ∈Ω+.
We now state a maximum principle for this problem.
Theorem 7 Let w ∈Y ′ be any function satisfying w(0) ≥0, w(2) ≥0, P∗w(x) ≥
0, ∀x ∈Ω−∪Ω+ and [w′](1) ≤0. Then, w(x) ≥0,
∀x ∈Ω.
Theorem 8 Let u and u∗be the solutions of the problems (13) and (22) respectively.
Then,
| u(x) −u∗(x) |≤Cε + C exp(−α
ε ),
x ∈Ω.

Theorem 9 (Discrete Maximum Principle) Suppose a mesh function Z(xi) satisﬁes

A consequence of this theorem is the following stability result.
Theorem 10 (Discrete Stability Result) Let U ∗(xi) be a numerical solution of the

the corresponding numerical solution deﬁned by (23) and (25). Then,

Theorem 12 Let U ∗(xi) be a numerical solution of (22) deﬁned by (23) and (25).
Then,
| u∗(xi) −U ∗(xi) |≤C N −1 ln N,
xi ∈Ω
2N.
Theorem 13 Let u be the solution of the problem (13) and let U ∗(xi) be a numerical
solution deﬁned by (23) with either (25) or (25). Then,
∥u −U ∗∥Ω
2N ≤C N −1 ln N.

on [−1, 0]. The above boundary value problem (26) has a solution and the solution
is unique [25].
The above problem is equivalent to ﬁnd u ∈U ∗:= C2(Ω−∪Ω+) ∩C(Ω) such
that
⎧

u(0) = φ(0), u(1−) = u(1+), u′(1−) = u′(1+), u(2) = l,
(27)
where Ω−= (0, 1) and Ω+ = (1, 2). This boundary value problem (27) exhibits
strong boundary layers at x = 0, x = 2 and strong interior layers (left and right) at
x = 1 [26].
9.3.1

the boundary value problem (27) as follows. Let

(29)
Theorem 14 The sequence {un(x)} deﬁned by (28)–(29) converges uniformly to the
solution u of the problem (27) on Ω.
9.3.2
Shishkin Mesh
Since the boundary value problem (27) and the boundary value problems (29) exhibit
boundary layers at x = 0, x = 2 and interior layers (left and right) at x = 1, we
divide the interval [0, 2] into six subintervals, namely Ω1 = [0, τ], Ω2 = [τ, 1 −τ],
Ω3 = [1 −τ, 1], Ω4 = [1, 1 + τ], Ω5 = [1 + τ, 2 −τ] and Ω6 = [2 −τ, 2], where

Abstract Singular perturbation problems, by nature, are not easy to handle and they
demand efﬁcient techniques to solve and careful analysis. And systems of singular
perturbation problems are tougher as their solutions exhibit layers with sub-layers.
Their properties are studied and examples are given to illustrate.

Introduction
Recently systems of singularly perturbed differential equations are studied by many
researchers all over the world. To cite a few: [1–20]. Most of the works are conﬁned
to systems with two equations and a few works are found on systems of n equations;
n > 0 is arbitrary. Here, three types of systems of singularly perturbed differential
equations are to be discussed.

with u(0) = φ given. E is the diagonal matrix E = diag(εi), i = 1, 2, · · · , n and
A(x) = (ai j(x)) is an n × n matrix. The functions ai j(x) and fi(x) for 1 ≤i, j ≤
n are assumed to be in C2(Ω) where Ω = [0, 1], assuming, without loss of

generality, X = 1. For convenience, the ordering ε1 < ε2 < · · · εn is assumed. Fur-
ther, the functions ai j are assumed to satisfy

j=1
j̸=i
|ai j(x)|, i = 1, 2, · · · , n
(2)
ai j(x) ≤0, 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤n
(3)
and the singular perturbation parameters εi, i = 1, 2, · · · , n are assumed to satisfy
εn ≤α
6
(4)
so as to accommodate all the layers well inside the domain.
With the above assumptions, the problem (1) has a solution u ∈C(0)(Ω) ∩
C(1)(Ω)
As explained in [21], here also the supremum norm is used in estimates. The
norms ||V|| = max1≤k≤n |Vk| for any n−vector V, ||y|| = sup0≤x≤1 |y(x)| for any
scalar-valued function y and ||y|| = max1≤k≤n ||yk|| for any vector valued function
y are introduced.
The problem (1) is singularly perturbed, in the following sense. The reduced prob-
lem obtained by putting each εi = 0, i = 1, 2, · · · , n, in (1) is the linear algebraic
system
A(x)u0(x) = f(x).
(5)
This problem (5) has a unique solution and hence arbitrary initial conditions cannot
be imposed. This shows that there are initial layers at x = 0 for u. The attracting
feature of the layers is that the component un has an initial layer of width O(εn), the
component un−1 also has a layer of width O(εn) and an additional sublayer of width
O(εn−1) and so on. Lastly the component u1 has an initial layer of width O(εn) and
additional sub-layers of widths O(εn−1), O(εn−2), · · · , O(ε1). The complexity of
the layer pattern of the solution makes the problem more interesting. This complexity
makes the derivation of bounds on the estimates of the derivatives and the error
analysis more challenging.
2.1
Analytical Results
Valarmathi and Miller [19] established the maximum principle for a general system
of ′n′ linear ﬁrst order singularly perturbed differential equations, with an additional
result that the maximum principle satisﬁed by the operator

Initial or Boundary Value Problems for Systems of Singularly Perturbed …
65
L = E D + A(x) of system (1) implies that the operator ˜L of any lower order
system also satisﬁes the maximum principle.
Apart from the stability result, estimates of the derivatives of smooth and singular
components derived with the help of induction will not sufﬁce for error analysis.
Novel estimates of derivatives are required. To achieve this, points of interaction of
the layer functions are identiﬁed. For a system of two equations, it was Linss [9]
who identiﬁed such a point. But it is Valarmathi and Miller [20] who identiﬁed a
sequence of such points between the ‘n’ layer functions and came out with some
interesting properties, which lead to non classical bounds for the derivatives of the
singular components that are interlinked.
2.2
Shishkin Mesh
The construction of an appropriate mesh plays a vital role in solving the singular
perturbation problem. As there are layer regions or inner regions and outer regions
and as more information is needed inside the inner region, a piecewise uniform mesh
is needed.
A piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh distributing N/2 points to the outer region
and the remaining N/2 points equally to all the inner regions will serve the pur-
pose. The Shishkin mesh suggested for problem (1) is the set of points Ω
N =
{x j}N
0 that divides [0, 1] into n + 1 mesh intervals [0, σ1] ∪... ∪(σn−1, σn] ∪(σn, 1]
where the n parameters σr separate the uniform meshes. With σ0 = 0, σn+1 = 1, σn
is deﬁned by σn = min
σn+1

, εn
α ln N

and for r = n −1, n −2, ..., 2, 1, σr =
min
rσr+1
r + 1 , εr
α ln N

. Then on the subinterval (σn, 1], a uniform mesh with N/2
mesh points is placed and on each of the intervals (σr, σr+1],r = 0, 1, ..., n −1, a
uniform mesh of N/2n mesh points is placed where ′n′ is the number of perturbation
parameters involved in (1).
In particular, when all the parameters σr,r = 1, 2, ..., n are with the left choice,
the Shishkin mesh becomes a classical uniform mesh with stepsize N −1 through out
from 0 to 1. For the other cases, the mesh is coarse in the outer region and becomes
ﬁner and ﬁner towards the initial point. Infact σr,r = 1, 2, 3, · · · , n are the points
only where a change in the mesh size may occur.
2.3
Discrete Problem
To solve (1) numerically, consider the corresponding discrete initial value problem
on the Shishkin mesh Ω
N given by
E D−U + AU = f on Ω N, U = u at the initial point.
(6)

66
V. Sigamani
Makinguseofthemeshgeometryandthenovelestimatesofderivativesderivedbythe
existence of the sequence of layer interaction points, the authors in [20] established
the almost ﬁrst order parameter uniform convergence.
More general case of problem (1)
In nature, many systems of multiscale dynamics, involve some components having
large scale ﬂow rates. This problem when formulated follows the form E Du + Au =
f on (0, 1] and u(0) = φ where E = diag(εi) with 0 < ε1 < ε2 < ... < εk = εk+1
= ... = εn = 1. In this case, the problem is called a partially singularly perturbed
initial value problem for a linear system of ﬁrst order ODEs.
Establishing analytical results and error analysis demand the judicial use of certain
barrier functions and the appropriate modiﬁcation of the Shishkin mesh considered
for problem (1). In the construction of the Shishkin mesh for solving problem (1),
the number of transition parameters was ﬁxed to be equal to the number of distinct
perturbation parameters in (1). Here also, having the same strategy, the outer region
gets wider as the number of transition parameters gets reduced.
2.4
Discontinuous Source Terms
In some multiscale ﬂuid ﬂows, it may also happen that some of the source functions
fi, 1 ≤i ≤n may go discontinuous at points in the domain of deﬁnition of problem
(1). These discontinuities result in some interesting characteristics of the solution.
The solution, apart from its initial layers, exhibits interior layers at the points of
discontinuity. Then care has to be taken in constructing the mesh because it should
resolve interior layers in addition to the initial layers. Further, for a simple discon-
tinuity at a point, the interior layers are just like the initial layers dislocated. These
layer functions have a similar sequence of layer interaction points. Making use of
these facts and the mesh geometry one can solve the problem with discontinuous
source function.
Example 1 Consider the following system of singularly perturbed initial value prob-
lem.

for t ∈(0, 1] and u(0) = 0. The layer proﬁle of the solution u of this problem
obtained by the proposed method is as in Fig.1 for ε1 = 10−10, ε2 = 10−7 and N =
128.

System of Second Order Differential Equations
of Reaction—Diffusion Type
Consider the system of singularly perturbed differential equations of reaction-
diffusion type with boundary values prescribed.
−Eu′′(x) + A(x)u(x) = f(x), x ∈Ω = (0, 1)
u(0), u(1) given
(7)
E is the same as in problem (1), A = (ai j)n×n, ai j(x), fi(x) ∈C2(Ω) and (2), (3)
& (4) hold good in Ω. Under these assumptions the problem (7) has a solution in
C(0)(Ω) ∩C(2)(Ω).
For systems of this type, Paramasivam et al. [16] established maximum principle,
the analytical results and a parameter uniform method of solving them on a Shishkin
mesh.
The solution u of the problem (7) exhibits twin boundary layers at the bound-
ary, x = 0 and x = 1. The component un exhibits twin boundary layers of width
O(√εn), while un−1 has twin boundary layers of width O(√εn) and additional
twin boundary sub layers of width O(√εn−1) and so on. Lastly u1 has twin bound-
ary layers of width O(√εn) and additional twin boundary sub layers of widths
O(√εn−1), O(√εn−2), · · · , O(√ε1).
These boundary layers also have twin layer interaction sequences which could be
used with the induction method in establishing the novel estimates of the derivatives
of the smooth and singular components of the solution.
The related systems of (7) which are partially singularly perturbed and which have
discontinuous source vector are with higher order difﬁculty and are handled as in the
previous case, in [22, 23].

Consider the following parabolic initial-boundary value problem for a singularly
perturbed linear system of second order differential equations

where
Ω = {(x, t) : 0 < x < 1, 0 < t ≤T },
Ω = Ω ∪Γ, Γ = ΓL ∪ΓB ∪ΓR
with u(0, t) = φL(t) on ΓL = {(0, t) : 0 ≤t ≤T }, u(x, 0)=φB(x) on ΓB = {(x,
0) : 0 < x < 1}, u(1, t) = φ R(t) on ΓR = {(1, t) : 0 ≤t ≤T }.Here,forall (x, t)
∈Ω, u(x, t) = (u1(x, t), u2(x, t), . . . , un(x, t))T ,
f(x, t) = ( f1(x, t), f2(x, t),

The problem (8) can also be written in the operator form
Lu = f on Ω, u given on Γ,
where the operator L is deﬁned by
L = I ∂
∂t −E ∂2
∂x2 + A,
where I is the identity matrix.
The reduced problem obtained by putting εi = 0, i = 1, 2, · · · , n in (8) is
deﬁned by
∂u0
∂t + Au0 = f, on Ω, u0 = u on ΓB.
(9)
The εi are assumed to be distinct and, for convenience, to have the ordering
ε1 < · · · < εn. For all (x, t) ∈Ω, it is assumed that the components ai j(x, t) of
A(x, t) satisfy the inequalities
aii(x, t) >

j=1
|ai j(x, t)| for 1 ≤i ≤n, and ai j(x, t) ≤0 for i ̸= j

and there exists a number α satisfying the inequality 0 < α < min

1≤i≤n
(

j=1
ai j(x, t)).
It is also assumed, without loss of generality, that √εn ≤
√α
6 which ensures that the
solution domain contains all the layers.
The norms, ∥V ∥= max1≤k≤n |Vk| for any n-vector V, ∥y ∥D = sup{|y(x, t)| :
(x, t) ∈D} for any scalar-valued function y and domain D, and ∥y ∥= max1≤k≤n
∥yk ∥for any vector-valued function y, are introduced. When D = Ω or Ω the
subscript D is usually dropped. In a compact domain D a function is said to be
Hölder continuous of degree λ, 0 < λ ≤1, if, for all (x1, t1), (x2, t2) ∈D,
|u(x1, t1) −u(x2, t2)| ≤C(|x1 −x2|2 + |t1 −t2|)
λ/2.
The set of Hölder continuous functions forms a normed linear space C0
λ(D) with the
norm
||u||λ,D = ||u||D +
sup
(x1,t1),(x2,t2)∈D
|u(x1, t1) −u(x2, t2)|
(|x1 −x2|2 + |t1 −t2|)λ/2 ,
where ||u||D = sup
(x,t)∈D
|u(x, t)|. For each integer k ≥1, the subspaces Ck
λ(D) of
C0
λ(D), which contain functions having Hölder continuous derivatives, are deﬁned
as follows
Ck
λ(D) = {u : ∂l+mu
∂xl∂tm ∈C0
λ(D) for l, m ≥0 and 0 ≤l + 2m ≤k}.
The norm on C0
λ(D) is taken to be ||u||λ,k,D =
max
0≤l+2m≤k || ∂l+mu
∂xl∂tm ||λ,D. For a vector
function v = (v1, v2, ..., vn), the norm is deﬁned by ||v||λ,k,D = max
1≤i≤n ||vi||λ,k,D.
Regularity and Compatibility conditions
It is assumed that enough regularity and compatibility conditions hold for the data
of the problem (8) so that the partial derivatives with respect to the space variable
of the solution are continuous up to fourth order and the partial derivatives with
respect to the time variable of the solution are continuous up to second order. The
compatibility conditions for the problem (8) deﬁned on a rectangular domain Ω is
established in [3].
Sufﬁcient conditions for the existence, uniqueness and regularity of solution of
(8) are given in the following.
Assume that A, f ∈C2
λ(Ω), φL ∈C1(ΓL), φB ∈C2(ΓB), φ R ∈C1(ΓR) and
that the following compatibility conditions are fulﬁlled at the corners (0, 0) and
(1, 0) of Γ
φB(0) = φL(0)
and
φB(1) = φ R(0),

Then there exists a unique solution u of (8) satisfying u ∈C4
λ(Ω).
As there are twin boundary parabolic layers with sub-layers, the Shishkin mesh
to resolve these layers is constructed on the rectangular domain Ω and a classical
ﬁnite difference method is suggested and proved to be parameter-uniform ﬁrst order
convergent in time and almost second order convergent in space in [3].
Example 3 Consider the problem
∂u
∂t −E ∂2u
∂x2 + Au = f on (0, 1) × (0, 1], u = 0 for x = 0 or t = 0 or x = 1,

The layer proﬁle of the solution u of this problem is displayed in Fig.3 for
ε1 = 2−7, ε2 = 2−5, ε3 = 2−2, M = 32 and N = 48.
Here for the system (8) also, its subcases of the system being partially perturbed
and the source vector to have discontinuities could also be dealt with in a way similar
to those in Sects.2 and 3.

Convergence of the Crank-Nicolson
Method for a Singularly Perturbed
Parabolic Reaction-Diffusion System
Franklin Victor, John J.H. Miller and Valarmathi Sigamani
Abstract A general parabolic system of singularly perturbed linear equations of
reaction-diffusion type is considered. The components of the solution exhibit over-
lapping layers. A numerical method with the Crank-Nicolson operator on a uniform
mesh for time and classical ﬁnite difference operator on a Shishkin piecewise uniform
mesh for space is constructed. It is proved that in the maximum norm, the numerical
approximations obtained with this method are second order convergent in time and
essentially second order convergent in space.

For a general introduction to parameter-uniform numerical methods for singular
perturbation problems, see [1–3] and for parameter-uniform numerical methods for
singularly perturbed parabolic problems, see [4–8]. In [7] the general n × n system is
considered and uniform convergence of ﬁrst order in time and essentially ﬁrst order in
space is proved. In [8], for the problem under consideration, ﬁrst order convergence
in time and essentially second order convergence in space is established. In [5], (1)
is considered in the special case n = 2. A numerical method combining the Crank-
Nicolson operator in time and a central difference operator in space on a piecewise
uniform Shishkin mesh is used. Second order convergence in time and essentially
second order convergence in space is proved under the additional restrictions √ε1 <

√ε2 ≤N −1. In the present paper these results are generalised to an n × n system.
Moreover, no restrictions of the above kind on the εi and N are required. These
results are made possible by the use of a sequence of layer interaction points, which
were introduced in [8]. A single layer interaction point was used in [6] in the special
case n = 2 and s = 1. Note that, as in [5], the power-boundedness of a family of
operators is assumed.
The plan of the paper is as follows. In Sect.2 estimates of the analytical behaviour
of the exact solution are presented without proof; these are available in [8]. In Sect.3,
the Crank-Nicolson semi-discretisation in time is deﬁned and the error is estimated.
In Sect.4, the complete discretisation in time and space is introduced. The central
difference scheme is used on a piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh for the spatial
discretisation. In Sect.5, the error of this complete discretisation is estimated.

Analytical Estimates of the Exact Solution
The proofs of all the lemmas in this section may be found in [8]. The operator L
satisﬁes the following maximum principle
Lemma 1 Let A(x, t) satisfy (2) and (3). Let ψ be any vector-valued function in
the domain of L such that ψ ≥0 on Γ . Then Lψ(x, t) ≥0 on Ω implies that
ψ(x, t) ≥0 on Ω.
Lemma 2 Let A(x, t) satisfy (2) and (3). If ψ is any vector-valued function in the
domain of L, then, for each i, 1 ≤i ≤n and (x, t) ∈Ω,
|ψi(x, t)| ≤max

The Shishkin decomposition of the exact solution u of (1) is u = v + w where
the smooth component v is the solution of Lv = f in Ω, v = u0 on Γ and the
singular component w is the solution of Lw = 0 in Ω, w = u −v on Γ. For
convenience the left and right boundary layers of w are separated using the further
decomposition w = wL + wR where LwL = 0on Ω, wL = w on ΓL, wL = 0 on
ΓB ∪ΓR and LwR = 0 on Ω, wR = won ΓR, wR = 0 on ΓL ∪ΓB.

Crank-Nicolson Semi-discretization in Time
On [0, T ], a uniform mesh with M mesh intervals, given by Ω
M
t
= {kΔt, 0 ≤k ≤
M, Δt = T/M} is considered. The following Crank-Nicolson scheme is applied on
this mesh
u0(x) = u(x, 0),
(I + Δt
2 Lx)uk+1(x) = Δt
2 (fk + fk+1)(x) + (I −Δt
2 Lx)uk(x),
uk+1(0) = u(0, tk+1), uk+1(1) = u(1, tk+1), k = 0, ..., M −1
(4)
where fk = f(x, tk), k = 0, ..., M.
It is helpful to introduce the following artiﬁcial problem:
(I + Δt
2 Lx)ˆuk+1(x) = Δt
2 (fk + fk+1)(x) + (I −Δt
2 Lx)u(x, tk),
ˆuk+1(0) = u(0, tk+1), ˆuk+1(1) = u(1, tk+1),
(5)
where the exact solution u has replaced uk in the right hand side of (4).
The operator I + Δt
2 Lx satisﬁes the following maximum principle.
Lemma 6 Let A(x, t) satisfy (2) and (3). Let ψ be any vector-valued function
in the domain of the operator I + Δt
2 Lx such that ψ(0) ≥0 and ψ(1) ≥0. Then
(I + Δt
2 Lx)ψ(x) ≥0 on (0, 1) implies that ψ(x) ≥0 on [0, 1].
Proof Let ψi∗(x∗) = min
i
min
[0,1] ψi(x). Assume that ψi∗(x∗) < 0. Then d2ψi∗
dx2 (x∗) ≥
0. From the hypotheses we have x∗/∈{0, 1}. Using (2), (3) it follows that (I +
Δt
2 Lx)i∗ψ(x∗) < 0,
The stability of the operator I + Δt
2 Lx is now established.

and (I + Δt
2 Lx)θ±(x) ≥0 on (0, 1). The result follows from Lemma 6.
The error in the solution ˆuk+1 of the artiﬁcial problem is estimated in the following
lemma.
Lemma 8 If u(x, t) is the solution of (1) and ˆuk+1(x) is the solution of (5), then, for
x ∈[0, 1] and k = 0, ..., M −1,
||u(x, tk+1) −ˆuk+1(x)|| ≤C(Δt)3.

all distinct parameters in {εr}n
1. The mesh Ω
N
x is a piecewise-uniform mesh on [0, 1]
obtained by dividing [0, 1] into 2n′ + 1 mesh-intervals as follows
[0, σ1] ∪· · · ∪(σn′−1, σn′] ∪(σn′, 1 −σn′] ∪(1 −σn′, 1 −σn′−1] ∪· · · ∪(1 −σ1, 1].
The n′ parameters σr, which determine the points separating the uniform meshes,
are deﬁned by σ0 = 0, σn′+1 = 1
2 and, for r = 1, . . . , n′,
σr = min

Clearly
0 < σ1 < . . . < σn′ ≤1

4 ≤1 −σn′ < . . . < 1 −σ1 < 1.
Then, on the sub-interval (σn′, 1 −σn′] a uniform mesh with N
2 mesh-intervals is
placed, on each of the sub-intervals (σr, σr+1] and (1 −σr+1, 1 −σr], r = 1, . . . ,
n′ −1, a uniform mesh of
N
2n′−r+2 mesh-intervals is placed and on both of the sub-
intervals [0, σ1] and (1 −σ1, 1] a uniform mesh of
N
2n′+1 mesh-intervals is placed.
In practice it is convenient to take
N = 2n′+p+1
for some natural number p. It follows that, for 2 ≤r ≤n′, in the sub-interval
[σr−1, σr] there are N/2n′−r+3 = 2r+p−2 mesh-intervals and in each of [0, σ1],
[σ1, σ2], [1 −σ2, 1 −σ1] and [1 −σ1, 1] there are N/2n′+1 = 2p. This construc-
tion leads to a class of 2n′ piecewise uniform Shishkin meshes Ω M,N. Note that these
meshes are not the same as those constructed in [7].

ˆU
k+1(x j) −Uk+1(x j) = R(u(x j, tk) −Uk(x j))
It is clear that
u(x j, tk+1) −Uk+1(x j) = (u(x j, tk+1) −ˆuk+1(x j)) + (ˆuk+1(x j) −ˆU

+( ˆU

Now,
u(x j, tk+1) −Uk+1(x j) = [u(x j, tk+1) −ˆuk+1(x j)] + [ˆuk+1(x j) −ˆU

Power-Bound of the operator R
Deﬁnition 2 The family of operators R is said to be power-bounded if ||Rl|| ≤C
for all integers l ≥0 and for some constant C independent of M, N, i, j and ε.

Convergence of the Crank-Nicolson Method …

In the following the power-boundedness of the operator R is proved for the special
case where n = 1, the co-efﬁcient function a(x, t) is a constant and the x-domain
is R.
The discrete problem corresponding to the Crank-Nicolson scheme can be restated
as
(1 + Δt
2 (−εδ2
x + a))U k(x j) = (1 −Δt
2 (−εδ2
x + a))U k−1(x j) + Δt
2 ( f k + f k−1)(x j).
(22)
where

xU k(x j) =
2
h+ −h−(U k(x j+1) −U k(x j)

).

h+−h−(sin ωh+

2 ( ˜f k + ˜f k−1)(ω)
The above can be rewritten as
(1 + L) ˜U k(ω) = (1 −L) ˜U k−1(ω) + Δt
2 ( ˜f k + ˜f k−1)(ω)
(23)
where

In order that (23) produces solution ˜U k(ω) which is bounded it sufﬁces that |R| =
|1 −L
1 + L | ≤1.
Equivalently 1 −L
1 + L .1 −L

But
L + L = Δt(a +

In the case of a system of n equations where n > 1, the coefﬁcient is a constant and
the domain is R, we have

A and E are as in (1). It is conjectured that R satisﬁes the resolvent condition of
the Kreiss matrix theorem in [10, 11] and hence is power-bounded. The power-
boundedness of the operator R, leads to the following theorem on the estimate of the
error.
Theorem 1 Assume that R is power-bounded. Let u(x, t) be the solution of (1) and
Uk+1(x j) be the solution of (18). Then, for j = 0, 1, ..., N and k = 0, 1, ..., M −1,
||u(x j, tk+1) −Uk+1(x j)|| ≤C((N −1 ln N)2 + M−2),
where C is independent of ε, i, j, N and M.
Proof Using Lemmas 8, 15 and 16, it follows that
||u(x j, tk+1) −Uk+1(x j)|| ≤C((N −1 ln N)2 + M−2),
as required.

Numerical Illustrations
In this section two problems are considered. The Crank-Nicolson method suggested
is applied to solve these problems and the results are compared with those obtained
by the method suggested in [8], where the ﬁrst order differential operator in t is
discretized using the Backward Euler scheme. To get the order of convergence in
the variable t exclusively, a ﬁne Shishkin mesh is considered for x and the resulting
problem is solved for various uniform meshes with respect to t. The two mesh
algorithm [3] is applied to get the parameter-uniform order of convergence and the
error constant.
Next a ﬁne mesh for t is considered, the resulting problem is solved, the x−order
of convergence of the method is found. From both the examples the theory that the
Crank-Nicolson method doubles the order of convergence with respect to the variable
t is well illustrated.
Example 1 Consider the problem
∂u
∂t −E ∂2u
∂x2 + Au = f on (0, 1) × (0, 1], u = 0 on Γ,
where E = (ε1, ε2, ε3), A =

A Numerical Method for a System
of Singularly Perturbed Differential
Equations of Reaction-Diffusion Type
with Negative Shift
P. Avudai Selvi and Ramanujam Narasimhan
Abstract A numerical method based on an iterative scheme is proposed for a system
of singularly perturbed differential equations of reaction-diffusion type with negative
shift term. In this method the solution of the delay problem is obtained as the limit of
the solutions to a sequence of the non-delay problems. Then non-delay problems are
solved by applying available ﬁnite difference scheme and ﬁnite element method in the
literature. An error estimate in supremum norm is derived. Numerical experiments
are carried out.

Introduction
Delay differential equations appear in various discipline, where they provide good
approximations of the observed phenomena. The problems involving these differ-
ential equations occur where the future depends not only on the immediate present,
but also on the past history of the system under consideration. A delay differen-
tial equation is said to be retarded type if the delay argument does not occur in the
highest order derivative term. Further if the highest derivative of this delay differ-
ential equation is multiplied by a small parameter, then we get singularly perturbed
delay differential equations of retarded type. Such type of equations arises frequently

in the mathematical modeling of various practical phenomena, for example, in the
modeling of the human pupil-light reﬂex [1], the study of bistable devices [2] and
variational problems in control theory [3], etc.
In general the standard numerical methods for solving singularly perturbation
problems are sometimes not stable and also they do not give desired results when
the perturbation parameter is very small. Hence many people developed suitable
numerical methods to solve singularly perturbed differential equations such that
these methods provide good accuracy which do not depend on the small parameter.
In the literature these methods are known as parameter-uniform numerical methods.
In the recent years there has been a growing interest in the area of numerical
methods to SPDDEs. In fact, Erdogan [4] proposed an exponentially ﬁtted operator
method for singularly perturbed ﬁrst order equations. Kadalbajoo and Sharma [5–7]
and Mohapatra and Natesan [8] proposed some methods for equations of reaction-
diffusion type with small delays either in function or its derivative.
Subburayan and Ramanujam [9–14] suggested two methods namely initial value
technique and asymptotic numerical method for equations of reaction-diffusion type
as well as convection-diffusion type. Nicaise and Xenophontos [15], developed a
hp-version ﬁnite element method for reaction-diffusion type DEs. In [16], the author
proposed a discontinuous Galerkin ﬁnite element method for reaction-diffusion type
DEs and established robust convergence of the method in the energy norm.
We, in this paper, using the iterative procedure given in [17], ﬁnite difference
scheme and ﬁnite element method available in the literature for system of singularly
perturbed differential equations without delay, propose a numerical method to ﬁnd
a numerical solution for the following problem:
Find u = (u1, u2), u1, u2 ∈U := C2(Ω) ∩C(Ω) such that

The present paper is organized as follows. Section2 presents the maximum prin-
ciple and the stability result. The proposed iterative procedure is explained in Sect.3.
Mesh selection strategy is discussed in Sect.4. A ﬁrst order ﬁnite difference scheme
is presented in Sect.5, where as the Sect.6 deals with the ﬁnite element method.
Numerical experiments are carried out in Sect.7. The paper concludes with a discus-
sion.
Throughout our analysis C is a generic positive constant that is independent of
parameter ε and number of mesh points N. In this paper the following supremum
norm is used:

To prove that the sequence deﬁned in the previous section converges uniformly to
the solution of the problem (2) the following result is used.

n = 0, 1, 2, · · · . Since α −β > 0,
then ηn →0 as n →∞. By the method of induction we now prove that

n = 0, 1, 2, · · · .
Clearly, |z(0)
i (x)| ≤M = η0, ∀x ∈Ω, i = 1, 2. Therefore, ||z(0)
i ||Ω ≤η0, i = 1, 2.
We now prove that ||z(1)

∀x ∈Ω, i = 1, 2. Similarly we can show that −η1 ≤z(1)

Therefore,

Hence the sequence {u(n)} converges uniformly to the solution of the problem (2).□
Note: Theorem 1 was proved under the assumption that α −β > 0 [12]. Further it
may be observed that the same assumption is used to prove the uniform convergence.
That is, no extra assumption is imposed on the coefﬁcients.

Layer Adapted Meshes
In this section we present two types of meshes namely Shishkin mesh and Bakhvalov-
Shishkin mesh (BS mesh).
4.1
Shishkin Mesh
The present paper is an extension of the work carried out in [18] from single to system.
In [18] authors mentioned that the differential equation exhibits boundary layers at
x = 0, x = 2 and interior layers (left and right) at x = 1. The same conclusion can
be made for the above problem (1) by deriving suitable estimates for the solution.
Therefore we divide the interval [0, 2] into six subintervals, namely Ω1 = [0, τ],
Ω2 = [τ, 1 −τ], Ω3 = [1 −τ, 1], Ω4 = [1, 1 + τ], Ω5 = [1 + τ, 2 −τ] and Ω6 =
[2 −τ, 2], where τ = min

. On Ω1, Ω3, Ω4 and Ω6 a uniform mesh
with N
8 mesh intervals is placed, while on Ω2 and Ω5 uniform mesh with N
4 mesh
intervals is placed.

Note: The scheme discussed in [19] is for the system of differential equations with
discontinuous source terms. It may be noted that though the systems of differential
equations in (5) has continuous source terms but the source terms are not differen-
tiable in general. Hence one can use the scheme given in [19] to the problems (5).

Discussion
A numerical method is suggested in this paper for a system of singularly perturbed
differential equations of reaction-diffusion type with negative shift. This method is
based on an iterative procedure, new and easy to implement. A numerical method
namely initial value technique for the above problem (1) is proposed in [12]. The
error estimate derived by them depends on the parameter ε though they arrived at
the maximum order of convergence as almost two. In our method though the error
estimate depends on the number of iterations, this number grows slowly with N.
Further the bound is independent of the parameter ε. Further using a ﬁnite element
method on BS mesh, we are able to improve the order of the convergence by two.

Numerical Method for a Singularly
Perturbed Boundary Value Problem
for a Linear Parabolic Second Order Delay
Differential Equation
Parthiban Swaminathan, Valarmathi Sigamani and Franklin Victor
Abstract A singularly perturbed boundary value problem for a linear parabolic
second order delay differential equation of reaction-diffusion type is considered. As
the highest order space derivative is multiplied by a singular perturbation parameter,
the solution exhibits boundary layers. Also, the delay term that occurs in the space
variable gives rise to interior layers. A numerical method which uses classical ﬁnite
difference scheme on a Shishkin piecewise uniform mesh is suggested to approximate
the solution. The method is proved to be ﬁrst order convergent uniformly with respect
to the singular perturbation parameter. Numerical illustrations are also presented.

Introduction
Singularly Perturbed Delay Differential Equations (SPDDE) are being used to model
many practical problems in different branches of science such as Biomathematics,
Control Theory, Ecology, etc.
This work is conﬁned to the class of boundary value problems for linear second
order singularly perturbed delay differential equations of parabolic type. As singular
perturbation parameter (ε) multiplies the highest order derivative term of the equa-
tion, boundary layers appear on the lateral sides of the rectangular domain. These
boundary layers are of parabolic type since the characteristic of the reduced equation

(by putting ε = 0) are parallel to the boundary. Further, due to a lag which is assumed
in the space variable, interior layers also arise. Since the classical ﬁnite difference
schemes on uniform meshes fail to give good approximations, it is essential to con-
struct a numerical method which is robust and layer resolving. General introduction
to ﬁnite difference methods to solve singularly perturbed differential equations of
parabolic reaction-diffusion type can be found in [1–5]. In [6–8] numerical methods
for singularly perturbed delay differential equations are found. In [7], a numerical
method comprising a standard ﬁnite difference operator (centered in space, implicit
in time) on a rectangular piecewise uniform ﬁtted mesh condensing at the bound-
ary layers is established to solve singularly perturbed delay differential equations of
parabolic type. The delay term is assumed to occur in time variable. This method is
proved to be uniformly convergent with respect to the parameter (ε).
Here in this paper a numerical method which uses standard ﬁnite difference
scheme on a Shishkin piecewise uniform mesh is constructed. It is proved that the
numerical approximations obtained by this method converge to the exact solution
uniformly for all the values of the parameter in the maximum norm. The plan of the
paper is as follows. In Sect.2, the problem is deﬁned and existence and regularity
of the solution of the problem are discussed. In Sect.3, the maximum principle for
the differential operator is proved and consequently the stability result is established.
And also standard estimates of the derivatives of the solution are presented. Further,
improved estimates for the derivatives of components of the solution are presented.
In Sect.4, piecewise-uniform Shishkin meshes are introduced and in Sect.5, the dis-
crete problem is deﬁned and the discrete maximum principle and the discrete stability
properties are established. In Sect.6, numerical analysis is presented and the error
bounds are established. In Sect.7, numerical illustrations are presented.

The Continuous Problem
A singularly perturbed boundary value problem for a linear parabolic second order
delay differential equation of reaction—diffusion type is considered as follows
Lu(x, t) = ∂u
∂t (x, t) −ε ∂2u
∂x2 (x, t) + a(x, t)u(x, t) + b(x, t)u(x −1, t) = f (x, t) on Ω,
u given on Γ, u(x, t) = χ(x, t), (x, t) ∈[−1, 0] × [0, T ],
(1)
where Ω = {(x, t) : 0 < x < 2, 0 < t ≤T }, ˜Ω = ((0, 1−) × (0, T ]) ∪((1+, 2) ×
(0, T ]), ˜Ω = ([0, 1−] × [0, T ]) ∪([1+, 2] × [0, T ]) Ω=Ω ∪Γ, Γ = ΓL ∪ΓB ∪
ΓR with u(0, t)=χ(0, t) on ΓL = {(0, t) : 0 ≤t ≤T }, u(x, 0) = φB(x) on ΓB =
{(x, 0) : 0 ≤x ≤2}, and u(2, t) = φR(t) on ΓR = {(2, t) : 0 ≤t ≤T }. The func-
tions χ, φB, and φR are assumed to be sufﬁciently smooth. It is to be noted that the
domain of the operator L is Mλ(Ω) = {ψ : ∂ψ
∂t , ∂2ψ
∂x2 exist on Ω}.

Standard theoretical results on the solutions of (1) are stated, without proof, in
this section. See [2, 9, 10] for more details.
For all (x, t) ∈[0, 2] × [0, T ], it is assumed that a(x, t) and b(x, t) satisfy
a(x, t) + b(x, t) > 2α, for some real number α > 0
(2)
and
b(x, t) < 0
(3)
The problem (1) can be rewritten as,
L1u(x, t) = ∂u
∂t (x, t) −ε ∂2u
∂x2 (x, t) + a(x, t)u(x, t) = g(x, t), on Ω1 = (0, 1) × (0, T ]
(4)
where g(x, t) = f (x, t) −b(x, t)χ(x −1, t)
L2u(x, t) = ∂u
∂t (x, t) −ε ∂2u
∂x2 (x, t) + a(x, t)u(x, t) + b(x, t)u(x −1, t) = f (x, t),
on Ω2 = (1, 2) × (0, T ]
(5)
u(0, t) = χ(0, t), u(x, 0) = φB(x) on ΓB1 = {(x, 0) : 0 ≤x ≤1−},u(1−, t) = u(1+, t),
u′(1−, t) = u′(1+, t), u(x, 0) = φB(x) on ΓB2 = {(x, 0) : 1+ ≤x ≤2}, u(2, t) = φR(t)
on ΓR.
The reduced problem corresponding to (4)–(5) is deﬁned by
∂u0
∂t (x, t) + a(x, t)u0(x, t) = g(x, t), on (0, 1) × (0, T ]
u0(x, 0) = φB(x), 0 ≤x ≤1
(6)
∂u0
∂t (x, t) + a(x, t)u0(x, t) + b(x, t)u0(x −1, t) = f (x, t), on (1, 2) × (0, T ]
u0(x, 0) = φB(x), 1+ ≤x ≤2.
(7)
In general as u0(x, t) need not satisfy u0(0, t) = u(0, t) and u0(2, t) = u(2, t), the
solution u(x, t) exhibits boundary layers at x = 0 and x = 2. In addition to that,
as u0(1−, t) need not be equal to u0(1+, t), the solution u(x, t) exhibits interior
layers at x = 1.
For any function y on a domain D the following norm is introduced:
∥y ∥D= sup(x,t)∈D |y(x, t)|. If D = Ω, the subscript is dropped.
In a compact domain D a function is said to be Hölder continuous of degree
λ, 0 < λ ≤1, if, for all (x1, t1), (x2, t2) ∈D,
|u(x1, t1) −u(x2, t2)| ≤C(|x1 −x2|2 + |t1 −t2|)
λ/2.

λ(D) = {u : ∂l+mu

It is assumed throughout the paper that all of the assumptions (2), (3), (8), (9), (10) and

Analytical Results
The operator L satisﬁes the following maximum principle
Lemma 1 Let ψ be any function in the domain of L such that ψ ≥0 on Γ . Then
Lψ(x, t) ≥0 on Ω implies that ψ(x, t) ≥0 on Ω.
Proof Let x∗, t∗be such that ψ(x∗, t∗) = min ¯Ω ψ(x, t) and assume that the lemma
is false. Then ψ(x∗, t∗) < 0. From the hypotheses we have (x∗, t∗) /∈Γ. With
∂ψ
∂t (x∗, t∗−) ≤0 and ∂2ψ
∂x2 (x∗, t∗) ≥0,
Lψ(x∗, t∗) = ∂ψ
∂t (x∗, t∗) −ε ∂2ψ
∂x2 (x∗, t∗) + a(x∗, t∗)ψ(x∗, t∗) + b(x∗, t∗)ψ(x∗−1, t∗)
< 0
as ψ(x∗−1, t∗) ≥ψ(x∗, t∗).
This contradicts the assumption and proves the result of L.
As a consequence, the stability result for the problem (1) follows and is as stated in
Lemma 2 If ψ is any function in the domain of L, then for all (x, t) ∈Ω,
|ψ(x, t)| ≤max

.
Proof Deﬁne the two functions

± ψ(x, t).
Using the properties of a(x, t) and b(x, t), it is not hard to verify that θ±(x, t) ≥0
for (x, t) ∈Γ and Lθ± ≥0 on Ω. It follows from Lemma 1 that θ± ≥0 on ¯Ω.

Proof Following steps as in [2, 6], the required bounds are derived.
The Shishkin decomposition of the exact solution u of (1) is u = v + w where
the smooth component v is the solution of
L1v = g on (0, 1−) × (0, T ], v(0, t) = u0(0, t), v(x, 0) = φB(x), v(1−, t) = u0(1−, t)

(13)
and the singular component w is the solution of
L1w = 0 on (0, 1) × (0, T ], L2w = 0 on (1, 2) × (0, T ]
with w(0, t) = u(0, t) −v(0, t), [w](1, t) = −[v](1, t), [w ′](1, t) = −[v ′](1, t),
w(2, t) = u(2, t) −v(2, t), w(x, 0) = 0.

x is chosen to be
a piecewise-uniform mesh with N mesh-intervals on [0, 2]. The interval [0, 1] is
divided into 3 sub-intervals as follows

and on each of the sub-intervals [0, τ] and (1 −τ, 1], a uniform mesh of N

points is placed.
Similarly, the interval (1, 2] is also divided into 3 sub-intervals (1, 1 + τ], (1 +

τ takes on its lefthand value, the Shishkin mesh Ω
N becomes a classical uniform
mesh throughout from 0 to 2.
In practice, it is convenient to take

it does not necessarily change at each of these points. The following notations
are introduced: h j = x j −x j−1, h j+1 = x j+1 −x j and if x j = τ, then h−

The Discrete Problem
In this section, a classical ﬁnite difference operator with an appropriate Shishkin
mesh is used to construct a numerical method for (1) which is shown later to be
essentially ﬁrst order parameter-uniform convergent.
The discrete two-point boundary value problem is now deﬁned on any mesh by the
ﬁnite difference method

The problem (18) can be rewritten as
L M,N

U(x j, tk) = D−
t U(x j, tk) −εδ2
xU(x j, tk) + a(x j, tk)U(x j, tk) = g(x j, tk) on Ω−M,N
where g(x j, tk) = f (x j, tk) −b(x j, tk)χ(x j −1, tk)

u(x j, tk). Then the local truncation error L M,Ne(x j, tk), for j ̸= N/2, has the decom-
position
L M,Ne(x j, tk) = L M,N(V −v)(x j, tk) + L M,N(W −w)(x j, tk).
The error in the smooth and singular components are bounded in the following
theorem.

A Parameter Uniform Numerical Method
for an Initial Value Problem for a System
of Singularly Perturbed Delay Differential
Equations with Discontinuous Source Terms
Nagarajan Shivaranjani, John J.H. Miller and Valarmathi Sigamani
Abstract In this paper an initial value problem for a system of singularly perturbed
ﬁrst order delay differential equations with discontinuous source terms is considered
on the interval (0, 2]. The source terms are assumed to have simple discontinuities
at the point d ∈(0, 2). The components of the solution exhibit initial layers and
interior layers. The interior layers occuring in the solution are of two types-interior
layers due to delay and interior layers due to the discontinuity of the source terms.
A numerical method composed of the standard backward difference operator and
a piecewise-uniform Shishkin mesh which resolves the initial and interior layers
is suggested. This method is proved to be essentially ﬁrst order convergent in the
maximum norm uniformly in the perturbation parameters. Numerical illustrations
are provided to support the theory.

Introduction
Singularly perturbed delay differential equations play an important role in the mod-
elling of several physical and biological phenomena like ﬁrst exit time problems
in modelling of activation of neuronal variability [2], bistable devices [18], evolu-
tionary biology [3] and a variety of models for physiological processes or diseases

[4–6, 13]. These systems also ﬁnd applications in Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction
(BZ reaction) models and the modelling of biological oscillators [3].
In [7], the authors have considered an initial value problem for a system of sin-
gularly perturbed ﬁrst order delay differential equations and have established the
parameter uniform convergence of the numerical method suggested. In this paper,
the following system which is similar to the one considered in [7] with discontinuous
source terms is considered:
Lu(x) := Eu′(x) + A(x)u(x) + B(x)u(x −1) = f(x), x ∈(0, d) ∪(d, 2], (1)
u(x) = φ(x), x ∈[−1, 0],
(2)
and f(d−) ̸= f(d+) for some d ∈(0, 2).
(3)
For all x ∈[0, 2], u(x) = (u1(x), u2(x))T and f(x) = ( f1(x), f2(x))T . E, A(x),
B(x) are 2 × 2 matrices. E = diag(ε), ε = (ε1, ε2) with 0 < ε1 < ε2 ≤1, B(x) =
diag(b(x)), b(x) = (b1(x), b2(x)). For all x ∈[0, 2], it is assumed that the compo-
nents ai j(x), bi(x) of A(x) and B(x) respectively satisfy
bi(x), ai j(x) ≤0 for 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤2 and aii(x) >

i̸= j
|ai j(x) + bi(x)| and (4)
0 < α < min
x∈[0,2]
1≤i≤2
(
2

j=1
ai j(x) + bi(x)) for some α. (5)
Further, the functions ai j(x), bi(x), 1 ≤i, j ≤2 are assumed to be in C(2)([0, 2])
and φi(x) are assumed to be in C(2)([−1, 0]). It is to be noted that L can operate on
functions in the domain C0(0, 2] ∩C1((0, d) ∪(d, 2]).
For any function h, the jump of h at d is denoted by [h](d) = (h)(d+) −(h)(d−).
Here the function f is assumed to have a jump of ﬁnite magnitude at d. Since f is
discontinuous at d, the solution u of (1) does not necessarily have a continuous ﬁrst
order derivative at the point d. The cases (i) d ∈(0, 1) and (ii) d ∈(1, 2) are dealt
with separately.
Case (i):
In this case, the components u1 and u2 have initial layers of width O(ε2) at x = 0 and
interior layers of width O(ε2) at x = 1, x = d and x = 1 + d while the component
u1 has additional layers of width O(ε1) at x = 0, x = 1, x = d and x = 1 + d.
Case (ii):
In this case, the components u1 and u2 have initial layers of width O(ε2) at x = 0
and interior layers of width O(ε2) at x = 1 and x = d while the component u1 has
additional layers of width O(ε1) at x = 0, x = 1 and x = d.
In the case when d = 1, the solution proﬁle is similar as that for the problem
considered in [7]. The components u1 and u2 have initial layers of width O(ε2)
at x = 0 and interior layers of width O(ε2) at x = 1 while the component u1 has

A Parameter Uniform Numerical Method for an Initial Value Problem for a System …
137
additional layers of width O(ε1) at x = 0 and x = 1. As the solution proﬁle for this
case is same as in [7], the estimates of the derivatives and the construction of Shishkin
mesh for this case are as in [7]. Hence in the rest of the paper, the cases (i) and (ii)
are discussed in detail.
For any vector-valued function y on [0, 2] the following norms are introduced:
∥y(x) ∥= maxi |yi(x)| and ∥y ∥= sup{∥y(x) ∥: x ∈[0, 2]}. For any mesh func-
tion V on Ω
N = {x j}N
j=0 the following discrete maximum norms are introduced:
∥V(x j) ∥= maxi |Vi(x j)| and ∥V ∥= max{∥V(x j) ∥: x j ∈Ω
N}.
Throughout this paper C denotes a generic positive constant, which is independent
of x and of the two singular perturbation and discretization parameters. Furthermore,
inequalities between vectors are understood in the componentwise sense.
The plan of the paper is as follows: In Sect.2, analytical results are presented.
In Sects.3 and 4, appropriate Shishkin meshes are constructed for each case and
corresponding numerical analysis is presented. In Sect.5, the bound for the error
of the discretisation is established in the maximum norm followed by numerical
illustrations in Sect.6.

Analogous construction shows that the solution exists for the case when d = 1.
In the case when d ̸= 1, u′(1) exists and is continuous at 1 as f (1) is well deﬁned
and is continuous at 1.
The operator L satisﬁes the following maximum principle.
Lemma 1 Let ψ be any function in the domain of L. Let ψ(0) ≥0. Then Lψ ≥0
on (0, d) ∪(d, 2], [ψ](d) = 0 implies that ψ(x) ≥0 on [0, 2].
Proof Let ψi∗(x∗) = mini,x{ψ(x)} and assume ψi∗(x∗) < 0. Without loss of gen-
erality let i∗= 1. By the hypothesis, x∗̸= 0 and note that ψ′
1(x∗) ≤0. Suppose
x∗∈(0, 1] −{d}, then,
(Lψ)1(x∗) = (L1ψ)1(x∗) = ε1ψ′
1(x∗) + a11(x∗)ψ1(x∗)
+a12(x∗)ψ2(x∗)
≤(a11 + a12)(x∗)ψ1(x∗)
< 0,
which is a contradiction.
Suppose x∗∈(1, 2] −{d}, then,
(Lψ)1(x∗) = (L2ψ)1(x∗) = ε1ψ′
1(x∗) + a11(x∗)ψ1(x∗)
+a12(x∗)ψ2(x∗) + b1(x∗)ψ1(x∗−1)
≤((a11 + a12)(x∗) + b1(x∗))ψ1(x∗)
< 0,
which is a contradiction.
Suppose x∗= d, then, (2
j=1 a1 j(d) + b1(d))ψ1(d) < 0, and there exists a
neighborhood Nh = (d −h, d) such that (2
j=1 a1 j(x) + b1(x))ψ1(x) < 0 for all
x ∈Nh. If ψ′
1(x) < 0 for an x1 ∈Nh, then (Lψ)1(x1) < 0. Suppose ψ′
1(x) > 0 for
all x ∈Nh then ψ1 is an increasing function in Nh and hence cannot attain its mini-
mum at x = d which is a contradiction.

Proof Following the procedure adopted in [7], in each domain, the required bounds
are derived.
There exists a unique point x∗in (0, 1], such that
ε−1
1 B0,1(x∗) = ε−1
2 B0,2(x∗), ε−1
1 B1,1(1 + x∗) = ε−1
2 B1,2(1 + x∗), ε−1

= ε−1
2 Bd,2(d + x∗) and ε−1
1 B1+d,1(1 + d + x∗) = ε−1
2 B1+d,2(1 + d + x∗).
The properties of this point are judicially used in deriving the novel estimates for
the derivatives of the singular components.
The existence, uniqueness and properties of this point are derived in [1].
For the parameter-uniform convergence of the method suggested, the singular
component is further decomposed as follows:
w1(x) = w1,1(x) + w1,2(x),
w2(x) = w2,1(x) + w2,2(x).
Following the steps in [1], it is not hard to derive the following estimates.

Shishkin Mesh
The Shishkin mesh Ω
N = {x j}N
j=0 is constructed on Ω = [0, 2] as follows for the
case (i) when ε1 < ε2. In the case ε1 = ε2 a simpler construction requiring just two
parameters τ and σ sufﬁces. The interval [0, 1] is subdivided into 6 sub-intervals
[0, τ1] ∪(τ1, τ2] ∪(τ2, d] ∪(d, d + τ3]∪, (d + τ3, d + τ4] ∪(d + τ4, 1]. The para-
meters τr, r = 1, 2, 3, 4, which determine the points separating the uniform meshes,
are deﬁned by
τ2 = min
d
2 , ε2

, τ1 = min

, τ4 = min

and
τ3 = min

τ4

α ln N

.
Then, on each of the sub-intervals (τ2, d] and (d + τ4, 1] a uniform mesh
with
N
8
mesh points is placed and on each of the remaining sub-intervals a uni-
form mesh of
N
16
mesh points is placed. Similarly, the interval [1, 2] is also
divided into 6 sub-intervals [1, 1 + τ1] ∪(1 + τ1, 1 + τ2] ∪(1 + τ2, 1 + d] ∪(1 +
d, 1 + d + τ3] ∪(1 + d + τ3, 1 + d + τ4] ∪(1 + d + τ4, 2] having the same num-
ber of mesh intervals as in [0, 1].
For case (ii), the Shishkin mesh is constructed as follows: The interval [0, 1]
is subdivided into 3 sub-intervals [0, τ1] ∪(τ1, τ2] ∪(τ2, 1] and the interval [1, 2]
is divided into 6 sub-intervals [1, 1 + τ3] ∪(1 + τ3, 1 + τ4] ∪(1 + τ4, d] ∪(d, 1 +
τ5]∪, (1 + τ5, 1 + τ6] ∪(1 + τ6, 2]. On each of the intervals (τ2, 1], (1 + τ4, d] and
(1 + τ6, 2], a uniform mesh with N
6 points is placed and in each of the remaining inter-
vals a uniform mesh with N
12 mesh points is placed. The parameters τr, r = 1, 2..., 6
are deﬁned as follows:
τ2 = min

The Discrete Problem
The IVP (6)–(7) is discretised using the backward Euler scheme applied on the
piecewise uniform ﬁtted mesh Ω
N. The discrete problem for case (i) is
LNU(x j) = E D−U(x j) + A(x j)U(x j) + B(x j)U(x j −1) = f(x j),
j = 1(1) N
4 −1, N
4 + 1(1)N,
(8)
εi(D+ −D−)Ui(x N
4 ) = [ fi](x N
4 ), i = 1, 2.
(9)
U(0) = u(0).
(10)
The discrete problem for case (ii) is
LNU(x j) = E D−U(x j) + A(x j)U(x j) + B(x j)U(x j −1) = f(x j),
j = 1(1)2N
3 −1, 2N
3 + 1(1)N,
(11)
εi(D+ −D−)Ui(x 2N
3 ) = [ fi](x 2N
3 ), i = 1, 2,
(12)
U(0) = u(0).
(13)
Lemma 5 Let Z be any vector mesh function such that Z(x0) ≥0, LNZ(x j) ≥0
for all x j ∈Ω N and (D+ −D−)Z(x N
4 ) ≤0 in case (i) and (D+ −D−)Z(x 2N
3 ) ≤0
in case (ii) then Z(x j) ≥0 for all x j ∈Ω
N.
Proof Let xk be such that Z attains its minimum on Ω
N. Further, suppose (Z)i(xk) <
0. If xk ∈(0, 1] or if xk ∈[1, 2] and xk ̸= d then, (LNZ)i(xk) < 0 which is a con-
tradiction. If xk = d then, (D−Z)i(xk) ≤0 ≤(D+Z)i(xk) as Z attains its mini-
mumat xk.Alsofromhypothesis,(D+Z)i(xk) ≤(D−Z)i(xk).Hence,(D−Z)i(xk) ≤
0 ≤(D+Z)i(xk) ≤(D−Z)i(xk) which implies Zi(xk−1) = Zi(xk) = Zi(xk+1) < 0.
Now, (LNZ)i(xk−1) < 0 which is a contradiction.

Error Analysis
The error at each point x j ∈¯Ω N is denoted by e(x j) = U(x j) −u(x j). For case
(i) when j ̸= N
4 , for case (ii), when j ̸= 2N
3 and for the case d = 1 when j ̸= N
2 ,
following steps as in [1], it can be derived that
|(LNe)i(x j)| ≤C N −1 ln N, i = 1, 2.

Numerical Illustration
In this section, a singularly perturbed linear system of delay differential equations
is considered for numerical illustration. The source term of the system has a point
of discontinuity d inside the domain of deﬁnition. All the three cases when (i) d ∈
(0, 1) (ii) d ∈(1, 2) and (iii) d = 1 are considered. Appropriate Shishkin meshes are
constructed and the resulting discrete problems (8)–(13) are solved. The results are
presented in the tables and ﬁgures. It is to be noted that the error constants presented
in the tables are approximations to the error constant C derived in the error bound
(14).

with the theoretical results.
The ﬁgure displays the numerical solution for the problem (15)–(19), computed
for N = 8192, ε1 = 2−17, ε2 = 2−15 and d = 0.4. The components u1 and u2 have

A Parameter-Uniform First Order
Convergent Numerical Method for a
Semi-linear System of Singularly Perturbed
Second Order Delay Differential Equations

Abstract In this paper, a boundary value problem for a semi-linear system of two
singularly perturbed second order delay differential equations is considered on the
interval (0, 2). The components of the solution of this system exhibit boundary layers
at x = 0 and x = 2 and interior layers at x = 1. A numerical method composed of
a classical ﬁnite difference operator applied on a piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh
is suggested to solve the problem. The method is proved to be ﬁrst order conver-
gent in the maximum norm uniformly in the perturbation parameters. Numerical
computation is described, which supports the theoretical results.

Introduction
Delay differential equations are common in the mathematical modelling of various
physical, biological phenomena and control theory [1, 2]. A subclass of these equa-
tions consists of singularly perturbed ordinary differential equations with a delay.
Such equations arise frequently in the mathematical modelling of various practical
phenomena, for example, in the modelling of human pupil-light reﬂex [3], models of
HIV infection [4], the study of bistable devices in digital electronics [5], variational
problems in control theory [6], ﬁrst exit time problems in modelling of activation of

neuronal variability [7], evolutionary biology [8], mathematical ecology [9], popu-
lation dynamics [10] and in a variety of models for physiological processes [11].
Investigation of boundary value problems for singularly perturbed linear second-
order differential-difference equations was initiated by Lange and Miura [7].
The singularly perturbed boundary value problem for a semi-linear system of
delay differential equations under consideration here is
Tu(x) : = −E u ′′(x) + f(x, u) + B(x) u(x −1) = 0 on Ω = (0, 2)
(1)
with u = φ on [−1, 0] and u(2) = l,
(2)
where φi ∈C2([−1, 0]), i = 1, 2. For all x ∈[0, 2] = Ω, u(x) = (u1(x), u2(x))T
andf(x, u) = ( f1(x, u), f2(x, u))T . E, and B(x)are2 × 2matrices. E = diag(ε),
ε = (ε1, ε2) with 0 < ε1 < ε2 ≤1, B(x)=diag(b(x)), b(x) = (b1(x), b2(x)). The
special cases ε2 = 1 and ε1 = ε2 are simpler and could be treated with numeri-
cal schemes on modiﬁed meshes. For all (x, u) ∈Ω × R2, it is assumed that the
nonlinear terms satisfy
∂fk(x, u)
∂uk
≥β > 0, ∂fk(x, u)
∂u j
≤0, k, j = 1, 2, k ̸= j,

bi(x) ≤0, i = 1, 2.
(5)
Further, it is assumed that fi ∈C2(Ω × R2) and bi ∈C2(Ω), i = 1, 2. The
above assumptions ensure that u ∈C where C = C 0(Ω) ∩C 1(Ω) ∩C 2((0, 1) ∪
(1, 2)).
The components u1 and u2 have boundary layers of width O(ε2) at x = 0 and
x = 2 and interior layers of width O(ε2) at x = 1, while the component u1 has addi-
tional boundary layers of width O(ε1) at x = 0 and x = 2 and interior layers of
width O(ε1) at x = 1.
The problem (1)–(2) can be rewritten as
−E u ′′(x) + f(x, u) + B(x) φ(x −1) = 0 on (0, 1),
(6)
−E u ′′(x) + f(x, u) + B(x) u(x −1) = 0 on (1, 2),
(7)
u(0) = φ(0), u(2) = l, u(1−) = u(1+) and u ′(1−) = u ′(1+).

(9)
T2u(x) := −E u ′′(x) + f(x, u) + B(x) u(x −1) = 0 on (1, 2),
(10)
where g(x, u) = f(x, u) + B(x) φ(x −1).
The reduced problem corresponding to (9)–(10) is deﬁned by
g(x, r) = 0 on (0, 1),
(11)
f(x, r) + B(x) r(x −1) = 0 on (1, 2).
(12)
The implicit function theorem and conditions (3)–(5) ensure the existence of a
unique solution for (11) and (12).
The solution r has derivatives which are bounded independently of ε1 and ε2.
Hence,
|r(k)
1 (x)| ≤C,
|r(k)
2 (x)| ≤C,
k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, x ∈[0, 2].
(13)
For any vector-valued function y on [0, 2] the following norms are introduced:
∥y(x) ∥= maxi |yi(x)| and ∥y ∥= sup{∥y(x) ∥: x ∈[0, 2]}. For any mesh func-
tion V on Ω
N = {x j}N
j=0 the following discrete maximum norms are introduced:
∥V(x j) ∥= maxi |Vi(x j)| and ∥V ∥= max{∥V(x j) ∥: x j ∈Ω
N}.
Throughout the paper C denotes a generic positive constant, which is independent
of x and of all singular perturbation and discretization parameters. Furthermore,
inequalities between vectors are understood in the componentwise sense.

Analytical Results
The following Shishkin decomposition of the solution u of (1)–(2) is considered:
u = v + w
where the smooth component v(x) is the solution of
−E v ′′(x) + g(x, v) = 0 on (0, 1), v(0) = r(0), v(1−) = r(1−),
(14)
−E v ′′(x) + f(x, v) + B(x) v(x −1) = 0 on (1, 2), v(1+) = r(1+), v(2)=r(2)

and the singular component w(x) is the solution of
−E w ′′(x) + g(x, v + w) −g(x, v) = 0 on (0, 1),
(16)
−E w ′′(x) + f(x, v + w) −f(x, v) + B(x) w(x −1) = 0 on (1, 2),
(17)
w(0) = u(0) −v(0), w(2) = u(2) −v(2), [w](1) = −[v](1), and [w′](1) = −[v′](1),
(18)
where for any function h, the jump at x is, [h](x) = h(x+) −h(x−).

The Shishkin Mesh
A piecewise uniform Shishkin mesh with N mesh-intervals is now constructed on
[0, 2] as follows. Let Ω N = Ω1N ∪Ω2N where Ω1N={x j}
N
2 −1
j=1 , Ω2N = {x j}N−1
j= N
2 +1
and x N
2 = 1.ThenΩ1

N = {x j}N
j= N
2 , Ω1
N ∪Ω2
N = Ω
N={x j}N
j=0
and Γ N = {0, 2}. As the solution exhibits overlapping layers at x = 0 and x =
2 and interior overlapping layers at x = 1, a Shishkin mesh is constructed to
resolve these layers. The interval [0, 1] is subdivided into 5 sub-intervals as fol-
lows [0, τ1] ∪(τ1, τ2] ∪(τ2, 1 −τ2] ∪(1 −τ2, 1 −τ1] ∪(1 −τ1, 1]. The parameter
τr,r = 1, 2, which determine the points separating the uniform meshes, are deﬁned
by
τ2 = min
1
4, 2√ε2
√α ln N

and τ1 = min
τ2
2 , 2√ε1
√α ln N

.
On the sub-interval (τ2, 1 −τ2] a uniform mesh with N
4 mesh points is placed
and on each of the sub-intervals [0, τ1], (τ1, τ2], (1 −τ2, 1 −τ1] and (1 −τ1, 1],
a uniform mesh of
N
16 mesh points is placed. Similarly, the interval (1, 2] is also
divided into 5 sub-intervals (1, 1 + τ1], (1 + τ1, 1 + τ2], (1 + τ2, 2 −τ2], (2 −
τ2, 2 −τ1] and (2 −τ1, 2], using the same parameters τ1 andτ2. In particular, when
both the parameters τ1 andτ2 takes on their lefthand value, the Shishkin mesh Ω
N
becomes a classical uniform mesh throughout from 0 to 2. In practice, it is conve-
nient to take N = 16k, k ≥3. From the above construction of Ω
N, it is clear that the
transition points {τr, 1 −τr, 1 + τr, 2 −τr},r = 1, 2, are the only points at which
the mesh-size can change and that it does not necessarily change at each of these
points.

The Discrete Problem
In this section, a classical ﬁnite difference operator with an appropriate Shishkin
mesh is used to construct a numerical method for (1)–(2) which is shown later to be
essentially ﬁrst order parameter-uniform convergent.
The discrete two-point boundary value problem is deﬁned to be
TN U(x j) := −E δ2U(x j) + f(x j, U(x j)) + B(x j)U(x j −1) = 0, 1 ≤j ≤N −1,
(50)
U(x0) = u(x0), D−U(xN/2) = D+U(xN/2) and U(xN) = u(xN).
(51)
The problem (50)–(51) can be rewritten as
T1NU(x j) := −E δ2U(x j) + g(x j, U(x j)) = 0, 1 ≤j ≤N
2 −1,
(52)

160
M. Manikandan et al.
T2NU(x j) := −E δ2U(x j) + f(x j, U(x j)) = −B(x j)U(x j −1),
N
2 + 1 ≤j ≤N −1,
(53)
U(x0) = u(x0), D−U(xN/2) = D+U(xN/2) and U(xN) = u(xN).
(54)
For x j ∈Ω N
1 ,
(T1NY −T1NZ)(x j)
= −E δ2(Y −Z)(x j) + g(x j, Y(x j)) −g(x j, Z(x j))
= −E δ2(Y −Z)(x j) + ∂g
∂u1
(x j, K(x j))(Y1 −Z1) + ∂g
∂u2
(x j, K(x j))(Y2 −Z2)
= T′
1N(Y −Z)(x j).
Similarly for x j ∈Ω N
2 ,
(T2NY −T2NZ)(x j)
= −E δ2(Y −Z)(x j) + f(x j, Y(x j)) −f(x j, Z(x j))
= −E δ2(Y −Z)(x j) + ∂f
∂u1
(x j, M(x j))(Y1 −Z1) + ∂f
∂u2
(x j, M(x j))(Y2 −Z2)
= T′
2N(Y −Z)(x j)
where ∂g
∂ui
(x j, K(x j)) and ∂f
∂ui
(x j, M(x j)), i = 1, 2, are intermediate values and
T′
1N and T′
2N are the Frechet derivatives of T1N and T2N respectively. Since T′
1N
and T′
2N are linear, they satisfy the discrete maximum principle and discrete stability
result in [15]. Hence,
∥Y −Z ∥≤C ∥T′
1N(Y −Z) ∥= C ∥T1NY −T1NZ ∥on Ω N
1
and
∥Y −Z ∥≤C ∥T′
2N(Y −Z) ∥= C ∥T2NY −T2NZ ∥on Ω N
2 .
i.e.
∥Y −Z ∥≤C ∥T1NY −T1NZ ∥on Ω N
1
(55)
and
∥Y −Z ∥≤C ∥T2NY −T2NZ ∥on Ω N
2 .

Lemma 3 Let u be the solution of the problem (1)–(2) and U be the solution of the
discrete problem (52)–(54). Then for j ̸= N
2 ,
∥U −u ∥≤C (N −1 ln N)2.
(57)
Proof Let x j ∈Ω N
1 . From (55),
∥U −u ∥≤C ∥T1NU −T1Nu ∥.
Consider,
∥T1Nu ∥=∥T1Nu −T1NU ∥.
Hence,
∥T1Nu −T1NU ∥= ∥T1Nu ∥
= ∥T1Nu −T1u ∥
= E ∥(δ2u −u′′)(x j) ∥
≤E (∥(δ2v −v′′)(x j) ∥+ ∥(δ2w −w′′)(x j) ∥).
Since the bounds for v and w are the same as in [14], the required result follows on
Ω N
1 .
Let x j ∈Ω N
2 . From (56),
∥U −u ∥≤C ∥T2NU −T2Nu ∥
≤C ∥B(x j)(U −u)(x j −1) ∥, from (53)
≤C ∥U −u ∥Ω N
1
≤C (N −1 ln N)2.
Hence for j ̸= N
2 , ∥U −u ∥≤C (N −1 ln N)2.

The error at each point x j ∈Ω
N is denoted by e(x j) = U(x j) −u(x j).
At the point x j = xN/2, for i = 1, 2,

Theorem 1 Let u(x j) be the solution of the problem (1)–(2) and U(x j) be the solu-
tion of the discrete problem (50)–(51). Then,
∥U(x j) −u(x j) ∥≤C N −1 ln N, 0 ≤j ≤N.

in [14] to the linear operators T′

u(x) = (1, 1)T , for x ∈[−1, 0], u(2) = (1, 1)T ,
