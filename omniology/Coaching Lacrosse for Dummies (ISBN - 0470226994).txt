Dedication
This one’s for Jeff and Jodie. Even though they cheer for the wrong team
they’re still the best brother and sister-in-law around. — Greg Bach 
This book is dedicated to all the volunteer lacrosse coaches who give 
up countless hours of their free time to work with children and ensure that
they have positive, safe, and rewarding experiences. We applaud their 
efforts and commend them for making a difference in the lives of youngsters
everywhere. — National Alliance For Youth Sports
Authors’ Acknowledgments
A successful youth lacrosse program doesn’t just happen. It takes a lot of
work and a real commitment from not only dedicated volunteer coaches, but
also parents who understand their roles and responsibilities, and league
directors and administrators who ensure that every child who steps on the
field in their community has a safe, fun, and rewarding experience. Lacrosse
plays an important role in the lives of many children. It provides an opportu-
nity to learn the skills of the game and the chance to develop emotionally and
physically as individuals. The National Alliance For Youth Sports extends a
heartfelt thank you to everyone who makes a positive difference through
lacrosse in the life of a child.
First, a big thank you to Stacy Kennedy, whose efforts behind the scenes in
working with the National Alliance For Youth Sports has resulted in this, the
fifth book in a series for youth coaches; Kathy Simpson and Tracy Brown
Collins made a huge difference in the quality of every page of this book; and
the wonderful illustrations put together by Joni Burns, Shane Johnson,
Shelley Norris, and Rashell Smith to supplement many of the techniques 
and drills covered; and John Clarke, who was a terrific asset with all of his 
in-depth knowledge about every aspect of the sport.

Introduction
W
elcome to Coaching Lacrosse For Dummies, a book dedicated to helping
all the wonderful volunteer coaches who sign up to introduce kids 
to this magnificent sport. Lacrosse is the ultimate team game — 10 players
working as one in boys’ lacrosse, and 12 players attacking and defending as a
unit in girls’ lacrosse. The action-packed nature of the game attracts children
of all ages and abilities who want to take shots, deliver passes, and defend
opponents. Lacrosse features a unique blend of skills and has mass appeal
because anyone — regardless of size, speed, or strength — can find a position
on the field to excel in.
This book is packed with valuable information on all aspects of the game and
is a useful guide in your quest to ensure that the youngsters on your team
have a fun, safe, and rewarding experience. You and your kids will remember
this season for years to come!
About This Book
We wrote this book to assist first-time volunteer youth lacrosse coaches who
are looking for some guidance before they take the field, as well as for more-
experienced coaches who want additional insight into different aspects of the
game, such as upgrading offensive attacks or defensive strategies.
If you’re new to coaching youth lacrosse or just learning about the game in
general, you probably feel a bit apprehensive about your ability to teach the
many components of this complex game. Don’t worry; this feeling is natural.
The book you’re holding provides the essential information you need to do 
a great job and be a success with your players. Each chapter is packed with
information you can use to make a difference in your players’ development —
from attacking on offense to denying scoring opportunities on defense to just
having fun. The more chapters you read, the more knowledgeable and confi-
dent you’ll become, which will help you have a bigger impact on your team.
For those of you who have already been through a season or two, and who
understand practice planning and basic game-day responsibilities, we provide
plenty of in-depth advice to help you guide your team to the next level (and
beyond). In addition to all the basics, we cover drills you can use to raise play-
ers’ skills operating with the player advantage, winning face-off battles, and
dealing with picks. We also discuss advanced strategies you can employ.

Conventions Used in This Book
To help guide you through this book, we use the following conventions:
 Italic text for emphasis and to highlight new words or phrases that we
define in the text
 Boldface text to indicate key words in bulleted lists and the action parts
of numbered steps
 Sidebars — the shaded gray boxes that you see in some of the chapters —
to present information that’s interesting but not critical to your under-
standing of the chapter or topic
Mixed genders — he and she — are interchanged throughout this book in 
discussing everything from techniques to drills, because the bulk of the 
material works for coaches of both boys’ and girls’ lacrosse. Also, when you
encounter we, that word refers to the National Alliance For Youth Sports,
which is America’s leading advocate for positive and safe sports for kids.
What You’re Not to Read
If you ask us, every single page of this book is filled with valuable information
that you don’t want to miss. But we have to share a little secret with you: 
You really don’t have to read every single word. Take the sidebars you come
across from time to time: These boxes feature interesting information that
you can skip if you are pressed for time or have a lacrosse practice to get to.
Foolish Assumptions
Following are some things that we assume about you, our reader:
 You know that players in lacrosse use sticks that have pockets and net-
ting on the end to hold the ball, and that these sticks are used to carry
the ball, pass it to teammates, or take shots in an attempt to score goals
against the opponent.
 You’re a first-time lacrosse coach or someone who is fairly new to the
sport, and you’re looking for information on how to manage a youth team.
 You have a son or daughter who wants to play lacrosse this season, but
you’re not sure how to go about teaching him or her the game.
 You aren’t interested in coaching lacrosse in the high-school or collegiate
ranks any time soon.
2
Coaching Lacrosse For Dummies 

 You want to know how to interact with the kids and their parents, what
to do at the first practice of the season, and how to figure out who 
plays where.
If any of these descriptions hits the mark, you’ve come to the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, and each part pertains to a specific aspect 
of coaching a youth lacrosse team. The following sections give you a quick
rundown.
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse
The preparations you make before you ever get near the lacrosse field make 
a big difference on what happens when you’re on it with your team. This part
presents everything you need to know to get the season off to a fun-filled
start and keep the smiles going all season long. You discover how to create a
coaching philosophy that ties into the kids’ needs and how to run a success-
ful preseason parents’ meeting. You also discover all the key rules and terms
that you and your players need to know so that everyone has a well-rounded
understanding of lacrosse.
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team
Coaching a youth lacrosse team is richly rewarding for many reasons: inter-
acting with your players at practice, helping them develop an array of offen-
sive and defensive skills, and seeing the excitement in their eyes as they take
the field on game day, among others. But before you take the field to run
those practices and coach those games, you need to answer some questions,
such as the following:
 How do I determine who plays where?
 How do I plan fun, safe practices that match my players’ skill levels?
 How can I help all the kids — from the uncoordinated to the super-
talented — learn and develop skills?
 What do I say to my players before a game to get them ready?
 What is the best approach for motivating kids during games, especially
when they are really struggling?
 How can I be sure I’m getting the most out of my time with the players 
at practice?
3
Introduction

 What can I do to teach my players how to be good sports at all times,
whether they’ve won or lost the game?
You find the answers to these questions — and many others that are sure to
be swirling around in your head — in Part II.
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching 
Lacrosse Skills
Showing kids how to cradle, pass, catch, shoot, and defend — the basic ele-
ments of lacrosse — is a huge slice of the coaching pie. This part presents
these important fundamental skills. The better your players can perform
these skills, the more satisfying their playing experience will be. We cover all
the basics you need to know when your team is on the attack, as well as the
skills that come in handy when your team doesn’t have the ball and is trying
to prevent the opposition from scoring.
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced 
Lacrosse Coaching
As your players get a firmer grasp on the basics of the game, you have to
make adjustments in your coaching to keep pace. This section has you cov-
ered, beginning with evaluating your players’ development, setting goals, and
exploring different ways to help your players reach those goals. We also
introduce a wide array of drills that you can slip into your practices to help
players continue progressing in the sport, and we offer some advanced
strategies for excelling both offensively and defensively.
Part V: The Extra Points
We hope that you won’t have to spend any time this season dealing with
injuries or discipline problems with your players — or their parents — but 
if any issues arise, this part offers some valuable input for handling them. 
We address how to help keep your players healthy and reduce the chances 
of injuries; we also include some tips on pregame and postgame nutrition
that you can share with your team. If you encounter any problems with par-
ents, coaches, or your own players, we’ve got you covered on the best ways
to deal with them, and if you have any aspirations to coach a travel lacrosse
team, you get the scoop on how to make the transition to this more-advanced
level of play.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
A fixture of all For Dummies books is the Part of Tens. Here, we present ten
qualities of all good lacrosse players, ten ways to prepare your team for a
game, and ten tips to help your goaltenders excel.

them and hold fun, action-packed practices, Part II is what you need. If you
want specific drills for your practices, Chapters 7 and 14 meet your needs.
Before you proceed any further, note that you can find answers to your most
pressing questions quickly by checking out the table of contents or index —
tools that point you in the direction you want to go.
Whatever approach you take, sit back, relax, and soak up the information
that will help you coach your team through a safe, enjoyable, and rewarding
lacrosse season.

G
etting your season headed in the right direction
really begins with the preparation you put in before
conducting that ﬁrst practice of the season. Deﬁning your
coaching philosophy, understanding the rules of the game
and any modiﬁcations your league has made, and running
a productive preseason parents’ meeting all affect how
enjoyable the season is for everyone involved. You can

Chapter 1
Teaching Lacrosse to Children
In This Chapter
 Preparing to coach lacrosse
 Taking the field with your team
 Coaching your own child
 Dealing with problems
C
ongratulations on stepping forward to coach a youth lacrosse team this
season! Few endeavors are more rewarding than working with children
and helping them develop skills, as well as grow as individuals. If you happen
to be picking up this book because you haven’t decided yet whether you want
the job, we hope that the information we present here convinces you that
coaching can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life — as long
as you do it for the right reasons. Heading into the season, your goals should
center on fun, skill development, and safety.
A volunteer lacrosse coach assumes a very important role. The way you
approach the season, interact with the kids, and get along with their parents
goes a long way toward determining whether your players embrace the sport
and play it for years to come or put away their sticks for good.
To get your season headed in the right direction and finish it strong, you
simply need some quality information, which begins here and runs through-
out the book. In the following pages, you find everything you need to propel
your players through a safe, fun-filled season that they’ll remember fondly 
for years to come.
Recognizing Your Behind-the-
Scenes Responsibilities
Before you go on a job interview, you research the company to find out
everything you can to help you land the position. The same approach applies
to coaching lacrosse. Before your players strap on their helmets and take the

field, you have to fulfill lots of behind-the-scenes responsibilities to get the
season off to a smooth start. So whatever your reasons for volunteering —
simply because your daughter is on the team, or because you love lacrosse
and want to share your knowledge and enthusiasm with others — be aware
that you’ve accepted an enormous responsibility that you should never 
take lightly.
Working with your players’ parents
One of the most interesting aspects of coaching youth lacrosse — and also
one of the most challenging — is working with the players’ parents. Most of
the parents you’ll come into contact with are wonderful, supportive, caring
people who naturally want the best for their kids; they may even turn out to
be great assets to you as assistant coaches. (Check out Chapter 4 for details
on choosing assistants.)
But any time you’re dealing with a group of adults in an organized sports set-
ting, of course, some of them can end up being sources of season-long aggra-
vation. If you’re not prepared to handle situations involving parents quickly
and efficiently, some parents can become distractions and can detract from
the kids’ enjoyment. They can also have you reaching for the aspirin bottle.
Teaming up with parents
Just as you can dodge an opponent on the lacrosse field, you can sidestep
many potential parent problems by gathering all the parents together before
you begin working with their kids, laying the ground rules on what you
expect in terms of behavior during games, and outlining parental roles and
responsibilities. Turn to Chapter 4 for details on how to conduct one of these
parent meetings.
Throughout the season, you’ll be stressing to your players the importance of
teamwork. You really won’t do anything different when it comes to the par-
ents. When coaches and parents find ways to work together — the adult form
of teamwork — they create a special atmosphere that produces tremendous
benefits for everyone, especially the youngsters. Conversely, when coaches
and parents clash on everything from playing-time issues to the positioning
of players to game-day strategy, they spoil the lacrosse experience for every-
one involved. These types of disagreements smother the kids’ fun, turning
practices and games into activities that they dread instead of look forward to.
Parents play important roles in youth lacrosse programs. Working with them,
rather than against them, can have a positive impact on the season.
Keeping parents involved
Keep the following in mind to make your dealings with parents go smoothly:
10
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

 Take a proactive approach. Before that first face-off drill in practice, let
parents know what your expectations are — not just for their kids, but
for them as well. Explain your coaching methods to them. Detail what
you want both players and parents to take away from their experience.
Painting a clear picture leaves little room for those dreaded misunder-
standings that often develop into major problems.
This season may be some parents’ first experience having a child in an
organized sports program, so any information you can share to help
them navigate this unfamiliar territory will be greatly appreciated.
Telling parents firsthand that you’re committed to skill development over
winning and that you adhere to the league’s equal-playing-time rule helps
reduce the chance that a parent will confront you in the middle of the
season about how many minutes Junior is receiving on the field on game
day. Failing to clarify these issues for parents well in advance opens the
door to more problems than you can ever imagine — and you’ll get them,
too. Chapter 2 helps you develop that all-important coaching philosophy
and understand all your league’s policies and rules so that you can 
communicate this information clearly to parents.
 Find different ways to include them. Parents invest a lot of time in the
season by driving their kids to practices and games; they also fork over 
a lot of money to purchase equipment, uniforms, and even occasional
postgame treats for the team. The season will be much more enjoyable for
them and their youngsters — and you’ll be making a wonderful gesture —
if you find ways to include them in the team’s season-long journey. Get
parents involved at practices, for example, and recruit the right ones to
assist on game day. Chapter 4 gives you a variety of tips on boosting
parental involvement.
 Keep communication lines open. Conducting a preseason parents’
meeting (covered in Chapter 4) is the first step toward establishing a
strong foundation with your players’ parents, but you’ve got to keep
communication lines open all season long. Be sure to find time at differ-
ent junctures during the season to talk to the parents about their chil-
dren’s progress. Parents enjoy hearing about those areas of the game in
which their child is really excelling. Also, any time a child encounters
some difficulty in picking up a skill you are teaching in practice, suggest
something the parents can do to help their child at home — but only if
the youngster is interested. You never want to force a player to practice
more at home if he or she isn’t enthusiastic about it.
You can check in with parents from time to time by having a quick casual
chat before or after practice, just to make sure that everything is going
well and that their child is having fun playing for you. Including parents
in all facets of the season is the right thing to do, the smart thing to do,
and one of the most effective ways to ensure that children have a positive
experience playing lacrosse.
11
Chapter 1: Teaching Lacrosse to Children

Regardless of what you do to include parents and make them feel that they’re
valuable parts of the season, a problem may still arise. No matter what the
nature of the issue is, you must remain grounded, calm, and in control of your
emotions. In Chapter 18, we cover some of the most common problems that
lacrosse coaches are forced to address and offer the best approaches for
solving them before they have a chance to affect the season.
Getting a handle on rules and terms
It’s no secret that teaching your players offensive and defensive skills is one
of your biggest responsibilities as a lacrosse coach, but it’s certainly not your
only one. You also must go over other aspects of the game that will impact
the kids’ enjoyment level. The more you know and understand about the
game — rules, terms, and (at the advanced levels) strategy — and the better
you can explain them to your team, the more enjoyable the experience will be
for them and for you. The process isn’t as complicated as it may seem, but
you need to put in some time and effort to learn the rules, including some of
the stranger ones that you may not be familiar with — such as the proper
way to execute a check (in some boys’ leagues) without being whistled for a
penalty or how many players you are allowed to have across the midfield line
when your team has the ball and is on the attack.
In Chapter 3, we open the rule book and describe everything from terminology
to penalties. Throughout Parts II, III, and IV, we also focus on providing you a
detailed rundown of the skills, techniques, and strategies that you need to pass
on to your players. We’ve got you covered if you need a refresher on some of
the fundamental skills to teach a beginning team, and we provide more-detailed
information if you’re coaching an older squad that has been attacking and
defending for several seasons.
Often, leagues modify rules to fit players’ ages and experience levels, and 
you need to be aware of all these changes so that you can alert your players.
Everything from the size of the field to what types of rules are enforced
changes from community to community. Knowing these rules — and being
able to share them — makes a tremendous difference in your players’ 
enjoyment of playing lacrosse.
Stepping onto the Field
Seeing kids running up and down the field with smiles on their faces, watch-
ing them learn new skills and improve on others, and observing them as they
develop a love of lacrosse make all those hours you volunteer worthwhile.
During your time with the kids, both in practices and on game day, what 
12
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

you say to them and how you go about saying it have a significant impact 
on their experience. Based on your interactions with your players, you wield
the power to fuel their passion for playing the game or drive them away in
disappointment.
Planning and executing practices
Game day is what young lacrosse players look forward to most, but the bulk
of their skill development takes place during practices, so you need to design
quality practices and use drills that meet all the kids’ needs and allow them
to see improvement in their play. Well-planned practices pay big dividends in
fun and player development, whereas those that are simply thrown together
in a couple of minutes squash the team’s potential.
To make each practice productive, keep the following tips in mind:
 Use your position to shape lives. Be aware that your impact on your
players’ lives can extend far beyond showing them how to execute vari-
ous offensive and defensive skills. Your position allows you to make a 
significant difference in many other areas, and you should take full advan-
tage of the opportunity. During practices, devote time to discussing the
importance of staying away from tobacco, alcohol, and drugs and the
ways they can harm the body. Stress the importance of players’ doing
their best in school so that they can lead productive lives as adults. Talk
about getting exercise and eating healthy food to help prevent future
health issues, too.
While the kids are stretching is a great time to talk about topics besides
lacrosse that can have a significant impact on their lives.
 Make the setting fun. The most effective practices are conducted in an
enjoyable atmosphere in which fun is emphasized and mistakes (such as
dropping a pass) aren’t viewed as catastrophic. Let the kids know at the
first practice of the season that mistakes are part of playing lacrosse and
that everyone will make them during the season. Be sure to get across to
them that all you ask is that they listen to your instructions and give
their all during practices and games. Kids who know that they can make
mistakes without being humiliated or yanked out of the game will be
much more relaxed on the field and will have much more fun. A relaxed
atmosphere also helps the kids pick up skills faster and learn more
aspects of the game.
 Be creative. When you’re putting together drills, look for clever ways to
enhance the fun. Visualize going through the drill, and ask yourself what
would make it more interesting. Challenge yourself to run practices that
the kids can’t wait to get to. You want your players to have so much fun
at practice that they hate it when the session comes to a close.
13
Chapter 1: Teaching Lacrosse to Children

When you’re putting together your practice plan, go with those drills that keep
the kids on the move and that match their skill level. Drills that force kids to
stand in line or spend more time watching than participating kill energy levels,
as well as sabotage learning, development, and that all-important fun factor. We
provide an array of drills that cover all areas of the game — and that are
designed for all skill levels — in Chapters 7 and 14.
Handling game-day duties
Coaching a youth lacrosse team on game day is all about being prepared,
adapting to ever-changing situations, and providing a constant source of posi-
tive motivation. You have to make a wide range of decisions, often with little
time to think about them and while juggling other issues. You have pregame,
halftime, and postgame talks to deliver; playing time to monitor; substitutions
to make; and strategies to employ. Yes, game day brings a lengthy list of
responsibilities, but you don’t need to lose any sleep over it. In Chapter 8, 
you find all you need to help your game day go smoothly so that you won’t
spend your nights tossing and turning.
Game day provides more than just an opportunity for your players to use the
skills they’ve been working on in practice. It also allows you to get across some
other important points, such as working as a team, displaying good sportsman-
ship toward opponents and officials, abiding by the rules, doing your best at all
times — and having fun regardless of the numbers on the scoreboard.
Juggling the Dual Roles 
of Coach and Parent
If you’re a parent, you certainly don’t need us to tell you that you already
have one of the most challenging jobs around. What we can share with you,
though, is that handling the dual role of parenting and coaching your child in
lacrosse can present unique challenges, some of which you may not expect.
When you and your child step onto the field, new issues can materialize;
preparing yourself to handle them can help pave the way to an enormously
rewarding and memorable season for both of you.
If you and your child agree that it’s a good move for you to coach the team,
rely on the following tips to help ensure that the experience is problem free:
 Put parenting first. Regardless of what happens on the field during a
practice or game, you’re a parent first and foremost. If the team per-
formed poorly, don’t monopolize your child’s time at home by dissecting
everything that unfolded. Leave the coaching at the field; focus on being 
a supportive, caring parent.
14
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

 Maintain open communication. Your child must understand that he can
come to you with a problem at any time, just as you want any of the
other players to do if something is on their minds. Just because you’re
the coach doesn’t mean that certain topics are off limits.
 Ditch the extra repetitions. Sometimes, your child may have difficulty
grasping a particular skill during practice or may struggle during a game.
The natural tendency is to work with her at home, giving her some extra
repetitions. This territory is dangerous, however, so proceed cautiously.
Refrain from pushing the child to practice more. It’s OK to ask casually
whether she’d like to spend a little extra time working on a certain skill
at home. If so, great; if not, let the situation go. Pushing your child to
perform extra repetitions can drain her interest in the sport and make
her feel inferior to some of her teammates.
 Chuck the comparisons. Never burden a child with expectations that he
should perform as well as his brothers or sisters who are involved in
lacrosse or who played it in the past. Let your child develop at his own
rate. Comparing kids can result in problems that are difficult to repair,
such as crushed confidence, low self esteem, and lack of interest in
future participation.
 Pile on the praise. Kids can have a tough time when their parent is a
coach, because they have to adjust to sharing Mom or Dad with a group
of other children, so be sure to praise your child’s willingness, under-
standing, and cooperation in this special venture. Coaching your child
can be one of the most rewarding experiences you’ll ever have, but it
isn’t always easy.
 Find the proper balance. Make sure that your behavior falls between pro-
viding preferential treatment and overcompensating to avert the percep-
tion that you’re giving your child special treatment. You want to be careful
that you don’t give your child extra playing time and attention without
even being aware of it. But you also want to exercise great caution that
you don’t go to unfair lengths to reduce your child’s playing time or give
her less attention or instruction during practices because you don’t want
other parents to think that you’re favoring your child.
As a parent, you naturally want your child to excel on the lacrosse field. 
Just don’t allow yourself to view your coaching position as an opportunity 
to control your child’s destiny and help secure a college scholarship for him.
Entering the season with those types of thoughts will likely lead you to put
unwanted pressure on the child and push him harder than you do the other
kids. If you lose sight of what youth lacrosse is all about, you may create
problems that affect not just his interest in lacrosse, but also his emotional
well being.

Chapter 1: Teaching Lacrosse to Children

Preparing for All Kinds of Obstacles
Being a youth lacrosse coach requires more than just the ability to teach
passing techniques and the proper way to scoop up a loose ball. It also takes
being prepared and knowing how to handle the many unique challenges that
have the potential to appear throughout the season. Following are two of
your greatest coaching challenges:
 Meeting the needs of all the players. Working with all the different types 
of kids you’ll find on your roster — ranging from the shy and clumsy to the
nonstop talkers and the athletically gifted — will keep you on your toes.
Sure, the smorgasbord of personalities will test your patience, communica-
tion skills, and ability to meet each player’s constantly changing needs, 
but you’re up to the task. To help you along, Chapter 13 offers some great
advice on refining your coaching strategies as the season unfolds to ensure
that each youngster gets the most out of her experience under your 
guidance.
 Maintaining a safe environment. One of your top priorities is keeping
the kids as safe as possible every time they take the field for practices
and games. Although protecting the players completely and eliminating
all types of injuries is impossible, you can take steps that significantly
reduce the risk of injuries, as well as their severity. You can accomplish
this goal by teaching only proper and safe techniques, being prepared for
emergency situations, and knowing how to handle any emergencies that
do take place. Chapter 17 provides tips and advice for keeping kids safe.
Any time you take the field for a practice or game, be sure to have a properly
stocked first-aid kit on hand. In Chapter 17, we cover what your kit should
include.

Setting the Stage for a 
Successful Season
In This Chapter
 Putting together your coaching philosophy
 Knowing your league inside and out
 Mapping out practices
 Equipping the kids
C
oaching a squad of young lacrosse players involves more than showing
up with a whistle, a list of drills, and a bag of balls. If you want to be one
of those coaches whom kids can’t wait to get to the field to play for and learn
from — and we know you do! — you have to do a lot of preparation before
greeting them at that first practice of the season. You have to examine why
you volunteered in the first place, determine your take on distributing play-
ing time, figure out what methods you’ll use to motivate players, and decide
on your plans to create a relaxed atmosphere that promotes learning and
skill development.
The league you’re coaching in also dictates a portion of your philosophy, so
finding out as much as you can about the league’s policies before you step on
the field is important. Being involved in a league that promotes values that
you want to impart to your team is critical for everyone’s enjoyment.
All these ingredients factor into your coaching philosophy. This chapter
grabs onto all those areas to help you mold a philosophy that meets the kids’
needs and sets the tone for a good season.

Developing a Lacrosse 
Coaching Philosophy
Coaching a lacrosse team requires thorough knowledge of the rules (see
Chapter 3), ability to teach the offensive and defensive fundamentals of the
game (see Chapters 9 and 10), and a well-crafted philosophy — something
that slips under the radar for many coaches preparing for a season. You’re
probably wondering what philosophy has to do with attacking and defending.
Don’t worry — putting together a philosophy that meets the kids’ needs is
not as difficult as it may sound. Heading into the season with a good plan in
place is as important to you as properly fitted equipment is to your players.
A coaching philosophy reflects the standards you set for yourself and your
team, and it represents the foundation of your coaching values and beliefs.
Entering the season without a coaching philosophy is like hiking in the woods
without a compass. Sure, you’ll probably manage to get where you want to
go, but the experience may not be quite as enjoyable. A well-thought-out
coaching philosophy keeps you on the right track as you navigate the season.
In this section, we introduce the various components to consider in developing
a philosophy that stresses respect, sportsmanship, skill development, safety,
and fun.
Even when you have a well-designed philosophy firmly in place, sticking to 
it on game days can present all sorts of new challenges. You’ll deal with
Cameron’s mom asking why the team isn’t in first place and with Sandy’s dad
inquiring why his daughter isn’t playing goalie all game long, because she’s
clearly the team’s most skilled player in that position. (Explaining your coach-
ing philosophy to parents before the season gets under way helps you steer
clear of many of these potential headaches. See Chapter 4 for details.)
Your coaching philosophy says a lot about you — not just as a coach, but
also as a person — so take the time to put some real thought into it. You’ll be
glad you did, and your players will be the beneficiaries. Lead your players 
in the direction you know is right. Strive to instill in them the values that 
you want your own kids (if you have any) to exhibit throughout their lives.
Accomplish this goal, and regardless of how many games you win this
season, you and your team will be winners in the truest sense. That’s what
coaching youth lacrosse is really all about.
Tailoring your philosophy to age group
The kids you’ll coach will be quite different. Some are great attackers; others
excel at defense; and some kids struggle to grasp some of the most basic ele-
ments of the game, such as scooping up the ball and running with it.
18
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Regardless of the areas of the game that they excel in or struggle with, young-
sters possess general characteristics that are influenced by age. Children are
continually growing and evolving, and part of your coaching responsibility is to
know and understand what to expect — both physically and emotionally —
from them at various age levels.
Being fully aware of the general age-related differences we cover in the follow-
ing sections can enhance your coaching skills and your effectiveness in relating
to your team. It can also ensure that you don’t favor the players who are more
mature and skilled at the expense of players whose skills are less developed at
this point in their young careers.
No matter what the age or skill level of your players, always be supportive and
enthusiastic. Pile on the praise, and never stop encouraging them, whether
they’re playing in a midweek practice drill or the final minutes of a tied game.
This approach builds players’ confidence and self-esteem. Whether they’re 6 or
16, encouragement is a gift that can last for years to come and affect how they
approach life away from the lacrosse field.
Ages 6 and younger
Most of the children in this age bracket have probably never played lacrosse
before, and this season may very well be their first experience in any type of
organized team setting. Your job is simply to introduce them to some of the
most basic elements of lacrosse and make the game enjoyable so that they’ll
be eager to return next season. (Chapters 9 and 10 cover the fundamentals
that you can focus on with this age group.)
Most lacrosse programs at this level rarely bother to keep score of games,
because competition usually is the farthest thing from these kids’ minds. The
same can’t be said for all parents, some of whom may be a little too concerned
about which team is scoring more goals. (For more on dealing with problem
parents, check out Chapter 18.) At this level, most kids generally couldn’t care
less about how their lacrosse skills stack up to their teammates’. They’re
interested primarily in being with friends, having fun learning, and playing 
the sport.
When meeting with the opposing coach before games, encourage him to pro-
vide positive feedback to your players when the action is near him, and let
him know that you’ll do the same when the play takes place near you. At this
level, you just want kids running around the field, getting a feel for running
with the ball and passing and catching it.
Ages 7–9
In this age range, youngsters usually have played a season or two. They may
begin expressing interest in learning more about the sport and the skills
required to play it. (Head to Chapters 15 and 16 for some advanced techniques
you can concentrate on.)
19
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

These kids crave feedback from coaches and parents on how they’re perform-
ing certain skills and how they’re progressing with new ones. This age is when
they start paying closer attention to their teammates’ abilities and comparing
their own skills.
Ages 10–12
Most kids in this age bracket have had a few seasons of lacrosse experience.
They’re back on the field to play for you because they really enjoy the game
or have discovered that they’re pretty good at it. Your job is to keep the posi-
tive momentum going by adding to their foundation of skills so that they 
can become more well-rounded players and see improvement in their skills.
Making sure that practices meet your players’ skill level, as well as feature
lots of fun, is important. (For more details on crafting quality practices, check
out Chapter 6.)
Quite often, sports take on added importance at this juncture in kids’ lives,
and some of your players really want to do well. As children reach this age
bracket, many of them become more competitive; their performance, as well
as their team’s, takes on more importance. They talk with friends and family
members about how their team is doing — especially if their team’s win–loss
record features more victories than defeats.
Many of these kids begin embracing the challenge of putting their skills against
those of others their age. When they’re able to help their team prevail, these
players feel immense satisfaction, accompanied by a unique feeling of 
accomplishment that’s specific to competing on the lacrosse field.
Ages 13–14
You are entering the challenging world of the teenager! These kids have
developed many of the basic skills needed to play lacrosse and now want to
improve them. (Chapter 14 introduces more advanced drills for older kids
and provides an assortment of challenging drills.)
Be aware that children at this age are adjusting to their ever-changing bodies,
as well as trying to figure out who they are. One of the best ways to make a
difference with them is to get to know them on a personal level. Ask them
who their favorite athletes or teams are, for example. This tip is great for
building special coach–player bonds with kids of all ages. See “Keeping 
communication lines open,” later in this chapter.
Ages 15 and older
Securing your players’ respect and maintaining it are important for realizing
coaching success and minimizing disciplinary problems. Players in this age
range have developed a real passion for the sport. Many of them attend
lacrosse camps; perhaps they lift weights and run to stay in top condition. In
some cases, they may even know more about some areas of the sport than
you do.
20
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

If you get talked into coaching players in this age range, or step forward to
volunteer because the league is experiencing a shortage of coaches, don’t
lose any sleep over the move. Instead, welcome the chance to enhance your
coaching abilities, and embrace the opportunity to coach these kids, who
have a deep-rooted love for the game. Be sure to let them know that you
value their opinions, suggestions, and input regarding the team. Youngsters’
passion for lacrosse is great to see, and coaching kids who care so much
about the sport is lots of fun. You’ll find that their enthusiasm helps make
your job easier.
Emphasizing teamwork
Playing lacrosse requires the entire team to work as a cohesive unit. If even a
couple of players aren’t on board with the team concept (for more on dealing
with ball hogs, flip to Chapter 5), the team chemistry can be spoiled, and
everyone’s enjoyment of the season will be slightly negated. One of the many
unique aspects of lacrosse is that players have opportunities to create plays on
their own — such as attackers breaking past a defender and racing downfield.
Individual plays are fine, as long as they’re carried out within the framework 
of the team concept and the player uses the advantage to create a scoring 
opportunity for the team rather than simply to hold on to the ball.
Uncovering the best methods to instill teamwork among your players is one
of the most challenging tasks you may encounter as a coach. Focus on getting
your players to see the enormous benefits of working as a team (rather than
as a bunch of individuals) through the following pointers, and you’ll mold a
team that opponents hate facing because of its team-oriented style of play:
 Point out positive team play. During practices, try to recognize team
effort more often than you single out individual play. If you’re conducting
a three-on-three drill, for example, and the offensive unit scores a goal,
you may have a natural tendency to applaud the player who deposited the
ball in the net. But as a coach who emphasizes teamwork, you may be
able to trace the success of the play back to the person who made a nice
pass that gave the goal scorer a great opportunity. Recognize all the com-
ponents that went into making a play work, and your players who were
involved in the process will feel as much pride and satisfaction as the goal
scorer does.
When you spread praise among all the kids who played a part in scoring
a goal, they begin to understand that every one of them fills a very
important role on the team.
 Promote peer praise. Sure, kids love hearing your words of praise, but
what their teammates say packs just as much punch (and even more at
times). Encourage the kids who score goals to acknowledge the team-
mates who provided them the opportunity to take quality shots. Getting
21
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

kids into the habit of giving high fives or saying “Great pass” or “Nice
play” forges bonds and strengthens team unity — and also makes the
kids want to play harder for one another.
 Shoot for sideline support. On game days, encourage players who aren’t
on the field to stay involved in the action by cheering and supporting their
teammates. Hearing teammates’ cheers also provides extra encourage-
ment for the players on the field and can do wonders for a player’s tired
legs or sagging confidence.
 Give kids chances to make plays on their own. Yes, lacrosse is a team
sport, but you shouldn’t stamp out kids’ abilities to create plays on their
own to benefit the team. During the game, your attackers should be able
to make some one-on-one moves to create space for themselves to take
a shot or deliver a pass to an open teammate. Individual play becomes a
problem only when that player ignores teammates because he wants to
try to do everything himself.
 Spread the captain’s role around. Don’t rely on two or three players to
serve as team captains throughout the season, because captaincy ele-
vates them above the rest of the squad. Instead, give every player the
opportunity to lead warm-ups in practice during the season or on game
day. This practice infuses the team with the sense that all players are
equal parts of the group.
In most youth lacrosse programs, captains usually aren’t required until
around the age of 14 or on travel teams (see Chapter 19), when the com-
petition becomes more intense and the players are more experienced. At
younger age levels, captains aren’t necessary during games, but you can
use them to your advantage as another way to build kids’ self-esteem
and to make them feel valued and appreciated — as long as you make
sure you give every child the chance to be a captain at some point
during the season.
 Recognize hustle plays after the game. The kids who scored the goals
during the game don’t need as much additional praise afterward, because
their shots generated cheers and applause from the spectators, as well as
high fives from their teammates. Use your time following the game to
congratulate the player who delivered the cross-field pass that caught
the defense off guard and led to the scoring opportunity, or the player
who didn’t register a goal but hustled all game long and chased down
several ground balls that gave your team a few extra offensive posses-
sions. Recognizing these plays and the kids who made them reinforces
the fact that wins, losses, and even goals are never the work of one
player, but of the entire team.
Motivating players
Regardless of age, ability, or experience playing lacrosse, each player arrives
at the field with vastly different motivations for playing the game. Some kids
22
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

are there to try something new; some are there because they love the game;
some come because Mom and Dad think that lacrosse is the perfect sport for
them. A few of the kids are strongly motivated — the type who push them-
selves to succeed and are awfully hard on themselves when they don’t fulfill
their own lofty expectations. Others rely on your words of encouragement to
improve and excel.
You’ll discover that some of your players respond in a positive manner to your
challenges, such as seeing whether they can make five accurate passes in a row
to a partner during a passing drill. For others, challenge-oriented tasks may
turn out to be too much pressure to deal with and may actually detract from
their motivation to participate. Each youngster you come into contact with is
remarkably different from the others, and you have to discover for yourself
what works for a child to get the best out of her as both a lacrosse player and 
a person.
Here are a few general tips you can employ to help ignite passion in your
players and motivate them to strive to become the best they can be:
 Enthusiasm is contagious. When you have a sincere passion for lacrosse
and want to share this great game and all its wonderful components with
children, your genuine excitement and enthusiasm will rub off on the
team, and they’ll respond accordingly.
 Set goals that kids can get their hands on. Setting unrealistic goals for
kids — such as winning every game or scoring a specific number of goals
each game — is unrealistic, unfair, and unlikely to produce the results
you are aiming to achieve. Keep in mind that your players are children,
some of whom may never have played lacrosse before. Keep your expec-
tations reasonable for the kids you’re coaching, and set goals that are
within their reach. You stimulate and encourage them to keep working
when the goals are within sight.
If a child senses that your expectations are impossibly far-fetched, he
wonders what’s the point of even trying, and his play on the field suffers.
This problem negatively affects the entire team.
You want to teach winning, but be sure to define a winner as someone
who always gives her best effort, regardless of the score in the game.
 Make a big deal out of the positives. Some coaches tend to raise their
voices or make a big scene when the team makes a mistake or performs a
skill the wrong way. Take the reverse approach instead. Stop practice for
a moment to point out when the team does something really well, such as
executing a fast break or denying one. Or, if a player who has been strug-
gling with a specific skill performs it the right way you can use this tech-
nique to boost his confidence and self-esteem. Being positive is simply
one of the best motivational tools around.
Think about it: If your boss tells you in front of your co-workers that you
did a great job on a presentation, you’re going to give even more effort on
your next presentation. The same goes for kids on the lacrosse field. If 
23
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

you halt practice for even 20 seconds to praise good performance, the
mini break can make a youngster’s day. Also, the benefits will carry over
beyond that practice. Just watch — he’ll play that position with pride and
continue giving you his best effort to try to gain that recognition again.
Ditch the threats and any motivation-through-fear tactics, because they have
no place in youth lacrosse. Making kids run laps for failing to perform at an
expected level has no place in the game. This type of coaching approach
handcuffs a youngster’s ability to perform, because she’s afraid of making
another mistake that’s going to translate into additional punishment. Children
have to feel free to make mistakes to improve. Also, relying on these tactics
will likely chase kids away from participating in the future. Children are there
to develop and to learn from their mistakes, not to be humiliated or punished
for them.
Creating a positive atmosphere
The more relaxed and comfortable kids are playing for you, the more satisfy-
ing the experience will be for them — and the better the chance that they’ll
be effective on the field. Here are a couple of ways you can generate an
atmosphere that promotes team spirit, encourages participation, and
rewards the ideal of doing your best at all times.
 Create a team cheer. Work with the kids to come up with a clever team
cheer to use before games. This cheer should remind them that they’re
taking the field as a team and must work together to play at their 
highest level.
 Cheer mistakes. Even making a mistake or failing to perform a particular
skill the way you demonstrated it is part of playing and learning how to
play lacrosse, and kids need constant reminders of that fact. Praising a
player’s effort for doing his best, rather than criticizing mistakes, frees
the child to continue putting forth maximum effort until he gets a handle
on the particular skill. Taking this approach opens the door to all sorts
of learning; players aren’t going to fear making a mistake when they
know you won’t make negative comments.
Keeping communication lines open
Coaching lacrosse is more than just teaching kids how to cradle or how to exe-
cute a stick check. You are in a special position to affect other areas of their
lives — but only if your players feel comfortable enough talking to you about
subjects unrelated to the game. You want to establish from the beginning that
they can come to you with questions, problems, or concerns at any point.
24
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Besides being their coach, you can be their friend. While they’re stretching,
for example, ask them how they’re doing in school, what their favorite sub-
jects are, or who their favorite teacher is. Find out whether they have any
brothers or sisters, the names of their pets, and what hobbies they enjoy.
Getting to know kids on a more personal level lets them know you care about
them as individuals and makes it much easier for them to open up to you if
they ever need to — which is more important than any offensive or defensive
technique you can teach them.
Making all the kids count
Every player who grabs a lacrosse stick or straps on a helmet should feel
valued and appreciated. To make this feeling happen, you must pay close
attention to all your players, regardless of how talented they are. Sure, paying
attention to everyone sounds easy, but that’s not always the case. After all,
becoming enamored with the most athletically gifted kids can lead you to
shower them with all the attention, accolades, and praise.
Spreading the encouraging words around equally takes real focus and effort.
Making sure that each child — no matter how big or small her actual contri-
butions are during games and practices — feels valued and appreciated for
her efforts is the cornerstone of good coaching. Appreciation is what helps
keep kids interested in lacrosse and eager to keep returning to the field.
Providing immediate feedback and continually recognizing all players for
their various contributions are the most effective ways to boost your players’
self-confidence and fuel their interest in giving their best efforts all season
long. Consider these points:
 Acknowledge all on-the-field contributions. Although the kids who score
the goals tend to receive the most praise, don’t overlook the contributions
of the other players. On a goal-scoring play, for example, recognize the
defender who made the steal that led to the goal-generating possession;
also recognize the kids who made the passes that set up the player who
scored. Getting into this habit goes a long way toward making each child
feel truly appreciated and part of the team.
 Applaud attitudes (just the good ones!). Some players aren’t the best
attackers, or they struggle to stop opponents on defense. Yet even the
less-skilled kids can be recognized for their contributions, however big or
small. You can applaud his hustle in running down the field to get back
into defensive position, the effort she put forth to battle for a loose ball,
or the good sportsmanship he displayed in congratulating an opponent
for a well-played game.
25
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

 Hand out hardware. Many coaches enjoy handing out awards to their
players at the end of the season. If you elect to do so, make sure that
you come up with something for every player instead of taking the old
Most Valuable Player route. Awards you can distribute include Hardest
Worker in Practice, Best Display of Sportsmanship, and Most Likely to
Win a Battle for a Ground Ball. (See Chapter 4 for suggestions on how 
to reward your players at the end of the season.)
Spotlighting fun and skill development
Don’t view your team’s win–loss record as a measure of how good a coach
you are. The real tally of your impact is the smiles on the kids’ faces, the
skills they learn, and the improvements they make along the way. At the more
advanced levels of play, winning takes on a more prominent role, and that
concept shouldn’t be swept aside, because it’s part of playing lacrosse. But
fun and fair play shouldn’t take a back seat while you do your best to achieve
victories.
Children are highly impressionable. If they get a sense that winning is all that
really matters to you, fun and developing skills will become secondary in
their minds, and getting everything back on track becomes difficult. The
younger and less experienced your players are, the less you should focus on
wins and losses, and the more you should concentrate on teaching skills and
ensuring that everyone has fun playing and learning.
Children’s short attention spans can make coaching difficult at times but can
also work to your advantage. Many youngsters just beginning in the sport
usually forget the score of the last game quickly and direct their attention to
something else. So even if the team happened to lose a game by several
goals, praise your players for their efforts.
Never let scoreboards or opposing teams define how much fun you have on
the lacrosse field or impede your team’s progress in learning the game. Just
because your players outscored their opponents doesn’t necessarily mean
that they performed to the best of their abilities. A squad can put forth a 
lackluster effort and still come out ahead because the opposing team played
poorly or simply didn’t have as many talented players. Conversely, your team
can play extremely well and still lose the contest. Whatever the case, push
the score to the side and take a close look at how your players performed,
and make the necessary adjustments on areas of the game you need to work
on at your next practice.
26

Modeling good sportsmanship
Teaching kids how to hold the stick to catch a pass or take a shot is impor-
tant for their development as offensive players. Teaching them to being good
sports — win or lose — is important for their personal growth. Good sports-
manship is one of the healthiest and most important ideals you can instill in
your players.
Here are a few ways you can help make your squad one of the best-liked and
most-respected teams in the league:
 Talk about sportsmanship all the time. The more time you spend talk-
ing about being good sports, the better chance your message has of
sinking in. Reinforcing the importance of sportsmanship every chance
you get goes a long way toward building model players.
 Set a positive tone on game day. Greeting the opposing coach and offi-
cials with a friendly handshake before the game helps set the tone for a
fun day of lacrosse. Remember, being a good sport isn’t a sign of weak-
ness or an indication that you don’t care about winning the game. It
shows that you’re a caring coach who respects the game.
 Display good behavior at all times. If you aren’t a model of good sports-
manship, you can’t expect your players to be good sports themselves.
Players are going to take their cue from you, so if you rant and rave to an
official about a call, expecting your team to show respect toward them is
hardly fair. Good coaching behavior means not yelling at officials or
questioning calls that you’re sure should have gone your team’s way.
 Recognize good sportsmanship. Continually recognizing displays of
good sportsmanship reinforces to players that how they behave during
and after games really is important.
 Always shake hands with opponents after the game. Regardless of the
game’s outcome, you always want your players lining up to shake hands
with the opposing team’s players and coaches. If your team won, your
players should be acknowledging that their opponents played a good
game, and if they lost, they should congratulate the opponents on their
victory. Your players will make an especially classy move if they also
shake the referee’s hand after the contest.
During the season, you may encounter a win-at-all-costs coach who prowls
the sidelines yelling and berating his team. Or you may see an out-of-control
parent who spends the entire game shouting instructions at his child or
argues every call that doesn’t go his way. Chapter 18 presents tips for han-
dling this type of inappropriate behavior, which has no place in youth
lacrosse.

Understanding the League 
You’re Coaching In
Youth lacrosse programs are as different as all the children who show up at
fields around the country to shoot, pass, and catch the ball. You can find reg-
ulation leagues that stick to the official rules of the game (see Chapter 3 for a
rundown of basic rules), as well as leagues that tweak the number of players
on the field and modify the rule book to fit the community’s needs.
In the following sections, I discuss some of the common differences between
boys’ and girls’ lacrosse, the importance of knowing your league’s rules, and
the differences between recreational and competitive programs.
Coaching girls’ leagues vs. boys’ leagues
The most noticeable difference between boys’ and girls’ lacrosse is the
amount of contact that is allowed, so you’ll have to adjust your coaching and
some of the skills you teach accordingly.
Body checking is allowed at certain levels of play in boys’ lacrosse — and not
allowed at all for girls. Body checking is permitted when the opponent has
the ball or is within 5 yards of the ball. All contact must occur from the front
or side, as well as below the shoulders and above the waist.
During your practices for a boys’ team you’ll want to incorporate drills that
focus on executing both body and stick checks when defending an attacking
player. Since different types of contact are allowed when defending, your play-
ers can take a more aggressive approach to deny passes and good scoring
opportunities. Offensively, your players will also need to know how to best
protect the ball when the defender delivers a body check or makes contact
with their sticks in an effort to knock the ball loose.
If you’re coaching a girls’ team, teaching them the importance of playing
good defense will involve an emphasis on good footwork and maintaining
proper position at all times. Since body contact isn’t allowed, your defenders
will need to have a good grasp of how to stay in front of the players they’re
guarding. Also, being able to read plays that are developing and recognizing
when passes are being made, as well as being able to step into passing lanes
to deflect or intercept an opponent’s pass, are key elements.

Knowing your league’s rules
A lacrosse rule book isn’t exactly going to have you turning pages in anticipa-
tion, like a best-selling novel, but it should be bedside reading for you — and
we don’t mean as a sleep aid! To be successful as a lacrosse coach, you have
to know the standard rules of the game, as well as any that have been modi-
fied by your league. You also must be able to teach the rules to your players;
otherwise, you’re setting them up for a frustrating experience.
Rather than plunging in and attempting to memorize all the rules in a single
sitting, review a few pages every night before the season’s start until you’re
comfortable with them. (For a quick primer on the rules of lacrosse — and
some modifications that youth leagues often make — check out Chapter 3.)
Don’t assume that older kids have a firm grasp on all the rules simply
because they’ve played the sport for years. If no one took the time to explain
certain rules that may be somewhat confusing, players may not have learned
them. You can make a difference. Also, more rules are typically enforced at
the higher levels of play.
Even if you have extensive knowledge of lacrosse, and maybe even if you
were a pretty good high school or college player, do yourself and your team a
big favor: Read the league’s rule book. Consider it a refresher course before
you take the field. Besides, chances are good that some of the league’s rules
were never applied the same way when you played.
Playing for fun or first place
Two distinct classifications exist in youth lacrosse: recreational and competi-
tive programs. Each type requires a vastly different approach to coaching.
Before agreeing to volunteer, you should check with the recreation director
to learn more about the league and make sure that it’s the right fit for you.
Recreational leagues
If you’re coaching lacrosse for the first time this season, chances are good
that you’re involved in a recreational league. These programs focus on teach-
ing kids the basic skills of the game. Generally, a recreational program has
rules in place regarding equal playing time, which makes your job easier,
because all the kids get a fair chance to play a variety of positions.
Often, for kids ages 10 and younger, the league scales teams down and has
them play games on smaller fields to allow each child plenty of chances to
run, catch, and shoot the ball. Recreational leagues also feature rules that
have been altered to meet the players’ ages and experience levels. Some
recreational programs allow the coaches of the youngest kids to be on the
field with them during games, for example.
29
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

Competitive leagues
Children whose thirst for competition can’t be quenched in their local recre-
ational programs can turn to the avalanche of competitive programs. These
leagues are typically referred to as travel teams, which Chapter 19 discusses
in greater detail.
This type of program is for youngsters who have demonstrated higher skill
levels than many other kids their age. These elite programs give kids the
chance to compete against others of similar ability in their state or region.
Usually, kids involved in these programs have their eye on long-term advance-
ment in the sport, such as playing at the collegiate level. (Or, as is often the
case, their parents are thinking about college scholarships and have pushed
the children into this highly competitive environment.)
If you’re coaching in a highly competitive league that you don’t believe you’re
adequately prepared for, notify the league director immediately. Let her know
that in the best interests of the kids, you prefer to coach a less experienced
team in a less competitive league. Do what you’re suited for at this time in your
volunteer coaching career. Down the road, if you choose to go the travel-team
coaching route, you’ll be well prepared to do so after a couple of seasons of
recreational coaching.
Getting on Schedule
A youth lacrosse coach’s handy companion for the season is his schedule,
which lets him know the dates and times for both practices and games. When
you sign up to coach a team, you typically receive a schedule for the season. 
In some leagues, arranging practices is up to you; other leagues take care of
scheduling practices for you, assigning specific times and fields to your players
(every Tuesday from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Field B, for example).
You also need to be aware of your league’s policies for handling make-up
games. Read on to get the scoop on these areas.
Scheduling team practices
Your players’ age group generally dictates how much time you’ll get to spend
conducting practices for them during the season. Most beginner leagues, for
example, generally have just one practice during the week and a game on the
weekend. Many leagues restrict the number of practices a coach can hold
during the season, so be aware of this rule before you put together your 
practice plans.
30
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Quite often, leagues set the practice schedule for the entire season based on
the number of fields that are available and what other programs are going on,
which eliminates a lot of scheduling headaches on your part.
The time you spend with your team during practice sessions is critical.
Practice isn’t a social hour. Neither is it a matter of lining some kids up on
offense and others on defense, and having them scrimmage for an hour while
you watch from the sidelines. You have to plan these sessions carefully and
be actively involved in them at all times. Chapter 6 features some in-depth
tips on running great practices.
Dealing with make-up games
Some days, Mother Nature just isn’t going to be a lacrosse fan, and she’s
going to create havoc with your practice schedule or disrupt game day.
Because lacrosse can be played in the rain — and because most kids love
playing in these conditions and getting their uniforms muddy — you can still
get in quality practices or even play games, if your league allows. But some
programs don’t allow practices or games while it’s raining. In these cases,
games are canceled or postponed. Being aware of the league policy regarding
cancellations alleviates a lot of confusion among parents and team members
when bad weather arrives.
To make sure that everyone’s notified about weather-related delays or can-
cellations, ask parents to organize a telephone tree. See Chapter 4 for details.
Exercise great caution with approaching storms. Waiting for the first sign of
lightning before canceling practice or stopping a game is flirting with serious
trouble. Storms should never be taken lightly, and attempting to squeeze in a
few extra minutes of practice or finish a game before the storm hits simply
isn’t worth risking the lives of your players. If conditions become dangerous
during a game, don’t wait for an official to make the call. Get your kids off the
field immediately.
Getting in Gear: Lacrosse Equipment
The physical nature of lacrosse requires players to wear a wide assortment of
protective gear. To do its job, the equipment must be in good condition, meet
appropriate safety standards, and fit the youngsters properly. The following
sections examine the different types of equipment used in boys’ and girls’
lacrosse (see Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2).

 Stick: Sticks come in a variety of lengths and styles. Check with your
league director to determine whether any specific styles are required.
 Mouth guard: This guard protects valuable teeth (and helps save parents
from taking their children on unwanted trips to the dentist for repairs).
 Shoes: Check with the league director regarding the types of cleats that
are allowed, and let parents know so they can purchase the correct
shoes for their child.
 Gloves: Gloves help players hold on to the stick, and also protect their
fingers and hands from the ball or other sticks. Some girls’ leagues don’t
require players to wear gloves.
What boys use
Here is a rundown of the equipment that boys wear:
 Lacrosse helmet with face guard: The helmet and guard protect a
player’s head and eyes. All helmets and face masks should be approved
by the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic
Equipment (NOCSAE).
 Shoulder pads: As the name implies, these pads protect the shoulders.
 Elbow pads: These pads protect the elbows when players fall or get
knocked down.
 Rib pads: Rib pads usually are optional at the younger levels of play but
are recommended to help protect kids’ ribs from being whacked.
 Cup and holder: These pieces are appropriate for older players and cost
about $10.
What girls wear
Here is a look at the equipment that girls wear:
 Lacrosse goggles: Goggles protect the eyes. They feature an eye shield
and a band that wraps around the back of the player’s head to hold
them in place.
 Sports bras/support bras: These items are appropriate for older players.
Because goalies have to face a ball that’s being shot at them, they wear some
different protective equipment, in addition to some of the pieces detailed
above, to help them play their positions safely:
33
Chapter 2: Setting the Stage for a Successful Season

What boys’ and girls’ goalies wear
The kids defending the goal require extra protection, which includes the 
following:
 Chest protector: This garment protects the player’s upper body.
 Shin guards: These items are worn to protect the shins.
 Knee pads: Knee pads come in handy, because goalies often must drop
to the ground to block shots.
 Goalie stick: These sticks are larger than the other players’ sticks,
which helps the goalie block the opposition’s shots.
 Helmet: In both boys’ and girls’ lacrosse players wear helmets with 
a throat protector.
What the league provides
Youth lacrosse leagues across the country are run quite differently, from the
rules they enforce to the equipment they provide for the kids. Some leagues
furnish helmets and sticks; others rely on parents to purchase equipment. In
some leagues, each player gets his own jersey with his name on it; other
leagues loan out plain jerseys for the season, and parents are responsible for
keeping the shirts in good condition and turning them in at the conclusion of
the season.
If parents have to purchase jerseys, they usually buy them through the
league to ensure that each child on the team has the same type and color.
The uniform cost may be included in the registration fee.
What parents must provide
Make sure that parents understand that they’re responsible for purchasing
certain items before your first practice. You don’t want kids showing up with-
out mouth guards, for example — and being forced to watch from the side-
lines — because their parents thought you’d be handing them out.
Parents typically have to provide the following items:
 Water bottle: Every player should bring a water bottle to practices and
games, with her name clearly marked on the bottle.
 Mouth guard: Coaches can request that parents purchase the same
color to help promote team unity.
34
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Because every lacrosse program is different, always check with your league
director to find out what equipment it provides the kids and what the parents
need to purchase. Get this information in advance so that you can let the 
parents know during your preseason parents’ meeting (covered in Chapter 4).

L
acrosse is often referred to as the fastest game on two feet, but if you
aren’t familiar with every aspect of the game, your players’ enjoyment of
the season will slow to a crawl. Your many coaching responsibilities include
knowing all the rules — both the general ones and those that have been spe-
cially modified for your league — and explaining them to your squad. Along
with being able to identify every area of the playing field, you also must have a
crystal-clear understanding of the positions, including the skills required to
play them. And your players will have a more satisfying experience if you can
share with them some of the many unique terms that comprise this great game.
All that valuable information — and much more — awaits you in this chapter.
Playing the Field
The first time you see a lacrosse field, all the lines, circles, and arcs may be
rather confusing. No need to worry, though. When you know what these
markings are and can identify them easily — which we’ll take care of for you
in this section — you’ll see that each marking serves a specific, easy-to-
understand purpose.
Lacrosse fields vary by gender. Figure 3-1 shows a boys’ lacrosse field, and
Figure 3-2 depicts a girls’ lacrosse field. The size of the field your team plays
on will also vary, depending on the type of program you are coaching in and
on the age and skill level of your players.

The markings on the field
A typical lacrosse field features the following elements:
 Arc: The semicircular path between the goal posts.
 Attack area: The area defined by the line on the field that runs sideline
to sideline 20 yards from the face of the goal on a regulation field. When
the offensive team crosses the midfield line, it has 10 seconds to move
the ball into its attack goal area.
 Crease: A circle around the goal, with a 9-foot radius, that only defensive
players may enter.
 Eight-meter arc: The arc in front of each goal in girls’ lacrosse where 
a defender must be within at least a stick’s length of the player she is
covering.
 End line: The boundary line at each end of the field.
 Goal line: The stripe between the goal posts.

 Goal line extended: An imaginary line that runs parallel to the end lines
and that runs from the goal to the sidelines.
 Midfield line: The line that runs from sideline to sideline in the middle
of the field.
 Penalty box: The area where players in boys’ lacrosse must stand for 
a specified time when they are whistled for a personal foul. Penalties
usually are for 1 minute.
 Restraining line: A line located 30 yards from each goal line in girls’
lacrosse, marking the area in which no more than seven offensive players
and eight defensive players (including the goalie) are allowed.
 Sidelines: The two boundary lines that run the entire length of the field.
 Twelve-meter fan: A semi-circle in front of the goal that officials use to
position players after minor fouls have been committed in girls’
lacrosse.

Field dimensions
A regulation men’s lacrosse field measures 110 yards long and 60 yards wide. In
youth lacrosse, fields are scaled down considerably to account for the smaller
bodies (see the “Modifications for various age and experience levels” section,
later in this chapter). Often, one regulation lacrosse field can accommodate
several youth games at one time.
Field sizes vary greatly from community to community and are often dictated
by how much space is available and the number of participants involved in
the league. Be sure to check with your league director to find out what size
field your team will play on.
Knowing the Rules of the Game
Lacrosse is a complex game involving an array of rules. Some rules are a
breeze to understand; others may baffle you initially. If you’re unfamiliar with
all the rules of lacrosse, you can easily become overwhelmed trying to master
them all right away — and become agitated in the process.
Don’t try to memorize the rule book in one evening, because that isn’t realistic.
Instead, focus each night on learning just a few rules and how they’re applied,
and build your base of knowledge from there. It wouldn’t be fair to expect your
players to learn all the rules during the first week of the season, and you don’t
need to put that kind of pressure on yourself, either.
A college lacrosse game is 60 minutes long, with four 15-minute quarters;
sudden-death play is used to break ties at the end of regulation. High school
teams and advanced-level youth lacrosse teams typically play 10-minute quar-
ters. At the younger age levels, teams often play a 30-minute game broken into
15-minute halves, or a 40-minute game split into 20-minute halves. Again, check
with the league director for the specifics on length of games in your league.
A lacrosse game begins with a face-off in the center circle. The ball is placed
between the sticks of the two face-off players in the middle of the field. Play
begins when the official blows the whistle, and each player tries to control
the ball. Center face-offs are also used at the start of each quarter and after a
goal is scored.
When a team has possession of the ball, players attempt to move it down the
field by running with it and making passes to teammates who can get into posi-
tion to score a goal. Generally, the closer a team gets to the opponent’s goal,
the better its chance of scoring. The defending team covers the opponent,
using different types of checks (depending on what is allowed in the league) to
impede the attacking team’s progress and force turnovers.
40
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

When the ball goes out of bounds after a shot on goal, possession is awarded
to the team that is closest to the ball at the moment it crosses the boundary
line. So an offensive team that misses scoring a goal with a shot that goes out
of bounds can retain possession and generate another scoring chance. When
the ball is passed or carried out of bounds, however, possession goes to the
opposing team.
Rules for girls’ leagues
Following are some of the most significant rules to know if you’re overseeing
a girls’ team:
 Face-offs: Games start at the center of the field with a draw. The centers
for each team square off in the middle of the field; they hold their sticks
at waist level and parallel to the ground, with the backs of the pockets
on their sticks touching each other. The referee places the ball between
the two pockets, and when he blows the whistle, the two centers try to
gain control of the ball.
During a face-off (which is also conducted after each goal and to start the
second half), only the centers are allowed in the circle. Also, while the
face-off is taking place, only four players — not counting the center — are
allowed within the restraining lines.
 Players on the field: When a team has possession of the ball and is on the
attack, it may have a maximum seven players inside the restraining line at
the opponent’s end of the field. When the team is playing defense, it can
have only eight players (including the goalie) within the restraining line at
its end of the field.
 Penalties: The referee blows a whistle whenever a ball goes out of
bounds or a foul is committed. Players must stop and remain where they
are when the whistle is blown.
 Throws: Whenever a ball goes out of bounds, the player nearest to the
ball gains possession of it — unless the referee rules that the ball was
thrown out of bounds intentionally, in which case the opposing team is
awarded possession. If two players are ruled to be an equal distance from
the ball, a throw occurs. A throw works this way: The two players stand 
1 meter apart; the referee tosses the ball into the air; and the two players
vie for possession of it. Teammates of the two players contesting the
throw must be at least 4 meters away from them.
 Checking: All types of body checking and rough play are prohibited in
girls’ lacrosse. Defenders aren’t allowed to reach across a player’s body
to check; they can make only stick-to-stick contact.
Have your players imagine an invisible sphere around every player’s
head, and let them know to keep their sticks away from this sphere.
41
Chapter 3: Covering Basic Lacrosse Rules

 No hands: The goalie is the only player who is allowed to touch the ball
with her hands, and only while she is standing within the crease. If she
chooses to leave the crease (to go after a loose ball, for example), a
teammate can take over in the crease for her.
Major fouls in girls’ lacrosse
In girls’ lacrosse, fouls are classified as major and minor. The majority of
major fouls concern playing the game too roughly and making contact with
the body while checking. Here’s a breakdown of the major fouls:
 Blocking: A defender moves into the path of the ball carrier without
giving her any chance to stop or change direction.
 Charging: A player uses her body to run into an opposing player, or
pushes or backs into another player.
 Dangerous shot: A shot that goes toward another player on the field.
 Misconduct: A player purposely endangers the safety of others by 
playing too roughly and not adhering to the rules.
 Slashing: A player on defense swings her stick at an opponent’s stick or
body in a reckless manner. She doesn’t have to make contact with the
other player for this foul to be called.
 Three seconds: Defenders can’t stay in the 8-meter arc for more than 
3 seconds unless they are guarding an opponent closely.
When your player is fouled within the 8-meter arc, the referee awards her
what is known as a free position. This means that the player who was fouled
is awarded possession of the ball, and the defender who was whistled for the
foul must stand at least 4 meters behind her. All other players also must be at
least 4 meters away from the player with the ball. When the referee blows her
whistle to resume play, the ball handler may shoot, pass, or attack the goal.
When a defender commits a major foul in the 8-meter arc area, if the attacking
team is still able to control the ball, the referee won’t stop play. Instead, the
referee throws his flag to indicate that a foul has occurred, but play continues
until the defense gains possession. Then the free position is awarded to the
team whose player was fouled. If a foul occurs that injures a player or puts
someone at risk of injury, of course, play is stopped immediately.
Minor fouls in girls’ lacrosse
Here are some of the most common types of minor fouls:
 Goal-circle foul: Any part of a player’s body or stick (excluding the
goalie) enters the goal circle.
 Warding off: A player removes her hand from the stick to make contact
with an opponent’s body or stick in such a way that she gains an 
advantage.
42
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

 Touching the ball with the hands: A player other than the goalie
touches the ball with her hands. Even the goalie is allowed to touch the
ball with her hands only when she is standing in the crease.
 Body ball: Whenever a player’s body makes contact with the ball and
she gains a clear advantage from it.
When the opponent commits a minor foul against one of your players when
she is within the 8-meter arc, she is awarded an indirect free position. The ref-
eree gives her the ball; the defender must stand at least 4 meters away; and
when the referee blows the whistle to signal the resumption of play, the young-
ster must pass the ball to a teammate before her team can take a shot on goal.
Rules for boys’ leagues
If you’re coaching a boys’ team, you should have a good handle on these rules:
 Face-offs: Each of the two players taking the face-off stands on the same
side of the center line as the goal his team is protecting. The players
must have both hands on their sticks, which must touch the ground. The
back pockets of their sticks touch each other. The referee places the ball
between the two sticks and blows his whistle to signal the start of play,
and the players try to win control of the ball. (For some face-off tech-
niques your players can employ, check out Chapter 11.) Players in the
wing area may vie for the ball; the others must wait until one player has
gained possession of the ball.
 Checking: At advanced levels of play, body checks against the ball carrier
are allowed. The contact must be delivered to the ball carrier’s front or
side, and it must be confined to the area above his waist and below his
shoulders.
 Positions of the players on the field: Each team must keep at least four
players (including the goalie) in its defensive half of the field and three
players in its offensive half. The three midfielders are allowed to roam
the entire field.
 Serving penalties: Whenever a player is serving time in the penalty box,
he must remain there until he is released by the timekeeper. He can return
to the field if the opponent scores a goal or his team gains possession of
the ball in its attack goal area.
 Four seconds: When a goalie makes a stop and has control of the ball, he
has 4 seconds to deliver a pass or move out of the crease with the ball.
During this 4-second period, no one may make contact with him. When
the goalie steps out of the crease with the ball, he can’t return there
until he surrenders possession.
43
Chapter 3: Covering Basic Lacrosse Rules

Personal fouls in boys’ lacrosse
In boys’ lacrosse, fouls are classified as personal and technical. Figure 3-3
shows the referee’s signals for some of the more common types of fouls.
Following are the types of personal fouls:
 Cross-checking: A player uses the handle of his stick to make contact
with an opposing player.
 Illegal body checking: A player delivers a body check to an opponent
who doesn’t have possession of the ball or isn’t within 5 yards of it; he
makes unnecessary contact with the opponent after that player passes
or takes a shot; or he delivers the check from behind the opponent,
below his waist, or above his shoulders.
 Illegal gloves: A player uses gloves that don’t meet the league’s specifi-
cations for safety, or which the player alters in some way.

Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

 Illegal stick: A player uses a stick that doesn’t meet the league’s specifi-
cations. The pocket may be too deep, for example, giving the player an
unfair advantage when he is cradling the ball.
 Slashing: A player’s stick contacts an opponent on any area of his body
other than the gloved hand that is holding the stick.
 Tripping: A player obstructs an opponent below the waist, using his
stick, arms, or legs.
 Unnecessary roughness: A player uses excessive force to contact a
player with his body or stick.
 Unsportsmanlike conduct: The referee determines that a player or
coach has committed an unsportsmanlike act, such as swearing, using
an obscene gesture, or taunting.
When a player commits a personal foul, he must leave the game for 1 minute,
serving his time in the penalty box. This penalty leaves his team short a
player and gives the opposition a good opportunity to generate a goal.
Technical fouls in boys’ lacrosse
Technical fouls aren’t quite as costly to the offending team and are enforced
much differently from personal fouls. When a technical foul is committed, the
referee gives a 30-second penalty to the player who committed the foul if his
team is in possession of the ball, or possession of the ball to the team that
was fouled if it didn’t have possession at the time of the infraction. If neither
team had possession of the ball when the technical foul was whistled, the 
referee awards the ball to the team whose player was fouled at the spot of the
infraction. In this situation, no penalty time is served by the opposition.
Following are the types of technical fouls:
 Holding: A player disrupts an opponent’s movement by grabbing him or
his stick.
 Illegal procedure: Any unnecessary delay occurs, such as not substitut-
ing players correctly or having players standing in the crease area,
which is off limits to everyone except the goalie.
 Illegal screen: An offensive player makes contact with a defender while
trying to block him from defending the player he is trying to cover.
 Interference: A player impedes the movements of the opponent when he
doesn’t have possession of the ball and isn’t within 5 yards of a loose ball.
 Offside: A team fails to have at least three players on its offensive side
of the midfield line and at least four players on its defensive side of the
midfield line.
 Pushing: A player shoves an opponent from behind.
45
Chapter 3: Covering Basic Lacrosse Rules

 Stalling: The team with the ball intentionally tries to run time off the
clock by holding on to it instead of running its normal offensive attack.
The referee also calls a stalling foul when players trap the ball on the
field with their sticks longer than necessary.
When an attacking player is fouled in the opponent’s half of the field, the ref-
eree usually won’t blow his whistle to stop play. Instead, he throws a flag in
recognition of the foul that was committed but allows the attacking team to
continue its drive. As soon as the offensive team takes a shot on goal, loses
possession of the ball, or fails to move the ball forward, the referee stops,
and the player who committed the penalty heads to the penalty box to serve
his time. If the team scores a goal on the shot, however, the penalty is erased.
Special rules
Lacrosse can be modified easily to fit the age, experience, and skill level of
the players participating. At the beginning levels of youth lacrosse, coaching
is all about teaching kids the basics of the game, not adhering to the rule
book that’s used in the upper ranks of organized lacrosse. In the sections that
follow, we outline adjustments to the rules and field that are common in
youth leagues.
Fewer kids on the field at younger age levels
Although a regulation lacrosse game features 10 players per team in boys’
games and 12 players for each team in girls’ games, the younger the children
are, the fewer you have on the field at any given time. The idea at the youngest
age levels is to introduce kids to the game by giving them lots of touches of the
ball — a situation that can happen only when just a few players are on the field.
Imagine having a full squad of beginning 6-year-olds on the field at the same
time! Each child would be lucky to touch the ball a couple of times during the
game, which wouldn’t be much fun.
Modifications for various age and experience levels
Following are some of the ways lacrosse is modified in programs around the
country to meet children’s needs:
 Reduced field size: Typically in youth lacrosse, the younger the players
are, the smaller the field that they play on. If you put beginning players
on a large field, they’d have to expend too much energy to run up and
down it, and they’d get few opportunities to get their sticks on the ball.
Even when they did manage to scoop up the ball, chances are that
they’d be too tired to do anything with it.
Depending on how much field space a recreation agency has, the size of
a youth lacrosse field varies from community to community. Keeping
beginning-level players confined in a small playing area allows them lots
46
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

of touches of the ball. As players get older, stronger, and faster, they can
expect to play on larger fields.
 No-goalie games: At the beginning levels of youth lacrosse, it’s not
uncommon to have no goalies manning the nets. Because the kids
haven’t yet developed many of the skills that are required to play the
game, sticking a child in front of the net doesn’t make a lot of sense;
after all, chances are good that he’ll see more grasshoppers than shots
on goal. At the early stages of youth lacrosse, you simply want to intro-
duce the kids to running with the ball, as well as passing it and shooting
it in the general direction they are aiming at. Trying to fake out a goal-
tender and get shots past him come later in the skill-development
process.
 Fewer rules in place: Usually, the younger the players, the fewer rules
are followed. The offside rule, for example, typically isn’t enforced in a
beginner league, because the kids aren’t ready to grasp this aspect of
the game.
Sometimes, leagues instruct their officials not to call certain penalties,
but to let a child know what she did wrong so she can begin developing
sound habits. This tactic allows the child to learn about the infraction
and keeps the game moving along.
 On-the-field coaching: Some youth leagues allow coaches to be on the
field of play during games so that they can provide easy-to-understand
instruction to the kids. Remember, at this level, lacrosse isn’t about
scoring more goals than the other team. Many youth leagues don’t even
keep score at the youngest levels.
 Modified stick-checking: In girls’ lacrosse, many leagues have specific
policies regarding the use of sticks while checking. In a beginning-level
program, stick checking may be allowed only when an offensive player’s
stick is at waist level or below; in a slightly more-advanced league, stick
checks may be allowed only against offensive players whose sticks are at
chest level or below. These rules ensure that players who are just getting
accustomed to using lacrosse sticks don’t risk injuring anyone by 
swinging their sticks wildly.

during practices and games; otherwise, your players may misinterpret or
misunderstand your instructions.
Taking Up Positions
In lacrosse, the object of the game is the same for both boys and girls: Score
as many goals as possible during the allotted time while preventing the
opposing team from doing the same thing. But girls’ and boys’ lacrosse also
have differences, including the positions on the field and the skills needed to
play them. The following sections take a closer look at these positions and
the responsibilities that come with handling them. 
Positions in boys’ lacrosse
In boys’ lacrosse, the basic positions are goalie, defender, midfielder, and
attacker (see Figure 3-4). A typical full-scale game features one goalie, three
defenders, three midfielders, and three attackers.
The skills that are required to play these positions are as different as the kids
under your care who will be manning them for you. Starting from your own
goal and working out, the following section outlines each position in boys’
lacrosse. (For the scoop on assigning kids to different positions, check out
Chapter 5.)
50
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Goalie
This player positions himself between the goal posts, and his top responsibil-
ity is to defend your team’s goal and stop the ball from going into the net.
Good hand–eye coordination and quick reflexes are musts for faring well in
this position, because the goalie faces shots from all angles and at varied
speeds. Size and speed are nonfactors when it comes to goaltending success,
because any player who has the desire to play well here, as well as the
courage to face hard-thrown shots without flinching, can excel and be an
asset to the team.
Along with defending the net, goalies are counted on to perform many other
tasks, including the following:
 Communicating with the defense: When the team is defending an
attack, the goalie must communicate to his teammates what is unfolding
on the field. Because the goalie has the best view of the field — and
because some of his teammates will have their backs to the play — he
can alert them to certain plays that are being run or tell them where
they need to position themselves to stop the attack. He can also warn
his teammates when picks are being set so that they can counter those
moves. (See Chapter 16 for details on defending picks.)
 Fueling the offensive attack: When your goalie has secured the ball, his
job isn’t done by a long shot. Whenever he stops a shot, he should be
looking upfield to see whether a teammate is available to receive a clear-
ing pass that begins an attack, catching the opponent out of position.
(For more on training goalies in the art of delivering clearing passes,
check out Chapter 16.)

Chapter 3: Covering Basic Lacrosse Rules

Defenders
These players typically don’t receive as much recognition or accolades as the
attacker and midfielders, because they aren’t directly involved in the plays
that produce the goals. But they are just as important as the other positions
on the field.
No matter how good your offense is at netting goals, if the team struggles at
the defensive end of the field, it probably won’t have a lot of success on game
days. For more on teaching defensive techniques, head to Chapter 10, and
when you’re ready to help your players upgrade those defensive skills, check
out Chapter 12.
Because a team must keep at least four players (including the goalie) on its
defensive half of the field at all times, defenders rarely stray past midfield.
Instead, their responsibilities revolve around covering opposing players on
the attack. Defenders rely on good footwork to shadow opponents all over
the field. They also use a variety of checks, such as poke checks and — if the
league allows them — body checks (covered in Chapter 10). Good passing
skills also enable defenders to ignite attacks by getting the ball to their 
midfielders and attackers running down the field.
Midfielders
Lacrosse is a sport of fast-paced transitions, with teams switching back and
forth from offense to defense all game long. The midfielders’ effectiveness on
transitions has a big influence on the team’s effectiveness at both the offensive
and defensive ends of the field. Since midfielders cover the most territory of
any position — they roam all over the field — the quicker they recognize situa-
tions the more effective they’ll be. For example, when a midfielder anticipates a
teammate gaining control of the ball the player can begin moving toward the
opponent’s goal to try to create a scoring opportunity by outnumbering the
opposition and catching it off guard or out of position.
Midfielders typically aren’t counted on to provide a lot of scoring punch. The
more important qualities for this position are good stick skills for winning
duels over loose balls, accurate passing skills, and the stamina to stick with
opposing attackers.
Attackers
The responsibility for scoring goals falls squarely on the shoulders of the
attackers, who spend games roaming in the opponent’s half of the field.
Attackers, of course, must rely on the defenders to stop the opposition and
the midfielders to feed them the ball, because lacrosse is a team sport, but
when they have control of the ball, getting shots on net is largely up to them.
52
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

The most productive attackers use a variety of shots to keep the goalie
guessing. The sidearm and long bounce shots are among the weapons that
attackers should have in their arsenals. (Chapter 9 provides the lowdown 
on executing these shots.)
Another key asset for attackers is to possess more moves than a disco
dancer. When they’re closing in on the opponent’s goal, and defenders are
bumping and stick-checking them, being able to spin free allows for more
goal-scoring opportunities. Besides being able to score, attackers must
develop a knack for making passes to cutting teammates, often in heavy traf-
fic, to generate scoring chances.
Even though your attackers will likely score the majority of your team’s goals,
be sure to acknowledge all the efforts that led to the score. Every youngster
plays an important role in the team’s success, and it’s up to you to make each
child feel valued and appreciated for his efforts, whatever those may be.
Positions in girls’ lacrosse
One of the significant differences in girls’ lacrosse is that more players take
the field in a regulation game. The following sections discuss the positions in
the girls’ game (see Figure 3-5) and the responsibilities that go along with
them, beginning with the goalie and working out away from the net.

Goalie
The primary role of this position is keeping balls out of the net. Besides making
saves with her stick, the goalie uses any body part necessary to prevent the
opposition from celebrating a goal. She is also expected to communicate with
her teammates to let them know where they should be positioned to deny the
opponent’s attack.
A goalie must be quick on her feet and willing to go after loose balls around
the crease area. The more confident your goalie is, the more effective she’ll
be at turning away the different types of shots she’ll be facing. (For some
great beginning goalie drills — if we do say so ourselves — to build skills and
confidence, head to Chapter 14.)
Point
After the goaltender position, point is the most defensive-oriented position
on the field. The player handling this position works closely with the goalie,
communicating what the opponent is doing and orchestrating where players
need to be on the field to counter the attack.
Your point player must be a good communicator to help prevent defensive
breakdowns from occurring. She covers the opponent’s first home, so sound
checking skills are imperative for keeping that player from getting open shots
on net. Because the point player plays so close to the net — and doesn’t stray
far from this area of the field throughout the game — she’s often in position to
intercept passes to the middle of the field while defending an attack.
Cover point
This player’s main task is to cover the opposition’s second home. Good foot-
work is an asset for excelling in this position, because the player must stick
with the opponent to deny passes and shots on goal.
The cover point player is also relied on to make clearing passes, so she must
be proficient at catching passes from the goalie and quickly turning upfield to
look for teammates who can receive the ball.
Third player
This player’s key responsibility is covering the opposing team’s third home.
Important attributes for doing well in this position are good reflexes, the ability
to read the opponent’s attack, and the ability to jump into the passing lanes to
intercept balls.
Left and right defensive wings
These positions require a substantial amount of running, as the players’ 
primary responsibility is to guard the opponent’s left and right attack wings.
Besides covering these opponents, the defensive wings move the ball across
midfield to help out on the attack when their team has the ball.
54
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Center
This position is a magnet of activity on both offense and defense. Because the
position requires strong play both with and without the ball, as well as a vari-
ety of other skills, the team’s best player usually handles this position.
The center patrols the middle of the field. When her team has control of the
ball, she looks to step up into the action, where she can feed the ball to the
first, second, and third home players. When her team is on defense, she
retreats to her team’s defensive half of the field, providing coverage against
the opponent’s center, disrupting the passing lanes, and looking to intercept
balls delivered by the attack wings.
At the beginning levels of lacrosse, you should do your best to ensure that
the girls get the chance to play as many positions as possible. That way, they
can fully experience what the sport is about. Only at the advanced levels of
lacrosse should you be concerned about players handling a specific position
on the field.
Left and right attack wings
These positions require covering a lot of territory. The players carry out sup-
portive roles at the offensive end of the field — most notably, feeding the ball
to the players manning the first, second, and third home positions. They also
must hustle back on defense to help out the left and right defensive wings.
When your team turns the ball over in the opponent’s end of the field, your
attack wings have to hustle back to lend defensive support. If they’re unable
to get back in time, the opponent has a scoring opportunity.
Third home
A team’s offensive prowess is enhanced whenever its third home player is 
an efficient passer. She can feed the ball to the first and second home players,
as well as the right and left attack wings. She also takes shots on goal when
scoring opportunities arise and creates openings for herself to shoot or pass.
Second home
This position is similar to the point guard position in basketball, because the
second home orchestrates the offense and makes the passes that help the
offense run smoothly and effectively. In lacrosse, this player should be an
excellent ball handler, because she’ll likely have the ball on her stick more than
most of the other players. It’s also helpful if she’s comfortable maneuvering
behind the opponent’s goal and delivering passes from there to teammates 
cutting to the net.
Collecting assists isn’t her only responsibility, though. The offense will be more
difficult to defend if the second home player is a threat to score goals, too.
When this player can mix up shooting and passing, she keeps the opponent 
off balance.
55
Chapter 3: Covering Basic Lacrosse Rules

First home
This position represents the most offensive play on the lacrosse field. The
first home’s main responsibilities are to score goals and to deliver accurate
passes to teammates who are in scoring position.
To excel in this position, a youngster must be quick, with good footwork that
helps her maneuver around defenders; she must have sound ball-control skills,
so she can maintain possession while negotiating the defensive congestion
she’ll regularly encounter around the net; and she must be able to recognize
opportunities to exploit the defense with accurate passes. The more types of
shots she’s comfortable executing while defenders are harassing her from all
angles, the more potent your team will be every time it ventures toward the
opponent’s goal.

ood communication skills are important for air traffic controllers, public
speakers, and volunteer lacrosse coaches too. The better your communi-
cation skills are, the bigger impact you’ll have on your players, and the greater
chance you’ll forge a positive relationship with all their parents. Your ability to
interact with parents and encourage them to work with you rather than against
you determines — to a large extent — whether you have a smooth season or
bump into obstacles at every turn.
In this chapter, we help you plan the preseason parents’ meeting, which is
imperative for getting the season headed in the right direction. We cover the
items you need to share with parents, ranging from your coaching philosophy
to your policy on spectator behavior and including piles of paperwork. We
also discuss enlisting parents to do all sorts of jobs that can ease your work-
load and keep your focus where it needs to be: on the kids. It’s time to meet
those parents!

Planning the Preseason Parents’ Meeting
Holding a preseason parents’ meeting before you step on the field with your
team is as important to you as a full tank of gas is to a race-car driver at the
start of a race. Without the fuel, the driver has no chance of being successful,
and the same holds true for you if you skip this meeting. It’s one of the most
important hours you’ll spend this season.
The preseason parents’ meeting serves multiple purposes:
 It’s a chance for parents to get to know who their children will be 
spending time with this season.
 It’s an opportunity for you to let parents know how you’ll be managing
the team and handling all the issues that pop up during the course of a
season.
 It opens critical lines of communication and sends the all-important
message that you’ll be working with parents to help ensure that their
children have a rewarding season.
Making a good first impression
First impressions leave lasting imprints on parents. Because this meeting is
so significant, approach it with the same effort and enthusiasm you would
apply to an interview for a job you covet. Explaining your thoughts clearly on
the topics you’ll be covering demonstrates how deeply you care about the
upcoming season and reinforces your commitment to each child on the team.
Parents will appreciate your initiative and feel much more at ease turning
their children over to you this season.
The more comfortable parents are with you, the stronger your relationship is
going to be with both them and their children.
Covering the important points
Here are some additional points to keep in mind regarding the meeting:
 Touch base with all the parents as soon as possible. Most parents
juggle chaotic schedules, so getting everyone together can be a little
tricky. As soon as you get your hands on your team roster, contact each
child’s parents via phone. Introduce yourself as the coach; let them
know the date, time, and location you chose for your parents’ meeting;
and stress the importance of being there. Giving parents as much notice
58
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

as possible gives them time to rearrange their schedules, if necessary,
and increases their likelihood of showing up.
 Find a familiar meeting place. Your best bet is to meet at the offices of
the recreation department that runs the league. If you let the league
director know you want to meet with your team members’ parents, he or
she can make arrangements to reserve a room for you. If meeting at the
recreation department isn’t an option, local libraries often have meeting
rooms available. Be sure you check with the library staff to ensure the
room can accommodate how many parents you invited to attend. 
 Pick a convenient time. Choose a time that matches, as closely as possi-
ble, the time your team will take the field for practice. This way, you’ll
know that your meeting fits into most parents’ schedules.
 Plan for less than an hour. The meeting should last at least half an hour,
but no more than an hour. Just like your practices should only be an
hour in length, there is no reason to drag out a meeting beyond this time
frame either.
 Outline your key points. Jot down the main points you want to cover. 
A great starting point is to ask yourself what you would want to know if
you were handing your child over to a coach you didn’t know. You’d
want to know what type of coaching experience the coach has, how
often the team is going to be practicing, and how positions and playing
time will be determined, among many other areas.
 Rehearse your presentation. What do you tell kids to do to get better at
something? Right: practice. The same applies to you concerning public
speaking. Proper preparation is the best antidote for speaking nerves. In
the days leading up to the meeting, stand in front of a mirror, and prac-
tice what you’re going to say. If you sense that you’re going to be really
uncomfortable, rehearse in front of your spouse, a family member, or a
friend. No one expects you to be a professional speaker or to sound like
a polished politician delivering an address, but the more comfortable
you are, the more smoothly your talk will go.
 Take good notes along. Outline all your main points on a notepad, and
bring it to the meeting. Referring to your notes often throughout the
meeting isn’t a sign of weakness; it indicates that you want to make sure
you’re covering all the important points for the parents’ benefit.
 Talk off the cuff. Don’t write out everything you want to say and read it
word for word at the meeting. Just reading a speech will bore parents
and make them wonder how much fun their children are going to have
with you this season.
 Schedule time to have the parents introduce themselves. Parents will
be seeing quite a bit of one another during the season, so at some point
during the meeting, have the parents introduce themselves (and tell the
group who their children are, too). Although some parents may already
know one another, introductions are good ice-breakers.
59
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

 Organize your handouts. Collect all the paperwork you need to give
parents, and plan to pass it out at the end of your meeting, prior to 
conducting your question and answer segment. Holding the paperwork
to the end prevents distractions; otherwise, some parents may tune out
what you have to say because they’re too busy flipping through your
handouts. For more info, see “Managing Paperwork Parents Need to Fill
Out” later in this chapter.
Allow parents to ask questions at any time during the meeting or, if they
prefer, to hold on to their questions till the question-and-answer period at 
the end.
Despite your efforts, if any parent simply can’t make the meeting, arrange to
go over everything with him or her later — on the phone or in person — to
share what you covered during the meeting. You don’t want to head into the
season without touching base with all the parents and clearly explaining
what’s in store for their children. Also make arrangements to get the 
paperwork to them, either via mail or meeting with them in person.
Explaining Your Coaching Philosophy
Your first task in the meeting — after introducing yourself — is introducing
your coaching philosophy. To reduce the chances of misunderstandings
throughout the season, let parents know up front how you’ll be handling the
team. Clearly defining your stance on playing time, good sportsmanship, and
other issues represents the foundation of your coaching philosophy (see
Chapter 2 for more on developing your philosophy). Giving parents this
heads-up provides ample time for them to find a more appropriate league or
level of competitiveness for their children if they discover that the current
one isn’t a good fit.
Emphasizing good sportsmanship 
for players
The best lacrosse coaches teach kids the fundamentals of the game — skills
such as stick handling, shooting, and defense — as well as other aspects that
often don’t get the attention they deserve, such as good sportsmanship.
Parents appreciate knowing that their youngsters are learning what being a
good sport means; how the team behaves after both wins and losses is
always more important than how team members performed on the field.
60
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Tell parents that you’ll be having your team shake hands with the opponents
following each game. Note that when your players win, you’ll expect them to
refrain from excessive celebrating, and when they lose, you’ll expect them to
congratulate their opponents for playing well.
Modeling good sportsmanship isn’t easy, but playing fairly, showing respect
toward referees regardless of the call, and accepting the game’s results 
graciously are important traits to teach young players. The habits they pick
up from you are the ones they’ll carry with them during their future years if
playing lacrosse or any other organized sport. You can feel good knowing
that you instilled positive traits in your players. (For more on teaching
sportsmanship by example, see Chapter 2.)
Maintaining model parent 
behavior in the stands
When it comes to explaining the type of behavior you expect from parents
during games, be very clear and straightforward; leave no room for misinter-
pretation or misunderstanding. Emphasize the importance of modeling good
sportsmanship before, during, and after games. Let the parents know that
children don’t perform as well — or have as much fun — when they’re being
screamed at to score a goal or to get back on defense.
Your season will go more smoothly and will be more enjoyable for everyone
involved when parents are working with you — not against you — as you teach
your players proper behavior. If you can get parents to understand fully the
importance of showing good sportsmanship, their youngsters will be more
likely to follow in their footsteps. If your message to the team is distorted by
unruly parent behavior in the stands, these mixed signals can lead to confusion
and problems. Actions — yours as well as those of the parents in the stands —
speak much louder than any words.
Stress the following points to parents:
 Bad behavior can get them ejected. Make it clear that although you never
want to have to remove parents from the stands for behaving inappropri-
ately, you won’t hesitate to do so if they’re being a negative influence.
(Many leagues have policies for removing spectators, and you should be
aware of what steps you’re required to follow.) Don’t be condescending in
your tone, but hammer home the point that the game is about the kids.
You want their memories to be of having fun and developing skills — not
of watching out-of-control parents make everyone miserable. (See Chapter
18 for more on dealing with disruptive parents.)
61
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

 Audience participation should be positive. You never want parents
yelling at officials, coaches, or players on either team. Spectators’ 
comments should be only positive and encouraging — and never so
overbearing that they infringe on your communication with the players.
 Only coaches should coach. Let parents know that they need to refrain
from shouting directions, because hearing multiple sets of instructions
confuses kids. Remind parents that you’re the coach and that all the
coaching needs to come from you.
 Officials are people too. Especially at the beginning levels of play, the
officials may be teenagers who — despite doing their best — may make
some mistakes. (Everyone makes mistakes, because we’re all human.)
Remind parents that yelling at officials is unacceptable, no matter how
bad a call seems to be. Explain that having calls go against your team is
simply part of the game and that over the course of the season, the calls
will certainly balance out.
When the parents don’t make a big deal about calls, neither will the kids.
By the time the game ends, the players won’t give that penalty call
another thought — as long as they didn’t hear Mom or Dad screaming
about it at the top of their lungs.
Determining playing time and positions
Coaching a youth lacrosse team involves making as many decisions as the
chief executive officer of a Fortune 500 company — or at least it seems that
way. A couple of the most challenging decisions you face are assigning 
playing time and positions.
A lot of parents sign a child up for lacrosse with a position in mind that they
think the child is best suited for. This plan seldom works out the way they
envision — particularly when half a dozen dads think their sons should be
the goaltender. Explaining your process for positioning kids well in advance
of stepping on the field for that first practice of the season alleviates some of
these potential headaches. It’s also important to run down your philosophy
on playing time. At the beginning levels of play game day minutes are divvied
up equally among all the players, as long as they regularly attend your 
practices. Only at the more advanced levels of play is playing time dictated
by skill level.
Assigning playing time
Many parents keep track of their child’s minutes on the field as closely as
they do the figures in their checkbook. Telling parents how you decide how
long each player spends on the field can help prevent misunderstandings 
and frustration. (If questions about playing minutes surface later during the
season, flip to Chapter 18 for tips on dealing with these issues.)

Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

For kids, playing lacrosse is all about being on the field, running around and
getting lots of opportunities to shoot, pass and catch the ball. Take a look
anywhere kids get together to play pickup games; nobody stands on the side-
lines, because that’s as exciting as being given a big homework assignment
for the weekend. Giving kids equal opportunities to play is crucial for their
development in the sport. Kids who are forced to sit on the bench for long
stretches, or who don’t receive the same amount of playing time as their
friends, quickly lose interest in the sport.
Whether you’re coaching a couple dozen players or barely enough to make 
a complete team, one of your top priorities on game day (see Chapter 8 for
more on this aspect of coaching) is making sure that playing time is divvied up
equally among the kids, regardless of how fast they are, how accurately they
shoot, or how well they defend — as long as they attend practices regularly.
It’s not fair to the kids who show up for every practice to have to share play-
ing time with teammates who appear only on game day. Be sure to discuss
that policy with parents ahead of time to prevent conflicts during games.
At the older and more advanced stages of lacrosse (usually around the age 
of 14), where winning games takes on a more prominent role, playing time 
is distributed based on the player’s ability. The same goes for travel teams.
(For more details on coaching this more elite level of lacrosse, check out
Chapter 19.)
As kids move up the lacrosse ladder and stick around the sport for several sea-
sons — hopefully, in part, because they’ve had so much fun playing for you and
want it to continue — they’ll recognize that games take on a more competitive
feel and that will be embraced by many. Gradually, they’ll also begin comparing
their skills to others on their team, as well as their opponents, and develop a
sense of where they fit in skill-wise. When letting kids know how playing time 
is divvied up, emphasize that everyone plays a significant role on the team,
regardless if they’re a starter or not, and everyone contributes something in
their own unique way. (For the scoop on working with all different types of
kids, flip to Chapter 5.)
Lining up: Who plays where and why
Choosing playing positions for all the kids — at the advanced levels of play —
is like putting together a Rubik’s Cube. You’ve got all these different colors
that somehow go together, much like all your different players, and it’s up to
you to figure out the right combinations.
When you’re coaching at the youngest age levels, your mission is simply to
give kids a taste of as many positions as possible so that they enjoy a well-
rounded experience. Most parents will appreciate your interest in giving kids
a chance to try different aspects of the game.
63
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

If you slide a youngster into an offensive position during the first practice of
the season, for example, and never allow him even a glimpse of what playing
defense is like, you’re not giving him a true taste of the sport. Who knows? He
may end up walking away from the game after the season because he didn’t
enjoy playing the position you gave him; he might have loved playing a defen-
sive position instead and would’ve stayed involved in lacrosse for years to
come. Parents who are disappointed that their child isn’t getting to play a
specific position full time may be pleasantly surprised to see him excel in a
different position.
Other parents who had their hearts set on their child’s playing a particular
position all season may not be thrilled that she’ll be moved around on the
field. Those parents may opt to sign the child up elsewhere, thanks to your
advance notice of how the season is going to run, which prevents potential
headaches for everyone.
Managing Paperwork Parents 
Need to Fill Out
Most youth lacrosse programs around the country require parents to sign 
a series of forms. These forms are usually filled out during registration, but
sometimes the responsibility of securing parents’ John Hancocks on all the
paperwork falls to you. Although the content and style of paperwork varies
from league to league, the purpose is generally the same. This section gives
you a rundown of the forms you may see.
Beyond the league paperwork, you can make your job easier (and keep your
sanity in the process) by distributing your own packets of information to 
parents. These packets can include
64
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 
Talking to the parents of more advanced kids
At the more advanced levels, figuring out where
kids are best suited to play takes on more impor-
tance and impacts how much success a team
enjoys. You may have four or five kids who des-
perately want to play goalie, but your job is figuring
out which player has the talent and proper attitude
to handle the position, as well as determining what
other positions those players who were eyeing
that spot can fill to best help the team excel.
Remember, at the older and more advanced levels
of play the game day minutes are given to the
most-skilled athletes, so it’s important that parents
are aware of this. In Chapter 5, we go into detail on
evaluating players and assigning positions.

 Team rosters and contact information for everyone, including yourself.
 Practice and game schedules.
 Basic information on lacrosse (a big help for parents who aren’t familiar
with the sport).
 A rundown of the rules. (To prevent confusion, highlight any rules that
the league has modified. Check out Chapter 2 for a look at some rules
that are often tweaked by leagues.)
League documents
Most leagues require parents to fill out a variety of forms before the kids can
put on their helmets:
 Practice and game schedules: Leagues typically set the schedule for the
season well in advance, so be sure parents get a copy so they can plan
accordingly. Also, if the league has assigned your team specific days and
times to use the field for practice, make sure to give parents that schedule
as well. The more information parents have, the better they can plan for
what’s coming each week.
 Consent form: A consent form states that a child may get hurt during
practices or games, and says that in the event of an injury, the league isn’t
responsible. Most programs carry insurance against possible litigation. Be
sure you ask about the league’s coverage and your own status under the
policy, and share with the parents.
The National Youth Sports Coaches Association (a program of the
National Alliance for Youth Sports) provides insurance coverage to
coaches who complete its training program. The association recom-
mends that all coaches go through training to help ensure that they are
knowledgeable in all areas of the sport and can provide a safe and fun
experience for every child on their team. For more information visit
www.nays.org.
 Medical evaluation form: This form, signed by the child’s physician,
states that the youngster is physically healthy and able to participate in
the sport. If the child has a condition such as asthma or diabetes, that
condition is listed on this sheet. (For more details on what should be in
a properly stocked first-aid kit, which is your responsibility, check out
Chapter 6.)
Personal packets
You can make a great impression on all the parents by providing information
packets. Parents will appreciate and use these handy resources throughout
the season:
65
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

 Rules guide: For some parents, the sport of lacrosse is unfamiliar, and
chances are that many of them aren’t up to speed on all the rules and ter-
minology of the game. You — and they — simply don’t have time to go
over the game itself in great detail without dragging the meeting into all
hours of the night. To help them out, as well as save them hours searching
the Internet for information on the game, print up the following:
• A rules primer — a couple of pages on the basics of the game —
that they can review to get a better understanding of lacrosse.
• A page noting any special rules in effect in the league. (Maybe the
league has instructed officials not to call certain penalties to keep
the game moving, for example.)
• A rough sketch of the field, indicating where each player is 
positioned.
• Definitions of some basic terms that they’ll hear often during the
season.
• A page describing the referees’ hand signals and what they mean
(you can copy them from Chapter 3).
 Phone list and contact information: A sheet with all the kids’ names
and their parents’ telephone numbers and e-mail addresses can be
handy for parents. At some point during the season, someone may need
to contact another parent to arrange for a child’s ride to practice.
Make sure that you include your own contact information for parents
who want to get in touch with you later.
 Emergency treatment authorization form: The child’s parent or
guardian signs this league form, which lists the names of usually three
people, as a rule of thumb, who should be contacted if the child is
injured and requires emergency medical treatment. The form usually
gives the coach or other league personnel the authority to seek medical
treatment for the child if no one can be reached.
Recruiting Parents to 
Help on the Sidelines
Parents put in a lot of effort and make sacrifices along the way to help ensure
that their children have a memorable time playing lacrosse. As a result, most
parents are willing to lend a hand to help make the season run smoothly.
66
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

Encouraging your players’ parents to take an active interest in the season
lays out the welcome mat for those who want to help. Parents can assist in
many ways that can make a difference in the quality of your team’s season.
Attracting assistant coaches
Running a quality lacrosse practice takes a lot of work, so the more bodies
you can count on — whether it’s friends you’re comfortable working with or
parents you appoint as assistant coaches — the more efficient your sessions
can be, as well as the more beneficial for the kids. When you can put knowl-
edgeable and caring adults in assistant coaching positions, you’ll increase
your chances of accomplishing more each session. The payoff will be greater
skill development for the players — and more fun, too.
In addition to helping during practices, assistant coaches can be valuable
resources on game day (for more details, check out Chapter 8), providing
additional sets of eyes and ears.
Assistants can help you in many areas, such as the following:
 Monitoring minutes: Assistants can monitor your substitution patterns
and track each child’s playing time to ensure that everyone receives an
equal amount. This info comes in handy if a parent ever questions the
amount of playing time his or her child is receiving (see Chapter 18 for
more on dealing with those types of parents).
 Assisting with pregame responsibilities: You have many duties to fulfill
on game day before play begins, such as meeting with the officials and
the opposing coach. Being able to rely on an assistant to run your
warmups and oversee the stretching routine frees you to perform your
other duties.
 Keeping parents in check: When the game begins, your focus is on the
players, to ensure that they’re having a fun and safe experience, so if
parents make inappropriate comments to the officials (or anyone else),
you may not hear them. Assistant coaches can alert you to these issues
so that you can address them at the appropriate time to ensure that par-
ents conduct themselves properly. (Refer to “Maintaining model parent
behavior in the stands” earlier in this chapter for details on communi-
cating your expectations, and check out Chapter 18 for help on dealing
with problem parents.)
 Scouting the opponent: At more advanced levels of play (with older
kids), you can have your assistants check out the opposition players as
they warm up. Maybe they’ll spot a tendency in the other team’s pass-
ing, such as passing to the left a majority of the time, or they may note
that certain players aren’t as proficient at handling passes. These little
bits and pieces of information can help your players enjoy higher levels
of success on the field.
67
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

Poll the group to see who is interested in helping out on the sidelines, but
hold off on naming your assistants at this time. You probably won’t know
most (if any) of the parents at your preseason meeting, particularly if you’re
in your first season of coaching. Use the first few practices of the season to
get to know the parents and gauge how they interact with the children —
their own and others. You may want to set aside some time after the first 
few practices to interview any interested parents, making sure that their
approaches and philosophies match yours. By going this route, you’re more
likely to select parents who will support your coaching philosophy (see
Chapter 2) and emphasize the fun and learning you want to stress.
At more advanced levels of play, you always want to find out in advance who’s
interested in assisting and set aside times to interview them. Question their
experience playing and coaching the game, why they want to be involved, and
how they think they can be assets to your team. Through interviews, you want
to determine who’s going to be helpful and who’s going to be a hindrance.
Assistants can be of enormous value, but if they overstep their roles, they can
create unwanted confusion.
Your assistants are among the most important selections you’ll make,
because your coaching will only be as good as your worst assistant.
Exercise great care in choosing assistants, because some parents can surprise
you the first time they step on the field with you. They may try taking over
your practices by imposing their own teaching methods, for example, or they
may require so much mentoring that they detract from your time with the kids.
What you want to steer clear of at all costs — much like a bad case of food poi-
soning — is choosing a parent who seems laid-back at your preseason meeting
but transforms into a yeller when the games begin. If you somehow make a bad
judgment call on a parent, you must solve this touchy problem immediately so
that it doesn’t linger and cause additional headaches for everyone. (You can
find suggestions for dealing with this problem in Chapter 18.)
Signing up parents for support roles
Many parents probably never played lacrosse growing up, and the sport may
be unfamiliar to them, so they’re not going to be jumping at the chance to
provide instruction on the field. Inexperience with lacrosse doesn’t mean that
they can’t help out in other areas, though. Most parents want to be involved
to some degree; they just need to know where they can fit in.
Following are some of the jobs you can recruit parents to fill:
68
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

 Telephone-tree coordinator: When Mother Nature drops rain on the field
a few hours before a practice or game, parents won’t know whether they
still need to get their children to the field or whether they get a break for
the day from chauffeuring duties. If a game or practice is canceled, it’s
impossible for you to contact every parent in a timely manner. Enter the
telephone-tree coordinator, who maintains a list of all the parents’ num-
bers to ensure that messages are communicated to everyone quickly.
If you need to cancel an event, let your telephone-tree coordinator know
that the event is canceled and when it’s rescheduled for. The coordinator
calls, e-mails, or text messages two parents on the phone list; those two
parents do the same for two parents, and so on. In a matter of minutes,
everyone has been contacted.
 Team parent: Handing out chilled beverages or healthy postgame
snacks (see Chapter 17) is a nice way to wrap up a practice session or
game. Choose a team parent who can put together a schedule assigning
parents the games or practices they’re responsible for bringing snacks
to. This role can also include organizing an end-of-season pizza party or
even making arrangements to take the entire team to watch a local high
school or college lacrosse game.
 Concession-stand worker: Some leagues require each team to provide 
a couple of parents to work the league’s concession stand during the
season. Check with the league director to find out what dates need filling,
and see which of your parents are willing to handle that role.
 Photo coordinator: Team photos are great keepsakes for the children,
who years from now will enjoy seeing pictures of themselves and their
teammates all decked out in their uniforms. Some leagues work directly
with a local photography company; in other leagues, organizing a photo
shoot is left to the discretion of the coach. Either way, having a parent
fulfill the photo-coordinator position can be extremely helpful.
Besides working with you to select a convenient time for the team
photo, the photo coordinator can arrange for a photographer to come
out for a game or two to take action shots of the kids. Just be sure to
verify that all the parents are on board with forking over extra cash for
these photos.
 Team trainer: Lacrosse is a contact sport, which means that during the
season, children are going to suffer bumps and bruises, scrapes and abra-
sions, and other minor aches and pains. Ask a parent who’s been properly
trained in first aid, and who has experience dealing with minor injuries, 
to help out as team trainer. Although all coaches should be trained in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and familiar with basic first aid,
having a trainer who’s skilled in these important areas is comforting —
not only to you, but also to the other parents. (Turn to Chapter 17 for
some information on treating common lacrosse injuries.)
69
Chapter 4: Parental Guidance: Meeting Your Players' Parents

 Trophy coordinator: Some leagues present a trophy to the first-place
team; others hand out participation trophies or certificates to all the
players; and some simply don’t have the financial resources to provide
anything extra. Depending on the type of league you’re coaching in, you
may want to consider assigning a trophy coordinator, who can arrange
to get small participation trophies or plaques to present to all the 
children at the end of the season.
 Game-day help: In beginner lacrosse programs, a couple of parents are
sometimes needed to help out on game day with tasks such as keeping
score or retrieving loose balls that go out of play. If your league needs
this sort of help (see Chapter 2 on the importance of knowing the
league’s rules), be sure to mention it during the parents’ meeting. Find
out which parents are willing to fill these positions, and write their
names down. You don’t want to be scrambling around minutes before
your game looking for parent volunteers when you could be spending
that time getting your team ready.
 Travel coordinator: This position is appropriate only for an older and
more-experienced team that competes against teams in other cities. (For
more on travel teams, check out Chapter 19.) This person tracks down
the most cost-effective and convenient hotels for the team to stay in,
and arranges a team bus or coordinates car pools for the road trip itself.
 Fund-raising coordinator: Sometimes, lacrosse teams rely on fund-raisers
to offset the cost of uniforms or to purchase new equipment. These
events can include everything from selling candy bars to washing cars,
and they require a lot of behind-the-scenes work to pull off. The job entails
determining what items to sell and the best location for doing so.
During your meeting, circulate a list of responsibilities that you need filled,
and have parents jot down their names next to the duties they’re comfortable
helping out with. If a large number of parents express interest in a specific
role, your best bet may be to have them work together as a committee so that
no parent is alienated. Or if no one signs up for a certain role, see whether 
a parent who signed up for another position would be willing to fill in 
there instead.
Meeting Players’ Special Needs
Taking on the role of a youth lacrosse coach means accepting responsibility for
working with kids of vastly different abilities. Some players are fast, and others
are slow. Some players are athletically gifted, and others have trouble keeping
their eye on the ball while they’re running down the field. You may also have a
child or two on your team who has special needs, such as a hearing or vision
70
Part I: Gearing Up to Coach Lacrosse 

problem or a learning disability. As a coach, you must provide opportunities to
all your players and do what you can to make the season fun for everyone.
(Head to Chapter 5 for a look at all the different types of kids you may be
coaching this season.)
During the parents’ meeting, be sure to find out whether any of the children
under your care have medical conditions that you need to be aware of and
whether any special accommodations need to be made for those conditions.
These can range from inhalers to insulin. Of course, make sure you take the
time to meet with the parents so that you clearly understand how to use
them, if the child needs assistance.
Understandably, parents may not feel comfortable divulging their children’s
medical information in front of all of the other parents, many of whom they
may not have met before. For that reason, you should set aside time at the
end of the meeting for one-on-one discussions in private. Also, let parents
know that they can contact you later to discuss anything.
Concluding Your Meeting with Q & A
Before wrapping up the meeting, you want to give parents a chance to ask
any questions that they may have. It’s perfectly okay if a lot of hands go up
during the question and answer session; that’s a good sign! It shows that the
parents are listening to what you’re saying and are deeply interested in their
kids’ well-being.
To ensure open dialogue, let parents know that no topic is off limits. The ques-
tion-and-answer session also allows parents who were hesitant to interrupt
your talk to pose their questions and get answers.
Also let parents know that if they’d feel more comfortable speaking with you
in private, you’ll be happy to hang around after the meeting to chat with
them (refer to “Meeting Players’ Special Needs” earlier in this chapter).
If you can’t answer any questions posed during your meeting, make a note of
them, and let the parents know that you’ll get back to them with answers as
soon as possible.
Remind parents that if they have any questions or concerns during the
season, you’ll be eager to speak with them in person, over the phone, or
through e-mail. Make sure, however, that they’re aware of the times that aren’t
conducive to productive discussions — such as before and after games and
practices, when your focus is on the kids and your other responsibilities.

T
he more lacrosse skills your players know how to perform — and can 
execute on game day while opponents are shadowing them and disrupting
them all over the field — the more enjoyment they will get out of the game.
Your many responsibilities include figuring out which skills your players have a
grasp of and which ones need attention, and then ensuring that you meet their
training needs. Not to worry — these tasks aren’t as daunting as they may
seem. This chapter has you covered.
Teaching Basic Lacrosse Skills
Lacrosse requires a broad range of skills. The following sections look at the
skills all beginning players need to know to make their first experience with
the sport a rewarding one.
Moving with the ball
Players who are unable to move with the ball are about as successful as sky-
divers without parachutes. A player’s ability to maneuver with the ball makes it
more difficult for defenders to stick with him; it also creates passing lanes he
can use to deliver the ball to teammates and opens up scoring opportunities.
The technique lacrosse players use to maneuver with the ball — simply
moving the stick side to side, up and down, or back and forth — is known as
the cradle. Using the cradle allows a player to keep the ball in his stick while
he’s running or fending off a check. (For more on the different types of cradles,
see Chapter 9.)

When running with the ball, a player should hold his stick in an upright posi-
tion (see Figure 5-1), with his dominant hand toward the top of the stick and
the other hand at the bottom of the stick. This stance allows him to pass or
shoot quickly. Many children tend to carry the ball at waist level while they’re
running, which takes away a lot of their effectiveness; they waste valuable
time in passing to an open teammate if they have to raise their stick before
releasing the ball.
Gaining control of the ball
Any time the ball is loose on the field, your team has an opportunity to gain
possession. You certainly don’t need a mathematics degree to figure out that
the more times your players scoop up loose balls, the more opportunities
they create for scoring goals. Teach your team the scoop method to corral
those balls while denying the opposition the chance to go on the attack.
Here’s how a player should pick up the ball:
1. She uses her dominant hand to grab the stick at its throat, which is
where the head and shaft come together.
Her opposite hand is at the end of the stick.
2. Keeping her feet shoulder width apart, she bends her knees while
lowering her stick to the ground (see Figure 5-2).
The head contacts the field while the shaft is as close to the ground as
possible. The handle is slightly below her knee. The lower the opposite
hand, the better. Ideally, a young player is scraping her knuckles along
the ground.
Figure 5-1:

their
effectiveness
on the run.
76
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

3. She drops the hand at the end of the stick almost parallel to the field
and uses a quick, scooping motion to slide the pocket under the ball.
Passing and receiving
For some players, passing the ball can be about as much fun as eating their
vegetables. But accurate passes and catches are much-needed elements of a
productive offensive unit that is difficult to defend against.
This section begins with the basics of executing a stationary pass and then
follows up on the technique for catching those passes. (For more details on
passing and catching on the run, flip to Chapter 9.)
Here’s how a player passes while standing still:
1. The passer stands with his feet about shoulder width apart.
His stance is similar to that of a player batting in a baseball game, with
his front shoulder facing the intended target.
2. He places his bottom hand on the end of the stick, holding it loosely
with his fingers.
3. He places his top hand just short of the midpoint of the stick, again
holding it loosely with his fingers.
4. He moves the stick over his back shoulder (see Figure 5-3).
5. His top hand moves the stick back so that the stick points at his target
while his weight shifts to his back foot.
6. He uses his top hand to bring the stick forward so that it is vertical
while taking a step forward with his right foot (see Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-2:
A player

balls.
77
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

He snaps the top wrist to get more force behind the pass while stepping
toward the target with his opposite foot. The motion is fundamentally the
same as throwing a ball, except that you are using both your dominant
and opposite hands.

78
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

7. His top arm should be fully extended, with the end of the stick facing
the target when the ball is released.
His upper body faces the target. In order to pass accurately, it is neces-
sary to swipe the top hand down the shaft. Not all the way to the bottom
hand, but enough that it allows your shoulder to rotate forward to face
the target. As the top hand rotates forward, the lower hand should be
held away from the midsection. This will allow the throw to have a great
trajectory and not end up on the ground in front of the player.
When the ball is on the way, here are the steps for catching it:
1. Just as she would for passing, the player places her bottom hand on
the end of the stick and her top hand slightly below the midpoint of
the shaft.
She holds the stick lightly in her fingers.
2. She holds the stick in a vertical position about a foot in front of her,
keeping it over her shoulder of her top hand with the pocket facing
the passer to create a clear target (see Figure 5-5).
For a right-handed passer, this target is over his right shoulder.
3. As the passer delivers the ball, she keeps her stick out in front of 
her body.
Figure 5-5:

Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

4. When the ball is about to reach the pocket, she pulls the stick back
slightly to help cushion the impact and receive the pass (see Figure 5-6).
Her stick should be in front of her shoulders when the ball makes contact
with the netting.
5. As the ball makes contact with the pocket, she relaxes her grip on the
stick with her top hand.
This maneuver helps cushion the impact so that the ball doesn’t bounce
out of the pocket.
Shooting
Without doubt, what the majority of kids love most about lacrosse is shoot-
ing the ball at the net. Scoring a goal off the shot is even more enjoyable. (For
details on teaching the more-advanced technique of shooting on the run,
check out Chapter 9.)
Here are the basics for executing a long overhand shot:
1. The shooter positions his feet shoulder width apart and bends his
knees.
His front foot is pointed at the net, and his weight is on his back foot,
which is parallel to the net.
2. He places his bottom hand on the end of the stick and the top hand
just below the midpoint of the stick.

At more-advanced levels, you can teach the player to drop his top hand
down the stick several inches, which will generate more power on 
the shot.
3. The player moves the head of the stick behind the plane of his shoul-
ders. It is similar to throwing a ball (see Figure 5-7).
4. He steps forward and shifts his weight to his front foot.
5. As he shifts his weight onto his opposite (and front) foot, he brings
both hands forward, snapping the top hand over the bottom hand.
Although shooting with the hands, arms, and shoulders, the center of
power is in the hips and legs. By stepping toward the target and shifting
his weight forward, he is using his entire body to accelerate his shot
(Figure 5-8).

6. He follows through on the shot, transferring all his weight to his front
foot.
The head points to the target.
Defending
Playing defense typically isn’t one of the first skills that young players practice.
Nonetheless, it is one of the most important parts of the game, especially 
considering that roughly half of every game, your team won’t have possession
of the ball and will be defending its goal.
One basic element of good defensive play is always being in proper position to
move in any direction in the blink of an eye. Teach your players the following
basic defensive stance:
1. She places her feet just beyond shoulder width apart, with her weight
on the balls of her feet, keeping her head up and her eyes on the
opponent’s midsection.
2. She flexes her knees and bends her back slightly (see Figure 5-9).
This stance puts her in prime position to move in any direction the
opposing player goes.
Checking
In some boys’ lacrosse leagues, checking is permitted. If your league allows it,
read on to see how it can be an effective technique for players to use.
The following are the basics of executing a check:
1. The defender takes the defensive position described in “Defending,”
earlier in this chapter.
2. With his head up and his eyes on his opponent’s midsection, he takes
a small step toward the opponent.
3. He leans slightly forward and, keeping both hands on his stick, raises
his arms to make contact with the opponent (see Figure 5-10).
He makes the hit short and hard, without fully extending his arms.
4. He pulls the stick back and resumes his defensive position.
82
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Goaltending
Manning this position requires a unique set of skills, many of which are vastly
different from any of the others you’ll be teaching your players. Whenever the
opponent has the ball in the defensive zone, you want your goalie ready to
move in any direction to defend a shot. Following is the basic ready stance you
should teach (for more information on stopping shots, jump to Chapter 10):
1. The goalie places her feet shoulder width apart and her knees slightly
bent, with her weight on the balls of her feet.
Figure 5-10:

2. She keeps her head up and her eyes on the offensive player who’s
handling the ball.
3. He holds the stick above the shoulder of his dominant hand.
Because of the quick reflexes required by a goalie, both his hands are in
front of his body (Figure 5-11).
4. To stay in the center of the goal, the goalie will use the end of the
shaft to tap the goal posts to locate himself properly.
By doing so, he never leaves a large portion of the goal open to his 
opponents.
Sizing Up the Players
When you receive a job promotion and find yourself in charge of a staff, one
of the first things you do is examine the skills of your employees and deter-
mine whose talents fit best where. If you don’t, you probably won’t be too
successful in your new position. The same principle applies to coaching
lacrosse. To maximize your effectiveness and push your players to reach
their potential, you must be proficient in the art of evaluating skills.
Figure 5-11:

84
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Most leagues hand a group of kids over to you with no indication of how tal-
ented they are or what their strengths or weaknesses may be, so be prepared
to begin evaluating your players the first time you get together with them.
(For information on evaluating players during competitive travel-team try-
outs, check out Chapter 19.)
Evaluating skills
If you don’t know what you’re looking for, evaluating young lacrosse players
can be challenging. After all, lacrosse is a complex sport that requires a wide
range of individual skills and the ability to use them in a manner that benefits
the team. Being able to assess a player’s strengths and weaknesses properly
is essential for determining which areas of his game need additional work and
what you can do to remedy any difficulties he’s having.
Although evaluating players is critical all season long, it takes on added
importance during the first few practices of the season. You risk frustrating
your developing players if you evaluate them improperly, and they risk injury
if you force them into exercises that are too difficult for their skill level. Take
the time to evaluate all players properly at the beginning; then help them
strengthen the areas of their game that are lacking.
Small-sided scrimmages work really well for evaluating younger players’
skills. (If your league plays regulation games, chop the games down to five-
on-five, for example.) Because the players get to touch the ball a lot and
handle it in a variety of offensive and defensive roles, you can see how they
handle all sorts of situations in a short period.
Identifying players’ strengths 
and weaknesses
The better you understand your players’ strengths and weaknesses, the more
effective practices you’ll be able to put together. When you recognize areas of
the game that your team doesn’t perform quite as well as others, you can
attack those areas enthusiastically with specific drills during your practices.
But don’t neglect the parts of the game that the team is strong in; you still
need to run drills in those areas to keep the players sharp. (See Chapter 13 for
more details on making midseason adjustments to account for your team’s
improving skills.)
The following sections give you some pointers to keep in mind while evaluating
players.
85
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

Don’t focus all your attention on players’ ability to score goals. A player may be
proficient in the shooting department, but shooting skill doesn’t necessarily
mean that she’s a well-developed, all-around player. Perhaps her teammates are
great passers who are always able to feed her the ball when she’s open, or
maybe she has more strength than some of the other kids, which makes her
shots more difficult to stop. Also, if her offensive skills are especially well
developed, she may have defensive deficiencies.
Mobility
Lacrosse is a game of constant motion, on both offense and defense, and
active feet are paramount for productive participation. Players who are flat-
footed or who tend to stand still on the field are less likely to take advantage
of opportunities to attack when their team regains possession of the ball.
Also, they may be a defensive liability when their team turns the ball over
and they’re suddenly required to defend.
When evaluating a player’s movement, take several factors into account to
get a true sense of his ability in this area of the game:
 Is he involved in all facets of the game?
 After he delivers a shot on goal, does he stand there and admire his
shot, or does he move forward aggressively in case the ball rebounds or
the goalie misplays it?
 When he makes a pass to a teammate, does he become a statue immedi-
ately afterward, watching to see whether the ball reaches the intended
target?
 When he doesn’t have the ball, does he look to get open to receive a pass,
or does he turn into a spectator and watch his teammates continue 
the attack?
Response to defensive pressure
How a player responds when a defender closes in on her makes a big differ-
ence in her game-day productivity. Look for these traits:
 Can she weave through defenders and get off a pass or shot?
 When she receives a pass, does she look to attack and create opportuni-
ties for herself or his teammates, or is she more comfortable getting rid
of the ball quickly so that she doesn’t have to deal with a defender in 
her face?
 Boys’ lacrosse only: Can he hang on to the ball when he’s being checked
by the opponent’s stick or is otherwise forced to deal with body contact?
86
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Offensive ability
At advanced levels of youth lacrosse, in which players are strong, fast, and
skilled, the ability to beat opponents one-on-one is critical for your team’s
success. Look for these traits in a player:
 Does he have the skills to negotiate past a defender and get a quality
shot on goal?
 Can he make both short and long passes?
 Is he effective delivering shots on goal either while stationary or on 
the move?
 Are his shots difficult for the goalie to stop?
Defensive tenacity
One of the best indicators of a well-rounded lacrosse player is her ability to
excel both offensively and defensively. A one-dimensional player who’s good
only moving with the ball — and not very effective defending a player who
has it — is a liability that other teams will take advantage of, especially at
advanced levels of play. Continually work to make your players tenacious
defenders who make it difficult for the opposition to maneuver the ball. (Turn
to Chapter 10 for the rundown on defensive fundamentals.) Keep an eye out
for these traits:
 Does she pursue loose balls with enthusiasm?
 When an opponent maneuvers past her does she try to recover quickly
and chase down the player?
 Does she try to keep opponents out of the middle of the field when they
near her team’s net?
Mindset
How much impact a player has on the game is influenced, to a great extent,
by his mindset. Look for these traits:
 Does he give you his best effort at all times?
 When a play doesn’t turn out the way he expected, does he drop his
head, run slower, or act frustrated?
 How well does he handle constructive criticism and suggestions for
improving his level of play?
Influence on the team
What type of teammate a child is speaks volumes about what type of player
she is. Look for these traits:
87
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

 Is she a positive influence on the squad?
 Does she pump her teammates up with words of encouragement when
the team is struggling to score goals?
 Is she enthusiastic regardless of the score in the game?
 When she isn’t in the game, is she vocal in her support of her teammates?
Choosing a Starting Lineup
As a youth lacrosse coach, you’ll face more questions throughout the season
than a contestant on “Jeopardy!” One of the biggest ones is determining who
fills which positions on game day. At beginning levels of lacrosse, positioning
players isn’t terribly important, because your main goal is introducing kids to
the sport and its most basic components. At more-advanced levels of play,
choosing positions takes on more prominence, because fitting kids into the
right positions affects how the team performs.
Never typecast players based on their physical appearance. Children who are
slightly overweight, for example, are often delegated to play goalie because
goalies aren’t required to run around much. They may not even be considered
for attacker positions because they don’t look like players who can maneuver
with the ball all over the field, sprint or pivot past defenders, and create 
scoring opportunities for the team. A child who gets typecast in one position
early may never fully enjoy the experience of playing lacrosse. You may have a
wonderfully skilled player just waiting to emerge, but if you don’t give him the
chance to play different positions, he’ll never know how successful he could
have been, and he may miss out on a rewarding, enriching experience.
88
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 
Transferring practice skills to game play
Some kids perform well during practice but are
unable to bring those skills to the field on game
day. You may have a truly gifted attacker who hap-
pens to be an incredible passer, for example, but
when game day arrives, he’s unable to get the ball
to open teammates and often surrenders the ball
to the opposition. His impressive practice skills
are gone, just like a rabbit disappearing from a
magician’s hat.
By watching him carefully, you may discover that
problems arise as soon as a defender begins to
close in on him. If you work with this player on
some one-on-one moves (see Chapter 11 for
some techniques you can teach your players) and
get him comfortable having a defender in front of
him all the time, his skills will improve, and you’ll
see him emerge as a more effective performer on
game day.

Assigning positions
As players gain experience in and knowledge about the game, you need to
determine the positions that not only fit their particular skills, but also benefit
the team.
When positioning your players, take these factors into account:
 The positions you need to fill
 The skills needed to play those positions successfully
 The responsibilities that come with each position
 The types of kids who are best suited for handling the various positions
When assigning positions, remind each player that you chose her for that
position because of her special skills and the ability she demonstrates in
practice. As the season progresses, however, you may recognize that a player
is better suited for another position. Flip to Chapter 13 for more information
on making midseason adjustments to benefit the team.
Any child is capable of playing, enjoying, and excelling at any position on the
field, but keep some general characteristics in mind when determining who
plays where when you start dealing with older, more-experienced teams. The
following sections describe the skills needed to excel in different positions.
Goalies
Goalie is a challenging position to play, simply because of all the different
types of shots that come the goalie’s way — many at high rates of speed.
Often, it is the goalie who is the best athlete on the field. Because stopping all
the shots is impossible, you need a youngster in the net who doesn’t get
down on himself easily. Look for these traits:
 Mental strength and confidence, and the ability to bounce back after 
surrendering a goal
 Excellent hand–eye coordination
 Quick reflexes
 Ability to stay focused on the game
 Good communication skills (important for a goalie, because he can let
teammates in front of him know what is unfolding and thereby help 
eliminate some defensive breakdowns)
Attackers
This position requires players with these traits:
89
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

 Strong shooting and passing skills
 Ability to make sharp cuts to get away from defenders
 Proficiency with the stick and with both hands
 Good vision of the field to find open teammates and get them the ball
 In boys’ lacrosse leagues in which checking is allowed, enough physical
strength to absorb the contact from defenders’ checks
Midfielders
Midfielders should have these traits:
 Stamina: This position requires the most running on the field, so mid-
fielders must have the stamina to handle their responsibilities.
 Versatility: Midfielders must be able to play both offense and defense,
and must be able to make the switch from one role to the other quickly.
 Speed: Because of the fast-paced nature of lacrosse, teams with strong
midfielders who can move down the field quickly get some good scoring
chances with an extra-player advantage at the offensive end of the field.
 Fast reactions: Midfielders who can react to plays and scamper back 
on defense when play calls for it can help deny the opposition a good
scoring chance.
Defenders
This position is a challenging one because defensemen don’t know what the
opponent is planning to do. The position requires the following traits:
 Ability to read and react quickly to opponents’ moves
 Aggressiveness and agility
 Tenacity to recover and get back into the play when an opponent 
gets past
 In boys’ leagues that allow checking, good footwork so that the player 
is always in proper position to apply a check
Soothing disappointed players
Regardless of how carefully you choose positions for your players, you’re
going to have kids who aren’t content with where you have lined them up.
Now what do you do?
If you are working with beginning-level players, you can ease the disappoint-
ment by reminding them that everyone will have the opportunity to play
each position at some point in the season. In the meantime, use this situation
90
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

as an opportunity to begin teaching them the essence of teamwork. Point out
that for the team to work as a cohesive unit and enjoy success, everyone will
have to make sacrifices throughout the season. Not everyone can be an
attacker all the time; some players have to fill defensive positions, which are
extremely important.
One approach you can take to help kids get over the disappointment of not
playing the positions they wanted is to take a team field trip to a high school,
college, or professional lacrosse game in your area. If that isn’t an option
where you live, gather the team to watch a televised game on ESPN. These
contests can be outstanding learning experiences for the entire team. Instruct
your team to monitor the athletes who play their positions. Having a young-
ster watch how a player at a more elite level of competition plays the same
position will give her a better sense of the position’s importance to the over-
all structure of the team. She may even pick up a few pointers along the way.
Working with All Kinds of Kids
Whether you’re coaching a beginning team of 6-year-olds or an experienced
team of 14-year-olds, you’re embarking on a pretty cool adventure filled with
challenges to your creativity and patience — one that will test your ability to
communicate with all types of personalities and skill levels.
Youngsters’ athletic talents, physical development, and emotional characteris-
tics cover a wide spectrum. How you handle all these different types of kids
plays a large role in determining how much fun they have playing for you and
whether they want to return next season.
Average players
Most of the kids you’ll come into contact with are regular, everyday kids —
which means that some of them will have short attention spans. Here’s a
glimpse at what to expect when working with these kids.
The average child
Average children are players who enjoy playing lacrosse, running up and down
the field, and being with their friends. They’ll never play college lacrosse, but
they’ll be content to play for you, learn from you, and improve as players under
your guidance and instruction. Some of these kids, through their involvement
with you this season, will develop a real love and passion for the game and will
continue playing it for years to come. Others will be content to try a new sport
next season but will have a handle on the basics of lacrosse if they ever choose
to return to the sport in the future.
91
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

The inattentive child
The younger the child, the shorter his attention span is likely to be. Because
lacrosse is an outdoor sport, distractions abound — from planes in the sky to
cars honking in the street. You have to compete with all sorts of things that
are vying for your players’ attention, so you have a greater responsibility to
run practices that grab the kids’ attention and keep their interest and excite-
ment levels high. If you spend most of practice talking rather than letting the
kids run around on the field, you’ll drain their interest. (See Chapter 6 for tips
on making your practices fun.)
Fearful players
Harboring fears is natural for children, but how you go about helping them
overcome those fears makes a big difference. Following are some of the most
common fears and what you can do to erase them.
The child who is afraid of getting hurt
Any time kids are involved in a contact sport like lacrosse, some of them are
bound to be afraid of taking a check (in boys’ leagues), getting knocked to the
ground, or even suffering an injury. Who can blame them? Getting whacked
with a stick or having a shot ricochet off a body part is about as much fun as
getting shots at the doctor’s office.
Kids need to know that assorted bumps and bruises are going to occur from
time to time, but they can’t allow minor injuries to chase them away from
playing a sport they otherwise enjoy. Talk to them about skinning a knee on
the playground: Although it hurts at the time, it doesn’t stop them from play-
ing with their friends. Encourage your players to use the same approach with
lacrosse. Help them accept the fact that sometimes, things happen on the field
that result in pain or discomfort, but the pain is usually momentary, and they
shouldn’t let it detract from their fun. (See Chapter 17 for ways to keep your
players healthy and minimize any hurt.)
The child who is shy
Shyness is as common in lacrosse as grass-stained uniforms, yet it can be one
of the easiest problems to handle, as long as you’re patient and gradually
work to lure the child out of her protective shell. Be aware that pushing too
hard and too early in the season may scare her enough that she actually pulls
back and further isolates herself from the team.
Shy children often go to extreme lengths to blend into the background and
dodge attention. During practices, they avoid eye contact; they don’t ask for
help when working on skills; and they quietly move throughout the various
drills while doing everything in their power not to draw attention to 
themselves.
92
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

One way to help shy players is to rotate the kids who lead the calisthenics
and stretching at the beginning of practice sessions. Select a shy child along
with a couple of other players to lead the warm-up. This selection is a small
step toward helping the shy youngster become comfortable in front of the
team. Because other players are up there with him, he won’t feel isolated or
gripped with fear that all eyes are on him.
After a shy child does something well during team exercises, give her a pat on
the back. She may not enjoy a verbal acknowledgment from you that draws
attention from other team members, but small acts that go unnoticed by
everyone else can make a big impact on this child and slowly draw her out.
Lacrosse is a contact sport, so the possibility always exists that a child may
get knocked around or suffer a minor injury, that momentarily takes away a
little bit of their enthusiasm for participating. Perhaps the child was whacked
with an opponent’s stick, or took a hard fall to the ground because he was
tripped. Whatever the reason for his reluctance to go back on the field, when
you call upon him during a game, never embarrass the youngster or force
him back out there against his will. If the child isn’t comfortable explaining
why he’s hesitant to return at the time, be sure to speak with him privately
after the game to learn what happened and what you can do to ease those
fears before the next game. Of course, share your conversation with his 
parents, too. They need to know what happened and why their child didn’t
play his normal amount of minutes.
The child who doesn’t want to be there
Youngsters with low or nonexistent self-esteem typically don’t fare well in
athletic endeavors, so they tend to avoid participation. A child who doesn’t
want to be there may have written off having fun playing lacrosse for any
number of reasons:
 He watched an older sibling play lacrosse and felt that lacrosse players
are pressured to excel.
 Even though he doesn’t want any part of lacrosse, his parents signed
him up anyway.
 He’s already played lacrosse for several years, has grown tired of the
sport, and simply needs a break.
 He has his eye on another sport.
Talk to the child to find out the reason for his lack of interest. You can
address many of his concerns, take care of and comfort him, and restore his
interest in playing again. Connecting with the child emotionally and helping
him solve his dilemma can do wonders in reestablishing his enthusiasm
about lacrosse.
93
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

Fearsome players
Some players on your team may present more challenges than you expected,
and we’re not referring to teaching them how to hold their sticks or defend
an attacking player. Some kids display bullying tendencies or hog the ball,
and you must deal with them to ensure that the entire team’s experience isn’t
compromised.
You’ll also be challenged in a different way if you coach supertalented chil-
dren. The following sections look at how to handle all these types of kids.
The bullying child
Most of us had the unpleasant experience of dealing with a bully at some
point during childhood. Whether they turn up on the school playground, in
the neighborhood, or during an organized sports program, bullies have a way
of making life miserable for those on their radar.
Bullies can also show up on the lacrosse field, ready to torment, tease, and
create trouble. These children thrive on attention and find pleasure in upset-
ting others, usually because of their own insecurities. The lacrosse field has
no room for bullies and their intimidating tactics.
Most kids who are being tormented by a bully don’t complain for fear of
making the situation even worse. You’ve got to keep a close eye on interac-
tions among your players — not just during practice, but also before and
after practice — because bullies wreak the most havoc when adults aren’t
able to supervise everything that’s going on.
If you’re having problems with a child who’s bullying others, speak with her
away from the team, and let her know that she must change her behavior. Let
her know that you admire her tenacity on the field, but that she must use it
only during the course of play. If the child is picking on or making fun of her
teammates, remind her that she should be encouraging and supporting them
instead.
Never allow a player to use his stick as a weapon to intimidate or harm others.
Children who use their sticks to bully must face immediate and serious reper-
cussions because a teammate’s safety should never be compromised.
The child who hogs the ball
Ball hogs — players who seem allergic to passing and refuse to give the ball
up, even to wide-open teammates in prime scoring position — can create real
problems, because their behavior directly affects everyone’s enjoyment of the
game. Ball hogs typically aren’t problems at the younger age levels, because
most kids haven’t developed their skills to the point that they can maintain
control of the ball for extended periods. The problem generally occurs when
94
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

kids begin to develop skills, their talent begins to shine through, and they 
realize that they’re pretty good.
A player can earn the ball-hog label for several reasons, all of which you can
help him discard by taking the right approach. The player may be
 Unaware: Quite often, the child isn’t aware that he’s hanging on to the
ball longer than he should be. Relying on practice drills that stress pass-
ing, or scrimmages in which the team must complete a set number of
passes in a row before taking a shot on goal, is one approach to erasing
ball-hog problems.
 Dealing with conflicting instructions: A challenging scenario occurs
when the child receives conflicting instructions from Dad or Mom at
home. The parent may tell the child that he needs to exert more control
and dominate the game, and that he shouldn’t relinquish the ball so
often. If you suspect that this situation is happening, have a quick meet-
ing with the parents; remind them that you would appreciate their help
in reinforcing at home what you are teaching in practice. 
 Unfamiliar with the sport: The child may be new to participating in
organized team sports or simply unfamiliar with lacrosse. He may
require a little time to become accustomed to the team setting and to
see how passing the ball fits into the team concept of working to create
the best scoring opportunities.
 Following your lead: Ask yourself whether you are guilty of allowing
kids to hang on to the ball too long without saying anything about it.
Stress the importance of teamwork during practice, and point out to
players who show a tendency to hang on to the ball too long that they
should have passed it to a teammate.
 Ready for a chat about his future in the game: The player may have
aspirations of playing at a higher and more-competitive level of lacrosse.
Let him know that when he begins playing at more-competitive levels, the
players he’ll go up against will have the same skills that he does — and
perhaps more skills, which will make his ability to distribute the ball to
teammates even more important. Talk to him about being a well-rounded
player who can not only handle the ball deftly and score goals, but also
thread accurate passes through a maze of defenders.
When you notice a child hanging on to the ball a bit too long, don’t embarrass
her, because you risk making her suddenly afraid to take any shots or carry
the ball for any length of time for fear of being reprimanded again. A ball hog
doesn’t need to be disciplined; she simply needs coaching and guidance on
how to work more effectively within the framework of the team.
Athletically gifted
The athletically gifted player stands out. His teammates know he’s the best
player, and all the parents recognize his talents too.
95
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

When coaching a youngster who’s far superior in skill development, be aware
that you must provide challenges for him in your drills that allow him to
enhance his skills without compromising the rest of the team in the process.
This balancing act can be tricky at times; you don’t want to isolate the player
from his teammates, but you also don’t want him to be bored and unchal-
lenged performing a drill that he’s already good at (but that the rest of the
team is just learning). Rely on your creativity to concoct clever ways to help
both the kids who are just learning a skill and the talented players excel at
the same time.
If you’re working with the team on taking shots on goal, and you’re serving 
as the defender in the drill, you can make minor adjustments to ensure that
every player benefits, regardless of skill level. For youngsters who are just
learning to deal with an opposing player in front of them, you can remain sta-
tionary so that they can take a step around you and have a clear shot on net.
For more experienced kids, you can easily increase the difficulty of the drill
to challenge them more by stick checking them (in boys’ leagues) or taking
an extra step in the direction in which they are moving to make getting off 
a shot more difficult. Using a little ingenuity can make a big difference in 
meeting all the kids’ needs.
It’s easy to fall into the habit of piling the praise on those players who contin-
ually put a smile on your face with their offensive and defensive skills. Keep
yourself in check and refrain from going overboard with the superlatives,
because overdoing it can have adverse effects:
 Some kids may begin feeling unnecessary pressure, which can inhibit
their performance and smother their fun with lacrosse. They may feel
that with all the attention being thrown in their direction, they have to
shoulder more of the responsibility for the team’s success and failure. If
they don’t score a certain number of goals, they may feel personally
responsible for a loss.
 Going overboard with the praise can also alienate other members of 
the team who may begin to feel as though the talented player is your
favorite. If you allow this alienation to happen, the team will harbor
resentment toward you and the talented player, and that causes prob-
lems with the team spirit and chemistry you’re trying to build.
There is certainly nothing wrong with enjoying coaching talented players
(though hopefully you derive equal pleasure working with all the kids). In
fact, if these players possess good attitudes, and aren’t critical or conde-
scending to their teammates, they have the potential to emerge as wonderful
team leaders and positive role models. Just remember to maintain a proper
perspective and that they are just one piece of the team puzzle. The entire
roster is counting on you for your help, support, and guidance as well.

Players who need extra help
A big part of coaching lacrosse is meeting challenges head on and helping
youngsters who are encountering difficulties develop their skills and see
improvement in their play. The following sections discuss some of these
types of kids.
The inexperienced child
Some players get a late start in lacrosse. Your entire team may have been
playing for several years except for one child who is giving the game a shot
this season. With the relatively short amount of contact you’ll have with her
this season, helping her get caught up to the skill level of her teammates
simply won’t be possible unless she’s an exceptional athlete. But you can still
help her become a contributing member of the team.
Try to gauge whether the youngster is uncomfortable knowing that she’s lag-
ging in many skills because of her inexperience. If you sense that she isn’t
bothered by it, you may want to work with her one-on-one for a few minutes
before or after practices if she is interested.
You want to be sure that the inexperienced player fully understands proper
techniques before you insert her into drills. Otherwise, she could pose an
injury risk to another player or even to herself.
The uncoordinated child
Coordination takes time to develop, so many children are challenged in this
area, particularly at beginning levels of play. They’re adjusting to their grow-
ing bodies, and some of the movements required for playing lacrosse may
seem unnatural to them. Uncoordinated children struggle with some of the
most basic lacrosse skills, and simply catching a pass or running downfield
with the ball can present challenges for them. Regardless, these kids are
trying their very best. Be aware that they can become enormously frustrated;
feelings of inadequacy can settle in and further compromise their experience.
Helping a child improve his coordination takes practice, but if you stick with
it, you can make a positive difference. Here are some points to keep in mind
when coaching these players:
 Camouflage any frustration. The uncoordinated won’t pick up what
you’re teaching as quickly as a lot of their teammates will, so make sure
that you don’t reveal frustration in your words or body language. Never
give uncoordinated players any reason to think that you’re disappointed
in them.
 Be supportive. Players who are handcuffed by coordination difficulties
won’t be too enthusiastic about stepping onto the field on game day.
They’re afraid that they’ll struggle, disappoint their teammates, or
97
Chapter 5: Managing Your Team

embarrass themselves. Be constantly supportive of their efforts,
because when they see their friends performing at a level they believe
they can never reach, they may become disenchanted with lacrosse and
reluctant to continue participating.
 Encourage parental assistance. Get the parents involved. They can help
an uncoordinated child simply by passing the ball back and forth to him
at home for a few minutes a couple of times a week. That way, the child
won’t have to worry about teammates watching him. Just be sure to have
the parents stress having a good time over how well the child is perform-
ing the skill. Also make sure that parents don’t overdo the 
sessions at home.
The child with special needs
All kids have a legal right to participate in lacrosse, including those who have
special needs — which may range from hearing loss and vision impairment to
medical conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy. Youngsters who have
physical conditions that don’t give them full use of their arms or legs also fall
into this category.
As a volunteer lacrosse coach, you’re likely to question your qualifications to
work with these kids. But remember — you’re a coach, and these kids are
looking for your help and guidance just like everyone else on the team.
If you have a child with special needs, set aside some time before the first prac-
tice of the season to talk to the family about their hopes and expectations for
their child’s participation. Keep in mind that this season may be the parents’
first foray into organized sports, and they may be nervous and apprehensive
about having their child participate. Explore the endless possibilities. Figure
out ways that the youngster can be included and can be a valued and con-
tributing member of the team.
If a child has a visual impairment and has difficulty seeing the ball, perhaps
playing with a different-colored ball would make a difference without compro-
mising anyone’s safety or enjoyment of the game.
If you’re coaching a team of older kids, ask them for their thoughts and ideas.
They can be great resources for you, and they may just surprise you with
their creative suggestions on how to ensure that their teammate is part of the
action.
Regardless of the age or skill level of your team, having a child with special
needs on the squad can be enormously beneficial for your other players.
Youngsters get a firsthand lesson in developing understanding, compassion,
and patience for their teammates, as well as in accepting everyone’s 
differences.

Conducting Fun-Filled Practices
In This Chapter
 Making your first practice a hit
 Putting together fun and creative practices
 Making your practices beneficial
 Ending practices on a high note
O
ne of the many secrets of being a successful lacrosse coach is conduct-
ing practices that the kids look forward to, week after week, as much as
they look forward to sleepovers with their friends and trips to the toy store.
As long as you’re able to keep the excitement and enthusiasm running high
during these sessions, nonstop fun, learning, and skill development follow.
In this chapter, we run down all the elements for pulling off practices that
challenge, entertain, and motivate children. We cover how to charge out of
the starting blocks strong, setting a positive tone for the season with a great
first practice. We discuss how to conduct fun and effective practices each
time you get together with the kids, how to squeeze the most out of every
minute, and how to help players overcome difficulties in learning new 
techniques. We also devote a section to the importance of concluding your
practices on a positive note.
Beginning the Season: First Practice
You may have had pretty nerve-wracking experiences with “first times” — 
the first time you rode a roller coaster, went on an airplane, or asked some-
one out on a date, for example. You don’t need to include conducting your
first lacrosse practice in that list, though.
Sure, if you’ve never coached a youth lacrosse team before, you may get
sweaty palms just thinking about how you’re going to handle all the kids.
Being a little nervous is only natural, because you have a lot at stake when
you step on the field to practice for the first time. The first impression you

make sets the tone for the season and provides your kids a good indication of
what’s in store. But not to worry — we’re here to guide you and to minimize
any stress you may be feeling if this first practice is weighing on your mind.
The following sections explain how you should greet your team, introduce all
the players and coaches, and run the remainder of your initial practice. 
Good luck!
Making a great first impression
First impressions are important, whether you’re interviewing for a job or
greeting your players for the first practice of the season. Establishing positive
contact with the kids before they take a shot or catch a pass helps put them
at ease and signals that they can expect a rewarding season.
Here are some tips to help you score big with your team at your first meeting:
 Get there early. Make sure you’re the first person at the field. Being there
ahead of time so that you can greet each player as he arrives sends a posi-
tive message that you’re enthusiastic about getting started. If you pull up
a few minutes before practice is supposed to start, and some players are
already there, you give the impression that you’re disorganized, too busy,
and unprepared for all the responsibilities that coaching lacrosse entails.
 Put the kids at ease. A lot of youngsters are probably going to be a little
nervous, so a friendly smile and warm greeting can go a long way toward
squashing those jitters. Starting something new when you don’t know a
single person is uncomfortable for everyone. You don’t want a child to
stand off to the side, wondering whether she’s at the right field. The
more relaxing you can make the atmosphere, the more enthusiastic the
kids will be about getting started.
 Get the conversations flowing. Begin establishing bonds with the kids
right away. If time allows, talk briefly with the players as they arrive to find
out a little bit more about them. Just keep the conversations general in
nature and not too probing. Asking questions such as how long they’ve
played lacrosse or what positions they’ve played in the past can help
alleviate some of that first-practice stress. Taking a genuine interest in
your players — which they’ll recognize and appreciate — is the founda-
tion for forging special relationships with them that can carry on
throughout the season.
Coach and player introductions
You should start the first practice by formally introducing yourself and any
assistant coaches you have. During your intro, share some tidbits about your-
self, including the following:
100
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Whether you prefer being called “Coach,” “Coach Jeff,” or any other
moniker (such as a funny nickname that will get a chuckle out of the kids)
 How long you’ve coached (or played) lacrosse and where
 Whether one of your own children is on the team
After introducing yourself and any assistants, ask each child to say her name.
You want to keep the player introductions short and to the point. Some kids
are going to be overly shy, and the last thing you want to do is traumatize
them before practice has even begun.
You may have more than a dozen kids on your team, which makes learning all
their names a little challenging. Giving each player a name tag to wear during
the first practice or two speeds the process. Slap a name tag on yourself and
on your assistant coaches so that the kids know you’re all in this together.
Team bonding can’t start too early!
The skills to focus on first
Well before the first practice, you should know what drills you want to begin
with and how those drills will lead into the more intensive practices to come.
It’s a good idea to keep a practice notebook where you log all the drills you
use and make notes on which ones the kids really like and that achieve the
results you are looking for, as well as those that flop and shouldn’t be used
anymore. For the scoop on some basic drills for beginners, flip to Chapter 7.
If you’re looking to upgrade your drills, Chapter 14 offers some advanced
ones to incorporate into your practices.
If you’re coaching a beginning-level team, chances are that many of your kids
have never played lacrosse (or any other organized sport, for that matter).
Because of the somewhat complex nature of the game — from the fundamen-
tals of holding the stick for passing and catching to defending an attacking
player — your best bet is to ease into the first practice by focusing on some
basic skills, such as maintaining possession of the ball while moving.
Using the first couple of practices to cover fundamental skills establishes a
solid foundation that you can build on throughout the season without over-
whelming your players in the process.
If you’re coaching players who have a little more experience, you can use the
first week of practices simply to refresh them on the basics. Use the first
couple of practices to evaluate your players individually and your team’s
strengths and weaknesses overall (see Chapter 5). You can cover the most
basic elements quickly, but then you should move on to more-advanced tech-
niques, such as executing shots and passes while on the move with a defender
guarding them closely. In subsequent practices, you can include other
advanced skills, techniques, and strategies to help your players upgrade their
level of play.
101
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

When one of your players arrives late, don’t immediately send her into the
drill that is taking place. This rule is especially important for an older player
who hasn’t gone through the proper stretching and warm-ups that the rest of
the team completed. Instead, have her work on an aspect of the game that
can be done along the sideline to help get her loosened up before she steps
on the field and goes full speed during the practice. Perhaps some light run-
ning while holding the ball if she’s a beginner, or working on pivoting with the
ball (check out Chapter 11 for more details on executing this move) if she’s
an advanced-level player. If you’re coaching a team of older players who are
more susceptible to muscle strains and pulls, make sure the late player goes
through proper stretching before you allow her on the field. Just because a
player is late doesn’t mean that she can overlook this important aspect of the
game. You don’t want to put her at unnecessary risk of suffering an injury
that could have been avoided.
Making practice a pleasure
Every day at school plays an important role in helping a child learn and
develop, and the same applies to your lacrosse practices, which is why plan-
ning them is so important. Simply planning a practice isn’t enough, however:
You also have to follow through with successful execution.
Because you may have a dozen or so kids on your team, making sure that
every player benefits from your practices can be quite a challenge. This 
section provides some tips that you can use to turn all your practices into
fun-filled, dynamic sessions.
Revving up the warm-ups
When you’re able to set a fun tone while the kids are stretching and getting
loose for the practice, that helps them transition into your drills and creates
a relaxed atmosphere that’s conducive to learning — and having an enjoyable
day of lacrosse. While they are loosening up, pick a number between 1 and
100 and then go around the group and have each player pick a number. The
one who picks closest to yours gets to choose a practice drill that the team
will run that day. Or, you could make that youngster the honorary team 
captain for the day, where she gets to lead off each drill, or has some other
special privilege. By making the stretching period exciting you’ll grab the
players’ interest the moment they take the field.
Starting and ending with fun drills
A little creative thinking on your part is all you need to open and close your
practices in a positive fashion. If you’re coaching a beginning-level team, for
example, a fun way to start your practices is to give each player a ball, which
102
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

he must carry in his stick while trying to run around the field and tag you.
(See Chapter 7 for some more drills you can use with younger kids.)
If you’re coaching older kids, you can pair them up and give each twosome a
ball. Start the players in each pair about 15 yards apart, and have them jog
down the field, passing the ball back and forth. This drill also helps loosen up
the players and gets their hearts pumping so that they’re ready to participate
in practice.
One way you can close practice is to get the parents involved (see “Putting
parents on the field,” later in this chapter). You can also use scrimmages to
end things on a high note (see “Picking the right times for scrimmages” 
section later in this chapter.)
Putting parents on the field
Your players’ parents can be much more than just chauffeurs to practices and
games. Your players (especially at the younger age levels) will get a kick out of
having their parents on the field with them. Getting involved in practice will
also be fun for the parents — much more so than sitting on the sidelines
watching drills, we’re sure.
You can involve as many interested parents as you want in your practices.
Here are some ways you can bring them in:
 Give them notice. Let the parents know well in advance that you’d like
to involve them in a practice. Give them options for dates and times. If
you give busy parents time to plan, they’ll likely be happy to join in.
 Stir up excitement. Set a fun tone for the practice involving the parents by
talking about it to your players during the preceding practice. Be enthusi-
astic about the drills you have planned, and show your excitement about
the adventure, so that the players will be equally pumped up to have Mom
or Dad sweating on the field with them.
 Set up a parent–child scrimmage. The kids will really love seeing their
mom playing goalie or their dad trying to stop them on the attack. You
can play a quick game at the end of practice to conclude the day on a
fun note, or you can devote a midseason practice to the scrimmage as 
a nice break from routine.
 Pair kids and parents in drills. Parents can help you liven up a routine
drill. You can run a one-on-one drill, for example, in which the child has
to go against her parent and try to break free to deliver a shot on net.
Then have the parent try to beat her child with a move to get open. The
kids will love the challenge of going against Dad or Mom.
103
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

Coming to practice prepared
Your players need come to practice prepared, and so do you. You should
have your practice plan ready the day before practice, along with the drills
you want to run and how much time you plan to allot to each activity.
Your preparation should also include a properly stocked first-aid kit, which is
a must for running a safe practice. (Check out Chapter 17 for more information
on recognizing and treating player injuries.)
Bringing balls and other equipment
One basic rule for running a quality lacrosse practice is that you can never
have too many balls. The more balls you have, the less practice time is wasted
retrieving them or forcing players to wait to run a drill until a ball is available
for them. You can make it a team rule that each child must bring a ball to prac-
tice. Just have each player put his initials on his ball so that he can take it
home afterward.
If the program you are coaching in doesn’t provide a lot of practice equipment,
check with your local sporting-goods store about purchasing some new or
even used balls.
Nothing sabotages a practice quicker than players arriving without the proper
equipment. During your preseason parents’ meeting (covered in Chapter 4),
emphasize what kids are responsible for bringing to the field.
104
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 
Putting sedentary parents in the game
Not every parent is going to want — or be able —
to participate in practices. Some parents have
busy schedules that don’t allow them to hang
around for practices; others have physical prob-
lems that prevent them from running around. And
some kids, for whatever reason, may not want
their parents involved. That’s OK, because having
even a few parents involved gives your practice a
different look and the kids another type of drill to
participate in. Parents can participate in many
ways, from keeping score during mini-contest
drills to bringing a boom box to play music during
warm-ups and cool-downs.

Creating Fun Practices 
for the Whole Season
Any time you are in a leadership position, whether it’s overseeing a staff at
work or a group of kids on the lacrosse field, being prepared is vital for achiev-
ing success. As a youth lacrosse coach, you must prepare your practice plans
and then carry them out to have success with the kids on the field. You need
to map out the skills you want to teach during the season (often depending on
the age and ability level of your kids; see Chapter 2), and based on how many
practices you can have with the kids this season, you need to determine what
areas you can cover in each practice and how much time you can devote to
each one.
As your season gets under way, you have an enormous amount of informa-
tion to cover with your players — everything from passing and receiving
techniques to the rules of the game. You’ll be tempted to try to cram every-
thing in. Your best bet, however, is to choose some of the most important
aspects of lacrosse that you want to teach and then do your best to work in
some of the other stuff as the season rolls along. You don’t want to unload so
much information on the kids that you actually end up detracting from their
experience.
The following sections help you map out a great practice plan for your
season. From the planning and drilling stages to the adjustments you need to
make, we cover the big picture of planning for a youth lacrosse practice.
Setting the tone
Do you remember your involvement in sports or other activities when you
were a child? You’ll likely agree that the ones for which the leaders made learn-
ing fun and interesting were the most memorable for you. Making that same
type of connection with your players comes down to the tone you set from the
start of the season. You’ll have the season headed in the right direction if you
build it around positive feedback, encouraging words, an upbeat approach, and
a good sense of humor.
One tip for running productive practices is exuding positive energy and enthu-
siasm, no matter how well or badly the session is going. We all have bad days,
but you should never show up for practice in a bad mood, because your poor
state of mind will interfere with what you are teaching the kids. When your
players see that you’re in a good mood and happy to be at the field, they’ll
practice and play in the right frame of mind, too.
105
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

When you prepare your practices, focus on setting a fun tone. If the kids
don’t look forward to attending practices, you’re probably not doing a very
good job, and more than likely, they’re not learning many skills either. As you
put together your practice plans, ask yourself whether the drills are fun and
whether you’d like participating in them. If you answer “Yes,” chances are
that your players would, too — which is good news for everyone involved.
Determining practice length 
and frequency
Most youth lacrosse leagues, particularly at the younger age levels, have spe-
cific policies regarding how often and how long teams can practice. Before you
can begin creating your practice plans, you need to know the program’s stance
on this. (Check out Chapter 2 for more advice on checking out your league’s
rules before the season.)
Following the league’s schedule
Here’s a breakdown of the typical practice allotments for different youth
leagues:
 Ages 5 to 7: At the beginning levels, you typically get a one-hour practice
with your team each week, along with one game per week.
 Ages 8 to 12: In the middle age groups, you’re typically allowed one to
two practices a week, with a game mixed in.
 Ages 13 and older: For the older kids, you often play a couple of games a
week, as well as hit the practice field once (and sometimes twice) a week.
You can accomplish a lot during a one-hour practice if you come prepared. So
stick to that time frame when running your practices. Only at very advanced
levels should your practices run any longer than an hour.
Setting your own schedule
If you coach in an advanced league that leaves practice frequency to the
coaches’ discretion, use your best judgment in devising your team’s practice
schedule. Don’t go overboard and monopolize the kids’ time by cramming the
calendar with practices. Overloading them with too many practices can throt-
tle their interest in playing. (If you’re interested in being on the field coaching
most days of the week, overseeing a travel team may be for you. Check out
Chapter 19 for more details on coaching travel teams.)
Sometimes, due to weather factors, games are postponed and made up at 
a later date. Any time your schedule features two or three games in a week,
be sure to modify your practices accordingly so that you don’t overwhelm
your players.
106
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Distribute your practice schedule during the preseason parents’ meeting 
(see Chapter 4). The parents will appreciate the advance notice — which also
helps reduce the amount of practice time your players miss, because parents
will have time to alter their schedules to accommodate their child’s season.
Picking the right times for scrimmages
Sometimes, just to mix your practices up a bit and keep the excitement levels
high, you can conduct intrasquad scrimmages — informal games between two
units on the same team. Scrimmages can be useful tools to give kids some
gamelike experience. They often work well at the end of practices to give kids
a chance to work on the skills that they practiced during the session.
Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind regarding scrimmages:
 Alter the rules. Use your creativity to target specific skills you want
players to work on by changing the rules. If you’ve noticed a lack of
teamwork in previous games, for example, run a scrimmage in which at
least five different players have to touch the ball before anyone takes a
shot. This rule forces the kids to work together, because they must rely
on passing to be successful.
 Conduct smaller-scale scrimmages. Instead of going with a full-scale
scrimmage, split the field, and run two scrimmages at the same time.
Even if you have only enough kids to play three-on-three or four-on-four
games, you’ll be giving all of them more opportunities to pass and catch
the ball, as well as to shoot and defend.
Don’t fall into the trap of using scrimmages at every practice; use them only
in moderation. You can’t become lazy and rely on scrimmages to fill valuable
minutes of practice time because you don’t want to plan or run drills.
Overusing scrimmages takes away from your individual teaching and instruc-
tion. Spend most of your practice time running the kids through drills that
zero in on particular areas of their game; rely on scrimmages only as a tool to
break up your practices for a few minutes from time to time.
Keeping practices consistent
You have a limited amount of practice time with your kids each week, so if
you can establish a practice routine as soon as possible, your sessions will
be more efficient and effective. When players know what to expect when they
get to the field, they can mentally prepare themselves and be ready to go. 
On the other hand, if you bombard them with changes every time you get
together with them, valuable practice time will be wasted, because the play-
ers will be forced to stand around and listen to your instructions regarding
the changes.
107
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

Changing some of the drills you run from week to week is a good idea,
because the best way to help youngsters learn new skills and improve others
is to give them a challenge. You should cling to a core group of drills that
focus on the fundamentals of the game, though. (For some drills that focus 
on the fundamentals, turn to Chapter 7.)
Here’s a plan for preparing your practices:
1. Determine your prepractice warm-up, which stays the same from
week to week.
Sticking to the same warm-up and stretching routine at the start of 
each practice sets a comfortable agenda for the kids before they jump
into a session. Because some of your drills will change from week to
week as your focus shifts to different parts of the game, establishing and
maintaining a routine at the outset of practice can set the stage for a
productive outing.
2. List the skills you want to focus on.
3. List the drills you want to use to teach each skill.
4. Insert appropriate times for water breaks.
You want to have regularly scheduled water breaks throughout your
practices so that the kids understand they’ll have plenty of chances to
get a drink.
Any time you’re switching to a different drill, encourage the kids to grab
some water. This way, they’ll know that every 15 minutes or so, they’ll
have a moment to consume fluids. (For more on hydration, check out
Chapter 17.)
5. Save a few minutes at the end of each practice to talk about any
changes in the schedule or to recap what the players performed well
that day.
Getting the Most out of Practice Time
One goal you should have on your mind going into each practice is making
sure that all the players — and we stress all — benefit from their time with you
that session. Granted, this task can be challenging; you’re coaching a group of
kids who have varying skills and who may be at vastly different levels of devel-
opment. But rest assured that you’re qualified to give your whole team a good
experience in practice, and that you’ll get a real sense of satisfaction from
making it happen.
Following are a few helpful pointers that can make practices effective for the
kids and trouble free for you:
108
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Don’t allow standing around. All your drills must enable the players to
feel like that they’re an integral part of practice and that they’re accom-
plishing something that will help the team when game day rolls around.
Do whatever you can to make standing around at your practices nonex-
istent. The players are at the field to run, pass, shoot, and defend — not
stand in line waiting to step in for a few seconds of action, followed by
heading to the end of the line for more standing, watching, and waiting.
After all, the kids came to practice, right?
 Split up the drills. If you have assistant coaches or parent volunteers, you
can run at least a couple of different drills in different areas of the field at
the same time. (For tips on choosing assistants, check out Chapter 4.)
Running multiple drills lets children get in more repetitions. If you’re run-
ning the team solo, try to focus on specific drills in which the kids work 
in smaller groups; this setup gives them more touches of the ball or more
opportunities to defend, depending on what skill the drill is targeting.
 Keep everything moving. Avoid lengthy pauses between your drills,
which sabotage the energy level and enthusiasm you want to maintain
throughout the session. Strive for constant motion so that you can keep
your practices going at a good pace and increase the skill development
that takes place. Constant activity holds the kids’ attention and gives
them less chance to think about something that has nothing to do 
with lacrosse.
An added benefit of this approach is that the kids will become better con-
ditioned. Conditioning really pays dividends later in games (especially 
at the more advanced levels) if your players are able to perform as 
effectively as they did in the opening minutes.
The following sections touch on some more areas you need to be aware of to
maximize your practice time, and give you tools you can use to make every
practice productive and fun.
Building skills
Coaching youth lacrosse requires you to work your way along a logical pro-
gression, building kids’ skills one at a time. Showing a youngster how to shoot
the ball makes little sense if you haven’t already addressed the proper way to
hold the stick when carrying the ball. Neither does it make sense to devote 
50 minutes of a one-hour practice to offense and only 10 minutes to defense.
The best practices allow kids to gain valuable experience performing a wide
variety of skills.
View every practice you conduct as a building block in your team’s develop-
ment. Every time you practice, first reinforce what you’ve taught so far; then,
if the players are ready to move forward, you can add to what they’ve already
learned. This plan takes concentrated effort on your part; you have to refrain
from jumping too far ahead if you want your youngsters to grasp the basics.
109
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

If you’ve been working on executing passes to stationary players in your pre-
vious practices, and the kids have a pretty good grasp of that skill, you can
spend a couple of minutes at your next practice having them perform that
skill as a refresher. Then, to continue their learning, you can take that skill 
to the next level — by introducing how to pass on the move, to a teammate
who is moving, or while a defender is nearby, for example. By taking this
approach, you can gradually begin incorporating other aspects of the game
that your players can work on.
Evaluating your team and making the proper adjustments to fit your players’
needs allows you to teach the fundamentals in the proper order and build on
each skill in your practices. (Chapter 13 covers the art of evaluating your
team and making midseason adjustments.)
Helping players who need a hand
No matter how great a coaching job you’re doing (or are preparing to do,
because you’re taking the time to read this book), you’re bound to run into
some challenging situations in which players struggle to pick up parts of 
the game. Lacrosse requires a fairly extensive list of skills, so many players
experience difficulties from time to time.
Whenever a child is having any type of problem learning a skill, you need to
acknowledge his efforts in trying to get a handle on the technique. If you stick
by him, encouraging and motivating him every step of the way, he’ll pick up
the skill eventually or at least get better at it.
Adjusting their training
When a player really struggles with a particular skill, sometimes you can
trace the problem back to how you’re teaching it. Be willing to accept the fact
that you may need to adjust your approach. Just because the other players
picked up on the skill doesn’t mean that a better teaching method wouldn’t
make a difference with this child. Try the following techniques:
 Modify your instructions. Sometimes, just shifting the emphasis of 
your instructions to a different aspect helps put everything in clearer
perspective for the child and produces the desired results.
Suppose that when you’re going over shooting techniques, your instruc-
tions focus on the position of the player’s hands. If those instructions
aren’t clicking with the child, and her shots are straying from the mark or
aren’t generating a lot of force, modify the points you’re stressing. Instead,
focus on her footwork, and talk to her about stepping toward the target.
By changing your instructions, you can help her enjoy improvement.
110
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Break the skill down into smaller parts, and work on them individually.
Teaching a child how to execute a pass on the run, for example, involves
mastering several components. Instead of overwhelming the child with all
of them at the same time, break the skill into smaller steps.
You can begin by focusing on how the player should position his stick
while running with the ball. When he has a good handle (sorry; we could-
n’t help ourselves) on holding the stick while he’s on the move, you can
work on the next phase, which is delivering the ball to a teammate who is
stationary. From there, you can build on making a pass to a teammate who
is on the run. Next, you can incorporate a defender guarding the passer
and then add a defender covering the intended pass recipient. Gradually
keep building on his skills by taking them one at a time.
 Bring in a new drill. Perhaps the drill you’re using isn’t getting the job
done, and introducing a new one can help the child catch on.
Boosting their morale
Remaining positive and upbeat is vital, whether the technique you are teaching
is catching on or presenting difficulties for the team. You’ll get much farther
with the players, and they’ll enjoy playing for you much more, if you say some-
thing like this: “That was excellent, how you kept your eyes focused on the
attacker as she came down the field with the ball. Just remember to keep your
weight on the balls of your feet so that you’re able to move quickly in any
direction she goes.” This approach is much more effective than saying 
something like “You didn’t keep up with her again.”
Any time you’re devoting a little extra time to a particular player, don’t let
practice come to a standstill for the remainder of the team. If you’ve got
assistant coaches helping you, make sure that they keep drills going so that
the other players aren’t standing around. If you don’t have any help, start a
drill that the kids know well and that doesn’t require any instructions; then
spend a few moments with the child who is having difficulty.
Youngsters who don’t pick up skills as quickly as their teammates do may get
frustrated with themselves, perhaps with you, and even with lacrosse. You
can help minimize their disappointment by making sure that you acknowl-
edge even the slightest improvement in their play. If a youngster is really
struggling to catch passes, but the ball is beginning to bounce out of the
pocket of his stick rather than missing it altogether, he’s making progress,
which you should recognize so that he can build on that momentum.
Resist the temptation to tell a struggling player to watch how one of her
teammates performs a skill. By doing so, you may send the message that one
player is better than another.
111
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

Praising good play
Whether we like to admit it or not, we all love recognition for doing some-
thing well. Your young lacrosse players are certainly no different. Being
praised for performing a skill well — especially in front of teammates — can
be really uplifting and a great source of motivation to your players to con-
tinue learning and striving to do their best.
Following are a few ideas on giving positive feedback to your players:
 The earlier you praise, the better. Your warm-ups represent a good time
to provide some positive feedback to kids. As you oversee the stretching
exercises, for example, you can mention to a youngster that you’re really
impressed with how quickly he picked up a certain skill in your last
practice and that you’re eager to watch him put the skill to use today.
 Use creative acknowledgments. Your players will really enjoy creative
praise, and they’ll probably play even harder to receive it. Instead of
giving an ordinary high five, for example, try a low five, or make the high
five a little more exciting by having both of you jump in the air before
slapping hands.
 Ditch the negatives. Lacrosse has no place for negative body language
or tones unless you’re dealing with a discipline problem. (For more 
on handling that situation, flip to Chapter 18.) Focus on making all your
interactions positive. If you allow negative words to creep into your 
conversations or display negativity in your body language, you may par-
alyze a child’s ability to react naturally to situations, because she’ll be
afraid of making additional mistakes that will generate more unfavorable
reactions.
 Specific praise works best. When you’re recognizing good plays, general
comments like “Attaboy” and “Way to go” are OK, but you can pack a
more powerful punch by zeroing in on exactly why you’re applauding
the player. Saying something like “Great job following through to your
intended target on that pass” hits home and is more likely to stick in 
the child’s head when he attempts another pass in the future.
 Rely on the sandwich method. We’re not talking about tuna on wheat
here, but an effective approach in which you surround your corrective
comment with a pair of positive remarks.
When you’re talking to your goalie, you can say, “Susan, your stance was
perfect before the shot was taken, but then I saw you take your eye off
the ball for a split-second when you peeked at that player cutting near
you. Remember, you can’t take your eyes off the ball at any time. And I
loved how you kept your stick in proper position throughout the shot.”
This way, the child receives important feedback on a skill she isn’t 
performing the right way, as well as a confidence boost on the skills 
she is handling correctly.
112
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Halt practice. Don’t be afraid to interrupt practice for 10 to 20 seconds
to praise a child or group for doing something really well. Think about
the pride you’ll give those youngsters who passed the ball accurately all
the way down the field and generated a quality scoring chance if you
stop practice and praise them right in front of everyone for their great
execution.
 Don’t go overboard. Of course you want to praise your players to make
them feel good about what they’ve done (or tried to do to the best of
their ability). But don’t throw out praise at an assembly-line rate just for
the sake of doing so. Praising without merit takes away some of your
credibility and believability with the team. If a player isn’t hustling at 
full speed to scoop up a loose ball, and you applaud him for his effort
anyway, you’re sending a bad message that giving 100-percent effort 
isn’t important to you, and the child may develop some bad habits.
Make it one of your goals to praise every child on the team during every
practice. You can praise anything — from the way she hustled to get back on
defense after a player got past her to the way she demonstrated great team-
work by congratulating a teammate for a nice play. You can ensure that you
distribute your praise equally by carrying a roster in your practice planner
and making a mark next to a player’s name every time you make a positive
remark.
When discipline is in order, never push it to the side because you want to
retain “pal” status with the player. No matter what happens on the field,
you’re still the coach and leader, and you don’t want the team to lose respect
for you. You can be demanding while maintaining a positive tone and disposi-
tion. Along with your encouragement, you can provide constructive criticism
that helps your players improve in all areas of their game.
Wrapping Up on a Positive Note
Ending your practices on a positive note is just as important as how you kick
them off. How you choose to start a practice sets the tone for the entire ses-
sion; how you end it goes a long way toward setting the kids’ frame of mind
the next time you gather them for a practice or game. When you’re able to
send players home with smiles on their faces, filled with enthusiasm and
desire to get better, you’ve done a great job of wrapping up your practice.
Luckily for you, we have some secrets to share for achieving this goal. To
finish your practices on a strong note, consider these suggestions:
 Save the best for last. Use one of your most popular drills or scrimmages
at the end of practice. If this method goes over really big, you may have
trouble coaxing the kids off the field. That problem is a really nice one to
113
Chapter 6: Conducting Fun-Filled Practices

have, because it shows how into the game your players are — and how
much fun they’re having.
 Give a quick wrap-up talk. Let the kids know that you appreciate the
hard work and effort they put in and that you’re pleased to see the
strides they’ve made. Keep this talk general and focused on the entire
team. This chat usually isn’t the time to recognize individual efforts,
because you run the risk of alienating the other kids. 
Never use your postpractice chat to provide constructive criticism or
rehash a drill that didn’t go well. After practices in which nothing goes
right — and you’ll have days like that — search for some nugget to high-
light that allows you to focus on the positives. You can pin your praise
on all sorts of areas, such as the players’ work ethic or the way they
encouraged their teammates during a drill.
 Review the upcoming schedule. If the next time you’ll see the players is
at a game, make sure that everyone can attend so that you can plan your
lineup and structure your substitution patterns for game day.
 Thank the team for their hard work, and conclude with a team cheer 
(if you have one). You can call it a day after the excitement dies down!

G
etting your team excited about playing lacrosse on game day usually
doesn’t require a whole lot of effort, simply because kids are pretty
keyed up for the action. Generating the same type of enthusiasm for your
practices may be a little more tricky. The secret — which we divulge to you in
this chapter — is running drills that are fun, interesting, and great at pushing
skills to the next level.
In this chapter, we take care of all your needs in this area. We run down all
sorts of offense, defense, and goaltending drills that you can slip into your
practices all season long. You can easily tweak these drills, making them
easier or more challenging, based on the ever-changing needs of your team
from week to week.
Before you have your players running up and down the field performing
these drills, of course, you need to put them through a proper warm-up to
help prevent injuries, as well as to prepare their bodies to perform at their
best. So you find valuable information on the basics of stretching in this
chapter as well.
Warming Up Right
For many kids, stretching is about as appealing as eating a big bowl of
Brussels sprouts. After all, youngsters arrive for practices and games eager
to take shots on goal, make passes to teammates, and defend against oppo-
nents who are attacking their team’s goal — not to spend time stretching
hamstrings and loosening up neck muscles. Yet your practices should always
begin with a segment devoted to warming up and stretching. Warming up is

the springboard to developing healthy young bodies, and bodies that are
loosened up properly are less likely to be injured during the course of the
session.
Completing warm-ups and stretching exercises before engaging in intense
physical activity on the lacrosse field boosts muscle temperatures and
increases flexibility — catalysts for building skills and helping players advance
in the sport. Players, especially older ones at the more-advanced levels, are
susceptible to injury when their muscles are not loosened up properly before
they step onto the field. Exercises that develop muscle flexibility also reduce
injury risks by preventing those muscles from tiring easily.
Your warm-up sessions should always begin with light exercise, such as a
moderate-paced jog. A basic lap around the field or a jog back and forth
between the goals gets the job done and clears the way for some stretching.
One way to make the warm-up more beneficial for the kids is to have them pass
the ball back and forth to a partner while they’re jogging. This way, they can
work on some important skills while getting their bodies ready for practice. At
the youngest levels, simply having the kids carry a ball with their sticks while
jogging helps them become more comfortable maintaining control of the ball
while on the move.
Stretching basics
The two primary types of stretches are
 Static: These basic stretches involve placing the body in a specific 
position and holding that position for several seconds.
 Ballistic: These stretches rely on momentum, so the player has far less
control of ballistic stretches than static stretches.
If you’re coaching youngsters who are relatively new to lacrosse or any other
organized sport, start them out with static stretches to get them used to
preparing their bodies for activity. As they get older, you can incorporate the
ballistic approach to prep them for competition.
Players should have designated spots for the stretching exercises at the start
of each practice. If you’re coaching a large team, having assigned positions
for everyone on the field lets you spot a player’s absence easily. This system
also gives you more time to adjust your practice drills to fit the number of
players present.
Keep the stretching exercises consistent. You don’t want to waste valuable
practice time introducing new stretches each week of the season. Design a
basic warm-up and stretching routine that the kids can stick to all season long.
116
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

In addition to the warm-up, each practice should wind down with a 5-minute
period of light exercise to help players’ bodies return to their normal resting
state. Run a specific play at half speed, or work on defending an attack; then
conclude with a couple minutes of stretching the large muscles. The cool-
down doesn’t have to be nearly as focused as the warm-up session, because
the purpose is to wind down from the activity rather than build up to it.
Warm-up fundamentals
Here are some additional warm-up fundamentals to keep in mind:
 Begin every practice with a warm-up. Always start your practices with
a warm-up and stretching. Repetition is critical; when youngsters know
that they’ll be stretching at every practice, they learn that stretching is
an important aspect of being a lacrosse player.
 The younger the kids, the simpler the stretches. For young kids, the
stretching period can be basic and quick. You just want to introduce them
to the concept of stretching and get them into the habit of doing so before
any activity. Some basic arm windmills and toe touches are all you need at
this level.
 Hit ’em all. You want the stretches to cover all the major muscle groups
that the kids will use during the practice, which means stretches for the
hamstrings, calves, neck, arms, and back.
 Don’t let the kids strain while stretching. Bouncing and straining to
reach a desired position can result in injury. Instead, stress moving
slowly to the desired position, just slightly beyond discomfort; holding
that position for a short period; and then relaxing. Players want to bend
down slowly and touch their toes, count to 5, and then relax and return
to an upright position. Remind kids that mild tension — not pain — is
what they should strive for in any type of stretch.
Youngsters should ease into the stretches while inhaling through the
nose and exhaling through the mouth. Sharp, sudden movements can
injure muscles and sideline a child.
 Assume an active role. During any stretching exercises, make sure that
you have one-on-one contact with all the kids at some point. This con-
tact is particularly important for youngsters who are new to lacrosse or
to the whole concept of stretching before participating in an activity.
When a child is stretching out his hamstrings, for example, place his
hand on the back of his leg so that he can feel the exact area of his body
that’s being stretched and prepared for competition. This technique also
helps ensure that the kids are following proper form.
 Eliminate messing around. The stretching period isn’t a time for kids to
be goofing around. It’s a valuable part of your practice time, and kids
need to treat it that way. Keep their attention focused on the stretches
and concentrating on performing them correctly.
117
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

 Don’t forget to stretch out your muscles, too. As the coach, you’re 
running all over the field teaching skills, demonstrating techniques, and
providing feedback, so joining the kids (and your assistants) for stretch-
ing serves a couple of useful purposes: It helps protect you from being
sidelined with a strained or pulled muscle, which affects your ability 
to work with the kids; and it’s a good opportunity to bond with your
players by getting on the field with them.
Warm-up drills for everyone
Maintaining and improving children’s flexibility is essential not only for pre-
venting injuries, but also for giving them a solid foundation of strength, bal-
ance, and coordination. Incorporating a variety of stretches and
strength-building exercises is a key factor in preparing youngsters for the
physical demands of lacrosse. This section describes several stretches you
can use during your warm-ups to help prepare youngsters’ bodies for prac-
tices and games.
The more flexible players are, the greater their range of motion, which usually
translates into improved play on the field. A youngster who has tight ham-
strings, for example, is limited in how fast she can move down the field. If you
help that child gradually stretch out her hamstrings and gain increased flexi-
bility, she can enjoy a fuller range of motion, which leads to greater speed — 
a valuable asset for any position on the lacrosse field.
Standing squats
This stretch works the quadriceps. The child starts with his feet shoulder
width apart and his hands on his hips (see Figure 7-1). He squats into a deep
knee bend, keeping his body upright and steady, and centering his weight
over his heels. In a slow, controlled motion, he pushes up into his starting
position.
Figure 7-1:

118
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Make sure that the child’s weight isn’t distributed over his toes, which places
excessive stress on the knees. Also make sure that the child maintains good
posture and doesn’t relax his upper body, which places too much stress on
the lower back.
Forward lunges
The child begins with her body in an upright position, her arms relaxed at
her sides. She steps forward as far as possible with one leg. Bending her
knees, she lowers her back leg toward the ground, stopping just before the
knee touches (see Figure 7-2). The knee of the lead leg should be aligned
directly over the heel. Using the hamstrings (back of the thigh) of the lead
leg, she pulls the rear leg forward and returns to the starting position. She
repeats with the opposite leg.
Watch the child’s form. If the youngster doesn’t step forward far enough, the
knee of the lead leg can pass over her toes, placing stress on the lead knee.
Pushing off the rear leg to return to the starting position eliminates the bene-
fits of working the hamstrings. Also make sure that the child maintains good
posture throughout this stretch; bad posture places unwanted stress on the
lower back.
Calf raises
The child begins with his feet shoulder width apart and his hands on his
waist. He rises onto his toes on both feet and slowly lowers himself toward
the ground. He stops just before his heels touch the ground and then repeats
the upward phase of the stretch.
Make sure that the child distributes his weight evenly across his toes; if he
doesn’t, he’s working only part of the calf muscle. Don’t let the child lock his
knees, which reduces the effectiveness of the stretch.

119
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Hamstring stretch
While sitting, the child assumes the hurdle position (see Figure 7-3) by
extending her right leg fully and bending her left leg, placing the bottom of
her foot along the inside of her right thigh. While keeping her back straight,
she leans forward slowly, bringing her chest toward her right knee and reach-
ing toward her toes with her right hand. Depending on how much flexibility
the child has, she either places her hands on the ground alongside her left leg
or holds her toes. She holds the stretch for a couple of seconds and then
releases. Next, she repeats the stretch with the left leg.
Make sure that the child isn’t lunging for her toes. She shouldn’t feel any 
pain — just a slight stretch in her muscles.
Quadriceps stretch
The child grabs his right foot or ankle and lifts it behind his body (see 
Figure 7-4). He presses the top of his foot into his hand while pressing his
hips slightly forward.
His lower leg and foot should be directly behind his upper leg, and there
shouldn’t be any twisting in or out. Make sure that the child doesn’t rest his
foot against his buttocks.
If any kids have trouble balancing on one leg for the quadriceps stretch, have
each player put his free hand on the shoulder of a stretching partner to 
balance.
Groin stretch
The child sits on the ground and places the soles of her feet together, with
her knees to the sides (see Figure 7-5). Leaning forward, the child presses for-
ward slowly until she feels mild tension in the groin.

Waist/lower back stretch
The child stands with his feet beyond shoulder width apart, arcs his left arm
over his head, and points to the right while his right arm rests against his
right knee (see Figure 7-6). Then he reverses to the other side, using his right
arm pointing to the left. Perform several repetitions in each direction.
Upper back stretch
The youngster stands and stretches both arms behind her back, clasping
them together while puffing her chest out (see Figure 7-7). She holds the
stretch for a few seconds and then releases.

Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Neck stretch
The child stands and slowly turns his head all the way to the left; next, he
slowly turns his head all the way to the right. Then he tucks his chin to his
chest to stretch out the back of his neck.
Always caution the kids to perform the neck stretch slowly. You don’t want
them straining or pulling something by being too forceful.
Knee bends
While the child is seated on the ground, she bends her left knee and places
her left foot flat on the ground. She follows by placing her right foot and ankle
on her left thigh, just above her knee. She places her hands on the ground

behind her hips and presses her chest toward her knee and foot until she
feels a stretch in her groin (see Figure 7-8).
The child’s upper torso, neck, and shoulders should remain open and
straight; don’t let her round her upper back.
Hip flexor stretch
The child stands with his feet in a lunge position (see Figure 7-9), with both
feet facing forward and his front knee slightly bent. He briefly pushes up onto
his toes on his back foot. He also presses his hips forward while tightening
his buttocks and then slowly lowers his body until he feels a stretch in the
front of his hips. While he performs this stretch, his upper body remains
upright and centered directly over his hips.
Arm stretch
The youngster stands with her feet shoulder width apart, interlaces her fingers,
and stretches her arms straight up over her head. Her palms are facing up.

Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Warm-up drills for older players
For the older kids, you can use some more-aggressive stretches to help get
them ready.
High knees
The child takes an exaggerated high step forward, lifting his knee as high as
possible while simultaneously pushing up on the toes of the opposite foot (see
Figure 7-10). The arm opposite the leg being lifted swings up to chin level. This
move works the hips and shoulders, and also stretches the quadriceps, glutes,
shoulders, and lower back.
Have the kids go 25 yards down the field performing these stretches; then
have them turn around and repeat the move on the way back.
Lunges
The youngster begins by placing her hands behind her head, with her fingers
interlaced. She takes a long stride forward, placing her foot flat on the ground
while coming up on the toes of her back foot (see Figure 7-11). The knee of
her back foot is barely off the ground. The front knee should be at a 90-degree
angle. She brings her back leg up and stands upright before repeating with
the opposite leg.
Lunges stretch the glutes, hamstrings, hip flexors, and calves. Have the players
do 10 to 15 repetitions for each leg.
Figure 7-10:
High knees

both the

124
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Straight leg kicks
These moves stretch the hamstrings, calves, and lower back. The youngster
begins by kicking his right leg up as high as it’ll go; then he reaches out his
left hand to touch his toes (see Figure 7-12). The player’s extended arm
should remain parallel to the ground. Then he repeats the stretch with the
opposite leg and arm.
Have players perform ten repetitions for each leg.
Running butt taps
This move gives the quadriceps and hip flexors a good stretch. The child
begins running, flexing her knees so that each time she lifts her foot off the
ground during the run, her heel comes all the way back and contacts her butt
(see Figure 7-13). While performing this stretch, the youngster should be
leaning slightly forward, with her arms swinging close to her body.

Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Have the kids complete 20 total kicks within 10 to 15 yards, or have them do
this stretch while running in place. You can also have them carry a ball in
their sticks to get them used to handling the ball while on the move.
Running carioca
This movement stretches the abductors, glutes, ankles, and hips. The young-
ster begins on the balls of his feet and twists his hips while crossing one leg
in front of the other. He brings his back leg through and crosses his lead leg
behind the back leg (see Figure 7-14). His shoulders remain square through
the entire drill.
You can have the players use this move to go across the width of the field
and then return to their starting position.

Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Going on the Offensive
Moving the ball down the field and generating quality scoring chances against
opponents require each player to be comfortable with the offensive basics of
the game: moving with the ball, passing and catching it while standing still and
while moving, and taking accurate shots. The better your players execute
these skills — especially when defenders are harassing them on game day —
the more enjoyment they will gain from playing.
In the following sections, we take a look at a variety of drills you can use to
help your players get a good grip on the offensive fundamentals of lacrosse.
Concentrating on cradling
Maneuvering on the field with the ball in the pocket of the stick — known as
cradling — is one of the most basic elements of lacrosse. Regardless of what
position a child is playing, she needs cradling skills to have any measure of
success in playing and enjoying the game. The drills in this section zero in on
this fundamental skill.
Cone Weave
The better players are at making sharp cuts while maintaining possession of
the ball, the more success they’ll enjoy getting by defenders and creating
more scoring opportunities for themselves or teammates. This drill is perfect
for improving footwork — a key skill for lacrosse players at all levels.
What you need: Pylons or other safe markers (such as plastic bottles or
towels). A ball for each player.
How it works: Set up pylons randomly around the field to create a course
that the players maneuver through while cradling a ball, cutting back and
forth from their right to their left. Set some pylons close together to force
players to make sharp cuts back to back; leave bigger gaps between other
pylons so that players have to run several yards, building up speed, before
making a move.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that the kids keep their heads up, rather than
look down at their feet, so that they develop the habit of scanning the field at
all times. In the older age groups, you can add a competitive element by
timing the players to see who can negotiate the course fastest.
You don’t want to waste a lot of valuable practice time forcing kids to stand
in line waiting to do this drill. If you have enough markers and a couple of
assistants to help you supervise, you can set up a few courses so that more
players can participate at the same time. You can also speed things up by
127
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

starting players off at 10-second intervals so that you have several players
weaving through the course at the same time.
Motion Mania
If your players can move efficiently in any direction with the ball, without
bobbling or losing control of it, defenders will have difficulty sticking with
them. This drill helps players improve their cradling techniques.
What you need: One ball for each player.
How it works: Line the players up facing you, with at least 8 feet between
players. If you have a big group of kids, you can have several rows; just make
sure to have that 8-foot space on all sides. Each player begins by cradling a
ball in his stick. To start the drill, signal a direction with your hand, and have
the group run quickly in that direction. After just a couple of seconds, indicate
another direction, thereby forcing the players to stop and change directions.
Coaching pointers: Be sure to mix up your directions so that players get
plenty of practice moving not only left and right, but also to the front and
back. Watch the players’ heads to make sure that their heads are up, not
down and taking peeks at the ball. You want to get players comfortable
moving in all directions without glancing at the ball; otherwise, they may not
see an open teammate or a good scoring opportunity because their vision
isn’t on the field, where it belongs.
Pumping up the passing and catching
The better your team is at passing and catching the ball, the more chances it
has to score goals. The following drills zero in on this important aspect of
offense.
Use tennis balls in some of your passing and catching drills to help players
develop “soft hands,” which are a real asset in performing these important
skills during games.
Partner Passes
This drill is useful for helping players hone their stationary passing and
catching skills.
What you need: One ball for each pair of players.
How it works: Break the team up into pairs, and give each twosome a ball.
Have the pairs stand 15 yards apart, facing each other. On your command,
the partners start passing the ball back and forth. To help the kids concen-
trate on making catches, have them keep track of how many catches their
twosome has by calling out the number of each reception as they make it.
128
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

You can add a competitive twist by seeing which pair can make ten catches
first or (to prevent the players from rushing to make passes) can make the
most catches in a row.
Coaching pointers: You want players to be using the proper overhand tech-
nique (covered in Chapter 9). Make sure that they are following through
toward their target, not chopping the follow-through short or coming across
their bodies with their sticks while they’re releasing the ball.
Stationary Passes
During games, you can’t expect players to make pinpoint passes every time,
especially when a defender is charging at them or Grandma is stationed on
the sideline attempting to take a good action picture. So players have to be
able to move to their left and right to snare passes that stray off target. This
drill helps them get used to making these types of grabs.
What you need: One ball for each pair of players.
How it works: Break the team into pairs, and give each twosome a ball. Have
the kids face their partners with about 10 to 15 yards between them. The
player with the ball begins by intentionally passing the ball to his partner’s
right side. His partner catches the ball and delivers a pass back to his part-
ner’s right side. The next passes are made to the left side. The pairs continue
rotating between sides. Have them see how many passes they can complete
in a row.
Coaching pointers: During games, players will be forced to deliver passes to
teammates who are covered tightly, so they have to be capable of working
the ball in different directions. These passes are often a little more difficult
for youngsters to execute, because they don’t have a natural target, so make
sure that they are stepping toward the intended area, which should be about
3 feet to their partner’s left or right.
Knock-’Em-Out Pairs
This competitive drill helps players concentrate on making accurate passes
and catches with something at stake — great practice for performing in close
games, in which an errant pass or dropped ball can be the difference between
a win and a loss.
What you need: One ball for each pair of players.
How it works: Break the team into pairs. Position the players so that they’re
facing their partners, about 5 yards apart. Be sure to leave at least 10 feet of
space between each of the pairs. One player in each twosome has a ball and
begins the drill by making a pass to her partner. If the ball touches the ground
due to a poor pass or drop, that pair is knocked out of the drill. If the pass is
caught, the player who delivered it moves back 2 yards. Keep moving the
passer back 2 yards every time a successful exchange is made until only one
pair remains.
129
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Coaching pointers: Be sure to have another drill set up so that the kids who
get knocked out of this one can jump into the other drill. Or simply have
those players practice passing the ball to one another so that they’re ready
to go if you’ve set aside time in your practice to run this drill a few times.
During the drill, keep a close watch on the kids who are passing the ball to
make sure that they follow through when releasing the ball. Sometimes, kids
tend to stop their sticks as soon as the ball leaves their possession, which
can lead to passes that fail to find their intended targets.
Rapid Receptions
Players who are skilled at catching the ball, as well as getting rid of it quickly
when they spot open teammates, can make game day tough on opponents.
This drill enables players to develop a quick release that can help turn up an
offense’s effectiveness several notches.
What you need: One ball for each pair of players.
How it works: Break the team up into pairs, and give each twosome a ball.
Spread the pairs around the field, 15 yards apart. On your command, the kids
begin passing the ball back and forth with their partners as quickly as possi-
ble. You can turn the drill into a fun team competition by seeing which pair
can complete the most passes during a 2-minute period.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that your players aren’t sacrificing proper
technique in an effort to speed their passes, which sometimes happens in a
drill that has a time element involved. If you choose to go the competitive
route with this drill, use different time periods — such as 30 seconds or 45
seconds — to help hold the players’ interest.
Shooting for perfection
For many young lacrosse players, nothing is more exciting than scoring goals,
although some players at the beginning level derive more satisfaction from
chasing grasshoppers during practices and games. Slip the following drills
into your practices to help all your players hone their shooting skills — and
have lots of fun doing so, too.
Target Shots
This drill helps players learn to pick out a specific area of the net and direct
shots there.
What you need: One player, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in the net, and the offensive
player stands about 15 yards in front of the goalie. You stand behind the net,
130
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

out of the goalie’s sight, and signal where you want the player to take the
shot: upper left or right corner, lower left or right corner, or through the
goalie’s legs. Continue picking different locations before each shot.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that after you give the signal, the shooter
doesn’t reveal his intentions to the goalie by looking directly where he
intends to shoot.
You can make this drill a fun competition for the entire team by giving each
child 10 shots and awarding a point for every goal that is scored in the location
you chose.
Shots on the Go
The most dangerous shooters — and the ones who get to celebrate goals with
teammates most often — are those who are capable of delivering accurate
shots while on the move. This drill helps them learn to get a good handle on
this skill.
What you need: Four players, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in the net. Position two players
to the left of the goalie and two players to the right; they should be about 10
yards away from the goalie and several yards off to the side. Have several
balls in front of each twosome.
Figure 7-15 shows the action. On your command, the first player to the left of
the goalie sprints across the field (1), cuts in toward the goalie (2), and takes
a shot on net while moving forward (3). After taking the shot, she continues
across the field to the other side (5). As soon as the shot is released, the
player on the opposite side darts across the middle (4), cuts toward the net
(6), releases a shot, and continues on across the field (7). The drill continues
with players on each side of the field taking turns racing into the middle and
delivering shots.

Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

Coaching pointers: Make sure that the players are keeping their heads up and
on the goal, rather than looking down at their feet, because under game condi-
tions, they need to be aware of where their teammates and defenders are.
To increase the difficulty of the drill as the players sprint across the middle
of the field, you can determine when they must cut toward the net by calling
out “Cut!” This requirement forces the players to react quickly, much as they
have to during games.
Catch and Shoot
Many times during games, players must rely on teammates to get them the
ball when they are open. Players who are good at catching these passes and
getting off shots pose problems for defenders. This drill helps them become
more proficient in this aspect of the game.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in the net. Two players stand
behind the net, with one off to the goalie’s left and the other off to the goalie’s
right. Each player has several balls in front of him. The other offensive player
takes a spot about 10 yards in front of the goalie. On your command, the
player on the goalie’s right delivers a pass to the player out in front, who
catches the ball and quickly takes a shot on net. As soon as the shot is
released, the player on the goalie’s left passes him a ball, which he catches
and then shoots. Continue the drill, alternating between the two passers.
Coaching pointers: Keep a close watch to be sure that the player receiving
the passes and taking the shots is watching the ball, not taking his eye off it
in his enthusiasm to get off a shot. You want to keep this drill moving at a fast
pace, but don’t allow the passers to sacrifice accuracy by rushing so much
that their passes are veering off target. Be sure to rotate the kids so that each
player gets a chance to be both a passer and shooter.
One-on-One
The ability to beat a defender one-on-one and create an opening to shoot or
pass is a real asset for any player to have in her offensive arsenal.
What you need: Two players and one goalie. A ball.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in the net. Position one player
with a ball about 20 yards away from the goalie. A defender begins 5 yards
away from the offensive player. On your command, the offensive player tries
to maneuver past the defender and get off a shot on goal.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that the defender isn’t committing any penal-
ties. You want to keep your eye on the offensive player to ensure that she is
protecting the ball properly. To increase the difficulty of the drill for the
offensive player, allow only 5 seconds before a shot must be taken.
132
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Facing off
Face-offs represent valuable opportunities to gain possession of the ball that
(ideally) lead to scoring opportunities for your team. The following drills help
your players get some quality practice in this important aspect of the game.
Dueling Partners
The ability to win face-offs and gain possession of the ball is key to building a
successful offensive attack. This drill helps refine those skills.
What you need: Four players and one ball.
How it works: Split the four players into two-person teams. Have a player
from each pair line up to take the face-off, with his partner about 10 feet
behind him. On your command, the players face off for the ball and attempt
to gain possession of it. Whichever team secures the ball tries to control it as
long as possible, while the team that didn’t secure it tries to take control. Run
the drill for a minute or two, and limit the playing area so that the pair that
gains control can’t run all over the place.
Coaching pointers: Another fun twist that incorporates a passing element is
that the twosome who gains control receives a point for each pass it com-
pletes. Run the drill for a minute, and see over the course of the drill which
pair is able to accumulate the most points.
Mystery Moves
Players can employ several face-off techniques (check out Chapter 9 for the
basics). This drill is good for helping younger players learn how to execute
face-offs.
What you need: Two players and one ball.
How it works: The two players take their positions for the face-off. You whis-
per in the ear of one player what type of face-off technique you want her to
use. On your command, the players vie for the ball.
Coaching pointers: Keep a close eye on the players’ technique to ensure that
they are executing the face-off properly. Also, be sure to give all the kids a
chance to try to win the face-off by using the techniques you whisper to
them.
Staying Alive
This competitive drill for older players is a fun way to close out practice.
What you need: The entire team. A ball.
133
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

How it works: Randomly pair the players up, and conduct a quick mini-tourna-
ment to determine which player is best at winning face-offs. Call each pair up,
and conduct a face-off. The player who secures possession of the ball stays
alive; the other player is knocked out of the competition. Continue pairing up
the kids who win their face-off battles until only one youngster remains.
Coaching pointers: When conducting this drill, you want to run through it
quickly, because you don’t want the kids who are knocked out to be standing
around long. If you have a large group of kids on your team, have another
drill for those who get knocked out to participate in.
Scooping up the ball
Any time a ball is loose on the field during a game, you want your players
hustling to gain control of it as quickly as you would pounce on a $50 bill
lying on the sidewalk. The following drills focus on this part of the game.
Ball Chase
Whenever a ball is up for grabs on the field, you want your players giving it
their all in battling the opponent for it. To help instill that mentality in your
team, turn to this drill.
What you need: A bucket of balls.
How it works: Break the team up into pairs. The drill begins with a player
standing on each side of you. You toss a ball in any direction. As soon as the
ball is thrown, the two players race after it to see who can come up with 
possession of it.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that the players, in their exuberance to scoop
up the ball, aren’t committing penalties. To turn the drill into a fun team com-
petition, split the kids into two teams, and keep score to see which team
snags the most balls. This competition helps get the kids really enthusiastic
about doing well, as well as cheering on their teammates, which usually
spices up a practice and leads to increased skill development.
Retrieve and React
One of the many neat aspects of lacrosse is that players must switch from
offense to defense — and vice versa — in the blink of an eye. This drill helps
players make that transition.
What you need: Three players, one ball, and a goal.
How it works: The goalie takes his place in the net. You begin standing about
30 yards away from the goal, with a player standing on either side of you.
Throw the ball several yards out in front of the players. As soon as you
134
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

release the ball, the two players chase after it and vie to gain possession. The
player who scoops up the ball assumes the role of the attacker; the other
plays defense. The attacker tries to move in on the goalie and get off a shot;
the defender works to prevent a shot.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that players use only safe techniques that are
within the rules as they contest for the loose balls. To keep the drill moving,
give the player who gains possession of the ball only 10 seconds to get off a
shot. This restriction ensures that players don’t hold onto the ball for long
periods, trying to create an opening to get off a shot.
Drilling on Defense
Defending opposing players requires a variety of skills that are much different
from those needed when your team has possession of the ball. Being an effec-
tive defender requires the ability to adapt and react to what the opponent is
doing. The following drills are designed to help your players (regardless of 
the positions they play) enhance their defensive skills, deny opponents goal-
scoring opportunities, and get the ball back for their team.
One-on-one action
Disrupting an opposing player who is on the attack requires a broad range of
skills. The following sections provide some one-on-one drills to help your
players improve those all-important defensive techniques.
Dodge and Roll
This drill tests players’ abilities to react to sudden moves and to defend
against attacks.
What you need: Two players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in the net. Designate one player
to play offense, and give her a ball. She stands about 10 yards away from the
goalie, with her back to the goalie. The defender begins 3 yards away from
the offensive player, facing her. On your command, the offensive player spins
to her left or right and tries to get off a shot before the defender can prevent
it from happening.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that the defensive player isn’t committing any
penalties. Also, encourage the offensive player to use fakes to get the
defender off balance.
135
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

If you’re coaching in a boys’ league that allows checking, you’ll want the
defender to use that technique to help counter the offensive player’s moves.
Read and React Tag
This drill is a fun one to use with younger players to help them learn to follow
the player they’re guarding.
What you need: Two players and one ball.
How it works: Break the team up into pairs, and designate one player in each
pair as offensive and the other as defensive. Give the offensive player a ball
to carry. The offensive player stands at the midfield line, with the defensive
player 10 yards away from him. On your command, the offensive player takes
off; the defender must chase him down and touch him with his stick.
Coaching pointers: You can run this drill in 1-minute intervals all over the
field that so many players can participate at the same time. You want the
offensive players to use their speed, as well as fakes and cuts, to avoid getting
tagged by the defender. Remind your defenders to keep their heads up and
their eyes focused on the offensive players’ chests, which will cut down on the
defenders going for fakes and taking themselves out of position.
Corner Checks
If you’re coaching in a boys’ league that allows checking, this drill helps
defenders learn to use the technique to their advantage.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: Break the kids up into groups of three, and designate an offen-
sive player and two defensive players. The goalie takes his position in the net.
The offensive player begins standing about 25 yards away from the goal. The
two defenders face him, standing about 5 yards away. On your command, the
offensive player tries to maneuver toward the net and get off a shot; the two
defenders check him to keep him away from the net. Give the offensive player
a set amount of time — such as 30 seconds or 1 minute — to get off a shot.
Coaching pointers: At the older levels of play, this drill can turn pretty
aggressive, so make sure that the defenders use proper checking techniques
at all times.
Goalie moves
Quick reflexes, excellent hand-eye coordination, and superb footwork are
some of the most important ingredients young goaltenders should focus on
developing. The following drills will help your goalies excel in the net.
136
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Shooting Shuttle
The ability to stop shots from all angles is a necessity for success for any
goalie. This drill gives your goalies a chance to defend a barrage of shots in 
a short period, which also enhances their hand-eye coordination.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and 15 balls.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in front of the net. Position three
players about 10 yards away from the goalie, with about 10 feet separating
those three players and with five balls in front of each player. On your com-
mand, the three players scoop up a ball. The player on the left shoots first, so
the goalie moves into position to defend the shot from that angle. After the
shot is taken, the goalie quickly slides into the middle to face the shot from
the player in the center, and as soon as that shot is taken, she moves over
and gets into position to stop the shot from the player on the right. Continue
with all the shots in rapid succession until no balls remain.
Coaching pointers: With so many shots coming at them, some young goalies
tend to get sloppy with their footwork and the positioning of their hands.
Make sure that the goalie keeps her body facing the shooter and that her
glove hand is in the proper position to knock away shots.
Mystery Shots
During games, goalies never know when or where shots will come from, so
this drill is ideal for helping them learn to react quickly to shots.
What you need: Two players, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in the net. Two players position
themselves about 15 yards away from the goalie, with approximately 10 feet
between them. Each of the two players possesses a ball. You stand off to the
side, out of the goalie’s sight. You signal to the two players which one you want
to shoot the ball on net. On your command, both players move their sticks into
shooting position, but only the designated player actually continues through
with the shot; the other player simply fakes a shot. The goalie must react to the
actual shooter and attempt to stop his shot.
Coaching pointers: Make sure that the goalie’s head is up and that his eyes
are focused on both players. You don’t want him to focus on only one
shooter and guess who will be taking the shot; you want him to read both
players and react as soon as the shot is released.
Besides being a good exercise for your goalies, this drill helps your other play-
ers enhance their fakes, which they can use during games to get defenders out
of position.
137
Chapter 7: Getting with the Drills

High and Low
The most effective goalies are those who are comfortable stopping both high
and low shots. This drill helps goalies become more proficient at stopping
both types of shots.
What you need: One player, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in the net; the offensive player
begins approximately 15 yards away. The player scoops up a ball, and you
say either “High” or “Low.” The player must then take a shot at that height.
You can have the player take several shots in a short period.
Coaching pointers: Because the goalie knows the type of shot that is coming,
she’ll be able to develop some confidence making stops. If she’s pretty good
at stopping the majority of the shots, you can increase the difficulty by
moving the player in several feet closer. You can also turn the drill into a
competition by awarding a point to the shooter for every goal scored and a
point to the goalie for every shot that doesn’t find the net.
Putting It All Together: 
Sample Practice Plans
Now that you have some drills to incorporate, you’re ready to put a practice
together. A sample one-hour practice for a team of beginning players could
look something like this:
 5 minutes: Warm-up. Get your players into the habit of warming up at
the start of each practice with some basic jumping jacks, arm windmills,
and leg stretches.
 10 minutes: The Cone Weave gets the kids’ legs churning and their
hearts pumping, and helps set the tone for an energetic, productive
practice.
 10 minutes: Passing and catching the ball is a key skill for playing any
position, so go with the Partner Passes drill.
 5 minutes: After you have the kids work on their passes, run the Knock-
’Em-Out Pairs drill as a fun way to wrap up work on these particular skills.
Just be sure to have the kids who get knocked out of this drill continue
working on their passing and catching off to the side with their teammates
who are also no longer alive in the drill.
138
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 15 minutes: All kids love shooting drills, so run the Shots on the Go drill
on one half of the field and the Target Shots drill at the other end of the
field. Be sure to rotate the kids so that each player gets a chance to 
participate in both drills.
 10 minutes: Defensive-oriented drills should always be part of your prac-
tices, so at one end of the field, use the Dodge and Roll drill, and at the
other end, go with the Read and React Tag drill. After 5 minutes, rotate
the kids so that they all have a chance to participate in both drills.
 5 minutes: Have the players cool down with some light stretches. While
they’re performing these stretches, take time to applaud them on their
effort throughout the practice and to acknowledge their improvement in
different areas of the game.
Here is a look at another practice plan you can follow using the drills 
introduced in this chapter:
 5 minutes: Warm-up. Every practice should start with this to help prepare
the young bodies for physical activity.
 10 minutes: Run the Stationary Passes drill. This is a nice follow up to
the stretching, and allows the kids the chance to work their way into the
practice.
 5 minutes: Go with the Rapid Receptions drill. Run a series of one-minute
mini tournaments and see which pair can complete the most passes 
in a row.
 15 minutes: At one end of the field run the Catch and Shoot drill to help
players develop their skills of catching the ball and releasing shots
quickly. At the opposite end of the field run the Ball Chase drill. Be sure
to rotate the kids so they have a chance to participate in each drill.
 10 minutes: The Cone Weave drill. Break the kids up into groups of
three, and see which group is the fastest by combining each of their
times. This will incorporate a team element and have the kids cheering
for their group partners.
 10 minutes: At one end of the field run the Shooting Shuttle, and at the
other end go with the Mystery Shots drill. Rotate the players so they
have a chance to do both drills.
 5 minutes: Conclude your practice with a cool down.
You can be flexible with your practice schedule and tweak it based on how
the session is unfolding. If you find that a particular drill is far too easy for
the kids, for example, you don’t need to continue it, despite how much time
you may have allotted for it in your practice plan. Instead, jump to your next
drill, or fall back on a backup drill that you have ready to go in case another
doesn’t go as expected.

G
ame days are exciting times for players, because they get the chance to
use the skills and techniques they’ve been practicing so hard all week
(and to slip on the cool uniform, too!). Those days are equally enjoyable 
for you if you’re prepared to handle the flood of responsibilities that come
your way.
Coaching a youth lacrosse team on game day requires you to wear many
hats, and this chapter runs down all your tasks. We share the details on meet-
ing with the opposing coach and referees; delivering pregame pep talks and
remaining a constant source of motivation throughout the game; substituting
players; instructing kids in a positive fashion during the action; making half-
time adjustments; and ensuring that you send the kids home happy, regard-
less of what the scoreboard says. As you can see, a lot goes on during game
day, and this chapter makes sure that you’ll be on top of it all.
Taking Care of Pregame Business
Before you can send your players out on the field to compete in the game,
you have to tend to some important pregame responsibilities, which range
from inspecting the field to meeting with the opposing coach and the offi-
cials. Read on for more details to make sure you have these areas covered.

Checking the field
Ensuring the safety of your players, as well as those from the opposing team,
should always be a top priority of any youth lacrosse coach. So before the
game, inspect the playing area for broken glass, rocks, raised sprinkler heads,
loose pieces of sod, and any other hazards that pose an injury risk to players.
You can ask your assistant coaches or some parents to help you check the
field so that the inspection doesn’t monopolize all your time.
Don’t rely on the opposing coach or the grounds crew to do the field inspec-
tion. Every step you can take to help ensure the kids’ safety is crucial.
In many lacrosse programs, games are played in rapid succession, but don’t
skirt the pregame field check just because another game was just played
there. Even if someone has already checked the playing area, having another
set of eyes look it over never hurts. Also, all the traffic on the field may have
torn up chunks of grass that could trip young players if the grass isn’t
replaced properly before the next game gets under way.
Meeting with opposing 
coaches and referees
Before the ball is in play and your players are tearing up and down the field,
head over to meet the opposing coach and shake hands with him, as well as
any assistants. This meeting is a wonderful demonstration of good sports-
manship; it also sets a good example for the players on both teams, as well as
for the parents and other spectators. While you’re over there, take the time
to find out whether any players on the opposing team have any special needs
that you and your players should be aware of or any accommodations that
need to be made.
Meeting with the referees who will officiate your game provides another
example of some good pregame sportsmanship. When introducing yourself to
the officials, let them know that you want to be informed if any of your play-
ers (or parents) says or does anything unsportsmanlike during the course of
the game. You want to work with the officials — not against them. Even
though they’re wearing striped shirts and you’re donning a coach’s cap,
you’re all involved in youth lacrosse because you care about kids and want to
make the experience as rewarding as possible for them.
During your meeting with the officials, alert them if any child on your team
has special needs. Officials can make the proper adjustments when they
know this information beforehand. If one of your players has a hearing prob-
lem and won’t be able to hear a whistle, for example, the official knows to use
a hand signal for this child to get her attention.
142
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Getting Their Game On: The 
Pregame Team Meeting
A team meeting helps get everyone in the right frame of mind before the
game gets under way. In the following sections, we take a look at all the areas
you need to cover during this meeting to help set the tone for a great day of
lacrosse for all your players, as well as yourself.
Checking equipment
Amid all the excitement surrounding game day, kids sometimes forget an
important piece of equipment, such as a mouthpiece. During your talk with
the team, do a quick equipment check to make sure that all the players have
what they need. Beyond the obvious equipment basics — such as sticks and
head gear — check to verify that the players have their mouth guards and
water bottles on hand, too.
It’s a good idea to enforce a team rule that every child must bring a water
bottle to all practices and games, with his name clearly marked on the bottle.
Besides being important so kids remain hydrated during the game, you don’t
want them spreading germs by drinking out of the same bottles.
At the more advanced levels of play, make sure that the kids have cleats that
meet league regulations. As we discuss in Chapter 2, children should never
be allowed on the field to participate in a practice or compete in a game with-
out all the proper safety equipment.
Inspiring the players with 
your pregame talk
As a lacrosse coach, you want your players to be excited about playing and
ready to give everything they have when the game begins. Sometimes,
though, kids require a boost to get motivated to chase down those loose balls
or sprint back on defense after an opponent bursts past them. That’s where
the pregame motivational talk comes in.
Getting the best effort out of your players every time they take the field will
be a challenge at times, but you’re fully capable of meeting the challenge.
Just keep in mind that your motivational talk needs to pull the players
together as a team. Following are some tips to ensure that your pregame
words hit home and produce the responses you are aiming for.

Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

Minimize distractions
Kids have short attention spans, so any time you’re speaking with them, you
don’t want to be competing with anything that can monopolize their atten-
tion and detract from what you’re trying to get across. Whenever you’re
having a pregame chat, gather the kids in the spot that has the fewest distrac-
tions. Your players won’t be the least bit interested in what you’re saying if
they can see their parents or other family members milling around nearby.
Also, keep your distance from the other team. Kids naturally want to check
out the opposition, which is another distraction you don’t want to contend
with.
Keep it short
Always keep in mind that the kids didn’t show up on game day to listen to
you talk or to be subjected to long-winded speeches. They’re there to play a
game. Keep your talk to less than 5 minutes. Anything longer than that, and
you risk defusing their energy and enthusiasm for the game.
Swipe the good material
Reflect on your playing days in lacrosse (or any other sport) and the
pregame talks that really made an impression on you. Steal from the good
ones, and stay away from those that left a bad impression, and you’ll have
the makings of a pregame message that fulfills your intentions.
Make the message fit the audience
Target your message to your audience; otherwise, you’re wasting your play-
ers’ time. The younger the players on the team, the more basic your words
must be. At the more-advanced levels of play, you can get a little more in-
depth on what you want to address with the players.
Dump the clichés
Clichés like “No pain, no gain” will probably produce more than a few blank
stares from your players. Just go with your instincts, and speak from the
heart with genuine passion. You don’t need to resort to worn-out phrases,
which are more likely to cause confusion.
Make it all about your team
Center your talk on your team, your players, and your confidence in them.
Positive reinforcement of their skills can provide them the extra boost of con-
fidence they need to perform up to their capabilities. It also has more impact
than covering the strengths and weaknesses of an opposing team that they
may know very little about.
144
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Blanket the conversation in positives
Make sure that everything that comes out of your mouth is positive and
uplifting. Talk about areas of the game in which the team has excelled lately,
and tell your players you can’t wait to see them put those skills into action.
Don’t allow any doubts and insecurities to creep into the players’ minds.
Deliver it just before the game
Make sure that you deliver your chat moments before the game instead of
before your warm-ups. You don’t want to waste your words by pumping up
the players for their warm-up; you want the kids heading into the game riding
a wave of positive energy.
Relax — and remind the kids to have fun
Speak to the team in a calm, relaxed manner. If you’re nervous or uptight,
your players will be, too, which infringes on their performance. If you’re smil-
ing and laughing, the players will approach the game in a much more relaxed
way, which usually leads to better play on the field.
Be clear that you want the kids to have a good time playing, whether they’re
up by six goals or trailing by that many. When kids genuinely believe that
having fun is important, they play more loosely — and usually more effec-
tively — because they’re not afraid of making mistakes or losing games.
Briefly recap the warm-up
Verbally run through the pregame warm-up quickly to refresh the kids’ mem-
ories on the order of the drills so you don’t have to waste valuable time
explaining them once you’re on the field. (For more on the type of warm-ups
your players should be performing to get properly loosened up for competi-
tion, check out Chapter 7.)
Emphasize sportsmanship
You want the team you put on the field to model good sportsmanship at all
times, regardless of the score of the game or what is going on in it. That
includes respecting the officials, regardless of what calls they make. Remind
players of the importance of being good sports and being a team that others
in the league will strive to emulate each time out.
Wrap up with your team cheer
Conclude with a team cheer, such as “One . . . two . . . three . . . team!” or
“Together!” The cheer’s a symbolic gesture reminding the players that they
need to work together.
145
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

Warming up
Although injuries are part of a contact sport like lacrosse, and they’re out of
your control when the game begins, pregame warm-ups help minimize the
risk. The older the players on your team are, the more susceptible they are to
pulling or straining muscles. A well-designed, pregame warm-up stretches the
kids’ muscles, loosens their bodies, and gradually elevates their heart rates.
It also helps them perform to the best of their ability during the game.
The goal of any pregame warm-up is to prepare kids for competition, reduce
the chance of injury, and prep them to perform their best. Warm-ups con-
ducted in a positive environment can give players confidence and have them
looking forward to performing similar skills during the game.
During your practice sessions leading up to game day, spend a few minutes
going over your pregame warm-up. You don’t want to waste valuable time
before the game organizing players, introducing drills, and giving lengthy
instructions on how to perform certain stretches.
Keep the following tips in mind when putting together your pregame 
warm-up:
Before beginning the stretches, be sure to have the players do some light run-
ning in place or some jumping jacks to get their bodies warmed up.
 Hit all the major muscle groups. The stretches need to cover all the
major muscle groups, including the hamstrings, calves, neck, arms, and
back. See Chapter 7 for some specific stretches you can use.
 Pump up the kids’ confidence. While your players are stretching, work
your way around the group and provide a little extra encouragement
that they can take with them onto the field that day. A pat on the back, a
wink, or a general comment about how you’re looking forward to watch-
ing them play gives them an extra little shot of confidence that can make
a big difference in their play and how much they enjoy the game. Even
general comments directed at the entire team can produce positive
results when the game action heats up.
 Keep the drills light. After the kids are stretched out, you want them to
work into the drills gradually. When attackers are running with the ball,
for example, you want them moving at half their normal speed for sev-
eral repetitions and working their way up to top speed. If kids go full
speed throughout the entire warm-up, they’ll be gasping for breath by
the time the game begins.
146
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Cover all the skills. Besides getting your players loosened up, you want
to get them comfortable performing all the skills that will be required of
them during the game. You don’t want to send your attackers out on the
field without having caught a pass on the run — a skill they’ll be counted
on to perform throughout the game. And your defensive players will be
unprepared if they begin a game without having done any type of run-
ning and cutting in different directions — a skill that they’ll use often
during games to stick with attacking opponents who charge down the
field with the ball.
You simply want to loosen the kids up for competition — not have them
run around as they would during an actual game.
 Allow time to drink fluids. Don’t conduct your warm-ups right up until
the start of the game so that kids don’t even have a chance to catch
their breath. Give players a minute or two to get a drink of water and
compose themselves before they head onto the field.
Coaching a Great Game
We’re confident that your pregame talk will motivate your players to perform
at their top level and that your quality warm-up will get them loosened up the
right way, prepared for competition. But when the game begins, all sorts of
new challenges fall squarely on your shoulders, some of which you may not
have given much thought to. Motivating players, orchestrating substitutions
to ensure equal playing time, communicating plays, and making changes in
strategy are just some of the areas you need to take care of during the heat of
the action.
This section shows you what awaits you and how you can fulfill all your
responsibilities to help your players benefit from their participation.
Motivating your players
A great pregame speech that excites the kids and has them charging out onto
the field ready to play is a great way to begin the game, but you need to keep
that energetic level of play going all game long, even on those days when
nothing seems to go your team’s way. Being a constant source of motivation
for the players helps keep them involved in every aspect of the game at both
the offensive and defensive ends of the field.
Keep the following tips in mind to help motivate your players throughout the
game.
147
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

Give them freedom to make mistakes
That’s right — mistakes! Because mistakes are part of lacrosse and can’t be
prevented, allow your players to make some during the course of the action
without showing any frustration on your part.
Give them some space
Giving instructions every second of the game puts the brakes on players’
development; they need some space to think and react on their own to what
is unfolding in the game. Giving youngsters freedom to play and to make
some decisions of their own fuels their growth, enhances their learning, and
deepens their love of the game.
Rest the vocal cords
Grabbing for the throat lozenges after games isn’t a good sign. Part of being a
good coach is keeping your emotions in check and refraining from spending
the entire game shouting instructions to every player on the field.
Constantly hearing your voice can wear players down. Sure, sometimes you
need to get a player’s attention, and increasing the volume is warranted. Just
be sure to convey the instruction in a calm manner, because the louder your
voice, the less effective the message may be for a young player. Also make
sure that you deliver your message in a positive fashion.
Limit your sideline running
Don’t use game day as a chance to fit in exercise by running up and down the
sidelines. At specific points in the game, you may want to encourage your
team to push the ball down the field quickly by running along the sideline,
exuding positive words of encouragement and clapping your hands. That’s
perfectly OK. This type of behavior becomes a problem only when you’re
doing it the entire game, which can be a major distraction to players who are
doing their best to focus on the game.
If you find yourself covering as much ground during the game as your players
do, give yourself a breather. That move will be healthy for both you and your
team.
Be positive with your feedback
Keep in mind that how players respond to your feedback during games can
much different from the way they react during a midweek practice, simply
because of all the extra people around. It can be upsetting for a youngster to
get singled out in front of family members, strangers, and the opposing team;
choose your words carefully so that the youngster’s psyche isn’t damaged.
148
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

If an attacker isn’t following through on his passes, for example, offer some
instruction in a positive manner. Say something like this: “Cameron, remem-
ber to follow through toward your target just like you did so well in practice
this week.” By taking this approach, you provide the player feedback that
enhances his play during the game — and also give him a boost of confidence
by pointing out how well he performed the skill earlier in the week.
Applaud hustle
Players can’t control how many goals they score or limit an opponent to a
specific number of scores. The one factor that they do have full control of is
how hard they play and hustle on both offense and defense. You never want
your players to be outhustled by the opposition; effort isn’t controlled by
talent or athleticism, so a team really has no reason to get outperformed in
that area.
Your least talented players can have the greatest impact on the game by hus-
tling and giving it their all. So applaud your players’ work ethic enthusiasti-
cally, and reward their hustle with applause and praise. When you instill this
attitude in your entire team, they’ll reward you with their best effort at all
times. You can always correct improper techniques or missed assignments,
but only the players themselves control how much effort they put into every
play and how deeply they really care about doing their best. Let kids know
that even though they’ll make mistakes, you want them to make those mis-
takes going at full speed and with 100-percent effort.
Communicating plays
Any time your team has possession of the ball, it has an opportunity to score
a goal, so you always want the players focused on getting the best possible
shot. Sometimes, you’ll want to run a play in an attempt to create a scoring
chance. At advanced levels of play, you may notice a defensive tendency of
the opposition that you can exploit with a particular play in your arsenal.
(For a rundown on some of the types of plays you can run, such as using
checks to create openings and attacking from behind the net, check out
Chapter 15.)
Whatever method you use to communicate plays, be sure to use it during
your practice sessions, too. Just as kids need practice passing and defending,
they need practice deciphering your hand signals from the sideline and exe-
cuting the play.
149
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

At the beginning levels of play, children are there simply to learn the basics of
lacrosse and have fun chasing up and down the field. Steer clear of bombard-
ing them with an avalanche of plays that they won’t be able to remember
when game day rolls around. At more-advanced levels, you can introduce a
series of plays for the kids to learn and use against opponents. Experienced
players will enjoy the challenge of learning plays, practicing them during the
week, and putting them in action on game day — and perhaps seeing their
efforts pay off in goals.
Making player substitutions
Most lacrosse programs allow coaches to make unlimited substitutions
during games, particularly at beginning levels of play, to help ensure that the
kids receive an equal amount of playing time and don’t feel that they’re
stranded on the bench for unbearable amounts of time. Being familiar with
your league’s rules (which we discuss in Chapter 2) is crucial that so you
know whether any special rules regarding substitutions are in place.
When making substitutions, try to bring kids out after they do something well
rather than when they make a mistake or simply get beaten by the opposing
player on a move. If you bring a player to the bench shortly after she made
an errant pass, she’ll relate making mistakes to losing playing time, which can
make her less assertive on the field.
When you bring a player to the sideline, give him a pat on the back or a high
five recognizing all the effort he’s putting forth. Kids love those kinds of
receptions, and those gestures keep their enthusiasm running high so that
they’ll be eager to re-enter the game and continue giving a strong effort.
Employing advanced strategy 
for older players
The older and more advanced the players on your team are, the more
chances you have to incorporate more sophisticated offensive and defensive
techniques. At higher levels of play, you can introduce plays to set up when
your team crosses midfield or when it’s attacking from behind the net, for
example. Picks are also a great way to free up players for open shots. You’ll
find details on executing these types of plays in Chapter 15 and the scoop on
how to defend them in Chapter 16.
150
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

During your practices, you want to work with your team on running several
types of plays so that regardless of the situation, you’ve got something to call
for them to run during a game. But spend a little extra time nailing down one
or two plays that your team is confident about performing. These plays are
the ones you’ll rely on when your team is trailing by a goal late in the game.
When a team has a special play to turn to when the game is on the line, it has
a greater chance of depositing the ball in the net.
When working on plays with your team during your practices, don’t fall into
the habit of designing them all for your most talented player to wind up
shooting the ball. You want to spread those shots around. By doing so, not
only do you include more players on your team in the action and make them
feel that much more valued and appreciated for their efforts, but a team that
possesses a balanced scoring attack that can shoot from anywhere on the
field — from any player’s stick — is much more difficult for defenses to stop.
If an opponent always knows that shots are going to come from one particu-
lar player, it will adjust accordingly, and your offense won’t have many
options at its disposal if you haven’t practiced a variety of plays that feature
several different shooters.
Pumping Them Up: The Halftime Speech
During the first half of a game, you’ll see everything from players scoring goals
(ideally, for your team) to passes being dropped and penalties being called
(ideally, on the other team). If you’re coaching beginning-level lacrosse, you
may even witness goalies checking out birds in the sky rather than the ball
rolling past them into the net. A lot happens during the course of play, so
when halftime arrives, you have a lot of information to sift through — and usu-
ally not much time to chat with the team before it returns to the field for the
second half.
Following are some tips to keep in mind when gathering your troops during
halftime to help ensure that the time is productive, enlightening, and benefi-
cial, and that it leads to a strong team effort for the remainder of the game:
 Rehearse what you want to say. Because halftime breaks usually are
short, you typically won’t have a lot of time with your players. On your
way to the locker room or the bench area where teams gather for the
break, think about what you want to get across. That way, you’ll know
exactly what you want to say when you stand up in front of the kids and
won’t waste time searching for the right words.
 Make sure the players consume fluids first. Give players time to drink
some fluids before you begin your halftime talk. Having a chance to
quench their thirst and catch their breath makes them more receptive to
your comments.
151
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

 Keep the message short and simple. What you say during your halftime
chat should be clear, concise, and uplifting. Your players were just out
on the field, and they know what happened, so don’t waste valuable time
recapping everything that transpired. If you limit the amount of informa-
tion you throw at your team, your words are more likely to sink in. The
last thing you want to do is send your team back on the field over-
whelmed and confused about what you want them to do.
 Match the team’s mood. The most effective halftime talks are those that
match the mood of the team. If your team is trailing by several goals, for
example, many of the kids may have their heads down in disappoint-
ment. You’ve got to revive their enthusiasm, using positive, uplifting
words to get them to believe in themselves again. Even though the play-
ers may not have scored as many goals as they would have liked, point
out the positives in their play and remind them that through hard work,
they’ll be able to capitalize on scoring opportunities a little better in the
second half.
Conversely, if your team played a great first half and has a comfortable
margin to work with, you don’t need to give a rah-rah speech. Instead,
acknowledge how well everyone performed, and remind the players to
maintain their concentration and focus on duplicating that effort when
they get back on the field for the second half.
 Keep your emotions level. Even if you’re frustrated by how the team is
playing — and all lacrosse coaches will endure those days from time to
time — never let the team know, because that can kill morale and wipe
out any chance for the kids to bounce back and play a better second
half. Losing a grip on your emotions detracts from your ability to coach
and interact effectively with your players. Whether your team is way
ahead or way behind, maintain a positive attitude and demeanor.
 Make necessary adjustments. At the more-advanced levels of lacrosse,
one of your biggest halftime challenges is making adjustments based on
what went right — and not so right — during the opening half of play.
Focus on finding solutions and fixing problems rather than making
speeches.
 Solicit input from players. You can’t possibly monitor every single thing
that takes place on the field. If you’re coaching an advanced-level team,
your players can help. Asking them whether they have any suggestions
to employ in the second half reinforces your respect for them and their
knowledge of the game, and you may gain some valuable feedback that
benefits the team.
 Factor in the field conditions. Sometimes, you have to tweak your strat-
egy to fit the weather or the condition of the field. If the playing area has
become wet and slippery, and your team typically plays a very aggres-
sive style of defense, you may have to resort to a more-passive
approach, because the conditions don’t allow them to maintain their
footing as easily.
152
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

 Adjust to the striped shirts. Different referees officiate games different
ways, and your players have to adjust accordingly. Make note of how the
game is being called, and make any necessary adjustments in your
team’s approach. If the referee is calling a lot of penalties, for example,
your team will be better off toning down its aggressiveness just a bit so
that it doesn’t put itself in difficult short-handed situations.
Being a Good Sport
One of the many interesting aspects of playing a lacrosse game is that every
contest produces a winner and a loser (except in beginning-level programs,
which don’t keep score). Showing your team how to win and lose with class
and dignity transcends your instructions on the proper way to deliver a
check or make an accurate shot on goal from long distance. Children must
understand that they can leave the field feeling good about themselves —
regardless of the score — if they gave 100-percent effort and performed the
best they could.
Have team chats in which you discuss the importance of playing fairly, abid-
ing by the rules, and behaving gracefully in both victory and defeat. Review
the right ways to congratulate a winning team and how to behave when
they’re celebrating a victory themselves. Ask your players how they want to
be treated when they’ve lost and how they should treat their opponents
when they’re the winning team. Opening the door to these types of discus-
sions helps your players clearly understand what acceptable behavior is and
clears the way for them to exhibit manners that make you proud.
Winning gracefully
Lacrosse teams are remembered not only for how well they played in the
game, but also for how they behaved in it. Youth lacrosse has no place for
showboating or excessive celebration. Considering all the readily available
examples of poor sportsmanship by professional athletes, showing children
the art of winning with grace may be one of your most challenging tasks as a
lacrosse coach.
Lacrosse is a physical game, and any time contact is involved, emotions tend
to run high. You need to show your team how to celebrate good plays without
coming across as taunting the opponent. Your players need to know that cele-
brating a goal is OK. After all, kids are naturally excited about performing well
in a game, and you don’t want to curb their enthusiasm for doing well. The key
is making sure that the excitement and energy are shared among your team,
not directed at the opposition. When one of your players scores a goal, for
example, she can high five her teammates, and they can congratulate one
153
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

another. The celebration crosses into the territory of poor sportsmanship if
the player who scored the goal looks over at the opposing goalie while cele-
brating or makes any type of comment or gesture to any player on the oppos-
ing team.
Sometimes, you’ll find a pretty significant gap between the skills of the play-
ers on the competing teams, so being a good sport when these mismatches
are in your favor is important. If your team is dominating an opponent that
simply doesn’t have the talent or skills to compete, do everything you can
not to pile on the goals and embarrass the other team. That behavior reflects
terribly on you and your team, and it serves no purpose in the development
of your players. Remember, next week your team could go up against a vastly
superior opponent, and you wouldn’t want your kids to be demoralized.
If you find yourself in a lopsided game, consider some of the following
approaches to keep your team’s interest level high, work on a broad range of
skills, and avoid humiliating the opponent in the process:
 Sit the starters. If you’re coaching an advanced-level lacrosse team, put
your starters on the bench, and give the kids on the second and third
string (the nonstarters) plenty of action.
 Rotate players. Give kids the chance to play positions that they haven’t
had a lot of experience with to this point in the season. This change
allows them to work on different aspects of their game and provides new
challenges.
 Practice a new defense. If your team is stopping the opposition’s attack
with ease and forcing lots of errant passes, switch up your defense. If
you’ve been playing man-to-man, mix up your approach by going with a
zone defense that you haven’t been able to devote much time to in prac-
tice. (For more details on coaching defense, flip to Chapter 16.)
 Work on weaker skills. Encourage your players to focus on areas of
their game that could use additional work. If a player isn’t proficient at
making passes to a player on the move, for example, have him look for
teammates who are on the move and then try to deliver the ball to them.
Losing gracefully
Learning to win with grace is a fairly easy lesson; losing with class can be a
little more challenging for young players. You and your players would love to
win every time you take the field — what coach or team wouldn’t? — but
that’s simply not going to happen. The best coaches and the best teams
suffer losses.
154
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

There’s nothing wrong with losing a game, but there’s plenty wrong with
behaving as though losing is the worst thing in the world. Crying, throwing
equipment, blaming the officials, swearing, and refusing to shake hands with
the opposing team are examples of behavior that you simply can’t tolerate.
(Jump to Chapter 18 to find out more about dealing with some of these types
of behaviors.)
Regardless of what transpires on the field, have your players line up and
shake hands with the opposing team at the conclusion of the game. This dis-
play of good sportsmanship can be difficult for players who just gave their
best efforts and came up short. Yet showing respect for opponents is impor-
tant for your players’ overall development — not only as lacrosse players,
but as people, too. Encourage your players to acknowledge a well-played
game by the opposition. Remind them to keep everything in perspective; next
time, they could be on the winning end.
Regardless of how arrogant the opposing team may be, your players should
always rise above that type of behavior. As difficult as this is at times — and
that goes for you, too — always offer a congratulatory handshake or high five
to the other kids. Being sincere in the face of adversity or a loss is a great
attribute. The same thing goes for shaking the officials’ hands after the game.
Sending Them Home Happy: 
The Postgame Talk
What you say to your team following a game and how you say it have a big
impact on the kids, because that message resonates in their heads until the
next time they take the field. Regardless of how the game turns out, one of
your most important tasks is sending the players on their way feeling good
about themselves. Pats on the back, lots of encouraging words, and genuine
smiles are always well received by kids in any postgame chat. When they 
feel appreciated for their efforts, playing for you gives kids a real sense of 
satisfaction.
Keeping the focus on fun
Ensuring that every child has fun every time he steps on the field is one of
your top priorities. Be sure to keep a close eye on whether the entire team
had an enjoyable experience.
155
Chapter 8: Making Game Day Memorable — For the Right Reasons

A great way to gauge the fun factor is to ask players randomly whether they
had fun. Ideally, you’ll get a chorus of enthusiastic responses. If so, poll the
players to find out what they enjoyed most about the game. If some kids
don’t answer quite as enthusiastically as others, immediately find out why
they didn’t have the same amount of fun.
After you gather this information, be sure to make any necessary adjust-
ments to ensure that all your players will have smiles on their faces at your
next game.
A child may not have enjoyed the experience on the field for a variety of rea-
sons. Maybe she was really hoping to score a goal while her dad was in the
stands, and she misfired on a good opportunity. Or perhaps he got knocked
to the ground hard by an opposing player. Always take the time to solicit
feedback, gauge feelings, and probe for answers when you sense that a child
did not derive much satisfaction from game day. Sometimes, part of being a
good lacrosse coach is being a detective, so keep those communication lines
open. Find out whatever information you can to make sure that your players’
experience continues to be fun — or returns to being fun — before your next
game.
Accentuating the positive
Never rely on the scoreboard to dictate your mood when you interact with
the team following a game. How much your team won or lost by doesn’t
define its effort, how it’s improving, or how much fun it had playing.
Following losses, fight the urge to dwell on the negative and everything the
kids did wrong. Just push those thoughts to the side. Your players were out
there on the field running around and are well aware of what happened. They
certainly don’t need a recap of their errant passes or their lapses on defense
that led to goals by the opposition.
Whether the team played its best game of the season or got clobbered, part
of your job is pointing out good things that happened that the team can build
on. Perhaps your defense did an outstanding job of keeping the opponent
away from the middle of the field, or maybe your attackers made quick, accu-
rate passes that kept the opponent off balance. By keeping your comments
positive, your body language buoyant, and your tone of voice upbeat, you
can send kids home feeling good about themselves. They’ll also be eager to
return to practice in the coming days to continue working on their game.
156
Part II: Fielding a Lacrosse Team 

Recognizing good sportsmanship
Your team’s ability to execute the fundamentals of the game is a direct reflec-
tion on you as a coach, as is how they behave toward the opponents and
their coach during and after games. So be sure to touch on sportsmanship in
your postgame chat.
Recognizing the kids who made the spectacular defensive plays or executed
the passes that led to the goals is the easy part, because they stand out in
your mind after the game. A little more difficult, but equally important, is rec-
ognizing the displays of good sportsmanship that occurred during the game.
Showing your appreciation for good behavior reinforces the importance of
displaying good sportsmanship at all times.
Always be on the lookout for examples of good sportsmanship, and make
mental notes when they occur during the course of play. One of your players
may have said “Nice save” to an opposing goalie after she stopped a good
scoring chance from in close, or she may have congratulated an opponent
who turned in a really strong performance. You can even mention displays of
good sportsmanship by the opposing team, which further reinforces how
important it is to you. Making your players aware of sportsmanship sends the
all-important message that good conduct is as important as good passing,
shooting, and defending.

ood lacrosse coaches possess many good qualities — patience, caring,
and enthusiasm, to name a few — but if you’re not also a competent
teacher of skills, you’ll be about as successful as Wile E. Coyote was trying to
nab the Road Runner.
In this chapter, we start from square one, covering the basic offensive skills
that every young lacrosse player needs to enjoy some level of success on the
field. We go over the chief skills pertaining to cradling, passing, catching,
shooting, scooping up loose balls, and winning face-offs.
Focusing Your Approach for First-Timers
When children are learning how to spell, teachers don’t start them with
multisyllable words; instead, they start children with basic, one-syllable
words like cat and dog. You should stick with the same approach in coaching
the offensive skills of lacrosse. You want to start with the basics of the game —
not what’s taught at the high-school or college level — and slowly build on
those skills and techniques.
More than likely, you’ll be with your team for just a few hours each week, so
be realistic in your expectations. Coaches typically have younger children for
only one practice and one game each week, which doesn’t leave time to cram
a lot of information into their young heads, so the more basic you can keep
your instructions to them, the better.

Lacrosse has a unique language all its own, and using unfamiliar terms and
phrases may confuse kids. Stick to terms that you’ve taken the time to
explain clearly and that you can confidently say all the kids on the team
understand. (For more on the basic terms and rules of lacrosse, check out
Chapter 3.)
Mastering the Basics
No question about it — kids enjoy having the ball and being on the attack
much more than they do trying to stop an opponent from scoring. To take
advantage of possessions, though, they must have a good grasp of the offen-
sive fundamentals. When players don’t understand the basics of cradling,
passing, and catching, for example, those chinks in your team’s offensive
armor will lead to turnovers and missed opportunities. This section covers
all the offensive basics that your players need to enjoy success when they get
their sticks on the ball.
Cradling
A player who can’t move around the field without losing control of the ball
isn’t going to be very effective or have much fun playing lacrosse. Read on to
get the lowdown on the proper techniques for executing a variety of cradles,
as well as the best opportunities for using them and ways to troubleshoot
problems that kids are having with them.
Helping kids execute different cradles
How important is cradling? Very. It allows players to move around on the field
at top speed while carrying the ball or to control the ball in heavy traffic while
defenders try to swipe it. Players won’t be effective in passing or shooting until
they master the basics of cradling, which the following sections review. Different
situations during the game dictate the types of cradle techniques that players
should use.
Horizontal cradle
A horizontal cradle (sometimes referred to as a small cradle) is a basic motion
of the arms and wrists that players use while controlling the ball; it’s the easi-
est cradling technique to learn. A player uses a horizontal cradle primarily
when he wants to move the ball to the top of the pocket on his stick to
deliver a pass or take a shot. Here’s how it works:
162
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

1. The player holds the stick in front of his body (see Figure 9-1).
His bottom hand holds the end of his stick, and his top hand is near the
throat of the stick.
2. He rolls the wrist of his top hand upward toward his chest.
3. He rotates his arm and wrist back toward the field (see Figure 9-2).
This motion creates the centrifugal force that holds the ball in the
pocket.

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Because this position isn’t the best one to shoot or pass from, players can
also use the horizontal cradle at shoulder height. A left-hander would execute
it the following way:
1. The player places her right hand at the end of the stick (see 
Figure 9-3) and holds the stick horizontal to the field.
Her left hand grips the stick just below the midpoint.
2. She rotates the wrist of her top hand side to side.
This motion allows her to get a feel for where the ball is in the pocket of
her stick — without looking at it — before setting up to shoot or pass.
Two-handed vertical cradle
When players are on the move, either running down the field with the ball or
attacking in the opponent’s end of the field, the two-handed vertical cradle is
the primary option. Here’s how it works:
1. The player holds the stick near the throat with his top hand (see
Figure 9-4), with the pocket above his shoulder and at ear level.
His bottom hand grips the butt end of the stick.
Figure 9-3:

2. He rotates his top wrist first toward his body and then away from it.
This motion keeps the ball in the pocket of the stick.
One-handed vertical cradle
When players are attacking the net, this technique provides maximum pro-
tection of the ball and makes the defender’s job much more difficult. Here’s
how it works:
1. A left-handed player holds the stick with his left hand near the throat
(see Figure 9-5) if he’s attacking to his right.
The thumb points up, while the other fingers grasp the stick.
2. He holds the ball at about shoulder level and uses his free arm to pro-
tect his stick. (See Figure 9-6.)

Correcting cradling problems
The No. 1 problem kids have with cradling is keeping their eyes glued on the
ball when it’s in the stick. As a result, they can’t see the defender charging
toward them or a wide-open teammate downfield who is in great scoring posi-
tion. During your drills, hammer home to players the importance of keeping
their heads up and their eyes scanning the field. Encourage them to resist the
urge to glance back at their sticks; eventually, they will know by feel where
the ball is on the stick.
Passing
Some kids enjoy passing the ball about as much as being told to clean up
their bedrooms, simply because when the ball isn’t on their sticks, they don’t
have a chance to shoot it. Yet the better your team is at passing the ball, the
more chances everyone will get to score goals. Make that point clear to your
team and then get to work showing them the techniques of passing.
Grip
Both hands are important in passing, so holding the stick properly is key. 
A right-hander relies on her right hand to control the direction of the pass,
because that hand is her top hand on the stick; the left hand generates the
bulk of the force for the pass. The bottom hand grips the butt end of the
stick.
Stance
Players keep their feet shoulder width apart to maintain good balance. In
boys’ leagues that allow checking, this stance also makes it more difficult for
opponents to knock the player off balance.
Stick position
When a player is ready to deliver a pass, she cradles the ball so that it gets
positioned in the center of her stick’s pocket (see Figure 9-7). While she is
positioning the ball, she brings her stick back behind her head.
167
Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Delivering the ball to a 
teammate standing still
When the player has the ball in the proper position and the stick behind his
head, he’s ready to execute a pass. Here’s how he gets the ball to his target:
1. The player extends his top hand and follows through toward the
target, using his bottom hand to pull the shaft of his stick down and
toward his body.
2. He turns his body slightly and steps toward the target with the foot
opposite his top hand (see Figure 9-8). A right-hander, for example,
would step with his left foot.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Delivering the ball to a 
teammate on the run
Often during games, players are forced to deliver passes to teammates who
are on the move, which presents a few more challenges than passing to a
stationary player. The secret of making an accurate pass to a moving player
is picking out a target at stick height in front of the player, based on how fast
she is moving. This technique is difficult to teach, because the passer must
factor in how far she is from the player, as well as judge how fast she is moving.
All skills require lots of practice for players to become comfortable performing
them in the heat of the action on game day — particularly this one. Be sure
that your practices incorporate lots of drills in which players must pass the
ball to moving teammates. (Check out Chapter 14 for a sampling of some
drills that you can use.)
When a player misfires on a pass, you prefer him to miss by delivering it too
far out in front of his teammate, rather than behind him. When the ball is
passed too far out in front, the intended recipient still has a chance to beat
the defender to it and secure possession, but when the ball is passed behind
him, the opponent can scoop it up and race in the other direction with it.

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Executing passes on the move
Players rarely have the luxury of passing while standing still during games,
because defenders will force them to be on the move, looking for openings.
Here’s how to make accurate passes while on the move:
1. The player pulls her stick back to the top-hand side of her body.
A right-hander with her right hand on top of the stick, for example, posi-
tions the stick on her right side (see Figure 9-9).
2. She twists her body slightly to the right.
This move helps protect the ball from defenders.
3. She steps forward with her left foot toward the target, twisting at the
hips and rotating her shoulders to face the target (see Figure 9-10).
4. She delivers the pass and follows through with her top arm pointing
at the target.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Sidearm passes
When players are being pressured by a defender, the sidearm pass is an
effective way to get the ball to a teammate. Here’s how it’s done:
1. The player grips the butt end of his stick with his left hand, if he is a
right-hander, while his top hand grabs the stick at about its midpoint
(see Figure 9-11).

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

2. When his right hand is on top of the stick, he steps toward the target
with his left foot.
3. He flicks the wrist of his top hand toward the target while uncoiling
his body in that direction.
Flip passes
This pass is similar to the sidearm pass but is delivered below the waist at a
lower angle. This pass is a good one to use when players are covered tightly
and need to get the ball to a teammate in close quarters. Here’s how it’s 
executed:
1. The player drops her stick below waist level (see Figure 9-12).
2. She angles her stick toward the ground, with the pocket of the stick
facing the sky.
3. When her right hand is on top, she steps forward with her left foot
(see Figure 9-13).
4. She snaps her right wrist up toward the target while releasing the ball.

Correcting passing problems
Delivering passes to teammates can be a challenging skill to learn, simply
because of the many types of passes and the many aspects involved in
executing them. The following tips can help your players overcome some of
typically passing problems:
 Passes don’t have much force behind them. The secret of getting a lot of
force behind passes is using the legs. Many kids stand still while delivering
passes, which drains all the power out of the passes. Remind players to
step toward their target, using the foot opposite their main shooting arm.
(A right-handed passer steps toward his target with his left foot, for
example.) The problem can also be the result of a youngster’s failure to
snap the wrist of his top hand as he releases the ball from his stick.
 Passes are hooking. This problem usually can be traced to the fact that
the child is releasing the ball from her stick while it is still behind her
body. This release produces a low, curving pass that either misses the
mark or is more difficult for a teammate to handle. To correct this prob-
lem, have the player focus on hanging on to the ball and not releasing it
until it is next to, or slightly in front of, her body.
Figure 9-13:

173
Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

 Passes are missing their intended targets. When passes are off target,
the problem usually is the player’s follow-through. When the youngster’s
stick doesn’t end up pointing at the target after he releases the ball, the
pass usually doesn’t hit its mark.
 Passes are delivered behind a moving player. Youngsters tend to aim
passes at their teammates’ sticks, so by the time the ball arrives, it is
well behind a player who is running. Remind them to get the ball out in
front; it’s better to miss there than behind the other player, because
she’ll have a better chance to retrieve it.
Catching
Catching passes in lacrosse requires a variety of components: good hand–eye
coordination, proper footwork, and quick reaction to passes that veer a little —
or a lot — off target. (For a refresher on the proper grip, stance, and stick posi-
tion for catching passes, check out Chapter 5.) No matter how skilled your
players are at passing the ball, the offense will sputter if they aren’t equally
proficient at catching it. Share the following information with your players so
they can — we have to say it — catch on to this aspect of the game.
Instill in your players the habit of stepping toward the ball to receive passes.
When players stand still and wait for the ball to reach them, the opponent
has extra time to step in and intercept the pass, or at least get a stick on the
ball and knock it down.
Making weak-side catches
A weak-side catch (also known as a nonstick-side catch) is a useful technique
when a defender is nearby; the player can use his body to shield the oppo-
nent and make the catch. Here’s the method players should use:
1. The player turns toward the direction of the pass, bringing the stick
across his body (see Figure 9-14).
The wrist of his top hand faces his body; his bottom hand is on the
bottom of the stick; and his feet are shoulder width apart.
2. As he receives the ball, he twists his upper body toward his stick and
pulls his arms in toward his body to absorb the pass (see Figure 9-15).

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Making catches on the run
When players are breaking down the field, and someone makes a long pass, the
only way to get a stick on it may be an over-the-shoulder catch. The over-the-
shoulder catch is one of the most difficult to pull off, but here’s how it’s done:
1. The player runs while turning her head toward the ball.
Her bottom hand holds on to the base of the stick, and her top hand is
on the midpoint of the stick.
2. She reaches her stick out away from her body (see Figure 9-16).
3. She keeps her eyes on the ball and watches it go into the pocket of 
her stick.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Correcting catching problems
Becoming comfortable making catches takes a lot of hard work. Here are
some of the most common difficulties kids encounter while learning this skill:
 The ball bounces out of the pocket of the stick. This problem results
when the player holds his stick too rigidly when the ball arrives. To cor-
rect it, have the child pull the stick back toward his body just slightly on
impact. This move helps cushion the force of the pass and allows the
ball to settle into the pocket of the stick rather than carom out.
 The player is unable to get her stick on passes. The culprit here usually
is a lack of preparation on the youngster’s part. Often, the reason is that
the child is carrying her stick too low, so when a pass does come her way,
she wastes time raising her stick to react to it. During practices, when you
see players’ sticks dipping below waist level, remind them to get the sticks
up so that they are always in the best position to react to passes.
 The player has trouble catching long passes. Most likely, the player is
twisting his entire body around to locate the ball, which drains a lot of
his speed. Remind him to keep his body facing forward and to simply
turn his head to spot the ball over his shoulder.
Shooting
Children who are new to lacrosse must know how to shoot the ball correctly
so that when they find themselves in good scoring position, they have the
confidence to make an accurate shot. (For a recap of the basic fundamentals
involved in shooting, turn to Chapter 5.) Following is information on other
types of shots that players will find useful to have in their arsenal — and that
will keep defenders on their toes, because they won’t know what to expect
when your team is on the attack.
Taking a sidearm shot
The overhand shot (check out Chapter 5 for the basics of executing it) gives
players the best chance of directing the ball where they want it to go. The
sidearm shot is another option that players can use to generate more velocity
on their shots, though it sacrifices some accuracy. It’s also more difficult than
the overhand shot to execute on the run. Here’s how the sidearm shot works:
1. The player drops her stick to around mid-chest level.
2. With her right hand (if she’s a left-handed shooter) on the butt end of
the stick, she slides her left hand down the stick (see Figure 9-17).
177
Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

3. She steps toward the goal with the foot opposite her top hand.
4. She pushes her stick forward with her top hand while pulling her
bottom hand toward her body.
5. The player completes the follow-through by swinging her stick across
her body, keeping the stick parallel to the field (see Figure 9-18).

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Taking a long bounce shot
These shots — when executed properly — pose double trouble for goalies,
who must deal with the angle the shot is released from, and decide whether
the shot will bounce up high or skid along the ground. Help your players
master this shot (which also works well in close), and opposing goalies will
have a tough time stopping it:
1. A right-handed shooter grips his stick with his right hand on top and
his left hand on the butt end; his left shoulder points toward the goal
(see Figure 9-19).
2. The player keeps the ball above and behind his head.
3. He steps forward with his left foot toward the goal.
He pushes the stick forward and down with his right hand, while his left
hand pulls the bottom of the stick in toward his stomach.
4. Keeping his left elbow pointed away from his body, he flicks his top
wrist forward to release the ball at a downward angle (see Figure 9-20).
Figure 9-19:

179
Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Taking accurate shots on the run
Players stick to the same fundamentals to execute shots on the run and while
standing still, holding the stick above the head and adjacent to the ear, and
keeping the hands about 12 to 18 inches apart on the stick. Maintaining
proper balance is especially important to maximize power and accuracy.
When your players slip past a defender and have an opening to take a quick
shot, they can use the pop shot, which works well in traffic; the shot requires
no backswing, so a defender a couple of steps behind doesn’t have an easy
opportunity to disrupt it. Here’s how to take a pop shot:
1. The player raises her stick so that the pocket is just above her top-
hand shoulder. Another option is to move the pocket of the stick in
front of her face.
2. She pushes the stick forward with her top hand and then quickly pulls
the stick down toward her body with her bottom hand.
3. To complete the shot, she snaps her top wrist forward, toward the
goal.
Pop shots don’t generate a lot of speed, because they have no backswing or
follow-through, so players should use them only when a defender is chasing
them closely from behind.

Correcting shooting problems
Kids love scoring goals, so any time they are having problems with their
shots, frustration can set in rather quickly. Review the following common
shooting problems so that you are prepared to help get your players’ shots
back on track:
 Shots lack power. Sure, shots are released with the arms, but some of
the power comes from the legs, too. Remind your players to step toward
the goal with the foot opposite their top hand to help generate more
force — and cause more difficulty for the goaltender.
 Goalies are stopping all their shots. Young players shooting the ball
often stare at the area of the net they are aiming at, which goalies will
pick up on. During your shooting drills, train your players to scan the
entire net, not lock their eyes on one spot. This technique forces the
goalie to defend the entire net without being able to cheat in one direction
or the other.
Facing Off
Excelling in the face-off circle can be parlayed into more time possessing the
ball and additional opportunities for the team to score goals. This section
describes how face-offs are handled.
Grip
One of the most common face-off grips is placing the right hand on the throat
of the stick, with the palm facing the sky. The left hand is about 12 to 18
inches away, palm facing down (see Figure 9-21).
Figure 9-21:
The proper
grip for
taking a
face-off.
181
Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Stance
When taking a face-off, players want to crouch low so that they can spring
out of their stances on the official’s whistle and generate enough force to gain
control of the ball. Here’s a glance at the proper stance:
1. The player positions his right elbow inside his right knee and leans
slightly in that direction (see Figure 9-22).
His knees are bent, and most of his weight is on the balls of his feet.
2. He keeps his head down and his eyes on the ball.
Stick position
Using the right grip and taking the proper stance aren’t going to be as effec-
tive if a player doesn’t have her stick in the correct position. Keep the stick
flush against the field. The player’s gloves also touch the field.
In girls’ lacrosse the referee tosses the ball up in the air, and the players raise
their sticks above their heads to go after the ball, similar to a jump ball in
basketball.
Following are some additional tips to help your players enjoy more success
handling face-offs:
 Capitalize on assets. Some players possess outstanding quickness; others’
strength is their . . . well, strength! Whatever a player’s strongest qualities,
he should rely on them most often to enjoy the most success.
 Mix up the moves. The less predictable players are in the face-off
techniques they use, the less likely opposing players are to get a read on
them. Keeping the opposing player off balance helps shift the odds of
controlling the ball in your team’s favor.
Figure 9-22:

crouch

182
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

 Maintain focus. The player taking the face-off must focus all her concen-
tration on the official’s whistle and on grabbing control of the ball. If
she’s peeking at the positioning of her teammates or opposing players,
or looking at you on the sidelines, she is less effective.
Using the trap
The key to executing this technique is performing two moves simultaneously:
drawing the ball backward while rotating the wrist of the top hand over so
that the stick is flat on the field. If a player executes this move quickly enough,
he’ll trap the ball in the pocket of his stick, and he can drag the ball away from
the opposing player and scoop it up (see Figure 9-23). The stronger players
are, the more successful they tend to be with this technique.
Using the draw
To use the draw technique, the player positions the throat of his stick as
close to the ball as possible before the face-off. On the official’s whistle, he
quickly pulls his stick straight back toward his body. When a player executes
this move correctly, the ball is pulled (or drawn) by the netting on the stick
to his side of the circle.
Using the block
Players use this technique when the opponent is attempting to trap the ball.
To execute the block, a player pushes the tip of his stick against the opponent’s
(see Figure 9-24). This move prevents the opponent from turning his stick over
and trapping the ball. Then the player pulls his stick toward his body, sweeping
the ball with it.

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Correcting face-off problems
Teaching kids face-off techniques can present some challenges, partly because
these skills are affected by the ways that opposing players react in game situa-
tions. Here are a couple of problem areas that may pop up among your players
while you provide instruction on this skill:
 Not reacting quickly on the official’s whistle: Kids have short attention
spans, and a big part of being effective in the face-off circle is maintaining
focus. Work with your players to keep their minds on the task at hand.
Even if their minds wander for just a second, that second may be all the
advantage an opponent needs to win the face-off.
 Problems executing the trap: Have the player slide his top hand closer
to the throat of his stick. This maneuver allows him to use his glove to
block his opponent’s stick and trap the ball with his own stick.
Scooping Up Loose Balls
The team that wins the majority of the loose-ball battles generally wins the
game, simply because more possessions translate into more chances to score
goals. (In Chapter 5, we cover the basics of scooping up a loose ball.) Read
on to find out how to show your players the best approach for outdueling
opponents over loose balls:
Figure 9-24:

1. The player turns her back to the defender to shield that player from
the ball (see Figure 9-25).
She holds her stick at waist level and keeps her feet shoulder width
apart to maintain her balance so that the defender can’t move her out of
position and swipe the ball.
2. If she’s unable to scoop the ball due to defensive pressure, she pushes
the ball farther away from the defender with the end of her stick
before making a play on it (see Figure 9-26).

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals

Here are some other points to keep in mind regarding scooping:
 Control the stick. Young players are often tempted to take one hand off
the stick to reach for loose balls. Scooping up a ball one-handed is difficult,
though, and even if a player does pull off this maneuver, an opponent can
knock the ball loose more easily.
 Attack the ball. As you’ve always heard, the shortest route between two
points is a straight line. Instruct your players always to run straight toward
a loose ball, because the more steps they have to take, the less likely the
ball is to end up on their stick.
 Communicate with teammates. When a player recognizes that he’s in
the best position to scoop up a loose ball, he should alert his teammates
by shouting “Ball!” If he reads the situation correctly and makes the call
quickly enough, his teammates can get a jump on their opponents and
move down the field quickly to catch the defense off guard.
Helping a Child Who Just Can’t Catch On
Regardless of how talented or motivated players are, they all encounter
struggles picking up skills. How you handle kids when the learning path
becomes a little bumpy is the true barometer of your coaching ability.
Keep the following points in mind when working with kids who encounter
difficulty catching on to certain skills:
 Reevaluate your approach. Take a closer look at how you’re interacting
with the kids who are having difficulty. Are you spending too much time
talking and not giving them lots of opportunities to practice the skill? Are
you filling their heads with too many thoughts about what to do instead
of keeping the instructions as simple and straightforward as possible? If
the kids are giving maximum effort, the problem probably is more of a
teaching problem than anything else.
 Keep it simple. Keep your instructions short and to the point. Don’t
stray off into long-winded instructions. Children learn more, and
improve faster, by performing skills than by listening to you talk about
how to perform them.
 Rev up the repetitions. The more reps the kids get, the better. Standing
in line watching teammates perform a skill doesn’t compare with doing it
themselves over and over.
 Move players around. Maybe the youngster who’s struggling had her
heart set on being a defender, rather than an attacker. Mix things up for
the youngster; playing a new position may rejuvenate her enthusiasm
and get her more interested in learning all the skills you’re teaching.
186
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

 Never embarrass the child. Don’t allow your tone of voice or body
language to reveal frustration or disappointment, and never make a
spectacle of a child who’s struggling. Most children are well aware of
how their skills stack up to their teammates’; they don’t need you making
their deficiencies stand out even more by signaling them out for extra
work on the sidelines. Try demonstrating the skill again yourself. Besides
being a good refresher for the other players, this just might be enough
to help the youngster who’s struggling.
 Check to see whether they really like playing. Some children simply
don’t enjoy contact sports. Nothing’s wrong with that. A child could be
struggling simply because he’s tired of being knocked to the ground —
especially in a boys’ league that allows checking. If his parents seek your
advice about whether he should continue with lacrosse, be honest. You
may want to suggest other sports that can provide their youngster better
opportunities for fun, rewarding athletic experiences.

Chapter 9: Scoring with Offensive Fundamentals
Recognizing physical problems
Sometimes, extra factors hamper a child’s abil-
ity to learn some of the skills of lacrosse. One of
the most important reasons to hold a preseason
parents’ meeting is to find out about any chil-
dren on your team who have special needs that
you need to be aware of. (Check out Chapter 4
for more details on conducting the meeting.) Be
on the lookout for the following conditions; if
you spot them, you may be able to make a dif-
ference for the youngster.
 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD): A child’s lack of focus and ability to
comprehend instructions may be the result
of ADHD. Some common characteristics of
ADHD are distractibility, poorly sustained
attention to tasks, impaired impulse control,
and excessive activity and physical
restlessness. If you think someone on your
team is displaying signs of ADHD, talk to her
parents about your concerns.
 Vision problems: A child who continually
drops passes or has difficulty delivering the
ball to teammates may have a vision prob-
lem that can be corrected easily with
glasses or contact lenses. If you suspect a
vision problem, tell the child’s parents. 
 Hearing problems: A child who has diffi-
culty following instructions may have a
hearing problem. If a player relies on read-
ing lips, make sure that anytime you’re
explaining or demonstrating a technique
that you speak loud and clear, and look
directly at the child.

his chapter focuses on the fundamentals of good defense. Here, you find
the best ways to help your players grasp the important role of defense in
lacrosse, as well as lots of detailed information on defending opposing players.
We also cover assorted types of checks: the poke, slap, and (if you’re coaching
in a boys’ league that allows it) the much more physical body check. And we
provide a gold mine of information to help your young goalies learn their
challenging position.
Because some kids may encounter difficulties with some of these defensive
skills, we also provide handy troubleshooting tips for diagnosing what went
wrong and what to do to get the players back on track. (For some general
guidelines on the best ways to help players who aren’t catching on to skills as
quickly as most of their teammates are, head to Chapter 9.)
Stressing the Importance of Defense
Because your players will spend roughly half of each game trying to prevent
the opposing team from scoring goals, the better they understand fundamen-
tal defensive techniques, the more success they’ll have. Playing good team
defense — the kind that rattles opposing teams, forcing them to make bad
passes and low-quality shots — paves the way for your players to get more
enjoyment out of the game.
Teaching the basics of good defensive play doesn’t have to translate into a
miserable experience for the kids — and a frustrating one for you — as long
as you approach it the right way. Following are a few tactics you can use to
emphasize the importance of playing defense:

190
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 
 The payoff of playing good defense is more time on offense. This state-
ment usually is enough to grab kids’ attention and show them the benefits
of executing at the defensive end of the field. The better they become at
defending opposing teams and derailing attacks, the more opportunities
they’ll get to go on the attack themselves and take shots on goal.
 Playing defense has to be fun. Your job is to persuade the kids that you
are interested in helping them perform well both offensively and defen-
sively. You must be as thrilled when a player makes a nice defensive play
and creates a turnover as you are when he deposits a shot in the
opponent’s net for a goal.
 Run plenty of defensive drills. Pack your practices with a variety of
drills that emphasize defensive components. (Chapters 7 and 14 provide
some great drills that you can incorporate into your practices.) Whenever
you are running a drill that focuses on offensive skills, don’t neglect
coaching the defensive element and encouraging effort in that area, too.
If you’re coaching an older, more-advanced team, adding a competitive element
to the drills — such as who can make the most defensive stops in a 2-on-1 drill —
helps fuel interest and rev up enthusiasm levels. It also reminds your players
how important good defensive play is to you and how it affects the team’s over-
all performance.
Mastering the Basics of Defense
To thrive on defense, players should know how their footwork affects their
ability to stick with an opposing player all over the field, make an opponent’s
shot more challenging, and steal passes, among many other aspects of the
game. Read on for tips on pumping up your players’ defensive tenacity.
Grip
Players who use their sticks the right way enhance their effectiveness defen-
sively. The stick-on-stick and cross-handed techniques are the two basic ways
players can handle their sticks while playing defense.
In the stick-on-stick technique, the defender carries her stick in her right
hand when the opposing player’s stick is in her left hand (see Figure 10-1).
With the cross-handed method, the defender’s stick is in her left hand when
the opponent has her stick in her left hand, too. (See Figure 10-2.)
Stance
A defender’s top objective should be to keep himself positioned between his
team’s goal and his opponent’s stick. Here’s how he sets up:

1. He keeps his feet at least shoulder width apart, with the foot opposite
the opponent’s stick side positioned slightly back (see Figure 10-3).
2. He distributes his weight evenly and bends his knees slightly.
3. He tries to maintain about a stick length’s distance from the player
he’s covering.
4. He keeps his head up and his eyes on the defender.
He can swivel his head from side to side on occasion so that he knows
what is happening behind him, as well as rely on communication from
his teammates to alert him to any plays the opponent may be setting up.

Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

Footwork
The better your players’ footwork is when they’re defending an opponent’s
attack, the less likely they are to surrender good scoring opportunities.
Check out “Sticking with a player on the move,” later in this chapter, to gain
insight on the popular shuffling technique that players can use to cover
opponents on the move.
The real essence of team defense is lending support when it’s needed. When
a teammate gets beaten, and the opponent she was covering is a threat to attack
the goal or take a shot, her teammates nearby must recognize the situation and
slide over to provide defensive help.
Guarding a player standing still
Good defensive play doesn’t happen by coincidence or pure luck; excelling in
this area of lacrosse takes a dedicated effort on each player’s part. Your defense
will be only as strong as your weakest player. Help your players keep the
following pointers in mind when dealing with an opposing player whose feet
aren’t on the move:
 Favor his stronger side. Defenders can make it more difficult for the
attacker by slightly favoring the opponent’s stronger hand. If the attacker’s
top hand is his right hand, for example, he will pose more of a threat
running to his right, so the defensive player can dilute some of the
attacker’s effectiveness by moving slightly in that direction and forcing the
Figure 10-3:
A good
defensive
stance is a
prerequisite
for
successful
coverage.
192
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

opponent to attack from the left. If the player does decide to attack from
the right, the defender will be in great position to impede his progress.
 Be aware of what’s going on behind you. Just because the player the
defender is guarding isn’t attacking at that moment, she shouldn’t be
lulled into a sense of complacency, because the opponent may just be
waiting to set up a screen or pick play. (See Chapter 16 for more details
on defending these types of offensive maneuvers.) Communication
among teammates is crucial in counteracting these types of plays.
 Pay attention to tendencies. If the opponent the defender is guarding
always fakes to his right and cuts left from a stationary position, the
defender can make a subtle adjustment in his positioning to account for
this trait.
Sticking with a player on the move
When an attacker is moving around the field at a slow to moderate speed —
usually while she is surveying the field and determining when or where to
attack from — defenders should use shuffle steps to track her movements.
Shuffle steps are simply short lateral steps. The defenders must be careful not
to cross their feet so that they can remain near the attacker.
When the attacker’s pace picks up, defenders ditch the shuffling technique
and opt for running.
Any time a defender gets beaten by an opponent, he must try to recover as
quickly as possible. The faster he gets back into the play, the less time the
opponent has to capitalize on the advantage.
Dealing with a player taking a shot
Goalies in lacrosse have a challenging job, so they appreciate anything their
teammates can do to help them keep balls out of their net. Besides keeping
attackers as far away from the net as possible, defenders can lend a helping
hand by blocking shots. Even if a defender is unable to deny a shot, if she can
get her stick into the path of the shot and alter it, the ball has less chance of
reaching the net, and if it does, it arrives with at least much less force.
Following are the basic elements of disrupting shots:
 Good defensive positioning: By keeping the attacker in front in full view,
the defender can react more easily to shots. Any time the attacker has a
step on the defender, he has the advantage, and disrupting his shot is
more difficult.
193
Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

 Anticipation: This skill can’t be taught, but players pick it up over time
simply by being involved in a lot of games. Gradually, players begin to
recognize situations and get a feel for when opponents are setting up to
take a shot.
 Quick recovery: Instill in your players that even when they have been
beaten, they are never out of the play if they hustle. Players who recover
quickly enough can still deny an attacker’s shot if they are only a couple
steps behind him, especially if the opponent takes a big backswing on
his shot. A defender can get his stick in the path of the shot and knock
the ball to the ground.
Stealing the ball
The most obvious benefit of stealing the ball is that it takes away an opportunity
for the opposition to set up a shot on goal; it also can translate into a fast-break
opportunity by catching the opposing team off balance and out of position.
Here are a few techniques your team can use to create turnovers, which can
pay off in scoring opportunities:
 Watch the passer’s eyes. Youngsters handling the ball often lock their
eyes on the teammate to whom they want to pass. Telegraphing a pass
this way allows defenders who are paying attention to get a jump on the
pass and pick it off, or at least to bat it down with their sticks. At the
more-advanced levels of lacrosse, offensive players rely more on fakes,
looking one way while passing in another direction.
 Adjust strategies. At the advanced levels of lacrosse, employing different
strategies takes on greater importance and often has a greater impact on
games. If you recognize that a particular opponent isn’t quite as efficient
at passing or handling the ball, you can adjust your defense accordingly
and take a more-aggressive role. Conversely, if the opponent features
excellent passers and ball handlers, your team will be better off taking a
less-aggressive approach, because attempting to make a lot of steals
against a talented team is risky.
 Pick up on patterns. Sometimes, an opposing team gets into the habit of
running the same types of plays or attacking from the same part of the
field each time it gains possession of the ball. You can alert your players
to these patterns so that they can adjust accordingly. If the opponents
generally set up their attack from behind your team’s net, for example, and
the passes come predominantly from the right, recognizing this pattern
lets your players get a jump on the passes and perhaps pick some of them
off, or at least make them more difficult to execute.
194
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Whenever you pick up on an opposing team’s tendency, you want to refrain
from letting your team know about it before the team is able to capitalize on
it. If you know that a particular attacker generally throws long passes to a
player on her right, for example, you don’t want your defenders jumping into
that passing lane so early that the opponent sees the adjustment and has a
chance to deliver the ball elsewhere. You want your defenders to be patient
and allow her to release the ball; then they can get a good jump and sprint to
pick off the pass.
Correcting problems with defensive form
Defensive fundamentals are often more challenging for players than the basics
of offense (covered in Chapter 9), simply because some of the techniques are
based on reacting and adjusting to what an opponent is doing. This section
looks at a few areas of defensive play that tend to present problems for young-
sters and what you can do to help them overcome those problems:
 The player is unable to maintain defensive coverage on an opponent.
This situation happens all the time in youth lacrosse, for many reasons.
Pay close attention to your defender’s footwork, which is the root of
many defensive deficiencies. Also make sure that she isn’t crossing her
feet while shuffling from side to side; the moment a defensive player gets
her feet tangled, she gets off balance and out of position, giving the
opponent the green light to attack.
 The player loses his stick when executing stick checks. If a player has
only one hand on his stick, he’s not going to be able to generate much
force on his checks, and he runs a greater risk of losing control of the
stick, dropping it, or having it knocked away by an opponent.
 An attacker gets by the defender easily. This problem usually is easy to
correct: Analyze the spacing the defender keeps between herself and the
attacker. Ideally, you want your defender to stay about a stick length’s
away. If she’s any closer, the attacker can use cuts and spin moves
(covered in Chapter 11) to slip past her. By maintaining a distance of
about the length of a stick, the defender gives herself a little more time
to react to the opponent’s moves and deny her penetration.
Teaching Checking Techniques
Players on offense can turn to a variety of moves and techniques, and so can
the defenders who are trying to stop them. These techniques vary for girls’ and
boys’ teams, however. One of the most notable differences between boys’ and
girls’ lacrosse is that the boys’ game is much rougher and allows a lot of contact;
195
Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

the girls’ game doesn’t allow players on opposing teams to make contact. (For
other differences between boys’ and girls’ lacrosse, check out Chapter 3.)
In girls’ lacrosse, the two types of checks that are allowed are stick checks
and body checks. In the girls’ game, the term body checking refers to how the
defender positions her body in relation to the attacker. Being an effective
body checker requires recognizing the path the attacker wants to take and
then forcing her to alter her route.
A good body check forces the attacker to move in the direction of the bottom
hand on her stick.
When a defender steps into the path of an oncoming attacker, she must allow
the attacker enough time to adjust her course. If she fails to give the attacker
enough time to react, the official can call a blocking foul on the defender. If
the defender allows the attacker time to change directions, but the attacker
still runs into her, the official can call a charging foul on the attacker. (For
more on fouls, flip to Chapter 3.)
Stick checking
A stick check is simply a controlled hit against the opponent’s stick in an
effort to dislodge the ball from his stick. The key to making good contact is
using the head of the stick to make contact with the pocket of the opponent’s
stick and — if the check is effective — dislodge the ball.
Grip
During your practices, encourage players to experiment with their grips while
handling their defensive responsibilities. When a player moves her top hand
up closer to the pocket, she gets a lot more control of the stick but sacrifices
leverage and reach. Run through a bunch of different drills with your players,
encouraging them to place their hands in different positions on their sticks;
gradually, they will get a feel for what works best for them.
Stick position
Defenders want to maintain good defensive position and keep both hands on
their sticks so that they can execute stick checks as quickly and efficiently as
possible.
Footwork
There’s just no substitute for good footwork and being in proper defensive
position. Focus on giving your players a strong foundation in these skills;
then build on those skills by showing the players the checks that are covered
later in this chapter.
196
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Make sure your players know that their sticks are not weapons and should
never be used with malicious intent. Keep a close eye to ensure that the kids
keep their sticks under control at all times. Any time you spot players wielding
their sticks carelessly during a practice or game, pull them aside immediately
to make them aware of what they did wrong.
Executing a poke check
The poke check is one of the most popular stick checks, and it should be in
every defender’s bag of moves. A bonus of the poke check is that players can
use it with virtually no risk. Usually, they can maintain good position between
their goal and the opposing player because they aren’t lunging or trying to
make a big play; they’re simply jabbing their sticks at the opponent’s stick,
trying to force a turnover.
Here’s how the poke check is executed:
1. The player maintains proper defensive position by being about a stick
length from the opponent who’s handling the ball.
2. The defender makes a jabbing motion with his stick, by pulling his
stick back slightly and then moving it at the opponent, attempting to
dislodge the ball from the opponent’s stick.
He targets the ball handler’s bottom hand (see Figure 10-4). The hand on
the bottom of the stick generates the force.
3. The stick slides through his top hand, which guides the direction of
the poke check.
Figure 10-4:
The poke
check
requires a
jabbing
motion.
197
Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

Whenever a ball carrier swings his stick around in front of his body, a
defender has a perfect opportunity to use the poke check. Because the
attacker isn’t using his body to help shield his stick, the defender has a free
shot to dislodge the ball.
Executing a slap check
The slap check is another technique available to defenders. When defenders
are shadowing opponents by using the shuffle step, they can use the slap
check to try to knock the ball free. To make the slap check work for your
players, share the following techniques with them:
1. The defender holds her stick at approximately waist level, parallel to
the field (see Figure 10-5).
2. She snaps her stick across the opponent’s stick, keeping it parallel to
the field (see Figure 10-6), and follows it up with a couple more quick
taps in rapid succession.
3. She pulls her stick back toward her body after making contact.
Make sure that your players use a series of taps — executed quickly — rather
than a single motion when attempting to knock the ball free from the opponent’s
stick.
Correcting stick-checking problems
Understanding how to use the stick to their advantage when they don’t have
possession of the ball can be a little tricky for youngsters to pick up, especially
when they’re new to lacrosse. Following are a few problems that can trip
youngsters up and tips on how you can help them become more comfortable
wielding their sticks to their advantage:
 The attacker gets past the defender whenever he uses the poke check.
This problem usually occurs when the defender takes a step toward the
opponent while delivering the poke check. Moving forward puts the
defender slightly off balance and creates openings for the opponent to
burst past him. Remind your defenders to keep their feet shoulder width
apart while using the poke check; that stance cuts down on opportuni-
ties for attackers to get past them.
 The slap check isn’t effective. Many times, in their eagerness to knock
the ball free, youngsters take a big backswing with their sticks. Not only
is a wind-up unnecessary, but it also alerts the ball carrier to what is
coming, giving her extra time to react. Work with your players so that
they don’t pull the stick back more than 2 feet before bringing it toward
an opponent.
 A player has trouble controlling the stick. Have the child slide his top
hand a little farther up his stick, toward the pocket. Right away, he
should notice a difference in his control of the stick.
198
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

 A player has difficulty reaching the attacker she intends to stick-
check. Inspect the player’s footwork first, making sure that her feet are
shoulder width apart and that she’s facing the opposing player. If she’s
using proper footwork, have her slide her top hand down the stick
closer to her other hand. This technique helps her extend her reach
with her stick.
At advanced levels of play, encourage defenders to use a variety of checking
techniques so that the attackers will be kept off balance, unable to predict
which moves are coming.

Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

Body checking
Body checks are allowed only in boys’ lacrosse, and only at the more-
advanced levels of the game. Be sure to check with the director of your
league to find out whether body checking is allowed. (For more details on
what you should check on concerning your league’s rules, flip to Chapter 2.)
Grip
The player’s bottom hand grips the butt end of the stick. The end of his stick
should not be exposed. His top hand is approximately halfway up his stick.
Stance
The player maintains a strong base, with his feet about shoulder width apart.
His shoulders are square to the player he intends to check. Being square to
the target simply means that the player is facing the opponent and isn’t at an
angle, with one shoulder leaning out in front of the other.
Footwork
The defender stands on the balls of his feet — a stance that allows him to
exert more force.
Executing a body check
In delivering a body check, a defender fares best if he keeps himself under
control. Here’s how to execute this type of check:
1. The defender moves his stick to the side of his body, keeping his head
up and looking straight ahead (see Figure 10-7).
2. He lowers his shoulder, targeting the middle of the opponent’s chest.
3. With his arms in close to his body and both hands on his stick, he
plants his feet approximately shoulder width apart.
4. He drives his body into the attacker (see Figure 10-8).
Making contact in cross-checking
To help ensure that a check does what it’s intended to do, remind your players
to focus on the opponent’s mid-section when they execute a check. If they
focus on the opponent’s head, they can be thrown off balance by the
attacker’s fakes and are less likely to make solid contact.
200
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Delivering body checks to opponents above their shoulders, below their
knees, or from behind is illegal. Also, those types of checks put kids at unnec-
essary risk of injury. Always teach only proper and safe techniques. Any time
you see an illegal check delivered during your practices, be sure to go over
with the player what he did wrong so that he doesn’t carry that play over to
game day and put himself — or his opponent — in harm’s way.

Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

Correcting cross-checking problems
Following are some of the problems boys typically deal with when learning
how to deliver body checks:
 The defender misses making solid contact. Typically, this problem occurs
when the youngster is out of control, lunging at the player he’s attempting
to check. A good rule to share with your players is that if they wouldn’t be
able to take a step and land on the opponent’s shoes, they’re probably too
far away to attempt a body check. At older levels of play, as kids gain more
skills and quickness, they become comfortable delivering body checks
from a little farther away.
 The defender loses his balance easily. All good defensive play originates
with the feet. If a player’s body checks are leaving him off balance, make
sure that his feet are about shoulder width apart and that his knees are
slightly flexed on contact.
Anyone with possession of the ball has a bull’s eye on his chest in leagues
that allow checking. The same goes for any player within 5 yards of a loose
ball, who also can be body-checked legally. (For a rundown on the rules of
lacrosse and the penalties for various infractions, check out Chapter 3.)
Training in Goaltending Techniques
The goaltender position in lacrosse requires a wide range of skills that are
much different from anything else you’re teaching the rest of your players.
Goalies must be able to stop shots from all angles — and at all speeds —
using their arms, legs, stick, and glove. They also must contend with shots
that bounce in front of them or that are deflected by opposing players and
even their own teammates. Because the position is so difficult, youngsters
who play it must gain a sound grasp of the fundamentals.
Grip
The hands are as important to a goalie as a chainsaw is to a lumberjack.
Good work with the hands — especially in holding the stick — leads to good
goaltending. The goalie’s top hand should be at the throat of the stick, or at
least very near it. Her bottom hand should be approximately 12 inches down
from her top hand. Both palms face her (see Figure 10-9).
Stance
A goalie who is in the proper stance before the opponent ever gets into good
scoring position is prepared to deal with any type of shot that comes her
way. The goalie’s feet should be shoulder width apart, and her knees should
be slightly flexed. (For a refresher on the goalie’s stance, turn to Chapter 5.)
202
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Hands
Although the goalie’s stick stops the majority of the shots, her hands make
everything come together. Whenever a shot is taken, the goalie’s hands move
toward the ball; this momentum carries her body directly to the ball. She
uses her bottom hand to rotate her stick down so that the head of it faces the
ball to stop the shot.
Making stops
When the opponent has the ball out in front of the net, the goalie’s top
responsibility is to keep his body directly between the player’s stick and the
middle of his net. If he’s off center even just a step to either his left or right,
he opens up more space in the net for the shooter. At the advanced levels of
lacrosse, good attackers can exploit the smallest weaknesses, so establishing
good fundamental goalie play at the beginning levels is important. (Jump to
Chapter 12 to take a look at how goalies can play different angles.)
When the opposing team operates its attack from behind the net, and an
attacker maneuvers near the post, the goalie must keep his stick vertical so
that the pocket of the stick is above the net. This position helps prevent easy
passes to players out in front of the net. The goalie’s bottom hand should grip
the end of his stick, and his top hand should be positioned in the middle of it.
Figure 10-9:
In the
proper
goalie grip,

face inward.
203
Chapter 10: Setting Defensive Fundamentals

Although his grip doesn’t vary, he can position himself in several ways to defend:
 Middle position: The goalie turns to face the attacker (see Figure 10-10).
When the attacker is on his left, the goalie places his right foot in front of
the goal line and angles his left foot toward the opponent.
 Near post position: The goalie moves to the post nearer the attacker
(see Figure 10-11). This position prevents the attacker from being able to
beat his defender and take a shot toward the near post.
 Far post position: The goalie moves to the far post and takes a step
away from it (see Figure 10-12). His feet are angled toward the attacker.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Correcting goaltending problems
Because of the difficulty of learning the goaltending position, kids commonly
experience a variety of problems, such as these:
 Lack of mobility: The quicker and more mobile a goalie is, the more
shots she’ll be able to keep out of her net. Sometimes, goalies take a
stance that is too wide, which detracts from their mobility. Make sure
that those feet are kept shoulder width apart, and you should see
improved play from your young net minders.
 Fear of the ball: It’s certainly not uncommon for a young goalie to be
afraid of the ball; after all, getting hit by a shot stings sometimes. To help
a youngster overcome his fears, use a tennis ball during your practice
drills to get him comfortable making stops again. That change usually is
enough to help him regain his comfort level, as well as his confidence
that he can make saves. Then you can go back to the ball your program
uses to build on his progress.
 Inability to get the stick on shots: Check the positioning of the goalie’s
arms. If she keeps her elbows too close to her body, she limits her
movement.
 Difficulty stopping both low and high shots: This problem probably is
related to an improper stance. The goalie’s hands may be too far apart
on his stick, and his feet may be spread too wide (see Figure 10-13). Or
perhaps his feet are too close together, and his hands are too close together
on the stick (see Figure 10-14). In either case, he won’t be able to react
as quickly or be as effective in stopping shots.

inning face-offs, marching down the field, and scoring goals are some
of the ways in which offensive roles can be so much fun. Helping your
players become a productive unit — one that evolves into a potent offense
that applies pressure to opponents all game long — requires a thorough
understanding of some of the more advanced elements of the game.
In this chapter, we go on the attack (forgive us; we had to say it) and dig in to
the face-off techniques players can use to gain possession of the coveted ball.
We run down techniques such as the inside roll dodge and outside pivot,
which players can take advantage of to get by defenders, and provide some
information on shooting. Here, you find details on executing long sidearm
and long underhand shots, and faking out goaltenders.
Revving Up the Offense
Regardless of what ages or levels of lacrosse players you’re coaching, adher-
ing to some key offensive principles clears the way for your team to gradually
build on skills and emerge as a more cohesive unit. As kids gain confidence
and see themselves progressing in the game, they’ll develop a deeper appre-
ciation of lacrosse. Ideally, they’ll be a little tougher for the opposition to
defend along the way, too.

208
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 
Attacking one-on-one
Lacrosse is a team sport, but players still have room to use their individual
skills. Following are some tips to help your players attack defenders successfully
(while sticking to your team concept):
 Take advantage of tired bodies. Out-of-breath defenders aren’t going to
have the energy to keep up with an offensive player who has some
bounce in his step. When your players see that they have a tired
defender in front of them, encourage them to raise their aggressiveness
a notch, because chances are good that they’ll be able to get by that
defender.
 Maximize the mismatches. During a game, mismatches occur, such as a
small player defending a bigger, stronger opponent. But if your players
don’t recognize an advantage when it unfolds, it goes to waste, and the
defense is let off the hook. Help your players become aware of situations
that develop on the field. The better your players are at seeing and
capitalizing on mismatches, the more punch your offense will have.
 Be unpredictable. Being predictable is boring, and in lacrosse, pre-
dictability on offense makes players stagnant and less effective.
 Force defenders to react. Effective offensive players force defenders to
react to their moves. A player who uses fakes to get a defender’s feet
moving has a greater chance of luring that defender out of position.
 Play with confidence. No matter a defender’s size, speed, or strength,
instill confidence in your players so that they continue playing hard and
attacking. Just because a defender possesses some strong qualities
doesn’t mean that your players can’t be successful with different moves.
 Move in all directions. Players who are comfortable moving to both
their left and right are doubly difficult for defenders to get a read on.
During practices, make sure that your players don’t get into the habit of
always attacking on the side that’s most comfortable for them. 
 Keep moving. Players who stand still are easy for defenders to track.
Being on the move challenges opposing players to keep up. Also, defenders
who are forced to run all game long eventually show signs of tiring, leading
to additional opportunities for your players to attack.
Changing directions
The better your players become at changing directions, the more difficult they
are to defend. Teach your players how to use fakes — both inside and outside
moves — and they’ll be freer to make passes and take shots (and maybe score
more goals). Here are some tips for making the inside and outside cuts work.

Inside cut
This technique, also known as a split dodge or face dodge, is popular because
it puts the ball carrier in the middle of the field — the prime position from
which to attack the defense by shooting or passing. The key to making it work
is getting the defensive player off balance. If the defender is leaning to the out-
side or backpedaling, he has less chance to stay with (or, in boys’ lacrosse, to
check) the offensive player. Check out these steps for making an inside cut:
1. The ball carrier holds his stick close to his body.
2. He steps with his right foot, planting it outside the defender’s left foot.
A right-hander turns his left shoulder toward the defender to fake that
he is moving to the outside (see Figure 11-1).
3. He pushes off hard with his plant foot and takes a large step toward
the middle of the field with his opposite foot.
4. He dips his right shoulder and turns his body sideways (see Figure
11-2). This move helps shield the ball from the defender.
5. He takes another step with his right foot as he continues angling
toward the middle of the field.

Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

Outside cut
Defenders are naturally most concerned with keeping players out of the
middle of the field, so the outside cut is a good option to have in the offen-
sive repertoire for attacking that area of the field. The move works this way:
1. Keeping her stick near her body, the ball carrier plants her left foot
outside the defender’s right foot.
This move gives the defender the indication that she plans to attack the
middle of the field.
2. She pushes off hard with her left foot and takes a step with her right
foot to the outside of the defender (see Figure 11-3).
3. As she cuts outside (see Figure 11-4), she turns her left shoulder to
shield the defender.
4. Holding the shaft near the head of the stick, she moves her stick
across her body with her right arm (see Figure 11-5) and uses her left
arm to fend off the defensive player.
5. As she steps past the defender, she puts both hands on her stick.

Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

Mixing up the pace
The most dangerous attackers are those who have a variety of moves and
can execute them at different speeds. Even if an attacker is a fast runner, if he
moves at that same speed every time he has possession of the ball, defend-
ers pick up on that habit and have a better chance of sticking with him.
The element of surprise is an effective offensive tool for keeping defenders off
balance, and is an effective technique to employ at the older and more
advanced age groups. When you mix up the speeds at which your players
maneuver on the field — from full-out sprints to jogging, along with intermit-
tent bursts — defenders will never fully know what to expect, which
increases the chance that your players’ attack will be successful.
Perfecting the roll dodge
Many times during the course of a game, ball carriers find themselves with
their backs to the defender. Being able to pivot in either direction is impor-
tant for getting by a defender and for creating opportunities for the whole
team. The inside and outside pivots should be in every attacker’s bag. Here’s
how these moves are performed.
Inside roll dodge
Good footwork is essential for executing this move:
1. If the ball carrier is a left-handed shooter, he plants his left foot in the
middle of the defender’s feet (see Figure 11-6).
Figure 11-6:

footwork is
key for

2. He spins his back into the defender and rotates his right foot around
so that his back is to the defender. His feet are slightly beyond shoulder
width apart.
3. Holding his stick vertically and close to his head, he leans back into
the defender while looking over his right shoulder (see Figure 11-7).
4. With his left foot, he takes a strong step toward the inside of the field,
keeping his stick to the outside and using his body to shield the
defender (see Figure 11-8).
5. He slides his top hand down on his stick so that he is in good shooting
position.

Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

Outside pivot
Defenders are mostly concerned about protecting the middle of the field, so
your players can use this pivot move to gain an advantage on the outside:
1. The ball carrier plants her right foot between the defender’s feet (see
Figure 11-9).
2. She turns her body sideways, holding her stick vertically toward her
left shoulder to help shield the defender.
3. She spins her left shoulder toward the outside of the field.
4. She moves her left foot outside the defender’s left foot (Figure 11-10).
5. She slides her right hand about midway up the stick while taking her left
hand off the stick. This move helps protect the ball from the defender.

6. She moves her left elbow onto the defender’s back. This move gives
her leverage to get past the defender.
7. As she moves past the defender, she brings her stick to the front of
her body to protect it so the ball isn’t knocked loose.
Beating a defender
In boys’ lacrosse, defensive players rely heavily on checking to slow an
attacking player, bump him off his intended path, or create a turnover. Kids
who can absorb a hit and continue on their way pose a lot of problems for
defenders. Teach your players these techniques for dealing with contact, and
opponents’ checks won’t be nearly as successful in disrupting your attack:
1. As the defender comes closer, the ball carrier turns his body side-
ways. This move helps shield his stick from the defender and gives
the defender a smaller target to check.
2. The ball carrier chokes up on his stick.
Choking up (check out Chapter 3 for terms of the game) means sliding his
top hand closer to the head of the stick, which gives him more control.
3. He moves his stick into a vertical position. This maneuver makes it
easier to maintain control of the ball when the defender makes contact.
4. He leans in to the check.
Leaning in, rather than waiting for the defender to initiate contact, helps
him maintain balance. As contact occurs, the ball carrier’s weight
should be evenly distributed on both feet, which should be shoulder
width apart.
5. He absorbs the check, maintains his balance, and moves past the
defender.
As he moves by, he keeps his stick in the vertical position so that he can
maintain possession of the ball until he’s ready to pass or shoot.
Even though checking isn’t allowed in girls’ lacrosse (visit Chapter 3 for a run
down of the rules of the game and the differences between boys’ and girls’
lacrosse) players can still rely on similar moves to create openings when
their team is on the attack. If you’re coaching a girls’ team, you can teach any
of the moves described here to avoid checks in the boys’ game for your play-
ers to turn to to get past opposing defenders.
The more offensive moves your girls use, the harder they’ll be to stop, and the
more chances they’ll have to create goal-scoring opportunities.
215
Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

Shoring Up Shooting Skills
The more good jokes a stand-up comedian has at his disposal, the funnier
he’s going to be. The same principles apply to offensive players: The more
shots they have in their arsenal, the more success they have in scoring. To
help your players upgrade their shooting skills, work on the following shots.
Mastering straight shots
Determining the right time to take shots — in the heat of the action, with
defenders breathing down your players’ neck — has a big impact on a team’s
offensive productivity. Ingrain the following tips in your players’ minds to
help them deposit more shots in the opponent’s net:
 Be ready. Players must be ready to shoot at all times, because they
never know when openings will appear (and close down a second later).
Taking advantage of openings the moment they appear translates into
better scoring opportunities and usually more goals, too.
 Don’t get greedy. A lot of times when a player maneuvers past a defender,
she’s in prime position to shoot or pass the ball to a teammate, but
instead, she tries to beat another defender to get even closer to the net.
Usually, this move results in a couple of defenders converging on her, and
she ends up wasting the advantage she created seconds earlier. Remind
your players that they don’t have to be right on top of the goalie to be in
scoring position.
 Know the goalie. Most shots on goal aren’t deflected, so players can’t
count on their teammates to steer their shots into the goal for them.
Instead, they must rely on making accurate shots on net themselves.
Knowing the goalie’s tendencies — a habit of leaning toward his left on
straight-in shots, for example — can enhance your players’ effectiveness
with their shots.
 Use a quick release. The faster players shoot the ball when it’s in their
possession, the less chance the goalie has of setting up to make the save.
Zeroing in on long shots
Teams that can score goals from long distances are difficult and frustrating to
play against. Scoring goals without having to string together several accurate
passes to get close to the net can smother an opponent’s morale. A couple of
216
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

long-range shots that you can introduce to your players are the sidearm and
underhand shots. (Check out Chapter 9 for the rundown on executing the
overhand long shot and the long bounce shot.)
Long sidearm shot
This shot gives the goalie trouble judging where the ball is headed, because
the shooter uses a whip action upon release. Here’s how the shot works:
1. The ball carrier places his feet shoulder width apart, with his left
shoulder (if he’s a right-handed shooter) facing the goalie and his
hands together at the end of his stick.
2. His right hand is about halfway up the shaft, with his left hand at the
bottom. He brings his stick back at waist level so that the head of the
stick is past his right shoulder.
3. He takes the stick backward around his waist while stepping forward
toward the goalie with his left foot (see Figure 11-11).
4. He follows through by bringing the stick around his waist and shifting
his weight to his left foot, helping generate power.
Long underhand shot
The ability to execute this type of shot gives players the opportunity to shoot
the ball low to the ground or up high. Here’s how to make this shot:
1. The ball carrier places her feet shoulder width apart, with her left
shoulder (if she’s a right-handed shooter) facing the goalie.
2. She slides her right hand up by her left hand at the end of her stick.
Figure 11-11:

and hard for

217
Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

3. She brings the stick back about waist high while watching the net.
4. She rotates her hips toward the goalie while stepping forward with
her left foot. As her weight shifts forward, she brings her stick around
just above the ground. (See Figure 11-12.)
5. As the stick crosses in front of her feet, she rotates her wrists toward
the goal to release the shot and follows through above her waist.
Finding the net with in-close shots
Scoring from long range requires a strong shot. But the closer your players
are to the net, the greater role accuracy plays in whether they score. When a
shooter moves in close on a goalie, he can attempt a shot or go with a stick
fake to get the goalie to lunge out of position and create a gap to shoot at.
Here are tips for when your players are in the shadow of the opponent’s goal:
 Quicker moves are better moves. When a player is in scoring range, he
doesn’t have time to get too fancy with the fakes or the footwork.
Usually, he’s about to get checked by a defender, so the faster he
releases the ball, the better chance he has of collecting a goal.
 Keep the stick close to the body. When they’re playing in close, your
players should hold their sticks close to their bodies so that they don’t
surrender possession of the ball to defenders, who are usually nearby.
Figure 11-12:

218
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

 Forgo fakes. At the advanced levels of lacrosse, many goalies expect the
attacker’s first move to be a fake, so encourage your players to just shoot
the ball sometimes instead of trying to get the goalie out of position.
 Focus on the side opposite the head of the goalie’s stick. This is also
called the off-side. Shooting at the goalie’s off-side hip high is good
because it forces her to move to block the ball with her body or rotate
the head of her stick to the other side of her body to make a stick save.
Faking shots
Proficiency with fake shots — in which players attempt to convince the
goalie that they are shooting the ball in a specific direction when they really
intend to shoot it elsewhere — can increase your team’s goal-scoring profi-
ciency. Here’s a glance at a standard fake:
1. The ball carrier raises his stick above shoulder level and focuses on a
spot over the goalie’s right shoulder (see Figure 11-13). If the goalie is
left-handed simply reverse the directions.
2. As the goalie leans in the direction of the fake, the ball carrier lowers
his stick to waist level and steps to his right (see Figure 11-14).
3. He releases the shot.
Shooting the ball in one motion is important. Otherwise, the goalie has a
chance to recover and get back into position.

Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

Focusing on Face-Offs
A team’s ability to win face-offs can change a game’s outcome. Controlling
face-offs leads to coveted ball possession and, through effective passing and
one-on-one moves, often some good scoring opportunities too. Cashing in on
opportunities, of course, requires strong shooting skills. Every face-off your
team wins is one less possession for the opposition. If the other team doesn’t
have the ball, it can’t score, and you just can’t beat that for good defense!
When one of your players goes through a game in which she didn’t fare well
winning face-offs, chat with her about it at your next practice. Encourage her
to analyze what the other player did that worked so well against her to help
her identify some techniques that she can use herself.
Going with the up and over
Quick reflexes are real assets for winning face-offs, and players rely heavily
on speed to execute the up-and-over technique. Here’s how it works:
1. On the referee’s whistle, the player moves his stick over the ball —
the faster, the better (see Figure 11-15). His goal is to get his stick
between the opponent’s stick and the ball.
2. When he achieves that goal, he rakes the ball back to a teammate,
using the pocket on his stick.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Executing the flip
This technique relies on several elements — such as trapping the ball, fend-
ing off the opponent’s stick, and drawing the ball back. Here’s how it works:
1. On the referee’s whistle, the player flips the back of her stick down on
the ball by rotating her top wrist backward (see Figure 11-16).
2. She positions the top of the stick flat to the field and rotates her wrist
so that as she traps the ball, she rakes it backward.
Running set plays
One of the most fascinating aspects of coaching lacrosse is that when young-
sters have a fairly good grasp of the basics of the game, you can begin intro-
ducing strategies and plays for them to use on game day. Following are a few
set plays that you can run off face-offs:

Chapter 11: Playing Lacrosse Offense

 Send the ball to the goalie. One of the most basic plays you can run is
having the center midfielder send the ball directly back to the goalie.
 Pushing the ball past the opposing center midfielder. Your face-off man
focuses on knocking the ball past his opponent. A teammate rushes
forward to scoop up the ball and move the attack downfield.
 Drawing the ball backward toward a teammate. The center midfielder
rakes the ball back toward a teammate. It’s important that the players
not involved in the face-off are ready to pick up a loose ball and don’t
allow nearby players from the opposing team to gain possession.

W
atching your team push the ball down the field and score goals is
rewarding for you and great fun for the kids, but you’ll quickly realize
that derailing an opposing team’s attack and denying it the chance to do the
same to you is equally satisfying. Showing your players how to transition
from offense to defense, as well as how to handle their responsibilities when
the opposition has the ball, has a big impact on their game-day performance
and how much enjoyment they get out of participating in lacrosse.
In this chapter, we dig in to some key defensive elements that your players
need to be well versed in, because they spend roughly half of every game on
defense. We cover the different defensive styles your team can use and dis-
cuss many techniques that help comprise a sound defensive unit, ranging
from defending cuts to (in some boys’ leagues) picking up checks.
Also, because the goaltending position is so prominent in lacrosse, and because
it’s difficult to play well because of all the skills and nuances involved, we devote
a large section (“Making Saves”) to facing all sorts of shots.
Determining the Defense
When you choose the type of defense you want to play, you can go with either
player-to-player or zone defense. The most commonly used defensive style is
player-to-player, which is exactly what it sounds like: Each player is responsible
for defending a specific player on the opposing team.
At the more-advanced levels of play, when kids have more experience with
the game, you can introduce the zone defense. This style of defense is more

224
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 
complex and tougher to teach than player-to-player, because players are
responsible for defending an area of the field rather than an individual. The
following sections look at both defense styles.
Player-to-player
Player-to-player defense is the better type to use when you’re coaching
beginning lacrosse players. In this defensive approach, your defender covers
the opposing player wherever he goes on the field.
A general rule to keep in mind: The closer an opposing player is to your goal,
the closer your defender should be to her. When an opponent is 40 yards
from the goal and doesn’t have possession of the ball, your player doesn’t
need to be right on top of her.
You can make all sorts of modifications in player-to-player defense to fit the
strengths of your team. You can choose an aggressive approach that applies
more pressure to the opponent but also involves more risk, for example. This
high-pressure type of play works well with quick-footed players who under-
stand the game well enough to be able to slide over and help teammates who
need defensive support. If your team’s defensive skills are still in the develop-
mental stages, you may prefer a less-aggressive style that doesn’t expose
your team’s weaknesses as much, even though it allows the opposition to dic-
tate much of the action by controlling the ball a little more easily.
Here are some additional coaching tips to keep in mind:
 Communicate constantly. Good communication skills are important in
relationships, in the workplace, and when your team is defending an
attack. Whenever a player manages to knock the ball away from an
opponent and onto the ground, for example, he needs to yell “Ball!” to
alert nearby teammates who might be able to make a play.
Communication also plays a vital role when a defender gets beaten. In
such a situation, yelling “Help!” lets the teammate nearest her know that
she needs to provide defensive coverage so that the opponent can’t
roam free and take an uncontested shot.
 Keep the head moving. The best defensive players know what’s going
on all over the field, because they always know where the player they
are guarding is, as well as the location of the ball.
 Always be ready to help. Lacrosse is a team game, so players must
always be ready and able to help a teammate who has been beaten.
Defenders can’t be concerned just with the players they are guarding;
they must also keep an eye on the other opponents and be ready to
assist teammates whenever necessary.

 Keep the sticks in the air. Players can defend a lot more territory by
keeping their sticks in the passing lanes, thereby limiting the space the
offense has to operate in. When defenders hold their sticks close to their
bodies, opponents can exploit that situation, because they have more space
in which to work the ball around to create a good scoring opportunity.
 Play on the appropriate side of the opponent. When the opponent your
player is defending doesn’t have the ball, your defender should always play
slightly to the side of him that coincides with the side of the field the ball is
on. This maneuver allows the defender to gain a step if the opponent cuts
toward the ball to receive a pass. If the opponent cuts away from the ball,
any pass in his direction must go over the defender’s head, which puts him
in an advantageous position to intercept the ball or deflect it.
 Cover quickly. Whenever a pass is on the way to a player your defender
is covering, she should step out to cover her opponent while the ball is
in midair. This way, she’s in position to defend as soon as the opponent
gets possession. If she waits until the reception has been made to move
forward, the opponent has more time to get settled and plan her move.
 Be a constant distraction. Whenever an opposing player has the ball,
the defender responsible for covering him should be a constant source
of aggravation.
In a boys’ league that allows checking, the defender should use the stick
check (see Chapter 10 for more details on executing stick checks), as
well as keep his stick around shoulder height to cut down on passing
lanes and make it more difficult for the opposing player to scan the
entire field.
 Don’t be afraid of the ball. Sometimes, for fear of being hit by the ball,
youngsters turn their backs when an opposing player winds up to take a
shot. This move is one of the worst mistakes a defender can make. By
turning her back, she’ll be taking herself out of position if the opponent
is faking a shot, which will create an opportunity for that player to move
past the defender and take a real shot even closer to the goal.
If some of your players have a fear of being hit, first use tennis balls in
your drills to help get them comfortable facing shots; then work your
way up to a regulation lacrosse ball. You may even want to consider
using a tennis ball in some of your early-season practices to help the
kids become comfortable before making the transition to the harder
lacrosse ball.
 Watch out for penalties. Sure, penalties occur during games, but the key
is keeping them to a minimum. Don’t ignore penalties when they occur
during your practice drills. Kids must understand what they did wrong
so that those habits don’t carry over to game day and put your team at a
disadvantage.
225
Chapter 12: Playing Lacrosse Defense

Zone
You can use many styles of zone defense, based on what type of offense the
opponent is running. The basic concept for any zone is that each player is
responsible for a specific area of the field; whenever an opposing player
enters that zone, the defender provides coverage. Whenever your team com-
mits a penalty and must play a person short, a zone defense works well to
compensate, because you are unable to put a defender on every opposing
player.
A basic zone defense that you can use when your team is down a player is
the 2-1-2 zone (see Figure 12-1). Two midfielders play at the top of the zone,
farthest away from the goal, while three defenders surround the crease area.
The players’ primary focus is preventing inside shots, so whenever the ball is
on the opposite side of their coverage area, they sag down to help deny
inside penetration.
When one of your players makes a great defensive play, recognize the effort
with a verbal comment during the game or a high five when he comes to the
sidelines for a breather. Kids will understand the importance of defense —
and give you a strong effort in that area of the game — when they sense that
you place as much importance on it as you do on their play at the offensive
end of the field.

Polishing Individual Techniques
Playing good team defense — the kind that smothers goal-scoring opportuni-
ties, keeps opponents off balance, and makes trying to work the ball down
the field a frustrating experience — requires each player to understand and
be able to use a variety of techniques. In the following sections, we look at
some defensive skills that your players can use.
Picking up checks
If you’re coaching in a boys’ league that permits checking, your players will
enjoy the defensive side of the game more, and have more success, if they
understand how and when to check players (see Chapter 10 for techniques).
When you instruct your players on the role of checking in defense, emphasize
these benefits:
 It gives the opponent something else to think about. A check doesn’t have
to knock a player to the ground or produce a turnover to be effective. The
more checks your players deliver during the course of a game, the more
the other team will think about those checks. When opponents know that
they are going to get hit as soon as they catch a pass or try to move into
shooting range, they’ll start making adjustments by turning their bodies or
making other moves to avoid some of the contact. Forcing opponents to
perform these extra maneuvers takes away some of their effectiveness,
because they’re not able to attack quite as quickly as normal.
 It cuts off the middle of the field. Whenever an opponent drives toward
the middle of the field, the defender must keep his body on the opponent
and deliver a stick check to prevent him from taking a shot or passing to
a teammate.
Closing out
A close out occurs when a defender is in such a position that she must charge
toward the opponent who has the ball. This situation usually occurs in a
cross-field pass when the defender has to get out on the player who’s receiving
the ball; otherwise, that player will be open to take a shot on net. In this situa-
tion, she must get her body in front of the player’s stick while maintaining
balance. If she is out of control as she runs toward the opponent, her momentum
will take her out of position, as well as out of the play. If he fails to arrive on
time, he should focus on the player’s stick, and as it’s being set up to take a
shot, he should use his stick to knock the opponent’s stick up or down to
disrupt the shot.

Chapter 12: Playing Lacrosse Defense

Recovering when beaten
One strength of a really good defense is the players’ commitment to hustling
every second they are on the field and refusing to allow any easy scoring
opportunities for the opposition. To achieve this type of play all season long,
you must instill in your players the competitive desire to work themselves
back into the play whenever they have been beaten and have lost contact
with the player they are defending.
Just because an opponent gets by one of your defenders doesn’t mean that she
should give up and become a spectator, simply watching the action unfold. She
must devote all her energy to chasing that player down, because she doesn’t
know what could happen. If she hustles back fast enough, she may be able to
make a play on the opponent or at least distract him enough with a stick check
where he can’t get off a clear shot or pass. Remember, in girls lacrosse some
leagues, at the more advanced levels of play, allow stick checking. Oftentimes,
a modified form is allowed where the defender can check the stick if it is below
shoulder level and as long as the defensive motion is downward and away from
the opponent’s body. Or maybe a teammate slid over to cover the opponent,
and she can cover the player her teammate left unguarded to help minimize
the chance that a quality scoring chance will develop.
Defending cuts
Whenever possible, you want your defensive players to force opponents to
run toward the sideline, rather than toward your goal. When a player cuts to
the middle of the field, he poses more of a threat to the defense than he does
if he is on the outside.
To steer opponents to the outside of the field, a defender does the following:
1. He positions himself in front of the offensive player with his inside
foot about 6 inches in front of his outside foot.
2. When the opponent cuts to the outside, the defender pushes off with
his front foot and takes a step backward with his back foot in the
direction of the attacker (see Figure 12-2).
3. He keeps his stick at about waist level parallel to the ground.
This stance allows him to check the opponent, too, to keep him off bal-
ance and keep him from going where he wants to.
228
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Opponents who cut inside pose threats to the defense, because they are
attacking a valuable piece of real estate that must be protected. When a
player cuts to the inside, the defender counters with the following moves:
1. She steps backward with her inside foot and shuffles both feet later-
ally in the direction in which the opponent is moving (see Figure
12-3), taking short, quick steps.
2. She keeps her feet spread about shoulder width apart to maintain a
solid base.
This stance is important if he uses a check so that he keeps his balance.
3. She holds her stick at about waist level parallel to the ground so that
she can disrupt shots and deny passing lanes.

Chapter 12: Playing Lacrosse Defense

Positioning in the midfield
As soon as your team surrenders possession of the ball, whether due to a
turnover or a shot on goal, every player must commit to playing strong defense.
Many defensive breakdowns occur in the midfield area, which can lead to good
scoring opportunities for the opposition. One of the most important elements of
strong defensive play in the midfield area is having each player mark the player
he is defending goal side — that is, keeping himself between the opponent and
the goal.
When an opposing player has possession of the ball in the midfield area, the
defender should focus on forcing her to her weak side. That means forcing a
right-handed player to move to her left, and vice versa (see Figure 12-4).
While shadowing the opponent, the defender holds her stick up in front of
her. Her nondominant hand is at the bottom of the stick, and her dominant
hand grips near the middle of the stick. She stretches her arms out to harass
the opponent and to contest passes and shots.
Making Saves
Playing the goaltender position in lacrosse is more challenging than working
a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded — at least, it can seem that way some days. The
position requires a broad range of skills, many of which take years of practice
before the goalie becomes proficient.
In this section, we help you begin to build your goalies’ skills, covering every-
thing from playing the angles and defending corner shots to stopping long
and in-close shots.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Relying on reflexes
At the beginning levels of lacrosse, many young goaltenders are more inter-
ested in swatting the butterfly floating around the net than in stopping the
ball heading their way, so expecting them to have the reflexes to react to
shots isn’t reasonable. But at the more-advanced levels of play, goalies must
rely on their reflexes to turn away shots and deny goals to the opposition.
One of the best ways to build quick reflexes in your goalies is to use drills that
force them to react to a flurry of shots in a short period. This technique helps
build their hand–eye coordination and also helps them learn to anticipate
where shots are headed as soon as they are released from a player’s stick.
(Check out Chapter 7 for some basic drills to use with your goaltenders.)
Good reflexes and being in the right position based on the angle of the oppo-
nent’s shot are an effective combo for keeping balls out of the net. Read on to
get the scoop.
Playing the angles
If you remember your days in geometry class, you learned a lot about angles
(if you were paying attention and not flirting with a cute classmate, that is).
Being an effective goalie requires understanding the angles of shots and
where to be positioned in the net to defend them the best.
Here are a few additional coaching points to make regarding playing the angles:
 Understanding angles saves a lot of work. When a goalie is in the proper
position based on the angle of the shot, he saves himself a lot of work,
because he doesn’t have to lunge or stretch to make quite as many 
saves. Because of his good positioning, many shots simply bounce off him.
 Remain centered. Playing the right angles requires starting from the
center of the net before moving out on shooters. Remind goaltenders to
watch their positioning as the play develops to ensure that they are
between the goal posts and that they haven’t strayed a step in either
direction. This technique helps them take the proper angle as they step
out to challenge a shooter.
 Keep the post within reach. You don’t want the goalie straying so far
out of the crease that she would have great difficulty recovering from a
pass to a player around the front of the net area. A general guideline is
that the goalie should be able to touch the short-side post — the one
closer to her — with her glove-hand arm extended.
231
Chapter 12: Playing Lacrosse Defense

 Experiment during practices. During your drills, encourage goalies to
test how far out of the net they are comfortable moving to challenge
shooters. This experiment will give them a good gauge of what will work
best for them on game day. Goalies who possess a lot of quickness may
find that they can take two steps out from the net and still be able to
cover it efficiently; others may find that one step out puts them in the
best position to stop shots.
Your goaltenders must keep in mind that the deeper they play in the net, the
more openings they provide for the shooter. When they move out of the net
to challenge shooters, they cut down on the angle and provide a much
smaller target for the opponent to shoot at.
Defending the corner shots
The goalie position requires constant movement — both side to side and up
and back — when the opposition is on the attack. If a right-handed goalie
(who holds the stick in his right hand) sees the ball go into the right corner,
he slides his body in that direction and puts his outside foot against the goal
post, with his leg pressed tightly against the post (see Figure 12-5). His arm
holding the stick rests against the outside of the post, while the stick is
between his legs. His head is upright and facing the player in the corner,
though he should be constantly scanning what is taking place in front of him
so that he’s ready to slide over in case a pass is made to a player in that area.

Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

Stopping breakaway shots
When a goaltender faces a breakaway shot — one made by an offensive
player who has a clear path to the goal with no defender nearby — her first
reaction may be to say a quick prayer, because these shots are the toughest
ones to stop. The advantage is tipped heavily in the shooter’s favor. But your
goalie has a couple of options:
 Move out. She can take a few steps out of the net, which takes a longer
shot away from the opponent and forces her to move in closer before
releasing the ball. Moving out also cuts down on the angles the shooter
has available.
 Focus on fakes. Many shooters, as they close in on the net, go with a
fake before taking a shot. Your goalie can play a hunch and not bite on
the opponent’s first move. This option works if the opponent did indeed
fake the shot; it fails miserably when the opponent has no intention of
faking and releases the ball into the net.
Maintaining positioning when 
the ball is behind the net
Many lacrosse teams’ offensive plays originate from behind the net, so your
goalie must be prepared to defend when the ball moves back there. Depending
on the size of your goalie and the size of the net used in your program, this is
the ideal position for him to be in:
1. His right foot is pressed against the inside of the right post while his
left hand (his glove hand) stretches toward the left post (see Figure 12-6).
For left-handed goalies, do the opposite.
2. He keeps his back tight against the crossbar.
3. He keeps the stick positioned between his legs and lets it graze the
ground.
4. He continually looks over his shoulder to monitor what the player
with the ball is doing.
5. He keeps his body facing the play in front of him so that he is ready to
make a save if the ball is passed out to the front area.
233
Chapter 12: Playing Lacrosse Defense

Holding the proper position 
during face-offs
Lacrosse features several rules that your goaltenders must know to play their
position most effectively during a face-off. (For a rundown on the basic rules of
the game, check out Chapter 3.) During a face-off, the goalie should stand with
one foot in and one foot out of her crease, or with both feet out of the crease.
Because players can’t pass the ball into their own crease, the goalie must be
outside it in case a teammate needs to pass the ball back to her. She also must
keep one foot in the crease in case she wants to draw a loose ball back.
Your goalies should keep in mind that if they go after a loose ball and leave
their crease, they cannot return to the crease with it.
Stopping long shots
Players don’t have to be right on top of a goalie to present a scoring threat;
an opponent can be 20 yards from the goal and still score. Long shots can
present problems for goalies because those shots typically are difficult to
track, what with a maze of players moving between the shooter and the net.
Also, when the opposing player has a strong shot, the ball can travel from his
stick to the goal in what seems to the goalie to be the blink of an eye.

positioning

234
Part III: Basic Training: Teaching Lacrosse Skills 

When you’re coaching your goalies to stop long shots, emphasize the following
points:
 Step out. The goalie should take one step forward toward the shooter.
This move cuts down on the available space the opponent has to shoot at.
 Move in an arc. As the ball goes around the field, the goalie follows it by
moving in an arc. If the ball is on the goalie’s left, for example, and it has
been passed to the right side of the field, the goalie takes one step off
the left goal post, slides with a shuffle step to the middle of the net, and
then takes a step back to the right goal post. While performing these
steps, she maintains her ready stance and keeps her body facing the ball
at all times.
Denying in-close shots
In-close shots are as problematic for goalies as kryptonite is for Superman.
Whenever an opponent works the ball in close for a shot, the odds are in his
favor, but that doesn’t mean all hope is lost. If you show your goalies the proper
techniques for contending with these shots — and showing them how to use
their arms, legs, and stick to keep the ball out of the net — they can send
opponents back down the field shaking their heads about how they weren’t
able to register a goal.
The most important point to keep in mind is that the goalie should stay a
little closer to the net than he does when dealing with a long shot. If he steps
out too far, the shooter may have a chance to put the ball over his shoulder
for a goal.
Dealing with bounce shots
Sometimes, players’ shots bounce short of the net — often because of an
intentional act by the shooter — and these shots can pose new challenges for
goalies. The secret to turning bouncing shots away is attacking the ball the
way a hungry dog does a meaty bone. Work with your goalie to step forward
and get her body in front of the ball as soon as she recognizes that the ball is
going to bounce short of the net. You want her to have her stick out in front
of her as the first line of defense. Then, if she misses the ball with her stick,
she can rely on her legs and chest to block it. (Check out Chapter 14 for some
drills on stopping bounce shots.)
Make sure that the goalie isn’t lunging for the ball with his stick, which is a
clear indication that his body isn’t in the proper position to make the save.

O
ne of the real trademarks of a quality lacrosse coach
is the ability to propel players to higher levels of play.
In this part, you ﬁnd everything you need to do exactly
that, such as information on adjusting to the ever-changing
dynamics of your team and upgrading your drills to match
the players’ progress. The part also provides approaches
you can use to make your offense more potent and to turn
your defense into an even tougher unit to score against.

Chapter 13
Refining Your Coaching Strategies
In This Chapter
 Making adjustments as the team evolves
 Evaluating your team at the halfway point
 Staying connected to the parents
T
he group of lacrosse players you greeted at your first practice is dramatically
different from the one you’re working with at the halfway point of the season.
After participating in a bunch of practices with you, and playing in games
under you, your team will be more efficient at executing the fundamentals of
the game. Sure, this progress is pleasing to see, but a word of caution: Don’t
hit that cruise-control button and think you can coast through the second
half of the season. You want your team to be as strong in the second half of
games as it is in the first half, and the same goes for your coaching.
In this chapter, we look at how you can adjust your coaching strategies to meet
the ever-changing demands of the season. We give you tips on handling the tricky
change in team dynamics that occurs. We also outline your key midseason
responsibilities, including revising coaching strategies, adjusting practice plans,
setting goals, and reviewing the progress of your players. If that’s not enough,
we also discuss how chats with parents can keep you in the loop on how your
players really feel about lacrosse, the season, and you. Use the information
presented in this chapter to finish the season on a positive note.
Adjusting to Changing Team Dynamics
Whether you’re coaching in a six-week beginner league or a three-month
advanced league, by the time your team reaches the halfway point of the
season you have a pretty good idea of what areas your team excels in, as well
as those aspects of the game that pose problems.
Even excellence can be a problem. Perhaps your players have greatly improved
their stick-handling and passing skills, to the point where they drive defenses
crazy with their ability to move down the field and score on a consistent basis.

240
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 
In that case, you’ve got to adjust everything from your practice planning to
your points of emphasis so you can raise the kids’ defensive skills to match
those offensive plays they’ve become so darn good at.
Regardless of what part of the game they involve, improvements and areas of
weakness affect the makeup of your team. You must shuffle players into
different positions, tweak your practice drills to account for the team’s ever-
changing skills and needs, and — if you’re coaching an advanced-level team —
probably even fiddle with some of your game-day strategies to account for
newfound strengths and compensate for any weaknesses that come to light.
In the following sections, we help you gauge your team’s overall develop-
ment, and we assist you in revising your coaching plans to focus on areas you
want to strengthen during the remainder of the season.
Never rely on the scoreboard in evaluating your team’s performance or
progress, because scores can be misleading. Even if your team lost by half a
dozen goals, your players may have turned in one of their best performances
of the season, with almost flawless execution of the fundamentals. Or perhaps
your team won by a lopsided margin, but against a much weaker opponent
and with a lot of sloppy turnovers due to poor passing technique. One of the
underlying secrets of good coaching is ignoring the final score — win or lose —
and putting the magnifying glass squarely over the kids’ performances. Ask
yourself questions centered on execution and the areas of the game you
worked on in practice earlier in the week.
Recognizing improvements
As players pick up skills, show improvement, and gain knowledge of lacrosse,
they’ll become more proficient during your practice drills, as well as on game
day when Mom and Dad are in the stands cheering them on. As a coach, you
can’t ask for much more than seeing the kids improve, progress, and enjoy
varying levels of success on the lacrosse field. Player improvement will make
you proud — and well it should, because making everything come together
takes a lot of time, effort, commitment, and patience on your part.
Although you deserve a pat on the back for a job well done up to this point,
the situation does present some new — and, we hope, exciting — challenges.
The following list gives you a peek at some of the common challenges you face
when coaching a team with improving players:
 Shifting players around on the field: After a few games and many
practices, you may realize that kids you penciled in at certain positions are
better suited to handle entirely different ones. During practices, pay close
attention to the smallest details. If you notice that one of your midfielders
transitions well to defense, for example, perhaps taking on a defensive role

would suit him better and enhance the team too. By observing players as
closely as a detective does a crime scene, you may discover that a young-
ster would be able (and eager) to play a new position that would make the
team more effective. At the very least, you can identify valuable backups if
any players have to leave a game or get injured.
Any time you shift a player to a new position, be sure to alert the parents.
Communicating regularly with parents (see Chapter 4) is important,
because any news concerning their child is big in their eyes. It also reduces
the chance of disputes. Tell the parents why you think their child is better
suited for this new position and how the skills you’ve watched her develop
in recent weeks make her a real asset to the team. Sometimes, this news
will be well received; at other times, not so well. (For more on dealing with
parent issues, flip to Chapter 18.)
 Trimming the tension: If you coach an advanced-level squad and deter-
mine playing time by skill level, you may discover that youngsters who
lose their starting jobs have great difficulty adjusting to their backup
status or new positions if you simply move them with little or no
explanation. After all, feelings get hurt when a player’s skills are
indirectly criticized in front of teammates, and many kids perceive a
move this way. Make sure you take the time to explain to the player that
he’s a valued and important member of the team. Encourage him to keep
working hard in practice and to support his teammates.
 Diffusing disappointment: A youngster who loses her spot to a teammate
is naturally disappointed, much as you would be if you lost a promotion
to a co-worker. Pay some extra attention to the child who lost her position
to ensure that she remains passionate about the game and supportive of
her teammates. Let her know that if she continues working hard, chances
are strong that she can pick up the skills that will lead to more minutes
on game day. Also, by working hard in practice and challenging her
teammates during drills, she can help them improve and have a role in
making the team a more efficient unit.
 Making changes in your game-day approach: As the season moves
along, your team may become significantly different from the one that
began the first practice — and you have to adjust accordingly. Maybe
early in the season, the kids didn’t have a good handle on the mechanics
of checking (if you’re coaching an advanced-level boys’ team) or
cradling (if you’re coaching a beginning-level girls’ team). Now, halfway
through the season, all your advice and all the players’ practice have
come together, and the team has those areas of the game down pretty
well. In that case, you should capitalize on these improved skills and
tweak your game-day strategies to take advantage of them.
241
Chapter 13: Refining Your Coaching Strategies

Keeping close tabs on each player’s progress makes it easy for you to be there
to deliver a high five whenever the kid learns a new skill or makes an improve-
ment. Maybe the action is subtle, such as the youngster’s positioning his feet
properly to take a face-off, or maybe he is becoming consistent at scooping up
balls on the run. Regardless, be sure to show plenty of enthusiasm, which is
the fuel for spurring more learning. The goal of improving should be to build
self-confidence and have more fun, which will help the players appreciate the
game more and want to stay involved for years to come.
Revising your drills
There are many great aspects associated with coaching lacrosse, and one of
the most enjoyable is revising practices and game plans to accommodate the
ever-improving skills of their players and the ever-changing needs of their
teams. Any time the kids are improving individual skills and the team is pro-
gressing as a unit, you want to embrace this special opportunity to help
propel them even further in their development. You don’t want to suffocate
learning by turning to the same set of drills at every practice. Your kids will
get the most out of their participation and improve fastest if you keep chal-
lenging them with new drills. (For some practice drills you can run to raise
the level of play a notch or two, turn to Chapter 14.)
To keep your practices fresh and imaginative, and your players motivated,
look for clever ways to tweak some of the most popular drills you’ve used in
previous practices. If you do a shooting drill in which the players simply
work on getting the ball past the goalie, try this slight alteration: Challenge
the kids to score goals in a particular area of the net. This slight alteration in
a basic drill introduces a new component that challenges the kids and grabs
their interest because it’s new and fun. Award bonus points for each goal
scored in the area of the net that players are aiming at, and turn the drill into
a fun competition to see which player fares best.
Conducting the Midseason Review
Halfway through the season, you’ll notice all sorts of changes and improve-
ments among your players. Ideally, you’ll also see that your team has really
bonded under your leadership. Don’t stand pat on your successes, however:
Take the time to review how the team is progressing.
242
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

Conducting a midseason review benefits both you and the players. It helps
keep a headache-free season headed in the right direction, and it can rescue a
season that’s drifting a little off course.
We all enjoy getting progress reports — in school, at work, and in other
endeavors — especially when we receive glowing feedback about how well
we’ve been doing. Your players are no different. Pointing out their progress
and improvement drives home the point that you have their best interests in
mind and that you’re committed to helping them get the most out of their
experience this season.
The following sections explain how you can set goals for your players and the
team; help you turn those goals into plans; and show you how you can evalu-
ate progress from this point on.
Setting coaching goals
When done the right way, setting goals is one of the most effective coaching
tools available. Goals push your players to reach their full potential by pre-
senting challenges that they can have fun striving for and meeting. At the
season’s halfway point, put the knowledge you’ve gained from watching your
players to good use by setting goals for them for the rest of the season.
Giving yourself pointers
To make midseason goal-setting successful, keep the following points in mind:
 Encourage practice. Encourage more advanced players to practice skills
with their parents or friends at home. Just a few minutes in the backyard
or park a couple of times a week can pay big dividends. Never force
practice — you don’t want to make it feel like dreaded homework — but
nudge kids in the right direction with gentle reminders about polishing
certain skills at home.
 Find a balance. Choose goals that are in between being too easy and too
difficult so that you keep the child’s interest, minimize frustration, and
maximize his chances of success.
 Be realistic. Set only goals that fit within the framework of the team.
(See “Fitting your goals to your team” later in this chapter.) Giving an
attacker a goal of scoring three goals, for example, is unrealistic. The
child has no control over individual performance numbers, such as how
many goals she can score. Plus, that type of goal kills team chemistry
because there is a chance she will look to shoot more to reach that goal,
which means she could overlook open teammates who are in a better
position to shoot.
243
Chapter 13: Refining Your Coaching Strategies

 Use short-term goals. The younger the child, the shorter the attention
span, so you’re better off setting a series of short-term goals so that the
child sees lots of progress right away. Long-term goals have a way of
evaporating in a child’s mind.
 Go with several levels. Set goals at varying levels so that if a player
doesn’t reach the top goal but makes strides toward it, she still gains a
sense of accomplishment. Having just one goal to shoot for turns goal
setting into an all-or-nothing proposition.
 Get player feedback. At the advanced levels of play you can make goal
setting more effective — and more enjoyable for the kids — if you have a
short discussion with the whole team on which areas of the game they
want to improve. Giving players a voice in the goal-setting process helps
drive their development.
 Factor in injuries. Any time a youngster has been injured during the
season and misses some playing time, be sure to take that missed time
into account when setting goals. Young players often take some time to
get back up to their preinjury levels. After you sense that a player is
back at his normal level after an injury, you can revisit his goals and
adjust them to coincide with his improved health. 
Fitting your goals to your team
Setting team goals that revolve around winning may seem like a good idea,
but those goals can lead to all sorts of problems. If one of your team goals is
to win the last three games of the season, for example, and you drop the first
of those three games, the goal is suddenly unreachable. In terms of the goal,
it doesn’t matter whether your team played really well and simply lost to a
better team or got edged out by a fluky goal in the closing seconds.
Team victory goals represent the proverbial double-edged sword. When the
team wins, the players’ confidence soars; when games don’t end in victories,
the players are blanketed in disappointment and doubt. Instead, steer team
goals away from the win–loss record. Focus on weekly improvement and on
playing hard at both ends of the field. Aim for team goals such as committing
fewer turnovers than in the last game or committing fewer penalties than the
week before. Positive team goals such as these make a real difference in help-
ing kids raise the level of their game.
If you’re coaching a beginning-level team, keep the midseason emphasis on
having fun; downplay winning and losing. When you keep the goals realistic,
you’ll realize your share of wins — and more important, you create an envi-
ronment that allows your players to reap the rewards of playing, learning,
and achieving together.
244
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

Helping your players improve their skills
Any time you’re mapping out the midseason review for your players, you
start by establishing realistic goals that they can reach by working hard and
following your lead. You want to set your players up for plenty of successes —
not failures — and create an environment in which they can flourish. After
establishing realistic goals, you act on them by creating plans to help your
players achieve those goals.
Planning for player success
Putting together a skill-building plan requires working up to the goals one
step at a time. If you build players’ confidence with each step in the progres-
sion, your players reap the benefits. To help your youngsters gauge their
progress, make sure that you compare their current performances with those
from earlier in the season. Many times, kids tie their progress to how the
team is performing, which isn’t a good indicator, because wins and losses
don’t play a role in how a player has grown and developed in different areas
of the game. Just because the team has won five games in a row doesn’t nec-
essarily mean that a child has become an accurate shooter. Conversely,
simply because the team has been on the losing end of several games
recently doesn’t mean that the youngster couldn’t be improving and playing
some of her best lacrosse of the season.
Suppose that your midfielder has become good at catching passes while
standing still or while moving just a couple of steps in either direction.
Naturally, one of your next goals for him is to catch passes while running
faster; this goal upgrades his skills and helps him become a more complete
player. The more skills a player has, the more difficult he is to defend.
Putting the plan into play
Any plan is executed on the field over time. The following sample plan is a snap-
shot of the entire process, which may unfold over the course of a few weeks:
1. Position yourself several yards away from the player, and throw the
ball several yards in either direction.
This drill forces the youngster to react quickly and make a play on the
ball. Don’t make the throws too challenging at first; you want to instill con-
fidence in the youngster before progressing to more challenging throws.
2. Gradually put the throws a little farther out of her range so that she
has to take several steps to catch them.
Getting the player to move a little out of her comfort range starts the
process of building on her existing skills.
245
Chapter 13: Refining Your Coaching Strategies

3. When she starts to catch more balls than she misses, increase the
challenge by having her jog in a set direction while you send passes
her way.
4. When the youngster is again catching the majority of your passes,
have her sprint down the field and attempt to catch your passes on
the run.
When working with youngsters on new skills, be patient. Build their confi-
dence in performing a fundamental skill; then slowly add more complex com-
ponents one at a time. In most cases, you’re not going to see huge
improvements during the span of a one-hour practice. Over several sessions,
though, you’ll see positive strides, and you’ll be sending more-complete play-
ers onto the field on game day.
Exploring different approaches for reaching goals
You can help kids reach their goals in many ways; you just have to find what
works best for each player. Some kids require more motivation than others.
Some need more feedback and interaction from you. Others require an
entirely different approach.
During your practices, pay close attention to the looks on the kids’ faces and
the way they move on the field. Do the players look excited to participate,
and are they moving enthusiastically through the drills? Or is their face all
wrinkled up in frustration, and are they lacking spring in their steps? If you’re
not seeing the reactions you hope for, take a closer look at your drills.
Perhaps the drills are too difficult or aren’t tailored to the skills you want to
focus on. Figure out ways to inject more fun into the drills.
Evaluating the tempo of your practices is important, too. Fast-moving practices
that feature little standing-around time tend to be well received by the players,
because they simply don’t have a chance to be bored and relegated to spectator
status.
Moving players to new positions
A lot of times, a child becomes disenchanted with lacrosse because he’s not
playing the position he had his heart set on when he signed up. You can imag-
ine the heartbreak a child endures if he wanted to experience the thrill of
scoring a goal but was stuck on defense at the first practice of the season and
hasn’t moved since. Sometimes, sliding a player into a new position is all it
takes to rekindle his interest. The change of scenery on the field could do
wonders for his enthusiasm, and you may just find that the change pays divi-
dends for the team as a whole.
246
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

If you’re coaching a beginning-level team, you should already be moving the
kids around a bit so that they get a chance to experience as many positions
as possible. If you’re coaching an advanced-level team, it never hurts to
tinker with your lineup, not only to keep the players fresh and challenged,
but also to evaluate whether different combinations on the field give the team
a more potent offense or a more difficult defense to score against.
Keeping Parents in the Game
When it comes to smart coaching moves, keeping parents in the loop all season
long deserves a spot near the top of the list. (Chapter 4 covers the importance
of conducting a preseason parents’ meeting to open the lines of communication.)
Setting aside time to talk to parents individually to find out how their child is
enjoying the season so far not only shows how much you care, but also is a
great way to get the scoop on the impact you’re having. These one-on-one chats
can be especially comforting to parents who are new to the sport of lacrosse
and are unsure how to gauge how their child is performing.
Near the halfway point of the season, notify the parents that you want to set
aside a few moments the following week to speak to them individually about
their kids and get their input on how the season has gone so far. Making this
announcement after a game works well because most youngsters have parents
on hand to watch.
These discussions with parents should be brief and conducted out of the
earshot of the youngster, to provide the best environment for receiving
honest feedback about how the child feels. You can hold these private con-
versations over the phone or in person during scheduled times before or
after a practice.
The following sections discuss some of the topics you want to be sure to
cover with parents.
Finding out whether the kids are having fun
You see your players for abbreviated periods — sometimes just for an hour
once a week for practice before a Saturday-morning game — so you’ll find it
hard to gauge a child’s real feelings about lacrosse, the events of the season
so far, and you.
247
Chapter 13: Refining Your Coaching Strategies

Having an open, honest discussion with the parents about whether their
child is having fun usually results in a candid response. The parents know
whether their son can’t sleep the night before a game because he’s too
excited — or too nervous because he’s feeling pressure to play well. They
know whether their daughter dreads going to practice or enjoys it so much
that she wants to be the first one on the field. Whatever insight you can gain
is important for evaluating the player’s performance, and may help you
understand the athlete better, too. Parents are your primary source for the
most reliable information, so tap into that source to get a true sense of how
the season is going.
Be prepared for honest answers. Even though you may be doing a wonderful
coaching job, a child may be having a miserable experience. What some par-
ents divulge to you may sting, but you’d rather have honest feedback and an
open conversation than hear that everything is great when it really isn’t. If a
child isn’t enjoying the season, you owe it to him to explore every possible
way to reignite his interest and restore the fun.
Whenever you find out about any problems that a child is wrestling with, act
quickly to correct them. It isn’t fair to the player to allow problems — no
matter how big or small — to linger for another couple of practices or games
after you become aware of the situation. Maybe her parents can provide a
solution for you, or perhaps having a chat with the youngster can tell you
everything you need to know to make her situation better. 
Addressing other common problems
Following are a few suggestions for addressing common problems:
 Doesn’t feel connected to the team: Maybe the youngster got separated
from all his buddies when the league formed the teams. Have the kids do
their prepractice stretches with partners so they bond with other players.
 Too much contact: Lacrosse can be a rough sport. Some youngsters are
going to grow tired of getting knocked around. If so, you can’t do much
but perhaps suggest another sport that may better suit the child.
 Haunted by old mistake: Embarrassing incidents happen. A child may
completely misplay a ball or trip over her own feet while running.
Sometimes, the less attention you give it, the less likely she may be to
worry about it.

Taking Your Drills 
to the Next Level
In This Chapter
 Enhancing offensive skills
 Raising the level of play defensively
 Crafting quality practice plans
A
s your season moves along, you’ll encounter more twists and turns than
an amusement-park roller coaster, but we’re confident that you’re up to
the task of handling everything that comes your way. One of the most common
challenges that youth lacrosse coaches face — and must be prepared for — is
adjusting to players’ new and improved skills from week to week.
To keep the learning and good times going strong, you must introduce drills
that grab kids’ attention, get them excited about lacrosse, and give them plenty
of chances to develop a variety of offensive and defensive skills. If you turn to
the same drills every time you get together with your team, your practices will
flop, and the fun will quickly drain out of the season.
In this chapter, we give you all sorts of original drills that you can use to meet
your players’ needs and propel them to improved levels of play.
Upgrading the Offense
Opponents use a lot of defensive techniques and strategies in an effort to stop
your offense from doing what it wants to do: put the ball in the net. Teams that
are well versed in all offensive areas of the game, from cradling and passing to
catching and shooting, will enjoy playing lacrosse more and will derive more
satisfaction from their experience — especially when they see their efforts
pay off with quality scoring chances and goals.

250
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 
This section provides drills you can use to help raise your players’ offensive
skill level. Many of these drills feature both an offensive and defensive
component, so all players will benefit regardless of their roles.
Although the drills in this section focus on the offensive element, be sure to
keep a close eye on how players handle their defensive responsibilities, too.
You don’t want players to develop bad habits or use poor techniques, regard-
less of the skill you are concentrating on.
Cradling
Whether a youngster is a defender, midfielder, or attacker, being able to move
with the ball while going at top speed and making cuts is important for enjoy-
ing lacrosse and playing it well. The cradling drills in this section help players
master one of the most basic skills of the game.
Dip and Dodge
Sometimes, it’s fun to incorporate parents into your drills just to give your
practices a different look and feel. This drill is a good one to use for this pur-
pose; it doesn’t require much effort on the parents’ part, and your players
will get a kick out of running through it.
What you need: Approximately ten parents and one ball for each player.
How it works: Position the parents in a line down the length of the field,
spacing them 10 yards apart. The players line up at one end of the field, each
player with a ball in her stick.
1. On your command, the first player runs toward the first parent.
2. As the player approaches, the parent lifts one arm to waist level.
3. The player cuts around the parent quickly, in the opposite direction of
the raised arm, and continues at full speed toward the next parent.
4. Again, the player moves in the direction opposite whichever arm the
next parent opts to raise.
Coaching pointers: You don’t want the kids standing around waiting to run
through this drill, so make sure that you keep it moving. When a player
reaches the second parent, get the next youngster in line moving. You can
easily have several players maneuvering through the line of parents at the
same time. Or if you have enough parent volunteers, you can set up two
courses, split the kids into two groups, and run both drills at the same time.
You can add a competitive element for older players by timing them to see
which one can negotiate the course fastest.

Ground-Ball Scoops
Loose balls on the field represent golden opportunities for your team to go
on the offensive — if they’re able to scoop up the balls quickly while on the
move. This drill helps develop that skill so that your opponents don’t claim
all the loose balls on game day.
What you need: Two players and a bucket of balls.
How it works: Position one player about 15 yards away, facing you. The other
player stands a couple of yards away from you, facing the other player.
1. Roll a ball to the first player’s left or right.
2. The player moves toward the ball, scoops it up, and delivers a pass to
the player standing next to you.
3. As soon as the first player releases the pass, roll another ball that he
must scoop up and pass to his teammate.
Coaching pointers: Be sure to mix up the ways you roll balls to the youngster
to scoop up. Besides rolling balls to his left and right, mix in some that force
him to charge forward, and put some over his head so that he has to turn and
chase them. Players need to execute all these moves during games when a
ball is loose on the field.
The older the players are, the more challenging you can make this drill by
rolling the balls faster or farther.
Passing and catching
Opponents hate facing teams that can pass and catch the ball well. If your
players are good at moving the ball around and down the field, without turn-
ing it over by making sloppy or inaccurate passes, they get more chances to
put shots on goal. The following drills help mold your players’ passing and
catching skills.
Face ’Em Fours
When your players are adept at making and receiving passes, they generate
more offensive scoring power. This drill enhances hand–eye coordination —
a valuable asset in passing and catching the ball.
What you need: Five players and two balls.
How it works: Position four players in a line, spacing them 5 yards apart.
Another player stands 10 yards away, facing the foursome, with two balls at
her feet.
251
Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

1. The single player scoops up the first ball and passes it to one of the
other four players.
2. As soon as she releases the ball, she scoops up the second ball.
3. While the passer is delivering the second ball to another player, the
youngster who caught the first ball sends it back to the passer.
4. The drill continues with the players trying to keep both balls going at
the same time.
Coaching pointers: This drill puts a real premium on the individual player’s
ability to catch and release the ball quickly. Make sure she’s keeping her stick
in the proper position to receive passes. If she allows her stick to drop too
low, she wastes valuable time raising it to catch the passes. You want her
catching the ball, controlling it, and passing it to a teammate as quickly as
possible. Remember, the faster your team can make passes, the more likely it
is to keep the opposing team off balance.
Rotate the kids so that they all get a chance to be in different positions in the
line, as well as be the designated passer.
3-on-2
Drills that simulate game conditions not only build skills, but also give kids
some of that always-valuable confidence. When they encounter similar situa-
tions on game day, they can carry over from the practice field the way they
executed the skill and enjoy similar success. This drill helps players become
proficient in attacking an outnumbered opponent and also bolsters their
defensive skills.
What you need: Five players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in front of the net. The three
offensive players begin about 25 yards from the net; the two defensive players
face them, about 15 yards away. On your command, the offensive group attempts
to maneuver the ball and score a goal.
Coaching pointers: One of the keys to turning 3-on-2 advantages into goals is
to keep constant pressure on the defense. Any time a defense is outnumbered,
the more you force it to move and the more field you force it to cover, the more
chances you have to put shots in the net. You want the player with the ball
driving toward the net, which forces a defender to move to cover him. If no
one slides over, he’s in good position to shoot; if a defender does cover him,
one of his two teammates will be open to receive a pass.
You can turn this drill into a competitive game by awarding 1 point to the
offense for each goal scored and 2 points to the defense for a stop. See which
unit can reach 10 points first. You can keep the drill moving by allowing only 20
seconds for the offense to get off a shot.
252
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

Shooting
Shooting drills are the best part of practice for most of your players, so you
want to make sure that the drills are entertaining enough to match the players’
enthusiasm about this part of the game. The drills in this section qualify, if we
do say so ourselves.
Beat ’Em
The most effective offensive players can deliver accurate shots on goal while
being harassed by defenders. This drill helps players become more comfortable
releasing shots while being pestered by an opponent.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: The goalie takes her position in the net. The player who will
serve as the passer stands 20 yards from the goal, with a ball in her stick. The
player to whom she will pass begins 15 yards from her and 10 yards farther
back (see Figure 14-1). A defensive player stands even with the passer, also 15
yards away.
1. On your command, the offensive player runs toward the defender,
cuts around her, and receives the ball from the passer.
2. As soon as the ball carrier maneuvers past the defender, the defender
turns and pursues her.
3. The ball carrier attempts to move in on the goalie and get off a shot,
while the defender tries to make the shot more difficult by sticking
with the attacker and not allowing a clear opening to shoot at.

Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

Coaching pointers: This drill encompasses several skills, including making an
accurate pass to the cutting attacker. If the pass is off target even just a little bit
and forces the intended recipient to slow down or reach back to make the catch,
the defender has a chance to recover and can defend more easily. Encourage the
defender to hustle at all times, because she doesn’t know whether the pass
will be on target.
When the offensive player is moving in on the goal, you want him focusing on
the net, not looking over his shoulder at the defender or checking his stick to
view the ball.
Long-Range Targets
Even though you’d like to think that every time down the field, your team will
generate a shot in close on the goalie, that isn’t going to happen. So your
players must also be able to execute long shots, which can pose problems for
goalies when they’re made correctly. This drill helps players upgrade this
area of their game.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in the net. Two offensive players
begin about 20 yards from the goal, with 15 yards between them (see Figure
14-2). One player cradles the ball in his stick. The lone defender stands 5
yards from the player who doesn’t have possession of the ball.

1. The player who has the ball passes it to his teammate (1).
2. After the teammate catches the ball, the defender closes in on him (2).
3. The ball carrier cradles the ball and runs toward his teammate (3),
who sets a pick on the defender (4).
4. As the ball carrier circles around his teammate (5), if the pick has
been successful, he uses the opening to fire a shot on goal (6).
5. If the defender manages to stay with the player, and a shot isn’t available,
he passes the ball back to his teammate, who takes a shot on net.
Coaching pointers: After the offensive player has set the pick, if the defender
has stayed with the ball carrier, you can allow the attacker to use one-on-one
moves to get in a little closer for a shot. Tweaking the drill this way also
makes it more challenging for the defender and allows the offensive player to
work on his long-range shooting skills, as well as other important offensive
techniques.
Facing off
Every time a goal is scored (ideally, by your team!), a face-off occurs. After
putting the ball in the net, your team can keep the momentum going by gaining
control of the face-off and attacking again. Or if your team has just surrendered
a goal, getting possession of the ball and mounting an attack can help keep the
opponent from dominating the game. Read on for some face-off drills that can
help your players become more effective in this area of the game.
Play Starter
A successful face-off requires teammates to work together. If your players are
good at reading and reacting to a face-off, they’re more likely to win possession
of the ball and go on offense rather than defense. This drill helps your team
control those valuable face-offs.
What you need: Six players, two pylons, and one ball.
How it works: Split the six players into two teams of three players. Set a
pylon 20 yards behind each face-off player.
The midfielders for both groups take their positions, with the center midfielders
in the face-off circle (see Figure 14-3).The midfielder to the face-off player’s right
provides defensive support by positioning herself along the wing area line on
her team’s defensive side of the field. The midfielder to the face-off player’s
left takes a position that relates to where she thinks the ball will be directed.
255
Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

1. On your command, both face-off players vie to control the ball or
direct it to a teammate.
2. When a team has control of the ball, it attempts to move the ball
toward the pylon.
A team scores 1 point when a player who is cradling the ball touches the
pylon.
3. The first team to score 5 points wins the drill.
Coaching pointers: Communication is key for executing face-offs, so give the
groups a few seconds to strategize on the type of play they want to work on
to gain control of the ball. Having the pylons in play forces the players to think
about playing defense, too, because they can’t go after the ball without being
concerned about what will happen if they overcommit and don’t come up
with the ball.
Be sure to rotate the kids on each face-off so that they gain experience taking
face-offs as well as reacting to them.
King of the Hill
At advanced levels of play, identifying your best face-off players is important,
because the more times your team can gain possession of the ball from face-
offs, the better their chances of being successful on offense. This drill helps
shed light on who your best face-off players are and provides practice for the
kids in several other elements of lacrosse.
What you need: Four players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: The goalie takes his position in front of the net. Two players
stand at midfield for the face-off; the two remaining players stand on each
side of the face-off.
1. On your command, the two face-off players vie for possession of the ball.

2. As soon as one face-off player secures possession, the other two players
join him on offense.
3. The other face-off player takes a defensive role and tries to prevent a
goal from being scored as the threesome moves the ball down the
field to attack.
Coaching pointers: Pay close attention to which players are winning most of
the face-offs, because at advanced levels of play, these players are the ones
you want taking face-offs on game day.
Make sure that the kids are using a variety of face-off techniques. Often, a
player will stick with the technique that he’s good at, which is counterpro-
ductive; your practice sessions should work on those techniques that players
aren’t as skilled at performing.
Dialing Up the Defense
If you want to spice up your practices and give your players some challeng-
ing drills to test their defensive mettle, this section suits your needs. The
assortment of drills here can push players who have a good understanding of
basic defensive skills to the next level — and beyond. By implementing these
drills or tweaking them to fit your team’s needs, you’ll keep your practices
fresh, fun, and productive.
Defending one-on-one
Good defensive play — the kind that smothers opponents and gives them little
room to operate — requires each player to handle her own responsibilities
when her team doesn’t have possession of the ball. The following drills help
players raise their defensive level of play.
Defensive Denial
When you are looking to rev up your defensive tenacity, turn to this drill. It
features both individual and team defensive components, so players get work
facing an opponent’s one-on-one moves while teaming up with a partner to
shut down an attacker.
What you need: Four players, one goalie, and one ball.
How it works: One player stands at midfield; another player stands 10 yards
away from him, with a ball next to him. The other two players stand back in
the vicinity of the goal (see Figure 14-4).
257
Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

1. The player next to the ball scoops it up and delivers a pass to the
player at midfield (1).
2. When the player at midfield catches the ball (2), the passer assumes a
defensive role.
3. The player with the ball attempts to maneuver past the defender (3).
When the ball carrier reaches the restraining line, the defender is out of
the drill.
4. The ball carrier continues toward the net and works to get off a shot
on goal (4) while being defended by the other two players.
Coaching pointers: Watch to make sure that the ball carrier is using the proper
techniques for protecting the ball so that he doesn’t surrender it during 
any phase of this drill. When the drill becomes the attacker against the two
defenders, you want the defenders to communicate on their coverage. If the
attacker gets off a quality shot, be sure to address with your defensive players
the breakdown that occurred and what they need to do to correct it. (For tips
on providing feedback that players will embrace without having their
confidence shaken, check out Chapter 6.)

Be sure to switch the players around so that all of them get a chance to be
the single attacker, as well as to play one-on-one defense and to work with a
defensive partner.
Chase and Cover
The ability to react quickly to passes and cover defenders leads to good
defense and fewer breakdowns against an attack. This drill helps players
learn to make these types of adjustments quickly.
What you need: Four players and one ball.
How it works: Designate three players as passers and one player as a defender.
The object of the drill is for the three players to keep the ball away from the
defender. Run the drill in two-minute segments, and see how many times 
the defender is able to gain control of the ball.
Coaching pointers: Be sure to limit the playing area; that way, the offensive
players can’t simply spread out so far apart that the defender has no chance
to cover all the territory. To mix the drill up a bit, you can add another
defender to the mix.
One of the great aspects of this drill is that you can run it in different sections
all over the field with different groups of players. As always, remember to rotate
the kids so that all of them get the chance to be a defender as well as a passer.
Dueling Sticks
Good team defense is vital for keeping the ball out of your net whenever the
opponent is attacking, especially when the attack originates from behind
your net. This drill works on defending attacks that begin back there.
What you need: Three players and one goalie. A ball.
How it works: One attacking player begins behind the net, with the ball in
her stick. The other offensive player starts in front of the net about 10 yards
from the goalie, who is in her normal position in front of the net. The defensive
player takes a position between the two offensive players. On your command,
the two offensive players try to work the ball into position to score, while the
defender and the goalie attempt to deny a shot from in close.
Coaching pointers: The defender is at a distinct disadvantage simply because
she is outnumbered, which makes this drill challenging. Don’t allow the defender
to become frustrated; keep encouraging her to work hard, because the more
she hustles, the better chance she has of denying a goal.
If you find that the drill is too hard for the majority of the kids, add another
defender to even things up.

Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

Manning the net
Stopping fast-paced shots from all angles is a real challenge for goalies at all
levels. Run your goalies through the following drills to help them become better
at stopping the different types of shots that will be fired their way during games.
Angle Action
During games, goalies face a barrage of shots from many angles, and they often
have the added challenge of simply trying to locate the ball while their vision is
partially blocked by screeners or other traffic in front of the net. This drill helps
goalies become accustomed to dealing with those annoying screens.
What you need: Three players, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: Two players set up to the right and left of the goalie, about 15
yards away from the net. A third player sets up in front of the crease area
with a bucket of balls (see Figure 14-5).
1. The player in front of the crease scoops up a ball, fires a pass to one
of the two players (1), and slides over a couple of steps so that he is
standing between the goalie and the shooter (2).
2. The player who caught the pass takes a shot on goal (3).
3. Based on the location of the shot, the screener moves to his left or
right, or jumps up in the air, to avoid being hit by the ball.
4. The goalie must locate the shot and stop it.
Coaching pointers: One of the keys to dealing with screens is for the goalie to
maintain good positioning. You want him to maintain proper footwork and learn
to lean to his left or right to see around the screen. When he begins moving his
entire body to look around a screen, he takes himself out of position — a
mistake that good offensive teams capitalize on quickly.

Rebound Bonanza
Loose balls around the front of the net can present problems for defenses,
especially if their opponents manage to scoop up the balls first. This drill
helps goalies deal with rebounds so that opponents don’t have the luxury of
taking several shots on goal during a possession.
What you need: Two players, one goalie, and a bucket of balls.
How it works: A player takes a position behind the net, with a bucket of
balls. Another player sets up about 15 yards from the goal. The goalie
assumes her normal position in the net.
1. The player behind the net delivers a pass to the player out in front,
who catches the ball and takes a shot on net.
2. As soon as the first ball goes into the net or is stopped by the goalie,
the player behind the net rolls another ball out in front of the net.
3. The goalie and shooter go after the ball just as they would for a
rebound during a game.
4. If the shooter scoops up the ball, she attacks again and tries to score
a goal.
or
If the goalie secures the ball, the drill ends momentarily until both
players return to the starting position to run through it again.
Coaching pointers: Run this drill at a fast pace to match the intensity of an
action-packed game. Be sure to mix up the direction of the rebounds, as well
as the distance, so that goalies get a chance to practice going after and get-
ting their hands on all different types of rebounds.
Corner to Corner
Goalies without good reflexes are likely to be about as effective in their jobs
as chefs without skillets. This high-intensity drill helps sharpen a key skill.
What you need: Two players, one goalie, and two buckets of balls.
How it works: Position one player behind the net with a bucket of balls and
the other player about 10 yards in front of the goalie with another bucket of
balls. The goalie assumes his normal position in the net.
1. The player behind the net passes a ball out to the player in front.
2. The player in front catches the ball and moves in on the goalie to take
a shot from in close.
261
Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

3. As soon as the shot is released, the player behind the net scoops up a
ball and circles around the net from either the left or right to take a shot.
4. While this player is on the attack, the player out in front returns to his
bucket and scoops up another ball.
5. After the player who began behind the net takes a shot, he returns to
his starting position to scoop up another ball, and the player out in
front launches a shot.
6. The drill continues with the same sequence of shots.
Coaching pointers: Because the goalie faces a barrage of shots during this
drill, monitor his footwork closely. Whenever a lot of shots are fired in suc-
cession, young goalies tend to get their feet crossed or neglect some of the
basic fundamentals. The attackers hold the clear advantage in one-on-one
settings, so be sure to applaud your goalie’s effort, and make a big deal out of
any saves that he makes. Also, encourage the attackers to use a variety of
shots, including those that bounce short of the goalie.
You want to build up not only your goalie’s skills, but also his confidence.
The more confident a goalie is in his skills, the more success he’ll have on
game day turning away shots.
Putting It All Together: Sample
Practice Sessions
One of the first steps to being a successful lacrosse coach is having an array
of drills that target different areas of the game and using those drills to enhance
players’ skills, as well as their understanding and enjoyment of the sport. The
drills we introduce in this chapter fill that bill, and you can tweak many of them
to suit your team’s needs. You can make them more challenging or even scale
back the difficulty level a notch or two.
In the following sections, we provide a couple of different practice plans.
Beginner practices
This one-hour sample practice includes a mixture of the introductory drills
presented in Chapter 7 and some of those featured in this chapter:
262
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

 5 minutes: Have the kids go through a warm-up and stretching routine. This
routine is especially important for older or more-advanced players, who are
more likely to be injured when their muscles aren’t loosened up properly.
 10 minutes: Use the Dip and Dodge drill to get the practice off to a fun-
filled start, with players working on their cradling skills while weaving
around Moms and Dads on the field.
 10 minutes: Split the team in half. At one end of the field, run the Partner
Passes drill (Chapter 7) as a refresher on the fundamentals of passing
and catching the ball. At the opposite end of the field, go with the Target
Shots drill (Chapter 7). After 5 minutes, rotate the players so that all of
them have a chance to participate in both drills.
 15 minutes: After the refresher on passing and catching the ball with the
Partner Passes drill, the 3-on-2 drill gives them the chance to use those
passing and shooting skills in a more-competitive setting with defenders
challenging them. While this drill is going on at one end of the field, you
can have the King of the Hill drill running at the other end of the field so
that players can work on their face-off techniques. Be sure to rotate the
kids so that all of them get practice in both drills.
 5 minutes: Use the Ball Chase drill (Chapter 7) to refresh the kids on the
proper techniques for scooping up loose balls.
 10 minutes: Play Starter is a perfect drill to follow up with, as players
can transfer the skills they just worked on to this drill. You can run Play
Starter in different parts of the field so no one is forced to stand around.
 5 minutes: Conduct a cool-down session with some light stretching.
While the kids are going through these stretches, pump them up by
telling them how proud you are of their efforts. They’ll leave the field
feeling good about themselves and will be eager to return for the next
practice or game.
Include in your practices a few basic drills that you can turn to frequently to
help ingrain the fundamental techniques of lacrosse.
Don’t conduct practices in which every drill you run is new to the players.
You’ll waste too much time explaining how all the drills work, which cuts into
the amount of time kids have to run around on the field working on their skills.
Introducing a few new drills at each practice is all right, but make sure that
you keep the explanations brief; otherwise, the players’ energy and productivity
will fizzle.
263
Chapter 14: Taking Your Drills to the Next Level

Intermediate practices
Here is another 1-hour practice, based on the drills covered in this chapter:
 5 minutes: Use your standard warm-up and stretching program to prepare
the kids’ bodies for practice.
 5 minutes: Use the Ground-Ball Scoops drill to work the kids into the
rhythm of practice while focusing on a basic skill.
 10 minutes: Break the team into groups of five for the Face ’Em Fours
drill to work on their passing and catching skills.
 10 minutes: The Chase and Cover drill fits nicely into the practice
schedule here, because it builds on the preceding drill by adding a
defensive component to the passing and catching.
 15 minutes: Split the team in half, with the group at one end of the field
running through the Long-Range Targets drill and the other group work-
ing on the Defensive Denial drill at the opposite end of the field. The
Defensive Denial drill can be run without a goalie, so if you have only
one goalie, who is involved with Long-Range Targets, this drill is perfect
to run at the same time.
 10 minutes: Break the team in half, and run the Rebound Bonanza drill
at one end of the field and the 3-on-2 drill at the other end. Again, if you
have only one goalie, the 3-on-2 drill can be run without a goalie.
 5 minutes: End practice with a brief cool-down routine. Remind the kids
of any changes in the schedule that they need to be aware of, and thank
them for paying attention and doing their best throughout the session.

eaving around defenders, connecting on long passes with teammates,
and scoring goals rank as some of the most significant parts of attacking
in lacrosse — and as some of the most popular with kids, too. But many other
advanced elements define how effective a team is when it has possession of the
ball, and these can also be a lot of fun for the kids to perform. As your players
gain more skills in these other areas, they’ll get more enjoyment from playing
lacrosse, and you’ll create a more potent offense.
Here, we go on the offensive, detailing how you can upgrade your team’s play
by running fast breaks and capitalizing when you have a player advantage. We
also present useful information on using picks to create openings and on the best
approaches for attacking from behind the net. Read on to rev up your offensive
attack and keep those opposing defenses off balance.
Changing Offensive Approaches
As your players gain valuable game-day experience, they become more profi-
cient at moving the ball down the field, attacking opponents, and (we hope)
scoring lots of goals. As they progress on the offensive end, of course, many 
of the teams they go up against will also make great strides defensively. Being
able to call on different moves and modes of attack to help generate scoring
opportunities for the team is a real asset in the goal-production department,
and for keeping pace with the improved play of opposing defenses. Here, we
discuss some advanced offensive techniques to help your team create chances
to put the ball in the opponent’s net on a regular basis.
When you’re introducing offensive sets, strategies, and plays, the simpler, the
better. You’re much better off focusing on a few plays and helping the kids
become proficient in those rather than overwhelming them with too much
information. If you pile on the plays too quickly, your team won’t be completely
comfortable — or efficient — at executing any of them.

Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching
Running the fast break
Fast breaks are some of the most exciting and action-packed plays in lacrosse —
especially when your team is running them instead of defending them! They
can materialize at any time during a game, so if your players are good at
recognizing and taking advantage of them, they have more potential to
develop good scoring opportunities.
The four-on-three is one of the most common fast breaks, and it often poses
the most problems for defenses because they have a lot of territory to cover
and only three players to defend it. Whenever an opportunity for this fast
break occurs, one of the keys is for the three attackers to race down the field,
keeping their eyes on the ball and setting up in the defensive zone in a square
formation with the ball carrier, who often is a midfielder (see Figure 15-1).
The ball carrier’s first responsibility is to attack the goal area so that defend-
ers are forced to converge on him. If they don’t, he’ll be in position to take a
shot on net, and if they do, he should look to pass the ball to a teammate.
Ideally, if one of the two attackers nearest the net is open after cutting toward
the goal, he should deliver a pass to those teammates. Here are a few other
coaching points to keep in mind in orchestrating fast breaks that produce
coveted goals:
 Constant hustle: Teams that hustle nonstop throughout the game generate
more fast breaks than those that don’t. Never hesitate to emphasize this
fact to your players.
 Quick movement: The quicker your team passes the ball, the more chal-
lenging defense becomes. When offensive players stand still, or the ball
carrier slows down or doesn’t keep her feet moving, the defense gets

valuable time to regroup and set up. When defenses are forced to react
constantly to attacks and passes, they run a greater chance of a breakdown
that results in a good scoring opportunity for the offense.
 Constant cutting: Players who use cuts and spin moves to get open will
reap the benefits of their hard work by receiving passes and getting
chances to take shots on goal.
 Moving to open spaces: It does little good for a player to cut into an
area where a teammate already is (unless he’s heading there to set a
pick), because that move makes it easier for the defenders to cover both
players. Cutting into an open space puts pressure on the defenders to
stick with him because he doesn’t have support nearby.
Any time your team can push the ball into the attack-goal area outnumbering
the opposition, chances are good that a quality scoring chance will develop.
Reading the defense
The better your players are at recognizing what type of defense is being
played against them, the greater their chances of depositing the ball in the
net. Most teams rely on player-to-player defense. At the more-advanced
levels of play, teams resort to zone defenses a little more often. And some
teams interchange the two types throughout a game in an effort to keep the
opponent off balance. Instilling in your players the confidence that they can
conquer any type of defense paves the way to success and fun on game day,
and prepares them for their future in lacrosse.
Player-to-player defense
In player-to-player defense, each defender is responsible for covering a spe-
cific offensive player. (Check out Chapter 12 for more details on this type of
defense.) Following are some points about confronting this defense to share
with your team:
 Use good attackers. If you have good attackers who are excellent at
dodging and passing, you can create scoring opportunities for your team
against the player-to-player defense. (Dodging refers to a player maneu-
vering the ball past a defender to weaken the defense and create an open
shot for herself or a teammate. For more on the terms of the game, flip to
Chapter 3.)
As soon as the ball handler gets by her defender, other defenders are
forced to adjust to account for the unguarded player; if they don’t, she
has an open shot. If another defender does slide over to offer support,
the ball handler can pass to her teammate whom the other defender left
unguarded.
267
Chapter 15: Stepping Up the Offense

 Capitalize on weak defenders. When you recognize that one of the
opponent’s defenders isn’t as quick as some of your attackers, you want
the ball in that offensive player’s stick so that he can attack and create
scoring opportunities for himself or carve out openings for his teammates.
Zone defenses
In a zone defense, defensive players are responsible for covering specific areas
of the field, based on the location of the ball. This type of defense is used most
often when a team is down a player due to a penalty. (For more on penalties,
check out Chapter 3.) Keep these coaching tips in mind when going against
zones:
 Keep good spacing. Although this offensive concept is an important one
to adhere to throughout the game, it’s especially key for dealing with
zones. The closer together your players are, the easier they are for
opponents in a zone to defend. Spread out your players so that the
defense has to worry about covering more of the field. The more field
area a defense has to cover, the greater the chances that lapses and
breakdowns will occur.
 Use passes across the field. Passes that go from one side of the field to
the other can weaken a zone that is overcommitted to one side of the field.
Using ball movement to your advantage
You can have a roster full of players who are fast and strong, and who deliver
on-the-mark passes, but if they don’t keep that ball moving when they’re on
the attack, their offensive productivity will nose-dive. If your players move
the ball around a lot, the defense will encounter challenges stopping them.
If your attackers can’t maneuver past defenders (see Chapter 11 for tech-
niques for eluding opposing players), you need to rely on other methods to
get the job done, such as setting picks (check out “Using picks to create
openings,” later in this chapter) and passing (see Chapter 9).
During your practice drills or scrimmages, require the unit with the ball to
have each player possess it before anyone takes a shot. This requirement
puts a premium on passing skills. Also, the kids will be more likely to make
quick passes and get that ball moving around, because the sooner everyone
gets their stick on the ball, the faster they can fire a shot at the net.
268
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching

Operating with the player advantage
Whenever your opponent commits a penalty and must play a player short, you
want to capitalize, because this gives you a great opportunity to take a high-
percentage shot and put a goal on the scoreboard. To help your team register
goals while operating with a player advantage, keep these tactics in mind:
 Use ball reversal. You don’t want players to get into the habit of simply
making passes to the nearest teammate. Have them reverse the ball
across the field, too. Sure, long passes are tougher to make, but with
practice, your team will become more efficient at making and catching
these passes, which in turn will produce a more potent offensive attack.
 Be patient. Patience is a virtue, and that goes for executing your extra-
player offense, too. Players don’t need to be firing shots just a few sec-
onds into the advantage — unless, of course, they have a great scoring
opportunity. Talk to them about being patient and working the ball
around the field to produce a quality scoring chance.
 Practice plays. During your practices, work on a couple of plays that
your team can call upon when these extra-player situations arise.
Knowing these plays will give them confidence that in a game situation,
they can execute the plays and score goals against the defense.
When you introduce a play during practice, first run it without any defenders
to give the kids a chance to see how the play is supposed to unfold and
where they need to be positioned during its execution. It also helps them
become comfortable with their roles before going against defenders.
You never want players to pass up good open shots just for the sake of run-
ning through a set play to its entirety. If the play calls for a specific player to
deliver a pass, but she’s not being covered and can move toward the net to
take an undefended shot, you want her to do so. As players gain experience,
they’ll learn when they can exploit openings to the advantage of their team.
Generating Scoring Opportunities
Players who have the offensive basics of the game down reasonably well —
such as cradling, passing, catching, and shooting — are ready to move to the
next level. Helping them get there is up to you. Players who have an array of
offensive skills to draw on get more satisfaction out of the game, and they’ll
probably be more effective on the field. Next, we look at several techniques
that will bolster your team’s attack and lead to more scoring opportunities.
269
Chapter 15: Stepping Up the Offense

Using picks to create openings
One of the most effective techniques available for freeing up a teammate from
the defender covering him is a pick. Sometimes players are unable to dodge a
defender on their own, so a pick can be a helpful alternative.
A pick is an offensive maneuver in which one player attempts to block the
path of a defender guarding another offensive player, just like what is done in
basketball to free a player up from his defender so he can take an open shot.
Picks are used in both boys’ and girls’ lacrosse. When a pick is set, it takes
the defender out of good defensive position and often leads to a good scoring
chance. Work with your players on the following techniques so that picks can
comprise a slice of your offensive attack:
1. The player setting the pick moves toward the defender she intends to
set a pick against, stopping about a foot away from that player.
2. She plants her feet slightly beyond shoulder width apart and main-
tains a firm stance.
3. She holds her stick in tight to her body, in a vertical position.
4. The player whose defender is being picked runs toward the pick.
Work with the player to brush shoulders with her teammate who’s setting the
pick to force the defender to step around the pick to avoid making contact
with that player. When executed properly this usually allows the teammate to
gain at least a step advantage over the defender.
Due to breakdowns in defensive coverage, the player who set the pick is
often open to receive a pass. After executing the pick, she must turn quickly
so that she’s ready to receive a pass and attack the goal before the opponent
has a chance to recover and scramble back into position.
Attacking from behind the net
One of the best signs of a good offense — besides keeping the scoreboard
operating busy on game day punching up goals! — is being able to attack
from all over the field. When your team is capable of executing different plays
from different spots on the field, it keeps the other team off balance, because
the opponents can’t zero in on stopping anything in particular.
270
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching

Setting up an attacker behind the opponent’s net is one way to go about scor-
ing goals. Following is one type of play your team can run from this position
to keep the goalie guessing and create some scoring opportunities:
1. When your team has the ball behind the opponent’s net, two team-
mates prepare a pick above the crease area.
The two players begin the play out in front of the crease, several yards
away from each other (see Figure 15-2).
2. The player on the right runs across the top of the crease area and sets
a pick on the defender covering his teammate (see Figure 15-3).
3. The player whose defender is picked circles around his teammate
with his stick up to receive a pass from his teammate behind the net.
4. He quickly unloads a shot on net before the defense has a chance to
react to the pick and deny the scoring opportunity.
Incorporating different plays into your attack keeps the game fresh and fun
for the kids, because they won’t have to be robotic in their execution.

Chapter 15: Stepping Up the Offense

Entering the attack-goal area
Ball possession is as important to your team as a parachute is to a skydiver.
Every time your players have their sticks on the ball and have moved it down
the field, you want them to be able to make the most of their opportunities.
Whenever your team moves into goal-scoring territory (which we hope will
be often!), keep the following coaching points in mind:
 Don’t be predictable. You don’t want your players doing the same thing
every time. A predictable offensive attack makes the defense’s job easy,
because the opponents have a good idea what you plan to do. The more
you keep the defense off balance, the more goals you’re likely to score.
 Hone some set plays. To break down the opposition, rely on a few set plays
that the kids have become proficient at executing. You want to use the
plays that your kids are comfortable running — and have the confidence
to execute — during the opening minute of a game or the final seconds
of a contest in which they are trailing by a goal.

 Use all the players. Don’t rely on only one or two players to take all the
shots or to break down the defense with their dodges. When designing
plays, make sure that you create a variety so that all your players — not
just the most talented ones — have the chance to be the focal point.
Besides making all your kids feel like real parts of the team, this tactic is
a good strategic move, ensuring that the defense can’t focus on stopping
one particular player.
 Use screens. You can’t expect to score all your goals from in close each
time you take the field. Some goals have to come from the outside, and
that’s where screens are useful. Scoring long-range goals can not only be
a big boost for your team, but also can demoralize the opposing goalie’s
confidence and shift the game’s momentum to your side.
In screening, an offensive player positions herself near the crease to
block the goalie’s view of the shot, similar to what is done in hockey 
to prevent the goalie from getting a clear view of the incoming shot.
Screening isn’t the most enjoyable task on the field — after all, the player
must put herself in the line of fire between the shooter and the goalie —
but it can make a huge difference in offensive productivity.
The screener should position herself about a yard in front of the crease,
facing the shooter, and in a direct line between the shooter’s stick and the
goalie. The screener holds her stick in tight against her body, and when a
shot is taken, she jumps to the side (or up in the air, if the shot is low) to
avoid being hit by the ball. Then she turns quickly to face the goal to
scoop up any rebound or deflection that may have occurred.
Players who are capable of setting screens are just as important as those who
possess strong, accurate shots. Take the time to teach this aspect of the
game to your players; your offense will reap the benefits.
Fending off body checks
Getting knocked off balance and taken to the ground by an opponent’s check
(in boys’ leagues that allow checking) isn’t fun. Facing teams that have good
checking skills can make executing on offense seem very difficult. Your job is
to help your players learn to avoid the check — or at least fend off a lot of the
force of it — so they aren’t taken out of the play or don’t surrender possession
of the ball. Players will derive enormous satisfaction from sidestepping an
273
Chapter 15: Stepping Up the Offense

oncoming defender. Defenders want to alter the attacker’s path and steal the
ball, so the offensive player’s concern is shielding his stick to help keep the
ball from getting loose. Here’s a way to deal with checks:
1. The player who’s being checked turns his body sideways to protect
his stick.
2. He moves his top hand up near the throat of his stick. This gives him
more control while cradling, which is necessary with hard checks (see
Figure 15-4).
3. Holding his stick vertically, he takes the contact from the defender
and keeps his eyes on the defender, not on the ball in his stick.
Holding the stick horizontally makes it easier for defenders to pry the
ball loose, so the player should keep the stick vertical.
4. As the check is delivered, the ball carrier leans in to the defender. He
keeps his feet spread about shoulder width apart, which helps him
maintain his balance when contact is made.
5. He raises his forearm nearer the defender around chest high. This
move helps absorb some of the contact.

 Shutting down the opposition
 Upgrading your goalie’s skills
O
ne really neat aspect of a lacrosse season is that no two games are the
same. You constantly adapt to changing game conditions, whether in
defending an explosive offensive team that scores goals with assembly-line
precision or protecting a lead in the closing minutes. The one constant every
time your team takes the field, though, is the important role of defense. If
you’re coaching advanced-level players, or a team with good defensive basics
and ready for a skills upgrade, you’ve come to the right place. Here, we discuss
playing defense while your team is down a player, protecting the crease area,
and dealing with picks. We devote an entire section to goaltending —from
dealing with stick fakes to igniting attacks with good clearing passes.
Playing Strong Defense under Attack
A lacrosse game often hinges on one key play or situation. A game could come
down to how well your defenders protect the crease and keep the opponent
away from the net in the final minute. Perhaps the game’s momentum will shift
when your defense keeps the opponent from scoring despite a one- or two-player
advantage. Or maybe your squad will defend picks perfectly and frustrate them
by denying them good scoring chances. Players who are well versed in all
aspects of playing sound defense and who perform defensive skills well while
they’re under attack will have more success on the field and get more out of
their playing experience.
Defending the goal area
What separates great defensive teams from good ones is their ability to deny
offenses good scoring opportunities. Sure, good passing teams with talented

players will produce their share of openings to take shots — and tally goals —
but the more knowledgeable your team is about all aspects of defense, the
more success it will have when the opponent sets up at your end of the field.
One of the best defensive techniques your players can use when opponents
are charging toward your goal is the stick-on-stick hold, in which a defender
closes in tight on an attacker. Here’s how it’s executed:
1. Keeping his stick horizontal, the defender moves his hand at the top
of his stick down toward his bottom hand (see Figure 16-1).
2. He keeps his feet wider than shoulder width apart.
If he moves his feet toward the attacker, he exposes himself to a spin
move, which can lead to a good scoring opportunity.
3. He presses the heel of his bottom hand against the opponent’s upper
arm (see Figure 16-2).

Operating in the crease
Although playing strong defense is important all over the field, it’s especially
important around the crease area. A defensive breakdown in this area, allowing
an opposing player to slip free, puts the goalie in a difficult position and often
leads to surrendering a goal. Work with your players on the following pointers:
 Avoiding screens: Goalies fare better stopping the shots that they can
actually see coming toward the net, so defenders must be mindful not to
block their goalie’s vision in the net. They also must keep opposing players
from camping out in front of the crease area and blocking the goalie’s
line of sight.
 Holding the sticks up: Players should keep their sticks in the air while
operating in the crease area. Because the crease and the surrounding
area are often congested, holding their sticks vertically allows your players
to move quickly and to weave between or around players more easily
than if their sticks are horizontal to the field.
 Keeping up the chatter: Good communication becomes imperative in
this area. Besides the goalie letting her defenders know where they need
to be positioned, other players near the crease can alert teammates to
picks or screens that the opposition is attempting to set.

Chapter 16: Tightening the Defense

Defending against the fast break
A big part of attacking in lacrosse involves creating situations in which the
offensive players outnumber the defensive players, such as in fast breaks,
which can result in some open shots on goal. One of the best indicators of a
well-coached team is how it responds in challenging defensive situations so
that the opponent can’t use fast breaks to produce goals. Whenever the
opponent has a fast-break, how the defense fares depends on key areas:
 Deny the high-percentage shots. Chances are that the opposition will be
able to get off a shot; your defenders’ job is to make sure that the shot
isn’t a high-quality one. That means forcing attackers out of the middle
of the field and denying passes there, too.
 Use the triangle formation. One of the most efficient formations to use
against a fast break is the triangle. This alignment features one defender
about 10 yards in front of the goal (see Figure 16-3) and a defender on
either side of him, back closer to the goal:
• The player out front at the top of the triangle is referred to as the
point. His primary responsibility is to make contact with the
opposing player advancing the ball toward the goal. His focus
should be on checking the opponent as he approaches to prevent
passes to teammates, as well as an open shot.
• The two back defenders, aligned to the right and left of the goal
post and 3 to 5 yards in front of the edge of the crease, must react
quickly to any passes. If the pass goes into the corner where the
right defender is, for example, he slides over to provide coverage,
while the defender on the opposite side of the crease shifts to the
front of the net to help prevent passes to the center of the field.

Working with the man-down defense
When your team commits a penalty and finds itself down a player, your
defense faces a difficult challenge — not only in preventing a goal, but even in
stopping a quality shot from being taken. Whenever your defense is a player
short, each youngster must cover a little extra territory.
Make sure you focus on this area of the game during your practices. During a
scrimmage, for example, randomly sit a player out so that her teammates get
a chance to work with the player advantage, as well as defend against it. (Be
sure to give the players you’re taking out of the scrimmage a drill to work on
along the sidelines, so that they aren’t forced to stand and watch.)
You can teach your team a basic 2-3 zone alignment (see Figure 16-4) to defend
the field when your team finds itself a player short. In this setup, defenders
are responsible for covering a specific area of the field rather than an individual
player:
 The two midfielders on the perimeter use poke checks to apply pressure
and make it hard for the ball carrier to pass to the middle of the field.
 The defender in the middle keeps an eye on opponents cutting toward the
net to receive passes. She can’t afford to stray too far from her position;
otherwise, she’ll leave a gap that an opponent with good attacking skills
can pounce on.
 The two defenders on the outside of the middle defender cover the
action around the goal posts and converge on any opponents who enter
the middle area in front of the net.

Chapter 16: Tightening the Defense

Dealing with picks
A pick is simply an offensive player’s attempt to block the path of a defender
guarding another offensive player. (For more on lacrosse terms, see Chapter 3.)
The first step in countering this maneuver is recognizing that it’s being set
up. As soon as one of your defenders or your goalie sees an opposing player
moving to set up a pick, he needs to shout, “Pick!” This shout alerts the
defender who is the target of the pick so that he’s prepared to deal with it.
The defense has two different options for negating a pick:
 The player who is being picked fights past the pick and stays with the
player he’s covering.
 If your defenders communicate well, you can have them use the switch.
The player who’s being picked simply switches his coverage to the other
player (see Figure 16-5).
Preventing a team from clearing the ball
Because of the fast-paced nature of lacrosse, possession changes hands
(actually, sticks) all over the field at any time. Teams that can make the tran-
sition from offense to defense in the blink of an eye can deny the opponent
opportunities to clear the ball and formulate an attack. Attempting to prevent
an opponent from clearing passes and regaining possession of the ball is known
as riding. Teams that employ effective riding techniques can be frustrating for
opponents to play against, because they make pushing the ball up the field a
real challenge. The more passes your team can force the opponent to make, the
greater the chance of a turnover.
When executing the riding technique, the defender approaches the opponent
at an angle (see Figure 16-6). While keeping his bottom hand on his stick, he
runs alongside the opponent and swings his stick up across the opponent’s
chest (see Figure 16-7). Be sure to keep the stick under control so as to avoid
a slashing penalty. Using good body position that turns a player around is
more important than risking a penalty by trying to take the ball away.

Whenever possible, your players should ride an opponent toward the side-
line, which becomes a sort of extra defender as it limits movement options.

Chapter 16: Tightening the Defense

Guarding the Goal
Playing good defense is a team effort, but much of the responsibility falls to
the goalie, who puts the exclamation point on a defensive effort by stopping a
shot. In this section, we discuss how your goalie can make shots more diffi-
cult to convert to goals and help your players push the ball down the field
and generate scoring opportunities of their own against the opposing goalie.
Using the upper body against stick fakes
When attackers charge in on goal, looking to score, they often resort to using
stick fakes to lure the goalie out of position so that more of the net is
exposed. Being successful in the nets requires recognizing when stick fakes
are being used — and, of course, not falling for them. Following are some
coaching pointers for dealing with stick fakes:
 Be patient. When an opposing player attacks the net, the goalie natu-
rally is eager to react to the player’s moves and make a stop — some-
times, a bit too eager. When a goalie reacts too quickly to moves, he
takes himself out of position and leaves a larger section of the net open
for shots. Coach your goalies to wait until a shooter releases the ball
from his stick before committing to moving and making the save.
 Maintain good positioning. During practices, work with your goalies to
remain square to the shooter at all times. If they focus on remaining square,
they will be less likely to lunge at the attacker or to allow themselves to
be pulled in the direction of the fake.
Using the legs to stop shots
Low shots are challenging for young goalies to deal with, because those shots
may bounce or skip along the ground. Also, they force the goalie to move her
stick quickly from around chest high (see Chapter 10 for a rundown of the
basic position goaltenders should use) to ground level. Goalies must rely on
good leg movement to execute the underhand block — the best technique for
dealing with low shots. Here’s how to do this block:
1. When the goalie’s right hand is on top of the stick at the throat, she
rotates it so that the pocket is closer to the field than the handle and
she pushes her left elbow out to the side (see Figure 16-8).
2. Keeping the pocket of the stick square to the ball, she pushes the stick
downward with her right hand.
282
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

3. She steps toward the ball and moves the head of the stick slightly for-
ward to meet the shot.
4. If the shot is low, she keeps her feet close together behind her stick.
This stance is extra protection in case the ball gets past the stick.
The goalie should always step toward the shooter’s stick with her closer foot.
She should focus on being square to the shooter’s stick, not body, because the
attacker can move the ball to one side to create a different angle for the shot.
Retrieving loose balls
Loose balls that reside outside the crease area — usually, the result of rebounds
or deflected shots — represent opportunities for the opposition to take shots
from in close, if the goalie doesn’t get there first. To deny attacking players
possession of these coveted loose balls, the goalie must act quickly, using the
proper technique to get his stick on them.
1. He moves toward the loose ball and lowers the head of his stick so
that it skims the top of the field. 
Figure 16-8:

283
Chapter 16: Tightening the Defense

2. He bends down low and keeps his eyes focused on the ball as he
makes contact with it with his stick. 
3. He brings the ball up so that he’s in position to deliver a pass to an
open teammate if there’s a fast-break opportunity.
Sometimes, a goalie wanders out of the crease to secure a loose ball, only to
have an opposing player beat him to it and get a wide-open net to shoot the
ball into. After getting beaten this way a few times, the goalie may be reluc-
tant to venture out of the crease to go after loose balls, but encourage him to
remain aggressive and pursue any that are within his range. Goalies become
better at these types of plays with experience.
Executing passes to begin attacks
Your attack can originate from many areas of the field, including in front of
your net. A goalie who is good at clearing the ball with short, medium, or
long passes can help your team advance the ball down the field quickly and
mount an attack that keeps the opponent off balance.
Clearing refers to moving the ball out of the defensive end of the field and out
of trouble. Here’s how a clearing pass is delivered:
1. A right-handed goalie puts her left hand on the butt end of the stick
and her right hand just below the middle of the stick.
2. She brings the stick over her right shoulder so that it’s close to parallel
to the field (see Figure 16-9).
3. She steps toward her intended target with her left foot.
4. She uses her bottom hand to pull her stick down toward her stomach.
5. She pushes her top hand forward and snaps her wrist toward the
intended recipient.
6. She follows through, bringing her stick across to her left hip.
Following are some pointers on clearing that your goalies can use:
 Focus on the sides. Clearing passes should be directed to teammates on
either side of the field. The goalie should avoid sending passes to the
middle of the field, simply because if an opponent intercepts the pass,
she’s in dangerous scoring territory with the ball on her stick.
 Avoid rainbow throws. Ideally, a clearing pass should be a straight line
with just a little arc, rather a big rainbow that stays in the air a long
time. The longer the ball is in the air, the more time the opposition has
to react to it, and the less likely the pass will reach the intended target.
284
Part IV: Net Gains: Advanced Lacrosse Coaching 

 Capitalize on the view. Goalies are in the best position to see where the
opposition’s positioning is weakest, because they can survey the entire
field. When a goalie sees a teammate breaking free down the sideline, if
he recognizes the situation and executes a clearing pass to that teammate
quickly, there is a good chance of catching the opponent off balance and
out of position — a great way to create a quality scoring opportunity.
 Recover and reorganize. As goalies gain experience, they become much
better at evaluating how the opposing players are positioned and when
it’s appropriate to attack with a long pass, and when teammates down-
field are too well covered and a less risky pass is called for. 
 Don’t turn the ball over. If the defender is applying aggressive pressure
on the goalie, she must take a few seconds to gain her composure before
delivering a clearing pass. You never want your goalie to feel pressured
into making a bad pass that gives the ball right back. Have her survey
the field and take her time determining where the ball should go.

T

tips, and looks at some ways you can help reduce the

Staying Healthy and Injury Free
In This Chapter
 Consuming the right foods and liquids
 Getting your players in lacrosse shape
 Tending to injuries
You know that coaching a youth lacrosse team involves all sorts of respon-
sibilities. Coaching also involves dealing with injuries and explaining how
proper nutrition and hydration affect performance. In this chapter, you find every-
thing you need to know about reducing the risk of injuries on the field. We go over
how to treat the minor injuries that pop up (such as cuts and sprains) and how to
recognize the major injuries that require immediate medical attention. We also
provide detailed information on nutrition and hydration: the foods and fluids
kids should be consuming to enhance their performance, as well as the ones 
they should steer clear of.
Promoting a Healthy Diet
You can teach kids how to deliver a pass to a teammate on the move, but if
they aren’t eating the right foods before arriving at the field, their performance
will be compromised. Although you can’t control what your team eats before
practices and games, you can affect it to a certain degree by what you teach
them about good nutrition and how it affects performance. Spend some time
discussing the importance of good nutritional habits.
Discussing nutrition with your players (and even with their parents) can make
a difference in what they consume before practices and games, and it may even
affect their eating habits on a regular basis. TV commercials push candy bars,
chips, and sugar-coated cereals, but nutrition is in the basic food groups.
Children can gain healthier eating habits if you explain what a difference it

can make in their ability to play lacrosse. Two primary ingredients fuel a
child’s muscles and get used up the longer the activity goes on:
 Fluids: Kids lose fluids through perspiration, which is why water is so
vital to keep their body temperatures from rising during exercise. The
longer children exercise without replacing lost fluids, and the more
extreme the temperatures and conditions happen to be that day, the less
effective their performances will be, and the worse they will feel overall.
 Glucose: Glucose is a carbohydrate sugar and an important muscle fuel.
It’s carried to the working muscles through the bloodstream and stored
in the muscles as glycogen. A child steadily depletes his glycogen stores
throughout a lacrosse contest. The more carbohydrate fuel a child loses
during competition, the less energy he has to perform at his peak.
Talking to kids about how today’s food choices can affect their health years
from now won’t be very effective, because young minds really can’t relate to
the long term. But if you frame your discussion in terms of how their meal
this morning affects their performance in the game this afternoon, you’re
much more likely to grab their attention. Keeping your discussion focused on
the short term has a much greater chance of influencing kids’ eating habits.
Fueling up before the game
When your players show up at games with empty stomachs — or after
devouring burgers, fries, and sodas — their energy levels are low, and they
have trouble performing and concentrating. A nutritious pregame meal clears
the way for children to execute at their optimum level. Youngsters should eat
a healthy meal (or at least some healthy snacks) comprised of plenty of car-
bohydrates to have the muscle energy to play and perform at a high level.
The pregame meal should be rich in carbohydrates, which convert to energy
faster and more efficiently than other nutrients. Pastas, breads, cereals, and
whole grains, along with fruits or vegetables work well. Good pregame snacks
include bagels, yogurt, dried fruit, fresh fruit, energy bars, fruit granola bars,
and whole-grain crackers with peanut butter or cheese.
Encourage your players to stay away from candy, cookies, and doughnuts
because the high sugar content will leave them feeling sluggish once the sugar
leaves their bloodstream. Fatty food like bacon should be avoided because it
takes longer to digest, and foods high in salt content are also a big no-no
because they can result in the child retaining fluids and even feeling bloated.
290
Part V: The Extra Points 

Players should consume their pregame meal about two hours before the
game. They should avoid eating within an hour of game time, because their
bodies will spend the first half digesting the food, detracting from their
performance.
If your players feel sluggish in the second half or don’t seem to perform as
well as in the first half, you may be able to trace the problem to their diet. If
so, experiment during practices by changing the players’ eating habits to find
what works best for them. Have them consume healthy snacks before a prac-
tice, for example, and see whether they notice any difference in their energy
levels later in the practice. If they typically get tired toward the end of your
practices but feel more energetic after consuming some of those healthy
snacks, they can use that knowledge and eat like that before games, too.
If your team has a morning game, and the kids simply aren’t able to get up
early enough to have a proper pregame meal, make sure that they focus on
eating a nutritionally sound dinner the night before. This meal should be a
big serving of pasta with some vegetables, chicken, or fish. Even the night
before a game, kids should steer clear of candy, ice cream, and other sweets,
which can rob them of much-needed energy on game day.
Filling up after the game
What you say to your players following a game affects their confidence and
self-esteem, as well as how they view their lacrosse skills. Similarly, what the
players eat following a contest affects their bodies and how they feel.
Rewarding kids for a game well played with a tasty snack is a lot of fun and a
nice gesture for their hard work, but regularly giving them junk food sends
the wrong message about the importance of proper nutritional habits.
Following are some postgame tips to keep in mind:
 Concentrate on carbohydrates. Carbohydrate-rich foods that also have
some protein value are the most beneficial foods for youngsters to eat
after a day of running up and down the field. Ideally, the postgame meal
or snack should resemble the pregame meal, the only difference being
that the portions are a little bit smaller. Turkey sandwiches, fresh fruit,
and crackers with cheese are great postgame foods.
 Feed them fast. The sooner your players get food into their stomachs
after a game, the better. Plenty of research indicates that youngsters get
the greatest benefits by consuming foods packed with carbohydrates
within 30 minutes after a game or practice.
 Occasional junk food is OK. You know the saying “Everything in moder-
ation.” The same goes for those foods that aren’t the most nutritious but
that kids love, such as pizza and ice cream. Indulging your team with
these tasty treats occasionally is perfectly OK. But if you give junk food
regularly, your messages about nutrition will go to waste.

Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

Drinking Up: Keeping Players Hydrated
The importance of children consuming lots of fluids, and the right kinds of
fluids, simply can’t be stated enough. When kids are running up and down
the field trying to generate scoring opportunities, and exerting lots of energy
attempting to keep the other team away from the goal, their body tempera-
tures climb. Children who don’t consume adequate amounts of water during
games — especially those contested in hot and humid conditions — are at
increased risk of becoming dehydrated and suffering muscle cramps, heat
exhaustion, or heat stroke.
Muscle cramps generally affect the quadriceps, hamstrings, or calves. When
enough fluids aren’t consumed, the muscles that are being used a lot can go
into spasms and tighten up on the youngster. Coaches can massage the tight
muscles to help them loosen up, as well as have the player do some light
stretching of the affected area. Applying heat, along with massage, helps pro-
mote blood flow to resolve the problem.
Heat exhaustion is caused by dehydration, and symptoms include profuse
sweating, nausea, headache, chills, dizziness, and extreme thirst. Immedi-
ately have the child moved to a cool, shaded area, and have him consume
cool fluids. You should also apply ice to his neck and back to help cool his
body. Seek medical attention.
Heat stroke is much more severe: The child’s life is in danger because he stops
sweating, which pushes his body temperature to dangerously high levels. Call
emergency medical personnel immediately. Warning signs are red or flushed
skin, rapid pulse, rapid breathing, vomiting, seizures, unconsciousness, and
cardiac arrest. While waiting for medical personnel to arrive, cool the player’s
body with wet towels or pour cool water over him. Ice packs should be applied
to the neck, back, abdomen, armpits, and between the legs. Provide cool fluids
if the player is conscious. If he’s unconscious and vomiting, roll him onto his
side to keep his throat clear.
The younger the children, the less they sweat, because their sweat glands
aren’t completely developed at this stage in their life. As a result, their bodies
soak up more heat when they play games in high temperatures and humidity.
What players should drink
Players should consume adequate water before, during, and after games.
Flavored sports drinks are also good sources for fluids, as the electrolyte
content prompts fluid intake and fluid retention and distribution in the body.
292
Part V: The Extra Points 

Do your best to keep the kids from drinking caffeinated beverages. These
types of drinks are no-nos because they act as diuretics — exactly the oppo-
site of what you’re trying to accomplish in keeping the kids hydrated. Also
keep kids away from carbonated drinks; carbonation discourages drinking by
making a child feel fuller.
Energy drinks should also not be consumed by children. These typically pro-
vide about as much caffeine as an average cup of instant coffee, twice as
much as in a can of soda pop. Plus, the amount of sugar is usually higher
than what is found in other beverages, which can slow the body’s absorption
of water, making them unhealthy to use during or after activity. Because caffeine
is a stimulant, it increases heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature,
and if too much is consumed, it can cause changes in the heart’s rhythm.
How much players should drink
How much water should your players be drinking? The amount varies,
because game conditions dictate whether they need increased water con-
sumption to remain sufficiently hydrated. Also, with so many different body
types, kids sweat at different rates and need different levels of fluids to keep
themselves hydrated.
Although the condition is rare, you should be aware of water intoxication, also
known as hyperhydration or water poisoning. It occurs when large amounts of
water are consumed in a short period of time, causing a potentially fatal distur-
bance in brain function. Symptoms include confusion, inattentiveness, blurred
vision, poor coordination, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing, and drowsiness.
Healthy youngsters are at little risk of overconsuming water, however, and
should never refrain from drinking it to rehydrate during physical activity.
The best preventive measure for kids participating in activities that promote
heavy sweating, such as lacrosse, is to consume fluids to help maintain elec-
trolyte balance. This means drinking plenty of the right kinds of fluids the day
before the game, as well as on game day. Remind players that all the sweat that
comes out of their bodies must be replaced by fluids, which is why it is
important to consume them throughout the game. When a person’s water
and electrolyte intake matches what the body has sweated out, water intoxi-
cation isn’t likely to occur.
When players should drink
Generally speaking, you want kids consuming water whenever possible. They
should drink a glass of water with their pregame meal, consume water during
the pregame warm-up, and sip water whenever they come out of the game.
293
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

After expending a lot of energy, your players need to consume lots of fluids to
replenish what they lost. Giving them water after a game helps their livers
and kidneys push out waste, a key element in helping their bodies recover.
Don’t worry that drinking water will compromise players’ performance. Most
kids drink based on need, with thirst being the mechanism that tells them to
drink. If you schedule plenty of water breaks, you won’t have to worry about
kids sitting on the sidelines chugging too much water and not being able to
perform on the field.
Never withhold water as a form of punishment for any player who is misbe-
having or who fails to adhere to your team rules. Proper hydration is just too
important to a child’s health and well being. No matter how serious the issue
is or how disappointed you are in the youngster’s actions, never resort to
cutting off fluids. (For details on dealing with problem players, turn to
Chapter 18.)
Hydration tips
Here are some additional tips to help keep those young bodies hydrated and
performing at their most efficient levels:
 Talk about hydration in simple terms. If you’re coaching younger children,
even though they hear you telling them to take drinks of water, chances are
that they still aren’t consuming as much as they should be. During a break
in practice or a timeout during a game, try telling the players to take a
specific number of sips of water. This type of instruction helps ensure 
that the kids get enough fluids into their bodies.
 Encourage drinking. On game day, many kids are so into the game and
excited about what is going on out on the field that they forget about
consuming water, so you have to encourage them to drink. During time-
outs and at halftime, when you’re providing encouragement and dis-
cussing game strategy, remind the players to drink water. Kids should be
sipping from their water bottles while you talk to them.
 Get the parents involved. Parents can help you ensure that your players
are properly hydrated. On the car ride over to the game, for example,
the parents can have their child drink some water. Spreading the water
intake out helps ensure that a child’s body remains hydrated and that he
doesn’t become bloated by trying to drink too much in one sitting.
 Always have extra water available. Be sure to bring extra water so that
it’s readily available to refill any water bottle that runs dry. You can even
designate a couple of different parents each week to be responsible for
bringing extra water, because you should never have a shortage of water
at any practice or game.
294
Part V: The Extra Points 

Schedule plenty of water breaks throughout the practice. Any time a young-
ster needs water, encourage him to get a drink. You should never withhold
water from a child for any reason.
An Ounce of Prevention: 
Conditioning Your Team
Conditioning your players is just as important as teaching them different
aspects of shooting and defending, particularly at the more-advanced levels
of lacrosse. Consider this: If your team is talented on the attack and great at
defending, but is gasping for air several minutes into the game, its effective-
ness nose-dives, and the opponent can take advantage at both ends of the
field. Even lesser-skilled players who are well conditioned are big assets to
the team; they can cause havoc for the opposition by chasing down loose balls
in the second half of a game when other players are too tired to retrieve them.
Because lacrosse involves lots of running mixed with short, high-intensity
bursts — such as when players are attacking or forced to defend an attacker —
the best-conditioned players are those who have a combination of aerobic and
anaerobic fitness so that they can perform at their top levels all game long.
You may already be familiar with these terms, but just in case, here is a brief
refresher:
 Aerobic: Aerobic fitness refers to the level at which youngsters can take
in and use oxygen. The stronger a youngster’s heart and lungs are, the
longer she’s able to run up and down the field without tiring.
 Anaerobic: Anaerobic fitness pertains to how long a youngster can per-
form at high intensity, such as sprinting after a loose ball or darting past
a defender and down the field.
Players who are tired and fatigued are at greater risk of injury than those who
have more energy in their tank. Also, players often become sloppier in their
technique when they don’t have the energy to move their feet and get into
the proper position. During games, keep a close eye on those kids who are
tiring and could use a breather on the bench.
It’s a good idea to have a signal kids can use — such as raising a fist — to let you
know that they are tired and need a break. You don’t want a player shouting out
to you from the field that he’s tired; the opponent will hear this information
and exploit it by attacking the tired player.
295
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

The most productive practices incorporate a variety of the skills needed to
play lacrosse without overwhelming kids in the process. The same goes for
conditioning them. When you can incorporate conditioning into your prac-
tices without the kids even realizing that it’s taking place, they will reap more
benefits. Although having kids run mind-numbing laps around the lacrosse
field will get them in better shape, it’ll also bore them and may even drive
them away from the sport. Also, you’re wasting valuable practice time if you
just have the players run without doing anything else at the same time.
Instead, use drills that emphasize constant movement and eliminate standing
around. Your players will be more conditioned — and more effective, too!
(Check out Chapter 7 for some great practice drills.)
Getting players’ hearts pumping
Devoting a few minutes at the start of practices to getting the kids’ bodies
warmed up paves the way to a more productive session and reduces the risk
of injuries. The younger your players are, the less elaborate your warm-ups
need to be. You can simply have the kids perform some basic jumping jacks
and light running to get them ready for the action on the field. If you’re over-
seeing an older and more-advanced lacrosse team, you’ll want your warm-up
to be much more specific to meet the players’ needs.
At the more-competitive levels of lacrosse, including the travel-team level (for
details on coaching a lacrosse travel team, flip to Chapter 19), you sometimes
know in advance which players will be on your team. If so, you can meet with
them before the season to discuss conditioning. You can encourage them to
begin running to help build up their cardiovascular endurance, which will
enable them to perform at higher levels for longer periods on game day. If they
have access to weights, you can also encourage them to do some lifting —
always under adult supervision. You can even ask a professional trainer from a
local gym or a strength-and-conditioning coach from a nearby collegiate team
to share insights on this aspect of the game with your players.
Cooling down in practices and games
Warm-ups play an important role in getting kids’ bodies prepped for partici-
pation, and though they are easily overlooked, cool-downs following practices
and games are equally important for maintaining the long-term health of your
team. The cool-down helps reduce muscle soreness, aids circulation, and helps
clear waste products from the muscles. After practices or games, have your
players perform some light stretches — perhaps some of the same stretches
that you used for the pregame warm-up.
296
Part V: The Extra Points 

Have your players get into the habit of going through the cool-down process
every time they participate in a practice or game. The cool-down doesn’t
have to be quite as focused as the warm-up session, because the purpose is
to wind down from an activity rather than build up to one. Completing a cool-
down takes only a couple of minutes, and the kids will reap benefits.
Following a game, you can turn the cool-down period into a fun activity for
the kids by talking to them about some of the interesting or humorous aspects
of the game while they go through their stretches. Joke with them about any-
thing unusual or funny that may have happened in the game. Or take a more
serious approach with the older players, and highlight some of the positives
that unfolded. You can point out how well they executed a fast-break opportu-
nity or how well they defended the opposition’s attack, for example.
A Pound of Cure: Recognizing 
and Treating Injuries
Eliminating the threat of injuries during practices and games is impossible,
although how you handle them when they do pop up has a significant impact
on how the children view their future lacrosse participation. Thankfully, most
of the injuries you’ll likely encounter will be minor in nature. Bumps, bruises,
scrapes and the occasional twisted ankle will be the types of injuries that you
will see most often. The quicker you respond to them and provide the neces-
sary treatment the less likely a child will be traumatized by the injury and be
ready to return to action.
Bringing your first-aid kit
A first-aid kit is like a health insurance policy: You need to have one but hope
you never need to use it. Injuries are part of lacrosse, so you must come to
practice prepared to deal with injuries. Some leagues issue a first-aid kit to
each coach; others leave it up to the coach to bring supplies to the field.
If the league doesn’t provide first-aid kits, talk to the program director about
the importance of having them; perhaps she can correct the oversight. In the
meantime, never conduct a practice or go to a game without your kit. Check
out Chapter 17 for the run down of the items that should be in the kit.
297
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

You should stock your kit with the following items:
 Antiseptic spray or wipes: Use these items to clean out cuts and abrasions.
 Athletic tape: Tape can hold ice bags in place when you need to reduce
swelling around an injury.
 Bandages in different sizes: Use waterproof bandages to cover cuts and
scrapes.
 Bee-sting kit: You can pick up one of these kits at your local pharmacy
and have it on hand in case one of your players gets stung.
 CPR mouth barrier: You need one of these items in the event that a
child needs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
 Emergency tooth-preserving system: Use one of these kits for a tooth
that gets knocked out. You can pick it up at a local pharmacy or ask your
dentist where you can purchase one.
 Freezer-type storage bags: Plastic storage bags are great for holding ice
packs.
 Hot and cold packs: For applying to injured areas of the body.
 Insect repellant: Use repellant to combat those pesky bugs that can take
a bite out of the fun.
 Latex gloves: You need to wear gloves while dealing with bloody cuts and
wounds. If any parents mention to you that their child has allergies to
latex, be sure to stock your kit with gloves made of a different material.
 Nail clippers: A pair of clippers comes in handy for repairing torn nails.
 Prescriptions: You need to be aware of any medical conditions that
youngsters on your team have. If a child has asthma, for example, make
sure that his parents give you a spare bronchodilator to keep in your first-
aid kit in case the child forgets his and the situation calls for it.
 Scissors: You need scissors to cut bandages and athletic tape.
 Sterile eyewash and prepackaged sterile eye pads: You need these
items when any type of debris becomes stuck in a child’s eye.
 Tweezers: Use tweezers to remove any debris that becomes lodged in a
child’s skin.
Keeping accurate records
Whenever a child suffers an injury that you provide any type of treatment for,
be sure to write down the nature of the injury, how it happened, and exactly
how you handled it — including whether you applied a bandage or ice and
298
Part V: The Extra Points 

any other steps you took. Record this information in your practice planner or
in a separate log book. Do so the same day, while the event is still fresh in
your mind.
Regardless of how minor the injury is, be sure to inform the child’s parents
about what happened and how you treated it. Never withhold information
from them for any reason.
Unfortunately, we live in a litigious society, so having an accurate account of
everything that transpired is vital in case you need to recount what happened —
in a court of law, for example. Having detailed notes of everything that
happened protects you from unwarranted accusations.
Detailed practice plans, with dates, are evidence that you taught your players
specific skills safely and properly, so they also protect you against unfounded
lawsuits. Don’t discard these records after the season is over. Keep these
accounts, along with your dated practice plans and notes, for several years.
Tending to Common Lacrosse Injuries
Most injuries that your players suffer involve bumps, bruises, cuts, and twisted
ankles. These injuries may seem minor to you, but they may seem pretty major
to a child who suddenly sees blood on her leg or is unable to put any weight
on her ankle when she tries to walk. By acting quickly and administering the
proper treatment for routine injuries while comforting the youngster, you can
usually help her bounce back and return to action fairly quickly.
Never give aspirin or any other types of over-the-counter medications to
children unless you have written permission to do so from the parent or
guardian. Also, if you will be providing any type of prescription medicine to
children, always make sure that you have the instructions and consent from
the parent in writing.
Cuts and scrapes
Cuts and scrapes can produce major tears among young players, but luckily,
they are minor injuries that you can treat quickly and effectively with the
materials in your first-aid kit. Just be sure to keep the following pointers in mind:
 Wear latex gloves. Any time one of your players suffers a cut, the first
thing you should do is grab a pair of latex gloves or use some other type
of blood barrier to limit your contact with the blood.
299
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

 Apply direct pressure. You can stop bleeding by applying direct pressure
to the wound with a clean dressing. If you have trouble stopping the
bleeding, elevate the child’s injured area above his heart while
maintaining the pressure.
 Clean it. After you stop the bleeding, clean the wound. You can use pre-
moistened towelettes or over-the-counter alcohol swabs and antibiotic
creams to clean minor cuts and scrapes.
 Cover it. Use a bandage or piece of sterile gauze to cover the cut, and
secure it tightly in place with athletic tape, particularly if the child is
interested in continuing to play.
 Discard the trash. Place your gloves and any other materials that may
have blood on them in a sealed bag, and put the bag in the trash so that
no one else risks coming into contact with these materials. Check with
your league to see if the facility that you practice and play at has special
containers that are used to discard these types of materials.
Although fearing HIV/AIDS is certainly understandable, it should never be a
factor in providing help to an injured player on your team. You’re at risk only
if you allow the blood of an HIV-positive person to come into contact with an
open wound that you have. If one of your players has AIDS or is HIV-positive,
the parents certainly should make you aware of this fact during your presea-
son parents’ meeting, which we discuss in Chapter 4. Whether you’re aware
of the player’s HIV status or not, however, the fact that you’re wearing latex
gloves provides the protection you need to treat the injured child.
Twists, sprains, and strains
Because lacrosse is a contact sport that requires players to run at full speed
and make all sorts of sudden stops and cuts, collisions involving different
parts of the body take place all over the field.
If you are coaching in a boys’ league that allows checking (for more details on
checking, head to Chapter 10), injuries may be even more prevalent.
Some of the movements that players execute — and some of the collisions
that accompany them — can result in muscle strains and sprains, as well as
bruises. Because lacrosse involves all areas of the body, from the ankles and
knees for running to the wrists and shoulders for shooting, you have to be
prepared to tend injuries to all body parts.
300
Part V: The Extra Points 

When a player strains a muscle or twists an ankle, keep in mind the RICE
method for treatment:
 Rest: Immediately get the child to the sideline so that she can rest the
injury. If the child has twisted her ankle, for example, have an assistant
coach or a parent from the stands help you carry the child off the field
so that she doesn’t put any additional pressure on the injured area.
 Ice: Apply ice to the injured area. The ice helps reduce the swelling and
pain. Don’t apply the ice directly to the skin; wrap the ice bag in a towel
and then place it on the injured area.
 Compress: Compress the injured area by using athletic tape or any other
type of material to hold the ice in place.
 Elevate: Have the child elevate the injury above his heart to prevent
blood from pooling in the injured area.
After any swelling, discoloration, or pain subsides, you can allow the young-
ster to return to competition.
If any of these symptoms are present for more than a couple of days, how-
ever, the player should be examined by a physician before you allow her back
on the field. You never want a child to return to the field when her injury
hasn’t healed completely, because that puts her at greater risk of reinjuring
the area and missing even more action.
Other injuries
As players become bigger and stronger at the more-advanced and competi-
tive levels of lacrosse, and are capable of running faster and checking harder,
other types of injuries may occur. In the following sections, we discuss some
of these injuries and how you should respond if they occur.
Broken bone
When a child is in a lot of pain following contact — either from colliding with
another player or from landing on the playing field hard or at an awkward
angle — a bone may be broken.
Whenever you sense that a child may have broken a bone, proceed cau-
tiously. Your first step is immobilizing the injured area with a splint. A broken
finger can be propped up with a splint, wrapped gently with tape to hold it in
place until a doctor can examine the injury. When you are dealing with a
more severe break, such as an arm or leg, get medical attention to care for it
properly.
301
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

A broken bone sticking through a child’s skin is the worst-case scenario,
requiring you to call medical personnel to provide treatment. Never try to
push the bone back in. Keep your hands off it, and cover the area with sterile
gauze until help arrives.
Bruises
Bruising results from an impact against the body, such as a ball hitting a player’s
thigh, as blood from the capillaries is released into the tissues under the skin
that leaves a mark that can be black, blue, or even yellowish in color. The bruise
eventually fades as the blood is absorbed by the tissues and carried away. The
best treatment for bruises is to apply ice to the injured area, which stops the
blood flow and limits the size of the bruise. If the bruise swells, or does not
go away within a week, have the child visit a doctor for further evaluation.
Concussion
A concussion is a jarring injury to the head, face, or jaw resulting in a distur-
bance of the brain. Take seriously any type of injury involving a child’s head,
and don’t allow him to resume playing until he has been examined by a med-
ical professional.
If a youngster reports any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention
for her:
302
Part V: The Extra Points 
 Headache or pressure
in the head
 Nausea or vomiting
 Balance problems or
dizziness
 Double or blurry
vision
 Sensitivity to light or sound
 Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, 
or groggy
 Concentration or memory 
problems
 Confusion
A child doesn’t have to lose consciousness to suffer a concussion. Any time
you see a child bump heads with another player, or hit his head on the field
hard after being tripped or losing his balance, remove him from the activity,
and observe him carefully. Be on the lookout for irritable mood swings,
memory loss, and vision problems — telltale signs that a concussion has
occurred.
A youngster who suffers a mild concussion typically needs at least a week to
recover before resuming normal activities. A severe concussion usually side-
lines a youngster for at least a month; in this case, the player needs a
doctor’s OK before returning to the lacrosse field.

Eye injury
All injuries can be pretty frightening to a child, especially those that involve
problems with their vision. Check out the following eye injuries that can
occur during practices and games:
 Foreign object in the eye: Any foreign body lodged in the eye, such as a
fleck of dirt, needs attention. Usually, this kind of injury is simply a
nuisance, but if the irritation doesn’t go away, it needs to be evaluated
by an eye specialist. Symptoms are tearing, pain, and redness.
You can remove most objects easily with a cotton swab and saline wash.
If the surface of the youngster’s eye isn’t seriously injured, and her
vision isn’t impaired, she can return to competition as soon as the
object is removed.
 Injury to the eyeball: A direct injury to the eyeball is a medical emergency.
Symptoms are extreme pain, loss of vision, hazy vision, double vision,
change in vision colors, or obvious lacerations or abrasions of the eye. If
the vision loss is the result of a direct impact to the eye, apply a dry,
sterile eye patch or piece of gauze to the eye, along with a bag of
crushed ice; then immediately get the youngster to an emergency facility
for treatment.
 Poked in eye: Even though lacrosse players wear protective eye gear,
sometimes they still get poked in the eye. If that happens to one of your
players, examine the eye. If the player isn’t in significant pain, and you
see minimal redness and no discharge or bleeding, simply clean the area
out with cool water, and allow him to rest for a while before returning to
play. If you notice any type of discharge or blood coming from the eye,
get the child to a doctor immediately.
 Orbital fracture: A fracture of the bony frame around the eye is serious
and requires expert medical treatment. Symptoms are severe pain, with
possible double vision or other vision problems. These symptoms may
be accompanied by cuts, abrasions, bleeding, and black-and-blue marks.
If any youngster suffers significant injury to the area around the eye, she
should be transported to a facility where she can be x-rayed to determine
whether a fracture has occurred.
Shin splints
Shin splints are common in lacrosse because lots of running is involved. The
primary cause of the injury is related to the weight pounding down on the
shin. Other factors include muscle weakness, poor flexibility, improper warm-
up and cool-down exercises, and improper footwear. This injury typically is
easy to identify: pain in the shin. Shin splints develop in four stages:
1. Pain after activity
2. Pain before and after activity without affecting performance
303
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

3. Pain before, during, and after activity, adversely affecting performance
4. Constant pain that prohibits activity
The early stages of shin splints are relatively mild, but later stages can get
much more severe. If the injury isn’t managed properly, it can lead to a stress
fracture. If a player develops shin splints, use ice to reduce pain and swelling
and forbid weight-bearing activities to allow the affected area time to heal.
Wind knocked out
A youngster who has the wind knocked out of her for the first time may panic
when she has trouble breathing. Comfort her and have her take short, quick
breaths, panting like a puppy until she can resume breathing normally again.
Tooth knocked out
If a child has a tooth knocked out, retrieve the tooth, place it in a sterile gauze
pad with some saline solution, and get the child to a dentist immediately.
Nosebleed
Whenever a group of youngsters are involved in a contact sport like lacrosse,
they run the risk of nosebleeds — particularly in girls’ games, because in
most programs, girls don’t wear full protective helmets like boys do. A lot of
children cringe at the sight of blood — their own or someone else’s — so act
quickly to control the damage. Grab a clean piece of gauze, and put it over
the nose while gently squeezing the youngster’s nostrils together. The gauze
catches any excess blood coming out of the nose and makes the situation
less dramatic for the child. Also, tilt the child’s head slightly forward.
If the bleeding hasn’t stopped after a couple of minutes, the injury may be
more serious, and the youngster should be taken to a doctor immediately.
Handling an emergency situation
Unfortunately, serious injuries sometimes occur, and you must be prepared
to deal with them. Just as you spend time practicing cradling, passing, and
defending attacks with your players, you must go over with your assistants how
you will respond in an emergency. How you respond — and how quickly — can
save a youngster’s life. Following are some tips to keep in mind:
 Know your location. Be aware of the name of the facility where you’re
playing, as well as the address. In the event that you have to call 911,
being able to provide accurate information right away helps ensure that
emergency personnel arrive at the proper location as quickly as possible.
304
Part V: The Extra Points 

 Have each child’s emergency information on hand. Those important
forms we discuss in Chapter 4 are crucial in the event that medical per-
sonnel need to know whether the child is allergic to any type of medication.
Always carry those forms in your first-aid kit, and have them easily
accessible in the event of an emergency.
 Provide only treatment that you are capable of performing. While
awaiting the arrival of medical personnel, provide only the first-aid care
that you’re trained to perform.
 Calm the child. If the youngster is conscious, comfort him by talking to
him in a calm, relaxed voice. Let him know that he’s going to be OK and
that medical help is on the way. If you display signs of being worried or
upset, the child will pick up on them — and likely will become even
more afraid than he already is.
 Alert parents, if they’re not in attendance. If the child’s parents aren’t
in attendance, one of your assistant coaches should be responsible for
calling them to let them know what’s going on. Your foremost responsi-
bility at a time like this is the child, so if you’ve already designated
someone else to make that initial call to the parents, you don’t have to
waste unnecessary time when all your attention needs to be focused on
the youngster.
You must be prepared to assess any injury, including loss of consciousness.
The acronym COACH is a handy reminder. Follow these steps:
 C: Determine whether the child is conscious.
 O: Is the child breathing and getting oxygen?
 A: Ask the youngster where she is hurt.
 C: Control the area that’s painful.
 H: What type of help is required? Decide whether you need to call for
immediate medical assistance and have the child taken to the hospital.
When you’re approaching an injured child, keep the COACH sequence in
mind. Look at his lip color, feel his chest, or put your cheek next to his nose
to see whether he’s breathing. If he isn’t breathing, and you don’t see or feel a
pulse in his neck or wrist, you must immediately initiate cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and have someone call for emergency medical assistance.
305
Chapter 17: Staying Healthy and Injury Free

We strongly recommended that anyone who coaches youth lacrosse (or any
other youth sport) be certified in CPR. All youth lacrosse coaches should
receive CPR and first-aid training from the American Red Cross (www.red
cross.org) or another nationally recognized organization. At every practice
and game, you’re responsible for the safety and well being of every single player.
Take the time to take the class. You’ll be glad you did.
Proceed cautiously when dealing with any injury, particularly one that involves
the head, neck, or spine. Never attempt to move a player with such an injury;
doing can cause further damage. Call for emergency medical assistance anytime
you’re dealing with a serious injury. If a child sustains an injury to the head or
neck, calm her down and restrain her in the position in which you found her
while emergency medical assistance is responding.
306
Part V: The Extra Points 
Calling for calm after an injury
Because of the physical nature of lacrosse,
players may suffer injuries during games. Much
as adult motorists slow down at the scene of an
accident to see what happened, children are
naturally curious and will want to see how their
teammate is doing or get a closer look at what
happened to an opposing player. When a player
goes down with an injury, keep the rest of the
players away from him. You don’t want the
entire team crowding around the injured child; if
he sees everyone hovering with concerned
looks, he may panic. Make sure you go over
with your players in advance how you want
them to behave when one of their teammates or
a player on the opposing team is injured. You
want them to return to their bench area so that
you and anyone else who is helping out with the
team can concentrate on providing care to the
child and call for medical personnel if the situ-
ation is serious. You don’t want your players to
be a distraction or to get in the way unneces-
sarily while treatment is being provided.

S
ome of the most obvious tasks that you’ll devote attention to this season
are teaching your players fundamental offensive and defensive skills,
putting together fun-filled practices, and making game day memorable for all
the right reasons. Other areas requiring your attention include handling all
sorts of problems that can pop up from time to time — problems involving
parents, opposing coaches, your own assistants, and your players themselves.
This chapter lays out everything you need to know to deal with these issues.
We give you tips on doling out discipline to your players who disobey team
rules and share insights on solving those tricky problems with your assistant
coaches when you don’t see eye to eye. We also dig in to how to keep parents’
behavior in check and what to do when it crosses the line, as well as how to
contend with opposing coaches whose methods aren’t appropriate for the
youth lacrosse level.
We hope you don’t encounter any of these unpleasant situations, but if you
do, use the remedies in this chapter so that the problems don’t detract from
your players’ lacrosse experience.
Dealing with Problem Parents
As crazy as it may sound, childish behavior at youth lacrosse games doesn’t
always involve the kids. Any time you bring a group of parents together — all of
whom have different backgrounds, motivations, and hopes for their children —
problems are likely to flare up on occasion. Most of these problems will be
minor in nature and easily rectified; others may take on a more serious tone.

308
Part V: The Extra Points 
Take the time to conduct a preseason parents’ meeting (see Chapter 4), in
which you lay some key groundwork to prevent problems from escalating.
During the meeting, detail your expectations of parent behavior during
games; clearly explain what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate behav-
ior for both parents and children. Then hold everyone, including yourself,
accountable for adhering to this code of behavior.
Laying out your expectations for parental behavior before the first face-off of
the season is important, but it’s by no means a guarantee that every parent is
going to be a model of good behavior all season long. Be prepared to step for-
ward at the first indication of trouble. Any time you allow a problem to linger,
it has the potential to blossom into something much worse.
The following sections look at some of the most common types of problem
parents that you may deal with this season, and discuss the best ways to deal
with them quickly and effectively.
Win-at-all-costs parents
Parents shell out a lot of money to buy their kids lacrosse sticks, helmets,
and gloves, not to mention all the time they spend shuttling them to midweek
practices and weekend games. Naturally, with so much invested in the season,
they want to see their kids excel and reap the benefits of participating. But
some parents may expect their children — and you — to perform at levels that
are entirely unrealistic.
These parents will be satisfied only if their child wins a shiny first-place trophy
that they can display on their mantel at home. This type of expectation —
totally unfair, unrealistic, and unhealthy for the kids — creates a lot of unnec-
essary stress. The additional pressure also infringes on the other kids’
enjoyment of the game and threatens to spoil the season for everyone.
Win-at-all-costs parents place such an emphasis on winning games that losses
are viewed as catastrophic. This unhealthy outlook, along what these parents
are teaching at home about how important winning is, goes against everything
you’re trying to teach the kids about doing their best and having fun.
What makes them tick
Here are a couple of other points to be aware of when dealing with these
types of parents:
 They do whatever it takes to win. These parents want victories for the
team and accolades for their child, and they may resort to any measures
to win. They may shout at referees whenever calls go against their child
or his team; try intimidation tactics to influence the referee’s calls (even
if the ref is a teenager officiating a beginning-level game for minimum wage);

and loudly criticize the opposing coach and team, especially if the other
team happens to be winning or doing a really good job of defending their
child and not allowing him to show off his skills.
 They see a target on your back. Rest assured that your coaching style
will be on these parents’ radar screen for second-guessing and criticism
whenever the outcome of a game doesn’t turn out in your team’s favor.
Everything from how you chose to attack the defense to the types of
face-off techniques your players used during the game will be put under
a microscope and dissected.
Regardless of the age level of the youngsters, these parents are likely to
confront you about the importance of playing the more-athletic kids
more often and benching the less-skilled players, all to help ensure that
the team wins more games and their child receives more playing time.
They critique your game strategy following losses, question your lineup,
analyze your substitution patterns, and offer their unsolicited advice
regarding your offensive tactics and defensive philosophy.
What to do about them
These tips can help you deal with win-at-all-costs parents:
 Take control. Take the approach that when your players step onto the
field, that field is their classroom. You simply can’t allow outside influences
to disrupt your messages about striving to do your best, adhering to the
rules, being a good sport, and accepting wins and losses with dignity. How
parents choose to rear their children, and what they say to their children
at home, is out of your control. But when your practice begins or a game
gets under way, you assume full control, and what you say goes at all times.
 Hold a pregame parents’ meeting. To help stem the competitive tide and
prevent it from enveloping the other parents, give a brief, friendly talk to
all the parents before your next game. Spending a couple of minutes talk-
ing to the entire group, reminding the parents that their children play in a
recreational youth lacrosse league, and pointing out that winning isn’t
the most important factor may help put parents in the proper frame of
mind. If the league has staff members who monitor the behavior of fans,
tell your parents that their actions are being observed and that you’d
hate to see their children embarrassed if parents are asked to leave the
facility because they couldn’t control themselves during the game.
 Talk to parents privately. If you find that the group chat doesn’t help,
arrange to speak privately with any parent who’s still causing disrup-
tions. Share your concerns that her comments are a real detriment not
only to her child’s development, but also to the rest of the team. Be sure
to reiterate that you’re trying to help all the kids learn skills and that
although winning the game is one of the objectives that you’re striving
to achieve (at more advanced levels of play), it’s not the sole objective.
309
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

 Discuss alternatives — and consequences. Let a win-at-all-costs parent
know that if he isn’t happy with your coaching philosophy, he should
consider coaching himself next season or look into signing his child up
for a more competitive team. In the meantime, you need his cooperation.
Tell him that you don’t want him to be absent from this exciting time in
his child’s life, but if the improper behavior continues to detract from
the values you’re teaching, your only recourse will be to speak to the
league director.
Don’t be confrontational in this discussion, but be firm in your stance,
because you have the welfare of an entire group of kids to look out for.
You may also want the recreation supervisor or league director to be
present during the discussion to lend additional support.
Parents who use the team 
as a babysitting service
Many children’s activity-filled schedules have their parents pulling their hair
out, driving them to practices and games at all hours of the day. Driving all
over town can be exhausting work, which is why some parents may view your
practices — and sometimes even games — as a convenient babysitting service.
Single parenting plays an ever-increasing role in family life today, of course,
so Mom or Dad simply may not have the luxury of hanging out at the lacrosse
field if they have other responsibilities, such as getting another sibling to a
different practice on the other side of town. But ideally, you want parents to
be part of the practice regimen whenever possible and to be there on game
day, providing positive support and encouragement for the entire team.
After you run a handful of practices and coach a few games, you get a pretty
good sense of which parents are taking advantage of you by using you as an
unpaid babysitting service. During your interactions with the kids, begin gauging
what type of family life they have at home, and use your conversations with
parents before practices and games to get a feel for what types of people they
are. All this information can help you relate to your players more effectively.
One of the best ways to get parents to stick around for practice is to include
them in some of your drills, as we discuss in Chapter 6. When those parents
who typically don’t hang around see all the fun the other parents are having
with their children, they may start hanging around themselves, wanting to be
part of the action.
Let parents know that their presence, even during a routine practice during
the middle of the week, can do a great deal for a child’s confidence while
maintaining her interest in the sport. You can even mention a drill you’ve
310
Part V: The Extra Points 

done in practice that their child has taken a real liking to and suggest that
they work on it with her at home. Practicing at home will help the child con-
tinue to improve that particular area of her game and get her parents more
involved in her development, which is good news for everyone.
Lacrosse is a sport that many parents are not entirely familiar with, so their
roles may be a bit unclear to them. Even if you outline their responsibilities
for them at your preseason parents meeting your message may not have sunk
in or it got lost in the shuffle of practices and games. A quick, casual conver-
sation with parents when they arrive to pick their children up after practice
may be all you need to make a difference. Let them know that you think their
children could really benefit from having them take a more active interest in
their lacrosse. A child who finally gets a handle on a skill that he’s been strug-
gling to master derives a lot more satisfaction if he can glance over to the
sidelines and get a smile or a nod of approval from Mom or Dad.
Parents who question their 
child’s playing time
Some parents pay more attention to their child’s playing time than they do to
their retirement accounts, and with good reason. Parents don’t sign their
child up for lacrosse, write a check to cover the registration fee, and purchase
all sorts of equipment just to see her sitting on the bench. Unfortunately,
depending on the number of kids who have been assigned to your team, your
hands may be tied, and you must rotate players in and out of games. Based
on the size of your team, kids may get a chance to play in only half the game.
At advanced levels of play, in which skill level dictates game-day minutes, many
parents relate playing time to their own parenting skills. The more skilled their
child is at attacking or defending — and the more playing time he receives
because of those skills — the better parenting job they assume that they’re
doing. In their eyes, the child’s playing time becomes a status symbol; they
think that it reflects favorably on them as they sit in the stands with the other
parents.
Frustration with their child’s playing time is a fairly common complaint
among parents. Luckily, it’s also fairly easy to handle. Here are some points to
keep in mind:
 Lean on the program policy. Most leagues have a clear policy regarding
playing time. At beginning levels, equal playing time is important so that
everyone gets a fair chance to run around on the field and experience
different aspects of the game. Before the season starts, take time to
explain to parents how you will distribute those coveted game-day minutes
(see Chapter 4).
311
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

Some parents may still think their child deserves more minutes because
of his tremendous lacrosse skills. If you find yourself in one of these con-
versations, let the parents know that you enjoy coaching their son and
that you’d love to give him more playing time, but you have to abide by
the rules of the league, as well as be fair to all your players. After all,
rules are rules.
 Revisit your preseason chat. Offer a friendly reminder of what you
stated during your preseason meeting (covered in Chapter 4): that kids
will receive an equal amount of playing time as long as they’re regular
participants at practice. Remind parents that kids who don’t attend
practice can’t simply show up on game day and expect the same treat-
ment as those players who do attend every practice.
 Monitor the minutes. For a couple of very good reasons, you should track
the minutes your kids get on the field on game day: It’s the right way to
ensure that each child is getting her fair share, and it’s exactly the proof
you can turn to if disgruntled parents question why their child isn’t playing
as much as some of her teammates. Written documentation of the great
lengths you go to make the season fair for everyone is usually enough to
make your point. If you have assistant coaches, you can appoint one of
them to track each player’s minutes to ensure fairness. (Check out Chapter 4
for details on how to choose your assistant coaches.)
Disruptive parents
Coaching a youth lacrosse team has many wonderful aspects, and kids also
enjoy many benefits from their participation. Unfortunately, any time parents
step across the line of good behavior, their actions can smother the fun and
embarrass their child in the process. Why some parents act irresponsibly
and behave poorly while watching a youth lacrosse game is a mystery much
of the time, likely involving factors that are out of your control. What is in your
control is your ability to keep negative parental behavior from ruining your
players’ experience on the field.
Whenever a parent makes an inappropriate comment or is too demonstrative
in his actions, address the problem as soon as possible. Ignoring a misbehav-
ing parent, or being reluctant to address the situation, sends an awful mes-
sage to everyone — parents and children alike — that this type of behavior is
acceptable. Parents must know that inappropriate words and actions won’t
be tolerated in any form. Dealing with these types of problems swiftly also
lets the other team parents know that if they step (or act) out of line, you’ll
deal with them accordingly. Parents who are there to be supportive and enjoy
their children’s lacrosse experience will appreciate your commitment to
ensuring that everyone has a rewarding time and that you won’t allow inap-
propriate behavior to spoil the day.

Part V: The Extra Points 

How do you handle a parent who has just shouted an embarrassing com-
ment? What do you do when parents yell across the field at a coach who
appears to be running up the score on your team? What do you do when ten-
sions seem to be rising among parents who are unhappy with how the game
is unfolding? In the following sections, we provide some strategies to help
you deal with such situations. Because you’re only human, such disruptions
are bound to rattle you at times, so we also advise you what not to do.
What to do
Following are some approaches you can use to help keep everyone’s tempers
in check and the game moving along without any unnecessary disruptions for
the kids:
 Remind parents of the rules in a friendly tone. Quite often, parents
don’t even realize that they’ve crossed the line. You can be firm — yet
friendly — in reminding them to keep their emotions in check and their
comments to themselves. Usually, this reminder is enough to remedy the
situation.
 Be familiar with your league’s parent policy. As we discuss in Chapter 2,
knowing your league’s rules thoroughly is extremely important. Youth
lacrosse leagues around the country are instituting parent sportsmanship
programs — both voluntary and mandatory — to help give parents a
clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities.
If your league doesn’t have a sportsmanship program for parents, you
may want to recommend one to your league director. Such a program is
sure to make life easier for all the coaches in the league, encouraging
parents to work with coaches in their children’s best interests.
 Set an example of civility. You can defuse a tense situation with an upset
parent by maintaining a calm, friendly demeanor. Setting a civil tone right
from the start is a critical building block in a productive discussion.
Granted, being civil may be difficult at times, particularly when the parent
is accusing you of being the worst lacrosse coach she’s ever come across.
Take a deep breath and never allow yourself to be lured into an argument.
You’ve got to defuse tense situations rather than fuel them.
 Be prepared to listen. If you’re not willing to listen to what parents have
to say, how can you expect them to listen to you? Focus as much on
listening as on trying to get your point across, and a parent is likely to
work with you and not against you.
 Watch your (body) language. Just as your tone and body language
influence your interactions with the kids, they affect your dealings with
parents. Suppose that a parent asks you why his child got to play in only
half the game, and before responding, you put your hands on your hips.
That parent will perceive you as being upset before you even respond to
the question. Mixed body-language signals or a negative tone can set up
an unproductive, unhealthy conversation that can spiral out of control.
313
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

 Remove parents from the field only as a last resort. Having a parent
removed from the playing area is an extreme step to take. But some-
times ejection is the only way to ensure the safety and well being of 
the young participants on the field, as well as of the other spectators.
Being thrown out is certainly an embarrassment for the parent who’s being
removed, as well as for the child whose fun game of lacrosse is 
being interrupted.
Keep in mind that when parents request a meeting with you, in most cases
they are doing so out of genuine love and concern for their child’s well being,
and you should respect that concern. Make it clear to the parents that you
want the best for their child, just as they do. Listen intently to whatever con-
cerns the parents may have; then talk through the issue with them to come
up with a solution. A good idea is to end the chat on a positive note by
acknowledging the child’s attributes and pointing out what a pleasure she is
to coach.
What not to do
Sometimes, as frustration levels mount regarding specific issues, you may be
tempted to do just about anything to rid yourself of the problem. We advise
you to steer clear of the following actions:
 Fire back at the parents. Parents may agree to meet with you about
their behavior and then use the meeting as an opportunity to bombard
you with accusations and complaints about how you are running the
team. Those comments may be upsetting, but don’t turn the meeting
into a tennis match of insults, with negative words being fired back and
forth. Getting lured into this type of heated discussion accomplishes
nothing and serves no useful purpose. If the situation is unavoidable,
calmly listen to the complaints and then state your case in a reasonable
manner without antagonizing the parent in the process.
 Embarrass the parents. Parenting young lacrosse players isn’t easy, so
as the coach, you must accept the fact that some parents have difficulty
getting a grip on their emotions. When they see their child knocked down
or tripped by an opposing player, and the referee doesn’t call a penalty,
they may have difficulty keeping their displeasure to themselves. When
you hear a comment shouted from the stands, try looking over your
shoulder at the offending parent. That brief eye contact lets her know
that what she just said is unacceptable and that she needs to tone down
her behavior.
 Take out your frustration on the child. No matter how poorly parents
behave or what mean-spirited words come out of their mouths, never
take out your frustration on their child. Remember, the youngsters on
your team have no control of how their parents behave on game day, so
don’t slice their playing time or take any other drastic measures in an
314
Part V: The Extra Points 

effort to rein in the emotional outbursts. Push your feelings about the
parents to the side and continue coaching these children as enthusiasti-
cally as you do the other players.
 Have postgame discussions in the parking lot. Mature discussions typi-
cally don’t occur in the parking lot after games, when emotions often run
high. Explain to the parents that you’re happy to meet with them to discuss
any concerns they may have, but at a time that’s convenient for all of
you and in a place that’s private — not in front of their child, the rest 
of the team, and the parents of opposing players.
Perpetually late parents
Late arrivals are a real nuisance when you’ve settled into a seat at the movie
theater and are forced to stand up ten minutes later as people work their way
down the aisle in the dark to find some seats, jostling your popcorn and soda
in the process. Late arrivals are just as aggravating when you’re trying to run
a lacrosse practice. When kids appear midway through a practice, the entire
flow of the session is thrown off, and a player who shows up in the middle of
a game can create chaos with your substitution patterns.
Besides the inconvenience factor, keep in mind that kids who arrive late have
missed the valuable prepractice or pregame warm-up (see Chapter 17 for
more information) and will be at increased risk of injury if you send them out
onto the field right away.
Late arrivals must be addressed as soon as they occur, because if you let them
go and allow them to continue, the consequences can be even more problem-
atic. If you have a few kids who aren’t on time for a game, for example, and you
don’t have enough players to put on the field, you may be forced to forfeit.
Talking to tardy players
Following are a few tips that you can use to help get the kids to your practices
and games on time:
 Talk to the team as a whole. As soon as late arrivals are beginning to
create problems, talk to the entire team to reinforce your expectations
on attendance. Make the chat a quick one, but stress that being part of a
team is a commitment — one that needs to be kept at midweek practices
and championship games alike. Make it clear that you’re at the field on
time for all practices and games, and that you expect and deserve the
same consideration from every one of your players.
315
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

 Make roll call a big deal. Even though you can easily see which kids are
at the practice, employ a fun roll call during the team’s warm-up. You
can call out funny nicknames for players, for example, or use an amusing
voice that gets a chuckle from the kids. Even if you have only a dozen
kids on your team, and a roll call isn’t necessary from the standpoint of
knowing who’s there and who hasn’t arrived yet, roll call can still be a
fun moment that the kids enjoy being part of and won’t want to miss.
 Play fun games before practice. If you throw in fun little games before
practice begins, you may be pleasantly surprised by the number of kids
who suddenly show up at practice well ahead of time. Ideally, they’re
pestering their parents to get them to practice early so that they don’t
miss out on this activity with their teammates.
 Award equal playing time for on-time arrival. Game-day minutes are
valuable, so you should hand them out equally to players who are
consistently on time for practices and who participate in the entire
session. For players who are continually late, you should cut playing
time accordingly. Giving equal playing time to a child who always turns
up late simply isn’t fair to his teammates who show up on time week
after week.
What makes this issue tricky is that a child may have to rely on her parents
to get her to the practice on time. As we discuss in Chapter 4, you should
address the importance of showing up on time at your preseason parents’
meeting. Explain how crucial punctuality is, both for the season to run
smoothly and for the children to learn and develop skills (not to mention for
your sanity!).
Talking to tardy parents
Any time you speak to a child about lateness, be sure to follow up with his
parent. Keeping the parents in the loop reinforces how important being on
time is to you. Many parents simply don’t realize what a big disruption their
child’s lateness causes for the rest of the team. Ideally, a brief conversation
reminding parents of the importance of having everyone at the field on time
is all you need to prevent the problem from occurring during the remainder
of the season.
Following are a few things you may want to mention to parents to ensure that
the discussion goes smoothly and that all parties are happy at the conclusion:
 Lateness is a nuisance for the entire team. Explain to parents that late
arrivals are a disruption for the entire team. Stress that you really need
the child to be on time at every practice, for both the team’s sake and
his own development. The more practice time he misses, the fewer touches
he gets with the ball. Over the course of the season, getting less practice
316
Part V: The Extra Points 

will affect several areas of his game, including moving with the ball,
passing to teammates, and shooting. It also makes building a cohesive
unit more difficult, because his teammates aren’t getting as many
repetitions working with him.
 Toss out some possible solutions. Work with the parents to find a solution,
which could be as simple as having a teammate’s parent who lives nearby
pick up the youngster and bring her to practice. (Check with the other
parent before mentioning this possible alternative, of course.)
 Practice attendance translates to playing time. Remind parents that
playing time in games is distributed based on practice attendance and
that you’d hate to see their child penalized, but you have to be fair to
the kids who are on time.
 Timely attendance builds skills. Because each of your practices builds
on what you covered in the previous sessions, kids who are late miss 
out on valuable minutes. When a child is late and misses your instructions
or a drill that emphasizes what you’ve addressed, his development is
compromised, and his practice in that particular skill is limited.
Handling Problem Coaches
Volunteer lacrosse coaches show up at the field with all sorts of backgrounds
and experiences with the sport. You will meet a lot of great people who care
deeply about kids and want to ensure that all the players on the field have a
fun and rewarding experience. Unfortunately, you may also encounter those
who just don’t get it when it comes to kids and lacrosse. Although you’re
more likely to see rude, out-of-control, and offensive behavior among coaches
in the older age groups, it also happens at the beginning levels when games
become competitive.
The following sections look at some of the most common problems you may
encounter with coaches — both opposing coaches and those on your own
sideline.
Opposing coaches who 
encourage unsafe play
Protecting your players and ensuring that both teams use only safe tech-
niques on game days should be your top concern. Sure, in a contact sport
like lacrosse, injuries happen. You can’t always avoid the normal bumps and
317
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

bruises that occur during the course of a season, particularly if you are
coaching in a boys’ league that allows checking. But if you find your team
going against a squad that’s being encouraged to use unsafe methods that
put your players’ well being at risk, you have to take immediate action. Here
are some steps you should take:
 Speak with the officials. Any time you have a concern about inappropriate
play on the field, speak with the referee, expressing concern that your
players are being put at unnecessary risk. Be clear that you’re concerned
about the welfare of all the kids, not about how she’s calling the game.
Never be reluctant to bring up any issue that directly affects player
safety. One of the referee’s most important responsibilities is to protect
the players, so by working with her — not against her — you can help
ensure a safe day on the lacrosse field for all the youngsters.
 Never confront the opposing coaches directly. Use the referee as your
intermediary to resolve the situation. Heading over to confront the
opposing coach will just escalate the problems and cause more conflict.
A direct confrontation could also antagonize the coach, who may feel
that you’ve put his coaching techniques in question in front of all the fans.
He may view your action as a ploy to affect his team’s play, particularly
if he’s winning the game.
 Put a halt to the game. If the rough play doesn’t cease after you’ve
explained your concerns to the referee, and the kids’ safety continues to
be in jeopardy, your only recourse is to remove your team from the field.
We hope you never encounter this situation, and in all likelihood, you
never will. But if you do, keep in mind that finishing a lacrosse game
simply to get it in the books, at the risk of injury to a child, is never
worth it.
 Meet with the league director. If a league director monitors games at
the facility where your team plays and is on the premises, speak with
her about your concerns before pulling your players off the field. If she’s
not available, meet with her as soon as possible to explain your concerns
about the game and why you felt that terminating the contest was in the
best interest of your team.
Opposing coaches who display 
poor sportsmanship
It would be great for all the players in the league if every coach were a model
of good behavior who shared only positive comments and instructions with
his team. If you’re lucky, you’ll find yourself in that type of league, but the
318
Part V: The Extra Points 

reality is that you’ll find an occasional coach pacing up and down the side-
line, wearing out his lungs, and screaming at players to run faster and defend
better. These coaches may shower negative comments on referees and dis-
pute any call that doesn’t favor their team.
What’s the best way to handle opposing coaches who are sabotaging the
experience for everyone involved? Here are a few tips to keep in mind when
the game heats up:
 Keep a level head. Opposing coaches who display unsportsmanlike
behavior challenge your patience, test your poise, and can really get
under your skin. You have to discover for yourself what works — and
stick to it, no matter how discouraging the situation gets — for remaining
a constant model of good behavior for your team. Your solution may be
as simple as taking a deep breath and counting to 10; or turning your
back and talking to your players on the bench. Find what works for you.
 Use the situation as a teaching moment. Point out to your team members
the type of boorish behavior that’s taking place on the other sideline.
Remind them that they have to rise above that type of conduct, and
demonstrate that they can be much better behaved.
 Meet with the league director. Make her aware which coach is setting a
poor example for the kids, and outline the behavior that is disrupting
the experience for everyone else.
 Gather your team for a chat. When the opposing coach is causing
distractions with his behavior, get your kids together, and tell them to
ignore the shouting and to focus on playing their own game. Keep talking
to them in a positive manner; keep their attention focused on the game
and on using their skills. Don’t allow their attention to wander to the
opposing coach’s obnoxious behavior.
Dissenting assistants on your team
Assistant coaches play important roles on your team. They’re extra sets of
eyes and ears during games, and they can help provide instruction and keep
drills moving during practices. But as I discuss in Chapter 4, exercising great
caution in selecting people for these key positions is extremely important.
What are some of the problems that you can run into with your assistant
coaches? You may have an assistant who:
319
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

 Wants his child to receive more playing time: This person may have
had ulterior motives from the start and volunteered to help you out
simply as a way to get her child on the field more often or to play a spe-
cific position she had her eye on for her daughter. At the first sign of
trouble have a private chat with the assistant and let her know that in
order to continue in her role she’ll have to abide by your rules and keep
her focus on helping all of the kids.
 Causes distractions during games: Even the most laid-back, mild-
mannered parents can evolve into sideline screamers as soon as the
game begins. This type of behavior detracts from the kids’ enjoyment
and interferes with your coaching. Swift action is a must in these situa-
tions so that the assistant’s behavior doesn’t disrupt the entire game.
Talk to them right away to rein in their emotional outbursts.
 Isn’t an effective teacher of skills: You can’t afford to have assistants
who can’t reinforce the proper way to perform a skill. Also, having
unqualified assistants isn’t fair to the kids. Even worse, assistants who
teach kids unsafe techniques can create unnecessary risk of injury —
not only to your players, but also to opposing players. You may have
some great, well-meaning parents who raised their hands and volun-
teered to help you out, but if their knowledge of lacrosse is limited, or if
they’re unable to pick up from you how to teach and work with kids in a
positive manner, all sorts of problems could occur. You can release the
parent from his duties; or if he genuinely wants to help kids work with
him on the proper way to teach skills so that he can make a positive
impact during your practices.
 Reveals a coaching philosophy that is opposite of yours: During your
preseason meeting with the parents (see Chapter 4), you should stress
that winning is going to take a back seat to skill development, safety, and
fun. Although all the parents may have nodded in agreement with your
words back then, you may discover after the games begin that the par-
ents who are now your assistants no longer share those views. Basically,
they go against everything you want to stress to the kids and undermine
the positive impact you are trying to make on each youngster. Have a
chat with the assistant and give him a refresher on your philosophy and
how you want him interacting with the players. If this discussion doesn’t
alleviate the problem, thank him for his time and relieve him of his duties.
Your assistant coaches are an extension of you — which makes everything
they say and do on your behalf extremely important to the overall success of
the season. Especially during your first few practices of the season, monitor
them closely to see how they interact with the kids, oversee drills, and teach
skills.
320
Part V: The Extra Points 

If an assistant isn’t getting the job done or isn’t adhering to the philosophies
you’re looking to instill in your team, you need to have a one-on-one talk with
him right away to reinforce what you want to accomplish this season.
Usually, this chat is enough to get the assistant back on the right track. If
problems continue, let him know that you think it’s in the best interest of the
team for him to step down from his assistant duties. The position is simply
too important for you to let a problem linger any longer than necessary,
because it will detract from the kids’ lacrosse experience. Be sure to thank
the assistant for his time and effort, and encourage him to continue being a
part of his child’s season as a positive sideline supporter.
Dealing with Discipline Problems 
on Your Own Team
Teaching kids cradling, attacking, shooting, and defending are just some of
the many aspects of lacrosse that test your coaching skills. Making sure that
youngsters listen to your instructions, respect your authority, and abide by
the team rules you set forth can pose a whole new set of challenges that you
may not have been completely aware of — or prepared for — when you
stepped forward to volunteer this season.
Because you’re likely to be dealing with at least a dozen kids, chances are
that at some point during the season, you’ll have to discipline a child who
steps over the line. Don’t jump to the conclusion that children misbehave
simply as a means to cause trouble. Sometimes, children act out in a disrup-
tive manner because they’re frustrated by their lack of progress, they feel
that their contributions are going unnoticed, or they don’t feel that they’re
really part of the team.
Giving players three strikes
You can rely on the three-strikes technique when dealing with discipline
problems among your players. This method is effective because it gives the
children a little room for error and gives you the chance to restructure their
behavior.
Be sure to inform the parents of the procedure you will be following before
any problems materialize so that everyone fully understands how punish-
ment will be handed out.
Here’s how the three-strikes technique works.
321
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

Strike one
The first time one of your players displays unacceptable behavior, issue a
verbal warning. Let her know that you’re not pleased with what she said or
did, and that if she says or does it again, you’ll hand out punishment.
Behavior that merits a strike-one warning includes swearing during a game or
displaying unsportsmanlike conduct, such as refusing to shake the hand of an
opposing player following a game. In most cases, when a child knows that a
stricter measure will be enforced if she repeats the behavior, she isn’t likely
to do it again.
You’re dealing with all different types of kids, of course, and for whatever rea-
sons, some of them may ignore your warning or simply may not take it seri-
ously. So be aware that your first warning may not produce the desired effect.
Be willing to go to the next discipline level so that players don’t trample your
authority.
Strike two
If a player continues to disobey your instructions — if he’s still swearing
during games, for example — you have to go beyond the strike-one verbal
warning to resolve the problem before it becomes an even bigger distraction
to the team. Stepping up the punishment, such as taking away a portion of
his playing time in the next game, sends a clear message that he has no room
for negotiation and that if he doesn’t stop this behavior immediately, he’s not
going to get back on the field. Let the player know in clear and specific terms
that if he misbehaves again, he will jeopardize his future with the team.
After a strike-two warning, meet with the parents, and let them know what
took place with their child. Explain to them that you want their child to be
part of this team and that he won’t have to face repercussions the rest of the
season if he starts behaving in an appropriate manner. Relay exactly what
you said to the child so that the parents can follow through at home. This
reinforcement makes the child aware of the seriousness of his behavior and
the need to take immediate action so he can continue playing on the team.
Let the parents know that their child will be sitting on the bench for an
extended period as punishment for his behavior. If you happen to be coaching
in a more competitive league, and the offending child is a starter, not allowing
him to start is usually all you need to do to turn his behavior around.
Strike three
Most players steer clear of this unpleasant territory. In this three-tiered
approach to passing out punishment, with coveted playing time at stake,
most youngsters behave after the first or second verbal warning. But in the
rare event that a child continues to behave in an unacceptable fashion, you
322
Part V: The Extra Points 

may have no choice but to remove her from the team. You have a responsibility
to all the players and can’t allow one child’s behavior to disrupt the experience
for everyone else.
Ideally, you never want to be in a position to force a child away from lacrosse.
Before you resort to this measure, a good idea is to meet with the league
director to explain what has happened so far.
If the child does end up being kicked off the team, you can go so far as to
allow her to return if she’s willing to apologize to you and the team, and
promises to be a model of good behavior from then on. Kids can turn over a
new leaf. Maybe a few days away from the team will make her realize how
much she misses playing lacrosse. When she knows that the door is cracked
open for her return if she apologizes for her indiscretions, the potential exists
for everything to work out in the end.
Trying other techniques
Following are a few other tips for handling behavior problems among your
players:
 Avoid using laps as punishment. When a child disobeys your orders,
you may be tempted to send him on a lap around the field as punishment,
but refrain from going that route. Conditioning drills should never be
used as a form of punishment. Because conditioning plays a very impor-
tant role in lacrosse, especially at the more advanced levels of play, you
don’t want children associating conditioning and running with punish-
ment. You want them to have a positive outlook on conditioning — not a
negative one that can slow their development and take away some of
their effectiveness.
 Stick to your word. When you outline your team rules, and describe the
discipline that you’ll deliver for breaking them, be sure to follow through
whenever disciplinary action is warranted. Backing up your talk with
action maintains your authority and respect with the team. You don’t
want to lose credibility, or your players’ trust or respect, by failing to
follow through when a team violation occurs.
 Enforce the rules evenly. One of the most disastrous moves you can
make in disciplining children is playing favorites, allowing some kids to
get away with certain behavior while punishing others for the same
infraction. A youngster’s ability to shoot the ball more accurately than
her teammates or defend better doesn’t mean that you should create
another level of rules for her. Doing so divides the team and causes
resentment among players, which is a surefire way to destroy team unity.
323
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

 Apply punishment fairly. Your job is to coach lacrosse, not to dole out
punishment at every turn. Keep a level perspective while enforcing team
policies. If a child forgets his water bottle at practice, don’t view that
infraction as being equal to swearing during a practice or game. During
the course of a season, minor lapses are going to occur; don’t go out of
your way to turn them into major problems.
 Ditch the doghouse. When a misbehaving child’s discipline is completed,
both you and she have to push the problem to the side and move
forward. Clinging to animosity or ill feelings won’t do either of you any
good. Show the child that you are willing to forget her past behavior by
treating her exactly as you have all season. Keeping a child in the dog-
house simply isn’t fair when you’ve already punished her for her trans-
gression. Instead, focus on making sure that she feels like a valued
member of the team again. Recognize her when she does something
well, which will help reassure her that the past problems have been
forgotten.
 Control your emotions. Shouting or losing your temper distorts the
discipline you’re trying to enforce and set a poor example for the team.
 Never discipline players for mistakes on the field. Disciplining a child
for an error on the field is never appropriate, even if it results in a winning
goal for the opposition in the final seconds of a tied game. Breakdowns
on defense, turnovers, and errant passes are always going to occur and
should never result in any type of punishment.
On the other hand, if a player intentionally tries to injure an opponent or
teammate — by tripping him, for example — immediately remove that
player from the game. This type of behavior may warrant further disci-
plinary action on your part, depending on the severity of the action, the
intent, and other factors that led up to the tripping incident.
The nonlistener
No matter how interesting your instructions, or how much great information
you have to share with the kids, some are going to pay little attention to what
you have to say about how to play the game. Some may think they already
know how to perform all the skills, and others may just have no interest in
learning from you and will tune you out and do their own thing. This inatten-
tiveness can be especially troublesome if they employ techniques that,
despite your continued instruction on how to perform them the right way,
pose injury risks for other players.
324
Part V: The Extra Points 

If you see that a child isn’t listening to your instructions, sit him down in
practice and have him watch how the rest of the team follows your directions.
After a few minutes, ask him whether he’s ready to return to play and listen to
what you have to say. Your nonlistener is likely to be much more receptive 
to your instructions after spending any length of time by your side while his
teammates are on the field.
If the child isn’t performing a skill correctly, and you suspect that she wasn’t
paying attention, ask the child why she isn’t doing it like you demonstrated.
Maybe she didn’t understand your instructions and out of frustration tried
doing it the way she thinks it should be done.
Playing time is as valuable to you as a hand full of aces is to a poker player.
When dealing with problems with your players taking away playing time — or
just the mere threat of it — is a great equalizer for a lot of problems. It also
has the power to change attitudes and improve attention spans. No one enjoys
having his fanny stuck on the bench while his friends and teammates are out
on the field during Game Day. Taking away playing time from a child who
misbehaves is no different than a parent taking away TV, computer games, 
or treats from a child at home who misbehaves.
The nonstop talker
You may find that some kids on your team talk more than a radio deejay, and
that can cause some problems from time to time. When you have players on
the team who are more interested in talking than listening to what you have
to say it can create a lot of unwanted distractions. This is particularly true if
the team is only hearing bits and pieces of your instructions, because your
effectiveness as a coach is being compromised, along with the development
of the rest of your squad. Read on to see which techniques work best for
curbing the vocal cords of those kids whose mouths seem to run non-stop.
As soon as you get a sense that too much talking is going on, toss out a
reminder to the team that when you’re speaking all the team members must
remain quiet so that everyone can hear what you are saying. If that fails and
the talking continues, you may have to call the player out in front of everyone.
For example, say something like “Evan, please don’t talk while I’m addressing
the team. It’s important that everyone hears what I’m going over. If you have a
comment or question, please hold it until I’m done or raise your hand.”
325
Chapter 18: Challenges Every Lacrosse Coach Will Face

Either of those approaches usually quiets the problem, but if you continue 
to experience disruptions, it’s time for a one-on-one chat. Pull the player aside 
and be firm in your stance that he must abide by your rules or face the
consequences — and then spell those rules out clearly so he knows the penalties
for any continued misbehavior. If you have to reprimand him again to be quiet,
let him know that he’s going to lose significant amounts of playing time. Usually
this threat is enough to get his attention — and close his mouth.
Any time you have a personal chat with a youngster regarding his behavior,
and what the results will be if it continues in a negative fashion, be sure to
alert his parents, as well. Keeping Mom and Dad updated on what is going on
helps prevent further problems down the road if you are forced to discipline
the child.

Failures to communicate: Coaching kids 
who don’t (or won’t) listen
No matter how interesting your instructions are
or how much great information you have to
share, some kids pay little attention to what you
have to say. Some think they already know how
to perform all the skills; others have no interest
in learning from you, so they tune you out and
do their own thing. Here are some tips on
coping with inattentive players:
 If you see that a child isn’t listening to your
instructions, sit him down during practice,
and have him watch how the rest of the
team follows your directions. After a few
minutes, ask him whether he’s ready to
return to play and listen to what you have to
say. Your nonlistener is likely to be much
more receptive to your instructions after
spending any length of time by your side
while his teammates are on the field.
 If the child isn’t performing a skill correctly,
and you suspect that she wasn’t paying
attention, ask the child why she isn’t doing
it the way you demonstrated. Maybe she
didn’t understand your instructions and, out
of frustration, tried performing the skill the
way she thought it should be done.
 As soon as you get a sense that too much
talking is going on, remind the players that
when you’re speaking, they must remain
quiet so that everyone can hear what you
are saying. If that reminder fails, and the
talking continues, you may have to call a
player out in front of everyone. Say some-
thing like this: “Evan, please don’t talk while
I’m addressing the team. It’s important that
everyone hears what I’m going over. If you
have a comment or question, please hold it
until I’m done or raise your hand.”
 If you continue to experience disruptions, pull
the player aside for a one-on-one chat. Be
firm in your stance that she must abide by
your rules or face the consequences — and
then spell those rules out clearly so that she
knows the penalties for continued misbehav-
ior. Let her know that she’s going to lose sig-
nificant amounts of playing time if you have
to reprimand her again. Usually, this threat is
enough to get a child’s attention — and close
her mouth.

M
any kids love the challenge of developing new lacrosse skills and, as
they progress, putting those skills to use in more-competitive programs.
The same goes for some coaches, who crave teaching advanced strategies
and techniques to players in highly competitive environments. At this point,
coaching travel teams enters the picture.
If you think you’re ready to take over a travel lacrosse team, this chapter is
for you. Here, you find everything you need to know to make your transition
to the travel-team sideline a smoother one. You get details on the do’s and
don’ts of running a tryout, tips for putting together your team, insight on
dealing with problems that can arise on the road, and pointers for making the
season a rewarding one.
Getting Familiar with Travel Teams
The travel-team environment is vastly different from what you may have been
used to in local recreation programs. The games tend to be highly competitive,
and your team will be facing opponents from different communities — in some
cases, even from different states. As long as you maintain your focus on
providing for the best interests of all the kids, the travel-team experience 
can be richly rewarding for everyone involved.
Travel teams are good opportunities for youngsters who are interested in
focusing on lacrosse as their main sport and who want to play against top-
level competition on a regular basis. These teams give kids the chance to
play in highly competitive tournaments against other talented teams. They
also require a much greater time commitment from both players and parents
than recreational lacrosse programs do.

328
Part V: The Extra Points 
A typical week on a travel team usually involves several practices, and week-
ends are often swallowed up by traveling and competing in tournaments.
Seasons typically run much longer than in recreational programs and usually
entail a larger financial commitment from parents to cover all the costs asso-
ciated with travel.
Generally speaking, travel teams are best for older kids with advanced skills.
Because of the increased level of play, the added pressure that typically
accompanies these teams, and the fuller schedule of practices and games,
most experts say that kids younger than 12 should not be involved with
travel teams. Instead, they should be introduced to a variety of sports and
activities that allow them to develop a wide range of skills — including bal-
ance, coordination, and agility — before specializing in one sport.
This guideline is a general one, of course. Children mature at vastly different
rates, both emotionally and physically, and some 11-year-olds may be better
equipped to handle the travel-team experience than a 13-year-old would be.
Assembling Your Travel Team
Coaching youth lacrosse can be challenging, and taking the reins of a travel
team presents even more situations that will test your coaching prowess.
Besides running tryouts and analyzing players’ abilities, you have the
unpleasant task of breaking the bad news to those players who didn’t make
the team. In this section, we explore how to handle all these areas.
Planning the tryout
Orchestrating a well-run lacrosse tryout speaks volumes about your coaching
ability and makes choosing the players much easier. The following pointers
can help you plan your tryout efficiently so that you can select the players
who most deserve to play on the team.
Limit the tryout to 1 hour for kids ages 12 and younger. For older kids, you can
bump it up to 11⁄2 to 2 hours. If you need to hold a couple of sessions to evaluate
all the kids effectively, that’s fine. You’re much better off holding a pair of 1-hour
sessions than a single 2-hour session.
Start on a positive note
Take a couple of minutes at the start of the tryout to introduce yourself and
outline how you plan to run the session. Letting players know ahead of time
what is in store for them will ease their stress and eliminate surprises along

the way. Also, it allows them to focus on performing to the best of their ability —
which is good news for you, because you’ll get an accurate gauge of their
skills and talent level.
Warm up the players
You must keep the safety and well being of the players in mind at all times,
which means approaching the tryout the same way you would a regular
practice with your team. Begin by having the players go through a proper
warm-up. (For more on warming up, see Chapter 17.) If you rely on the players
to warm up on their own, some of them may not do a very effective job,
thereby opening the door to unwanted injuries.
Avoid choosing players to lead the stretches. Even if you’re familiar with
some of the players and know that they’d do a great job leading the warm-
ups, that tactic sends the wrong message to everyone else. The other kids
may think that you’re already playing favorites and that these kids are tapped
for positions on the team before they even try out.
Provide a few pointers
You don’t want to get too caught up in coaching, simply because that takes away
from the purpose of the tryout: evaluating the players’ skills. But sprinkling your
tryout with some coaching pointers isn’t a bad idea. After all, providing some
coaching tips will give you a chance to observe how the kids react to instruction,
feedback, and even constructive criticism. You’ll be coaching some of these
players for several months, so it’s helpful to gain some insight into how
receptive they are to your feedback.
Make drills gamelike
Running timed sprints down the field isn’t a good evaluation tool; neither is
determining how quickly a youngster can maneuver with the ball through a
series of cones. If one player completes the course in 22 seconds, and another
youngster takes 20 seconds, what have you really learned about the talent
level of these two individuals? Not a whole lot, especially if the player who ran
through the cones faster had his head down the entire time — a tactic that
won’t bode well when he’s on the field in a game and needs to know where his
teammates are, as well as any defenders who are converging on him.
The best way to assess talent and determine whether players are ready for
competition at the travel-team level is to put them in situations that closely
mirror game conditions. That way, you see how they respond to pressure and
what types of decisions they make while playing both offense and defense.
329
Chapter 19: Coaching a Lacrosse Travel Team

Maximize the action
Observing players in small-sided games — two-on-two or three-on-three —
provides a wealth of information on their abilities. Putting them in situations
that allow them plenty of touches of the ball will help you determine how
they make the transition from offense to defense, how they recognize various
situations, and how they plan to move and defend. Taking in all this informa-
tion and noticing these tendencies are vital for getting a true evaluation of a
youngster’s abilities in lacrosse.
This information will also be extremely valuable for the players you do end
up choosing, because you can use it to help determine which positions they
are best suited for.
Limit the stations
If you elect to use several stations during your tryout — such as a shooting
station to evaluate a goalie’s performance and other players’ shooting skills —
limit the number of stations you have going at the same time. (A station is
simply an area of the field that is devoted to a specific skill that the players
work on during practice.) Having too many stations running simultaneously
prevents you from monitoring all the players effectively. The more assistants
that you have helping out, the more stations you can run. If you’ve only got
one assistant, it does little good to have half a dozen stations running at one
time because it’s impossible to monitor all the kids and how they are per-
forming skills.
Also, if some kids see that you are not at their station watching them, they
(understandably) may not be quite as focused on giving their best effort,
which detracts from the effectiveness of the entire tryout process.
Thank the players and parents
At the conclusion of the tryout, be sure to thank the players for following
instructions and doing their best. Also thank the parents for their willingness
to get the kids to the field on time and for adjusting their busy schedules to
accommodate the tryout. Saying “Thank you” is a nice touch that further
demonstrates how much you truly care.
Selecting players
Planning a well-structured tryout is the first step in putting together your
travel team. Now, while the kids are running, passing, defending, giving it
their all, and collecting grass stains, you’ve got to keep close tabs on all of
them to determine which ones deserve the chance to play for you this season.
330
Part V: The Extra Points 

Evaluating skills is important, but be sure that you and your assistants take a
look at these sometimes-overlooked areas during the selection process:
 Teamwork: Assessing how players work with their teammates is crucial.
A great passer is an asset to the team if she looks for open teammates;
she’s a major liability if she’s reluctant to give up possession of the ball.
A highly skilled player must be a team player to fit into the framework of
your squad.
 Demeanor: Does the player get noticeably upset when a teammate fails
to deliver an accurate pass to him that could have resulted in a scoring
opportunity? Does he get visibly frustrated when his pass isn’t handled
efficiently and the opposing team gains possession of the ball? You want
players who are supportive, rather than negative, toward their teammates.
 Competitive spirit: Don’t neglect the mental aspect. Keep a close watch
on each player to see what type of competitor she is. When she loses
the ball to a defender, does she focus on regaining possession, or does
she tend to become frustrated and pout? Is she a good sport who plays
within the rules, or does she resort to unfavorable tactics at times?
These traits aren’t automatic qualifiers or disqualifiers, because you have to
evaluate each child individually. But if you elect to choose a child who
behaved inappropriately at times during the tryout, you are responsible for
working with that youngster and teaching him the importance of behaving in
a respectful manner.
Having extra sets of eyes overseeing the tryout can be a big help, particularly
if you have a large turnout. If you have several adults helping you, make sure
that they get a chance to see all the kids perform; otherwise, their evalua-
tions won’t be as accurate and comprehensive as they could be. To make the
process more effective, make a list of the skills you want your evaluators to
monitor, such as speed, quickness, shooting, passing, receiving, and defending.
If you’re taking the place of a coach who handled the team last season, ask
her advice, because she has valuable information about the types of kids who
play and compete best at this level.
Breaking the good — and bad — 
news to players
Informing a child that he made the team and seeing that smile on his face are
great perks of coaching a travel lacrosse team. Unfortunately, those perks are
balanced by the need to give bad news to the kids who didn’t make the team.
You and the players alike will experience a wide range of emotions when it
comes to this part of the travel-team process. You’ll have happiness and
heartbreak, smiles and sadness, and deliriousness and disappointment.
331
Chapter 19: Coaching a Lacrosse Travel Team

Here are some do’s and don’ts when it comes to informing kids whether they
will be wearing a travel-team jersey for you this season:
 Don’t drag the process out. Make your decisions in a timely manner.
Think about going on an interview for a job you really coveted and how
nerve-wracking it was, waiting to hear whether you got the position. The
kids who try out for your lacrosse team feel the same way. Naturally, they’re
going to be anxious to hear whether they made the cut, so be as prompt
as possible in your decision-making process.
 Notify everyone. Sure, your life would be much easier if all you had to
do was deliver the good news to the kids who made the team. But in fair-
ness to all the youngsters who sweated and poured out their hearts in
every drill you put them through, you’ve got to personally let every
player know whether or not she made the team.
 Discuss your playing-time policy. When informing kids that they made the
team, be sure to clearly explain to them (and their parents) that playing
time during the season will be determined by ability. Some parents may
be under the impression that because they’re taking on additional costs,
their child will be starting every game. Make sure that everyone understands
that travel teams are vastly different from recreational leagues, and that
although all players will receive plenty of work in practice, playing time in
games will be handed out to those who possess the most skills and who
can put the team in position to perform at its best.
 Break bad news gently. Yes, a child will be disappointed when she finds
out that she didn’t make the team. But what you say — and how you say
it — can determine how long that disappointment lingers and whether
she uses it as motivation to work on her skills. (See the nearby sidebar,
“Cushioning the blow of bad news.”)
332
Part V: The Extra Points 
Cushioning the blow of bad news
Telling a child that he didn’t make the team is
like telling him that he won’t have any presents
to open on his birthday. This news can crush a
child’s confidence and self-esteem, and you’ve
got to do everything you can to soften the blow
of this setback. You don’t want it to squash a
player’s enthusiasm for the sport or derail his
interest in playing.
Make it clear that your choice is not a judgment
of the child as a person. Let the youngster and
his parents know what areas of his game you
were impressed with, as well as the areas that
he should do a little more work on. A good idea
is to offer specific suggestions on how he can
improve the weaker areas of his game.
Also make sure that you encourage him to try
out again next season. He simply may need one
more season of recreational play to hone his
skills before he makes the jump to this more-
competitive level of play. You don’t want the
child to regret that he tried out.

Handling Problems away from Home
Coaching a travel lacrosse team involves much more than just figuring out
who should handle the offensive and defensive roles or who should start in
goal in the upcoming weekend tournament. Several issues often arise away
from the field, and you must deal with all of them, because they directly
affect everyone’s experience. This section takes a look at some of the most
common problems that pop up on the road.
Safety issues
Being in charge of a large group of youngsters for an out-of-town tournament
that requires an overnight stay is an enormous responsibility. Just think about
it: You’ve got to ensure the safety of every child on the lacrosse field, on the
road to and from the event, and at the location where the team is staying
overnight. You’re going to be accountable at all times. You’re also a chaperone,
so you need to monitor and know the whereabouts of all your players all the
time. Keep the following tips in mind to ensure all the kids’ safety:
 Pair ’em up: Partner the kids up and make sure they understand they
are responsible for knowing the whereabouts of their partner at all times
during the trip.
 Make carpool assignments: By making specific assignments of who is
driving which kids you’ll have written documentation of where the kids
are at all times.
 Enforce curfews: It’s simply not safe to have kids roaming around the
motel without adult supervision, so set reasonable curfews based on
their ages and hold them to it. Make it clear that any players who break
curfew will not be allowed to play in the upcoming game.
Behavior issues
What unfolds on the field is certainly a major responsibility of yours, but
what takes place away from it should also have your full attention. When you
take a team of kids (and parents) to a weekend tournament, certain issues
have the potential to crop up at some point, including the following.
Curfews
Children naturally enjoy staying in motels and swimming in the pool, but if
they’re going to perform at their best on the field, you must enforce curfews.
The ages of the players and the starting time of their game the following day
should dictate the time of the curfew.
333
Chapter 19: Coaching a Lacrosse Travel Team

Let both the kids and their parents know in advance what time the curfew
will be. This notice helps eliminate the chance that misunderstandings will
occur.
Excessive parental partying
For many busy families these days, weekend lacrosse tournaments are the
only vacations they have time for, so parents want to enjoy themselves.
That’s perfectly fine as long as their good times don’t escalate into problems,
such as excessive drinking or noise in the motel during the evening.
Before departing for any tournament that will require an overnight stay, let
the parents know that you want them to have a good time and enjoy them-
selves, but remind them that the tournament is a youth lacrosse event.
Parents need to model good behavior and set a good example at all times.
If partying parents pose a problem, the following are some pointers to keep 
in mind:
 Address it right away. You don’t want situations to escalate out of control,
or carry over from one night to the next if it’s an extended stay for your
team. The quicker you act, the sooner the problem can be resolved.
 Offer reminders. Take time to remind the parents that this is a youth
sports event and to act accordingly. Parents may not have realized they
were behaving inappropriately, and your reminder is often all it takes to
put things in perspective.
Extracurricular activities
Competing in tournaments in different locations provides opportunities for
sightseeing and for participating in activities away from the lacrosse field.
But the last thing you want is for your players to be so exhausted from sight-
seeing that they can’t give you their best efforts.
Before departing for the event, go over the tournament schedule with the
players and their parents, and let them know well in advance whether they’ll
have any time for extracurricular activities. Clearly, if the team happens to be
playing four games in a two-day period, parents won’t be able to arrange
extra activities for their kids.
If your team gets a break in the tournament schedule, you need to decide
whether you want to organize a team activity or to allow the parents and kids
to do their own things.
334
Part V: The Extra Points 

Keep in mind the added expense of extra activities; you don’t want to put a
financial strain on some parents or force them to participate in events that
they may not be able to afford. You also don’t want one child to be left out of
an activity if the rest of the team is going. Spending an off day at a nearby
amusement park, for example, isn’t a great idea if ticket prices are out of
range for some parents.
Enjoying the Season
Sometimes, youngsters need a little time to adjust to the travel-team sched-
ule. After all, they have more practices and games to play in during the week
than they’re accustomed to; they have suitcases to pack and new locales to
play in for out-of-town tournaments; and they have increased competition for
playing time, because some of their teammates are bigger, stronger, and more
skilled in some areas of the game than they are.
The following sections cover how you can help ensure that your players
aren’t overwhelmed by the experience and that they have a memorable
lacrosse experience — for all the right reasons.
Warding off burnout
Some lacrosse travel-team seasons can stretch on for several months, which
increases the chance that players will suffer burnout. Burnout typically
involves a combination of physical and emotional exhaustion. Even though
kids love playing lacrosse, if they are subjected to a heavier practice sched-
ule than they are accustomed to, as well as an increased number of games,
they are susceptible to burnout.
Here are some tips to keep your team energized and avoid being tripped 
up by burnout:
 Rely on variety. With the extra practice load, providing kids a wide
range of drills throughout the week is more important than ever. The
more variety you spice up your practices with, the less likely your players
are to become drained from participating.
 Emphasize fun. Pressure to win can be a heavy burden on a team; even-
tually, it can sap your kids’ energy and cripple their enthusiasm. You
want your players to do their best to win games, of course, but you
don’t want them to forget to have fun. Remind them that lacrosse is a
fun sport to play and that you want them to enjoy their participation.
Make it clear to them that doing their best, and having fun doing so, out-
weighs winning.
335
Chapter 19: Coaching a Lacrosse Travel Team

 Modify the practice schedule. If your team has a heavy tournament
schedule on the horizon or will be playing several games in a short time
span, ease back on the practice schedule leading up to those games. This
cutback will help keep the kids’ energy and enthusiasm at optimum levels.
Cutting back on practice can also help prevent problems, because after
burnout settles in, the only real solution is plenty of rest and time away
from the sport.
Keeping everyone interested in the game
Even though you distribute the biggest chunks of playing time to the most
talented players at the travel-team level, remember that every child —
whether she’s the team’s leading scorer or the least talented member of the
group — plays an important role. You’re responsible for making sure that
your players are fully aware of that fact.
When players are on the bench during games, you want them to be actively
involved in cheering their teammates on and supporting them. Also encourage
them to monitor the action closely. Having the players keep an eye on the
game not only holds their attention, but also enables them to spot weaknesses
of the opposing team that your team could exploit. Encouraging players to take
an active role in all areas of the game, whether they are on the field or not,
enhances their experience and further instills the message that they are
valuable members of the team.

f you’re looking for some clever ways to prepare your
players for a lacrosse game, or to help your goaltender
turn in a strong performance in the nets, you’ve come to
the right place. You also get the scoop on qualities that all
good lacrosse players possess and how you can instill
those traits in the kids under your care.

Chapter 20
Ten Qualities All Good Lacrosse
Players Possess
In This Chapter
 Mastering the basics
 Motivating and setting a shining example
 Focusing on the feet
L
acrosse requires a broad range of skills to play — let alone to play well.
Some kids naturally have a lot of the qualities that make a talented and
well-rounded player; others need to work a little bit harder to develop those
traits. As the coach, you can help instill these coveted qualities in your play-
ers to help them get the most out of their season playing for you.
Fanatical About the Fundamentals
One of the really neat things about lacrosse (besides the cool equipment) is
that those players who aren’t the biggest, strongest, or fastest can excel on
the field when they thoroughly understand the fundamental skills and how to
use them against opposing players. Although natural athletic ability is always
a bonus, it’s not a necessity for being a productive player at the offensive and
defensive ends of the field. Players who have mastered the fundamentals are
valuable to any team at any level of play, because they
 Understand how to pass the ball accurately while being defended.
 Have mastered catching and can snag passes on the run or in traffic.
 Know how to scoop up loose balls and are proficient at doing so.

One of the best approaches for instilling a love of the basics in players is to
continually stress their importance at every practice. The more your players
understand how passionate you are about these areas of the game, the more
of a liking they’ll take to them — and it’ll pay off in their performance. So,
during your practices be sure to make a big deal out of the little things play-
ers do well.
Loves the Game
Kids who are passionate about lacrosse tend to perform more efficiently, and
at higher levels, than those whose feelings for the sport are just so-so. You
can help fuel your players’ desire for the game by making practices fun-filled
experiences, and by reminding them that simply doing their best and putting
forth their maximum effort is what participating in lacrosse is all about. The
right coaching approach can lead a child to become enamored with lacrosse;
the wrong approach can spur him to look for another sport to participate in.
Devoted to Defense
All kids love running up and down the field with the ball and attacking on
offense, but what they do on defense often makes the biggest difference.
Because your team will spend roughly half of every game on defense, those
players who commit to excelling in this area of the game will be valuable
assets. By praising your players’ defensive tenacity and willingness to play as
enthusiastically without the ball as with it, you’ll help mold those coveted all-
around players, whom all coaches love for their ability to affect the game.
Cares Deeply About the Team
Scoring goals and hearing the applause from all the moms, dads, and grand-
parents ranks high on most players’ list. But the kids who care about making
the team better, even when they’re not the ones actually putting the ball in the
net, are truly the most valuable. How do you spot them? They’re the ones who
get genuinely excited when a teammate scores — maybe even more so than if
they had scored themselves. Some kids are naturally inclined to care more
about the team than about themselves. During your practices monitor your
compliments to make sure you aren’t zeroing in on just the ones scoring the
goals. Recognize the efforts of the players who made the passes that gener-
ated the scoring opportunity. When kids see that you applaud with as much
enthusiasm the passes that lead to goals as you do the actual goals, they’ll be
much more likely to buy into your team-oriented approach.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Master Motivator
Players can get their motivation for doing their best during practices and
games from many sources. Although coaches and parents are the most obvi-
ous motivators, teammates can also handle this role — and excel at it, too.
Some players have a natural gift for pushing their teammates to play with
more enthusiasm, to concentrate harder, and to strive for higher levels.
Although you need to understand the role that you play in motivating play-
ers, and how to best go about it (check out Chapter 2 for more details), when
you discover players who are good at motivating their teammates, take full
advantage of that skill. As you’ll see, many times kids respond much better to
teammates encouraging them and pushing them than they do to adults.
Never allow players to use intimidation tactics, cursing, or any demeaning
words while trying to push their teammates to higher levels of performance.
Fantastic with Footwork
In dancing, balancing on a tightrope, and playing lacrosse, the importance of
good footwork simply can’t be overstated. The better the footwork, the greater
the chance of success at both ends of the field. Lacrosse requires a great deal
of hand-eye coordination for passing and catching balls, but players must
rely on their feet to get into position to make those passes and catches.
On defense, a player’s ability to maneuver her feet takes on an even more
prominent role, because the better she is at moving in all directions — with
no notice — the better she can shut down opposing players. During your
practice drills (check out Chapters 7 and 14 for a wide selection of drills), be
sure to watch your players’ footwork so that they don’t develop bad habits
that will minimize their offensive and defensive effectiveness on game day.
A Good Sport
Sure, as a lacrosse coach, you love having players who possess powerful
shots that opposing goalies find impossible to stop, or who are so fleet of
foot that defenders struggle to keep up with them. Yet one of the most 
important characteristics — and often, one that doesn’t get the attention it
deserves — is being a good sport.
The essence of competing in lacrosse is to do your best and display good
sportsmanship at all times, win or lose. That can be tough when the team lost
a close game or certain calls didn’t go your way, but losses are part of the
341
Chapter 20: Ten Qualities All Good Lacrosse Players Possess

game. Make sure that your players understand that they can’t win all the time,
because they can’t control the outcome of games. The sooner they under-
stand that, the better. What they can control is how they behave during and
after games, which is a direct reflection on you, as both a coach and a person.
A Good Listener
No matter how good a coach you are, if you can’t get the players to soak up
your knowledge, your team won’t be nearly as effective as it could be. The
best lacrosse players recognize that the quickest route to learning and
improving is listening to the coaches. Good listening skills affect other
aspects of the game, too. At more-advanced levels of play, you may make
strategy adjustments at halftime. If some players aren’t listening, chances are
good that the team won’t perform as well as it could have, because everyone
wasn’t on the same page. Kids have short attention spans. Stick to simple
points and don’t resort to long-winded speeches. Remember, the less chance
you allow the kids’ minds to wander, the more they’ll learn from you.
Understands the Rules
If you take a vacation in a foreign country, your trip will be more enjoyable if
you understand the language. The same principle applies to lacrosse. The
better players understand the rules — many of which may seem fairly 
bizarre — the more fun they’ll have playing the game and the more effective
they’ll be on the field. (For a rundown on the rules of lacrosse, check out
Chapter 3.)
Leads by Example
The best teammates are the ones kids can look up to — and strive to 
emulate — because of their positive work ethic, attitude, and overall
approach to the game. These players help set a positive tone during practice
by working hard and having fun doing so, which naturally encourages other
teammates to follow in their footsteps. Continually talk to players about the
importance of working hard and doing their best at all times. Remind them
that they don’t have to be the most talented in order to make a difference in
games. It’s the kids who chase down loose balls that can swing games in their
team’s favor, and that’s accomplished simply by hustling at all times. Applaud
these traits in your players, and they’ll be more likely to embrace them.

for a Lacrosse Game

M
any aspects go into preparing a lacrosse team to take the field, and
you can go about the job in many ways. The better you are at getting
the kids ready for game day, the more likely they are to perform up to their
abilities — and to have a lot of fun at the same time.
From what to say in pregame practices to how you interact with your players
before taking the field, this chapter has you covered. Use the information pre-
sented here to prepare your players for an exciting, fun-filled day of lacrosse.
Scout the Opposition
If you’re coaching an advanced-level lacrosse team, one of the best ways to
prepare your team for the upcoming game is to check out the opponent ahead
of time. By attending one of the opposing team’s games, you can gain a good
perspective about how the players attack when they have the ball on offense,
which players take the majority of the shots, and how they tend to perform on
defense. You can share this valuable information with your players to let them
know which opponents they need to pay extra attention to in certain aspects
of the game.

Visualize Success
Visualization is a great tool to help your players get in the proper mindset to
play well. The night before a game, for example, encourage players to visual-
ize making accurate passes and scooping up loose balls, as well as perform-
ing other skills that they’ll rely on during the game. If a player has a positive
image in his head, that image will increase his chance of performing the skill
during the game just the way he imagined it.
Accentuate the Positive at Practice
You can help boost a team’s confidence and send it into the next game poised
to play well simply by choreographing the final minutes of your pregame
practice. This coaching trick is a great one to rely on, and here’s how it
works: In your last practice leading up to a game, run a drill that allows the
team to perform its strongest skill or run a play that it always does well. This
drill instills in kids a positive memory that they’ll take away from the field
with them — one that will reside in their memory banks on game day.
Express Your Enthusiasm
Youngsters involved in lacrosse want to play well to make their coaches, par-
ents, and other family members proud of them. You can help increase their
chances of turning in a strong performance by letting them know before the
game begins that you are eager to watch them in action. Just a few seconds of
praise are often enough to fuel a game-long boost in your players’ confidence
and self-esteem. You can talk to individual players about particular skills they
worked on in practice during the week and improved on, such as scooping up
loose balls or defending against an attacking player.
Accept Mistakes
The best lacrosse players in the collegiate and professional ranks drop
passes, overrun loose balls, and send passes sailing over teammates’ heads.
These events are known as mistakes, and they happen to everybody at every
level of play.
Although mistakes aren’t fun to make, your players must understand that
they happen from time to time. Players can’t allow mistakes to infringe on
their experience or affect the remainder of the game. If a player makes an
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

errant pass that is intercepted by the opposition, for example, he can’t
change his style of play and be afraid to make other passes.
Before the game, encourage players to push mistakes out of their mind the
moment they happen and to direct all their attention to the next play.
Sidestep the Pressure Phrases
Just like an attacking player sidestepping the check of an oncoming defender,
you must avoid using pressure phrases in your interactions with the team.
Setting a performance goal for the team — such as scoring eight goals in a
game or committing only five turnovers — may seem to be motivational, but
it can have the reverse effect of setting the kids up for disappointment. They
could play really well that day but leave the field frustrated because they
failed to reach your goal.
Your players can only give you their best efforts; they can’t control the out-
come of games.
Share Your Own Experiences
You can use your childhood experiences playing lacrosse, or any other orga-
nized sport, to help your players learn and grow. If you can share a humorous
experience with your team, that story lets them know that crazy things happen
to everyone on the lacrosse field and that they have to accept the unexpected.
If your players can learn to laugh about the quirks of the game, they’ll be able
to forget mistakes faster and can continue having fun playing the game.
Relating some of your childhood sports memories can also serve other pur-
poses. Telling your players how you overcame some adversity, for example,
lets them know that they can achieve success too.
Focus on the Fun Factor
Telling players to have fun during their lacrosse game is simple, straightfor-
ward, and to the point. It’s also one of the most important points you can
stress to young players. Don’t worry about overstating the fun factor, because
you really can’t do it enough. Participating in organized lacrosse — at any age
or ability level — must be fun, because playing the game is all about fun.
Instilling enjoyment in your players paves the way for a great day of lacrosse.
345
Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Prepare Players for a Lacrosse Game

Minimize Instructions
Kids are like sponges; they can soak up a lot of information. But if you get 
carried away with your instructions, whether during your pregame talk or
during the last practice before a game, chances are that they won’t retain as
much as you had hoped. Keep your instructions to a minimum. That way,
your main points are more likely to stick with the players, who are less likely
to become overwhelmed and confused.
Take a Few Deep Breaths
Sometimes, adults get nervous filing their tax returns, meeting the future 
in-laws for the first time, or asking an attractive co-worker out for dinner. We
get nervous because we really care about what happens (especially when it
comes to not getting shot down on that date request!).
By the same token, some of your players are likely to experience butterflies
in their stomachs before games. Nervousness is perfectly normal — and a
good indicator that they really care about the game and performing well in it.
Let them know that even professional athletes experience jitters before
games. To ensure that nerves don’t handcuff their ability to perform, have
them take a few deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling slowly, which helps calm
the body and relax the muscles.

Twelve Tips to Help Goaltenders
Excel in the Nets
In This Chapter
 Communicating with teammates — and yourself
 Thinking (and seeing) positive
 Staying on top of the game
G
oaltender is arguably the most difficult lacrosse position for kids to learn,
and you can easily see why: A ball keeps whipping at high speed toward
the net the goalie is protecting, with shots coming from all sorts of angles.
Compounding the difficulty of stopping these shots (which can arrive every-
where from low to the ground to shoulder high and above), other players are
moving back and forth in front of the net, obstructing the goalie’s vision.
For a rundown of the fundamentals of playing goaltender, check out Chapter
10. For some really good tips — if we do say so ourselves — to help your young
goalies excel at this position, read on.
Moving Past Mistakes
Being forgetful isn’t good when it comes to your anniversary or where you left
your car keys, but it’s a great trait for lacrosse goalies to adopt, and you can
help. When goaltenders surrender goals, they’re going to be disappointed —
understandably — but some kids take disappointment a lot harder than
others do.
During your practices, remind your goalies that they will give up goals during
games, because shutouts are rare and difficult to pull off. Emphasize the fact
that how they bounce back from lost goals makes the real difference in their

level of play. Work with them to shove the score out of their minds and focus
on the next shot or play. Let them know that if they spend time thinking
about the goal just scored, they won’t be able to devote their full attention to
the current play, which increases the likelihood of giving up a goal that they
might have been able to stop otherwise.
Exercising the Vocal Cords
Lacrosse is a team sport that requires constant communication, especially at
the defensive end of the field, to minimize scoring threats from the opposi-
tion. Because the goalie has the best view of the field and can spot plays
unfolding more easily than his teammates, who may have their backs turned
defending other players, he must let them know when they need to apply
pressure on a player, defend a cutter, or get out and cover a player who is
roaming free. They are also the field general and can’t be afraid to direct their
teammates on where they need to be based on the location of the ball or the
positioning of the opponent.
Goalies can make their jobs much easier, and be more successful in the
process, if they let their teammates know what needs to be done to tighten
defensive play.
Staying Alert
Maintaining complete concentration during an entire lacrosse game can be
pretty tough for a goaltender to pull off, especially if much of the play takes
place at the opposite end of the field. Also, other factors may vie for a
goalie’s attention, such as Grandma on the sidelines taking pictures or a
younger sibling trying to catch her eye.
To help keep a goalie’s attention from wandering off course, teach her tricks
she can use to maintain focus and stay sharp so that when the opposition is
attacking at her end of the field, she’ll be ready to make saves. When her
team is on the attack, for example, she can keep track of the number of
passes her teammates make or how many shots they generate on goal. The
goalie can also help point out tendencies he notices in the opposing goalie —
such as he always drops his stick low to the ground when a player winds up
to take a shot — that can benefit his teammates and lead to more goals.
Tracking the action keeps the goalie’s mind active and into the game, and
leaves less room for straying to nongame thoughts such as what she’s going
to do after the game or what she’s having for dinner.
348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Talking to Yourself
Having conversations with yourself can seem a bit abnormal, but for a
lacrosse goalie, one-sided chats can be as useful as quick reactions in stop-
ping shots. Being a successful goalie requires having not just good skills, but
also the confidence that when a shot is on the way, he’ll be able to turn it
away. Encourage your goalie to remind himself that he’s good at what he
does, which is why you’ve positioned him in front of the net.
Here are some other phrases you should encourage goalies to recite to 
themselves:
 “I love being challenged and making great saves.”
 “I will stop the next shot to help my team.”
 “I’m an excellent goalie.”
 “I’ve had a great week of practice and know I’m going to play really 
well today.”
Taking Some Deep Breaths
A little pre-game nervousness is fine, but too much of it can hinder reflexes
and cut down on effectiveness. The best lacrosse goalies are those who are
relaxed when the game begins. Sure, great reflexes and natural athletic ability
help, but relaxed goalies tend to fare better and have more success denying
shots than those who are uptight.
Teach your goalie to take a few long, deep breaths, sucking air all the way
into her lungs and then slowly exhaling. Deep breathing before the game
begins is the perfect antidote to unwanted nerves and helps relax the goalie’s
body so she can perform to the best of her ability.
Building Reflexes
Good reflexes come in handy for stopping shots and frustrating opponents.
Executing fundamental techniques is crucial to success in the nets (refer to
Chapter 10), but a goalie who knows that he has sharp reflexes knows that he
can challenge shooters and change the momentum of the game with a big
349
Chapter 22: Twelve Tips to Help Goaltenders Excel in the Nets

save — such as snatching an in-close shot out of the air in the blink of an eye.
Every practice should include a goalie drill that targets building reflexes.
Check out Chapters 7 and 14 for some drills that meet those needs.
Visualizing Positive Play
“If you see it, you can achieve it” may sound like a corny motivational phrase
or a sticker slapped on a car’s bumper, but in terms of making a youth
lacrosse goalie effective, this phrase really does pack some punch. Work with
your goalies to get them into the habit of visualizing stopping all sorts of
shots. The night before a game, while they’re lying in bed relaxed, encourage
them to spend five minutes picturing themselves making good saves. This
positive imagery can transfer over to game day and help them trust their 
ability. Before your practices start, have the goalies spend a moment visualiz-
ing having success stopping shots too, to help them get into the routine of
carrying over those thoughts and images to their actual play on the field.
Maintain Good Conditioning
Just because a goalie doesn’t do anywhere near the amount of running as an
attacker, or any of his other teammates, that doesn’t mean that conditioning
takes a backseat when playing in front of the net. A goalie is required to move
from side to side, and make lots of sudden moves, all of which can tire him
out and lead to slower reaction times when dealing with opponents’ shots.
Goalies must take pride in their conditioning, because the stronger they are
and the better shape they’re in, the more success they’ll enjoy denying goals.
Focus on Becoming a 
Well-Rounded Player
Being a lacrosse goalie that opponents cringe facing means being skillful in 
different aspects of the game. Stopping shots is the top priority for any goalie,
but there’s more to it. Goalies who are excellent passers can spark fast-break
attacks that keep the opposition off balance. Goalies should be encouraged 
to work on their passing skills, during practice and at home with family or
friends if they are interested in improving in this area. During your practice
drills don’t just have your goalies stop shots and simply toss the ball to the
side. Incorporate passing components so this area isn’t neglected. A goalie
who can make accurate passes to help his team get out of the defensive zone
makes life easier on himself because that translates into fewer shots he’ll 
have to face — and more the opposing goalie may see instead.
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Being Observant Before the Game
Goalies can learn a lot about an opponent by observing them — before the
game begins. At the advanced levels of lacrosse, you want your goalies to
spend a little time evaluating the opposition. He can spend a couple of min-
utes watching the opponent warm-up, where he may notice certain tendencies
in how players shoot the ball, or where they aim the majority of their shots.
For example, maybe certain attackers always shoot low to the left corner.
Having this knowledge could make the difference between making a save and
giving up a goal when he is faced defending a shot from this player during the
game. You don’t want him to spend a lot of time observing, but a few minutes
can be useful in succeeding in certain situations. Sending players out onto the
field who are confident in their abilities is important, but even more so for
your goaltender since she is the last line of defense for preventing opponents
from celebrating goals. During your team’s pre-game warm-up it’s a good idea
to hover around the net and sprinkle positive comments toward her about
how well she’s positioning herself on shots or how sharp her reflexes look
today. This can build confidence and fuel top performances. 
Molding Well-Rounded Players
Being a lacrosse goalie whom opponents cringe playing against requires
being well-rounded in many different aspects of the game. Sure, stopping
shots is the top priority for any goalie, but that is only one dimension of the
position. Goalies who are excellent passers can spark fast-break attacks that
keep the opposition off balance. During your practice drills don’t just have
your goalies stop shots and simply toss the ball to the side. Incorporate pass-
ing components too, so this area of the game isn’t neglected. A goalie who
can make accurate passes to help his team get out of the defensive zone
helps himself because it means fewer shots he’ll have to face.
Divulging Tendencies
A lot goes into making a save on a shot: footwork, positioning, hand-eye 
coordination, and even a little insight from you. At the advanced levels of
lacrosse, spend some time evaluating the opposition. While you or an assis-
tant watch their pre-game warm-up, you may notice certain tendencies that
your goalie could benefit from knowing. Maybe certain attackers always
shoot low to the left corner. This knowledge can make the difference between
making a save and giving up a goal if your goalie is faced defending a shot
from this player during the game. You don’t want to overwhelm the goalie
with too much information, but a few tidbits can sometimes be useful.
